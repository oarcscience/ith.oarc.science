### <span id="ii.ii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Be humble, and believe that Christ will come again.

<span id="ii.ii.xxiii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxiii-p1.1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxiii-p1.2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxiii-p1.3"></span>The all-merciful and beneficent Father has
bowels \[of compassion\] towards those that fear Him, and kindly and
lovingly bestows His favours upon those who come to Him with a simple
mind. Wherefore let us not be double-minded; neither let our soul be
lifted <span id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) up on account of His
exceedingly great and glorious gifts. Far from us be that which is
written, “Wretched are they who are of a double mind, and of a doubting
heart; who say, These things we have heard even in the times of our
fathers; but, behold, we have grown old, and none of them has happened
unto us.” <span id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) Ye foolish ones! compare
yourselves to a tree: take \[for instance\] the vine. First of all, it
sheds its leaves, then it buds, next it puts forth leaves, and then it
flowers; after that comes the sour grape, and then follows the ripened
fruit. Ye perceive how in a little time the fruit of a tree comes to
maturity. <span id="ii.ii.xxiii-p3.3"></span>Of a truth, soon and
suddenly shall His will be accomplished, as the Scripture also bears
witness, saying, “Speedily will He come, and will not tarry;” <span
id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) and, “The Lord shall suddenly come to
His temple, even the Holy One, for whom ye look.” <span
id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md)
