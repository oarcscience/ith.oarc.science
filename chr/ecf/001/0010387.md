### <span id="viii.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The demons misrepresent Christian doctrine.

<span id="viii.ii.xiv-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>For
we forewarn you to be on your guard, lest those demons whom we have been
accusing should deceive you, and quite divert you from reading and
understanding what we say. For they strive to hold you their slaves and
servants; and sometimes by appearances in dreams, and sometimes by
magical impositions, they subdue all who make no strong opposing effort
for their own salvation. And thus do we also, since our persuasion by
the Word, stand aloof from them (i.e., the demons), and follow the only
unbegotten God through His Son —we who formerly delighted in
fornication, but now embrace chastity alone; we who formerly used
magical arts, dedicate ourselves to the good and unbegotten God; we who
valued above all things the acquisition of wealth and possessions, now
bring what we have into a common stock, and communicate to every one in
need; we who hated and destroyed one another, and on account of their
different manners would not live <span
id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782) with men of a different tribe, now,
since the coming of Christ, live familiarly with them, and pray for our
enemies, and endeavour to persuade those who hate us unjustly to live
conformably to the good precepts of Christ, to the end that they may
become partakers with us of the same joyful hope of a reward from God
the ruler of all. But lest we should seem to be reasoning sophistically,
we consider it right, before giving you the promised <span
id="fr_1783"></span>[1784](#fn_1783) explanation, to cite a few precepts
given by Christ Himself. And be it yours, as powerful rulers, to inquire
whether we have been taught and do teach these things truly. Brief and
concise utterances fell from Him, for He was no sophist, but His word
was the power of God.
