### <span id="v.xxv.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Ignatius appears in a vision after his death.

<span id="v.xxv.vii-p1"></span><span id="v.xxv.vii-p1.1"></span>Now
these things took place on the thirteenth day before the Kalends of
January, that is, on the twentieth of December, <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434) Sura and Senecio being then the
consuls of the Romans for the second time. Having ourselves been
eye-witnesses of these things, and having spent the whole night in tears
within the house, and having entreated the Lord, with bended knees and
much prayer, that He would give us weak men full assurance respecting
the things which were done, <span id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435)
it came to pass, on our falling into a brief slumber, that some of us
saw the blessed Ignatius suddenly standing by us and embracing us, while
others beheld him again praying for us, and others still saw him
dropping with sweat, as if he had just come from his great labour, and
standing by the Lord. When, therefore, we had with great joy witnessed
these things, and had compared our several visions <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436) together, we sang praise to God,
the giver of all good things, and expressed our sense of the happiness
of the holy \[martyr\]; and now we have made known to you both the day
and the time \[when these things happened\], that, assembling ourselves
together according to the time of his martyrdom, we may have fellowship
with the champion and noble martyr of Christ, who trod under foot the
devil, and perfected the course which, out of love to Christ, he had
desired, in Christ Jesus our Lord; by whom, and with whom, be glory and
power to the Father, with the Holy Spirit, for evermore! Amen.
