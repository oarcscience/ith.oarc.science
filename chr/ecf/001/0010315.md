### <span id="v.xix.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Commendation and exhortation.

<span id="v.xix.iv-p1"></span>Now it occurs to me to mention, that the
report is true which I heard of thee whilst thou wast at Rome with the
blessed father <span id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381.md) Linus, whom
the deservedly-blessed Clement, a hearer of Peter and Paul, has now
succeeded. And by this time thou hast added a hundred-fold to thy
reputation; and may thou, O woman! still further increase it. I greatly
desired to come unto you, that I might have rest with you; but “the way
of man is not in himself.” <span id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md)
For the military guard \[under which I am kept\] hinders my purpose, and
does not permit me to go further. Nor indeed, in the state I am now in,
can I either do or suffer anything. Wherefore deeming the practice of
writing the second resource <span id="page_123">p. 123</span> <span
id="v.xix.iv-Page_123"></span> of friends for their mutual
encouragement, I salute thy sacred soul, beseeching of thee to add still
further to thy vigour. For our present labour is but little, while the
reward which is expected is great.
