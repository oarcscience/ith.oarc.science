### <span id="viii.iii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Christ compared with Socrates.

<span id="viii.iii.x-p1"></span><span id="viii.iii.x-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iii.x-p1.2"></span>Our doctrines, then, appear to be greater
than all human teaching; because Christ, who appeared for our sakes,
became the whole rational being, both body, and reason, and soul. For I
whatever either lawgivers or philosophers uttered well, they elaborated
by finding and contemplating some part of the Word. <span
id="viii.iii.x-p1.3"></span><span id="viii.iii.x-p1.4"></span>But since
they I did not know the whole of the Word, which is Christ, they often
contradicted themselves. And those who by human birth were more ancient
than Christ, when they attempted to consider and prove things by reason,
were brought before the tribunals as impious persons and busybodies. And
Socrates, who was more zealous in this direction than all of them, was
accused of the very same crimes as ourselves. For they said that he was
introducing new divinities, and did not consider those to be gods whom
the state recognised. But he cast out from the state both Homer <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936) and the rest of the poets, and
taught men to reject the wicked demons and those who did the things
which the poets related; and he exhorted them to become acquainted with
the God who was to them unknown, by means of the investigation of
reason, saying, “That it is neither easy to find the Father and Maker of
all, nor, having found Him, is it safe to declare Him to all.” <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937) But these things our Christ did
through His own power. <span id="viii.iii.x-p3.1"></span><span
id="viii.iii.x-p3.2"></span>For no one trusted in Socrates so as to die
for this doctrine, but in Christ, who was partially known even by
Socrates (for He was and is the Word who is in every man, and who
foretold the things that were to come to pass both through the prophets
and in His own person when He was made of like passions, and taught
these things), not only philosophers and scholars believed, but also
artisans and people entirely uneducated, despising both glory, and fear,
and <span id="page_192">p. 192</span> <span
id="viii.iii.x-Page_192"></span> death; since He is a power of the
ineffable Father, not the mere instrument of human reason. <span
id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938)
