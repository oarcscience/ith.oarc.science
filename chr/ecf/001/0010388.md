### <span id="viii.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—What Christ himself taught.

<span id="viii.ii.xv-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii.xv-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xv-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.ii.xv-p1.3"></span>Concerning
chastity, He uttered such sentiments as these: <span
id="fr_1784"></span>[1785](#fn_1784) “Whosoever looketh upon a woman to
lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart
before God.” And, “If thy right eye offend thee, cut it out; for it is
better for thee to enter into the kingdom of heaven with one eye, than,
having two eyes, to be cast into everlasting fire.” <span
id="viii.ii.xv-p2.1"></span>And, “Whosoever shall marry her that is
divorced from another husband, committeth adultery.” <span
id="fr_1785"></span>[1786](#fn_1785) And, “There are some who have been
made eunuchs of men, and some who were born eunuchs, and some who have
made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake; but all cannot
receive this saying.” <span id="fr_1786"></span>[1787](#fn_1786) So that
all who, by human law, are twice married, <span
id="fr_1787"></span>[1788](#fn_1787) are in the eye of our Master
sinners, and those who look upon a woman to lust after her. For not only
he who in act commits adultery is rejected by Him, but also he who
desires to commit adultery: since not only our works, but also our
thoughts, are open before God. And many, both men and women, who have
been Christ’s disciples from childhood, remain pure at the age of sixty
or seventy years; and I boast that I could produce such from every race
of men. For what shall I say, too, of the countless multitude of those
who have reformed intemperate habits, and learned these things? <span
id="viii.ii.xv-p5.2"></span>For Christ called not the just nor the
chaste to repentance, but the ungodly, and the licentious, and the
unjust; His words being, “I came not to call the righteous, but sinners
to repentance.” <span id="fr_1788"></span>[1789](#fn_1788) For the
heavenly Father desires rather the repentance than the punishment of the
sinner. And of our love to all, He taught thus: “If ye love them that
love you, what new thing do ye? for even fornicators do this. But I say
unto you, Pray for your enemies, and love them that hate you, and bless
them that curse you, and pray for them that despitefully use you.” <span
id="fr_1789"></span>[1790](#fn_1789) And that we should communicate to
the needy, and do nothing for glory, He said, “Give to him that asketh,
and from him that would borrow turn not away; for if ye lend to them of
whom ye hope to receive, what new thing do ye? even the publicans do
this. Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth, where moth and rust
doth corrupt, and where robbers break through; but lay up for yourselves
treasure in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt. For what
is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own
soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for it? Lay up treasure,
therefore, in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt.” <span
id="fr_1790"></span>[1791](#fn_1790) And, “Be ye kind and merciful, as
your Father also is kind and merciful, and maketh His sun to rise on
sinners, and the righteous, and the wicked. <span id="page_168">p.
168</span> <span id="viii.ii.xv-Page_168"></span> Take no thought what
ye shall eat, or what ye shall put on: are ye not better than the birds
and the beasts? And God feedeth them. Take no thought, therefore, what
ye shall eat, or what ye shall put on; for your heavenly Father knoweth
that ye have need of these things. But seek ye the kingdom of heaven,
and all these things shall be added unto you. For where his treasure is,
there also is the mind of a man.” <span
id="fr_1791"></span>[1792](#fn_1791) And, “Do not these things to be
seen of men; otherwise ye have no reward from your Father which is in
heaven.” <span id="fr_1792"></span>[1793](#fn_1792)

<span id="viii.ii.xv-p2"></span> The reader will notice that Justin
quotes from memory, so that there are some slight discrepancies between
the words of Jesus as here cited, and the same sayings as recorded in
our Gospels.

id="viii.ii.xv-p5.1"></span>διγαμίας ποιούμενοι</span>, lit. contracting
a double marriage. Of double marriages there are three kinds: the first,
marriage with a second wife while the first is still alive and
recognised as a lawful wife, or bigamy; the second, marriage with a
second wife after divorce from the first, and third, marriage with a
second wife after the death of the first. It is thought that Justin here
refers to the second case.
