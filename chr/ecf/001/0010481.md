### <span id="viii.iv.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Why choice of meats was prescribed.

<span id="viii.iv.xx-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xx-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xx-p1.2"></span>“Moreover, you were commanded to abstain
from certain kinds of food, in order that you might keep God before your
eyes while you ate and drank, seeing that you were prone and very ready
to depart from His knowledge, as Moses also affirms: ‘The people ate and
drank, and rose up to play.’ <span id="fr_1993"></span>[1994](#fn_1993.md)
And again: ‘Jacob ate, and was satisfied, and waxed fat; and he who was
beloved kicked: he waxed fat, he grew thick, he was enlarged, and he
forsook God who had made him.’ <span
id="fr_1994"></span>[1995](#fn_1994.md) For it was told you by Moses in the
book of Genesis, that God granted to Noah, being a just man, to eat of
every animal, but not of flesh with the blood, which is *dead*.” <span
id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995.md) And as he was ready to say, “as the
green herbs,” I anticipated him: “Why do you not receive this statement,
‘as the green herbs,’ in the sense in which it was given by God, to wit,
that just as God has granted the herbs for sustenance to man, even so
has He given the animals for the diet of flesh? But, you say, a
distinction was laid down thereafter to Noah, because we do not eat
certain herbs. As you interpret it, the thing is incredible. And first I
shall not occupy myself with this, though able to say and to hold that
every vegetable is food, and fit to be eaten. But although we
discriminate between green herbs, not eating all, we refrain from eating
some, not because they are common or unclean, but because they are
bitter, or deadly, or thorny. But we lay hands on and take of all herbs
which are sweet, very nourishing and good, whether they are marine or
land plants. Thus also God by the mouth of Moses commanded you to
abstain from unclean and improper <span
id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996.md) and violent animals: when,
moreover, though you were eating manna in the desert, and were seeing
all those wondrous acts wrought for you by God, you made and worshipped
the golden calf. <span id="fr_1997"></span>[1998](#fn_1997.md) Hence he
cries continually, and justly, ‘They are foolish children, in whom is no
faith.’ <span id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998.md)

<span id="viii.iv.xx-p6"></span> “The reasoning of St. Justin is not
quite clear to interpreters. As we abstain from some herbs, not because
they are forbidden by law, but because they are deadly; so the law of
abstinence from improper and violent animals was imposed not on Noah,
but on you as a yoke on account of your sins.”—<span class="upper"><span
