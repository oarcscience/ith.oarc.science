### <span id="viii.ii.xxxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.—Utterances of the Son.

<span id="viii.ii.xxxviii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>And when the Spirit of prophecy speaks
from the person of Christ, the utterances are of this sort: “I have
spread out My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people, to those who
walk in a way that is not good.” <span
id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843) And again: “I gave My back to the
scourges, and My cheeks to the buffetings; I turned not away My face
from the shame of spittings; and the Lord was My helper: therefore was I
not confounded: but I set My face as a firm rock; and I knew that I
should not be ashamed, for He is near that justifieth Me.” <span
id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844) <span
id="viii.ii.xxxviii-p3.2"></span>And again, when He says, “They cast
lots upon My vesture, and pierced My hands and My feet. And I lay down
and slept, and rose again, because the Lord sustained Me.” <span
id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845) And again, when He says, “They
spake with their lips, they wagged the head, saying, Let Him deliver
Himself.” <span id="fr_1846"></span>[1847](#fn_1846) And that all these
things happened to Christ at the hands of the Jews, you can ascertain.
For when He was crucified, they did shoot out the lip, and wagged their
heads, saying, “Let Him who raised the dead save Himself.” <span
id="fr_1847"></span>[1848](#fn_1847)
