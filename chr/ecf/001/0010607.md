### <span id="viii.v.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Follies of the Greek mythology.

<span id="viii.v.iii-p1"></span><span id="viii.v.iii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.v.iii-p1.2"></span>For Hercules, celebrated by his three
nights, <span id="fr_2499"></span>[2500](#fn_2499) sung by the poets for
his successful labours, the son of Jupiter, who slew the lion and
destroyed the many-headed hydra; who put to death the fierce and mighty
boar, and was able to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up
from Hades the three-headed dog; who effectually cleansed the huge
Augean building from its dung, and killed the bulls and the stag whose
nostrils breathed fire, and plucked the golden fruit from the tree, and
slew the poisonous serpent (and for some reason, which it is not lawful
to utter, killed Achelous, and the guest-slaying Busiris), and crossed
the mountains that he might get water which gave forth an articulate
speech, as the story goes: he who was able to do so many and such like
and so great deeds as these, how childishly he was delighted to be
stunned by the cymbals of the satyrs, and to be conquered by the love of
woman, and to be struck on the hips by the laughing Lyda! And at last,
not being able to put off the tunic of Nessus, himself kindling his own
funeral pile, so he died. Let Vulcan lay aside his envy, and not be
jealous if he is hated because he is old and club-footed, and Mars
loved, because young and beautiful. Since, therefore, ye Greeks, your
gods are convicted of intemperance, and your heroes are effeminate, as
the histories on which your dramas are founded have declared, such as
the curse of Atreus, the bed of Thyestes <span
id="fr_2500"></span>[2501](#fn_2500) and the taint in the house of
Pelops, and Danaus murdering through hatred and making Ægyptus childless
in the intoxication of his rage, and the Thyestean banquet spread by the
Furies. <span id="fr_2501"></span>[2502](#fn_2501) And Procne is to this
day flitting about, lamenting; and her sister of Athens shrills with her
tongue cut out. For what need is there of speaking of the goad <span
id="fr_2502"></span>[2503](#fn_2502) of Œdipus, and the murder of Laius,
and the marrying his mother, and the mutual slaughter of those who were
at once his brothers and his sons?

<span id="viii.v.iii-p2"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.v.iii-p2.1"></span>Τριέσπερον</span>, so called, as some think,
\[from his origin: “*ex concubitu trium noctium.*”\]

<span id="fn_2500"></span>[272:2501](0010607.htm#fr_2500) <span
id="viii.v.iii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="viii.v.iii-p3"></span> Thyestes seduced the wife of his
brother Atreus, whence the tragic career of the family.

<span id="fn_2501"></span>[272:2502](0010607.htm#fr_2501) <span
id="viii.v.iii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v.iii-p4"></span> There is no apodosis in the Greek.

<span id="fn_2502"></span>[272:2503](0010607.htm#fr_2502) <span
id="viii.v.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v.iii-p5"></span> Not, as the editors dispute, either the
tongue of the buckle with which he put out his eyes, nor the awl with
which his heels were bored through, but the goad with which he killed
his father.
