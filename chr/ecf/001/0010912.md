### <span id="ix.viii.xxxvii-p0.1"></span>XXXVII.

<span id="ix.viii.xxxvii-p1"></span>Those who have become acquainted
with the secondary (i.e., under Christ) constitutions of the
apostles, <span id="fr_4867"></span>[4868](#fn_4867) are aware that the
Lord instituted a new oblation in the new covenant, according to \[the
declaration of\] Malachi the prophet. For, “from the rising of the sun
even to the setting my name has been glorified among the Gentiles, and
in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure
sacrifice;” <span id="fr_4868"></span>[4869](#fn_4868) as John also
declares in the Apocalypse: “The incense is the prayers of the
saints.” <span id="fr_4869"></span>[4870](#fn_4869) Then again, Paul
exhorts us “to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
unto God, which is your reasonable service.” <span
id="fr_4870"></span>[4871](#fn_4870) And again, “Let us offer the
sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of the lips.” <span
id="fr_4871"></span>[4872](#fn_4871) Now those oblations are not
according to the law, the handwriting of which the Lord took away from
the midst by cancelling it; <span id="fr_4872"></span>[4873](#fn_4872)
but they are according to the Spirit, for we must worship God “in spirit
and in truth.” <span id="fr_4873"></span>[4874](#fn_4873) And therefore
the oblation of the Eucharist is not a carnal one, but a spiritual; and
in this respect it is pure. For we make an oblation to God of the bread
and the cup of blessing, giving Him thanks in that He has commanded the
earth to bring forth these fruits for our nourishment. And then, when we
have perfected the oblation, we invoke the Holy Spirit, that He may
exhibit this sacrifice, both the bread the body of Christ, and the cup
the blood of Christ, in order that the receivers of these
antitypes <span id="fr_4874"></span>[4875](#fn_4874) may obtain
remission of sins and life eternal. Those persons, then, who perform
these oblations in remembrance <span id="page_575">p. 575</span> <span
id="ix.viii.xxxvii-Page_575"></span> of the Lord, do not fall in with
Jewish views, but, performing the service after a spiritual manner, they
shall be called sons of wisdom.

constitution, which the apostles, acting under the impulse of the
Spirit, though still in a secondary capacity, gave to the Church.”

<span id="ix.viii.xxxvii-p9"></span> Harvey explains this word <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.viii.xxxvii-p9.1"></span>ἀντιτύπων</span> as
meaning an “exact counterpart.” He refers to the word where it occurs in
*Contra Hæreses*, lib. i. chap. xxiv. (p. 349, this vol.) as
confirmatory of his view.
