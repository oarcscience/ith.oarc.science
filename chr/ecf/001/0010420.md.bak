### <span id="viii.ii.xlvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLVII.—Desolation of Judæa foretold.

<span id="viii.ii.xlvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>That the land of the Jews, then, was to
be laid waste, hear what was said by the Spirit of prophecy. And the
words were spoken as if from the person of the people wondering at what
had happened. They are these: “Sion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a
desolation. The house of our sanctuary has become a curse, and the glory
which our fathers blessed is burned up with fire, and all its glorious
things are laid waste: and Thou refrainest Thyself at these things, and
hast held Thy peace, and hast humbled us very sore.” <span
id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md) And ye are convinced that Jerusalem
has been laid waste, as was predicted. And concerning its desolation,
and that no one should be permitted to inhabit it, there was the
following prophecy by Isaiah: “Their land is desolate, their enemies
consume it before them, and none of them shall dwell therein.” <span
id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) And that it is guarded by you lest
any one dwell in it, and that death is decreed against a Jew apprehended
entering it, you know very well. <span
