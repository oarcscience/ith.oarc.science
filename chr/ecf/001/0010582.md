### <span id="viii.iv.cxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXI.—From the fact that the Gentiles believe in Jesus, it is evident that He is Christ.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.cxxi-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxi-p1.3"></span>And as they kept silence, I went on:
“\[The Scripture\], speaking by David about this Christ, my friends,
said no longer that ‘in His seed’ the nations should be blessed, but ‘in
Him.’ So it is here: ‘His name shall rise up for ever above the sun; and
in Him shall all nations be blessed.’ <span
id="fr_2411"></span>[2412](#fn_2411.md) But if all nations are blessed in
Christ, and we of all nations believe in Him, then He is indeed the
Christ, and we are those blessed by Him. God formerly gave the sun as an
object of worship, <span id="fr_2412"></span>[2413](#fn_2412.md) as it is
written, but no one ever was seen to endure death on account of his
faith in the sun; but for the name of Jesus you may see men of every
nation who have endured and do endure all sufferings, rather than deny
Him. For the word of His truth and wisdom is more ardent and more
light-giving than the rays of the sun, and sinks down into the depths of
heart and mind. Hence also the Scripture said, ‘His name shall rise up
above the sun.’ And again, Zechariah says, ‘His name is the East.’ <span
id="fr_2413"></span>[2414](#fn_2413.md) And speaking of the same, he says
that ‘each tribe shall mourn.’ <span
id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414.md) <span
id="viii.iv.cxxi-p5.2"></span>But if He so shone forth and was so mighty
in His first advent (which was without honour and comeliness, and very
contemptible), that in no nation He is unknown, and everywhere men have
repented of the old wickedness in each nation’s way of living, so that
even demons were subject to His name, and all powers and kingdoms feared
His name more than they feared all the dead, shall He not on His
glorious advent destroy by all means all those who hated Him, and who
unrighteously departed from Him, but give rest to His own, rewarding
them with all they have looked for? To us, therefore, it has been
granted to hear, and to understand, and to be saved by this Christ, and
to recognise all the \[truths revealed\] by the Father. Wherefore He
said to Him: ‘It is a great thing for Thee to be called my servant, to
raise up the tribes of Jacob, and turn again the dispersed of Israel. I
have appointed Thee for a light to the Gentiles, that Thou mayest be
their salvation unto the end of the earth.’ <span
