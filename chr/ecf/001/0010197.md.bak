### <span id="v.vi.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Congratulate the inhabitants of Antioch on the close of the persecution.

<span id="v.vi.x-p1"></span><span id="v.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Since,
according to your prayers, and the compassion which ye feel in Christ
Jesus, it is reported to me that the Church which is at Antioch in Syria
possesses peace, it will become you, as a Church of God, to elect a
deacon to act as the ambassador of God \[for you\] to \[the brethren
there\], that he may rejoice along with them when they are met together,
and glorify the name \[of God\]. Blessed is he in Jesus Christ, who
shall be deemed worthy of such a ministry; and ye too shall be
glorified. <span id="v.vi.x-p1.2"></span>And if ye are willing, it is
not beyond your power to do this, for the sake <span
id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964.md) of God; as also the nearest Churches
have sent, in some cases bishops, and in others presbyters and deacons.
