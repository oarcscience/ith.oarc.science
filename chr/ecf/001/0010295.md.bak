### <span id="v.xvii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Continuation: inconsistency of Satan.

<span id="v.xvii.vii-p1"></span><span id="v.xvii.vii-p1.1"></span>And
how, again, does Christ not at all appear to thee to be of the Virgin,
but to be God over all, <span id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329.md) and
the Almighty? Say, then, who sent Him? Who was Lord over Him? And whose
will did He obey? And what laws did He fulfil, since He was subject
neither to the will nor power of any one? And while you deny that Christ
was born, <span id="fr_1330"></span>[1331](#fn_1330.md) you affirm that the
unbegotten was begotten, and that He who had no beginning <span
id="page_118">p. 118</span> <span id="v.xvii.vii-Page_118"></span> was
nailed to the cross, by whose permission I am unable to say. But thy
changeable tactics do not escape me, nor am I ignorant that thou art
wont to walk with slanting and uncertain <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[1332](#fn_1331.md) steps. And thou art ignorant who
really was born, thou who pretendest to know everything.
