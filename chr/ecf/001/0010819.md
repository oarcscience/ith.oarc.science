### <span id="ix.vi.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—The conversion of the Gentiles was more difficult than that of the Jews; the labours of those apostles, therefore who engaged in the former task, were greater than those who undertook the latter.

<span id="ix.vi.xxv-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Wherefore also Paul, since he was the apostle
of the Gentiles, says, “I laboured more than they all.” <span
id="fr_4136"></span>[4137](#fn_4136.md) For the instruction of the former,
\[viz., the Jews,\] was an easy task, because they could allege proofs
from the Scriptures, and because they, who were in the habit of hearing
Moses and the prophets, did also readily receive the First-begotten of
the dead, and the Prince of the life of God, —Him who, by the spreading
forth of hands, did destroy Amalek, and vivify man from the wound of the
serpent, by means of faith which was \[exercised\] towards Him. As I
have pointed out in the preceding book, the apostle did, in the first
place, instruct the Gentiles to depart from the superstition of idols,
and to worship one God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and the Framer
of the whole creation; and that His Son was His Word, by whom He founded
all things; and that He, in the last times, was made a man among men;
that He reformed the human race, but destroyed and conquered the enemy
of man, and gave to His handiwork victory against the adversary. But
although they who were of the circumcision still did not obey the words
of God, for they were despisers, yet they were previously instructed not
to commit adultery, nor fornication, nor theft, nor fraud; and that
whatsoever things are done to our neighbours’ prejudice, were evil, and
detested by God. Wherefore also they did readily agree to abstain from
these things, because they had been thus instructed.

<span id="ix.vi.xxv-p3"></span>2. But they were bound to teach the
Gentiles also this very thing, that works of such a nature were wicked,
prejudicial, and useless, and destructive to those who engaged in them.
Wherefore he who had received the apostolate to the Gentiles, <span
id="fr_4137"></span>[4138](#fn_4137.md) did labour more than those who
preached the Son of God among them of the circumcision. For they were
assisted by the Scriptures, which the Lord confirmed and fulfilled, in
coming such as He had been announced; but here, \[in the case of the
Gentiles,\] there was a certain foreign erudition, and a new doctrine
\[to be received, namely\], that the gods of the nations not only were
no gods at all, but even the idols of demons; and that there is one God,
who is “above all principality, and dominion, and power, and every name
which is named;” <span id="fr_4138"></span>[4139](#fn_4138.md) and that His
Word, invisible by nature, was made palpable and visible among men, and
did descend “to death, even the death of the cross;” <span
id="fr_4139"></span>[4140](#fn_4139.md) also, that they who believe in Him
shall be incorruptible and not subject to suffering, and shall receive
the kingdom of heaven. These things, too, were preached to the Gentiles
by word, without \[the aid of\] the Scriptures: wherefore, also, they
who preached among the Gentiles underwent greater labour. But, on the
other hand, the faith of the Gentiles is proved to be of a more noble
description, since they followed the word of God without the instruction
\[derived\] from the \[sacred\] writings (*sine instructione
literarum*).
