### <span id="viii.ii.li-p0.1"></span>Chapter LI.—The majesty of Christ.

<span id="viii.ii.li-p1"></span>And that the Spirit of prophecy might
signify to us that He who suffers these things has an ineffable origin,
and rules His enemies, He spake thus: “His generation who shall declare?
because His life is cut off from the earth: for their transgressions He
comes to death. And I will give the wicked for His burial, and the rich
for His death; because He did no violence, neither was any deceit in His
mouth. And the Lord is pleased to cleanse Him from the stripe. If He be
given for sin, your soul shall see His seed <span id="page_180">p.
180</span> <span id="viii.ii.li-Page_180"></span> prolonged in days. And
the Lord is pleased to deliver His soul from grief, to show Him light,
and to form Him with knowledge, to justify the righteous who richly
serveth many. And He shall bear our iniquities. Therefore He shall
inherit many, and He shall divide the spoil of the strong; because His
soul was delivered to death: and He was numbered with the transgressors;
and He bare the sins of many, and He was delivered up for their
transgressions.” <span id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md) <span
id="viii.ii.li-p2.2"></span>Hear, too, how He was to ascend into heaven
according to prophecy. It was thus spoken: “Lift up the gates of heaven;
be ye opened, that the King of glory may come in. Who is this King of
glory? The Lord, strong and mighty.” <span
id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md) And how also He should come again
out of heaven with glory, hear what was spoken in reference to this by
the prophet Jeremiah. <span id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873.md) His
words are: “Behold, as the Son of man He cometh in the clouds of heaven,
and His angels with Him.” <span id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md)
