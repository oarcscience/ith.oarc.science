### <span id="v.v.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Reason of desiring to die.

<span id="v.v.vii-p1"></span><span id="v.v.vii-p1.1"></span>The prince
of this world would fain carry me away, and corrupt my disposition
towards God. Let none of you, therefore, who are \[in Rome\] help him;
rather be ye on my side, that is, on the side of God. Do not speak of
Jesus Christ, and yet set your desires on the world. Let not envy find a
dwelling-place among you; nor even should I, when present with you,
exhort you to it, be ye persuaded to listen to me, but rather give
credit to those things which I now write to you. For though I am alive
while I write to you, yet I am eager to die. My love <span
id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865) has been crucified, and there is no
<span id="page_77">p. 77</span> <span id="v.v.vii-Page_77"></span> fire
in me desiring to be fed; <span id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866) but
there is within me a water that liveth and speaketh, <span
id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867) saying to me inwardly, Come to the
Father. I have no delight in corruptible food, nor in the pleasures of
this life. <span id="v.v.vii-p4.2"></span>I desire the bread of God, the
heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed of David and Abraham;
and I desire the drink of God, namely His blood, which is incorruptible
love and eternal life.

<span id="v.v.vii-p5"></span><span id="v.v.vii-p5.1"></span>The prince
of this world would fain carry me away, and corrupt my disposition
towards God. Let none of you, therefore, who are \[in Rome\] help him;
rather be ye on my side, that is, on the side of God. Do not speak of
Jesus Christ, and yet prefer this world to Him. Let not envy find a
dwelling-place among you; nor even should I, when present with you,
exhort you to it, be ye persuaded, but rather give credit to those
things which I now write to you. For though I am alive while I write to
you, yet I am eager to die for the sake of Christ. My love <span
id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868) has been crucified, and there is no
fire in me that loves anything; but there is living water springing up
in me, <span id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869) and which says to me
inwardly, Come to the Father. I have no delight in corruptible food, nor
in the pleasures of this life. <span id="v.v.vii-p7.2"></span>I desire
the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the
flesh of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed
of David and Abraham; and I desire the drink, namely His blood, which is
incorruptible love and eternal life.
