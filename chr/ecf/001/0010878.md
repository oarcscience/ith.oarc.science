### <span id="ix.viii.iii-p0.1"></span>III.

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.iii-p1.1"></span>For <span
id="fr_4799"></span>[4800](#fn_4799) the controversy is not merely as
regards the day, but also as regards the form itself of the fast. <span
id="fr_4800"></span>[4801](#fn_4800) For some consider themselves bound
to fast one day, others two days, others still more, while others \[do
so during\] forty: the diurnal and the nocturnal hours they measure out
together as their \[fasting\] day. <span
id="fr_4801"></span>[4802](#fn_4801) And this variety among the
observers \[of the fasts\] had not its origin in our time, but long
before in that of our predecessors, some of whom probably, being not
very accurate in their observance of it, <span id="page_569">p.
569</span> <span id="ix.viii.iii-Page_569"></span> handed down to
posterity the custom as it had, through simplicity or private fancy,
been \[introduced among them\]. And yet nevertheless all these lived in
peace one with another, and we also keep peace together. Thus, in fact,
the difference \[in observing\] the fast establishes the harmony of
\[our common\] faith. <span id="fr_4802"></span>[4803](#fn_4802) And the
presbyters preceding Soter in the government of the Church which thou
dost now rule—I mean, Anicetus and Pius, Hyginus and Telesphorus, and
Sixtus—did neither themselves observe it \[after that fashion\], nor
permit those with them <span id="fr_4803"></span>[4804](#fn_4803) to do
so. Notwithstanding this, those who did not keep \[the feast in this
way\] were peacefully disposed towards those who came to them from other
dioceses in which it was \[so\] observed although such observance was
\[felt\] in more decided contrariety \[as presented\] to those who did
not fall in with it; and none were ever cast out \[of the Church\] for
this matter. On the contrary, those presbyters who preceded thee, and
who did not observe \[this custom\], sent the Eucharist to those of
other dioceses who did observe it. <span
id="fr_4804"></span>[4805](#fn_4804) And when the blessed Polycarp was
sojourning in Rome in the time of Anicetus, although a slight
controversy had arisen among them as to certain other points, they were
at once well inclined towards each other \[with regard to the matter in
hand\], not willing that any quarrel should arise between them upon this
head. For neither could Anicetus persuade Polycarp to forego the
observance \[in his own way\], inasmuch as these things had been always
\[so\] observed by John the disciple of our Lord, and by other apostles
with whom he had been conversant; nor, on the other hand, could Polycarp
succeed in persuading Anicetus to keep \[the observance in his way\],
for he maintained that he was bound to adhere to the usage of the
presbyters who preceded him. And in this state of affairs they held
fellowship with each other; and Anicetus conceded to Polycarp in the
Church the celebration of the Eucharist, by way of showing him respect;
so that they parted in peace one from the other, maintaining peace with
the whole Church, both those who did observe \[this custom\] and those
who did not. <span id="fr_4805"></span>[4806](#fn_4805)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_4799"></span>[568:4800](0010878.htm#fr_4799) <span
id="ix.viii.iii-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p2"></span> See pp. 31 and 312, of this volume. We
are indebted again to Eusebius for this valuable fragment from the
Epistle of Irenæus to Victor Bishop of Rome (*Hist. Eccl.*, v. 24;
copied also by Nicephorus, iv. 39). It appears to have been a synodical
epistle to the head of the Roman Church, the historian saying that it
was written by Irenæus, “in the name of (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.viii.iii-p2.1"></span>ἐκ προσώπου</span>) those brethren over
whom he ruled throughout Gaul.” Neither are these expressions to be
limited to the Church at Lyons, for the same authority records (v. 23)
that it was the testimony “of the dioceses throughout Gaul, which
Irenæus superintended” (Harvey).

<span id="fn_4800"></span>[568:4801](0010878.htm#fr_4800) <span
id="ix.viii.iii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p3"></span> According to Harvey, the early paschal
controversy resolved itself into two particulars: (*a*) as regards the
precise day on which our Lord’s resurrection should be celebrated; (*b*)
as regards the custom of the feast preceding it.

<span id="fn_4801"></span>[568:4802](0010878.htm#fr_4801) <span
id="ix.viii.iii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p4"></span> Both reading and punctuation are here
subjects of controversy. We have followed Massuet and Harvey.

<span id="fn_4802"></span>[569:4803](0010878.htm#fr_4802) <span
id="ix.viii.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p5"></span> “The observance of *a* day, though not
everywhere the same, showed unity, so far as faith in the Lord’s
resurrection was concerned.”—<span class="upper"><span
id="ix.viii.iii-p5.1"></span>Harvey</span>.

<span id="fn_4803"></span>[569:4804](0010878.htm#fr_4803) <span
id="ix.viii.iii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p6"></span> Following the reading of Rufinus, the
ordinary text has <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.viii.iii-p6.1"></span>μετ’ αὐτούς</span>, i.e., after them.

<span id="fn_4804"></span>[569:4805](0010878.htm#fr_4804) <span
id="ix.viii.iii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p7"></span> This practice was afterwards forbidden
by the Council of Laodicea \[held about <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.viii.iii-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 360\].

<span id="fn_4805"></span>[569:4806](0010878.htm#fr_4805) <span
id="ix.viii.iii-p7.2"></span>

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p8"></span> It was perhaps in reference to this
pleasing episode in the annals of the Church, that the Council of Arles,
<span class="upper"><span id="ix.viii.iii-p8.1"></span>a.d.</span> 314,
decreed that the holy Eucharist should be consecrated by any foreign
bishop present at its celebration.
