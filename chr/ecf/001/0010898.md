<span id="ix.viii.xxiii-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>“And he mounted upon his ass.” <span
id="fr_4833"></span>[4834](#fn_4833.md) The ass was the type of the body of
Christ, upon whom all men, resting from their labours, are borne as in a
chariot. For the Saviour has taken up the burden of our sins. <span
id="fr_4834"></span>[4835](#fn_4834.md) Now the angel who appeared to
Balaam was the Word Himself; and in His hand He held a sword, to
indicate the power which He had from above.
