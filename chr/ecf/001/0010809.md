### <span id="ix.vi.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—If God demands obedience from man, if He formed man, called him and placed him under laws, it was merely for man’s welfare; not that God stood in need of man, but that He graciously conferred upon man His favours in every possible manner.

<span id="ix.vi.xv-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.xv-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.xv-p1.2"></span>In the beginning, therefore, did God form
Adam, not as if He stood in need of man, but that He might have \[some
one\] upon whom to confer His benefits. For not alone antecedently to
Adam, but also before all creation, the Word glorified His Father,
remaining in Him; and was Himself glorified by the Father, as He did
Himself declare, “Father, glorify Thou Me with the glory which I had
with Thee before the world was.” <span
id="fr_3959"></span>[3960](#fn_3959) Nor did He stand in need of our
service when He ordered us to follow Him; but He thus bestowed salvation
upon ourselves. For to follow the Saviour is to be a partaker of
salvation, and to follow light is to receive light. But those who are in
light do not themselves illumine the light, but are illumined and
revealed by it: they do certainly contribute nothing to it, but,
receiving the benefit, they are illumined by the light. Thus, also,
service \[rendered\] to God does indeed profit God nothing, nor has God
need of human obedience; but He grants to those who follow and serve Him
life and incorruption and eternal glory, bestowing benefit upon those
who serve \[Him\], because they do serve Him, and on His followers,
because they do follow Him; but does not receive any benefit from them:
for He is rich, perfect, and in need of nothing. But for this reason
does God demand service from men, in order that, since He is good and
merciful, He may benefit those who continue in His service. For, as much
as God is in want of nothing, so much does man stand in need of
fellowship with God. For this is the glory of man, to continue and
remain permanently in God’s service. Wherefore also did the Lord say to
His disciples, “Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you;” <span
id="fr_3960"></span>[3961](#fn_3960) indicating that they did not
glorify Him when they followed Him; but that, in following the Son of
God, they were glorified by Him. And again, “I will, that where I am,
there they also may be, that they may behold My glory;” <span
id="fr_3961"></span>[3962](#fn_3961) not vainly boasting because of
this, but desiring that His disciples should share in His glory: of whom
Esaias also says, “I will bring thy seed from the east, and will gather
thee from the <span id="page_479">p. 479</span> <span
id="ix.vi.xv-Page_479"></span> west; and I will say to the north, Give
up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring My sons from far, and My
daughters from the ends of the earth; all, as many as have been called
in My name: for in My glory I have prepared, and formed, and made
him.” <span id="fr_3962"></span>[3963](#fn_3962) Inasmuch as then,
“wheresoever the carcase is, there shall also the eagles be gathered
together,” <span id="fr_3963"></span>[3964](#fn_3963) we do participate
in the glory of the Lord, who has both formed us, and prepared us for
this, that, when we are with Him, we may partake of His glory.

<span id="ix.vi.xv-p7"></span>2. Thus it was, too, that God formed man
at the first, because of His munificence; but chose the patriarchs for
the sake of their salvation; and prepared a people beforehand, teaching
the headstrong to follow God; and raised up prophets upon earth,
accustoming man to bear His Spirit \[within him\], and to hold communion
with God: He Himself, indeed, having need of nothing, but granting
communion with Himself to those who stood in need of it, and sketching
out, like an architect, the plan of salvation to those that pleased Him.
And He did Himself furnish guidance to those who beheld Him not in
Egypt, while to those who became unruly in the desert He promulgated a
law very suitable \[to their condition\]. Then, on the people who
entered into the good land He bestowed a noble inheritance; and He
killed the fatted calf for those converted to the Father, and presented
them with the finest robe. <span id="fr_3964"></span>[3965](#fn_3964)
Thus, in a variety of ways, He adjusted the human race to an agreement
with salvation. On this account also does John declare in the
Apocalypse, “And His voice as the sound of many waters.” <span
id="fr_3965"></span>[3966](#fn_3965) For the Spirit \[of God\] is truly
\[like\] many waters, since the Father is both rich and great. And the
Word, passing through all those \[men\], did liberally confer benefits
upon His subjects, by drawing up in writing a law adapted and applicable
to every class \[among them\].

<span id="ix.vi.xv-p10"></span>3. Thus, too, He imposed upon the
\[Jewish\] people the construction of the tabernacle, the building of
the temple, the election of the Levites, sacrifices also, and oblations,
legal monitions, and all the other service of the law. He does Himself
truly want none of these things, for He is always full of all good, and
had in Himself all the odour of kindness, and every perfume of
sweet-smelling savours, even before Moses existed. Moreover, He
instructed the people, who were prone to turn to idols, instructing them
by repeated appeals to persevere and to serve God, calling them to the
things of primary importance by means of those which were secondary;
that is, to things that are real, by means of those that are typical;
and by things temporal, to eternal; and by the carnal to the spiritual;
and by the earthly to the heavenly; as was also said to Moses, “Thou
shalt make all things after the pattern of those things which thou
sawest in the mount.” <span id="fr_3966"></span>[3967](#fn_3966) For
during forty days He was learning to keep \[in his memory\] the words of
God, and the celestial patterns, and the spiritual images, and the types
of things to come; as also Paul says: “For they drank of the rock which
followed them: and the rock was Christ.” <span
id="fr_3967"></span>[3968](#fn_3967) And again, having first mentioned
what are contained in the law, he goes on to say: “Now all these things
happened to them in a figure; but they were written for our admonition,
upon whom the end of the ages is come.” For by means of types they
learned to fear God, and to continue devoted to His service.
