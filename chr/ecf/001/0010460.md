### <span id="viii.iii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Conclusion.

<span id="viii.iii.xv-p1"></span><span id="viii.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>And
I despised the wicked and deceitful doctrine of Simon <span
id="fr_1945"></span>[1946](#fn_1945.md) of my own nation. And if you give
this book your authority, we will expose him before all, that, if
possible, they may be converted. For this end alone did we compose this
treatise. <span id="viii.iii.xv-p2.1"></span>And our doctrines are not
shameful, according to a sober judgment, but are indeed more lofty than
all human philosophy: and if not so, they are at least unlike the
doctrines of the Sotadists, and Philænidians, and Dancers, and
Epicureans, and such other teachings of the poets, which all are allowed
to acquaint themselves with both as acted and as written. And henceforth
we shall be silent, having done as much as we could, and having added
the prayer that all men everywhere may be counted worthy of the truth.
And would that you also, in a manner becoming piety and
philosophy, <span id="fr_1946"></span>[1947](#fn_1946.md) would for your
own sakes judge justly!

<span id="viii.iii.xv-p2"></span> \[Simon Magus appears to be one with
whom Justin is perfectly familiar, and hence we are not to conclude
rashly that he blundered as to the divine honours rendered to him as the
Sabine God.\]

thrust for “Pius the philosopher” and the emperor.\]
