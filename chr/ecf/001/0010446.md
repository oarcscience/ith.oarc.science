### <span id="viii.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Introduction.

<span id="viii.iii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.iii.i-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iii.i-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.iii.i-p1.3"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="viii.iii.i-p1.4"></span>Romans</span>, the
things which have recently <span id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921.md)
happened in your city under Urbicus, <span
id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922.md) and the things which are likewise
being everywhere unreasonably done by the governors, have compelled me
to frame this composition for your sakes, who are men of like passions,
and brethren, though ye know it not, and though ye be unwilling to
acknowledge it on account of your glorying in what you esteem
dignities. <span id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923.md) For everywhere,
whoever is corrected by father, or neighbour, or child, or friend, or
brother, or husband, or wife, for a fault, for being hard to move, for
loving pleasure and being hard to urge to what is right (except those
who have been persuaded that the unjust and intemperate shall be
punished in eternal fire, but that the virtuous and those who lived like
Christ shall dwell with God in a state that is free from suffering,—we
mean, those who have become Christians), and the evil demons, who hate
us, and who keep such men as these subject to themselves, and serving
them in the capacity of judges, incite them, as rulers actuated by evil
spirits, to put us to death. But that the cause of all that has taken
place under Urbicus may become quite plain to you, I will relate what
has been done.
