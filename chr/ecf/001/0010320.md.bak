### <span id="v.xxi.i-p0.1"></span>His friend <span id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386.md) Ignatius to John the holy presbyter.

<span id="v.xxi.i-p2"></span><span id="v.xxi.i-p2.1"></span><span
id="v.xxi.i-p2.2"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.xxi.i-p2.3"></span>If</span> thou wilt give me leave, I desire to
go up to Jerusalem, and see the faithful <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387.md) saints who are there, especially
Mary the mother, whom they report to be an object of admiration and of
affection to all. For who would not rejoice to behold and to address her
who bore the true God from her <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388.md) own womb, provided he is a friend
of our faith and religion? And in like manner \[I desire to see\] the
venerable James, who is surnamed Just, whom they relate to be very like
Christ Jesus in appearance, <span id="fr_1389"></span>[1390](#fn_1389.md)
in life, and in method of conduct, as if he were a twin-brother of the
same womb. They say that, if I see him, I see also Jesus Himself, as to
all the features and aspect of His body. Moreover, \[I desire to see\]
the other saints, both male and female. Alas! why do I delay? Why am I
kept back? Kind <span id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390.md) teacher, bid
me hasten \[to fulfil my wish\], and fare thou well. Amen.
