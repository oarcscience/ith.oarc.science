### <span id="v.vi.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Have but one Eucharist, etc.

<span id="v.vi.iv-p1"></span><span id="v.vi.iv-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.vi.iv-p1.2"></span><span id="v.vi.iv-p1.3"></span><span
id="v.vi.iv-p1.4"></span>Take ye heed, then, to have but one Eucharist.
For there is one flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup to \[show
forth <span id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903) \] the unity of His blood;
one altar; as there is one bishop, along with the presbytery and
deacons, my fellow-servants: that so, whatsoever ye do, ye may do it
according to \[the will of\] God.

<span id="v.vi.iv-p3"></span><span id="v.vi.iv-p3.1"></span>I have
confidence of you in the Lord, that ye will be of no other mind. <span
id="v.vi.iv-p3.2"></span><span id="v.vi.iv-p3.3"></span><span
id="v.vi.iv-p3.4"></span>Wherefore I write boldly to your love, which is
worthy of God, and exhort you to have but one faith, and one \[kind of\]
preaching, and one Eucharist. For there is one flesh of the Lord Jesus
Christ; and His blood which was shed for us is one; one loaf also is
broken to all \[the communicants\], and one cup is distributed among
them all: there is but one altar for the whole Church, and one bishop,
with the presbytery and deacons, my fellow-servants. <span
id="v.vi.iv-p3.5"></span><span id="v.vi.iv-p3.6"></span><span
id="v.vi.iv-p3.7"></span>Since, also, there is but one unbegotten Being,
God, even the Father; and one only-begotten Son, God, the Word and man;
and one Comforter, the Spirit of truth; and also one preaching, and one
faith, and one baptism; <span id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904) and one
Church which the holy apostles established from one end of the earth to
the other by the blood of Christ, and by their own sweat and toil; it
behoves you also, therefore, as “a peculiar people, and a holy
nation,” <span id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905) to perform all things
with harmony in Christ. <span id="v.vi.iv-p5.3"></span><span
id="v.vi.iv-p5.4"></span>Wives, be ye subject to your husbands in the
fear of God; <span id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906) and ye virgins, to
Christ in purity, not counting marriage an abomination, but desiring
that which is better, not for the reproach of wedlock, but for the sake
of meditating on the law. Children, obey your parents, and have an
affection for them, as workers together with God for your birth \[into
the world\]. Servants, be subject to your masters in God, that ye may be
the freed-men of Christ. <span id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907)
Husbands, love your wives, as fellow-servants of God, as your own body,
as the partners of your life, and your co-adjutors in the procreation of
children. <span id="v.vi.iv-p7.2"></span>Virgins, have Christ alone
before your eyes, and His Father in your prayers, being enlightened by
the Spirit. May I have pleasure in your purity, as that of Elijah, or as
of Joshua the son of Nun, as of Melchizedek, or as of Elisha, as of
Jeremiah, or as of John the Baptist, as of the beloved disciple, as of
Timothy, as of Titus, as of Evodius, as of Clement, who departed this
life in \[perfect\] chastity, <span id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908)
<span id="v.vi.iv-p8.1"></span>Not, however, that I blame the other
blessed \[saints\] because they entered into the married state, of which
I have just spoken. <span id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909) For I pray
that, being found worthy of God, I may be found at their feet in the
kingdom, as at the feet of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; as of Joseph,
and Isaiah, and the rest of the prophets; as of Peter, and Paul, and the
rest of the apostles, that were married men. For they entered into these
marriages not for the sake of appetite, but out of regard for the
propagation of mankind. <span id="v.vi.iv-p9.1"></span>Fathers, “bring
up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord;” <span
id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910) and teach them the holy Scriptures,
and also trades, that they may not indulge in idleness. Now \[the
Scripture\] says, “A righteous father educates \[his children\] well;
his heart shall rejoice in a wise son.” <span
id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911) Masters, be gentle towards your
servants, as holy Job has taught you; <span
id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912) for there is one nature, and one
family of mankind. For “in Christ there is neither bond nor free.” <span
id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913) <span id="v.vi.iv-p13.2"></span>Let
governors be obedient to Cæsar; soldiers to those that command them;
deacons to the presbyters, as to high-priests; the presbyters, and
deacons, and the rest of the clergy, together with all the people, and
the soldiers, and the governors, and Cæsar \[himself\], to the bishop;
the bishop to Christ, even as Christ to the Father. And thus unity is
preserved throughout. <span id="v.vi.iv-p13.3"></span>Let not the widows
be wanderers about, nor fond of dainties, nor gadders from house to
house; but let them be like Judith, noted for her seriousness; and like
Anna, eminent for her sobriety. I do not ordain these things as an
apostle: for “who am I, or what is my father’s house,” <span
id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914) that I should pretend to be equal in
honour to them? But as your “fellow-soldier,” <span
id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915) I hold the position of one who
\[simply\] admonishes you.
