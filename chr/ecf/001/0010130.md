### <span id="v.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Beware of false teachers.

<span id="v.ii.vii-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.vii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.vii-p1.2"></span>For some are in the habit of carrying about
the name \[of Jesus Christ\] in wicked guile, while yet they practise
things unworthy of God, whom ye must flee as ye would wild beasts. For
they are ravening dogs, who bite secretly, against whom ye must be on
your guard, inasmuch as they are men who can scarcely be cured. <span
id="v.ii.vii-p1.3"></span>There is one Physician who is possessed both
of flesh and spirit; both made and not made; God existing in flesh; true
life in death; both of Mary and of God; first passible and then
impassible,— <span id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533) even Jesus Christ
our Lord.

<span id="v.ii.vii-p3"></span><span id="v.ii.vii-p3.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.vii-p3.2"></span>But some most worthless persons are in the
habit of carrying about the name \[of Jesus Christ\] in wicked guile,
while yet they practise things unworthy of God, and hold opinions
contrary to the doctrine of Christ, to their own destruction, and that
of those who give credit to them, whom you must avoid as ye would wild
beasts. For “the righteous man who avoids them is saved for ever; but
the destruction of the ungodly is sudden, and a subject of
rejoicing.” <span id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534) For “they are dumb
dogs, that cannot bark,” <span id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535) raving
mad, and biting secretly, against whom ye must be on your guard, since
they labour under an incurable disease. <span
id="v.ii.vii-p5.2"></span>But our Physician is the only true God, the
unbegotten and unapproachable, the Lord of all, the Father and Begetter
of the only-begotten Son. We have also as a Physician the Lord our God,
Jesus the Christ, the only-begotten Son and Word, before time
began, <span id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536) but who afterwards became
also man, of Mary the virgin. For “the Word was made flesh.” <span
id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537) Being incorporeal, He was in the body;
being impassible, He was in a passible body; being immortal, He was in a
mortal body; being life, He became subject to corruption, that He might
free our souls from death and corruption, and heal them, and might
restore them to health, when they were diseased with ungodliness and
wicked lusts.
