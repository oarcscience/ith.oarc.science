id="v.iv.i-p1.2"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.iv.i-p1.3"></span>I know</span> that ye possess an unblameable and
sincere mind in patience, and that not only in present practice, <span
id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md) but according to inherent nature, as
Polybius your bishop has shown me, who has come to Smyrna by the will of
God and Jesus Christ, and so sympathized in the joy which I, who am
bound in Christ Jesus, possess, that I beheld your whole multitude in
him. <span id="v.iv.i-p2.1"></span>Having therefore received through him
the testimony of your good-will, according to God, I gloried to find
you, as I knew you were, the followers of God.

id="v.iv.i-p3.2"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.iv.i-p3.3"></span>I know</span> that ye possess an unblameable and
sincere mind in patience, and that not only for present use, <span
id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md) but as a permanent possession, as
Polybius your bishop has shown me, who has come to Smyrna by the will of
God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, with the
co-operation of the Spirit, and so sympathized in the joy which I, who
am bound in Christ Jesus, possess, that I beheld your whole multitude in
Him. <span id="v.iv.i-p4.1"></span>Having therefore received through him
the testimony of your good-will according to God, I gloried to find that
you were the followers of Jesus Christ the Saviour.
