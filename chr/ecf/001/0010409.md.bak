### <span id="viii.ii.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—Different modes of prophecy.

<span id="viii.ii.xxxvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>But when you hear the utterances of the
prophets spoken as it were personally, you must not suppose that they
are spoken by the inspired themselves, but by the Divine Word who moves
them. For sometimes He declares things that are to come to pass, in the
manner of one who foretells the future; sometimes He speaks as from the
person of God the Lord and Father of all; sometimes as from the person
of Christ; sometimes as from the person of the people answering the Lord
or His Father, just as you can see even in your own writers, one man
being the writer of the whole, but introducing the persons who converse.

this the Jews who possessed the books of the prophets did not
understand, and therefore did not recognise Christ even when He came,
but even hate us who say that He has come, and who prove that, as was
predicted, He was crucified by them.
