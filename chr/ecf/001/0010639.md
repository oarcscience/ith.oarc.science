### <span id="viii.vi.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Origin of Plato’s doctrine of form.

<span id="viii.vi.xxix-p1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xxix-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.vi.xxix-p1.2"></span>And
Plato, too, when he says that form is the third original principle next
to God and matter, has manifestly received this suggestion from no other
source than from Moses, having learned, indeed, from the words of Moses
the name of form, but not having at the same time been instructed by the
initiated, that without mystic insight it is impossible to have any
distinct knowledge of the writings of Moses. For Moses wrote that God
had spoken to him regarding the tabernacle in the following words: “And
thou shalt make for me according to all that I show thee in the mount,
the pattern of the tabernacle.” <span
id="fr_2573"></span>[2574](#fn_2573.md) And again: “And thou shalt erect
the tabernacle <span id="page_286">p. 286</span> <span
id="viii.vi.xxix-Page_286"></span> according to the pattern of all the
instruments thereof, even so shalt thou make it.” <span
id="fr_2574"></span>[2575](#fn_2574.md) And again, a little afterwards:
“Thus then thou shalt make it according to the pattern which was showed
to thee in the mount.” <span id="fr_2575"></span>[2576](#fn_2575.md) Plato,
then, reading these passages, and not receiving what was written with
the suitable insight, thought that form had some kind of separate
existence before that which the senses perceive, and he often calls it
the pattern of the things which are made, since the writing of Moses
spoke thus of the tabernacle: “According to the form showed to thee in
the mount, so shalt thou make it.”
