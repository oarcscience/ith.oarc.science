### <span id="v.xviii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Youth may be allied with piety and discretion.

<span id="v.xviii.iii-p1"></span>But as to those whom we have named
being young men, do not, thou blessed one, have any apprehension. For I
would have you know that they are wise about the flesh, and are
insensible to its passions, they themselves glowing with all the glory
of a hoary head through their own <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[1361](#fn_1360) intrinsic merits, and though but
recently called as young men to the priesthood. <span
id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361) Now, call thou into exercise <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362) thy thoughts through the Spirit
that God has given to thee by Christ, and thou wilt remember <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363) that Samuel, while yet a little
child, was called a seer, and was reckoned in the company of the
prophets, that he reproved the aged Eli for transgression, since he had
honoured his infatuated sons above God the author of all things, and had
allowed them to go unpunished, when they turned the office of the
priesthood into ridicule, and acted violently towards thy people.
