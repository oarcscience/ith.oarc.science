### <span id="ix.vii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Proofs of the resurrection from Isaiah and Ezekiel; the same God who created us will also raise us up.

<span id="ix.vii.xvi-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Now, that He who at the beginning created
man, did promise him a second birth after his dissolution into earth,
Esaias thus declares: “The dead shall rise again, and they who are in
the tombs shall arise, and they who are in the earth shall rejoice. For
the dew which is from Thee is health to them.” <span
id="fr_4574"></span>[4575](#fn_4574.md) And again: “I will comfort you, and
ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem: and ye shall see, and your heart
shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish as the grass; and the hand
of the Lord shall be known to those who worship Him.” <span
id="fr_4575"></span>[4576](#fn_4575.md) And Ezekiel speaks as follows: “And
the hand of the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xvi-p3.2"></span>Lord</span> came upon me, and the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vii.xvi-p3.3"></span>Lord</span> led me forth
in the Spirit, and set me down in the midst of the plain, and this place
was full of bones. And He caused me to pass by them round about: and,
behold, there were many upon the surface of the plain very dry. And He
said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I said, Lord, Thou
who hast made them dost know. And He said unto me, Prophesy upon these
bones, and thou shalt say to them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of the
<span class="upper"><span id="ix.vii.xvi-p3.4"></span>Lord</span>. Thus
saith the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xvi-p3.5"></span>Lord</span> to these bones, Behold, I will
cause the spirit of life to come upon you, and I will lay sinews upon
you, and bring up flesh again upon you, and I will stretch skin upon
you, and will put my Spirit into you, and ye shall live; and ye shall
know that I am the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xvi-p3.6"></span>Lord</span>. And I prophesied as the Lord
had commanded me. And it came to pass, when I was prophesying, that,
behold, an earthquake, and the bones were drawn together, each one to
its own articulation: and I beheld, and, lo, the sinews and flesh were
produced upon them, and the skins rose upon them round about, but there
was no breath in them. And He said unto me, Prophesy to the breath, son
of man, and say to the breath, These things saith the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vii.xvi-p3.7"></span>Lord</span>, Come from
the four winds (*spiritibus*), and breathe upon these dead, that they
may live. So I prophesied as the Lord had commanded me, and the breath
entered into them; and they did live, and stood upon their feet, an
exceeding great gathering.” <span id="fr_4576"></span>[4577](#fn_4576.md)
And again he says, “Thus saith the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xvi-p4.2"></span>Lord</span>, Behold, I will set your graves
open, and cause you to come out of your graves, and bring you into the
land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vii.xvi-p4.3"></span>Lord</span>, <span
id="page_543">p. 543</span> <span id="ix.vii.xvi-Page_543"></span> when
I shall open your sepulchres, that I may bring my people again out of
the sepulchres: and I will put my Spirit into you, and ye shall live;
and I will place you in your land, and ye shall know that I am the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vii.xvi-p4.4"></span>Lord</span>. I have
said, and I will do, saith the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xvi-p4.5"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_4577"></span>[4578](#fn_4577.md) As we at once perceive that the
Creator (*Demiurgo*) is in this passage represented as vivifying our
dead bodies, and promising resurrection to them, and resuscitation from
their sepulchres and tombs, conferring upon them immortality also (He
says, “For as the tree of life, so shall their days be” <span
id="fr_4578"></span>[4579](#fn_4578) .md), He is shown to be the only God
who accomplishes these things, and as Himself the good Father,
benevolently conferring life upon those who have not life from
themselves.

<span id="ix.vii.xvi-p7"></span>2. And for this reason did the Lord most
plainly manifest Himself and the Father to His disciples, lest,
forsooth, they might seek after another God besides Him who formed man,
and who gave him the breath of life; and that men might not rise to such
a pitch of madness as to feign another Father above the Creator. And
thus also He healed by a word all the others who were in a weakly
condition because of sin; to whom also He said, “Behold, thou art made
whole, sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon thee:” <span
id="fr_4579"></span>[4580](#fn_4579.md) pointing out by this, that, because
of the sin of disobedience, infirmities have come upon men. To that man,
however, who had been blind from his birth, He gave sight, not by means
of a word, but by an outward action; doing this not without a purpose,
or because it so happened, but that He might show forth the hand of God,
that which at the beginning had moulded man. And therefore, when His
disciples asked Him for what cause the man had been born blind, whether
for his own or his parents’ fault, He replied, “Neither hath this man
sinned, nor his parents, but that the works of God should be made
manifest in him.” <span id="fr_4580"></span>[4581](#fn_4580.md) Now the
work of God is the fashioning of man. For, as the Scripture says, He
made \[man\] by a kind of process: “And the Lord took clay from the
earth, and formed man.” <span id="fr_4581"></span>[4582](#fn_4581.md)
Wherefore also the Lord spat on the ground and made clay, and smeared it
upon the eyes, pointing out the original fashioning \[of man\], how it
was effected, and manifesting the hand of God to those who can
understand by what \[hand\] man was formed out of the dust. For that
which the artificer, the Word, had omitted to form in the womb, \[viz.,
the blind man’s eyes\], He then supplied in public, that the works of
God might be manifested in him, in order that we might not be seeking
out another hand by which man was fashioned, nor another Father; knowing
that this hand of God which formed us at the beginning, and which does
form us in the womb, has in the last times sought us out who were lost,
winning back His own, and taking up the lost sheep upon His shoulders,
and with joy restoring it to the fold of life.

<span id="ix.vii.xvi-p11"></span>3. Now, that the Word of God forms us
in the womb, He says to Jeremiah, “Before I formed thee in the womb, I
knew thee; and before thou wentest forth from the belly, I sanctified
thee, and appointed thee a prophet among the nations.” <span
id="fr_4582"></span>[4583](#fn_4582.md) And Paul, too, says in like manner,
“But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, that I
might declare Him among the nations.” <span
id="fr_4583"></span>[4584](#fn_4583.md) As, therefore, we are by the Word
formed in the womb, this very same Word formed the visual power in him
who had been blind from his birth; showing openly who it is that
fashions us in secret, since the Word Himself had been made manifest to
men: and declaring the original formation of Adam, and the manner in
which he was created, and by what hand he was fashioned, indicating the
whole from a part. For the Lord who formed the visual powers is He who
made the whole man, carrying out the will of the Father. And inasmuch as
man, with respect to that formation which, was after Adam, having fallen
into transgression, needed the laver of regeneration, \[the Lord\] said
to him \[upon whom He had conferred sight\], after He had smeared his
eyes with the clay, “Go to Siloam, and wash;” <span
id="fr_4584"></span>[4585](#fn_4584.md) thus restoring to him both \[his
perfect\] confirmation, and that regeneration which takes place by means
of the laver. And for this reason when he was washed he came seeing,
that he might both know Him who had fashioned him, and that man might
learn \[to know\] Him who has conferred upon him life.

<span id="ix.vii.xvi-p15"></span>4. All the followers of Valentinus,
therefore, lose their case, when they say that man was not fashioned out
of this earth, but from a fluid and diffused substance. For, from the
earth out of which the Lord formed eyes for that man, from the same
earth it is evident that man was also fashioned at the beginning. For it
were incompatible that the eyes should indeed be formed from one source
and the rest of the body from another; as neither would it be compatible
that one \[being\] fashioned the body, and another the eyes. But He, the
very same who formed Adam at the beginning, with whom also the Father
spake, \[saying\], “Let Us make man after Our image and likeness,” <span
id="fr_4585"></span>[4586](#fn_4585.md) revealing Himself in these last
times to men, formed visual organs (*visionem*) for him who had been
blind \[in <span id="page_544">p. 544</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xvi-Page_544"></span> that body which he had derived\] from
Adam. Wherefore also the Scripture, pointing out what should come to
pass, says, that when Adam had hid himself because of his disobedience,
the Lord came to him at eventide, called him forth, and said, “Where art
thou?” <span id="fr_4586"></span>[4587](#fn_4586.md) That means that in the
last times the very same Word of God came to call man, reminding him of
his doings, living in which he had been hidden from the Lord. For just
as at that time God spake to Adam at eventide, searching him out; so in
the last times, by means of the same voice, searching out his posterity,
He has visited them.
