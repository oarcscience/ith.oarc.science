### <span id="viii.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Names of God and of Christ, their meaning and power.

<span id="viii.iii.vi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iii.vi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iii.vi-p1.2"></span>But to
the Father of all, who is unbegotten there is no name given. For by
whatever name He be called, He has as His elder the person who gives Him
the name. But these words Father, and God, and Creator, and Lord, and
Master, are not names, but appellations derived from His good deeds and
functions. <span id="viii.iii.vi-p1.3"></span><span
id="viii.iii.vi-p1.4"></span><span id="viii.iii.vi-p1.5"></span><span
id="viii.iii.vi-p1.6"></span><span id="viii.iii.vi-p1.7"></span>And His
Son, who alone is properly called Son, the Word who also was with Him
and was begotten before the works, when at first He created and arranged
all things by Him, is called Christ, in reference to His being anointed
and God’s ordering all things through Him; this name itself also
containing an unknown significance; as also the appellation “God” is not
a name, but an opinion implanted in the nature of men of a thing that
can hardly be explained. But “Jesus,” His name as man and Saviour, has
also significance. For He was made man also, as we before said, having
been conceived according to the will of God the Father, for the sake of
believing men, and for the destruction of the demons. And now you can
learn this from what is under your own observation. For numberless
demoniacs throughout the whole world, and in your city, many of our
Christian men exorcising them in the name of Jesus Christ, who was
crucified under Pontius Pilate, have healed and do heal, rendering
helpless and driving the possessing devils out of the men, though they
could not be cured by all the other exorcists, and those who used
incantations and drugs.
