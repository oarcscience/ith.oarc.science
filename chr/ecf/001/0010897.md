He does not hint at anything with regard to the people, for they all lay
before his view, but \[he refers\] to the mystery of Christ pointed out
beforehand. For as He was to be born of the fathers according to the
flesh, the Spirit gives instructions to the man (Balaam) beforehand,
lest, going forth in ignorance, he might pronounce a curse upon the
people. <span id="fr_4832"></span>[4833](#fn_4832) Not, indeed, that
\[his curse\] could take any effect contrary to the will of God; but
\[this was done\] as an exhibition of the providence of God which He
exercised towards them on account of their forefathers.
