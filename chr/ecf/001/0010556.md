### <span id="viii.iv.xcv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XCV.—Christ took upon Himself the curse due to us.

<span id="viii.iv.xcv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xcv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xcv-p1.2"></span>“For the
whole human race will be found to be under a curse. For it is written in
the law of Moses, ‘Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things
that are written in the book of the law to do them.’ <span
id="fr_2314"></span>[2315](#fn_2314.md) And no one has accurately done all,
nor will you venture to deny this; but some more and some less than
others have observed the ordinances enjoined. But if those who are under
this law appear to be under a curse for not having observed all the
requirements, how much more shall all the nations appear to be under a
curse who practise idolatry, who seduce youths, and commit other crimes?
If, then, the Father of all wished His Christ for the whole human family
to take upon Him the curses of all, knowing that, after He had been
crucified and was dead, He would raise Him up, why do you argue about
Him, who submitted to suffer these things according to the Father’s
will, as if He were accursed, and do not rather bewail yourselves? For
although His Father caused Him to suffer these things in behalf of the
human family, yet you did not commit the deed as in obedience to the
will of God. For you did not practise piety when you slew the prophets.
And let none of you say: If His Father wished Him to suffer this, in
order that by His stripes the human race might be healed, we have done
no wrong. If, indeed, you repent of your sins, and recognise Him to be
Christ, and observe His commandments, then you may assert this; for, as
I have said before, remission of sins shall be yours. But if you curse
Him and them that believe on Him, and, when you have the power, put them
to death, how is it possible that requisition shall not be made of you,
as of unrighteous and sinful men, altogether hard-hearted and without
understanding, because you laid your hands on Him?
