### <span id="viii.ii.lix-p0.1"></span>Chapter LIX.—Plato’s obligation to Moses.

id="viii.ii.lix-p1.3"></span>And that you may learn that it was from our
teachers—we mean the account given through the prophets— that Plato
borrowed his statement that God, having altered matter which was
shapeless, made the world, hear the very words spoken through Moses,
who, as above shown, was the first prophet, and of greater antiquity
than the Greek writers; and through whom the Spirit of prophecy,
signifying how and from what materials God at first formed the world,
spake thus: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And
the earth was invisible and unfurnished, and darkness was upon the face
of the deep; and the Spirit of God moved over the waters. And God said,
Let there be light; and it was so.” So that both Plato and they who
agree with him, and we ourselves, have learned, and you also can be
convinced, that by the word of God the whole world was made out of the
substance spoken of before by Moses. And that which the poets call
Erebus, we know was spoken of formerly by Moses. <span
