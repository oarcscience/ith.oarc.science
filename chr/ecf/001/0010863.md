### <span id="ix.vii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—The fraud, pride, and tyrannical kingdom of Antichrist, as described by Daniel and Paul.

<span id="ix.vii.xxvi-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>And not only by the particulars already
mentioned, but also by means of the events which shall occur in the time
of Antichrist is it shown that he, being an apostate and a robber, is
anxious to be adored as God; and that, although a mere slave, he wishes
himself to be proclaimed as a king. For he (Antichrist) being endued
with all the power of the devil, shall come, not as a righteous king,
nor as a legitimate king, \[i.e., one\] in subjection to God, but an
impious, unjust, and lawless one; as an apostate, iniquitous and
murderous; as a robber, concentrating in himself \[all\] satanic
apostasy, and setting aside idols to persuade \[men\] that he himself is
God, raising up himself as the only idol, having in himself the
multifarious errors of the other idols. This he does, in order that they
who do \[now\] worship the devil by means of many abominations, may
serve himself by this one idol, of whom the apostle thus speaks in the
second Epistle to the Thessalonians: “Unless there shall come a failing
away first, and the man of sin shall be revealed, the son of perdition,
who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that
is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself
as if he were God.” The apostle therefore clearly points out his
apostasy, and that he is lifted up above all that is called God, or that
is worshipped—that is, above every idol —for these are indeed so called
by men, but are not \[really\] gods; and that he will endeavour in a
tyrannical manner to set himself forth as God.

<span id="ix.vii.xxvi-p2"></span>2. Moreover, he (the apostle) has also
pointed out this which I have shown in many ways, that the temple in
Jerusalem was made by the direction of the true God. For the apostle
himself, speaking in his own person, distinctly called it the temple of
God. Now I have shown in the third book, that no one is termed God by
the apostles when speaking for themselves, except Him who truly is God,
the Father of our Lord, by whose directions the temple which is at
Jerusalem was constructed for those purposes which I have already
mentioned; in which \[temple\] the enemy shall sit, endeavouring to show
himself as Christ, as the Lord also declares: “But when ye shall see the
abomination of desolation, which has been spoken of by Daniel the
prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that readeth understand),
then let those who are in Judea flee into the mountains; and he who is
upon the house-top, let him not come down to take anything out of his
house: for there shall then be great hardship, such as has not been from
the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall be.” <span
id="fr_4663"></span>[4664](#fn_4663.md)

<span id="ix.vii.xxvi-p4"></span>3. Daniel too, looking forward to the
end of the last kingdom, i.e., the ten last kings, amongst whom the
kingdom of those men shall be partitioned, and upon whom the son of
perdition shall come, declares that ten horns shall spring from the
beast, and that another little horn shall arise in the midst of them,
and that three of the former shall be rooted up before his face. He
says: “And, behold, eyes were in this horn as the eyes of a man, and a
mouth speaking great things, and his look was more stout than his
fellows. I was looking, and this horn made war against the saints, and
prevailed against them, until the Ancient of days came and gave judgment
to the saints of the most high God, and the time came, and the saints
obtained the kingdom.” <span id="fr_4664"></span>[4665](#fn_4664.md) Then,
further on, in the interpretation of the vision, there was said to him:
“The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall
excel all other kingdoms, and devour the whole earth, and tread it down,
and cut it in pieces. And its ten horns are ten kings which shall arise;
and after them shall arise another, who shall surpass in evil deeds all
that were before <span id="page_554">p. 554</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xxvi-Page_554"></span> him, and shall overthrow three kings;
and he shall speak words against the most high God, and wear out the
saints of the most high God, and shall purpose to change times and laws;
and \[everything\] shall be given into his hand until a time of times
and a half time,” <span id="fr_4665"></span>[4666](#fn_4665.md) that is,
for three years and six months, during which time, when he comes, he
shall reign over the earth. Of whom also the Apostle Paul again,
speaking in the second \[Epistle\] to the Thessalonians, and at the same
time proclaiming the cause of his advent, thus says: “And then shall the
wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the spirit
of His mouth, and destroy by the presence of His coming; whose coming
\[i.e., the wicked one’s\] is after the working of Satan, in all power,
and signs, and portents of lies, and with all deceivableness of
wickedness for those who perish; because they did not receive the love
of the truth, that they might be saved. And therefore God will send them
the working of error, that they may believe a lie; that they all may be
judged who did not believe the truth, but gave consent to
iniquity,” <span id="fr_4666"></span>[4667](#fn_4666.md)

<span id="ix.vii.xxvi-p8"></span>4. The Lord also spoke as follows to
those who did not believe in Him: “I have come in my Father’s name, and
ye have not received Me: when another shall come in his own name, him ye
will receive,” <span id="fr_4667"></span>[4668](#fn_4667.md) calling
Antichrist “the other,” because he is alienated from the Lord. This is
also the unjust judge, whom the Lord mentioned as one “who feared not
God, neither regarded man,” <span id="fr_4668"></span>[4669](#fn_4668.md)
to whom the widow fled in her forgetfulness of God,—that is, the earthly
Jerusalem,—to be avenged of her adversary. Which also he shall do in the
time of his kingdom: he shall remove his kingdom into that \[city\], and
shall sit in the temple of God, leading astray those who worship him, as
if he were Christ. To this purpose Daniel says again: “And he shall
desolate the holy place; and sin has been given for a sacrifice, <span
id="fr_4669"></span>[4670](#fn_4669.md) and righteousness been cast away in
the earth, and he has been active (*fecit*), and gone on
prosperously.” <span id="fr_4670"></span>[4671](#fn_4670.md) And the angel
Gabriel, when explaining his vision, states with regard to this person:
“And towards the end of their kingdom a king of a most fierce
countenance shall arise, one understanding \[dark\] questions, and
exceedingly powerful, full of wonders; and he shall corrupt, direct,
influence (*faciet*), and put strong men down, the holy people likewise;
and his yoke shall be directed as a wreath \[round their neck\]; deceit
shall be in his hand, and he shall be lifted up in his heart: he shall
also ruin many by deceit, and lead many to perdition, bruising them in
his hand like eggs.” <span id="fr_4671"></span>[4672](#fn_4671.md) And then
he points out the time that his tyranny shall last, during which the
saints shall be put to flight, they who offer a pure sacrifice unto God:
“And in the midst of the week,” he says, “the sacrifice and the libation
shall be taken away, and the abomination of desolation \[shall be
brought\] into the temple: even unto the consummation of the time shall
the desolation be complete.” <span id="fr_4672"></span>[4673](#fn_4672.md)
Now three years and six months constitute the half-week.

<span id="ix.vii.xxvi-p15"></span>5. From all these passages are
revealed to us, not merely the particulars of the apostasy, and \[the
doings\] of him who concentrates in himself every satanic error, but
also, that there is one and the same God the Father, who was declared by
the prophets, but made manifest by Christ. For if what Daniel prophesied
concerning the end has been confirmed by the Lord, when He said, “When
ye shall see the abomination of desolation, which has been spoken of by
Daniel the prophet” <span id="fr_4673"></span>[4674](#fn_4673.md) (and the
angel Gabriel gave the interpretation of the visions to Daniel, and he
is the archangel of the Creator (*Demiurgi*), who also proclaimed to
Mary the visible coming and the incarnation of Christ), then one and the
same God is most manifestly pointed out, who sent the prophets, and made
promise <span id="fr_4674"></span>[4675](#fn_4674.md) of the Son, and
called us into His knowledge.
