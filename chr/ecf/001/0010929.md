<span id="ix.viii.liv-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.liv-p1.1"></span>The <span
id="fr_4911"></span>[4912](#fn_4911.md) law and the prophets and
evangelists have declared that Christ was born of a virgin, and suffered
on the cross; was raised also from the dead, and taken up to heaven;
that He was glorified, and reigns for ever. He is Himself termed the
Perfect Intellect, the Word of God. He is the First-begotten, <span
id="fr_4912"></span>[4913](#fn_4912.md) after a transcendent manner, the
Creator of man; All in all; Patriarch among the patriarchs; Law in the
law; the Priest among priests; among kings Prime Leader; the Prophet
among the prophets; the Angel among angels; the Man among men; Son in
the Father; God in God; King to all eternity. He was sold with Joseph,
and He guided Abraham; was bound along with Isaac, and wandered with
Jacob; with Moses He was Leader, and, respecting the people, Legislator.
He preached in the prophets; was incarnate of a virgin; born in
Bethlehem; received by John, and baptized in Jordan; was tempted in the
desert, and proved to be the Lord. He gathered the apostles together,
and preached the kingdom of heaven; gave light to the blind, and raised
the dead; was seen in the temple, but was not held by the people as
worthy of credit; was arrested by the priests, conducted before Herod,
and condemned in the presence of Pilate; He manifested Himself in the
body, was suspended upon a beam of wood, and raised from the dead; shown
to the apostles, and, having been carried up to heaven, sitteth on the
right hand of the Father, and has been glorified by Him as the
Resurrection of the dead. Moreover, He is the Salvation of the lost, the
Light to those dwelling in darkness, and Redemption to those who have
been born; the Shepherd of the saved, and the Bridegroom of the Church;
the Charioteer of the cherubim, the Leader of the angelic host; God of
God; Jesus Christ our Saviour.

the Armenian copy: “From St. Irenæus, bishop, follower of the apostles,
on the Lord’s resurrection.”

have adopted the conjectural emendation of Quatremere.
