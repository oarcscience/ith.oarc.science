### <span id="v.xii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="v.xii.iv-p1"></span>I write to all the Churches, and declare
to all men, that I willingly die for the sake of God, if so be that ye
hinder me not. I entreat of you not to be \[affected\] towards me with a
love which is unseasonable. Leave me to become \[the prey of\] the
beasts, that by their means I may be accounted worthy of God. I am the
wheat of God, and by the teeth of the beasts I shall be ground, <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162.md) that I may be found the pure bread
of God. Provoke ye greatly <span id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163.md)
the wild beasts, that they may be for me a grave, and may leave nothing
of my body, in order that, when I have fallen asleep, I may not be a
burden upon any one. Then shall I be in truth a disciple of Jesus
Christ, when the world seeth not even my body. Entreat of our Lord in my
behalf, that through these instruments I may be found a sacrifice to
God. I do not, like Peter and Paul, issue orders unto you. They
are <span id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164.md) apostles, but I am one
condemned; they indeed are free, but I am a slave, even until now. But
if I suffer, I shall be the freed-man of Jesus Christ, and I shall rise
in Him from the dead, free. And now being in bonds, I learn to desire
nothing.
