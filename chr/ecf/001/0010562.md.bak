### <span id="viii.iv.ci-p0.1"></span>Chapter CI.—Christ refers all things to the Father

<span id="viii.iv.ci-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.ci-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.ci-p1.2"></span>“Then what follows of the Psalm is this, in
which He says: ‘Our fathers trusted in Thee; they trusted, and Thou
didst deliver them. They cried unto Thee, and were not confounded. But I
am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people;’
which show that He admits them to be His fathers, who trusted in God and
were saved by Him, who also were the fathers of the Virgin, by whom He
was born and became man; and He foretells that He shall be saved by the
same God, but boasts not in accomplishing anything through His own will
or might. For when on earth He acted in the very same manner, and
answered to one who addressed Him as ‘Good Master:’ ‘Why callest thou me
good? One is good, my Father who is in heaven.’ <span
id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334.md) But when He says, ‘I am a worm, and
no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people,’ He prophesied
the things which do exist, and which happen to Him. For we who believe
on Him are everywhere a reproach, ‘despised of the people;’ for,
rejected and dishonoured by your nation, He suffered those indignities
which you planned against Him. And the following: ‘All they that see me
laughed me to scorn; they spake with the lips, they shook the head: He
trusted in the Lord; let Him deliver him, since he desires Him;’ this
likewise He foretold should happen to Him. <span
id="viii.iv.ci-p2.2"></span>For they that saw Him crucified shook their
heads each one of them, and distorted their lips, and twisting their
noses to each other, <span id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335.md) they
spake in mockery the words which are recorded in the memoirs of His
apostles: ‘He said he was the Son of God: let him come down; let God
save him.’
