### <span id="v.vi.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Avoid schismatics.

<span id="v.vi.iii-p1"></span><span id="v.vi.iii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.vi.iii-p1.2"></span><span id="v.vi.iii-p1.3"></span>Keep
yourselves from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not tend,
because they are not the planting of the Father. Not that I have found
any division among you, but exceeding purity. For as many as are of God
and of Jesus Christ are also with the bishop. And as many as shall, in
the exercise of repentance, return into the unity of the Church, these,
too, shall belong to God, that they may live according to Jesus Christ.
Do not err, my brethren. If any man follows him that makes a schism in
the Church, he shall not inherit the kingdom of God. If any one walks
according to a strange <span id="fr_892"></span>[893](#fn_892.md) opinion,
he agrees not with the passion \[of Christ.\].

<span id="v.vi.iii-p3"></span><span id="v.vi.iii-p3.1"></span><span
id="v.vi.iii-p3.2"></span><span id="v.vi.iii-p3.3"></span>Keep
yourselves, then, from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not
tend, but that wild beast, the destroyer of men, because they are not
the planting of the Father, but the seed of the wicked one. Not that I
have found any division among you do I write these things; but I arm you
beforehand, as the children of God. For as many as are of Christ are
also with the bishop; but as many as fall away from him, and embrace
communion with the accursed, these shall be cut off along with them. For
they are not Christ’s husbandry, but the seed of the enemy, from whom
may you ever be delivered by the prayers of the shepherd, that most
faithful and gentle shepherd who presides over you. I therefore exhort
you in the Lord to receive with all tenderness those that repent and
return to the unity of the Church, that through your kindness and
forbearance they may recover <span id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893.md)
themselves out of the snare of the devil, and becoming worthy of Jesus
Christ, may obtain eternal salvation in the kingdom of Christ. Brethren,
be not deceived. If any man follows him that separates from the truth,
he shall not inherit the kingdom of God; and if any man does not stand
aloof from the preacher of falsehood, he shall be condemned to hell. For
it is obligatory neither to separate from the godly, nor to associate
with the ungodly. If any one walks according to a strange <span
id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894.md) opinion, he is not of Christ, nor a
partaker of His passion; but is a fox, <span
id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895.md) a destroyer of the vineyard of Christ.
Have no fellowship <span id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896.md) with such a
man, lest ye perish along with him, even should he be thy father, thy
son, thy brother, or a member of thy family. For says \[the Scripture\],
“Thine eye shall not spare him.” <span id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897.md)
You ought therefore to “hate those that hate God, and to waste away
\[with grief\] on account of His enemies.” <span
id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898.md) I do not mean that you should beat
them or persecute them, as do the Gentiles “that know not the Lord and
God;” <span id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899.md) but that you should regard
them as your enemies, and separate yourselves from them, while yet you
admonish them, and exhort them to repentance, if it may be they will
hear, if it may be they will submit themselves. <span
id="v.vi.iii-p10.2"></span>For our God is a lover of mankind, and “will
have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the
truth.” <span id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900.md) Wherefore “He makes His
sun to rise upon the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just
and on the unjust;” <span id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901.md) of whose
kindness the Lord, wishing us also to be imitators, says, “Be ye
perfect, even as also your Father that is in heaven is perfect.” <span
id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902.md)
