### <span id="ix.vi.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Concerning sacrifices and oblations, and those who truly offer them.

<span id="ix.vi.xix-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.xix-p1.1"></span>The
oblation of the Church, therefore, which the Lord gave instructions to
be offered throughout all the world, is accounted with God a pure
sacrifice, and is acceptable to Him; not that He stands in need of a
sacrifice from us, but that he who offers is himself glorified in what
he does offer, if his gift be accepted. For by the gift both honour and
affection are shown forth towards the King; and the Lord, wishing us to
offer it in all simplicity and innocence, did express Himself thus:
“Therefore, when thou offerest thy gift upon the altar, and shalt
remember that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave thy gift before
the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then
return and offer thy gift.” <span id="fr_4033"></span>[4034](#fn_4033.md)
We are bound, therefore, to offer to God the first-fruits of His
creation, as Moses also says, “Thou shalt not appear in the presence of
the Lord thy God empty;” <span id="fr_4034"></span>[4035](#fn_4034.md) so
that man, being accounted as grateful, by those things in which he has
shown his gratitude, may receive that honour which flows from Him. <span
id="fr_4035"></span>[4036](#fn_4035.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xix-p5"></span>2. And the class of oblations in general
has not been set aside; for there were both oblations <span
id="page_485">p. 485</span> <span id="ix.vi.xix-Page_485"></span> there
\[among the Jews\], and there are oblations here \[among the
Christians\]. Sacrifices there were among the people; sacrifices there
are, too, in the Church: but the species alone has been changed,
inasmuch as the offering is now made, not by slaves, but by freemen. For
the Lord is \[ever\] one and the same; but the character of a servile
oblation is peculiar \[to itself\], as is also that of freemen, in order
that, by the very oblations, the indication of liberty may be set forth.
For with Him there is nothing purposeless, nor without signification,
nor without design. And for this reason they (the Jews) had indeed the
tithes of their goods consecrated to Him, but those who have received
liberty set aside all their possessions for the Lord’s purposes,
bestowing joyfully and freely not the less valuable portions of their
property, since they have the hope of better things \[hereafter\]; as
that poor widow acted who cast all her living into the treasury of
God. <span id="fr_4036"></span>[4037](#fn_4036.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xix-p7"></span>3. <span id="ix.vi.xix-p7.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.xix-p7.2"></span>For at the beginning God had respect to the
gifts of Abel, because he offered with single-mindedness and
righteousness; but He had no respect unto the offering of Cain, because
his heart was divided with envy and malice, which he cherished against
his brother, as God says when reproving his hidden \[thoughts\], “Though
thou offerest rightly, yet, if thou dost not divide rightly, hast thou
not sinned? Be at rest;” <span id="fr_4037"></span>[4038](#fn_4037.md)
since God is not appeased by sacrifice. For if any one shall endeavour
to offer a sacrifice merely to outward appearance, unexceptionably, in
due order, and according to appointment, while in his soul he does not
assign to his neighbour that fellowship with him which is right and
proper, nor is under the fear of God;— he who thus cherishes secret sin
does not deceive God by that sacrifice which is offered correctly as to
outward appearance; nor will such an oblation profit him anything, but
\[only\] the giving up of that evil which has been conceived within him,
so that sin may not the more, by means of the hypocritical action,
render him the destroyer of himself. <span
id="fr_4038"></span>[4039](#fn_4038.md) Wherefore did the Lord also
declare: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye are
like whited sepulchres. For the sepulchre appears beautiful outside, but
within it is full of dead men’s bones, and all uncleanness; even so ye
also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of
wickedness and hypocrisy.” <span id="fr_4039"></span>[4040](#fn_4039.md)
For while they were thought to offer correctly so far as outward
appearance went, they had in themselves jealousy like to Cain; therefore
they slew the Just One, slighting the counsel of the Word, as did also
Cain. For \[God\] said to him, “Be at rest;” but he did not assent. Now
what else is it to “be at rest” than to forego purposed violence? And
saying similar things to these men, He declares: “Thou blind Pharisee,
cleanse that which is within the cup, that the outside may be clean
also.” <span id="fr_4040"></span>[4041](#fn_4040.md) And they did not
listen to Him. For Jeremiah says, “Behold, neither thine eyes nor thy
heart are good; but \[they are turned\] to thy covetousness, and to shed
innocent blood, and for injustice, and for man-slaying, that thou mayest
do it.” <span id="fr_4041"></span>[4042](#fn_4041.md) And again Isaiah
saith, “Ye have taken counsel, but not of Me; and made covenants,
\[but\] not by My Spirit.” <span id="fr_4042"></span>[4043](#fn_4042.md) In
order, therefore, that their inner wish and thought, being brought to
light, may show that God is without blame, and worketh no evil —that God
who reveals what is hidden \[in the heart\], but who worketh not
evil—when Cain was by no means at rest, He saith to him: “To thee shall
be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.” <span
id="fr_4043"></span>[4044](#fn_4043.md) Thus did He in like manner speak to
Pilate: “Thou shouldest have no power at all against Me, unless it were
given thee from above;” <span id="fr_4044"></span>[4045](#fn_4044.md) God
always giving up the righteous one \[in this life to suffering\], that
he, having been tested by what he suffered and endured, may \[at last\]
be accepted; but that the evildœr, being judged by the actions he has
performed, may be rejected. Sacrifices, therefore, do not sanctify a
man, for God stands in no need of sacrifice; but it is the conscience of
the offerer that sanctifies the sacrifice when it is pure, and thus
moves God to accept \[the offering\] as from a friend. “But the sinner,”
says He, “who kills a calf \[in sacrifice\] to Me, is as if he slew a
dog.” <span id="fr_4045"></span>[4046](#fn_4045.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xix-p17"></span>4. Inasmuch, then, as the Church offers
with single-mindedness, her gift is justly reckoned a pure sacrifice
with God. As Paul also says to the Philippians, “I am full, having
received from Epaphroditus the things that were sent from you, the odour
of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, pleasing to God.” <span
id="fr_4046"></span>[4047](#fn_4046.md) For it behoves us to make an
oblation to God, and in all things to be found grateful to God our
Maker, in a pure mind, and in faith without hypocrisy, in well-grounded
hope, in fervent love, offering the first-fruits of His own created
things. And the Church alone offers this pure oblation to the Creator,
offering to Him, with giving of thanks, \[the things taken\] from His
creation. But the Jews do not offer thus: for their hands are full of
blood; for they have not received the Word, <span id="page_486">p.
486</span> <span id="ix.vi.xix-Page_486"></span> through whom it is
offered to God. <span id="fr_4047"></span>[4048](#fn_4047.md) Nor, again,
do any of the conventicles (*synagogæ*) of the heretics \[offer this\].
For some, by maintaining that the Father is different from the Creator,
do, when they offer to Him what belongs to this creation of ours, set
Him forth as being covetous of another’s property, and desirous of what
is not His own. Those, again, who maintain that the things around us
originated from apostasy, ignorance, and passion, do, while offering
unto Him the fruits of ignorance, passion, and apostasy, sin against
their Father, rather subjecting Him to insult than giving Him thanks.
But how can they be consistent with themselves, \[when they say\] that
the bread over which thanks have been given is the body of their
Lord, <span id="fr_4048"></span>[4049](#fn_4048.md) and the cup His blood,
if they do not call Himself the Son of the Creator of the world, that
is, His Word, through whom the wood fructifies, and the fountains gush
forth, and the earth gives “first the blade, then the ear, then the full
corn in the ear.” <span id="fr_4049"></span>[4050](#fn_4049.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xix-p22"></span>5. <span
id="ix.vi.xix-p22.1"></span>Then, again, how can they say that the
flesh, which is nourished with the body of the Lord and with His blood,
goes to corruption, and does not partake of life? Let them, therefore,
either alter their opinion, or cease from offering the things just
mentioned. <span id="fr_4050"></span>[4051](#fn_4050.md) <span
id="ix.vi.xix-p23.2"></span>But our opinion is in accordance with the
Eucharist, and the Eucharist in turn establishes our opinion. For we
offer to Him His own, announcing consistently the fellowship and union
of the flesh and Spirit. <span id="fr_4051"></span>[4052](#fn_4051.md) For
as the bread, which is produced from the earth, when it receives the
invocation of God, is no longer common bread, <span
id="fr_4052"></span>[4053](#fn_4052.md) but the Eucharist, consisting of
two realities, earthly and heavenly; so also our bodies, when they
receive the Eucharist, are no longer corruptible, having the hope of the
resurrection to eternity.

<span id="ix.vi.xix-p26"></span>6. Now we make offering to Him, not as
though He stood in need of it, but rendering thanks for His gift, <span
id="fr_4053"></span>[4054](#fn_4053.md) and thus sanctifying what has been
created. For even as God does not need our possessions, so do we need to
offer something to God; as Solomon says: “He that hath pity upon the
poor, lendeth unto the Lord.” <span id="fr_4054"></span>[4055](#fn_4054.md)
For God, who stands in need of nothing, takes our good works to Himself
for this purpose, that He may grant us a recompense of His own good
things, as our Lord says: “Come, ye blessed of My Father, receive the
kingdom prepared for you. For I was an hungered, and ye gave Me to eat:
I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me
in: naked, and ye clothed Me; sick, and ye visited Me; in prison, and ye
came to Me.” <span id="fr_4055"></span>[4056](#fn_4055.md) As, therefore,
He does not stand in need of these \[services\], yet does desire that we
should render them for our own benefit, lest we be unfruitful; so did
the Word give to the people that very precept as to the making of
oblations, although He stood in no need of them, that they might learn
to serve God: thus is it, therefore, also His will that we, too, should
offer a gift at the altar, frequently and without intermission. The
altar, then, is in heaven <span id="fr_4056"></span>[4057](#fn_4056.md)
(for towards that place are our prayers and oblations directed); the
temple likewise \[is there\], as John says in the Apocalypse, “And the
temple of God was opened:” <span id="fr_4057"></span>[4058](#fn_4057.md)
the tabernacle also: “For, behold,” He says, “the tabernacle of God, in
which He will dwell with men.”

<span id="ix.vi.xix-p19"></span> The text here fluctuates between *quod
offertur Deo*, and *per quod offertur Deo*. Massuet adopts the former,
and Harvey the latter. If the first reading be chosen, the translation
will be, “the Word who is offered to God,” implying, according to
Massuet, that the body of Christ is really offered as a sacrifice in the
Eucharist; if the second reading be followed, the translation will be as
above. \[Massuet’s idea is no more to be found, even in his text, than
Luther’s or Calvin’s. The crucial point is, *how* offered? One may
answer “figuratively,” “corporally,” “mystically,” or otherwise. Irenæus
gives no answer in this place. But see below.\]
