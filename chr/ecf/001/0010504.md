### <span id="viii.iv.xliii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLIII.—He concludes that the law had an end in Christ, who was born of the Virgin.

<span id="viii.iv.xliii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xliii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xliii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xliii-p1.3"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xliii-p1.4"></span><span id="viii.iv.xliii-p1.5"></span>“As,
then, circumcision began with Abraham, and the Sabbath and sacrifices
and offerings and feasts with Moses, and it has been proved they were
enjoined on account of the hardness of your people’s heart, so it was
necessary, in accordance with the Father’s will, that they should have
an end in Him who was born of a virgin, of the family of Abraham and
tribe of Judah, and of David; <span id="viii.iv.xliii-p1.6"></span>in
Christ the Son of God, who was proclaimed as about to come to all the
world, to be the everlasting law and the everlasting covenant, even as
the forementioned prophecies show. And we, who have approached God
through Him, have received not carnal, but spiritual circumcision, which
Enoch and those like him observed. <span
id="viii.iv.xliii-p1.7"></span>And we have received it through baptism,
since we were sinners, by God’s mercy; and all men may equally obtain
it. But since the mystery of His birth now demands our attention I shall
speak of it. Isaiah then asserted in regard to the generation of Christ,
that it could not be declared by man, in words already quoted: <span
id="fr_2067"></span>[2068](#fn_2067) ‘Who shall declare His generation?
for His life is taken from the earth: for the transgressions of my
people was He led <span id="fr_2068"></span>[2069](#fn_2068) to
death.’ <span id="fr_2069"></span>[2070](#fn_2069) The Spirit of
prophecy thus affirmed that the generation of Him who was to die, that
we sinful men might be healed by His stripes, was such as could not be
declared. Furthermore, that the men who believe in Him may possess the
knowledge of the manner in which He came into the world, <span
id="fr_2070"></span>[2071](#fn_2070) the Spirit of prophecy by the same
Isaiah foretold how it would happen thus: ‘And the Lord spoke again to
Ahaz, saying, Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God, in the
depth, or in the height. And Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I
tempt the Lord. And Isaiah said, Hear then, O house of David; Is it a
small thing for you to contend with men, and how do you contend with the
Lord? Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign. Behold, the
virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and his name shall be
called Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, before he knows or
prefers the evil, and chooses out the good; <span
id="fr_2071"></span>[2072](#fn_2071) for before the child knows good or
ill, he rejects evil <span id="fr_2072"></span>[2073](#fn_2072) by
choosing out the good. For before the child knows how to call father or
mother, he shall receive the power of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria
in presence of the king of Assyria. And the land shall be
forsaken, <span id="fr_2073"></span>[2074](#fn_2073) which thou shalt
with difficulty endure in consequence of the presence of its two
kings. <span id="fr_2074"></span>[2075](#fn_2074) But God shall bring on
thee, and on thy people, and on the house of thy father, days which have
not yet come upon thee since the day in which Ephraim took away from
Judah the king of Assyria.’ <span id="fr_2075"></span>[2076](#fn_2075)
Now it is evident to all, that in the race of Abraham according to the
flesh no one has been born of a virgin, or is said to have been born
\[of a virgin\], save this our Christ. But since you and your teachers
venture to affirm that in the prophecy of Isaiah it is not said,
‘Behold, the virgin shall conceive,’ but, ‘Behold, the young woman shall
conceive, and bear a son;’ and \[since\] you explain the prophecy as if
\[it referred\] to Hezekiah, who was your king, I shall endeavour to
discuss shortly this point in opposition to you, and to show that
reference is made to Him who is acknowledged by us as Christ.
