### <span id="ix.vi.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—That one God formed all things in the world, by means of the Word and the Holy Spirit: and that although He is to us in this life invisible and incomprehensible, nevertheless He is not unknown; inasmuch as His works do declare Him, and His Word has shown that in many modes He may be seen and known.

<span id="ix.vi.xxi-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.xxi-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.xxi-p1.2"></span>As regards His greatness, therefore, it is
not possible to know God, for it is impossible that the Father can be
measured; but as regards His love (for this it is which leads us to God
by His Word), when we obey Him, we do always learn that there is so
great a God, and that it is He who by Himself has established, and
selected, and adorned, and contains all things; and among the all
things, both ourselves and this our world. We also then were made, along
with those things which are contained by Him. And this is He of whom the
Scripture says, “And God formed man, taking clay of the earth, and
breathed into his face the breath of life.” <span
id="fr_4062"></span>[4063](#fn_4062.md) It was not angels, therefore, who
made us, nor who formed us, neither had angels power to make an image of
God, nor any one else, except the Word of the Lord, nor any Power
remotely distant from the Father of all things. For God did not stand in
need of these \[beings\], in order to the accomplishing of what He had
Himself determined with Himself beforehand should be done, as if He did
not possess His own hands. <span id="ix.vi.xxi-p2.2"></span>For with Him
were always present the Word and Wisdom, the Son and the Spirit, by whom
and in whom, <span id="page_488">p. 488</span> <span
id="ix.vi.xxi-Page_488"></span> freely and spontaneously, He made all
things, to whom also He speaks, saying, “Let Us make man after Our image
and likeness;” <span id="fr_4063"></span>[4064](#fn_4063.md) He taking from
Himself the substance of the creatures \[formed\], and the pattern of
things made, and the type of all the adornments in the world.

<span id="ix.vi.xxi-p4"></span>2. Truly, then, the Scripture declared,
which says, “First <span id="fr_4064"></span>[4065](#fn_4064.md) of all
believe that there is one God, who has established all things, and
completed them, and having caused that from what had no being, all
things should come into existence:” He who contains all things, and is
Himself contained by no one. Rightly also has Malachi said among the
prophets: “Is it not one God who hath established us? Have we not all
one Father?” <span id="fr_4065"></span>[4066](#fn_4065.md) In accordance
with this, too, does the apostle say, “There is one God, the Father, who
is above all, and in us all.” <span id="fr_4066"></span>[4067](#fn_4066.md)
Likewise does the Lord also say: “All things are delivered to Me by My
Father;” <span id="fr_4067"></span>[4068](#fn_4067.md) manifestly by Him
who made all things; for He did not deliver to Him the things of
another, but His own. But in *all things* \[it is implied that\] nothing
has been kept back \[from Him\], and for this reason the same person is
the Judge of the living and the dead; “having the key of David: He shall
open, and no man shall shut: He shall shut, and no man shall
open.” <span id="fr_4068"></span>[4069](#fn_4068.md) For no one was able,
either in heaven or in earth, or under the earth, to open the book of
the Father, or to behold Him, with the exception of the Lamb who was
slain, and who redeemed us with His own blood, receiving power over all
things from the same God who made all things by the Word, and adorned
them by \[His\] Wisdom, when “the Word was made flesh;” that even as the
Word of God had the sovereignty in the heavens, so also might He have
the sovereignty in earth, inasmuch as \[He was\] a righteous man, “who
did no sin, neither was there found guile in His mouth;” <span
id="fr_4069"></span>[4070](#fn_4069.md) and that He might have the
pre-eminence over those things which are under the earth, He Himself
being made “the first-begotten of the dead;” <span
id="fr_4070"></span>[4071](#fn_4070.md) and that all things, as I have
already said, might behold their King; and that the paternal light might
meet with and rest upon the flesh of our Lord, and come to us from His
resplendent flesh, and that thus man might attain to immortality, having
been invested with the paternal light.

<span id="ix.vi.xxi-p12"></span>3. I have also largely demonstrated,
that the Word, namely the Son, was always with the Father; and that
Wisdom also, which is the Spirit, was present with Him, anterior to all
creation, He declares by Solomon: “God by Wisdom founded the earth, and
by understanding hath He established the heaven. By His knowledge the
depths burst forth, and the clouds dropped down the dew.” <span
id="fr_4071"></span>[4072](#fn_4071.md) And again: “The Lord created me the
beginning of His ways in His work: He set me up from everlasting, in the
beginning, before He made the earth, before He established the depths,
and before the fountains of waters gushed forth; before the mountains
were made strong, and before all the hills, He brought me forth.” <span
id="fr_4072"></span>[4073](#fn_4072.md) And again: “When He prepared the
heaven, I was with Him, and when He established the fountains of the
deep; when He made the foundations of the earth strong, I was with Him
preparing \[them\]. I was He in whom He rejoiced, and throughout all
time I was daily glad before His face, when He rejoiced at the
completion of the world, and was delighted in the sons of men.” <span
id="fr_4073"></span>[4074](#fn_4073.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xxi-p16"></span>4. There is therefore one God, who by
the Word and Wisdom created and arranged all things; but this is the
Creator (Demiurge) who has granted this world to the human race, and
who, as regards His greatness, is indeed unknown to all who have been
made by Him (for no man has searched out His height, either among the
ancients who have gone to their rest, or any of those who are now
alive); but as regards His love, He is always known through Him by whose
means He ordained all things. Now this is His Word, our Lord Jesus
Christ, who in the last times was made a man among men, that He might
join the end to the beginning, that is, man to God. Wherefore the
prophets, receiving the prophetic gift from the same Word, announced His
advent according to the flesh, by which the blending and communion of
God and man took place according to the good pleasure of the Father, the
Word of God foretelling from the beginning that God should be seen by
men, and hold converse with them upon earth, should confer with them,
and should be present with His own creation, saving it, and becoming
capable of being perceived by it, and freeing us from the hands of all
that hate us, that is, from every spirit of wickedness; and causing us
to serve Him in holiness and righteousness all our days, <span
id="fr_4074"></span>[4075](#fn_4074.md) in order that man, having embraced
the Spirit of God, might pass into the glory of the Father.

<span id="ix.vi.xxi-p18"></span>5. These things did the prophets set
forth in a prophetical manner; but they did not, as some allege,
\[proclaim\] that He who was seen by the prophets was a different
\[God\], the Father of <span id="page_489">p. 489</span> <span
id="ix.vi.xxi-Page_489"></span> all being invisible. Yet this is what
those \[heretics\] declare, who are altogether ignorant of the nature of
prophecy. For prophecy is a prediction of things future, that is, a
setting forth beforehand of those things which shall be afterwards.
<span id="ix.vi.xxi-p18.1"></span><span id="ix.vi.xxi-p18.2"></span>The
prophets, then, indicated beforehand that God should be seen by men; as
the Lord also says, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
God.” <span id="fr_4075"></span>[4076](#fn_4075.md) But in respect to His
greatness, and His wonderful glory, “no man shall see God and
live,” <span id="fr_4076"></span>[4077](#fn_4076.md) for the Father is
incomprehensible; but in regard to His love, and kindness, and as to His
infinite power, even this He grants to those who love Him, that is, to
see God, which thing the prophets did also predict. “For those things
that are impossible with men, are possible with God.” <span
id="fr_4077"></span>[4078](#fn_4077.md) For man does not see God by his own
powers; but when He pleases He is seen by men, by whom He wills, and
when He wills, and as He wills. For God is powerful in all things,
having been seen at that time indeed, prophetically through the Spirit,
and seen, too, adoptively through the Son; and He shall also be seen
paternally in the kingdom of heaven, the Spirit truly preparing man in
the Son <span id="fr_4078"></span>[4079](#fn_4078.md) of God, and the Son
leading him to the Father, while the Father, too, confers \[upon him\]
incorruption for eternal life, which comes to every one from the fact of
his seeing God. For as those who see the light are within the light, and
partake of its brilliancy; even so, those who see God are in God, and
receive of His splendour. But \[His\] splendour vivifies them; those,
therefore, who see God, do receive life. And for this reason, He,
\[although\] beyond comprehension, and boundless and invisible, rendered
Himself visible, and comprehensible, and within the capacity of those
who believe, that He might vivify those who receive and behold Him
through faith. <span id="fr_4079"></span>[4080](#fn_4079.md) For as His
greatness is past finding out, so also His goodness is beyond
expression; by which having been seen, He bestows life upon those who
see Him. It is not possible to live apart from life, and the means of
life is found in fellowship with God; but fellowship with God is to know
God, and to enjoy His goodness.

<span id="ix.vi.xxi-p24"></span>6. Men therefore shall see God, that
they may live, being made immortal by that sight, and attaining even
unto God; which, as I have already said, was declared figuratively by
the prophets, that God should be seen by men who bear His Spirit \[in
them\], and do always wait patiently for His coming. As also Moses says
in Deuteronomy, “We shall see in that day that God will talk to man, and
he shall live.” <span id="fr_4080"></span>[4081](#fn_4080.md) For certain
of these men used to see the prophetic Spirit and His active influences
poured forth for all kinds of gifts; others, again, \[beheld\] the
advent of the Lord, and that dispensation which obtained from the
beginning, by which He accomplished the will of the Father with regard
to things both celestial and terrestrial; and others \[beheld\] paternal
glories adapted to the times, and to those who saw and who heard them
then, and to all who were subsequently to hear them. Thus, therefore,
was God revealed; for God the Father is shown forth through all these
\[operations\], the Spirit indeed working, and the Son ministering,
while the Father was approving, and man’s salvation being accomplished.
As He also declares through Hosea the prophet: “I,” He says, “have
multiplied visions, and have used similitudes by the ministry (*in
manibus*) of the prophets.” <span id="fr_4081"></span>[4082](#fn_4081.md)
But the apostle expounded this very passage, when he said, “Now there
are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are differences
of ministrations, but the same Lord; and there are diversities of
operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. But the
manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit
withal.” <span id="fr_4082"></span>[4083](#fn_4082.md) But as He who
worketh all things in all is God, \[as to the points\] of what nature
and how great He is, \[God\] is invisible and indescribable to all
things which have been made by Him, but He is by no means unknown: for
all things learn through His Word that there is one God the Father, who
contains all things, and who grants existence to all, as is written in
the Gospel: “No man hath seen God at any time, except the only-begotten
Son, who is in the bosom of the Father; He has declared \[Him\].” <span
id="fr_4083"></span>[4084](#fn_4083.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xxi-p29"></span>7. <span
id="ix.vi.xxi-p29.1"></span><span id="ix.vi.xxi-p29.2"></span>Therefore
the Son of the Father declares \[Him\] from the beginning, inasmuch as
He was with the Father from the beginning, who did also show to the
human race prophetic visions, and diversities of gifts, and His own
ministrations, and the glory of the Father, in regular order and
connection, at the fitting time for the benefit \[of mankind\]. For
where there is a regular succession, there is also fixedness; and where
fixedness, there suitability to the period; and where suitability, there
also utility. And for this reason did the Word become the dispenser of
the paternal grace for the benefit of men, for whom He made such great
dispensations, revealing God indeed to men, but presenting man to God,
and preserving at the same time the invisibility of the Father, lest man
should at any time become a despiser of God, and that he should <span
id="page_490">p. 490</span> <span id="ix.vi.xxi-Page_490"></span> always
possess something towards which he might advance; but, on the other
hand, revealing God to men through many dispensations, lest man, falling
away from God altogether, should cease to exist. For the glory of God is
a living man; and the life of man consists in beholding God. For if the
manifestation of God which is made by means of the creation, affords
life to all living in the earth, much more does that revelation of the
Father which comes through the Word, give life to those who see God.

<span id="ix.vi.xxi-p30"></span>8. <span
id="ix.vi.xxi-p30.1"></span>Inasmuch, then, as the Spirit of God pointed
out by the prophets things to come, forming and adapting us beforehand
for the purpose of our being made subject to God, but it was still a
future thing that man, through the good pleasure of the Holy Spirit,
should see \[God\], it necessarily behoved those through whose
instrumentality future things were announced, to see God, whom they
intimated as to be seen by men; in order that God, and the Son of God,
and the Son, and the Father, should not only be prophetically announced,
but that He should also be seen by all His members who are sanctified
and instructed in the things of God, that man might be disciplined
beforehand and previously exercised for a reception into that glory
which shall afterwards be revealed in those who love God. For the
prophets used not to prophesy in word alone, but in visions also, and in
their mode of life, and in the actions which they performed, according
to the suggestions of the Spirit. After this invisible manner,
therefore, did they see God, as also Esaias says, “I have seen with mine
eyes the King, the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.xxi-p30.2"></span>Lord</span> of hosts,” <span
id="fr_4084"></span>[4085](#fn_4084.md) pointing out that man should behold
God with his eyes, and hear His voice. In this manner, therefore, did
they also see the Son of God as a man conversant with men, while they
prophesied what was to happen, saying that He who was not come as yet
was present proclaiming also the impassible as subject to suffering, and
declaring that He who was then in heaven had descended into the dust of
death. <span id="fr_4085"></span>[4086](#fn_4085.md) Moreover, \[with
regard to\] the other arrangements concerning the summing up that He
should make, some of these they beheld through visions, others they
proclaimed by word, while others they indicated typically by means of
\[outward\] action, seeing visibly those things which were to be seen;
heralding by word of mouth those which should be heard; and performing
by actual operation what should take place by action; but \[at the same
time\] announcing all prophetically. Wherefore also Moses declared that
God was indeed a consuming fire <span
id="fr_4086"></span>[4087](#fn_4086) (*igneum*.md) to the people that
transgressed the law, and threatened that God would bring upon them a
day of fire; but to those who had the fear of God he said, “The <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.xxi-p33.2"></span>Lord</span> God is
merciful and gracious, and long-suffering, and of great commiseration,
and true, and keeps justice and mercy for thousands, forgiving
unrighteousness, and transgressions, and sins.” <span
id="fr_4087"></span>[4088](#fn_4087.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xxi-p35"></span>9. And the Word spake to Moses,
appearing before him, “just as any one might speak to his friend.” <span
id="fr_4088"></span>[4089](#fn_4088.md) But Moses desired to see Him openly
who was speaking with him, and was thus addressed: “Stand in the deep
place of the rock, and with My hand I will cover thee. But when My
splendour shall pass by, then thou shalt see My back parts, but My face
thou shalt not see: for no man sees My face, and shall live.” <span
id="fr_4089"></span>[4090](#fn_4089.md) Two facts are thus signified: that
it is impossible for man to see God; and that, through the wisdom of
God, man shall see Him in the last times, in the depth of a rock, that
is, in His coming as a man. And for this reason did He \[the Lord\]
confer with him face to face on the top of a mountain, Elias being also
present, as the Gospel relates, <span
id="fr_4090"></span>[4091](#fn_4090.md) He thus making good in the end the
ancient promise.

<span id="ix.vi.xxi-p39"></span>10. The prophets, therefore, did not
openly behold the actual face of God, but \[they saw\] the dispensations
and the mysteries through which man should afterwards see God. As was
also said to Elias: “Thou shalt go forth tomorrow, and stand in the
presence of the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.xxi-p39.1"></span>Lord</span>; and, behold, a wind great and
strong, which shall rend the mountains, and break the rocks in pieces
before the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.xxi-p39.2"></span>Lord</span>. And the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.xxi-p39.3"></span>Lord</span> \[was\] not
in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.xxi-p39.4"></span>Lord</span> \[was\] not
in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord \[was\]
not in the fire; and after the fire a scarcely audible voice” (*vox auræ
tenuis*). <span id="fr_4091"></span>[4092](#fn_4091.md) For by such means
was the prophet—very indignant, because of the transgression of the
people and the slaughter of the prophets—both taught to act in a more
gentle manner; and the Lord’s advent as a man was pointed out, that it
should be subsequent to that law which was given by Moses, mild and
tranquil, in which He would neither break the bruised reed, nor quench
the smoking flax. <span id="fr_4092"></span>[4093](#fn_4092.md) The mild
and peaceful repose of His kingdom was indicated likewise. For, after
the wind which rends the mountains, and after the earthquake, and after
the fire, come the tranquil and peaceful times of His kingdom, in which
the spirit of God does, in the most gentle manner, vivify and increase
mankind. This, too, was made still clearer by Ezekiel, that the prophets
<span id="page_491">p. 491</span> <span id="ix.vi.xxi-Page_491"></span>
saw the dispensations of God in part, but not actually God Himself. For
when this man had seen the vision <span
id="fr_4093"></span>[4094](#fn_4093.md) of God, and the cherubim, and their
wheels, and when he had recounted the mystery of the whole of that
progression, and had beheld the likeness of a throne above them, and
upon the throne a likeness as of the figure of a man, and the things
which were upon his loins as the figure of amber, and what was below
like the sight of fire, and when he set forth all the rest of the vision
of the thrones, lest any one might happen to think that in those
\[visions\] he had actually seen God, he added: “This was the appearance
of the likeness of the glory of God.” <span
id="fr_4094"></span>[4095](#fn_4094.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xxi-p44"></span>11. If, then, neither Moses, nor Elias,
nor Ezekiel, who had all many celestial visions, did see God; but if
what they did see were similitudes of the splendour of the Lord, and
prophecies of things to come; it is manifest that the Father is indeed
invisible, of whom also the Lord said, “No man hath seen God at any
time.” <span id="fr_4095"></span>[4096](#fn_4095.md) But His Word, as He
Himself willed it, and for the benefit of those who beheld, did show the
Father’s brightness, and explained His purposes (as also the Lord said:
“The only-begotten God, <span id="fr_4096"></span>[4097](#fn_4096.md) which
is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared \[Him\];” and He does
Himself also interpret the Word of the Father as being rich and great);
not in one figure, nor in one character, did He appear to those seeing
Him, but according to the reasons and effects aimed at in His
dispensations, as it is written in Daniel. For at one time He was seen
with those who were around Ananias, Azarias, Misaël, as present with
them in the furnace of fire, in the burning, and preserving them from
\[the effects of\] fire: “And the appearance of the fourth,” it is said,
“was like to the Son of God.” <span id="fr_4097"></span>[4098](#fn_4097.md)
At another time \[He is represented as\] “a stone cut out of the
mountain without hands,” <span id="fr_4098"></span>[4099](#fn_4098.md) and
as smiting all temporal kingdoms, and as blowing them away (*ventilans
ea*), and as Himself filling all the earth. Then, too, is this same
individual beheld as the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, and
drawing near to the Ancient of Days, and receiving from Him all power
and glory, and a kingdom. “His dominion,” it is said, “is an everlasting
dominion, and His kingdom shall not perish.” <span
id="fr_4099"></span>[4100](#fn_4099.md) John also, the Lord’s disciple,
when beholding the sacerdotal and glorious advent of His kingdom, says
in the Apocalypse: “I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And,
being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; and in the midst of the
candlesticks One like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment
reaching to the feet, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle; and
His head and His hairs were white, as white as wool, and as snow; and
His eyes were as a flame of fire; and His feet like unto fine brass, as
if He burned in a furnace. And His voice \[was\] as the voice of waters;
and He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth went a
sharp two-edged sword; and His countenance was as the sun shining in his
strength.” <span id="fr_4100"></span>[4101](#fn_4100.md) For in these words
He sets forth something of the glory \[which He has received\] from His
Father, as \[where He makes mention of\] the head; something in
reference to the priestly office also, as in the case of the long
garment reaching to the feet. And this was the reason why Moses vested
the high priest after this fashion. Something also alludes to the end
\[of all things\], as \[where He speaks of\] the fine brass burning in
the fire, which denotes the power of faith, and the continuing instant
in prayer, because of the consuming fire which is to come at the end of
time. But when John could not endure the sight (for he says, “I fell at
his feet as dead;” <span id="fr_4101"></span>[4102](#fn_4101.md) that what
was written might come to pass: “No man sees God, and shall live” <span
id="fr_4102"></span>[4103](#fn_4102) .md), and the Word reviving him, and
reminding him that it was He upon whose bosom he had leaned at supper,
when he put the question as to who should betray Him, declared: “I am
the first and the last, and He who liveth, and was dead, and behold I am
alive for evermore, and have the keys of death and of hell.” And after
these things, seeing the same Lord in a second vision, he says: “For I
saw in the midst of the throne, and of the four living creatures, and in
the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as it had been slain, having
seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent
forth into all the earth.” <span id="fr_4103"></span>[4104](#fn_4103.md)
And again, he says, speaking of this very same Lamb: “And behold a white
horse; and He that sat upon him was called Faithful and True; and in
righteousness doth He judge and make war. And His eyes were as a flame
of fire, and on His head were many crowns; having a name written, that
no man knoweth but Himself: and He was girded around with a vesture
sprinkled with blood: and His name is called The Word of God. And the
armies of heaven followed Him upon white horses, clothed in pure white
linen. And out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it He may
smite the nations; and He shall <span id="page_492">p. 492</span> <span
id="ix.vi.xxi-Page_492"></span> rule (*pascet*) them with a rod of iron:
and He treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of God
Almighty. And He hath upon His vesture and upon His thigh a name
written, <span class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.xxi-p53.2"></span>King of
Kings and Lord of Lords.</span>” <span
id="fr_4104"></span>[4105](#fn_4104.md) Thus does the Word of God always
preserve the outlines, as it were, of things to come, and points out to
men the various forms (*species*), as it were, of the dispensations of
the Father, teaching us the things pertaining to God.

<span id="ix.vi.xxi-p55"></span>12. However, it was not by means of
visions alone which were seen, and words which were proclaimed, but also
in actual works, that He was beheld by the prophets, in order that
through them He might prefigure and show forth future events beforehand.
For this reason did Hosea the prophet take “a wife of whoredoms,”
prophesying by means of the action, “that in committing fornication the
earth should fornicate from the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.xxi-p55.1"></span>Lord</span>,” <span
id="fr_4105"></span>[4106](#fn_4105.md) that is, the men who are upon the
earth; and from men of this stamp it will be God’s good pleasure to take
out <span id="fr_4106"></span>[4107](#fn_4106.md) a Church which shall be
sanctified by fellowship with His Son, just as that woman was sanctified
by intercourse with the prophet. And for this reason, Paul declares that
the “unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband.” <span
id="fr_4107"></span>[4108](#fn_4107.md) Then again, the prophet names his
children, “Not having obtained mercy,” and “Not a people,” <span
id="fr_4108"></span>[4109](#fn_4108.md) in order that, as says the apostle,
“what was not a people may become a people; and she who did not obtain
mercy may obtain mercy. And it shall come to pass, that in the place
where it was said, This is not a people, there shall they be called the
children of the living God.” <span id="fr_4109"></span>[4110](#fn_4109.md)
That which had been done typically through his actions by the prophet,
the apostle proves to have been done truly by Christ in the Church.
Thus, too, did Moses also take to wife an Ethiopian woman, whom he thus
made an Israelitish one, showing by anticipation that the wild olive
tree is grafted into the cultivated olive, and made to partake of its
fatness. For as He who was born Christ according to the flesh, had
indeed to be sought after by the people in order to be slain, but was to
be set free in Egypt, that is, among the Gentiles, to sanctify those who
were there in a state of infancy, from whom also He perfected His Church
in that place (for Egypt was Gentile from the beginning, as was Ethiopia
also); for this reason, by means of the marriage of Moses, was shown
forth the marriage of the Word; <span
id="fr_4110"></span>[4111](#fn_4110.md) and by means of the Ethiopian
bride, the Church taken from among the Gentiles was made manifest; and
those who do detract from, accuse, and deride it, shall not be pure. For
they shall be full of leprosy, and expelled from the camp of the
righteous. Thus also did Rahab the harlot, while condemning herself,
inasmuch as she was a Gentile, guilty of all sins, nevertheless receive
the three spies, <span id="fr_4111"></span>[4112](#fn_4111.md) who were
spying out all the land, and hid them at her home; \[which three were\]
doubtless \[a type of\] the Father and the Son, together with the Holy
Spirit. And when the entire city in which she lived fell to ruins at the
sounding of the seven trumpets, Rahab the harlot was preserved, when all
was over \[*in ultimis*\], together with all her house, through faith of
the scarlet sign; as the Lord also declared to those who did not receive
His advent,—the Pharisees, no doubt, nullify the sign of the scarlet
thread, which meant the passover, and the redemption and exodus of the
people from Egypt,—when He said, “The publicans and the harlots go into
the kingdom of heaven before you.” <span
