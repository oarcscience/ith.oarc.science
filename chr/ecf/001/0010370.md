the wife of Cleophas or Alphæus, who was the mother of James the bishop
and apostle, and of Simon and Thaddeus, and of one Joseph; (3.) Mary
Salome, wife of Zebedee, mother of John the evangelist and James; (4.)
Mary Magdalene. These four are found in the Gospel. James and Judas and
Joseph were sons of an aunt (2) of the Lord’s. James also and John were
sons of another aunt (3) of the Lord’s. Mary (2), mother of James the
Less and Joseph, wife of Alphæus was the sister of Mary the mother of
the Lord, whom John names of Cleophas, either from her father or from
the family of the clan, or for some other reason. Mary Salome (3) is
called Salome either from her husband or her village. Some affirm that
she is the same as Mary of Cleophas, because she had two husbands.

states that it forms part of a dictionary written by “a mediæval Papias.
\[He seems to have added the words, “Maria is called Illuminatrix, or
Star of the Sea,” etc, a middle-age device.\] The dictionary exists in
