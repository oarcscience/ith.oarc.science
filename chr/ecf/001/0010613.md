### <span id="viii.vi.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Opinions of the school of Thales.

<span id="viii.vi.iii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.iii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.vi.iii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.vi.iii-p1.3"></span>And if you decline citing the poets,
because you say it is allowable for them to frame myths, and to relate
in a mythical way many things about the gods which are far from true, do
you suppose you have some others for your religious teachers, or how do
you say that they themselves <span id="fr_2516"></span>[2517](#fn_2516.md)
have learned this religion of yours? For it is impossible that any
should know matters so great and divine, who have not themselves learned
them first from the initiated. <span
id="fr_2517"></span>[2518](#fn_2517.md) You will no doubt say, “The sages
and philosophers.” For to them, as to a fortified wall, you are wont to
flee, when any one quotes the opinions of your poets about the gods.
Therefore, since it is fit that we commence with the ancients and the
earliest, beginning thence I will produce the opinion of each, much more
ridiculous as it is than the theology of the poets. <span
id="viii.vi.iii-p3.1"></span>For Thales of Miletus, who took the lead in
the study of natural philosophy, declared that water was the first
principle of all things; for from water he says that all things are, and
that into water all are resolved. <span id="viii.vi.iii-p3.2"></span>And
after him Anaximander, who came from the same Miletus, said that the
infinite was the first principle of all things; for that from this
indeed all things are produced, and into this do all decay. Thirdly,
Anaximenes—and he too was from Miletus—says that air is the first
principle of all things; for he says that from this all things are
produced, and into this all are resolved. <span
id="viii.vi.iii-p3.3"></span>Heraclitus and Hippasus, from Metapontus,
say that fire is the first principle of all things; for from fire all
things proceed, and in fire do all things terminate. Anaxagoras of
Clazomenæ said that the homogeneous parts are the first principles of
all things. <span id="viii.vi.iii-p3.4"></span>Archelaus, the son of
Apollodorus, an Athenian, says that the infinite air and its density and
rarity are the first principle of all things. All these, forming a
succession from Thales, followed the philosophy called by themselves
physical.
