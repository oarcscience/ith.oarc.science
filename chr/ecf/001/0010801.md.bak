### <span id="ix.vi.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Explanation of the words of Christ, “No man knoweth the Father, but the Son,” etc.; which words the heretics misinterpret. Proof that, by the Father revealing the Son, and by the Son being revealed, the Father was never unknown.

<span id="ix.vi.vii-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.vii-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.vii-p1.2"></span>For the Lord, revealing Himself to His
disciples, that He Himself is the Word, who imparts knowledge of the
Father, and reproving the Jews, who imagined that they, had \[the
knowledge of\] God, while they nevertheless rejected His Word, through
whom God is made known, declared, “No man knoweth the Son, but the
Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whom
the Son has willed to reveal \[Him\].” <span
id="fr_3856"></span>[3857](#fn_3856.md) Thus hath Matthew set it <span
id="page_468">p. 468</span> <span id="ix.vi.vii-Page_468"></span> down,
and Luke in like manner, and Mark <span
id="fr_3857"></span>[3858](#fn_3857.md) the very same; for John omits this
passage. They, however, who would be wiser than the apostles, write
\[the verse\] in the following manner: “No man *knew* the Father, but
the Son; nor the Son, but the Father, and he to whom the Son has willed
to reveal \[Him\];” and they explain it as if the true God were known to
none prior to our Lord’s advent; and that God who was announced by the
prophets, they allege not to be the Father of Christ.

<span id="ix.vi.vii-p4"></span>2. But if Christ did then \[only\] begin
to have existence when He came \[into the world\] as man, and \[if\] the
Father did remember \[only\] in the times of Tiberius Cæsar to provide
for \[the wants of\] men, and His Word was shown to have not always
coexisted with His creatures; \[it may be remarked that\] neither then
was it necessary that another God should be proclaimed, but \[rather\]
that the reasons for so great carelessness and neglect on His part
should be made the subject of investigation. For it is fitting that no
such question should arise, and gather such strength, that it would
indeed both change God, and destroy our faith in that Creator who
supports us by means of His creation. For as we do direct our faith
towards the Son, so also should we possess a firm and immoveable love
towards the Father. <span id="ix.vi.vii-p4.1"></span>In his book against
Marcion, Justin <span id="fr_3858"></span>[3859](#fn_3858.md) does well
say: “I would not have believed the Lord Himself, if He had announced
any other than He who is our framer, maker, and nourisher. But because
the only-begotten Son came to us from the one God, who both made this
world and formed us, and contains and administers all things, summing up
His own handiwork in Himself, my faith towards Him is stedfast, and my
love to the Father immoveable, God bestowing both upon us.”

<span id="ix.vi.vii-p6"></span>3. <span id="ix.vi.vii-p6.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.vii-p6.2"></span><span id="ix.vi.vii-p6.3"></span>For no one
can know the Father, unless through the Word of God, that is, unless by
the Son revealing \[Him\]; neither can he have knowledge of the Son,
unless through the good pleasure of the Father. But the Son performs the
good pleasure of the Father; for the Father sends, and the Son is sent,
and comes. And His Word knows that His Father is, as far as regards us,
invisible and infinite; and since He cannot be declared \[by any one
else\], He does Himself declare Him to us; and, on the other hand, it is
the Father alone who knows His own Word. And both these truths has our
Lord declared. Wherefore the Son reveals the knowledge of the Father
through His own manifestation. For the manifestation of the Son is the
knowledge of the Father; for all things are manifested through the Word.
In order, therefore, that we might know that the Son who came is He who
imparts to those believing on Him a knowledge of the Father, He said to
His disciples: <span id="fr_3859"></span>[3860](#fn_3859.md) “No man
knoweth the Son but the Father, nor the Father but the Son, and those to
whomsoever the Son shall reveal Him;” thus setting Himself forth and the
Father as He \[really\] is, that we may not receive any other Father,
except Him who is revealed by the Son.

<span id="ix.vi.vii-p8"></span>4. But this \[Father\] is the Maker of
heaven and earth, as is shown from His words; and not he, the false
father, who has been invented by Marcion, or by Valentinus, or by
Basilides, or by Carpocrates, or by Simon, or by the rest of the
“Gnostics,” falsely so called. For none of these was the Son of God; but
Christ Jesus our Lord \[was\], against whom they set their teaching in
opposition, and have the daring to preach an unknown God. But they ought
to hear \[this\] against themselves: How is it that He is unknown, who
is known by them? for, whatever is known even by a few, is not unknown.
But the Lord did not say that both the Father and the Son could not be
known at all (*in totum*), for in that case His advent would have been
superfluous. For why did He come hither? Was it that He should say to
us, “Never mind seeking after God; for He is unknown, and ye shall not
find Him;” as also the disciples of Valentinus falsely declare that
Christ said to their Æons? But this is indeed vain. For the Lord taught
us that no man is capable of knowing God, unless he be taught of God;
that is, that God cannot be known without God: but that this is the
express will of the Father, that God should be known. For they shall
know <span id="fr_3860"></span>[3861](#fn_3860.md) Him to whomsoever the
Son has revealed Him.

<span id="ix.vi.vii-p10"></span>5. And for this purpose did the Father
reveal the Son, that through His instrumentality He might be manifested
to all, and might receive those righteous ones who believe in Him into
incorruption and everlasting enjoyment (now, to believe in Him is to do
His will); but He shall righteously shut out into the darkness which
they have chosen for themselves, those who do not believe, and who do
consequently avoid His light. The Father therefore has revealed Himself
to all, by making His Word visible to all; and, conversely, the Word has
declared to all the Father and the Son, since He has become visible to
all. And therefore the righteous judgment of God \[shall fall\] upon all
who, like <span id="page_469">p. 469</span> <span
id="ix.vi.vii-Page_469"></span> others, have seen, but have not, like
others, believed.

<span id="ix.vi.vii-p11"></span>6. For by means of the creation itself,
the Word reveals God the Creator; and by means of the world \[does He
declare\] the Lord the Maker of the world; and by means of the formation
\[of man\] the Artificer who formed him; and by the Son that Father who
begat the Son: and these things do indeed address all men in the same
manner, but all do not in the same way believe them. But by the law and
the prophets did the Word preach both Himself and the Father alike \[to
all\]; and all the people heard Him alike, but all did not alike
believe. And through the Word Himself who had been made visible and
palpable, was the Father shown forth, although all did not equally
believe in Him; but all saw the Father in the Son: for the Father is the
invisible of the Son, but the Son the visible of the Father. And for
this reason all spake with Christ when He was present \[upon earth\],
and they named Him God. Yea, even the demons exclaimed, on beholding the
Son: “We know Thee who Thou art, the Holy One of God.” <span
id="fr_3861"></span>[3862](#fn_3861.md) And the devil looking at Him, and
tempting Him, said: “If Thou art the Son of God;” <span
id="fr_3862"></span>[3863](#fn_3862.md) —all thus indeed seeing and
speaking of the Son and the Father, but all not believing \[in them\].

<span id="ix.vi.vii-p14"></span>7. For it was fitting that the truth
should receive testimony from all, and should become \[a means of\]
judgment for the salvation indeed of those who believe, but for the
condemnation of those who believe not; that all should be fairly judged,
and that the faith in the Father and Son should be approved by all, that
is, that it should be established by all \[as the one means of
salvation\], receiving testimony from all, both from those belonging to
it, since they are its friends, and by those having no connection with
it, though they are its enemies. For that evidence is true, and cannot
be gainsaid, which elicits even from its adversaries striking <span
id="fr_3863"></span>[3864](#fn_3863.md) testimonies in its behalf; they
being convinced with respect to the matter in hand by their own plain
contemplation of it, and bearing testimony to it, as well as declaring
it. <span id="fr_3864"></span>[3865](#fn_3864.md) But after a while they
break forth into enmity, and become accusers \[of what they had
approved\], and are desirous that their own testimony should not be
\[regarded as\] true. He, therefore, who was known, was not a different
being from Him who declared “No man knoweth the Father,” but one and the
same, the Father making all things subject to Him; while He received
testimony from all that He was very man, and that He was very God, from
the Father, from the Spirit, from angels, from the creation itself, from
men, from apostate spirits and demons, from the enemy, and last of all,
from death itself. But the Son, administering all things for the Father,
works from the beginning even to the end, and without Him no man can
attain the knowledge of God. For the Son is the knowledge of the Father;
but the knowledge of the Son is in the Father, and has been revealed
through the Son; and this was the reason why the Lord declared: “No man
knoweth the Son, but the Father; nor the Father, save the Son, and those
to whomsoever the Son shall reveal \[Him\].” <span
id="fr_3865"></span>[3866](#fn_3865.md) For “shall reveal” was said not
with reference to the future alone, as if then \[only\] the Word had
begun to manifest the Father when He was born of Mary, but it applies
indifferently throughout all time. For the Son, being present with His
own handiwork from the beginning, reveals the Father to all; to whom He
wills, and when He wills, and as the Father wills. Wherefore, then, in
all things, and through all things, there is one God, the Father, and
one Word, and one Son, and one Spirit, and one salvation to all who
believe in Him.

venerable author.” It is probable, therefore, that the previous passage
has been made to harmonize with the received text by a later hand; with
which, however, the Syriac form agrees.
