### <span id="ix.ii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Passages of Scripture by which they attempt to prove that the Supreme Father was unknown before the coming of Christ.

<span id="ix.ii.xx-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.ii.xx-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.ii.xx-p1.2"></span>I judge it necessary to add to these details
also what, by garbling passages of Scripture, they try to persuade us
concerning their Propator, who was unknown to all before the coming of
Christ. Their object in this is to show that our Lord announced another
Father than the Maker of this universe, whom, as we said before, they
impiously declare to have been the fruit of a defect. For instance, when
the prophet Isaiah says, “But Israel hath not known Me, and My people
have not understood Me,” <span id="fr_2905"></span>[2906](#fn_2905.md) they
pervert his words to mean ignorance of the invisible Bythus. And that
which is spoken by Hosea, “There is no truth in them, nor the knowledge
of God,” <span id="fr_2906"></span>[2907](#fn_2906.md) they strive to give
the same reference. And, “There is none that understandeth, or that
seeketh after God: they have all gone out of the way, they are together
become unprofitable,” <span id="fr_2907"></span>[2908](#fn_2907.md) they
maintain to be said concerning ignorance of Bythus. Also that which is
spoken by Moses, “No man shall see God and live,” <span
id="fr_2908"></span>[2909](#fn_2908.md) has, as they would persuade us, the
same reference.

<span id="ix.ii.xx-p6"></span>2. For they falsely hold, that the Creator
was seen by the prophets. But this passage, “No man shall see God and
live,” they would interpret as spoken of His greatness unseen and
unknown by all; and indeed that these words, “No man shall see God,” are
spoken concerning the invisible Father, the Maker of the universe, is
evident to us all; but that they are not used concerning that Bythus
whom they conjure into existence, but concerning the Creator (and He is
the invisible God), shall be shown as we proceed. They maintain that
Daniel also set forth the same thing when he begged of the angels
explanations of the parables, as being himself ignorant of them. But the
angel, hiding from him the great mystery of Bythus, said unto him, “Go
thy way quickly, Daniel, for these sayings are closed up until those who
have understanding do understand them, and those who are white be made
white.” <span id="fr_2909"></span>[2910](#fn_2909.md) Moreover, they vaunt
themselves as being the *white* and the men of *good understanding*.
