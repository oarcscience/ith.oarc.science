### <span id="viii.iv.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—Heretics confirm the Catholics in the faith.

<span id="viii.iv.xxxv-p1"></span>And Trypho said, “I believe, however,
that many of those who say that they confess Jesus, and are called
Christians, eat meats offered to idols, and declare that they are by no
means injured in consequence.” And I replied, “The fact that there are
such men confessing themselves to be Christians, and admitting the
crucified Jesus to be both Lord and Christ, yet not teaching His
doctrines, but those of the spirits of error, causes us who are
disciples of the true and pure doctrine of Jesus Christ, to be more
faithful and stedfast in the hope announced by Him. For what things He
predicted would take place in His name, these we do see being actually
accomplished in our sight. For he said, ‘Many shall come in My name,
clothed outwardly in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
wolves.’ ” <span id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034) And, ‘There shall
be schisms and heresies.’ <span id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035)
And, ‘Beware of false prophets, who shall come to you clothed outwardly
in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.’ <span
id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036) And, ‘Many false Christs and false
apostles shall arise, and shall deceive many of the faithful.’ <span
id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037) There are, therefore, and there
were many, my friends, who, coming forward in the name of Jesus, taught
both to speak and act impious and blasphemous things; and these are
called by us after the name of the men from whom each doctrine and
opinion had its origin. (For some in one way, others in another, teach
to blaspheme the Maker of all things, and Christ, who was foretold by
Him as coming, and the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, with
whom we have nothing in common, since we know them to be atheists,
impious, unrighteous, and sinful, and confessors of Jesus in name only,
instead of worshippers of Him. Yet they style themselves Christians,
just as certain among the Gentiles inscribe the name of God upon the
works of their own hands, and partake in nefarious and impious rites.)
Some are called Marcians, and some Valentinians, and some Basilidians,
and some Saturnilians, and others by other names; each called after the
originator of the individual opinion, just as each one of those who
consider themselves philosophers, as I said before, thinks he must bear
the name of the philosophy which he follows, from the name of the father
of the particular doctrine. So that, in consequence of these events, we
know that Jesus foreknew what would happen after Him, as well as in
consequence of many other events which He foretold would befall those
who believed on and confessed Him, the Christ. For all that we suffer,
even when killed by friends, He foretold would take place; so that it is
manifest no word or act of His can be found fault with. Wherefore we
pray for you and for all other men who hate us; in order that you,
having repented along with us, may not blaspheme Him who, by His works,
by the mighty deeds even now wrought through His name, by the words He
taught, by the prophecies announced concerning Him, is the blameless,
and in all things irreproachable, Christ Jesus; but, believing on Him,
may be saved in His second glorious advent, and may not be condemned to
fire by Him.”
