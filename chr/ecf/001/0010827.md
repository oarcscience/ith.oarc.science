### <span id="ix.vi.xxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—That one God was the author of both Testaments, is confirmed by the authority of a presbyter who had been taught by the apostles.

<span id="ix.vi.xxxiii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.vi.xxxiii-p1.2"></span>After
this fashion also did a presbyter, <span
id="fr_4241"></span>[4242](#fn_4241.md) a disciple of the apostles, reason
with respect to the two testaments, proving that both were truly from
one and the same God. For \[he maintained\] that there was no other God
besides Him who made and fashioned us, and that the discourse of those
men has no foundation who affirm that this world of ours was made either
by angels, or by any other power whatsoever, or by another God. For if a
man be once moved away from the Creator of all things, and if he grant
that this creation to which we belong was formed by any other or through
any other \[than the one God\], he must of necessity fall into much
inconsistency, and many contradictions of this sort; to which he will
\[be able to\] furnish <span id="page_506">p. 506</span> <span
id="ix.vi.xxxiii-Page_506"></span> no explanations which can be regarded
as either probable or true. And, for this reason, those who introduce
other doctrines conceal from us the opinion which they themselves hold
respecting God, because they are aware of the untenable <span
id="fr_4242"></span>[4243](#fn_4242.md) and absurd nature of their
doctrine, and are afraid lest, should they be vanquished, they should
have some difficulty in making good their escape. But if any one
believes in \[only\] one God, who also made all things by the Word, as
Moses likewise says, “God said, Let there be light: and there was
light;” <span id="fr_4243"></span>[4244](#fn_4243.md) and as we read in the
Gospel, “All things were made by Him; and without Him was nothing
made;” <span id="fr_4244"></span>[4245](#fn_4244.md) and the Apostle Paul
\[says\] in like manner, “There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one
God and Father, who is above all, and through all, and in us all” <span
id="fr_4245"></span>[4246](#fn_4245.md) —this man will first of all “hold
the head, from which the whole body is compacted and bound together,
and, through means of every joint according to the measure of the
ministration of each several part, maketh increase of the body to the
edification of itself in love.” <span
id="fr_4246"></span>[4247](#fn_4246.md) And then shall every word also seem
consistent to him, <span id="fr_4247"></span>[4248](#fn_4247.md) if he for
his part diligently read the Scriptures in company with those who are
presbyters in the Church, among whom is the apostolic doctrine, as I
have pointed out.

<span id="ix.vi.xxxiii-p9"></span>2. For all the apostles taught that
there were indeed two testaments among the two peoples; but that it was
one and the same God who appointed both for the advantage of those men
(for whose <span id="fr_4248"></span>[4249](#fn_4248.md) sakes the
testaments were given) who were to believe in God, I have proved in the
third book from the very teaching of the apostles; and that the first
testament was not given without reason, or to no purpose, or in an
accidental sort of manner; but that it subdued <span
id="fr_4249"></span>[4250](#fn_4249.md) those to whom it was given to the
service of God, for their benefit (for God needs no service from men),
and exhibited a type of heavenly things, inasmuch as man was not yet
able to see the things of God through means of immediate vision; <span
id="fr_4250"></span>[4251](#fn_4250.md) and foreshadowed the images of
those things which \[now actually\] exist in the Church, in order that
our faith might be firmly established; <span
id="fr_4251"></span>[4252](#fn_4251.md) and contained a prophecy of things
to come, in order that man might learn that God has foreknowledge of all
things.

<span id="ix.vi.xxxiii-p2"></span> Harvey remarks here, that this can
hardly be the same presbyter mentioned before, “who was only a hearer of
those who had heard the apostles. Irenæus may here mean the venerable
martyr Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna.”
