### <span id="viii.iv.cvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter CVI.—Christ’s resurrection is foretold in the conclusion of the Psalm.

<span id="viii.iv.cvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cvi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.cvi-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cvi-p1.3"></span>“The remainder of the Psalm makes it
manifest that He knew His Father would grant to Him all things which He
asked, and would raise Him from the dead; and that He urged all who fear
God to praise Him because He had compassion on all races of believing
men, through the mystery of Him who was crucified; and that He stood in
the midst of His brethren the apostles (who repented of their flight
from Him when He was crucified, after He rose from the dead, and after
they were persuaded by Himself that, before His passion He had mentioned
to them that He must suffer these things, and that they were announced
beforehand by the prophets), and when living with them sang praises to
God, as is made evident in the memoirs of the apostles. The words are
the following: ‘I will declare Thy name to my brethren; in the midst of
the Church will I praise Thee. Ye that fear the Lord, praise Him; all
ye, the seed of Jacob, glorify Him. Let all the seed of Israel fear
Him.’ And when it is said that He changed the name of one of the
apostles to Peter; and when it is written in the memoirs of Him that
this so happened, as well as that He changed the names of other two
brothers, the sons of Zebedee, to Boanerges, which means sons of
thunder; this was an announcement of the fact that it was He by whom
Jacob was called Israel, and Oshea called Jesus (Joshua), under whose
name the people who survived of those that came from Egypt were
conducted into the land promised to the patriarchs. And that He should
arise like a star from the seed of Abraham, Moses showed before hand
when he thus said, ‘A star shall arise from Jacob, and a leader from
Israel;’ <span id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356.md) and another
Scripture says, ‘Behold a man; the East is His name.’ <span
id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357.md) Accordingly, when a star rose in
heaven at the time of His birth, as is recorded in the memoirs of His
apostles, the Magi from Arabia, recognising the sign by this, came and
worshipped Him.
