### <span id="v.iv.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Be on your guard against the snares of the devil.

<span id="v.iv.viii-p1"></span><span id="v.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Not that
I know there is anything of this kind among you; but I put you on your
guard, inasmuch as I love you greatly, and foresee the snares of the
devil. Wherefore, clothing <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md)
yourselves with meekness, be ye renewed <span
id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md) in faith, that is the flesh of the
Lord, and in love, that is the blood of Jesus Christ. Let no one of you
cherish any grudge against his neighbour. Give no occasion to the
Gentiles, lest by means of a few foolish men the whole multitude \[of
those that believe\] in God be evil spoken of. For, “Woe to him by whose
vanity my name is blasphemed among any.” <span
id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md)

<span id="v.iv.viii-p5"></span>Now I write these things unto you, not
that I know there are any such persons among you; nay, indeed I hope
that God will never permit any such report to reach my ears, He “who
spared not His Son for the sake of His holy Church.” <span
id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) <span id="v.iv.viii-p6.2"></span>But
foreseeing the snares of the wicked one, I arm you beforehand by my
admonitions, as my beloved and faithful children in Christ, furnishing
you with the means of protection <span id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md)
against the deadly disease of unruly men, by which do ye flee from the
disease <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md) \[referred to\] by the
good-will of Christ our Lord. Do ye therefore, clothing <span
id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md) yourselves with meekness, become the
imitators of His sufferings, and of His love, wherewith <span
id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md) He loved us when He gave Himself a
ransom <span id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md) for us, that He might
cleanse us by His blood from our old ungodliness, and bestow life on us
when we were almost on the point of perishing through the depravity that
was in us. Let no one of you, therefore, cherish any grudge against his
neighbour. For says our Lord, “Forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto
you.” <span id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783.md) Give no occasion to the
Gentiles, lest “by means of a few foolish men the word and doctrine \[of
Christ\] be blasphemed.” <span id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md) For
says the prophet, as in the person of God, “Woe to him by whom my name
is blasphemed among the Gentiles.” <span
id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785.md)
