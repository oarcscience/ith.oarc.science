### <span id="iii.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—The blessings that will flow from faith.

<span id="iii.ii.x-p1"></span><span id="iii.ii.x-p1.1"></span><span
id="iii.ii.x-p1.2"></span><span id="iii.ii.x-p1.3"></span>If you also
desire \[to possess\] this faith, you likewise shall receive first of
all the knowledge of the Father. <span id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md)
For God has loved mankind, on whose account He made the world, to whom
He rendered subject all the things that are in it, <span
id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) to whom He gave reason and
understanding, to whom alone He imparted the privilege of looking
upwards to Himself, whom He formed after His own image, to whom He sent
His only-begotten Son, to whom He has promised a kingdom in heaven, and
will give it to those who have loved Him. And when you have attained
this knowledge, with what joy do you think you will be filled? Or, how
will you love Him who has first so loved you? And if you love Him, you
will be an imitator of His kindness. And do not wonder that a man may
become an imitator of God. He can, if he is willing. For it is not by
ruling over his neighbours, or by seeking to hold the supremacy over
those that are weaker, or by being rich, and showing violence towards
those that are inferior, that happiness is found; nor can any one by
these things become an imitator of God. But these things do not at all
constitute His majesty. On the contrary he who takes upon himself the
burden of his neighbour; he who, in whatsoever respect he may be
superior, is ready to benefit another who is deficient; he who,
whatsoever things he has received from God, by distributing these to the
needy, becomes a god to those who receive \[his benefits\]: he is an
imitator of God. Then thou shalt see, while still on earth, that God in
the heavens rules over \[the universe\]; then thou shall begin to speak
the mysteries of God; then shalt thou both love and admire those that
suffer punishment because they will not deny God; then shall thou
condemn the deceit and error of the world when thou shall know what it
is to live truly in heaven, when thou shalt despise that which is here
esteemed to be death, when thou shalt fear what is truly death, which is
reserved for those who shall be condemned to the eternal fire, which
shall afflict those even to the end that are committed to it. Then shalt
thou admire those who for righteousness’ sake endure the fire that is
but for a moment, and shalt count them happy when thou shalt know \[the
nature of\] that fire.

conjecture somewhat different supplements.
