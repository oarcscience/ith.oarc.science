### <span id="iii.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Superstitions of the Jews.

id="iii.ii.iii-p1.2"></span><span id="iii.ii.iii-p1.3"></span>And next,
I imagine that you are most desirous of hearing something on this point,
that the Christians do not observe the same forms of divine worship as
do the Jews. The Jews, then, if they abstain from the kind of service
above described, and deem it proper to worship one God as being Lord of
all, \[are right\]; but if they offer Him worship in the way which we
have described, they greatly err. For while the Gentiles, by offering
such things to those that are destitute of sense and hearing, furnish an
example of madness; they, on the other hand by thinking to offer these
things to God as if He needed them, might justly reckon it rather an act
of folly than of divine worship. For He that made heaven and earth, and
all that is therein, and gives to us all the things of which we stand in
need, certainly requires none of those things which He Himself bestows
on such as think of furnishing them to Him. But those who imagine that,
by means of blood, and the smoke of sacrifices and burnt-offerings, they
offer sacrifices \[acceptable\] to Him, and that by such honours they
show Him respect, —these, by <span id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md)
supposing that they can give anything to Him who stands in need of
nothing, appear to me in no respect to differ from those who studiously
confer the same honour on things destitute of sense, and which therefore
are unable to enjoy such honours.

followed that adopted by most critics.
