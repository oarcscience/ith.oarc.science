### <span id="v.xvii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Salutations. Conclusion.

<span id="v.xvii.xv-p1"></span><span id="v.xvii.xv-p1.1"></span>Philo
and Agathopus the deacons salute you. I salute the company of virgins,
and the order of widows; of whom may I have joy! I salute the people of
the Lord, from the least unto the greatest. I have sent you this letter
through Euphanius the reader, a man honoured of God, and very faithful,
happening to meet with him at Rhegium, just as he was going on board
ship. Remember my bonds <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352) that
I may be made perfect in Christ. Fare ye well in the flesh, the soul,
and the spirit, while ye think of things perfect, and turn yourselves
away from the workers of iniquity, who corrupt the word of truth, and
are strengthened inwardly by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
