### <span id="v.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The same continued.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Wherefore it
is fitting that ye should run together in accordance with the will of
your bishop, which thing also ye do. For your justly renowned
presbytery, worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to the bishop as the
strings are to the harp. Therefore in your <span id="page_51">p.
51</span> <span id="v.ii.iv-Page_51"></span> concord and harmonious
love, Jesus Christ is sung. And do ye, man by man, become a choir, that
being harmonious in love, and taking up the song of God in unison, ye
may with one voice sing to the Father through Jesus Christ, so that He
may both hear you, and perceive by your works that ye are indeed the
members of His Son. It is profitable, therefore, that you should live in
an unblameable unity, that thus ye may always enjoy communion with God.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p2"></span><span id="v.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>Wherefore it
is fitting that ye also should run together in accordance with the will
of the bishop who by God’s appointment <span
id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) rules over you. Which thing ye indeed
of yourselves do, being instructed by the Spirit. For your
justly-renowned presbytery, being worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to
the bishop as the strings are to the harp. Thus, being joined together
in concord and harmonious love, of which Jesus Christ is the Captain and
Guardian, do ye, man by man, become but one choir; so that, agreeing
together in concord, and obtaining <span
id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) a perfect unity with God, ye may
indeed be one in harmonious feeling with God the Father, and His beloved
Son Jesus Christ our Lord. For, says He, “Grant unto them, Holy Father,
that as I and Thou are one, they also may be one in us.” <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md) It is therefore profitable that you,
being joined together with God in an unblameable unity, should be the
followers of the example of Christ, of whom also ye are members.
