### <span id="v.xviii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The same subject continued.

<span id="v.xviii.v-p1"></span>Josiah also, beloved of God, when as yet
he could scarcely speak articulately, convicts those who were possessed
of a wicked spirit as being false in their speech, and deceivers of the
people. He also reveals the deceit of the demons, and openly exposes
those that are no gods; yea, while yet an infant he slays their priests,
and overturns their altars, and defiles the place where sacrifices were
offered with dead bodies, and throws down the temples, and cuts down the
groves, and breaks in pieces the pillars, and breaks open the tombs of
the ungodly, that not a relic of the wicked might any longer
exist. <span id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369.md) To such an extent did
he display zeal in the cause of godliness, and prove himself a punisher
of the ungodly, while he as yet faltered in speech like a child. <span
id="v.xviii.v-p2.2"></span>David, too, who was at once a prophet and a
king, and the root of our Saviour according to the flesh, while yet a
youth is anointed by Samuel to be king. <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370.md) For he himself says in a certain
place, “I was small among my brethren, and the youngest in the house of
my father.” <span id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371.md)
