### <span id="v.viii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Commendation and exhortation.

<span id="v.viii.i-p1"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.viii.i-p1.1"></span>Having</span> obtained good proof that thy
mind is fixed in God as upon an immoveable rock, I loudly glorify \[His
name\] that I have been thought worthy \[to behold\] thy blameless
face, <span id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062) which may I ever enjoy
in God! I entreat thee, by the grace with which thou art clothed, to
press forward in thy course, and to exhort all that they may be saved.
Maintain thy position with all care, both in the flesh and spirit. Have
a regard to preserve unity, than which nothing is better. Bear with all,
even as the Lord does with thee. Support <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063) all in love, as also thou doest.
Give thyself to prayer without ceasing. <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064) Implore additional understanding to
what thou already hast. Be watchful, possessing a sleepless spirit.
Speak to every man separately, as God enables thee. <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065) Bear the infirmities of all, as
being a perfect athlete \[in the Christian life\]: where the labour is
great, the gain is all the more.

mind is fixed in God as upon an immoveable rock, I loudly glorify \[His

in God! I entreat thee, by the grace with which thou art clothed, to

Maintain thy position with all care, both in the flesh and spirit. Have
a regard to preserve unity, than which nothing is better. Bear with all
even as the Lord does with thee. Support <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067) all in love, as also thou doest.
Give thyself to prayer without ceasing. <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068) Implore additional understanding to
what thou already hast. Be watchful, possessing a sleepless spirit.
Speak to every man separately, as God enables thee. <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069) Bear the infirmities of all, as
being a perfect athlete \[in the Christian life\], even as does the Lord
of all. For says \[the Scripture\], “He Himself took our infirmities,
and bare our sicknesses.” <span id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070)
Where the labour is great, the gain is all the more.
