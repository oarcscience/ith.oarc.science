### <span id="viii.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Christians confess their faith in God.

<span id="viii.ii.viii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>And reckon ye that it is for your sakes we
have been saying these things; for it is in our power, when we are
examined, to deny that we are Christians; but we would not live by
telling a lie. <span id="viii.ii.viii-p1.2"></span>For, impelled by the
desire of the eternal and pure life, we seek the abode that is with God,
the Father and Creator of all, and hasten to confess our faith,
persuaded and convinced as we are that they who have proved to God <span
id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779.md) by their works that they followed
Him, and loved to abide with Him where there is no sin to cause
disturbance, can obtain these things. This, then, to speak shortly, is
what we expect and have learned from Christ, and teach. <span
id="viii.ii.viii-p2.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.viii-p2.2"></span>And
Plato, in like manner, used to say that Rhadamanthus and Minos would
punish the wicked who came before them; and we say that the same thing
will be done, but at the hand of Christ, and upon the wicked in the same
bodies united again to their spirits which are now to undergo
everlasting punishment; and not only, as Plato said, for a period of a
thousand years. And if any one say that this is incredible or
impossible, this error of ours is one which concerns ourselves only, and
no other person, so long as you cannot convict us of doing any harm.
