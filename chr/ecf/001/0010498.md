### <span id="viii.iv.xxxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—The same is proved from other Psalms.

id="viii.iv.xxxvii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxxvii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxxvii-p1.3"></span>“Moreover, in the diapsalm of the
forty-sixth Psalm, reference is thus made to Christ: ‘God went up with a
shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet. Sing ye to our God, sing
ye: sing to our King, sing ye; for God is King of all the earth: sing
with understanding. God has ruled over the nations. God sits upon His
holy throne. The rulers of the nations were assembled along with the God
of Abraham, for the strong ones of God are greatly exalted on the
earth.’ <span id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040.md) And in the
ninety-eighth Psalm, the Holy Spirit reproaches you, and predicts Him
whom you do not wish to be king to be King and Lord, both of Samuel, and
of Aaron, and of Moses, and, in short, of all the others. And the words
of the Psalm are these: ‘The Lord has reigned, let the nations be angry:
\[it is\] He who sits upon the cherubim, let the earth be shaken. The
Lord is great in Zion, and He is high above all the nations. Let them
confess Thy great name, for it is fearful and holy, and the honour of
the King loves judgment. Thou hast prepared equity; judgment and
righteousness hast Thou performed in Jacob. Exalt the Lord our God, and
worship the footstool of His feet; for He is holy. Moses and Aaron among
His priests, and Samuel among those who call upon His name. They called
(says the Scripture) on the Lord, and He heard them. In the pillar of
the cloud He spake to them; for <span
id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041.md) they kept His testimonies, and the
commandment which he gave them. O Lord our God, Thou heardest them: O
God, Thou wert propitious to them, and \[yet\] taking vengeance on all
their inventions. Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at His holy hill;
for the Lord our God is holy.’ ” <span
