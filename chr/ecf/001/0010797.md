### <span id="ix.vi.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Proofs from the plain testimony of Moses, and of the other prophets, whose words are the words of Christ, that there is But one God, the founder of the world, whom Our Lord preached, and whom He called His Father.

<span id="ix.vi.iii-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.iii-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.iii-p1.2"></span>Moses, therefore, making a recapitulation of
the whole law, which he had received from the Creator (Demiurge), thus
speaks in Deuteronomy: “Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and
hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.” <span
id="fr_3807"></span>[3808](#fn_3807.md) Again, David saying that his help
came from the Lord, asserts: “My help is from the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.iii-p2.2"></span>Lord</span>, who made
heaven and earth.” <span id="fr_3808"></span>[3809](#fn_3808.md) And Esaias
confesses that words were uttered by God, who made heaven and earth, and
governs them. He says: “Hear, O heavens; and give ear, O earth: for the
<span class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.iii-p3.2"></span>Lord</span> hath
spoken.” <span id="fr_3809"></span>[3810](#fn_3809.md) And again: “Thus
saith the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.iii-p4.2"></span>Lord</span> God, who made the heaven, and
stretched it out; who established the earth, and the things in it; and
who giveth breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them who walk
therein.” <span id="fr_3810"></span>[3811](#fn_3810.md)

<span id="ix.vi.iii-p6"></span>2. Again, our Lord Jesus Christ confesses
this same Being as His Father, where He says: “I <span id="page_464">p.
464</span> <span id="ix.vi.iii-Page_464"></span> confess to thee, O
Father, Lord of heaven and earth.” <span
id="fr_3811"></span>[3812](#fn_3811.md) What Father will those men have us
to understand \[by these words\], those who are most perverse sophists
of Pandora? Whether shall it be Bythus, whom they have fabled of
themselves; or their Mother; or the Only-begotten? Or shall it be he
whom the Marcionites or the others have invented as god (whom I indeed
have amply demonstrated to be no god at all); or shall it be (what is
really the case) the Maker of heaven and earth, whom also the prophets
proclaimed,—whom Christ, too, confesses as His Father,— whom also the
law announces, saying: “Hear, O Israel; The Lord thy God is one
God?” <span id="fr_3812"></span>[3813](#fn_3812.md)

<span id="ix.vi.iii-p9"></span>3. But since the writings (*literæ*) of
Moses are the words of Christ, He does Himself declare to the Jews, as
John has recorded in the Gospel: “If ye had believed Moses, ye would
have believed Me: for he wrote of Me. But if ye believe not his
writings, neither will ye believe My words.” <span
id="fr_3813"></span>[3814](#fn_3813.md) He thus indicates in the clearest
manner that the writings of Moses are His words. If, then, \[this be the
case with regard\] to Moses, so also, beyond a doubt, the words of the
other prophets are His \[words\], as I have pointed out. And again, the
Lord Himself exhibits Abraham as having said to the rich man, with
reference to all those who were still alive: “If they do not obey Moses
and the prophets, neither, if any one were to rise from the dead and go
to them, will they believe him.” <span
id="fr_3814"></span>[3815](#fn_3814.md)

<span id="ix.vi.iii-p12"></span>4. Now, He has not merely related to us
a story respecting a poor man and a rich one; but He has taught us, in
the first place, that no one should lead a luxurious life, nor, living
in worldly pleasures and perpetual feastings, should be the slave of his
lusts, and forget God. “For there was,” He says, “a rich man, who was
clothed in purple and fine linen, and delighted himself with splendid
feasts.” <span id="fr_3815"></span>[3816](#fn_3815.md)

<span id="ix.vi.iii-p14"></span>5. Of such persons, too, the Spirit has
spoken by Esaias: “They drink wine with \[the accompaniment of\] harps,
and tablets, and psalteries, and flutes; but they regard not the works
of God, neither do they consider the work of His hands.” <span
id="fr_3816"></span>[3817](#fn_3816.md) Lest, therefore, we should incur
the same punishment as these men, the Lord reveals \[to us\] their end;
showing at the same time, that if they obeyed Moses and the prophets,
they would believe in Him whom these had preached, the Son of God, who
rose from the dead, and bestows life upon us; and He shows that all are
from one essence, that is, Abraham, and Moses, and the prophets, and
also the Lord Himself, who rose from the dead, in whom many believe who
are of the circumcision, who do also hear Moses and the prophets
announcing the coming of the Son of God. But those who scoff \[at the
truth\] assert that these men were from another essence, and they do not
know the first-begotten from the dead; understanding Christ as a
distinct being, who continued as if He were impassible, and Jesus, who
suffered, as being altogether separate \[from Him\].

<span id="ix.vi.iii-p16"></span>6. For they do not receive from the
Father the knowledge of the Son; neither do they learn who the Father is
from the Son, who teaches clearly and without parables Him who truly is
God. He says: “Swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God’s
throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; neither by Jerusalem,
for it is the city of the great King.” <span
id="fr_3817"></span>[3818](#fn_3817.md) For these words are evidently
spoken with reference to the Creator, as also Esaias says: “Heaven is my
throne, the earth is my footstool.” <span
id="fr_3818"></span>[3819](#fn_3818.md) And besides this Being there is no
other God; otherwise He would not be termed by the Lord either “God” or
“the great King;” for a Being who can be so described admits neither of
any other being compared with nor set above Him. For he who has any
superior over him, and is under the power of another, this being never
can be called either “God” or “the great King.”

<span id="ix.vi.iii-p19"></span>7. But neither will these men be able to
maintain that such words were uttered in an ironical manner, since it is
proved to them by the words themselves that they were in earnest. For He
who uttered them was Truth, and did truly vindicate His own house, by
driving out of it the changers of money, who were buying and selling,
saying unto them: “It is written, My house shall be called the house of
prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.” <span
id="fr_3819"></span>[3820](#fn_3819.md) And what reason had He for thus
doing and saying, and vindicating His house, if He did preach another
God? But \[He did so\], that He might point out the transgressors of His
Father’s law; for neither did He bring any accusation against the house,
nor did He blame the law, which He had come to fulfil; but He reproved
those who were putting His house to an improper use, and those who were
transgressing the law. And therefore the scribes and Pharisees, too, who
from the times of the law had begun to despise God, did not receive His
Word, that is, they did not believe on Christ. Of these Esaias says:
“Thy princes are rebellious, companions of thieves, loving gifts,
following after rewards, not judging the fatherless, and negligent of
the cause of the widows.” <span id="fr_3820"></span>[3821](#fn_3820.md) And
Jeremiah, in like manner: <span id="page_465">p. 465</span> <span
id="ix.vi.iii-Page_465"></span> “They,” he says, “who rule my people did
not know me; they are senseless and imprudent children; they are wise to
do evil, but to do well they have no knowledge.” <span
id="fr_3821"></span>[3822](#fn_3821.md)

<span id="ix.vi.iii-p23"></span>8. But as many as feared God, and were
anxious about His law, these ran to Christ, and were all saved. For He
said to His disciples: “Go ye to the sheep of the house of Israel, <span
id="fr_3822"></span>[3823](#fn_3822.md) which have perished.” And many more
Samaritans, it is said, when the Lord had tarried among them, two days,
“believed because of His words, and said to the woman, Now we believe,
not because of thy saying, for we ourselves have heard \[Him\], and know
that this man is truly the Saviour of the world.” <span
id="fr_3823"></span>[3824](#fn_3823.md) And Paul likewise declares, “And so
all Israel shall be saved;” <span id="fr_3824"></span>[3825](#fn_3824.md)
but he has also said, that the law was our pedagogue \[to bring us\] to
Christ Jesus. <span id="fr_3825"></span>[3826](#fn_3825.md) Let them not
therefore ascribe to the law the unbelief of certain \[among them\]. For
the law never hindered them from believing in the Son of God; nay, but
it even exhorted them <span id="fr_3826"></span>[3827](#fn_3826.md) so to
do, saying <span id="fr_3827"></span>[3828](#fn_3827.md) that men can be
saved in no other way from the old wound of the serpent than by
believing in Him who, in the likeness of sinful flesh, is lifted up from
the earth upon the tree of martyrdom, and draws all things to
Himself, <span id="fr_3828"></span>[3829](#fn_3828.md) and vivifies the
dead.
