### <span id="viii.ix.ix-p0.1"></span>IX.

<span id="viii.ix.ix-p1"></span>The soul can with difficulty be recalled
to those good things from which it has fallen, and <span
id="page_301">p. 301</span> <span id="viii.ix.ix-Page_301"></span> is
with difficulty dragged away from those evils to which it has become
accustomed. If at any time thou showest a disposition to blame thyself,
then perhaps, through the medicine of repentance, I should cherish good
hopes regarding thee. But when thou altogether despisest fear, and
rejectest with scorn the very faith of Christ, it were better for thee
that thou hadst never been born from the womb.—*From the writings of*
<span class="upper"><span id="viii.ix.ix-p1.1"></span>John of
Damascus</span>.
