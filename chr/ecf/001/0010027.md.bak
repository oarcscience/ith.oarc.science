### <span id="ii.ii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—These exhortations are confirmed by the Christian faith, which proclaims the misery of sinful conduct.

<span id="ii.ii.xxii-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Now
the faith which is in Christ confirms all these \[admonitions\]. For He
Himself by the Holy Ghost thus addresses us: “Come, ye children, hearken
unto Me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord. What man is he that
desireth life, and loveth to see good days? Keep thy tongue from evil,
and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek
peace, and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and
His ears are \[open\] unto their prayers. The face of the Lord is
against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the
earth. The righteous cried, and the Lord heard him, and delivered him
out of all his troubles.” <span id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) “Many are
the stripes \[appointed for\] the wicked; but mercy shall compass those
about who hope in the Lord.” <span id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md)
