### <span id="v.iii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Caution against false doctrines.

<span id="v.iii.viii-p1"></span><span id="v.iii.viii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.viii-p1.2"></span><span id="v.iii.viii-p1.3"></span>Be not
deceived with strange doctrines, nor with old fables, which are
unprofitable. <span id="v.iii.viii-p1.4"></span>For if we still live
according to the Jewish law, we acknowledge that we have not received
grace. For the divinest prophets lived according to Christ Jesus. <span
id="v.iii.viii-p1.5"></span><span id="v.iii.viii-p1.6"></span>On this
account also they were persecuted, being inspired by His grace to fully
convince the unbelieving that there is one God, who has manifested
Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His eternal Word, not proceeding
forth from silence, <span id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) and who in
all things pleased Him that sent Him.

<span id="v.iii.viii-p3"></span><span id="v.iii.viii-p3.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.viii-p3.2"></span><span id="v.iii.viii-p3.3"></span><span
id="v.iii.viii-p3.4"></span>Be not deceived with strange doctrines, “nor
give heed to fables and endless genealogies,” <span
id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) and things in which the Jews make
their boast. “Old things are passed away: behold, all things have become
new.” <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) For if we still live
according to the Jewish law, and the circumcision of the flesh, we deny
that we have received grace. For the divinest prophets lived according
to Jesus Christ. <span id="v.iii.viii-p5.2"></span>On this account also
they were persecuted, being inspired by grace to fully convince the
unbelieving that there is one God, the Almighty, who has manifested
Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His Word, not spoken, but
essential. For He is not the voice of an articulate utterance, but a
substance begotten by divine power, who has in all things pleased Him
that sent Him. <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md)

<span id="v.iii.viii-p2"></span> Some have argued that the Gnostic <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.viii-p2.1"></span>Σιγή</span>, *silence*,
is here referred to, and have consequently inferred that this epistle
could not have been written by Ignatius.
