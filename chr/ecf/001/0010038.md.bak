### <span id="ii.ii.xxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—But let us not give up the practice of good works and love. God Himself is an example to us of good works.

<span id="ii.ii.xxxiii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxxiii-p1.2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxiii-p1.3"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxxiii-p1.4"></span>What
shall we do, then, brethren? Shall we become slothful in well-doing, and
cease from the practice of love? God forbid that any such course should
be followed by us! But rather let us hasten with all energy and
readiness of mind to perform every good work. For the Creator and Lord
of all Himself rejoices in His works. For by His infinitely great power
He established the heavens, and by His incomprehensible wisdom He
adorned them. He also divided the earth from the water which surrounds
it, and fixed it upon the immoveable foundation of His own will. The
animals also which are upon it He commanded by His own word <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) into existence. So likewise, when He
had formed the sea, and the living creatures which are in it, He
enclosed them \[within their proper bounds\] by His own power. Above
all, <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) with His holy and undefiled
hands He formed man, the most excellent \[of His creatures\], and truly
great through the understanding given him— the express likeness of His
own image. For <span id="page_14">p. 14</span> <span
id="ii.ii.xxxiii-Page_14"></span> thus says God: “Let us make man in Our
image, and after Our likeness. So God made man; male and female He
created them.” <span id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) Having thus
finished all these things, He approved them, and blessed them, and said,
“Increase and multiply.” <span id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) We
see, <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) then, how all righteous men
have been adorned with good works, and how the Lord Himself, adorning
Himself with His works, rejoiced. Having therefore such an example, let
us without delay accede to His will, and let us work the work of
righteousness with our whole strength.
