### <span id="v.viii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Exhortations.

<span id="v.viii.iv-p1"></span><span id="v.viii.iv-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.viii.iv-p1.2"></span>Let not widows be neglected. Be thou, after
the Lord, their protector <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) and
friend. Let nothing be done without thy consent; neither do thou
anything without the approval of God, which indeed thou dost not,
inasmuch as thou art stedfast. Let your assembling together be of
frequent <span id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) occurrence: seek
after all by name. <span id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) <span
id="v.viii.iv-p4.1"></span>Do not despise either male or female slaves,
yet neither let them be puffed up with conceit, but rather let them
<span id="page_95">p. 95</span> <span id="v.viii.iv-Page_95"></span>
submit themselves <span id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md) the more,
for the glory of God, that they may obtain from God a better liberty.
Let them not long to be set free \[from slavery\] at the public expense,
that they be not found slaves to their own desires.

<span id="v.viii.iv-p6"></span><span id="v.viii.iv-p6.1"></span><span
id="v.viii.iv-p6.2"></span>Let not the widows be neglected. Be thou,
after the Lord, their protector and friend. Let nothing be done without
thy consent; neither do thou anything without the approval of God, which
indeed thou doest not. Be thou stedfast. Let your assembling together be
of frequent <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md) occurrence: seek
after all by name. <span id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md) <span
id="v.viii.iv-p8.1"></span>Do not despise either male or female slaves,
yet neither let them be puffed up with conceit, but rather let them
submit themselves <span id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md) the more,
for the glory of God, that they may obtain from God a better liberty.
Let them not wish to be set free \[from slavery\] at the public expense,
that they be not found slaves to their own desires.
