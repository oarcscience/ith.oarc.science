### <span id="v.vii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Christ’s true passion.

<span id="v.vii.ii-p1"></span><span id="v.vii.ii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.vii.ii-p1.2"></span>Now, He suffered all these things for our
sakes, that we might be saved. And He suffered truly, even as also He
truly raised up Himself, not, as certain unbelievers maintain, that He
only seemed to suffer, as they themselves only seem to be
\[Christians\]. And as they believe, so shall it happen unto them, when
they shall be divested of their bodies, and be mere evil spirits. <span

<span id="v.vii.ii-p3"></span><span id="v.vii.ii-p3.1"></span><span
id="v.vii.ii-p3.2"></span><span id="v.vii.ii-p3.3"></span>Now, He
suffered all these things for us; and He suffered them really, and not
in appearance only, even as also He truly rose again. But not, as some
of the unbelievers, who are ashamed of the formation of man, and the
cross, and death itself, affirm, that in appearance only, and not in
truth, He took a body of the Virgin, and suffered only in appearance,
forgetting, as they do, Him who said, “The Word was made flesh;” <span
id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984.md) and again, “Destroy this temple, and
in three days I will raise it up;” <span
id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985.md) and once more, “If I be lifted up from
the earth, I will draw all men unto Me.” <span
id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986.md) The Word therefore did dwell in flesh,
for “Wisdom built herself an house.” <span
id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987.md) The Word raised up again His own
temple on the third day, when it had been destroyed by the Jews fighting
against Christ. The Word, when His flesh was lifted up, after the manner
of the brazen serpent in the wilderness, drew all men to Himself for
their eternal salvation. <span id="fr_988"></span>[989](#fn_988.md)
