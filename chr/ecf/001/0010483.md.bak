### <span id="viii.iv.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—So also were sacrifices and oblations.

<span id="viii.iv.xxii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>“And that you may learn that it was for
the sins of your own nation, and for their idolatries and not because
there was any necessity for such sacrifices, that they were likewise
enjoined, listen to the manner in which He speaks of these by Amos, one
of the twelve, saying: ‘Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord! to
what end is this day of the Lord for you? It is darkness and not light,
as when a man flees from the face of a lion, and a bear meets him; and
he goes into his house, and leans his hands against the wall, and the
serpent bites him. Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness and not
light, even very dark, and no brightness in it? I have hated, I have
despised your feast-days, and I will not smell in your solemn
assemblies: wherefore, though ye offer Me your burnt-offerings and
sacrifices, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the
peace-offerings of your presence. Take thou away from Me the multitude
of thy songs and psalms; I will not hear thine instruments. But let
judgment be rolled down as water, and righteousness as an impassable
torrent. Have ye offered unto Me victims and sacrifices in the
wilderness, O house of Israel? saith the Lord. And have ye taken up the
tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Raphan, the figures which
ye made for yourselves? And I will carry you away beyond Damascus, saith
the Lord, whose name is the Almighty God. Woe to them that are at ease
in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria: those who are named among
the chiefs have plucked away the first-fruits of the nations: the house
of Israel have entered for themselves. Pass all of you unto Calneh, and
see; and from thence go ye unto Hamath the great, and go down thence to
Gath of the strangers, the noblest of all these kingdoms, if their
boundaries are greater than your boundaries. Ye who come to the evil
day, who are approaching, and who hold to false Sabbaths; who lie on
beds of ivory, and are at ease upon their couches; who eat the lambs out
of the flock, and the sucking calves out of the midst of the herd; who
applaud at the sound of the musical instruments; they reckon them as
stable, and not as fleeting, who drink wine in bowls, and anoint
themselves with the chief ointments, but they are not grieved for the
affliction of Joseph. Wherefore now they shall be captives, among the
first of the nobles who are carried away; and the house of evil-doers
shall be removed, and the neighing of horses shall be taken away from
Ephraim.’ <span id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000.md) And again by
Jeremiah: ‘Collect your flesh, and sacrifices, and eat: for concerning
neither sacrifices nor libations did I command your fathers in the day
in which I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt.’ <span
id="fr_2001"></span>[2002](#fn_2001.md) And again by David, in the
forty-ninth Psalm, He thus said: ‘The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken,
and called the earth, from the rising of the sun unto the going down
thereof. Out of Zion is the perfection of His beauty. God, even our God,
shall come openly, and shall not keep silence. Fire shall burn before
Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him. He shall call to
the heavens above, and to the earth, that He may judge His people.
Assemble to Him His saints; those that have made a covenant with Him by
sacrifices. And the heavens shall declare His righteousness, for God is
judge. Hear, O My people, and I will speak to thee; O Israel, and I will
testify to thee, I am God, even thy God. I will not reprove thee for thy
sacrifices; thy burnt-offerings are continually before me. I will take
no bullocks out of thy house, nor he-goats out of thy folds: for all the
beasts of the field are Mine, the herds and the oxen on the mountains. I
know all the fowls of the heavens, and the beauty of the field is Mine.
If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world is Mine, and the
fulness thereof. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of
goats? Offer unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows unto the
Most High, and call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify Me. But unto the wicked God saith, What
hast thou to do to declare My statutes, and to take My covenant into thy
mouth? But thou hast hated instruction, and cast My words behind thee.
When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him; and hast been
partaker with the adulterer. Thy mouth has framed evil, and thy tongue
has enfolded deceit. Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou
slanderest thine own mother’s son. These things hast thou done, and I
kept silence; thou thoughtest that I would be like thyself in
wickedness. I will reprove thee, and set thy sins in order before thine
eyes. Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest He tear you in pieces,
and there be none to deliver. The <span id="page_206">p. 206</span>
<span id="viii.iv.xxii-Page_206"></span> sacrifice of praise shall
glorify Me; and there is the way in which I shall show him My
salvation.’ <span id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002.md) Accordingly He
neither takes sacrifices from you nor commanded them at first to be
offered because they are needful to Him, but because of your sins. For
indeed the temple, which is called the temple in Jerusalem, He admitted
to be His house or court, not as though He needed it, but in order that
you, in this view of it, giving yourselves to Him, might not worship
idols. And that this is so, Isaiah says: ‘What house have ye built Me?
saith the Lord. Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool.’ <span
