### <span id="vi.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The red heifer a type of Christ.

<span id="vi.ii.viii-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.viii-p1.1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.viii-p1.2"></span>Now what do you suppose this to be a type
of, that a command was given to Israel, that men of the greatest
wickedness <span id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540) should offer a
heifer, and slay and burn it, and, that then boys should take the ashes,
and put these into vessels, and bind round a stick <span
id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541) purple wool along with hyssop, and
that thus the boys should sprinkle the people, one by one, in order that
they might be purified from their sins? Consider how He speaks to you
with simplicity. The calf <span id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542) is
Jesus: the sinful men offering it are those who led Him to the
slaughter. But now the men are no longer guilty, are no longer regarded
as sinners. <span id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543) <span
id="vi.ii.viii-p5.1"></span>And the boys that sprinkle are those that
have proclaimed to us the remission of sins and purification of heart.
To these He gave authority to preach the Gospel, being twelve in number,
corresponding to the twelve tribes <span
id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544) of Israel. But why are there three
boys that sprinkle? To correspond <span
id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545) to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
because these were great with God. And why was the wool \[placed\] upon
the wood? Because by wood Jesus holds His kingdom, so that \[through the
cross\] those believing on Him shall live for ever. <span
id="vi.ii.viii-p7.1"></span>But why was hyssop joined with the wool?
Because in His kingdom the days will be evil and polluted in which we
shall be saved, \[and\] because he who suffers in body is cured through
the cleansing <span id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546) efficacy of
hyssop. And on this account the things which stand thus are clear to us,
but obscure to them because they did not hear the voice of the Lord.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1540"></span>[142:1541](0010344.htm#fr_1540) <span
id="vi.ii.viii-p1.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.viii-p2"></span> Literally, “men in whom sins are
perfect.” Of this, and much more that follows, no mention is made in
Scripture.

<span id="fn_1541"></span>[142:1542](0010344.htm#fr_1541) <span
id="vi.ii.viii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.viii-p3"></span> Cod. Sin. has “upon sticks,” and adds,
“Behold again the type of the cross, both the scarlet wool and the
hyssop,”—adopted by Hilgenfeld.

<span id="fn_1542"></span>[142:1543](0010344.htm#fr_1542) <span
id="vi.ii.viii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.viii-p4"></span> Cod. Sin. has, “the law is Christ
Jesus,” corrected to the above.

<span id="fn_1543"></span>[142:1544](0010344.htm#fr_1543) <span
id="vi.ii.viii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.viii-p5"></span> The Greek text is, “then no longer
\[sinful\] men, no longer the glory of sinners,” which Dressel defends
and Hilgenfeld adopts, but which is surely corrupt.

<span id="fn_1544"></span>[142:1545](0010344.htm#fr_1544) <span
id="vi.ii.viii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.viii-p6"></span> Literally, “in witness of the tribes.”

<span id="fn_1545"></span>[142:1546](0010344.htm#fr_1545) <span
id="vi.ii.viii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.viii-p7"></span> “In witness of.”

<span id="fn_1546"></span>[142:1547](0010344.htm#fr_1546) <span
id="vi.ii.viii-p7.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.viii-p8"></span> Thus the sense seems to require, and
thus Dressel translates, though it is difficult to extract such a
meaning from the Greek text.
