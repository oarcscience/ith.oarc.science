### <span id="viii.iv.cxxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXXVI.—The Jews, in rejecting Christ, rejected God who sent him.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxxvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxxvi-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxxvi-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxxvi-p1.3"></span>“For you see how He now addresses the
people, saying a little before: ‘As the grape shall be found in the
cluster, and they will say, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it; so
will I do for My servant’s sake: for His sake I will not destroy them
all.’ <span id="fr_2473"></span>[2474](#fn_2473) And thereafter He adds:
‘And I shall bring forth the seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah.’ It is
plain then that if He thus be angry with them, and threaten to leave
very few <span id="page_268">p. 268</span> <span
id="viii.iv.cxxxvi-Page_268"></span> of them, He promises to bring forth
certain others, who shall dwell in His mountain. But these are the
persons whom He said He would sow and beget. For you neither suffer Him
when He calls you, nor hear Him when He speaks to you, but have done
evil in the presence of the Lord. But the highest pitch of your
wickedness lies in this, that you hate the Righteous One, and slew Him;
and so treat those who have received from Him all that they are and
have, and who are pious, righteous, and humane. Therefore ‘woe unto
their soul,’ says the Lord, <span id="fr_2474"></span>[2475](#fn_2474)
‘for they have devised an evil counsel against themselves, saying, Let
us take away the righteous, for he is distasteful to us.’ For indeed you
are not in the habit of sacrificing to Baal, as were your fathers, or of
placing cakes in groves and on high places for the host of heaven: but
you have not accepted God’s Christ. For he who knows not Him, knows not
the will of God; and he who insults and hates Him, insults and hates Him
that sent Him. And whoever believes not in Him, believes not the
declarations of the prophets, who preached and proclaimed Him to all.
