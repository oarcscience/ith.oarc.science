### <span id="ix.vi.xlii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLI.—Those persons who do not believe in God, but who are disobedient, are angels and sons of the devil, not indeed by nature, but by imitation. Close of this book, and scope of the succeeding one.

<span id="ix.vi.xlii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vi.xlii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.vi.xlii-p1.2"></span>Inasmuch
as the Lord has said that there are certain angels, \[viz. those\] of
the devil, for whom eternal fire is prepared; and as, again, He declares
with regard to the tares, “The tares are the children of the wicked
one,” <span id="fr_4435"></span>[4436](#fn_4435.md) it must be affirmed
that He has ascribed all who are of the apostasy to him who is the
ringleader of this transgression. But He made neither angels nor men so
by nature. For we do not find that the devil created anything
whatsoever, since indeed he is himself a creature of God, like the other
angels. For God made all things, as also David says with regard to all
things of the kind: “For He spake the word, and they were made; He
commanded, and they were created.” <span
id="fr_4436"></span>[4437](#fn_4436.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xlii-p4"></span>2. Since, therefore, all things were
made by God, and since the devil has become the cause of apostasy to
himself and others, justly does the Scripture always term those who
remain in a state of apostasy “sons of the devil” and “angels of the
wicked one” (*maligni*). <span id="ix.vi.xlii-p4.1"></span>For \[the
word\] “son,” as one before me has observed, has a twofold meaning: one
\[is a son\] in the order of nature, because he was born a son; the
other, in that he was made so, is reputed a son, although there be a
difference between being born so and being made so. For the first is
indeed born from the person referred to; but the second is made so by
him, whether as respects his creation or by the teaching of his
doctrine. For when any person has been taught from the mouth of another,
he is termed the son of him who instructs him, and the latter \[is
called\] his father. According to nature, then—that is, according to
creation, so to speak— we are all sons of God, because we have all been
created by God. But with respect to obedience <span id="page_525">p.
525</span> <span id="ix.vi.xlii-Page_525"></span> and doctrine we are
not all the sons of God: those only are so who believe in Him and do His
will. And those who do not believe, and do not obey His will, are sons
and angels of the devil, because they do the works of the devil. And
that such is the case He has declared in Isaiah: “I have begotten and
brought up children, but they have rebelled against Me.” <span
id="fr_4437"></span>[4438](#fn_4437.md) And again, where He says that these
children are aliens: “Strange children have lied unto Me.” <span
id="fr_4438"></span>[4439](#fn_4438.md) According to nature, then, they are
\[His\] children, because they have been so created; but with regard to
their works, they are not His children.

<span id="ix.vi.xlii-p7"></span>3. For as, among men, those sons who
disobey their fathers, being disinherited, are still their sons in the
course of nature, but by law are disinherited, for they do not become
the heirs of their natural parents; so in the same way is it with
God,—those who do not obey Him being disinherited by Him, have ceased to
be His sons. Wherefore they cannot receive His inheritance: as David
says, “Sinners are alienated from the womb; their anger is after the
likeness of a serpent.” <span id="fr_4439"></span>[4440](#fn_4439.md) And
therefore did the Lord term those whom He knew to be the offspring of
men “a generation of vipers;” <span id="fr_4440"></span>[4441](#fn_4440.md)
because after the manner of these animals they go about in subtilty, and
injure others. For He said, “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and
of the Sadducees.” <span id="fr_4441"></span>[4442](#fn_4441.md) Speaking
of Herod, too, He says, “Go ye and tell that fox,” <span
id="fr_4442"></span>[4443](#fn_4442.md) aiming at his wicked cunning and
deceit. Wherefore the prophet David says, “Man, being placed in honour,
is made like unto cattle.” <span id="fr_4443"></span>[4444](#fn_4443.md)
And again Jeremiah says, “They are become like horses, furious about
females; each one neighed after his neighbour’s wife.” <span
id="fr_4444"></span>[4445](#fn_4444.md) And Isaiah, when preaching in
Judea, and reasoning with Israel, termed them “rulers of Sodom” and
“people of Gomorrah;” <span id="fr_4445"></span>[4446](#fn_4445.md)
intimating that they were like the Sodomites in wickedness, and that the
same description of sins was rife among them, calling them by the same
name, because of the similarity of their conduct. And inasmuch as they
were not by nature so created by God, but had power also to act rightly,
the same person said to them, giving them good counsel, “Wash ye, make
you clean; take away iniquity from your souls before mine eyes; cease
from your iniquities.” <span id="fr_4446"></span>[4447](#fn_4446.md) Thus,
no doubt, since they had transgressed and sinned in the same manner, so
did they receive the same reproof as did the Sodomites. But when they
should be converted and come to repentance, and cease from evil, they
should have power to become the sons of God, and to receive the
inheritance of immortality which is given by Him. <span
id="ix.vi.xlii-p15.2"></span><span id="ix.vi.xlii-p15.3"></span>For this
reason, therefore, He has termed those “angels of the devil,” and
“children of the wicked one,” <span id="fr_4447"></span>[4448](#fn_4447.md)
who give heed to the devil, and do his works. But these are, at the same
time, all created by the one and the same God. When, however, they
believe and are subject to God, and go on and keep His doctrine, they
are the sons of God; but when they have apostatized and fallen into
transgression, they are ascribed to their chief, the devil—to him who
first became the cause of apostasy to himself, and afterwards to others.

<span id="ix.vi.xlii-p17"></span>4. Inasmuch as the words of the Lord
are numerous, while they all proclaim one and the same Father, the
Creator of this world, it was incumbent also upon me, for their own
sake, to refute by many \[arguments\] those who are involved in many
errors, if by any means, when they are confuted by many \[proofs\], they
may be converted to the truth and saved. But it is necessary to subjoin
to this composition, in what follows, also the doctrine of Paul after
the words of the Lord, to examine the opinion of this man, and expound
the apostle, and to explain whatsoever \[passages\] have received other
interpretations from the heretics, who have altogether misunderstood
what Paul has spoken, and to point out the folly of their mad opinions;
and to demonstrate from that same Paul, from whose \[writings\] they
press questions upon us, that they are indeed utterers of falsehood, but
that the apostle was a preacher of the truth, and that he taught all
things agreeable to the preaching of the truth; \[to the effect that\]
it was one God the Father who spake with Abraham, who gave the law, who
sent the prophets beforehand, who in the last times sent His Son, and
conferred salvation upon His own handiwork —that is, the substance of
flesh. Arranging, then, in another book, the rest of the words of the
Lord, which He taught concerning the Father not by parables, but by
expressions taken in their obvious meaning (*sed simpliciter ipsis
dictionibus*), and the exposition of the Epistles of the blessed
apostle, I shall, with God’s aid, furnish thee with the complete work of
the exposure and refutation of knowledge, falsely so called; thus
practising myself and thee in \[these\] five books for presenting
opposition to all heretics.
