### <span id="viii.ii.liv-p0.1"></span>Chapter LIV.—Origin of heathen mythology.

<span id="viii.ii.liv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.liv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.liv-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.ii.liv-p1.3"></span><span id="viii.ii.liv-p1.4"></span><span
id="viii.ii.liv-p1.5"></span>But those who hand down the myths which the
poets have made, adduce no proof to the youths who learn them; and we
proceed to demonstrate that they have been uttered by the influence of
the wicked demons, to deceive and lead astray the human race. For having
heard it proclaimed through the prophets that the Christ was to come,
and that the ungodly among men were to be punished by fire, they put
forward many to be called sons of Jupiter, under the impression that
they would be able to produce in men the idea that the things which were
said with regard to Christ were mere marvellous tales, like the things
which were said by the poets. And these things were said both among the
Greeks and among all nations where they \[the demons\] heard the
prophets foretelling that Christ would specially be believed in; but
that in hearing what was said by the prophets they did not accurately
understand it, but imitated what was said of our Christ, like men who
are in error, we will make plain. The prophet Moses, then, was, as we
have already said, older than all writers; and by him, as we have also
said before, it was thus predicted: “There shall not fail a prince from
Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until He come for whom it
is reserved; and He shall be the desire of the Gentiles, binding His
foal to the vine, washing His robe in the blood of the grape.” <span
id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881) The devils, accordingly, when they
heard these prophetic words, said that Bacchus was the son of Jupiter,
and gave out that he was the discoverer of the vine, and they number
wine <span id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882) \[or, the ass\] among
his mysteries; and they taught that, having been torn in pieces, he
ascended into heaven. And because in the prophecy of Moses it had not
been expressly intimated whether He who was to come was the Son of God,
and whether He would, riding on the foal, remain on earth or ascend into
heaven, and because the name of “foal” could mean either the foal of an
ass or the foal of a horse, they, not knowing whether He who was
foretold would bring the foal of an ass or of a horse as the sign of His
coming, nor whether He was the Son of God, as we said above, or of man,
gave out that Bellerophon, a man born of man, himself ascended to heaven
on his horse Pegasus. And when they heard it said by the other prophet
Isaiah, that He should be born of a virgin, and by His own means ascend
into heaven, they pretended that Perseus was spoken of. And when they
knew what was said, as has been cited above, in the prophecies written
aforetime, “Strong as a giant to run his course,” <span
id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883) they said that Hercules was strong,
and had journeyed over the whole earth. And when, again, they learned
that it had been foretold that He should heal every sickness, and raise
the dead, they produced Æsculapius.

<span id="viii.ii.liv-p3"></span> In the <span class="upper"><span
id="viii.ii.liv-p3.1"></span>ms.</span> the reading is <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.liv-p3.2"></span>οἶνον</span> (wine);
but as Justin’s argument seems to require <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.liv-p3.3"></span>ὄνον</span> (an ass), Sylburg inserted this
latter word in his edition; and this reading is approved by Grabe and
Thirlby, and adopted by Otto and Trollope. It may be added, that <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.liv-p3.4"></span>ἀναγράφουσι</span> is
much more suitable to <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.liv-p3.5"></span>ὄνον</span> than to <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.liv-p3.6"></span>οἶνον</span>.
