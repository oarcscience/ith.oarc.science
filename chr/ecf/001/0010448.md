### <span id="viii.iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Justin accuses Crescens of ignorant prejudice against the Christians.

<span id="viii.iii.iii-p1"></span><span id="viii.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>I
too, therefore, expect to be plotted against and fixed to the stake, by
some of those I have named, or perhaps by Crescens, that lover of
bravado and boasting; <span id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929.md) for the
man is not worthy of the name of philosopher who publicly bears witness
against us in matters which he does not understand, saying that the
Christians are atheists and impious, and doing so to win favour with the
deluded mob, and to please them. For if he assails us without having
read the teachings of Christ, he is thoroughly depraved, and far worse
than the illiterate, who often refrain from discussing or bearing false
witness about matters they do not understand. Or, if he has read them
and does not understand the majesty that is in them, or, understanding
it, acts thus that he may not be suspected of being such \[a
Christian\], he is far more base and thoroughly depraved, being
conquered by illiberal and unreasonable opinion and fear. For I would
have you to know that I proposed to him certain questions on this
subject, and interrogated him, and found most convincingly that he, in
truth, knows nothing. And to prove that I speak the truth, I am ready,
if these disputations have not been reported to you, to conduct them
again in your presence. And this would be an act worthy of a prince. But
if my questions and his answers have been made known to you, you are
already aware that he is acquainted with none of our matters; or, if he
is acquainted with them, but, through fear of those who might hear him,
does not dare to speak out, like Socrates, he proves himself, as I said
before, no philosopher, but an opinionative man; <span
id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930.md) at least he does not regard that
Socratic and most admirable saying: “But a man must in no wise be
honoured before the truth.” <span id="fr_1931"></span>[1932](#fn_1931.md)
But it is impossible for a Cynic, who makes indifference his end, to
know any good but indifference.
