<p> <a name="viii.iv.lxxii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.iv.lxxii-p0.1"></A>Chapter LXXII.&#8212;Passages have been removed by the Jews from Esdras and Jeremiah.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.lxxii-p1"></A>And I said, &#8220;I shall do as you please. From the statements, then, which Esdras made in reference to the law of the passover, they have taken away the following: &#145;And Esdras said to the people, This passover is our Saviour and our refuge. And if you have understood, and your heart has taken it in, that we shall humble Him on a standard, and&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2217"></A><A HREF="#fn_2217"><FONT SIZE="1">2218</FONT></A>
 thereafter hope in Him, then this place shall not be forsaken for ever, says the God of hosts. But if you will not believe Him, and will not listen to His declaration, you shall be a laughing-stock to the nations.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2218"></A><A HREF="#fn_2218"><FONT SIZE="1">2219</FONT></A>
 And from the sayings of Jeremiah they have cut out the following: &#145;I [was] like a lamb that is brought to the slaughter: they devised a device against me, saying, Come, let us lay on wood on His bread, and let us blot Him out from the land of the living; and His name shall no more be remembered.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2219"></A><A HREF="#fn_2219"><FONT SIZE="1">2220</FONT></A>
 <a name="viii.iv.lxxii-p4.2"></A>And since this passage from the sayings of Jeremiah is still written in some copies  <A NAME="page_235"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 235</FONT></A> <a name="viii.iv.lxxii-Page_235"></A>  [of the Scriptures] in the synagogues of the Jews (for it is only a short time since they were cut out), and since from these words it is demonstrated that the Jews deliberated about the Christ Himself, to crucify and put Him to death, He Himself is both declared to be led as a sheep to the slaughter, as was predicted by Isaiah, and is here represented as a harmless lamb; but being in a difficulty about them, they give themselves over to blasphemy. And again, from the sayings of the same Jeremiah these have been cut out: &#145;The Lord God remembered His dead people of Israel who lay in the graves; and He descended to preach to them His own salvation.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2220"></A><A HREF="#fn_2220"><FONT SIZE="1">2221</FONT></A>
