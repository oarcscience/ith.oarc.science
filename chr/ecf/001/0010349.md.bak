### <span id="vi.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Christians, and not Jews, the heirs of the covenant.

<span id="vi.ii.xiii-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p1.2"></span><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p1.3"></span>But let us
see if this people <span id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629.md) is the
heir, or the former, and if the covenant belongs to us or to them. Hear
ye now what the Scripture saith concerning the people. Isaac prayed for
Rebecca his wife, because she was barren; and she conceived. <span
id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md) Furthermore also, Rebecca went
forth to inquire of the Lord; and the Lord said to her, “Two nations are
in thy womb, and two peoples in thy belly; and the one people shall
surpass the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.” <span
id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631.md) You ought to understand who was
Isaac, who Rebecca, and concerning what persons He declared that this
people should be greater than that. And in another prophecy Jacob speaks
more clearly to his son Joseph, saying, “Behold, the Lord hath not
deprived me of thy presence; bring thy sons to me, that I may bless
them.” <span id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md) And he brought
Manasseh and Ephraim, desiring that Manasseh <span
id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md) should be blessed, because he was
the elder. With this view Joseph led him to the right hand of his father
Jacob. But Jacob saw in spirit the type of the people to arise
afterwards. And what says \[the Scripture\]? And Jacob changed the
direction of his hands, and laid his right hand upon the head of
Ephraim, the second and younger, and blessed him. And Joseph said to
Jacob, “Transfer thy right hand to the head of Manasseh, <span
id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md) for he is my first-born son.” <span
id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) And Jacob said, “I know it, my son,
I know it; but the elder shall serve the younger: yet he also shall be
blessed.” <span id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md) Ye see on whom he
laid <span id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) \[his hands\], that this
people should be first, and <span id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span
id="vi.ii.xiii-Page_146"></span> heir of the covenant. If then, still
further, the same thing was intimated through Abraham, we reach the
perfection of our knowledge. What, then, says He to Abraham? “Because
thou hast believed, <span id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md) it is
imputed to thee for righteousness: behold, I have made thee the father
of those nations who believe in the Lord while in \[a state of\]
uncircumcision.” <span id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md)
