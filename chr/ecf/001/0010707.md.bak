### <span id="ix.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Unity of the faith of the Church throughout the whole world.

<span id="ix.ii.xi-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.ii.xi-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.ii.xi-p1.2"></span>The Church, though dispersed through our the
whole world, even to the ends of the earth, has received from the
apostles and their disciples this faith: \[She believes\] in one God,
the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all
things that are in them; and in one Christ Jesus, the Son of God, who
became incarnate for our salvation; and in the Holy Spirit, who
proclaimed through the prophets the dispensations <span
id="fr_2785"></span>[2786](#fn_2785.md) of God, and the advents, and the
birth from a virgin, and the passion, and the resurrection from the
dead, and the ascension into heaven in the flesh of the beloved Christ
Jesus, our Lord, and His \[future\] manifestation from heaven in the
glory of the Father “to gather all things in one,” <span
id="fr_2786"></span>[2787](#fn_2786.md) and to raise up anew all flesh of
the whole human race, in order that to Christ Jesus, our Lord, and God,
and Saviour, and King, according to the will of the invisible Father,
“every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and
things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess” <span
id="fr_2787"></span>[2788](#fn_2787.md) to Him, and that He should execute
just judgment towards all; that He may send “spiritual
wickednesses,” <span id="fr_2788"></span>[2789](#fn_2788.md) and <span
id="page_331">p. 331</span> <span id="ix.ii.xi-Page_331"></span> the
angels who transgressed and became apostates, together with the ungodly,
and unrighteous, and wicked, and profane among men, into everlasting
fire; but may, in the exercise of His grace, confer immortality on the
righteous, and holy, and those who have kept His commandments, and have
persevered in His love, some from the beginning \[of their Christian
course\], and others from \[the date of\] their repentance, and may
surround them with everlasting glory.

<span id="ix.ii.xi-p6"></span>2. As I have already observed, the Church,
having received this preaching and this faith, although scattered
throughout the whole world, yet, as if occupying but one house,
carefully preserves it. She also believes these points \[of doctrine\]
just as if she had but one soul, and one and the same heart, and she
proclaims them, and teaches them, and hands them down, with perfect
harmony, as if she possessed only one mouth. For, although the languages
of the world are dissimilar, yet the import of the tradition is one and
the same. For the Churches which have been planted in Germany do not
believe or hand down anything different, nor do those in Spain, nor
those in Gaul, nor those in the East, nor those in Egypt, nor those in
Libya, nor those which have been established in the central
regions <span id="fr_2789"></span>[2790](#fn_2789.md) of the world. But as
the sun, that creature of God, is one and the same throughout the whole
world, so also the preaching of the truth shineth everywhere, and
enlightens all men that are willing to come to a knowledge of the truth.
Nor will any one of the rulers in the Churches, however highly gifted he
may be in point of eloquence, teach doctrines different from these (for
no one is greater than the Master); nor, on the other hand, will he who
is deficient in power of expression inflict injury on the tradition. For
the faith being ever one and the same, neither does one who is able at
great length to discourse regarding it, make any addition to it, nor
does one, who can say but little diminish it.

<span id="ix.ii.xi-p8"></span>3. It does not follow because men are
endowed with greater and less degrees of intelligence, that they should
therefore change the subject-matter \[of the faith\] itself, and should
conceive of some other God besides Him who is the Framer, Maker, and
Preserver of this universe, (as if He were not sufficient <span
id="fr_2790"></span>[2791](#fn_2790) for them.md), or of another Christ, or
another Only-begotten. But the fact referred to simply implies this,
that one may \[more accurately than another\] bring out the meaning of
those things which have been spoken in parables, and accommodate them to
the general scheme of the faith; and explain \[with special clearness\]
the operation and dispensation of God connected with human salvation;
and show that God manifested longsuffering in regard to the apostasy of
the angels who transgressed, as also with respect to the disobedience of
men; and set forth why it is that one and the same God has made some
things temporal and some eternal, some heavenly and others earthly; and
understand for what reason God, though invisible, manifested Himself to
the prophets not under one form, but differently to different
individuals; and show why it was that more covenants than one were given
to mankind; and teach what was the special character of each of these
covenants; and search out for what reason “God <span
id="fr_2791"></span>[2792](#fn_2791.md) hath concluded every man <span
id="fr_2792"></span>[2793](#fn_2792.md) in unbelief, that He may have mercy
upon all;” and gratefully <span id="fr_2793"></span>[2794](#fn_2793.md)
describe on what account the Word of God became flesh and suffered; and
relate why the advent of the Son of God took place in these last times,
that is, in the end, rather than in the beginning \[of the world\]; and
unfold what is contained in the Scriptures concerning the end
\[itself\], and things to come; and not be silent as to how it is that
God has made the Gentiles, whose salvation was despaired of,
fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers with the saints; and
discourse how it is that “this mortal body shall put on immortality, and
this corruptible shall put on incorruption;” <span
id="fr_2794"></span>[2795](#fn_2794.md) and proclaim in what sense \[God\]
says, “That is a people who was not a people; and she is beloved who was
not beloved;” <span id="fr_2795"></span>[2796](#fn_2795.md) and in what
sense He says that “more are the children of her that was desolate, than
of her who possessed a husband.” <span
id="fr_2796"></span>[2797](#fn_2796.md) For in reference to these points,
and others of a like nature, the apostle exclaims: “Oh! the depth of the
riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God; how unsearchable are His
judgments, and His ways past finding out!” <span
id="fr_2797"></span>[2798](#fn_2797.md) But \[the superior skill spoken
of\] is not found in this, that any one should, beyond the Creator and
Framer \[of the world\], conceive of the Enthymesis of an erring Æon,
their mother and his, and should thus proceed to such a pitch of
blasphemy; nor does it consist in this, that he should again falsely
imagine, as being above this \[fancied being\], a Pleroma at one time
supposed to contain thirty, and at another time an innumerable tribe of
Æons, as these teachers who are destitute of truly divine wisdom
maintain; while the Catholic Church possesses <span id="page_332">p.
332</span> <span id="ix.ii.xi-Page_332"></span> one and the same faith
throughout the whole world, as we have already said.
