### <span id="viii.vii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—The vain pretensions of false gods.

<span id="viii.vii.v-p1"></span><span id="viii.vii.v-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.vii.v-p1.2"></span>But concerning those who think that they
shall share the holy and perfect name, which some have received by a
vain tradition as if they were gods, Menander in the *Auriga* says:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p1.3"></span>“If there exists a god who walketh
> out  
> With an old woman, or who enters in  
> By stealth to houses through the folding-doors,  
> He ne’er can please me; nay, but only he  
> Who stays at home, a just and righteous God,  
> To give salvation to His worshippers.”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p2"></span>The same Menander, in the *Sacerdos*,
says:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p2.1"></span>“There is no God, O woman, that can
> save  
> One man by another; if indeed a man,  
> With sound of tinkling cymbals, charm a god  
> Where’er he listeth, then assuredly  
> He who doth so is much the greater god.  
> But these, O Rhode, are but the cunning schemes  
> Which daring men of intrigue, unabashed,  
> Invent to earn themselves a livelihood,  
> And yield a laughing-stock unto the age.”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p3"></span>Again, the same Menander, stating his
opinion about those who are received as gods, proving rather that they
are not so, says:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p3.1"></span>“Yea, if I this beheld, I then
> should wish  
> That back to me again my soul returned.  
> For tell me where, O Getas, in the world  
> ’Tis possible to find out righteous gods?”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p4"></span>And in the *Depositum*:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p4.1"></span>“There’s an unrighteous judgment, as
> it seems,  
> Even with the gods.”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p5"></span><span id="viii.vii.v-p5.1"></span>And
Euripides the tragedian, in *Orestes*, says:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p5.2"></span>“Apollo having caused by his
> command  
> The murder of the mother, knoweth not  
> What honesty and justice signify.  
> We serve the gods, whoever they may be;  
> But from the central regions of the earth  
> You see Apollo plainly gives response  
> To mortals, and whate’er he says we do.  
> I him obeyed, when she that bore me fell  
> Slain by my hand: he is the wicked man.  
> Then slay him, for ’twas he that sinned, not I.  
> What could I do? Think you not that the god  
> Should free me from the blame which I do bear?”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p6"></span>The same also in *Hippolytus*:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p6.1"></span>“But on these points the gods do not
> judge right.”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p7"></span>And in *Ion*:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p7.1"></span>“But in the daughter of Erechtheus  
> What interest have I? for that pertains  
> Not unto such as me. But when I come  
> With golden vessels for libations, I  
> The dew shall sprinkle, and yet needs must warn  
> Apollo of his deeds; for when he weds  
> Maidens by force, the children secretly  
> Begotten he betrays, and then neglects  
> When dying. Thus not you; but while you may  
> Always pursue the virtues, for the gods  
> Will surely punish men of wickedness.  
> How is it right that you, who have prescribed  
> Laws for men’s guidance, live unrighteously?  
> But ye being absent, I shall freely speak,  
> And ye to men shall satisfaction give  
> For marriage forced, thou Neptune, Jupiter,  
> Who over heaven presides. The temples ye  
> Have emptied, while injustice ye repay.  
> And though ye laud the prudent to the skies,  
> Yet have ye filled your hands with wickedness.  
> No longer is it right to call men ill  
> If they do imitate the sins <span id="fr_2606"></span>[2607](#fn_2606)
> of gods; <span id="fr_2607"></span>[2608](#fn_2607)  
> Nay, evil let their teachers rather be.”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p10"></span>And in *Archelaus*:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p10.1"></span>“Full oft, my son, do gods mankind
> perplex.”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p11"></span>And in *Bellerophon*:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p11.1"></span>“They are no gods, who do not what
> is right.”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p12"></span>And again in the same:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p12.1"></span>“Gods reign in heaven most
> certainly, says one;  
> But it is false,—and let not him  
> Who speaks thus, be so foolish as to use  
> Ancient tradition, or to pay regard  
> Unto my words: but with unclouded eye  
> Behold the matter in its clearest light.  
> Power absolute, I say, robs men of life  
> And property; transgresses plighted faith;  
> Nor spares even cities, but with cruel hand  
> Despoils and devastates them ruthlessly.  
> But they that do these things have more success  
> Than those who live a gentle pious life;  
> And cities small, I know, which reverence gods,  
> Submissive bend before the many spears  
> Of larger impious ones; yea, and methinks  
> If any man lounge idly, and abstain  
> From working with his hands for sustenance,  
> Yet pray the gods; he very soon will know  
> If they from him misfortunes will avert.”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p13"></span>And Menander in *Diphilus*: <span
id="fr_2608"></span>[2609](#fn_2608) —

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p14.1"></span>“Therefore ascribe we praise and
> honour great  
> To Him who Father is, and Lord of all;  
> Sole maker and preserver of mankind,  
> And who with all good things our earth has stored.”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p15"></span>The same also in the *Piscatores*:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p15.1"></span>“For I deem that which nourishes my
> life  
> Is God; but he whose custom ’tis to meet  
> The wants of men,—He needs not at our hands  
> Renewed supplies, Himself being all in all.” <span
> id="fr_2609"></span>[2610](#fn_2609)  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p17"></span>The same in the *Fratres*:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p17.1"></span>“God ever is intelligence to
> those  
> Who righteous are: so wisest men have thought.”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p18"></span>And in the *Tibicinæ*:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p18.1"></span>“Good reason finds a temple in all
> things  
> Wherein to worship; for what is the mind,  
> But just the voice of God within us placed?”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p19"></span> <span id="page_293">p. 293</span>
<span id="viii.vii.v-Page_293"></span> <span
id="viii.vii.v-p19.1"></span>And the tragedian in *Phrixus*:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p19.2"></span>“But if the pious and the impious  
> Share the same lot, how could we think it just,  
> If Jove, the best, judges not uprightly?”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p20"></span>In *Philoctetes*:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p20.1"></span>“You see how honourable gain is
> deemed  
> Even to the gods; and how he is admired  
> Whose shrine is laden most with yellow gold.  
> What, then, doth hinder thee, since it is good  
> To be like gods, from thus accepting gain?”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p21"></span>In *Hecuba*:—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p21.1"></span>“O Jupiter I whoever thou mayest
> be,  
> Of whom except in word all knowledge fails;”  

<span id="viii.vii.v-p22"></span>and,—

> <span id="viii.vii.v-p22.1"></span>“Jupiter, whether thou art indeed  
> A great necessity, or the mind of man,  
> I worship thee!”
