### <span id="iii.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Occasion of the epistle.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p1"></span><span id="iii.ii.i-p1.1"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="iii.ii.i-p1.2"></span>Since</span> I see thee,
most excellent Diognetus, exceedingly desirous to learn the mode of
worshipping God prevalent among the Christians, and inquiring very
carefully and earnestly concerning them, what God they trust in, and
what form of religion they observe, <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) so as all to look down upon the world
itself, and despise death, while they neither esteem those to be gods
that are reckoned such by the Greeks, nor hold to the superstition of
the Jews; and what is the affection which they cherish among themselves;
and why, in fine, this new kind or practice \[of piety\] has only now
entered into the world, <span id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) and not
long ago; I cordially welcome this thy desire, and I implore God, who
enables us both to speak and to hear, to grant to me so to speak, that,
above all, I may hear you have been edified, <span
id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) and to you so to hear, that I who
speak may have no cause of regret for having done so.
