### <span id="ii.ii.lix-p0.1"></span>Chapter LIX.—The Corinthians are exhorted speedily to send back word that peace has been restored. The benediction.

<span id="ii.ii.lix-p1"></span>Send back speedily to us in peace and
with joy these our messengers to you: Claudius Ephebus and Valerius
Bito, with Fortunatus: that they may the sooner announce to us the peace
and harmony we so earnestly desire and long for \[among you\], and that
we may the more quickly rejoice over the good order re-established among
you. <span id="ii.ii.lix-p1.1"></span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
be with you, and with all everywhere that are the called of God through
Him, by whom be to Him glory, honour, power, majesty, and eternal
dominion, <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) from everlasting to
everlasting. <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) Amen. <span
id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md)

<span id="ii.ii.lix-p4"></span> \[Note St. Clement’s frequent
doxologies.\] \[N.B.—The language of Clement concerning the Western
progress of St. Paul (cap. v.) is our earliest postscript to his
Scripture biography. It is sufficient to refer the reader to the great
works of Conybeare and Howson, and of Mr. Lewin, on the *Life and
Epistles of St. Paul*. See more especially the valuable note of Lewin
(vol. ii. p. 294) which takes notice of the opinion of some learned men,
that the great Apostle of the Gentiles preached the Gospel in Britain.
The whold subject of St. Paul’s relations with British Christians is
treated by Williams, in his *Antiquities of the Cymry*, with learning
and in an attractive manner. But the reader will find more ready to his
hand, perhaps, the interesting note of Mr. Lewin, on Claudia and Pudens
([2 Tim. iv. 21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.ii.lix-p4.1"></span>), in his *Life and Epistles of St. Paul*,
vol. ii. p. 392. See also Paley’s *Horæ Paulinæ*, p. 40. London, 1820.\]
