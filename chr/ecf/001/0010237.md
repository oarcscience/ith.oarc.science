### <span id="v.xi.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="v.xi.v-p1"></span>Pray for all men; for there is hope of
repentance for them, that they may be counted worthy of God. By your
works especially let them be instructed. Against their harsh words be ye
conciliatory, by meekness of mind and gentleness. Against their
blasphemies do ye give yourselves to prayer; and against their error be
ye armed with faith. Against their fierceness be ye peaceful and quiet,
and be ye not astounded by them. Let us, then, be imitators of our Lord
in meekness, and strive who shall more especially be injured, and
oppressed, and defrauded.
