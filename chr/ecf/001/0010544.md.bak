### <span id="viii.iv.lxxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXXIII.—It is proved that the Psalm, “The Lord said to My Lord,” etc., does not suit Hezekiah.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxxiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxxiii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxxiii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxxiii-p1.3"></span>“For your teachers have ventured to
refer the passage, ‘The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till
I make Thine enemies Thy footstool,’ to Hezekiah; as if he were
requested to sit on the right side of the temple, when the king of
Assyria sent to him and threatened him; and he was told by Isaiah not to
be afraid. Now we know and admit that what Isaiah said took place; that
the king of Assyria desisted from waging war against Jerusalem in
Hezekiah’s days, and the angel of the Lord slew about 185, 000 of the
host of the Assyrians. But it is manifest that the Psalm does not refer
to him. For thus it is written, ‘The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at My
right hand, till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. He shall send forth
a rod of power over <span id="fr_2275"></span>[2276](#fn_2275.md)
Jerusalem, and it shall rule in the midst of Thine <span
id="fr_2276"></span>[2277](#fn_2276.md) enemies. In the splendour of the
saints before the morning star have I begotten Thee. The Lord hath
sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order
of Melchizedek.’ Who does not admit, then, that Hezekiah is no priest
for ever after the order of Melchizedek? And who does not know that he
is not the redeemer of Jerusalem? And who does not know that he neither
sent a rod of power into Jerusalem, nor ruled in the midst of his
enemies; but that it was God who averted from him the enemies, after he
mourned and was afflicted? But our Jesus, who has not yet come in glory,
has sent into Jerusalem a rod of power, namely, the word of calling and
repentance \[meant\] for all nations over which demons held sway, as
David says, ‘The gods of the nations are demons.’ And His strong word
has prevailed on many to forsake the demons whom they used to serve, and
by means of it to believe in the Almighty God because the gods of the
nations are demons. <span id="fr_2277"></span>[2278](#fn_2277.md) And we
mentioned formerly that the statement, ‘In the splendour of the saints
before the morning star have I begotten Thee from the womb,’ is made to
Christ.

from [Ps. cx.](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#000.md)<span

previous quotation of the same Psalm in chap. xxxii. \[Justin often

<span id="viii.iv.lxxxiii-p4"></span> This last clause is thought to be
an interpolation.
