### <span id="ix.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Texts of Holy Scripture used by these heretics to support their opinions.

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.ii.iv-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.ii.iv-p1.2"></span>Such, then, is the account they give of what
took place within the Pleroma; such the calamities that flowed from the
passion which seized upon the Æon who has been named, and who was within
a little of perishing by being absorbed in the universal substance,
through her inquisitive searching after the Father; such the
consolidation <span id="fr_2680"></span>[2681](#fn_2680.md) \[of that Æon\]
from her condition of agony by <span id="ix.ii.iv-p2.2"></span><span
id="ix.ii.iv-p2.3"></span>Horos, and Stauros, and Lytrotes, and
Carpistes, and Horothetes, and Metagoges. <span
id="fr_2681"></span>[2682](#fn_2681.md) <span
id="ix.ii.iv-p3.3"></span>Such also is the account of the generation of
the later Æons, namely of the first Christ and of the Holy Spirit, both
of whom were produced by the Father after the repentance <span
id="fr_2682"></span>[2683](#fn_2682.md) \[of Sophia\], and of the
second <span id="fr_2683"></span>[2684](#fn_2683.md) Christ (whom they also
style Saviour), who owed his being to the joint contributions \[of the
Æons\]. <span id="ix.ii.iv-p5.1"></span>They tell us, however, that this
knowledge has not been openly divulged, because all are not capable of
receiving it, but has been mystically revealed by the Saviour through
means of parables to those qualified for understanding it. This has been
done as follows. The thirty Æons are indicated (as we have already
remarked) by the thirty years during which they say the Saviour
performed no public act, and by the parable of the labourers in the
vineyard. Paul also, they affirm, very clearly and frequently names
these Æons, and even goes so far as to preserve their order, when he
says, “To all the generations of the Æons of the Æon.” <span
id="fr_2684"></span>[2685](#fn_2684.md) Nay, we ourselves, when at the
giving <span id="fr_2685"></span>[2686](#fn_2685.md) of thanks we pronounce
the words, “To Æons of Æons” (for ever and ever), do set forth these
Æons. And, in fine, wherever the words Æon or Æons occur, they at once
refer them to these beings.

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p8"></span>2. <span id="ix.ii.iv-p8.1"></span>The
production, again, of the Duodecad of the Æons, is indicated by the fact
that the Lord was *twelve* <span id="fr_2686"></span>[2687](#fn_2686.md)
years of age when He disputed with the teachers of the law, and by the
election of the apostles, for of these there were twelve. <span
id="fr_2687"></span>[2688](#fn_2687.md) The other eighteen Æons are made
manifest in this way: that the Lord, \[according to them,\] conversed
with His disciples for eighteen months <span
id="fr_2688"></span>[2689](#fn_2688.md) after His resurrection from the
dead. <span id="ix.ii.iv-p11.2"></span>They also affirm that these
eighteen Æons are strikingly indicated by the first two letters of His
name \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.ii.iv-p11.3"></span>᾽Ιησοῦς</span>\], namely *Iota* <span
id="fr_2689"></span>[2690](#fn_2689.md) and *Eta*. And, in like manner,
they assert that the ten Æons are pointed out by the letter *Iota*,
which begins His name; while, for the same reason, they tell us the
Saviour said, “One *Iota*, or one tittle, shall by no means pass away
until all be fulfilled.” <span id="fr_2690"></span>[2691](#fn_2690.md)

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p14"></span>3. <span id="ix.ii.iv-p14.1"></span><span
id="ix.ii.iv-p14.2"></span>They further maintain that the passion which
took place in the case of the twelfth Æon is pointed at by the apostasy
of Judas, who was the twelfth apostle, and also by the fact that Christ
suffered in the twelfth month. For their opinion is, that He continued
to preach for one year only after His baptism. The same thing is also
most clearly indicated by the case of the woman who suffered from an
issue of blood. For after she had been thus afflicted during twelve
years, she was healed by the advent of the Saviour, when she had touched
the border of His garment; and on this account the Saviour said, “Who
touched me?” <span id="fr_2691"></span>[2692](#fn_2691.md) —teaching his
disciples the mystery which had occurred among the Æons, and the healing
of that Æon who had been involved in suffering. For she who had been
afflicted twelve years represented that power whose essence, as they
narrate, was stretching itself forth, and flowing into immensity; and
unless she had touched the garment of the Son, <span
id="fr_2692"></span>[2693](#fn_2692.md) that is, Aletheia of the first
Tetrad, who is denoted by the hem spoken of, she would have been
dissolved into the general essence <span
id="fr_2693"></span>[2694](#fn_2693.md) \[of which she participated\]. She
stopped short, however, and ceased any longer to suffer. For the power
that went forth from the Son (and this power they term Horos) healed
her, and separated the passion from her.

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p18"></span>4. They moreover affirm that the
Saviour <span id="fr_2694"></span>[2695](#fn_2694.md) is shown to be
derived from all the Æons, and to be in Himself *everything* by the
following passage: “Every male that openeth the womb.” <span
id="fr_2695"></span>[2696](#fn_2695.md) For He, being everything, opened
the womb <span id="fr_2696"></span>[2697](#fn_2696.md) of the enthymesis of
the suffering Æon, when <span id="page_320">p. 320</span> <span
id="ix.ii.iv-Page_320"></span> it had been expelled from the Pleroma.
This they also style the second Ogdoad, of which we shall speak
presently. And they state that it was clearly on this account that Paul
said, “And He Himself is all things;” <span
id="fr_2697"></span>[2698](#fn_2697.md) and again, “All things are to Him,
and of Him are all things;” <span id="fr_2698"></span>[2699](#fn_2698.md)
and further, “In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead;” <span
id="fr_2699"></span>[2700](#fn_2699.md) and yet again, “All things are
gathered together by God in Christ.” <span
id="fr_2700"></span>[2701](#fn_2700.md) Thus do they interpret these and
any like passages to be found in Scripture.

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p26"></span>5. They show, further, that that Horos of
theirs, whom they call by a variety of names, has two faculties,—the one
of supporting, and the other of separating; and in so far as he supports
and sustains, he is Stauros, while in so far as he divides and
separates, he is Horos. They then represent the Saviour as having
indicated this twofold faculty: first, the sustaining power, when He
said, “Whosoever doth not bear his cross (Stauros), and follow after me,
cannot be my disciple;” <span id="fr_2701"></span>[2702](#fn_2701.md) and
again, “Taking up the cross, follow me;” <span
id="fr_2702"></span>[2703](#fn_2702.md) but the separating power when He
said, “I came not to send peace, but a sword.” <span
id="fr_2703"></span>[2704](#fn_2703.md) They also maintain that John
indicated the same thing when he said, “The fan is in His hand, and He
will thoroughly purge the floor, and will gather the wheat into His
garner; but the chaff He will burn with fire unquenchable.” <span
id="fr_2704"></span>[2705](#fn_2704.md) By this declaration He set forth
the faculty of Horos. For that fan they explain to be the cross
(Stauros), which consumes, no doubt, all material <span
id="fr_2705"></span>[2706](#fn_2705.md) objects, as fire does chaff, but it
purifies all them that are saved, as a fan does wheat. Moreover, they
affirm that the Apostle Paul himself made mention of this cross in the
following words: “The doctrine of the cross is to them that perish
foolishness, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.” <span
id="fr_2706"></span>[2707](#fn_2706.md) And again: “God forbid that I
should glory in anything <span id="fr_2707"></span>[2708](#fn_2707.md) save
in the cross of Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I unto
the world.”

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p34"></span>6. <span id="ix.ii.iv-p34.1"></span>Such,
then, is the account which they all give of their Pleroma, and of the
formation <span id="fr_2708"></span>[2709](#fn_2708.md) of the universe,
striving, as they do, to adapt the good words of revelation to their own
wicked inventions. And it is not only from the writings of the
evangelists and the apostles that they endeavour to derive proofs for
their opinions by means of perverse interpretations and deceitful
expositions: they deal in the same way with the law and the prophets,
which contain many parables and allegories that can frequently be drawn
into various senses, according to the kind of exegesis to which they are
subjected. And others <span id="fr_2709"></span>[2710](#fn_2709.md) of
them, with great craftiness, adapted such parts of Scripture to their
own figments, lead away captive from the truth those who do not retain a
stedfast faith in one God, the Father Almighty, and in one Lord Jesus
Christ, the Son of God.

<span id="fn_2680"></span>[319:2681](0010700.htm#fr_2680.md) <span
id="ix.ii.iv-p1.3"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p2"></span> The reading is here very doubtful. We
have followed the text of Grabe (approved by Harvey), <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>ἐξ ἀγῶνος σύμπηξις</span>.

<span id="fn_2681"></span>[319:2682](0010700.htm#fr_2681.md) <span
id="ix.ii.iv-p2.4"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p3"></span> These are all names of the same person:
see above, ii. 4. Hence some have proposed the reading <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ii.iv-p3.1"></span>ἑξαιώνιος</span> instead
of <span class="Greek"><span id="ix.ii.iv-p3.2"></span>ἐξ ἀγῶνος</span>,
alluding to the *sixfold* appellation of the Æon Horos.

<span id="fn_2682"></span>[319:2683](0010700.htm#fr_2682.md) <span
id="ix.ii.iv-p3.4"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p4"></span> Billius renders, “from the repentance of
the Father,” but the above seems preferable.

<span id="fn_2683"></span>[319:2684](0010700.htm#fr_2683.md) <span
id="ix.ii.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p5"></span> Harvey remarks, “Even in their
Christology the Valentinians must have their part and counterpart.”

<span id="fn_2684"></span>[319:2685](0010700.htm#fr_2684.md) <span
id="ix.ii.iv-p5.2"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p6"></span> Or, “to all the generations of the ages
of the age.” See [Eph. iii. 21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#021.md)<span
id="ix.ii.iv-p6.1"></span>. The apostle, of course, simply uses these
words as a strong expression to denote “for ever.”

<span id="fn_2685"></span>[319:2686](0010700.htm#fr_2685.md) <span
id="ix.ii.iv-p6.2"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p7"></span> Literally, “at the thanksgiving,” or
“eucharist.” Massuet, the Benedictine editor, refers this to the Lord’s
Supper, and hence concludes that some of the ancient liturgies still
extant must even then have been in use. Harvey and others, however, deny
that there is any necessity for supposing the Holy Eucharist to be
referred to; the ancient Latin version translates in the plural, “in
gratiarum actionibus.”

<span id="fn_2686"></span>[319:2687](0010700.htm#fr_2686.md) <span

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p11"></span> This opinion is in positive
contradiction to the *forty days* mentioned by St. Luke ([Acts i.
3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003)<span id="ix.ii.iv-p11.1"></span>.md).
But the Valentinians seem to have followed a spurious writing of their
own called “The Gospel of Truth.” See iii. 11, 8.

<span id="fn_2689"></span>[319:2690](0010700.htm#fr_2689.md) <span
id="ix.ii.iv-p11.4"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p12"></span> The numeral value of *Iota* in Greek is
ten, and of *Eta*, eight.

id="ix.ii.iv-p15.2"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p16"></span> The Latin reads “filii,” which we have
followed. Reference is made in this word to Nous, who was, as we have
already seen, also called *Son*, and who interested himself in the
recovery of Sophia. Aletheia was his consort, and was typified by the
hem of the Saviour’s garment.

<span id="fn_2693"></span>[319:2694](0010700.htm#fr_2693.md) <span

<span id="ix.ii.iv-p17"></span> Her individuality (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ii.iv-p17.1"></span>μορφή</span>) would have
been lost, while her substance (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.ii.iv-p17.2"></span>οὐσία</span>) would have survived in the
common essence of the Æons.

It will be observed that the quotations of Scripture made by Irenæus
often vary somewhat from the received text. This may be due to various
reasons—his quoting from memory; his giving the texts in the form in
which they were quoted by the heretics; or, as Harvey conjectures, from
his having been more familiar with a Syriac version of the New Testament
than with the Greek original.
