### <span id="ix.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—The apostles did not commence to preach the Gospel, or to place anything on record until they were endowed with the gifts and power of the Holy Spirit. They preached one God alone, Maker of heaven and earth.

<span id="ix.iv.ii-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.iv.ii-p1.1"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="ix.iv.ii-p1.2"></span>We</span> have learned
from none others the plan of our salvation, than from those through whom
the Gospel has come down to us, which they did at one time proclaim in
public, and, at a later period, by the will of God, handed down to us in
the Scriptures, to be the ground and pillar of our faith. <span
id="fr_3308"></span>[3309](#fn_3308.md) For it is unlawful to assert that
they preached before they possessed “perfect knowledge,” as some do even
venture to say, boasting themselves as improvers of the apostles. For,
after our Lord rose from the dead, \[the apostles\] were invested with
power from on high when the Holy Spirit came down \[upon them\], were
filled from all \[His gifts\], and had perfect knowledge: they departed
to the ends of the earth, preaching the glad tidings of the good things
\[sent\] from God to us, and proclaiming the peace of heaven to men, who
indeed do all equally and individually possess the Gospel of God.
Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews <span
id="fr_3309"></span>[3310](#fn_3309.md) in their own dialect, while Peter
and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying the foundations of the
Church. After their departure, Mark, the disciple and interpreter of
Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached by
Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel
preached by him. Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also
had leaned upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his
residence at Ephesus in Asia.

<span id="ix.iv.ii-p4"></span>2. <span id="ix.iv.ii-p4.1"></span>These
have all declared to us that there is one God, Creator of heaven and
earth, announced <span id="page_415">p. 415</span> <span
id="ix.iv.ii-Page_415"></span> by the law and the prophets; and one
Christ the Son of God. If any one do not agree to these truths, he
despises the companions of the Lord; nay more, he despises Christ
Himself the Lord; yea, he despises the Father also, and stands
self-condemned, resisting and opposing his own salvation, as is the case
with all heretics.
