### <span id="viii.iv.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—The Jews boast in vain that they are sons of Abraham.

<span id="viii.iv.xxv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>“Those who justify themselves, and say they
are sons of Abraham, shall be desirous even in a small degree to receive
the inheritance along with you; <span
id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008.md) as the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of
Isaiah, cries, speaking thus while he personates them: ‘Return from
heaven, and behold from the habitation of Thy holiness and glory. Where
is Thy zeal and strength? Where is the multitude of Thy mercy? for Thou
hast sustained us, O Lord. For Thou art our Father, because Abraham is
ignorant of us, and Israel has not recognised us. But Thou, O Lord, our
Father, <span id="page_207">p. 207</span> <span
id="viii.iv.xxv-Page_207"></span> deliver us: from the beginning Thy
name is upon us. O Lord, why hast Thou made us to err from Thy way? and
hardened our hearts, so that we do not fear Thee? Return for Thy
servants’ sake, the tribes of Thine inheritance, that we may inherit for
a little Thy holy mountain. We were as from the beginning, when Thou
didst not bear rule over us, and when Thy name was not called upon us.
If Thou wilt open the heavens, trembling shall seize the mountains
before Thee: and they shall be melted, as wax melts before the fire; and
fire shall consume the adversaries, and Thy name shall be manifest among
the adversaries; the nations shall be put into disorder before Thy face.
When Thou shall do glorious things, trembling shall seize the mountains
before Thee. From the beginning we have not heard, nor have our eyes
seen a God besides Thee: and Thy works, <span
id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009.md) the mercy which Thou shall show to
those who repent. He shall meet those who do righteousness, and they
shall remember Thy ways. Behold, Thou art wroth, and we were sinning.
Therefore we have erred and become all unclean, and all our
righteousness is as the rags of a woman set apart: and we have faded
away like leaves by reason of our iniquities; thus the wind will take us
away. And there is none that calleth upon Thy name, or remembers to take
hold of Thee; for Thou hast turned away Thy face from us, and hast given
us up on account of our sins. And now return, O Lord, for we are all Thy
people. The city of Thy holiness has become desolate. Zion has become as
a wilderness, Jerusalem a curse; the house, our holiness, and the glory
which our fathers blessed, has been burned with fire; and all the
glorious nations <span id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010.md) have fallen
along with it. And in addition to these \[misfortunes\], O Lord, Thou
hast refrained Thyself, and art silent, and hast humbled us very much.’
” <span id="fr_2011"></span>[2012](#fn_2011.md)

<span id="viii.iv.xxv-p6"></span>And Trypho remarked, “What is this you
say? that none of us shall inherit anything on the holy mountain of
God?”
