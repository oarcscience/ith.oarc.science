### <span id="v.v.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—I desire to die.

<span id="v.v.v-p1"></span><span id="v.v.v-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.v.v-p1.2"></span>From Syria even unto Rome I fight with
beasts, <span id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849.md) both by land and sea,
both by night and day, being bound to ten leopards, I mean a band of
soldiers, who, even when they receive benefits, <span
id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850.md) show themselves all the worse. But I
am the more instructed by their injuries \[to act as a disciple of
Christ\]; “yet am I not thereby justified.” <span
id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851.md) May I enjoy the wild beasts that are
prepared for me; and I pray they may be found eager to rush upon me,
which also I will entice to devour me speedily, and not deal with me as
with some, whom, out of fear, they have not touched. But if they be
unwilling to assail me, I will compel them to do so. Pardon me <span
id="page_76">p. 76</span> <span id="v.v.v-Page_76"></span> \[in this\]:
I know what is for my benefit. Now I begin to be a disciple. And let no
one, of things visible or invisible, envy <span
id="fr_852"></span>[853](#fn_852.md) me that I should attain to Jesus
Christ. Let fire and the cross; let the crowds of wild beasts; let
tearings, <span id="fr_853"></span>[854](#fn_853.md) breakings, and
dislocations of bones; let cutting off of members; let shatterings of
the whole body; and let all the dreadful <span
id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854.md) torments of the devil come upon me:
only let me attain to Jesus Christ.

<span id="v.v.v-p8"></span><span id="v.v.v-p8.1"></span><span
id="v.v.v-p8.2"></span>From Syria even unto Rome I fight with
beasts, <span id="fr_855"></span>[856](#fn_855.md) both by land and sea,
both by night and day, being bound to ten leopards, I mean a band of
soldiers, who, even when they receive benefits, <span
id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856.md) show themselves all the worse. But I
am the more instructed by their injuries \[to act as a disciple of
Christ\]; “yet am I not thereby justified.” <span
id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857.md) May I enjoy the wild beasts that are
prepared for me; and I pray that they may be found eager to rush upon
me, which also I will entice to devour me speedily, and not deal with me
as with some, whom, out of fear, they have not touched. But if they be
unwilling to assail me, I will compel them to do so. Pardon me \[in
this\] I know what is for my benefit. Now I begin to be a disciple, and
have <span id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858.md) no desire after anything
visible or invisible, that I may attain to Jesus Christ. Let fire and
the cross; let the crowds of wild beasts; let breakings, tearings, and
separations of bones; let cutting off of members; let bruising to pieces
of the whole body; and let the very torment of the devil come upon me:
only let me attain to Jesus Christ.
