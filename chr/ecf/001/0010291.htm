<p><a name="v.xvii.iii-p1"></A>For there is but One that became incarnate, and that neither the Father nor the Paraclete, but the Son only, [who became so] not in appearance or imagination, but in reality. For &#8220;the Word became flesh.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1316"></A><A HREF="#fn_1316"><FONT SIZE="1">1317</FONT></A>
 For &#8220;Wisdom builded for herself a house.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1317"></A><A HREF="#fn_1317"><FONT SIZE="1">1318</FONT></A>
 And God the Word was born as man, with a body, of the Virgin, without any intercourse of man. For [it is written], &#8220;A virgin shall conceive in her womb, and bring forth a son.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1318"></A><A HREF="#fn_1318"><FONT SIZE="1">1319</FONT></A>
 He was then truly born, truly grew up, truly ate and drank, was truly crucified, and died, and rose again. He who believes these things, as they really were,  <A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A> <a name="v.xvii.iii-Page_117"></A>  and as they really took place, is blessed. He who believeth them not is no less accursed than those who crucified the Lord. For the prince of this world rejoiceth when any one denies the cross, since he knows that the confession of the cross is his own destruction. For that is the trophy which has been raised up against his power, which when he sees, he shudders, and when he hears of, is afraid.</p>
