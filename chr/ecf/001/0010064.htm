<p class="endnote"><a name="ii.ii.lix-p4"></A> [Note St. Clement&#146;s frequent doxologies.] [N.B.&#8212;The language of Clement concerning the Western progress of St. Paul (cap. v.) is our earliest postscript to his Scripture biography. It is sufficient to refer the reader to the great works of Conybeare and Howson, and of Mr. Lewin, on the <i>Life and Epistles of St. Paul</i>. See more especially the valuable note of Lewin (vol. ii. p. 294) which takes notice of the opinion of some learned men, that the great Apostle of the Gentiles preached the Gospel in Britain. The whold subject of St. Paul&#146;s relations with British Christians is treated by Williams, in his <i>Antiquities of the Cymry</i>, with learning and in an attractive manner. But the reader will find more ready to his hand, perhaps, the interesting note of Mr. Lewin, on Claudia and Pudens (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021">2 Tim. iv. 21</a><a name="ii.ii.lix-p4.1"></A>), in his <i>Life and Epistles of St. Paul</i>, vol. ii. p. 392. See also Paley&#146;s <i>Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;</i>, p. 40. London, 1820.]</p>
