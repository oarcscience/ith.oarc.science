### <span id="v.x.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="v.x.i-p1"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.x.i-p1.1"></span>Because</span> thy mind is acceptable to me,
inasmuch as it is established in God, as on a rock which is immoveable,
I glorify God the more exceedingly that I have been counted worthy of
\[seeing\] thy face, which I longed after in God. Now I beseech thee, by
the grace with which thou art clothed, to add \[speed\] to thy course,
and that thou ever pray for all men that they may be saved, and that
thou demand <span id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131.md) things which are
befitting, with all assiduity both of the flesh and spirit. Be studious
of unity, than which nothing is more precious. Bear with all men, even
as our Lord beareth with thee. Show patience <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132.md) with all men in love, as \[indeed\]
thou doest. Be stedfast in prayer. Ask for more understanding than that
which thou \[already\] hast. Be watchful, as possessing a spirit which
sleepeth not. Speak with every man according to the will of God. Bear
the infirmities of all men as a perfect athlete; for where the labour is
great, the gain is also great.
