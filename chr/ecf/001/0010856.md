### <span id="ix.vii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—God the Father and His Word have formed all created things (which They use) by Their own power and wisdom, not out of defect or ignorance. The Son of God, who received all power from the Father, would otherwise never have taken flesh upon Him.

<span id="ix.vii.xix-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vii.xix-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.vii.xix-p1.2"></span>And such
or so important a dispensation He did not bring about by means of the
creations of others, but by His own; neither by those things which were
created out of ignorance and defect, but by those which had their
substance from the wisdom and power of His Father. For He was neither
unrighteous, so that He should covet the property of another; nor needy,
that He could not by His own means impart life to His own, and make use
of His own creation for the salvation of man. For indeed the creation
could not have sustained Him \[on the cross\], if He had sent forth
\[simply by commission\] what was the fruit of ignorance and defect. Now
we have repeatedly shown that the incarnate Word of God was suspended
upon a tree, and even the very heretics do acknowledge that He was
crucified. How, then, could the fruit of ignorance and defect sustain
Him who contains the knowledge of all things, and is true and perfect?
Or how could that creation which was concealed from the Father, and far
removed from Him, have sustained His Word? And if this world were made
by the angels (it matters not whether we suppose their ignorance or
their cognizance of the Supreme God), when the Lord declared, “For I am
in the Father, and the Father in Me,” <span
id="fr_4603"></span>[4604](#fn_4603) how could this workmanship of the
angels have borne to be burdened at once with the Father and the Son?
How, again, could that creation which is beyond the Pleroma have
contained Him who contains the entire Pleroma? Inasmuch, then, as all
these things are impossible and incapable of proof, that preaching of
the Church is alone true \[which proclaims\] that His own creation bare
Him, which subsists by the power, the skill, and the wisdom of God;
which is sustained, indeed, after an invisible manner by the Father,
but, on the contrary, after a visible manner it bore His Word: and this
is the true \[Word\].

<span id="ix.vii.xix-p3"></span>2. For the Father bears the creation and
His own Word simultaneously, and the Word borne by the Father grants the
Spirit to all as the Father wills. <span
id="fr_4604"></span>[4605](#fn_4604) To some He gives after the manner
of creation what is made; <span id="fr_4605"></span>[4606](#fn_4605) but
to others \[He gives\] after the manner of adoption, that is, what is
from God, namely generation. And thus one God the Father is declared,
who is above all, and through all, and in all. The Father is indeed
above all, and He is the Head of Christ; but the Word is through all
things, and is Himself the Head of the Church; while the Spirit is in us
all, and He is the living water, <span
id="fr_4606"></span>[4607](#fn_4606) which the Lord grants to those who
rightly believe in Him, and love Him, and who know that “there is one
Father, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.” <span
id="fr_4607"></span>[4608](#fn_4607) And to these things does John also,
the disciple of the Lord, bear witness, when he speaks thus in the
Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God. This was in the beginning with God. All things were
made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.” <span
id="fr_4608"></span>[4609](#fn_4608) And then he said of the Word
Himself: “He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the
world knew Him not. To His own things He came, and His own people
received Him not. However, as many as did receive Him, to these gave He
power to become the sons of God, to those that believe in His
name.” <span id="fr_4609"></span>[4610](#fn_4609) And again, showing the
dispensation with regard to His human nature, John said: “And the Word
was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” <span
id="fr_4610"></span>[4611](#fn_4610) And in continuation he says, “And
we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten by the Father,
full of grace and truth.” He thus plainly points out to those willing to
hear, that is, to those having ears, that there is one God, the Father
over all, and one Word of God, who is through all, by whom all things
have been made; and that this world belongs to Him, and was made by Him,
according to the Father’s will, and not by angels; nor by apostasy,
defect, and ignorance; nor by any power of Prunicus, whom certain of
them also call “the Mother;” nor by any other maker of the world
ignorant of the Father.

<span id="ix.vii.xix-p11"></span>3. <span
id="ix.vii.xix-p11.1"></span>For the Creator of the world is truly the
Word of God: and this is our Lord, who in the last times was made man,
existing in this world, and who in an invisible manner contains all
things created, and is inherent in the entire creation, since the Word
of God governs and arranges all <span id="page_547">p. 547</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xix-Page_547"></span> things; and therefore He came to His
own in a visible <span id="fr_4611"></span>[4612](#fn_4611) manner, and
was made flesh, and hung upon the tree, that He might sum up all things
in Himself. “And His own peculiar people did not receive Him,” as Moses
declared this very thing among the people: “And thy life shall be
hanging before thine eyes, and thou wilt not believe thy life.” <span
id="fr_4612"></span>[4613](#fn_4612) Those therefore who did not receive
Him did not receive life. “But to as many as received Him, to them gave
He power to become the sons of God.” <span
id="fr_4613"></span>[4614](#fn_4613) For it is He who has power from the
Father over all things, since He is the Word of God, and very man,
communicating with invisible beings after the manner of the intellect,
and appointing a law observable to the outward senses, that all things
should continue each in its own order; and He reigns manifestly over
things visible and pertaining to men; and brings in just judgment and
worthy upon all; as David also, clearly pointing to this, says, “Our God
shall openly come, and will not keep silence.” <span
id="fr_4614"></span>[4615](#fn_4614) Then he shows also the judgment
which is brought in by Him, saying, “A fire shall burn in His sight, and
a strong tempest shall rage round about Him. He shall call upon the
heaven from above, and the earth, to judge His people.”

<span id="ix.vii.xix-p4"></span> From this passage Harvey infers that
Irenæus held the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the
Son,—a doctrine denied by the Oriental Church in after times. \[Here is
nothing about the “procession:” only the “mission” of the Spirit is here
concerned. And the Easterns object to the double procession itself only
in so far as any one means thereby to deny “quod solus Pater est
divinarum personarum, Principium et Fons,”—<span class="Greek"><span
