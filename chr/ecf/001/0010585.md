### <span id="viii.iv.cxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXIV.—Christians are the sons of God.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxiv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxiv-p1.1"></span>And when I saw that they were perturbed
because I said that we are the sons of God, I anticipated their
questioning, and said, “Listen, sirs, how the Holy Ghost speaks of this
people, saying that they are all sons of the Highest; and how this very
Christ will be present in their assembly, rendering judgment to all men.
The <span id="page_262">p. 262</span> <span
id="viii.iv.cxxiv-Page_262"></span> words are spoken by David, and are,
according to your version of them, thus: ‘God standeth in the
congregation of gods; He judgeth among the gods. How long do ye judge
unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Judge for the orphan and
the poor, and do justice to the humble and needy. Deliver the needy, and
save the poor out of the hand of the wicked. They know not, neither have
they understood; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the
earth shall be shaken. I said, Ye are gods, and are all children of the
Most High. But ye die like men, and fall like one of the princes. Arise,
O God! judge the earth, for Thou shalt inherit all nations.’ <span
id="fr_2432"></span>[2433](#fn_2432) But in the version of the Seventy
it is written, ‘Behold, ye die like men, and fall like one of the
princes,’ <span id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433) in order to
manifest the disobedience of men,—I mean of Adam and Eve,—and the fall
of one of the princes, i.e., of him who was called the serpent, who fell
with a great overthrow, because he deceived Eve. But as my discourse is
not intended to touch on this point, but to prove to you that the Holy
Ghost reproaches men because they were made like God, free from
suffering and death, provided that they kept His commandments, and were
deemed deserving of the name of His sons, and yet they, becoming like
Adam and Eve, work out death for themselves; let the interpretation of
the Psalm be held just as you wish, yet thereby it is demonstrated that
all men are deemed worthy of becoming “gods,” and of having power to
become sons of the Highest; and shall be each by himself judged and
condemned like Adam and Eve. Now I have proved at length that Christ is
called God.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxiv-p3"></span> In the text there is certainly no
distinction given. But if we read <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.cxxiv-p3.1"></span>ὡς ἄνθρωπος</span> (<span
class="Hebrew"><span id="viii.iv.cxxiv-p3.2"></span>כְּאָדָם</span>),
“as a man,” in the first quotation we shall be able to follow Justin’s
argument.
