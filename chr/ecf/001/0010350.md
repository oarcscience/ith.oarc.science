### <span id="vi.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The Lord hath given us the testament which Moses received and broke.

<span id="vi.ii.xiv-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.xiv-p1.2"></span><span id="vi.ii.xiv-p1.3"></span>Yes \[it is
even so\]; but let us inquire if the Lord has really given that
testament which He swore to the fathers that He would give <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640) to the people. He did give it; but
they were not worthy to receive it, on account of their sins. For the
prophet declares, “And Moses was fasting forty days and forty nights on
Mount Sinai, that he might receive the testament of the Lord for the
people.” <span id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641) And he received from
the Lord <span id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642) two tables, written
in the spirit by the finger of the hand of the Lord. And Moses having
received them, carried them down to give to the people. And the Lord
said to Moses, “Moses, Moses, go down quickly; for thy people hath
sinned, whom thou didst bring out of the land of Egypt.” <span
id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643) And Moses understood that they had
again <span id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644) made molten images; and
he threw the tables out of his hands, and the tables of the testament of
the Lord were broken. Moses then received it, but they proved themselves
unworthy. Learn now how *we* have received it. Moses, as a
servant, <span id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645) received it; but the
Lord himself, having suffered in our behalf, hath given it to us, that
we should be the people of inheritance. But He was manifested, in order
that they might be perfected in their iniquities, and that we, being
constituted heirs through Him, <span
id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646) might receive the testament of the
Lord Jesus, who was prepared for this end, that by His personal
manifestation, redeeming our hearts (which were already wasted by death,
and given over to the iniquity of error) from darkness, He might by His
word enter into a covenant with us. For it is written how the Father,
about to redeem <span id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647) us from
darkness, commanded Him to prepare <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648) a holy people for Himself. The
prophet therefore declares, “I, the Lord Thy God, have called Thee in
righteousness, and will hold Thy hand, and will strengthen Thee; and I
have given Thee for a covenant to the people, for a light to the
nations, to open the eyes of the blind, and to bring forth from fetters
them that are bound, and those that sit in darkness out of the
prison-house.” <span id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649) Ye
perceive, <span id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650) then, whence we
have been redeemed. And again, the prophet says, “Behold, I have
appointed Thee as a light to the nations, that Thou mightest be for
salvation even to the ends of the earth, saith the Lord God that
redeemeth thee.” <span id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651) <span
id="vi.ii.xiv-p13.3"></span>And again, the prophet saith, “The Spirit of
the Lord is upon me; because He hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to
the humble: He hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim
deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind; to
announce the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of recompense; to
comfort all that mourn.” <span id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652)
