### <span id="viii.iv.lxxxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXXIX.—The cross alone is offensive to Trypho on account of the curse, yet it proves that Jesus is Christ.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxxix-p1"></span>Then Trypho remarked, “Be assured
that all our nation waits for Christ; and we admit that all the
Scriptures which you have quoted refer to Him. Moreover, I do also admit
that the name of Jesus, by which the the son of Nave (Nun) was called,
has inclined me very strongly to adopt this view. But whether Christ
should be so shamefully crucified, this we are in doubt about. For
whosoever is crucified is said in the law to be accursed, so that I am
exceedingly incredulous on this point. It is quite clear, indeed, that
the Scriptures announce that Christ had to suffer; but we wish to learn
if you can prove it to us whether it was by the suffering cursed in the
law.”

<span id="viii.iv.lxxxix-p2"></span>I replied to him, “If Christ was not
to suffer, and the prophets had not foretold that He would be led to
death on account of the sins of the people, and be dishonoured and
scourged, and reckoned among the transgressors, and as a sheep be led to
the slaughter, whose generation, the prophet says, no man can declare,
then you would have good cause to wonder. But if these are to be
characteristic of Him and mark Him out to all, how is it possible for us
to do anything else than believe in Him most confidently? And will not
as many as have understood the writings of the prophets, whenever they
hear merely that He was crucified, say that this is He and no other?”
