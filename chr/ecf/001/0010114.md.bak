### <span id="iv.iv.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Polycarp is pierced by a dagger.

<span id="iv.iv.xvi-p1"></span>At length, when those wicked men
perceived that his body could not be consumed by the fire, they
commanded an executioner to go near and pierce him through with a
dagger. <span id="iv.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>And on his doing this, there
came forth a dove, <span id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461.md) and a great
quantity of blood, so that the fire was extinguished; and all the people
wondered that there should be such a difference between the unbelievers
and the elect, of whom this most admirable Polycarp was one, having in
our own times been an apostolic and prophetic teacher, and bishop of the
Catholic Church which is in Smyrna. For every word that went out of his
mouth either has been or shall yet be accomplished.

<span id="iv.iv.xvi-p2"></span> Eusebius omits all mention of the
*dove*, and many have thought the text to be here corrupt. It has been
proposed to read <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.xvi-p2.1"></span>ἐπ’ ἀριστερᾷ</span>, “on the left hand side,”
instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.xvi-p2.2"></span>περιστερά</span>, “a dove.”
