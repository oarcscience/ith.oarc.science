### <span id="ii.ii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—God sees all things: therefore let us avoid transgression.

<span id="ii.ii.xxviii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxviii-p1.1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxviii-p1.2"></span>Since
then all things are seen and heard \[by God\], let us fear Him, and
forsake those wicked works which proceed from evil desires; <span
id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114) so that, through His mercy, we may be
protected from the judgments to come. For whither can any of us flee
from His mighty hand? Or what world will receive any of those who run
away from Him? For the Scripture saith in a certain place, “Whither
shall I go, and where shall I be hid from Thy presence? If I ascend into
heaven, Thou art there; if I go away even to the uttermost parts of the
earth, there is Thy right hand; if I make my bed in the abyss, there is
Thy Spirit.” <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115) Whither, then,
shall any one go, or where shall he escape from Him who comprehends all
things?
