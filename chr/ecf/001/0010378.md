### <span id="viii.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Christians charged with atheism.

<span id="viii.ii.v-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii.v-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.v-p1.2"></span>Why, then, should this be? In our case, who
pledge ourselves to do no wickedness, nor to hold these atheistic
opinions, you do not examine the charges made against us; but, yielding
to unreasoning passion, and to the instigation of evil demons, you
punish us without consideration or judgment. For the truth shall be
spoken; since of old these evil demons, effecting apparitions of
themselves, both defiled women and corrupted boys, and showed such
fearful sights to men, that those who did not use their reason in
judging of the actions that were done, were struck with terror; and
being carried away by fear, and not knowing that these were demons, they
called them gods, and gave to each the name which each of the demons
chose for himself. <span id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772) And when
Socrates endeavoured, by true reason and examination, to bring these
things to light, and deliver men from the demons, then the demons
themselves, by means of men who rejoiced in iniquity, compassed his
death, as an atheist and a profane person, on the charge that “he was
introducing new divinities;” and in our case they display a similar
activity. <span id="viii.ii.v-p2.2"></span><span
id="viii.ii.v-p2.3"></span>For not only among the Greeks did reason
(Logos) prevail to condemn these things through Socrates, but also among
the Barbarians were they condemned by Reason (or the Word, the Logos)
Himself, who took shape, and became man, and was called Jesus Christ;
and in obedience to Him, we not only deny that they who did such things
as these are gods, <span id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773) but assert
that they are wicked and impious demons, <span
id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774) whose actions will not bear
comparison with those even of men desirous of virtue.

Milton’s admirable economy in working this truth into his great poem (i.

origin of mythologies.\]

<span id="viii.ii.v-p3"></span> The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.v-p3.1"></span>δαίμων</span> means in Greek a god, but the
Christians used the word to signify an evil spirit. Justin uses the same
word here for god and demon. The connection which Justin and other
Christian writers supposed to exist between evil spirits and the gods of
the heathens will be apparent from Justin’s own statements. The word
<span class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.v-p3.2"></span>διάβολος</span>,
devil, is not applied to these demons. There is but one devil, but many
demons.
