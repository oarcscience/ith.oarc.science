### <span id="ix.vii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—The true Lord and the one God is declared by the law, and manifested by Christ His Son in the Gospel; whom alone we should adore, and from Him we must look for all good things, not from Satan.

<span id="ix.vii.xxiii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vii.xxiii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.vii.xxiii-p1.2"></span>Thus
then does the Lord plainly show that it was the true Lord and the one
God who had been set forth by the law; for Him whom the law proclaimed
as God, the same did Christ point out as the Father, whom also it
behoves the disciples of Christ alone to serve. By means of the
statements of the law, He put our adversary to utter confusion; and the
law directs us to praise God the Creator (*Demiurgum*), and to serve Him
alone. Since this is the case, we must not seek for another Father
besides Him, or above Him, since there is one God who justifies the
circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith. <span
id="fr_4639"></span>[4640](#fn_4639.md) For if there were any other perfect
Father above Him, He (Christ) would by no means have overthrown Satan by
means of His words and commandments. For one ignorance cannot be done
away with by means of another ignorance, any more than one defect by
another defect. If, therefore, the law is due to ignorance and defect,
how could the statements contained therein bring to nought the ignorance
of the devil, and conquer the strong man? For a strong man can be
conquered neither by an inferior nor by an equal, but by one possessed
of greater power. But the Word of God is the superior above all, He who
is loudly proclaimed in the law: “Hear, O Israel, the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vii.xxiii-p2.2"></span>Lord</span> thy God is
one God;” and, “Thou shalt love the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xxiii-p2.3"></span>Lord</span> thy God with all thy heart;”
and, “Him shall thou adore, and Him alone shall thou serve.” <span
id="fr_4640"></span>[4641](#fn_4640.md) Then in the Gospel, casting down
the apostasy by means of these expressions, He did both overcome the
strong man by His Father’s voice, and He acknowledges the commandment of
the law to express His own sentiments, when He says, “Thou shall not
tempt the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xxiii-p3.2"></span>Lord</span> thy God.” <span
id="fr_4641"></span>[4642](#fn_4641.md) For He did not confound the
adversary by the saying of any other, but by that belonging to His own
Father, and thus overcame the strong man.

<span id="ix.vii.xxiii-p5"></span>2. He taught by His commandment that
we who have been set free should, when hungry, take that food which is
given by God; and that, when placed in the exalted position of every
grace \[that can be received\], we should not, either by trusting to
works of righteousness, or when adorned with super-eminent \[gifts of\]
ministration, by any means be lifted up with pride, nor should we tempt
God, but should feel humility in all things, and have ready to hand
\[this saying\], “Thou shall not tempt the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xxiii-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> thy God.” <span
id="fr_4642"></span>[4643](#fn_4642.md) As also the apostle taught, saying,
“Minding not high things, but consenting to things of low estate;” <span
id="fr_4643"></span>[4644](#fn_4643.md) that we should neither be ensnared
with riches, nor mundane glory, nor present fancy, but should know that
we must “worship the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xxiii-p7.2"></span>Lord</span> thy God, and serve Him alone,”
and <span id="page_551">p. 551</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xxiii-Page_551"></span> give no heed to him who falsely
promised things not his own, when he said, “All these will I give thee,
if, falling down, thou wilt worship me.” For he himself confesses that
to adore him, and to do his will, is to fall from the glory of God. And
in what thing either pleasant or good can that man who has fallen
participate? Or what else can such a person hope for or expect, except
death? For death is next neighbour to him who has fallen. Hence also it
follows that he will not give what he has promised. For how can he make
grants to him who has fallen? Moreover, since God rules over men and him
too, and without the will of our Father in heaven not even a sparrow
falls to the ground, <span id="fr_4644"></span>[4645](#fn_4644.md) it
follows that his declaration, “All these things are delivered unto me,
and to whomsoever I will I give them,” proceeds from him when puffed up
with pride. For the creation is not subjected to his power, since indeed
he is himself but one among created things. Nor shall he give away the
rule over men to men; but both all other things, and all human affairs,
are arranged according to God the Father’s disposal. Besides, the Lord
declares that “the devil is a liar from the beginning, and the truth is
not in him.” <span id="fr_4645"></span>[4646](#fn_4645.md) If then he be a
liar and the truth be not in him, he certainly did not speak truth, but
a lie, when he said, “For all these things are delivered to me, and to
whomsoever I will I give them.” <span
