### <span id="viii.vi.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—Plato indebted to the prophets.

<span id="viii.vi.xxvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xxvi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.vi.xxvi-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xxvi-p1.3"></span>And let no one wonder that Plato should
believe Moses regarding the eternity of God. For you will find him
mystically referring the true knowledge of realities to the prophets,
next in order after the really existent God. For, discoursing in the
*Timæus* about certain first principles, he wrote thus: “This we lay
down as the first principle of fire and the other bodies, <span
id="page_284">p. 284</span> <span id="viii.vi.xxvi-Page_284"></span>
proceeding according to probability and necessity. But the first
principles of these again God above knows, and whosoever among men is
beloved of Him.” <span id="fr_2559"></span>[2560](#fn_2559) And what men
does he think beloved of God, but Moses and the rest of the prophets?
For their prophecies he read, and, having learned from them the doctrine
of the judgment, he thus proclaims it in the first book of the
*Republic*: “When a man begins to think he is soon to die, fear invades
him, and concern about things which had never before entered his head.
And those stories about what goes on in Hades, which tell us that the
man who has here been unjust must there be punished, though formerly
ridiculed, now torment his soul with apprehensions that they may be
true. And he, either through the feebleness of age, or even because he
is now nearer to the things of the other world, views them more
attentively. He becomes, therefore, full of apprehension and dread, and
begins to call himself to account and to consider whether he has done
any one an injury. And that man who finds in his life many iniquities,
and who continually starts from his sleep as children do, lives in
terror, and with a forlorn prospect. But to him who is conscious of no
wrong-doing, sweet hope is the constant companion and good nurse of old
age, as Pindar says. <span id="fr_2560"></span>[2561](#fn_2560) For
this, Socrates, he has elegantly expressed, that ‘whoever leads a life
of holiness and justice, him sweet hope, the nurse of age, accompanies,
cheering his heart, for she powerfully sways the changeful mind of
mortals.’ ” <span id="fr_2561"></span>[2562](#fn_2561) This Plato wrote
in the first book of the *Republic*.
