### <span id="viii.iv.xc-p0.1"></span>Chapter XC.—The stretched-out hands of Moses signified beforehand the cross.

<span id="viii.iv.xc-p1"></span>“Bring us on, then,” said \[Trypho\],
“by the Scriptures, that we may also be persuaded by you; for we know
that He should suffer and be led as a sheep. But prove to us whether He
must be crucified and die so disgracefully and so dishonourably by the
death cursed in the law. <span id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301.md) For
we cannot bring ourselves even to think of this.”

<span id="viii.iv.xc-p3"></span>“You know,” said I, “that what the
prophets said and did they veiled by parables and types, as you admitted
to us; so that it was not easy for all to understand the most \[of what
they said\], since they concealed the truth by these means, that those
who are eager to find out and learn it might do so with much labour.”

<span id="viii.iv.xc-p4"></span>They answered, “We admitted this.”

<span id="viii.iv.xc-p5"></span>“Listen, therefore,” say I, “to what
follows; for Moses first exhibited this seeming curse of Christ’s by the
signs which he made.”

<span id="viii.iv.xc-p6"></span>“Of what \[signs\] do you speak?” said
he.

<span id="viii.iv.xc-p7"></span><span id="viii.iv.xc-p7.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xc-p7.2"></span>“When the people,” replied I, “waged war
with Amalek, and the son of Nave (Nun) by name Jesus (Joshua), led the
fight, Moses himself prayed to God, stretching out both hands, and Hur
with Aaron supported them during the whole day, so that they might not
hang down when he got wearied. For if he gave up any part of this sign,
which was an imitation of the cross, the people were beaten, as is
recorded in the writings of Moses; but if he remained in this form,
Amalek was proportionally defeated, and he who prevailed prevailed by
the cross. For it was not because Moses so prayed that the people were
stronger, but because, while one who bore the name of Jesus (Joshua) was
in the forefront of the battle, he himself made the sign of the cross.
For who of you knows not that the prayer of one who accompanies it with
lamentation and tears, with the body prostrate, or with bended knees,
propitiates God most of all? But in such a manner neither he nor any
other one, while sitting on a stone, prayed. Nor even the stone
symbolized Christ, as I have shown.

<span id="viii.iv.xc-p2"></span> \[This intense abhorrence of the cross
made it worth while to show that these similitudes existed under the
law. They were *ad hominem* appeals, and suited to Jewish modes of
thought.\]
