### <span id="viii.vii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Testimonies to the unity of God.

<span id="viii.vii.ii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.vii.ii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.vii.ii-p1.2"></span>First,
then, Æschylus, <span id="fr_2596"></span>[2597](#fn_2596.md) in expounding
the arrangement of his work, <span id="fr_2597"></span>[2598](#fn_2597.md)
expressed himself also as follows respecting the only God:—

> <span id="viii.vii.ii-p3.1"></span>“Afar from mortals place the holy
> God,  
> Nor ever think that He, like to thyself,  
> In fleshly robes is clad; for all unknown  
> Is the great God to such a worm as thou.  
> Divers similitudes He bears; at times  
> He seems as a consuming fire that burns  
> Unsated; now like water, then again  
> In sable folds of darkness shrouds Himself.  
> Nay, even the very beasts of earth reflect  
> His sacred image; whilst the wind, clouds, rain,  
> The roll of thunder and the lightning flash,  
> Reveal to men their great and sovereign Lord.  
> Before Him sea and rocks, with every fount,  
> And all the water floods, in reverence bend;  
> And as they gaze upon His awful face,  
> Mountains and earth, with the profoundest depths  
> Of ocean, and the highest peaks of hills,  
> Tremble: for He is Lord Omnipotent;  
> And this the glory is of God Most High.”  

<span id="viii.vii.ii-p4"></span><span
id="viii.vii.ii-p4.1"></span><span id="viii.vii.ii-p4.2"></span>But he
was not the only man initiated in the knowledge of God; for Sophocles
also thus describes the nature of the only Creator of all things, the
One God:—

> <span id="viii.vii.ii-p4.3"></span>“There is one God, in truth there
> is but one,  
> Who made the heavens and the broad earth beneath,  
> The glancing waves of ocean, and the winds;  
> But many of us mortals err in heart,  
> And set up, for a solace in our woes,  
> Images of the gods in stone and brass,  
> Or figures carved in gold or ivory;  
> And, furnishing for these, our handiworks,  
> Both sacrifice and rite magnificent,  
> We think that thus we do a pious work.”  

<span id="viii.vii.ii-p5"></span><span id="viii.vii.ii-p5.1"></span>And
Philemon also, who published many explanations of ancient customs,
shares in the knowledge of the truth; and thus he writes:—

> <span id="viii.vii.ii-p5.2"></span>“Tell me what thoughts of God we
> should conceive?  
> One, all things seeing, yet Himself unseen.”  

<span id="viii.vii.ii-p6"></span><span
id="viii.vii.ii-p6.1"></span><span id="viii.vii.ii-p6.2"></span><span
id="viii.vii.ii-p6.3"></span>Even Orpheus, too, who introduces three
hundred and sixty gods, will bear testimony in my <span id="page_291">p.
291</span> <span id="viii.vii.ii-Page_291"></span> favour from the tract
called *Diathecæ*, in which he appears to repent of his error by writing
the following:—

> <span id="viii.vii.ii-p6.4"></span>“I’ll speak to those who lawfully
> may hear;  
> All others, ye profane, now close the doors!  
> And, O Musæus, hearken thou to me,  
> Who offspring art of the light-bringing moon.  
> The words I tell thee now are true indeed,  
> And if thou former thoughts of mine hast seen,  
> Let them not rob thee of the blessed life;  
> But rather turn the depths of thine own heart  
> Unto that place where light and knowledge dwell.  
> Take thou the word divine to guide thy steps;  
> And walking well in the straight certain path,  
> Look to the one and universal King,  
> One, self-begotten, and the only One  
> Of whom all things, and we ourselves, are sprung.  
> All things are open to His piercing gaze,  
> While He Himself is still invisible;  
> Present in all His works, though still unseen,  
> He gives to mortals evil out of good,  
> Sending both chilling wars and tearful griefs;  
> And other than the Great King there is none.  
> The clouds for ever settle round His throne;  
> And mortal eyeballs in mere mortal eyes  
> Are weak to see Jove, reigning over all.  
> He sits established in the brazen heavens  
> Upon His throne; and underneath His feet  
> He treads the earth, and stretches His right hand  
> To all the ends of ocean, and around  
> Tremble the mountain ranges, and the streams,  
> The depths, too, of the blue and hoary sea.”  

<span id="viii.vii.ii-p7"></span>He speaks indeed as if he had been an
eyewitness of God’s greatness. And Pythagoras <span
id="fr_2598"></span>[2599](#fn_2598.md) agrees with him when he writes:—

> <span id="viii.vii.ii-p8.2"></span>“Should one in boldness say, Lo, I
> am God!  
> Besides the One—Eternal—Infinite,  
> Then let him from the throne he has usurped  
> Put forth his power and form another globe,  
> Such as we dwell in, saying, This is mine.  
> Nor only so, but in this new domain  
> For ever let him dwell. If this he can,  
> Then verily he is a god proclaimed.”
