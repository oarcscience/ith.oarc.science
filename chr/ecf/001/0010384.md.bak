### <span id="viii.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—What kingdom Christians look for.

id="viii.ii.xi-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.ii.xi-p1.3"></span>And when
you hear that we look for a kingdom, you suppose, without making any
inquiry, that we speak of a human kingdom; whereas we speak of that
which is with God, as appears also from the confession of their faith
made by those who are charged with being Christians, though they know
that death is the punishment awarded to him who so confesses. For if we
looked for a human kingdom, we should also deny our Christ, that we
might not be slain; and we should strive to escape detection, that we
might obtain what we expect. But since our thoughts are not fixed on the
present, we are not concerned when men cut us off; since also death is a
debt which must at all events be paid.
