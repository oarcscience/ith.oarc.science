### <span id="ix.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—The deceitful arts and nefarious practices of Marcus.

<span id="ix.ii.xiv-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>But <span
id="fr_2812"></span>[2813](#fn_2812.md) there is another among these
heretics, Marcus by name, who boasts himself as having improved upon his
master. <span id="ix.ii.xiv-p2.1"></span>He is a perfect adept in
magical impostures, and by this means drawing away a great number of
men, and not a few women, he has induced them to join themselves to him,
as to one who is possessed of the greatest knowledge and perfection, and
who has received the highest power from the invisible and ineffable
regions above. Thus it appears as if he really were the precursor of
Antichrist. For, joining the buffooneries of Anaxilaus <span
id="fr_2813"></span>[2814](#fn_2813.md) to the craftiness of the *magi*, as
they are called, he is regarded by his senseless and cracked-brain
followers as working miracles by these means.

<span id="ix.ii.xiv-p4"></span>2. Pretending <span
id="fr_2814"></span>[2815](#fn_2814.md) to consecrate cups mixed with wine,
and protracting to great length the word of invocation, he contrives to
give them a purple and reddish colour, so that Charis, <span
id="fr_2815"></span>[2816](#fn_2815.md) who is one of those that are
superior to all things, should be thought to drop her own blood into
that cup through means of his invocation, and that thus those who are
present should be led to rejoice to taste of that cup, in order that, by
so doing, the Charis, who is set forth by this magician, may also flow
into them. Again, handing mixed cups to the women, he bids them
consecrate these in his presence. When this has been done, he himself
produces another cup of much larger size than that which the deluded
woman has consecrated, and pouring from the smaller one consecrated by
the woman into that which has been brought forward by himself, he at the
same time pronounces these words: “May that Charis who is before all
things, and who transcends all knowledge and speech, fill thine inner
man, and multiply in thee her own knowledge, by sowing the grain of
mustard seed in thee as in good soil.” Repeating certain other like
words, and thus goading on the wretched woman \[to madness\], he then
appears a worker of wonders when the large cup is seen to have been
filled out of the small one, so as even to overflow by what has been
obtained from it. By accomplishing several other similar things, he has
completely deceived many, and drawn them away after him.

<span id="ix.ii.xiv-p7"></span>3. <span id="ix.ii.xiv-p7.1"></span>It
appears probable enough that this man possesses a demon as his familiar
spirit, by means of whom he seems able to prophesy, <span
id="fr_2816"></span>[2817](#fn_2816.md) and also enables as many as he
counts worthy to be partakers of his Charis themselves to prophesy.
<span id="ix.ii.xiv-p8.2"></span>He devotes himself especially to women,
and those such as are well-bred, and elegantly attired, and of great
wealth, whom he frequently seeks to draw after him, by addressing them
in such seductive words as these: “I am eager to make thee a partaker of
my Charis, since the Father of all doth continually behold thy angel
before His face. Now the place of thy angel is among us: <span
id="fr_2817"></span>[2818](#fn_2817.md) it behoves us to become one.
Receive first from me and by me \[the gift of\] Charis. Adorn thyself as
a bride who is expecting her bridegroom, that thou mayest be what I am,
and I what thou art. Establish the germ of light in thy nuptial chamber.
Receive from me a spouse, and become receptive of him, while thou art
received by him. Behold Charis has descended upon thee; open thy mouth
and prophesy.” On the woman replying, “I have never at any time
prophesied, nor do I know how to prophesy;” then engaging, for the
second time, in certain invocations, so as to astound his deluded
victim, he says to her, “Open thy mouth, speak whatsoever occurs to
thee, and thou shalt prophesy.” She then, vainly puffed up and elated by
these words, and greatly excited in soul by the expectation that it is
herself who is to prophesy, her heart beating violently \[from
emotion\], reaches the requisite pitch of audacity, and idly as well as
impudently utters some nonsense as it happens to occur to her, such as
might be expected <span id="page_335">p. 335</span> <span
id="ix.ii.xiv-Page_335"></span> from one heated by an empty spirit.
(Referring to this, one superior to me has observed, that the soul is
both audacious and impudent when heated with empty air.) Henceforth she
reckons herself a prophetess, and expresses her thanks to Marcus for
having imparted to her of his own Charis. She then makes the effort to
reward him, not only by the gift of her possessions (in which way he has
collected a very large fortune), but also by yielding up to him her
person, desiring in every way to be united to him, that she may become
altogether one with him.

<span id="ix.ii.xiv-p10"></span>4. But already some of the most faithful
women, possessed of the fear of God, and not being deceived (whom,
nevertheless, he did his best to seduce like the rest by bidding them
prophesy), abhorring and execrating him, have withdrawn from such a vile
company of revellers. This they have done, as being well aware that the
gift of prophecy is not conferred on men by Marcus, the magician, but
that only those to whom God sends His grace from above possess the
divinely-bestowed power of prophesying; and then they speak where and
when God pleases, and not when Marcus orders them to do so. For that
which commands is greater and of higher authority than that which is
commanded, inasmuch as the former rules, while the latter is in a state
of subjection. If, then, Marcus, or any one else, does command,— as
these are accustomed continually at their feasts to play at drawing
lots, and \[in accordance with the lot\] to command one another to
prophesy, giving forth as oracles what is in harmony with their own
desires,—it will follow that he who commands is greater and of higher
authority than the prophetic spirit, though he is but a man, which is
impossible. But such spirits as are commanded by these men, and speak
when they desire it, are earthly and weak, audacious and impudent, sent
forth by Satan for the seduction and perdition of those who do not hold
fast that well-compacted faith which they received at first through the
Church.

<span id="ix.ii.xiv-p11"></span>5. Moreover, that this Marcus compounds
philters and love-potions, in order to insult the persons of some of
these women, if not of all, those of them who have returned to the
Church of God— a thing which frequently occurs—have acknowledged,
confessing, too, that they have been defiled by him, and that they were
filled with a burning passion towards him. A sad example of this
occurred in the case of a certain Asiatic, one of our deacons, who had
received him (Marcus) into his house. His wife, a woman of remarkable
beauty, fell a victim both in mind and body to this magician, and, for a
long time, travelled about with him. At last, when, with no small
difficulty, the brethren had converted her, she spent her whole time in
the exercise of public confession, <span
id="fr_2818"></span>[2819](#fn_2818.md) weeping over and lamenting the
defilement which she had received from this magician.

<span id="ix.ii.xiv-p13"></span>6. Some of his disciples, too, addicting
themselves <span id="fr_2819"></span>[2820](#fn_2819.md) to the same
practices, have deceived many silly women, and defiled them. They
proclaim themselves as being “perfect,” so that no one can be compared
to them with respect to the immensity of their knowledge, nor even were
you to mention Paul or Peter, or any other of the apostles. They assert
that they themselves know more than all others, and that they alone have
imbibed the greatness of the knowledge of that power which is
unspeakable. They also maintain that they have attained to a height
above all power, and that therefore they are free in every respect to
act as they please, having no one to fear in anything. For they affirm,
that because of the “Redemption” <span
id="fr_2820"></span>[2821](#fn_2820.md) it has come to pass that they can
neither be apprehended, nor even seen by the judge. But even if he
should happen to lay hold upon them, then they might simply repeat these
words, while standing in his presence along with the “Redemption:” “O
thou, who sittest beside God, <span id="fr_2821"></span>[2822](#fn_2821.md)
and the mystical, eternal Sige, thou through whom the angels
(mightiness), who continually behold the face of the Father, having thee
as their guide and introducer, do derive their forms <span
id="fr_2822"></span>[2823](#fn_2822.md) from above, which she in the
greatness of her daring inspiring with mind on account of the goodness
of the Propator, produced us as their images, having her mind then
intent upon the things above, as in a dream,— behold, the judge is at
hand, and the crier orders me to make my defence. But do thou, as being
acquainted with the affairs of both, present the cause of both of us to
the judge, inasmuch as it is in reality but one cause.” <span
id="fr_2823"></span>[2824](#fn_2823.md) Now, as soon as the Mother hears
these words, she puts the Homeric <span
id="fr_2824"></span>[2825](#fn_2824.md) helmet of Pluto upon them, so that
they may invisibly escape the judge. And then she immediately catches
them up, conducts them into the bridal chamber, and hands them over to
their consorts.

<span id="ix.ii.xiv-p20"></span> <span id="page_336">p. 336</span> <span
id="ix.ii.xiv-Page_336"></span> 7. Such are the words and deeds by
which, in our own district of the Rhone, they have deluded many women,
who have their consciences seared as with a hot iron. <span
id="fr_2825"></span>[2826](#fn_2825.md) Some of them, indeed, make a public
confession of their sins; but others of them are ashamed to do this, and
in a tacit kind of way, despairing of \[attaining to\] the life of God,
have, some of them, apostatized altogether; while others hesitate
between the two courses, and incur that which is implied in the proverb,
“neither without nor within;” possessing this as the fruit from the seed
of the children of knowledge.

<span id="ix.ii.xiv-p15"></span> Grabe is of opinion that reference is
made in this term to an imprecatory formula in use among the Marcosians,
analogous to the form of thanksgiving employed night and morning by the
Jews for their redemption from Egypt. Harvey refers the word to the
*second* baptism practised among these and other heretics, by which it
was supposed they were removed from the cognizance of the Demiurge, who
is styled the “judge” in the close of the above sentence.

<span id="ix.ii.xiv-p18"></span> The syntax in this long sentence is
very confused, but the meaning is tolerably plain. The gist of it is,
that these Gnostics, as being the spiritual seed, claimed a
consubstantiality with Achamoth, and consequently escaped from the
material Demiurge, and attained at last to the Pleroma.
