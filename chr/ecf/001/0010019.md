### <span id="ii.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—We should obey God rather than the authors of sedition.

<span id="ii.ii.xiv-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xiv-p1.2"></span>It is right and holy therefore, men and
brethren, rather to obey God than to follow those who, through pride and
sedition, have become the leaders of a detestable emulation. For we
shall incur no slight injury, but rather great danger, if we rashly
yield ourselves to the inclinations of men who aim at exciting strife
and tumults, so as to draw us away from what is good. Let us be kind one
to another after the pattern of the tender mercy and benignity of our
Creator. For it is written, “The kind-hearted shall inhabit the land,
and the guiltless shall be left upon it, but transgressors shall be
destroyed from off the face of it.” <span id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md)
And again \[the Scripture\] saith, “I saw the ungodly highly exalted,
and lifted up like the cedars of Lebanon: I passed by, and, behold, he
was not; and I diligently sought his place, and could not find it.
Preserve innocence, and look on equity: for there shall be a remnant to
the peaceful man.” <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md)
