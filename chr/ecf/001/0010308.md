### <span id="v.xviii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Examples of youthful devotedness.

<span id="v.xviii.iv-p1"></span>Moreover, the wise Daniel, while he was
a young man, passed judgment on certain vigorous old man, <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364.md) showing them that they were
abandoned wretches, and not \[worthy to be reckoned\] elders, and that,
though Jews by extraction, they were Canaanites in practice. And
Jeremiah, when on account of his youth he declined the office of a
prophet entrusted to him by God, was addressed in these words: “Say not,
I am a youth; for thou shalt go to all those to whom I send thee, and
thou shalt speak according to all that I command thee; because I am with
thee.” <span id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365.md) And the wise Solomon,
when only in the twelfth year of his age, <span
id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366.md) had wisdom to decide the important
question concerning the children of the two women, <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367.md) when it was unknown to whom these
respectively belonged; so that the whole people were astonished at such
wisdom in a child, and venerated him as being not a mere youth, but a
full-grown man. And he solved the hard questions of the queen of the
Ethiopians, which had profit in them as the streams of the Nile \[have
fertility\], in such a manner that that woman, <span id="page_121">p.
121</span> <span id="v.xviii.iv-Page_121"></span> though herself so
wise, was beyond measure astonished. <span
id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368.md)

“cruel old men,” which perhaps suits the reference better.
