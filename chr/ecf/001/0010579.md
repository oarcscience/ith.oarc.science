### <span id="viii.iv.cxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXVIII.—He exhorts to repentance before Christ comes; in whom Christians, since they believe, are far more religious than Jews.

<span id="viii.iv.cxviii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxviii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxviii-p1.2"></span>“So that you ought rather to desist from
the love of strife, and repent before the great day of judgment come,
wherein all those of your tribes who have pierced this Christ shall
mourn as I have shown has been declared by the Scriptures. And I have
explained that the Lord swore, ‘after the order of Melchizedek,’ <span
id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392.md) and what this prediction means; and
the prophecy of Isaiah which says, ‘His burial is taken away from the
midst,’ <span id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393.md) I have already said,
referred to the future burying and rising again of Christ; and I have
frequently remarked that this very Christ is the Judge of all the living
and the dead. And Nathan likewise, speaking to David about Him, thus
continued: ‘I will be His Father, and He shall be my Son; and my mercy
shall I not take away from Him, as I did from them that went before Him;
and I will establish Him in my house, and in His kingdom for
ever.’ <span id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394.md) And Ezekiel says,
‘There shall be no other prince in the house but He.’ <span
id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395.md) <span
id="viii.iv.cxviii-p5.2"></span>For He is the chosen Priest and eternal
King, the Christ, inasmuch as He is the Son of God; and do not suppose
that Isaiah or the other prophets speak of sacrifices of blood or
libations being presented at the altar on His second advent, but of true
and spiritual praises and giving of thanks. And we have not in vain
believed in Him, and have not been led astray by those who taught us
such doctrines; but this has come to pass through the wonderful
foreknowledge of God, in order that we, through the calling of the new
and eternal covenant, that is, of Christ, might be found more
intelligent and God-fearing than yourselves, who are considered to be
lovers of God and men of understanding, but are not. Isaiah, filled with
admiration of this, said: ‘And kings shall shut their mouths: for those
to whom no announcement has been made in regard to Him <span
id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396.md) shall see; and those who heard not
shall understand. Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom is the
arm of the Lord revealed?’ <span id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397.md)

<span id="viii.iv.cxviii-p8"></span>“And in repeating this, <span
id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398.md) Trypho,” I continued, “as far as is
allowable, I endeavour to do so for the sake of those who came with you
to-day, yet briefly and concisely.”

<span id="viii.iv.cxviii-p10"></span>Then he replied, “You do well; and
though you repeat the same things at considerable length, be assured
that I and my companions listen with pleasure.”
