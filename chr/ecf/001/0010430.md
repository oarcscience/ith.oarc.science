### <span id="viii.ii.lvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LVII.—And cause persecution.

<span id="viii.ii.lvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lvii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.lvii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lvii-p1.3"></span>Nor can the devils persuade men that there
will be no conflagration for the punishment of the wicked; as they were
unable to effect that Christ should be hidden after He came. <span
id="viii.ii.lvii-p1.4"></span>But this only can they effect, that they
who live irrationally, and were brought up licentiously in wicked
customs, and are prejudiced in their own opinions, should kill and hate
us; whom we not only do not hate, but, as is proved, pity and endeavour
to lead to repentance. For we do not fear death, since it is
acknowledged we must surely die; and there is nothing new, but all
things continue the same in this administration of things; and if
satiety overtakes those who enjoy even one year of these things, they
ought to give heed to our doctrines, that they may live eternally free
both from suffering and from want. But if they believe that there is
nothing after death, but declare that those who die pass into
insensibility, then they become our benefactors when they set us free
from sufferings and necessities of this life, and prove themselves to be
wicked, and inhuman, and bigoted. For they kill us with no intention of
delivering us, but cut us off that we may be deprived of life and
pleasure.
