### <span id="viii.iv.lxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXIV.—The beginning of [Ps. xcvi.](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.iv.lxxiv-p0.2"></span> is attributed to the Father \[by Trypho\]. But \[it refers\] to Christ by these words: “Tell ye among the nations that the Lord,” etc.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxiv-p1"></span>Then Trypho said, “We know that you
quoted these because we asked you. But it does not appear to me that
this Psalm which you quoted last from the words of David refers to any
other than the Father and Maker of the heavens and earth. You, however,
asserted that it referred to Him who suffered, whom you also are eagerly
endeavouring to prove to be Christ.”

<span id="viii.iv.lxxiv-p2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxiv-p2.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxiv-p2.2"></span><span id="viii.iv.lxxiv-p2.3"></span>And
I answered, “Attend to me, I beseech you, while I speak of the statement
which the Holy Spirit gave utterance to in this Psalm; and you shall
know that I speak not sinfully, and that we <span
id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224.md) are not really bewitched; for so
you shall be enabled of yourselves to understand many other statements
made by the Holy Spirit. ‘Sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the
Lord, all the earth: sing unto the Lord, and bless His name; show forth
His salvation from day to day, His wonderful works among all people.’ He
bids the inhabitants of all the earth, who have known the mystery of
this salvation, i.e., the suffering of Christ, by which He saved them,
sing and give praises to God the Father of all things, and recognise
that He is to be praised and feared, and that He is the Maker of heaven
and earth, who effected this salvation in behalf of the human race, who
also was crucified and was dead, and who was deemed worthy by Him (God)
to reign over all the earth. As \[is clearly seen <span
id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225.md) \] also by the land into which \[He
said\] He would <span id="page_236">p. 236</span> <span
id="viii.iv.lxxiv-Page_236"></span> bring \[your fathers\]; \[for He
thus speaks\]: <span id="fr_2226"></span>[2227](#fn_2226.md) ‘This people
\[shall go a whoring after other gods\], and shall forsake Me, and shall
break my covenant which I made with them in that day; and I will forsake
them, and will turn away My face from them; and they shall be
devoured, <span id="fr_2227"></span>[2228](#fn_2227.md) and many evils and
afflictions shall find them out; and they shall say in that day, Because
the Lord my God is not amongst us, these misfortunes have found us out.
And I shall certainly turn away My face from them in that day, on
account of all the evils which they have committed, in that they have
turned to other gods.’ <span id="fr_2228"></span>[2229](#fn_2228.md)

<span id="viii.iv.lxxiv-p3"></span> In text, “you.” Maranus suggests, as
far better, “we.”

<span id="fn_2225"></span>[235:2226](0010535.htm#fr_2225.md) <span
id="viii.iv.lxxiv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.lxxiv-p4"></span> Something is here wanting; the
suggested reading of Maranus has been adopted. \[As to omissions between
this Chapter and the next, critics are not agreed. The Benedictine
editors see no proofs of them.\]

<span id="viii.iv.lxxiv-p7"></span> The first conference seems to have
ended hereabout. \[It occupied two days. But the student must consult
the learned note of Kaye (*Justin Martyr*, p. 20. Rivingtons, London.
1853).\]
