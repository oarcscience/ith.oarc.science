### <span id="viii.iv.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—No salvation to the Jews except through Christ.

<span id="viii.iv.xxvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxvi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xxvi-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxvi-p1.3"></span>And I replied, “I do not say so; but those
who have persecuted and do persecute Christ, if they do not repent,
shall not inherit anything on the holy mountain. But the Gentiles, who
have believed on Him, and have repented of the sins which they have
committed, they shall receive the inheritance along with the patriarchs
and the prophets, and the just men who are descended from Jacob, even
although they neither keep the Sabbath, nor are circumcised, nor observe
the feasts. Assuredly they shall receive the holy inheritance of God.
For God speaks by Isaiah thus: ‘I, the Lord God, have called Thee in
righteousness, and will hold Thine hand, and will strengthen Thee; and I
have given Thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the
Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out them that are
bound from the chains, and those who sit in darkness from the
prison-house.’ <span id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012.md) And again:
‘Lift up a standard <span id="fr_2013"></span>[2014](#fn_2013.md) for the
people; for, lo, the Lord has made it heard unto the end of the earth.
Say ye to the daughters of Zion, Behold, thy Saviour has come; having
His reward, and His work before His face: and He shall call it a holy
nation, redeemed by the Lord. And thou shalt be called a city sought
out, and not forsaken. Who is this that cometh from Edom? in red
garments from Bosor? This that is beautiful in apparel, going up with
great strength? I speak righteousness, and the judgment of salvation.
Why are Thy garments red, and Thine apparel as from the trodden
wine-press? Thou art full of the trodden grape. I have trodden the
wine-press all alone, and of the people there is no man with Me; and I
have trampled them in fury, and crushed them to the ground, and spilled
their blood on the earth. For the day of retribution has come upon them,
and the year of redemption is present. And I looked, and there was none
to help; and I considered, and none assisted: and My arm delivered; and
My fury came on them, and I trampled them in My fury, and spilled their
blood on the earth.’ ” <span id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014.md)
