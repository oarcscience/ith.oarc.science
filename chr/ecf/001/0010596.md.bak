### <span id="viii.iv.cxxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXXV.—Christ is king of Israel, and Christians are the Israelitic race.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxxv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxxv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.cxxxv-p1.2"></span>“And
when Scripture says, ‘I am the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, who
have made known Israel your King,’ <span
id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469.md) will you not understand that truly
Christ is the everlasting King? For you are aware that Jacob the son of
Isaac was never a king. And therefore Scripture again, explaining to us,
says what king is meant by Jacob and Israel: ‘Jacob is my Servant, I
will uphold Him; and Israel is mine Elect, my soul shall receive Him. I
have given Him my Spirit; and He shall bring forth judgment to the
Gentiles. He shall not cry, and His voice shall not be heard without.
The bruised reed He shall not break, and the smoking flax He shall not
quench, until He shall bring forth judgment to victory. He shall shine,
and shall not be broken, until He set judgment on the earth. And in His
name shall the Gentiles trust.’ <span
id="fr_2470"></span>[2471](#fn_2470.md) Then is it Jacob the patriarch in
whom the Gentiles and yourselves shall trust? or is it not Christ? <span
id="viii.iv.cxxxv-p3.2"></span>As, therefore, Christ is the Israel and
the Jacob, even so we, who have been quarried out from the bowels of
Christ, are the true Israelitic race. But let us attend rather to the
very word: ‘And I will bring forth,’ He says, ‘the seed out of Jacob,
and out of Judah: and it shall inherit My holy mountain; and Mine Elect
and My servants shall possess the inheritance, and shall dwell there;
and there shall be folds of flocks in the thicket, and the valley of
Achor shall be a resting-place of cattle for the people who have sought
Me. But as for you, who forsake Me, and forget My holy mountain, and
prepare a table for demons, and fill out drink for the demon, I shall
give you to the sword. You shall all fall with a slaughter; for I called
you, and you hearkened not, and did evil before me, and did choose that
wherein I delighted not.’ <span id="fr_2471"></span>[2472](#fn_2471.md)
Such are the words of Scripture; understand, therefore, that the seed of
Jacob now referred to is something else, and not, as may be supposed,
spoken of your people. For it is not possible for the seed of Jacob to
leave an entrance for the descendants of Jacob, or for \[God\] to have
accepted the very same persons whom He had reproached with unfitness for
the inheritance, and promise it to them again; but as there the prophet
says, ‘And now, O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of
the Lord; for He has sent away His people, the house of Jacob, because
their land was full, as at the first, of soothsayers and
divinations;’ <span id="fr_2472"></span>[2473](#fn_2472.md) even so it is
necessary for us here to observe that there are two seeds of Judah, and
two races, as there are two houses of Jacob: the one begotten by blood
and flesh, the other by faith and the Spirit.
