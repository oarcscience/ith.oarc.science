### <span id="ii.ii.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—We are justified not by our own works, but by faith.

<span id="ii.ii.xxxii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxii-p1.1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxxii-p1.2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxii-p1.3"></span>Whosoever will candidly consider each
particular, will recognise the greatness of the gifts which were given
by him. <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) For from him <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) have sprung the priests and all the
Levites who minister at the altar of God. From him also \[was
descended\] our Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh. <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) From him \[arose\] kings, princes, and
rulers of the race of Judah. Nor are his other tribes in small glory,
inasmuch as God had promised, “Thy seed shall be as the stars of
heaven.” <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) All these, therefore,
were highly honoured, and made great, not for their own sake, or for
their own works, or for the righteousness which they wrought, but
through the operation of His will. And we, too, being called by His will
in Christ Jesus, are not justified by ourselves, nor by our own wisdom,
or understanding, or godliness, or works which we have wrought in
holiness of heart; but by that faith through which, from the beginning,
Almighty God has justified all men; to whom be glory for ever and ever.
Amen.

<span id="ii.ii.xxxii-p2"></span> The meaning is here very doubtful.
Some translate “the gifts which were given to Jacob by Him,” i.e., God.
