### <span id="ix.ii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Passages from Moses, which the heretics pervert to the support of their hypothesis.

<span id="ix.ii.xix-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.ii.xix-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.ii.xix-p1.2"></span>And while they affirm such things as these
concerning the creation, every one of them generates something new, day
by day, according to his ability; for no one is deemed “perfect,” who
does not develop among them some mighty fictions. It is thus necessary,
first, to indicate what things they metamorphose \[to their own use\]
out of the prophetical writings, and next, to refute them. <span
id="ix.ii.xix-p1.3"></span>Moses, then, they declare, by his mode of
beginning the account of the creation, has at the commencement pointed
out the mother of all things when he says, “In the beginning God created
the heaven and the earth;” <span id="fr_2878"></span>[2879](#fn_2878)
for, as they maintain, by naming these four,—God, beginning, heaven, and
earth,—he set forth their Tetrad. Indicating also its invisible and
hidden nature, he said, “Now the earth was invisible and
unformed.” <span id="fr_2879"></span>[2880](#fn_2879) They will have it,
moreover, that he spoke of the second Tetrad, the offspring of the
first, in this way—by naming an abyss and darkness, in which were also
water, and the Spirit moving upon the water. Then, proceeding to mention
the Decad, he names light, day, night, the firmament, the evening, the
morning, dry land, sea, plants, and, in the tenth place, trees. Thus, by
means of these ten names, he indicated the ten Æons. The power of the
Duodecad, again, was shadowed forth by him thus:—He names the sun, moon,
stars, seasons, years, whales, fishes, reptiles, birds, quadrupeds, wild
beasts, and after all these, in the twelfth place, man. Thus they teach
that the Triacontad was spoken of through Moses by the Spirit. Moreover,
man also, being formed after the image of the power above, had in
himself that ability which flows from the one source. This ability was
seated in the region of the brain, from which four faculties proceed,
after the image of the Tetrad above, and these are called: the first,
*sight*, the second, *hearing*, the third, *smell*, and the
fourth, <span id="fr_2880"></span>[2881](#fn_2880) *taste*. And they say
that the Ogdoad is indicated by man in this way: that he possesses two
ears, the like number of eyes, also two nostrils, and a twofold taste,
namely, of bitter and sweet. Moreover, they teach that the whole man
contains the entire image of the Triacontad as follows: In his hands, by
means of his fingers, he bears the Decad; and in his whole body the
Duodecad, inasmuch as his body is divided into twelve members; for they
portion that out, as the body of Truth is divided by them—a point of
which we have already spoken. <span id="fr_2881"></span>[2882](#fn_2881)
But the Ogdoad, as being unspeakable and invisible, is understood as
hidden in the viscera.

<span id="ix.ii.xix-p6"></span>2. Again, they assert that the sun, the
great light-giver, was formed on the fourth day, with a reference to the
number of the Tetrad. So also, according to them, the courts <span
id="fr_2882"></span>[2883](#fn_2882) of the tabernacle constructed by
Moses, being composed of fine linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet,
pointed to the same image. Moreover, they maintain that the long robe of
the priest falling over his feet, as being adorned with four rows of
precious stones, <span id="fr_2883"></span>[2884](#fn_2883) indicates
the Tetrad; and if there are any other things in the Scriptures which
can possibly be dragged into the number *four*, they declare that these
had their being with a view to the Tetrad. The Ogdoad, again, was shown
as follows:—They affirm that man was formed on the eighth day, for
sometimes they will have him to have been made on the sixth day, and
sometimes on the eighth, unless, perchance, they mean that his earthly
part was formed on the sixth day, but his fleshly part on the eighth,
for these two things are distinguished by them. Some of them also hold
that one man was formed after the image and likeness of God,
masculo-feminine, and that this was the spiritual man; and that another
man was formed out of the earth.

<span id="ix.ii.xix-p9"></span>3. Further, they declare that the
arrangement made with respect to the ark in the Deluge, by means of
which eight persons were saved, <span
id="fr_2884"></span>[2885](#fn_2884) most clearly indicates the Ogdoad
which brings salvation. David also shows forth the same, as holding the
eighth place in point of age among his brethren. <span
id="fr_2885"></span>[2886](#fn_2885) Moreover, that circumcision which
took place on the eighth day, <span id="fr_2886"></span>[2887](#fn_2886)
represented the circumcision of the Ogdoad above. In a word, whatever
they find in the Scriptures capable of being referred to the number
*eight*, they declare to fulfil the mystery of the Ogdoad. With respect,
again, to the Decad, they maintain that it is indicated by those ten
nations which God promised to Abraham for a possession. <span
id="fr_2887"></span>[2888](#fn_2887) The arrangement also made by Sarah
when, after ten years, she gave <span
id="fr_2888"></span>[2889](#fn_2888) her handmaid Hagar to him, that by
her he might have a son, showed the same thing. Moreover, the servant of
Abraham who was sent to Rebekah, and presented her at the well with ten
bracelets of gold, and her <span id="page_344">p. 344</span> <span
id="ix.ii.xix-Page_344"></span> brethren who detained her for ten
days; <span id="fr_2889"></span>[2890](#fn_2889) Jeroboam also, who
received the ten sceptres <span id="fr_2890"></span>[2891](#fn_2890)
(tribes), and the ten courts <span id="fr_2891"></span>[2892](#fn_2891)
of the tabernacle, and the columns of ten cubits <span
id="fr_2892"></span>[2893](#fn_2892) \[high\], and the ten sons of Jacob
who were at first sent into Egypt to buy corn, <span
id="fr_2893"></span>[2894](#fn_2893) and the ten apostles to whom the
Lord appeared after His resurrection,—Thomas <span
id="fr_2894"></span>[2895](#fn_2894) being absent,—represented,
according to them, the invisible Decad.

<span id="ix.ii.xix-p21"></span>4. As to the Duodecad, in connection
with which the mystery of the passion of the defect occurred, from which
passion they maintain that all things visible were framed, they assert
that is to be found strikingly and manifestly everywhere \[in
Scripture\]. For they declare that the twelve sons of Jacob, <span
id="fr_2895"></span>[2896](#fn_2895) from whom also sprung twelve
tribes,— the breastplate of the high priest, which bore twelve precious
stones and twelve little bells, <span
id="fr_2896"></span>[2897](#fn_2896) —the twelve stones which were
placed by Moses at the foot of the mountain, <span
id="fr_2897"></span>[2898](#fn_2897) —the same number which was placed
by Joshua in the river, <span id="fr_2898"></span>[2899](#fn_2898) and
again, on the other side, the bearers of the ark of the covenant, <span
id="fr_2899"></span>[2900](#fn_2899) —those stones which were set up by
Elijah when the heifer was offered as a burnt-offering; <span
id="fr_2900"></span>[2901](#fn_2900) the number, too, of the apostles;
and, in fine, every event which embraces in it the number *twelve*,—set
forth their Duodecad. And then the union of all these, which is called
the Triacontad, they strenuously endeavour to demonstrate by the ark of
Noah, the height of which was thirty cubits; <span
id="fr_2901"></span>[2902](#fn_2901) by the case of Samuel, who assigned
Saul the chief place among thirty guests; <span
id="fr_2902"></span>[2903](#fn_2902) by David, when for thirty days he
concealed himself in the field; <span
id="fr_2903"></span>[2904](#fn_2903) by those who entered along with him
into the cave; also by the fact that the length (height) of the holy
tabernacle was thirty cubits; <span id="fr_2904"></span>[2905](#fn_2904)
and if they meet with any other like numbers, they still apply these to
their Triacontad.
