### <span id="viii.viii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—The resurrection of the flesh is not impossible.

<span id="viii.viii.v-p1"></span><span id="viii.viii.v-p1.1"></span>But
again, of those who maintain that the flesh has no resurrection, some
assert that it is impossible; others that, considering how vile and
despicable the flesh is, it is not fit that God should raise it; and
others, that it did not at the first receive the promise. First, then,
in respect of those who say that it is impossible for God to raise it,
it seems to me that I should show that they are ignorant, professing as
they do in word that they are believers, yet by their works proving
themselves to be unbelieving, even more <span id="page_296">p.
296</span> <span id="viii.viii.v-Page_296"></span> unbelieving than the
unbelievers. For, seeing that all the heathen believe in their idols,
and are persuaded that to them all things are possible (as even their
poet Homer says, <span id="fr_2618"></span>[2619](#fn_2618.md) “The gods
can do all things, and that easily;” and he added the word “easily” that
he might bring out the greatness of the power of the gods), many do seem
to be more unbelieving than they. For if the heathen believe in their
gods, which are idols (“which have ears, and they hear not; they have
eyes, and they see not” <span id="fr_2619"></span>[2620](#fn_2619) .md),
that they can do all things, though they be but devils, as saith the
Scripture, “The gods of the nations are devils,” <span
id="fr_2620"></span>[2621](#fn_2620.md) much more ought we, who hold the
right, excellent, and true faith, to believe in our God, since also we
have proofs \[of His power\], first in the creation of the first man,
for he was made from the earth by God; and this is sufficient evidence
of God’s power; and then they who observe things can see how men are
generated one by another, and can marvel in a still greater degree that
from a little drop of moisture so grand a living creature is formed. And
certainly if this were only recorded in a promise, and not seen
accomplished, this too would be much more incredible than the other; but
it is rendered more credible by accomplishment. <span
id="fr_2621"></span>[2622](#fn_2621.md) But even in the case of the
resurrection the Saviour has shown us accomplishments, of which we will
in a little speak. But now we are demonstrating that the resurrection of
the flesh is possible, asking pardon of the children of the Church if we
adduce arguments which seem to be secular <span
id="fr_2622"></span>[2623](#fn_2622.md) and physical: <span
id="fr_2623"></span>[2624](#fn_2623.md) first, because to God nothing is
secular, not even the world itself, for it is His workmanship; and
secondly, because we are conducting our argument so as to meet
unbelievers. For if we argued with believers, it were enough to say that
we believe; but now we must proceed by demonstrations. The foregoing
proofs are indeed quite sufficient to evince the possibility of the
resurrection of the flesh; but since these men are exceedingly
unbelieving, we will further adduce a more convincing argument still,
—an argument drawn not from faith, for they are not within its scope,
but from their own mother unbelief,—I mean, of course, from physical
reasons. For if by such arguments we prove to them that the resurrection
of the flesh is possible, they are certainly worthy of great contempt if
they can be persuaded neither by the deliverances of faith nor by the
arguments of the world.
