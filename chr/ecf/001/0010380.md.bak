### <span id="viii.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Each Christian must be tried by his own life.

<span id="viii.ii.vii-p1"></span>But some one will say, Some have ere
now been arrested and convicted as evil-doers. For <span
id="page_165">p. 165</span> <span id="viii.ii.vii-Page_165"></span> you
condemn many, many a time, after inquiring into the life of each of the
accused severally, but not on account of those of whom we have been
speaking. <span id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776.md) <span
id="viii.ii.vii-p2.1"></span>And this we acknowledge, that as among the
Greeks those who teach such theories as please themselves are all called
by the one name “Philosopher,” though their doctrines be diverse, so
also among the Barbarians this name on which accusations are accumulated
is the common property of those who are and those who seem wise. For all
are called Christians. <span id="viii.ii.vii-p2.2"></span><span
id="viii.ii.vii-p2.3"></span>Wherefore we demand that the deeds of all
those who are accused to you be judged, in order that each one who is
convicted may be punished as an evil-doer, and not as a Christian; and
if it is clear that any one is blameless, that he may be acquitted,
since by the mere fact of his being a Christian he does no wrong. <span
id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777.md) For we will not require that you
punish our accusers; <span id="fr_1778"></span>[1779](#fn_1778.md) they
being sufficiently punished by their present wickedness and ignorance of
what is right.
