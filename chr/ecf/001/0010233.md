### <span id="v.xi.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="v.xi.i-p1"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.xi.i-p1.1"></span>Inasmuch</span> as your name, which is greatly
beloved, is acceptable to me in God, \[your name\] which ye have
acquired by nature, through a right and just will, and also by the faith
and love of Jesus Christ our Saviour, and ye are imitators of God, and
are fervent in the blood of God, and have speedily completed a work
congenial to you; \[for\] when ye heard that I was bound, <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147) so as to be able to do nothing for
the sake of the common name and hope (and I hope, through your prayers,
that I may be devoured by beasts at Rome, so that by means of this of
which I have been accounted worthy, I may be endowed with strength to be
a disciple of God), ye were diligent to come and see me. Seeing, then,
that we have become acquainted with your multitude <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148) in the name of God, by Onesimus,
who is your bishop, in love which is unutterable, whom I pray that ye
love in Jesus Christ our Lord, and that all of you imitate his
example, <span id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149) for blessed is He
who has given you such a bishop, even as ye deserve \[to have\]. <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150)
