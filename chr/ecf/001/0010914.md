### <span id="ix.viii.xxxix-p0.1"></span>XXXIX.

<span id="ix.viii.xxxix-p1"></span>Christ, <span
id="fr_4878"></span>[4879](#fn_4878.md) who was called the Son of God
before the ages, was manifested in the fulness of time, in order that He
might cleanse us through His blood, who were under the power of sin,
presenting us as pure sons to His Father, if we yield ourselves
obediently to the chastisement of the Spirit. And in the end of time He
shall come to do away with all evil, and to reconcile all things, in
order that there may be an end of all impurities.
