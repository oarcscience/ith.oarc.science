id="viii.ii.xli-p1.3"></span>And again, in another prophecy, the Spirit
of prophecy, through the same David, intimated that Christ, after He had
been crucified, should reign, and spoke as follows: “Sing to the Lord,
all the earth, and day by day declare His salvation. For great is the
Lord, and greatly to be praised, to be feared above all the gods. For
all the gods of the nations are idols of devils; but God made the
heavens. Glory and praise are before His face, strength and glorying are
in the habitation of His holiness. Give Glory to the Lord, the Father
everlasting. Receive grace, and enter His presence, and worship in His
holy courts. Let all the earth fear before His face; let it be
established, and not shaken. Let them rejoice among the nations. The
Lord hath reigned from the tree.” <span
