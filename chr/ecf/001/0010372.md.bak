## <span id="viii.i-p0.1"></span>Introductory Note to the Writings of Justin Martyr

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span> \[<span
class="upper"><span id="viii.i-p1.2"></span>a.d.</span> 110–165.\] <span
class="upper"><span id="viii.i-p1.3"></span>Justin</span> was a Gentile,
but born in Samaria, near Jacob’s well. He must have been well educated:
he had travelled extensively, and he seems to have been a person
enjoying at least a competence. After trying all other systems, his
elevated tastes and refined perceptions made him a disciple of Socrates
and Plato. So he climbed towards Christ. As he himself narrates the
story of his conversion, it need not be anticipated here. What Plato was
feeling after, he found in Jesus of Nazareth. The conversion of such a
man marks a new era in the gospel history. The sub-apostolic age begins
with the first Christian author,—the founder of theological literature.
It introduced to mankind, as the mother of true philosophy, the despised
teaching of those Galileans to whom their Master had said, “Ye are the
light of the world.”

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>And this is the epoch which forced this
great truth upon the attention of contemplative minds. It was more than
a hundred years since the angels had sung “Good-will to men;” and that
song had now been heard for successive generations, breaking forth from
the lips of sufferers on the cross, among lions, and amid blazing
faggots. Here was a nobler Stoicism that needed interpretation. Not only
choice spirits, despising the herd and boasting of a loftier
intellectual sphere, were its professors; but thousands of men, women,
and children, withdrawing themselves not at all from the ordinary and
humble lot of the people, were inspired by it to live and die heroically
and sublimely, —exhibiting a superiority to revenge and hate entirely
unaccountable, praying for their enemies, and seeking to glorify their
God by love to their fellow-men.

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span>And in spite of Gallios and Neros alike, the
gospel was dispelling the gross darkness. Of this, Pliny’s letter to
Trajan is decisive evidence. Even in Seneca we detect reflections of the
daybreak. Plutarch writes as never a Gentile could have written until
now. Plato is practically surpassed by him in his thoughts upon the
“delays <span id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764.md) of the Divine
Justice.” Hadrian’s address to his soul, in his dying moments, is a
tribute to the new ideas which had been sown in the popular mind. And
now the Antonines, impelled by something in the age, came forward to
reign as “philosophers.” At this moment, Justin Martyr confronts them
like a Daniel. The “little stone” smites the imperial image in the face,
not yet “in the toes.” He tells the professional philosophers on a
throne how false and hollow is all wisdom that is not meant for all
humanity, and that is not capable of leavening the masses. He exposes
the impotency of even Socratic philosophy: he shows, in contrast, the
force that works in the words of Jesus; he points out their regenerating
power. It is the mission of Justin to be a star in the West, leading its
Wise Men to the cradle of Bethlehem.

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span> <span id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span
id="viii.i-Page_160"></span> The writings of Justin are deficient in
charms of style; and, for us, there is something the reverse of
attractive in the forms of thought which he had learned from the
philosophers. <span id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765.md) If Plato had
left us nothing but the Timæus, a Renan would doubtless have reproached
him as of feeble intellectual power. So a dancing-master might criticise
the movements of an athlete, or the writhings of St. Sebastian shot with
arrows. The practical wisdom of Justin using the rhetoric of his times,
and discomfiting false philosophy with its own weapons, is not
appreciated by the fastidious Parisian. But the manly and heroic
pleadings of the man, for a despised people with whom he had boldly
identified himself; the intrepidity with which he defends them before
despots, whose mere caprice might punish him with death; above all, the
undaunted spirit with which he exposes the shame and absurdity of their
inveterate superstition and reproaches the memory of Hadrian whom
Antoninus had deified, as he had deified Antinous of loathsome
history,—these are characteristics which every instinct of the
unvitiated soul delights to honour. Justin cannot be refuted by a sneer.

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span>He wore his philosopher’s gown after his
conversion, as a token that he had attained the only true philosophy.
And seeing, that, after the conflicts and tests of ages, it is the only
philosophy that lasts and lives and triumphs, its discoverer deserves
the homage of mankind. Of the philosophic gown we shall hear again when
we come to Tertullian. <span id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766.md)

<span id="viii.i-p9"></span>The residue of Justin’s history may be found
in The Martyrdom and other pages soon to follow, as well as in the
following <span class="upper"><span id="viii.i-p9.1"></span>Introductory
Note</span> of the able translators, Messrs. Dods and Reith:—

<span id="viii.i-p10"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="viii.i-p10.1"></span>Justin Martyr</span> was born in Flavia
Neapolis, a city of Samaria, the modern Nablous. The date of his birth
is uncertain, but may be fixed about <span class="upper"><span
id="viii.i-p10.2"></span>a.d.</span> 114. His father and grandfather
were probably of Roman origin. Before his conversion to Christianity he
studied in the schools of the philosophers, searching after some
knowledge which should satisfy the cravings of his soul. At last he
became acquainted with Christianity, being at once impressed with the
extraordinary fearlessness which the Christians displayed in the
presence of death, and with the grandeur, stability, and truth of the
teachings of the Old Testament. From this time he acted as an
evangelist, taking every opportunity to proclaim the gospel as the only
safe and certain philosophy, the only way to salvation. It is probable
that he travelled much. We know that he was some time in Ephesus, and he
must have lived for a considerable period in Rome. Probably he settled
in Rome as a Christian teacher. While he was there, the philosophers,
especially the Cynics, plotted against him, and he sealed his testimony
to the truth by martyrdom.

<span id="viii.i-p11"></span>The principal facts of Justin’s life are
gathered from his own writings. There is little clue to dates. It is
agreed on all hands that he lived in the reign of Antoninus Pius, and
the testimony of Eusebius and most credible historians renders it nearly
certain that he suffered martyrdom in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The
*Chronicon Paschale* gives as the date 165 <span class="upper"><span
id="viii.i-p11.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="viii.i-p12"></span>The writings of Justin Martyr are among the
most important that have come down to us from the second century. He was
not the first that wrote an Apology in behalf of the Christians, but his
Apologies are the earliest extant. They are characterized by intense
Christian fervour, and they give us an insight into the relations
existing between heathens and Christians in those days. His other
principal writing, the Dialogue with Trypho, is the first elaborate
exposition of the reasons for regarding Christ as the Messiah of the Old
Testament, and the first systematic attempt to exhibit the false
position of the Jews in regard to Christianity.

<span id="viii.i-p13"></span>Many of Justin’s writings have perished.
Those works which have come to us bearing his name have been divided
into three classes.

<span id="viii.i-p14"></span> <span id="page_161">p. 161</span> <span
id="viii.i-Page_161"></span> The first class embraces those which are
unquestionably genuine, viz. the two Apologies, and the Dialogue with
Trypho. Some critics have urged objections against Justin’s authorship
of the Dialogue; but the objections are regarded now as possessing no
weight.

<span id="viii.i-p15"></span>The second class consists of those works
which are regarded by some critics as Justin’s, and by others as not
his. They are: 1. An Address to the Greeks; 2. A Hortatory Address to
the Greeks; 3. On the Sole Government of God; 4. An Epistle to
Diognetus; 5. Fragments from a work on the Resurrection; 6. And other
Fragments. Whatever difficulty there may be in settling the authorship
of these treatises, there is but one opinion as to their earliness. The
latest of them, in all probability, was not written later than the third
century.

<span id="viii.i-p16"></span>The third class consists of those that are
unquestionably not the works of Justin. These are: 1. An Exposition of
the True Faith; 2. Replies to the Orthodox; 3. Christian Questions to
Gentiles; 4. Gentile Questions to Christians; 5. Epistle to Zenas and
Serenus; and 6. A Refutation of certain Doctrines of Aristotle. There is
no clue to the date of the two last. There can be no doubt that the
others were written after the Council of Nicæa, though, immediately
after the Reformation, Calvin and others appealed to the first as a
genuine writing of Justin’s.

<span id="viii.i-p17"></span>There is a curious question connected with
the Apologies of Justin which have come down to us. Eusebius mentions
two Apologies,—one written in the reign of Antoninus Pius, the other in
the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Critics have disputed much whether we have
these two Apologies in those now extant. Some have maintained, that what
is now called the Second Apology was the preface of the first, and that
the second is lost. Others have tried to show, that the so-called Second
Apology is the continuation of the first, and that the second is lost.
Others have supposed that the two Apologies which we have are Justin’s
two Apologies, but that Eusebius was wrong in affirming that the second
was addressed to Marcus Aurelius; and others maintain, that we have in
our two Apologies the two Apologies mentioned by Eusebius, and that our
first is his first, and our second his second.
