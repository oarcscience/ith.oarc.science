### <span id="viii.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Christians serve God rationally.

<span id="viii.ii.xiii-p1"></span>What sober-minded man, then, will not
acknowledge that we are not atheists, worshipping as we do the Maker of
this universe, and declaring, as we have been taught, that He has no
need of streams of blood and libations and incense; whom we praise to
the utmost of our power by the exercise of prayer and thanksgiving for
all things wherewith we are supplied, as we have been taught that the
only honour that is worthy of Him is not to consume by fire what He has
brought into being for our sustenance, but to use it for ourselves and
those who need, and with gratitude to Him to offer thanks by invocations
and hymns <span id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781.md) for our creation,
and for all the means of health, and for the various qualities of the
different kinds of things, and for the changes of the seasons; and to
present before Him petitions for our existing again in incorruption
through faith in Him. <span id="viii.ii.xiii-p2.5"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xiii-p2.6"></span>Our teacher of these things is Jesus
Christ, who also was born for this purpose, and was crucified under
Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judæa, in the times of Tiberius Cæsar; and
that we reasonably worship Him, having learned that He is the Son of the
true <span id="page_167">p. 167</span> <span
id="viii.ii.xiii-Page_167"></span> God Himself, and holding Him in the
second place, and the prophetic Spirit in the third, we will prove.
<span id="viii.ii.xiii-p2.7"></span>For they proclaim our madness to
consist in this, that we give to a crucified man a place second to the
unchangeable and eternal God, the Creator of all; for they do not
discern the mystery that is herein, to which, as we make it plain to
you, we pray you to give heed.

or some of those psalms and songs made by the primitive Christians,
which are mentioned in Eusebius, *H. E.*, v. 28.” —<span
