### <span id="viii.v.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Closing appeal.

<span id="viii.v.v-p1"></span><span id="viii.v.v-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.v.v-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.v.v-p1.3"></span>Henceforth, ye
Greeks, come and partake of incomparable wisdom, and be instructed by
the Divine Word, and acquaint yourselves with the King immortal; and do
not recognise those men as heroes who slaughter whole nations. For our
own Ruler, <span id="fr_2503"></span>[2504](#fn_2503.md) the Divine Word,
who even now constantly aids us, does not desire strength of body and
beauty of feature, nor yet the high spirit of earth’s nobility, but a
pure soul, fortified by holiness, and the watchwords of our King, holy
actions, for through the Word power passes into the soul. O trumpet of
peace to the soul that is at war! O weapon that puttest to flight
terrible passions! O instruction that quenches the innate fire of the
soul! The Word exercises an influence which does not make poets: it does
not equip philosophers nor skilled orators, but by its instruction it
makes mortals immortal, mortals gods; and from the earth transports them
to the realms above Olympus. Come, be taught; become as I am, for I,
too, was as ye are. <span id="fr_2504"></span>[2505](#fn_2504.md) These
have conquered me—the divinity of the instruction, and the power of the
Word: for as a skilled serpent-charmer lures the terrible reptile from
his den and causes it to flee, so the Word drives the fearful passions
of our sensual nature from the very recesses of the soul; first driving
forth lust, through which every ill is begotten—hatreds, strife, envy,
emulations, anger, and such like. Lust being once banished, the soul
becomes calm and serene. And being set free from the ills in which it
was sunk up to the neck, it returns to Him who made it. For it is fit
that it be restored to that state whence it departed, whence every soul
was or is. <span id="fr_2505"></span>[2506](#fn_2505.md)
