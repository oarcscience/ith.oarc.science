### <span id="v.iv.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Avoid the deadly errors of the Docetæ.

<span id="v.iv.xi-p1"></span><span id="v.iv.xi-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.iv.xi-p1.2"></span><span id="v.iv.xi-p1.3"></span>Flee, therefore,
those evil offshoots \[of Satan\], which produce death-bearing fruit,
whereof if any one tastes, he instantly dies. For these men are not the
planting of the Father. For if they were, they would appear as branches
of the cross, and their fruit would be incorruptible. By it <span
id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805) He calls you through His passion, as
being His members. The head, therefore, cannot be born by itself,
without its members; God, who is \[the Saviour\] Himself, having
promised their union. <span id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806)

<span id="v.iv.xi-p4"></span><span id="v.iv.xi-p4.1"></span><span
id="v.iv.xi-p4.2"></span><span id="v.iv.xi-p4.3"></span>Do ye also avoid
those wicked offshoots of his, <span id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807)
Simon his firstborn son, and Menander, and Basilides, and all his wicked
mob of followers, <span id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808) the
worshippers of a man, whom also the prophet Jeremiah pronounces
accursed. <span id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809) <span
id="v.iv.xi-p7.1"></span>Flee also the impure Nicolaitanes, falsely so
called, <span id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810) who are lovers of
pleasure, and given to calumnious speeches. Avoid also the children of
the evil one, Theodotus and Cleobulus, who produce death-bearing fruit,
whereof if any one tastes, he instantly dies, and that not a mere
temporary death, but one that shall endure for ever. These men are not
the planting of the Father, but are an accursed brood. And says the
Lord, “Let every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted be
rooted up.” <span id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811) For if they had been
branches of the Father, they would not have been “enemies of the cross
of Christ,” <span id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812) but rather of those
who “killed the Lord of glory.” <span id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813)
But now, by denying the cross, and being ashamed of the passion, they
cover the transgression of the Jews, those fighters against God, those
murderers of the Lord; for it were too little to style them merely
murderers of the prophets. But Christ invites you to \[share in\] His
immortality, by His passion and resurrection, inasmuch as ye are His
members.
