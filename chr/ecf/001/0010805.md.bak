### <span id="ix.vi.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—The Old Testament Scriptures, and those written by Moses in particular, do everywhere make mention of the Son of God, and foretell His advent and passion. From this fact it follows that they were inspired by one and the same God.

<span id="ix.vi.xi-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.xi-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.xi-p1.2"></span><span id="ix.vi.xi-p1.3"></span>Wherefore also
John does appropriately relate that the Lord said to the Jews: “Ye
search the Scriptures, in which ye think ye have eternal life; these are
they which testify of me. And ye are not willing to come unto Me, that
ye may have life.” <span id="fr_3915"></span>[3916](#fn_3915.md) How
therefore did the Scriptures testify of Him, unless they were from one
and the same Father, instructing men beforehand as to the advent of His
Son, and foretelling the salvation brought in by Him? “For if ye had
believed Moses, ye would also have believed Me; for he wrote of
Me;” <span id="fr_3916"></span>[3917](#fn_3916.md) \[saying this,\] no
doubt, because the Son of God is implanted everywhere throughout his
writings: at one time, indeed, speaking with Abraham, when about to eat
with him; at another time with Noah, giving to him the dimensions \[of
the ark\]; at another; inquiring after Adam; at another, bringing down
judgment upon the Sodomites; and again, when He becomes visible, <span
id="fr_3917"></span>[3918](#fn_3917.md) and directs Jacob on his journey,
and speaks with Moses from the bush. <span
id="fr_3918"></span>[3919](#fn_3918.md) And it would be endless to recount
\[the occasions\] upon which the Son of God is shown forth by Moses. Of
the day of His passion, too, he was not ignorant; but foretold Him,
after a figurative manner, by the name given to the passover; <span
id="fr_3919"></span>[3920](#fn_3919.md) and at that very festival, which
had been proclaimed such a long time previously by Moses, did our Lord
suffer, thus fulfilling the passover. And he did not describe the day
only, but the place also, and the time of day at which the sufferings
ceased, <span id="fr_3920"></span>[3921](#fn_3920.md) and the sign of the
setting of the sun, saying: “Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover
within any other of thy cities which the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.xi-p7.1"></span>Lord</span> God gives thee; but in the place
which the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.xi-p7.2"></span>Lord</span> thy God shall choose that His name
be called on there, thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, towards
the setting of the sun.” <span id="fr_3921"></span>[3922](#fn_3921.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xi-p9"></span>2. And already he had also declared His
advent, saying, “There shall not fail a chief in Judah, nor a leader
from his loins, until He come for whom it is laid up, and He is the hope
of the nations; binding His foal to the vine, and His ass’s colt to the
creeping ivy. He shall wash His stole in wine, and His upper garment
<span id="page_474">p. 474</span> <span id="ix.vi.xi-Page_474"></span>
in the blood of the grape; His eyes shall be more joyous than
wine, <span id="fr_3922"></span>[3923](#fn_3922.md) and His teeth whiter
than milk.” <span id="fr_3923"></span>[3924](#fn_3923.md) For, let those
who have the reputation of investigating everything, inquire at what
time a prince and leader failed out of Judah, and who is the hope of the
nations, who also is the vine, what was the ass’s colt \[referred to
as\] His, what the clothing, and what the eyes, what the teeth, and what
the wine, and thus let them investigate every one of the points
mentioned; and they shall find that there was none other announced than
our Lord, Christ Jesus. Wherefore Moses, when chiding the ingratitude of
the people, said, “Ye infatuated people, and unwise, do ye thus requite
the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.xi-p11.2"></span>Lord</span>?” <span
id="fr_3924"></span>[3925](#fn_3924.md) And again, he indicates that He who
from the beginning founded and created them, the Word, who also redeems
and vivifies us in the last times, is shown as hanging on the tree, and
they will not believe on Him. For he says, “And thy life shall be
hanging before thine eyes, and thou wilt not believe thy life.” <span
id="fr_3925"></span>[3926](#fn_3925.md) And again, “Has not this same one
thy Father owned thee, and made thee, and created thee?” <span
id="fr_3926"></span>[3927](#fn_3926.md)

favourite notion among the Fathers, derived from Philo the Jew, that the
name *Israel* was compounded from the three Hebrew words <span

<span id="ix.vi.xi-p6"></span> Feuardent infers with great probability
from this passage, that Irenæus, like Tertullian and others of the
Fathers, connected the word *Pascha* with <span class="Greek"><span

constantly giving colour to early Christian ideas in this manner, they
concluded, perhaps, that such coincidences were designed. The LXX. were
credited with a sort of inspiration, as we learn from our author.\]
