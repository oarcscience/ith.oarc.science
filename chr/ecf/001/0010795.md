### <span id="ix.vi.i-p0.1"></span>Preface.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p1"></span>1. <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.i-p1.1"></span>By</span> transmitting to thee, my very dear
friend, this fourth book of the work which is \[entitled\] *The
Detection and Refutation of False Knowledge*, I shall, as I have
promised, add weight, by means of the words of the Lord, to what I have
already advanced; so that thou also, as thou hast requested, mayest
obtain from me the means of confuting all the heretics everywhere, and
not permit them, beaten back at all points, to launch out further into
the deep of error, nor to be drowned in the sea of ignorance; but that
thou, turning them into the haven of the truth, mayest cause them to
attain their salvation.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p2"></span>2. The man, however, who would undertake
their conversion, must possess an accurate knowledge of their systems or
schemes of doctrine. For it is impossible for any one to heal the sick,
if he has no knowledge of the disease of the patients. This was the
reason that my predecessors—much superior men to myself, too —were
unable, notwithstanding, to refute the Valentinians satisfactorily,
because they were ignorant of these men’s system; <span
id="fr_3797"></span>[3798](#fn_3797.md) which I have with all care
delivered to thee in the first book in which I have also shown that
their doctrine is a recapitulation of all the heretics. For which reason
also, in the second, we have had, as in a mirror, a sight of their
entire discomfiture. For they who oppose these men (the Valentinians) by
the right method, do \[thereby\] oppose all who are of an evil mind; and
they who overthrow them, do in fact overthrow every kind of heresy.

<span id="ix.vi.i-p4"></span>3. For their system is blasphemous above
all \[others\], since they represent that the Maker and Framer, who is
one God, as I have shown, was produced from a defect or apostasy. They
utter blasphemy, also, against our Lord, by cutting off and dividing
Jesus from Christ, and Christ from the Saviour, and again the Saviour
from the Word, and the Word from the Only-begotten. And since they
allege that the Creator originated from a defect or apostasy, so have
they also taught that Christ and the Holy Spirit were emitted on account
of this defect, and that the Saviour was a product of those Æons who
were produced from a defect; so that there is nothing but blasphemy to
be found among them. In the preceding book, then, the ideas of the
apostles as to all these points have been set forth, \[to the effect\]
that not only did they, “who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and
ministers of the word” <span id="fr_3798"></span>[3799](#fn_3798.md) of
truth, hold no such opinions, but that they did also preach to us to
shun these doctrines, <span id="fr_3799"></span>[3800](#fn_3799.md)
foreseeing by the Spirit those weak-minded persons who should be led
astray. <span id="fr_3800"></span>[3801](#fn_3800.md)

<span id="ix.vi.i-p8"></span>4. For as the serpent beguiled Eve, by
promising her what he had not himself, <span
id="fr_3801"></span>[3802](#fn_3801.md) so also do these men, by pretending
\[to possess\] superior knowledge, and \[to be acquainted with\]
ineffable mysteries; and, by promising that admittance which they speak
of as taking place within the Pleroma, plunge those that believe them
into death, rendering them apostates from Him who made them. And at that
time, indeed, the apostate angel, having effected the disobedience of
mankind by means of the serpent, imagined that he escaped the notice of
the Lord; wherefore God assigned him the form <span
id="fr_3802"></span>[3803](#fn_3802.md) and name \[of a serpent\]. But now,
since the last times are \[come upon us\], evil is spread abroad among
men, which not only renders them apostates, but by many machinations
does \[the devil\] raise up blasphemers against the <span
id="page_463">p. 463</span> <span id="ix.vi.i-Page_463"></span> Creator,
namely, by means of all the heretics already mentioned. For all these,
although they issue forth from diverse regions, and promulgate different
\[opinions\], do nevertheless concur in the same blasphemous design,
wounding \[men\] unto death, by teaching blasphemy against God our Maker
and Supporter, and derogating from the salvation of man. Now man is a
mixed organization of soul and flesh, who was formed after the likeness
of God, and moulded by His hands, that is, by the Son and Holy Spirit,
to whom also He said, “Let Us make man.” <span
id="fr_3803"></span>[3804](#fn_3803.md) This, then, is the aim of him who
envies our life, to render men disbelievers in their own salvation, and
blasphemous against God the Creator. For whatsoever all the heretics may
have advanced with the utmost solemnity, they come to this at last, that
they blaspheme the Creator, and disallow the salvation of God’s
workmanship, which the flesh truly is; on behalf of which I have proved,
in a variety of ways, that the Son of God accomplished the whole
dispensation \[of mercy\], and have shown that there is none other
called God by the Scriptures except the Father of all, and the Son, and
those who possess the adoption.
