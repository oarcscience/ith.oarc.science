### <span id="viii.iv.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The law abrogated; the New Testament promised and given by God.

<span id="viii.iv.xi-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>“There
will be no other God, O Trypho, nor was there from eternity any other
existing” (I thus addressed him), “but He who made and disposed all this
universe. Nor do we think that there is one God for us, another for you,
but that He alone is God who led your fathers out from Egypt with a
strong hand and a high arm. Nor have we trusted in any other (for there
is no other), but in Him in whom you also have trusted, the God of
Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. <span
id="viii.iv.xi-p1.2"></span>But we do not trust through Moses or through
the law; for then we would do the same as yourselves. But now <span
id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967.md) —(for I have read that there shall
be a final law, and a covenant, the chiefest <span id="page_200">p.
200</span> <span id="viii.iv.xi-Page_200"></span> of all, which it is
now incumbent on all men to observe, as many as are seeking after the
inheritance of God. For the law promulgated on Horeb is now old, and
belongs to yourselves alone; but *this* is for all universally. Now, law
placed against law has abrogated that which is before it, and a covenant
which comes after in like manner has put an end to the previous one; and
an eternal and final law—namely, Christ —has been given to us, and the
covenant is trustworthy, after which there shall be no law, no
commandment, no ordinance. Have you not read this which Isaiah says:
‘Hearken unto Me, hearken unto Me, my people; and, ye kings, give ear
unto Me: for a law shall go forth from Me, and My judgment shall be for
a light to the nations. My righteousness approaches swiftly, and My
salvation shall go forth, and nations shall trust in Mine arm?’ <span
id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968.md) And by Jeremiah, concerning this
same new covenant, He thus speaks: ‘Behold, the days come, saith the
Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with
the house of Judah; not according to the covenant which I made with
their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them
out of the land of Egypt’ <span id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969) .md).
If, therefore, God proclaimed a new covenant which was to be instituted,
and this for a light of the nations, we see and are persuaded that men
approach God, leaving their idols and other unrighteousness, through the
name of Him who was crucified, Jesus Christ, and abide by their
confession even unto death, and maintain piety. Moreover, by the works
and by the attendant miracles, it is possible for all to understand that
He is the new law, and the new covenant, and the expectation of those
who out of every people wait for the good things of God. For the true
spiritual Israel, and descendants of Judah, Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham
(who in uncircumcision was approved of and blessed by God on account of
his faith, and called the father of many nations), are we who have been
led to God through this crucified Christ, as shall be demonstrated while
we proceed.

<span id="viii.iv.xi-p2"></span> Editors suppose that Justin inserts a
long parenthesis here, from “for” to “Egypt.” It is more natural to take
this as an anacoluthon. Justin was going to say, “But now we trust
through Christ,” but feels that such a statement requires preliminary
explanation.
