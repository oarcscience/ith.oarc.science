### <span id="viii.ii.lxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXII.—Its imitation by demons.

id="viii.ii.lxii-p1.3"></span>And the devils, indeed, having heard this
washing published by the prophet, instigated <span id="page_184">p.
184</span> <span id="viii.ii.lxii-Page_184"></span> those who enter
their temples, and are about to approach them with libations and
burnt-offerings, also to sprinkle themselves; and they cause them also
to wash themselves entirely, as they depart \[from the sacrifice\],
before they enter into the shrines in which their images are set. And
the command, too, given by the priests to those who enter and worship in
the temples, that they take off their shoes, the devils, learning what
happened to the above-mentioned prophet Moses, have given in imitation
of these things. For at that juncture, when Moses was ordered to go down
into Egypt and lead out the people of the Israelites who were there, and
while he was tending the flocks of his maternal uncle <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896) in the land of Arabia, our Christ
conversed with him under the appearance of fire from a bush, and said,
“Put off thy shoes, and draw near and hear.” And he, when he had put off
his shoes and drawn near, heard that he was to go down into Egypt and
lead out the people of the Israelites there; and he received mighty
power from Christ, who spoke to him in the appearance of fire, and went
down and led out the people, having done great and marvellous things;
which, if you desire to know, you will learn them accurately from his
writings.

confused in his mind the histories of Moses and Jacob.
