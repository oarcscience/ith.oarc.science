### <span id="viii.v.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Shameless practices of the Greeks.

<span id="viii.v.iv-p1"></span><span id="viii.v.iv-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.v.iv-p1.2"></span>And your public assemblies I have come to
hate. For there are excessive banquetings, and subtle flutes which
provoke to lustful movements, and useless and luxurious anointings, and
crowning with garlands. With such a mass of evils do you banish shame;
and ye fill your minds with them, and are carried away by intemperance,
and indulge as a common practice in wicked and insane fornication. And
this further I would say to you, why are you, being a Greek, indignant
at your son when he imitates Jupiter, and rises against you and defrauds
you of your own wife? Why do you count him your enemy, and yet worship
one that is like him? And why do you blame your wife for living in
unchastity, and yet honour Venus with shrines? If indeed these things
had been related by others, they would have seemed to be mere slanderous
accusations, and not truth. But now your own poets sing these things,
and your histories noisily publish them.
