### <span id="viii.iv.cii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CII.—The prediction of the events which happened to Christ when He was born. Why God permitted it.

<span id="viii.iv.cii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.cii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cii-p1.3"></span>“And what follows —‘My hope from the
breasts of my mother. On Thee have I been cast from the womb; from my
mother’s belly Thou art my God: for there is no helper. Many calves have
compassed me; fat bulls have beset me round. They opened their mouth
upon me, as a ravening and a roaring lion. All my bones are poured out
and dispersed like water. My heart has become likes wax melting in the
midst of my belly. My strength is become dry like a potsherd; and my
tongue has cleaved to my throat’ —foretold what would come to pass; for
the statement, ‘My hope from the <span id="page_250">p. 250</span> <span
id="viii.iv.cii-Page_250"></span> breasts of my mother,’ \[is thus
explained\]. <span id="viii.iv.cii-p1.4"></span>As soon as He was born
in Bethlehem, as I previously remarked, king Herod, having learned from
the Arabian Magi about Him, made a plot to put Him to death and by God’s
command Joseph took Him with Mary and departed into Egypt. For the
Father had decreed that He whom He had begotten should be put to death,
but not before He had grown to manhood, and proclaimed the word which
proceeded from Him. But if any of you say to us, Could not God rather
have put Herod to death? I return answer by anticipation: Could not God
have cut off in the beginning the serpent, so that he exist not, rather
than have said, ‘And I will put enmity between him and the woman, and
between his seed and her seed?’ <span
id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336) Could He not have at once created a
multitude of men? <span id="viii.iv.cii-p2.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cii-p2.3"></span><span id="viii.iv.cii-p2.4"></span>But yet,
since He knew that it would be good, He created both angels and men free
to do that which is righteous, and He appointed periods of time during
which He knew it would be good for them to have the exercise of
free-will; and because He likewise knew it would be good, He made
general and particular judgments; each one’s freedom of will, however,
being guarded. Hence Scripture says the following, at the destruction of
the tower, and division and alteration of tongues: ‘And the Lord said,
Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they
have begun to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them of all
which they have attempted to do.’ <span
id="fr_2337"></span>[2338](#fn_2337) And the statement, ‘My strength is
become dry like a potsherd, and my tongue has cleaved to my throat,’ was
also a prophecy of what would be done by Him according to the Father’s
will. For the power of His strong word, by which He always confuted the
Pharisees and Scribes, and, in short, all your nation’s teachers that
questioned Him, had a cessation like a plentiful and strong spring, the
waters of which have been turned off, when He kept silence, and chose to
return no answer to any one in the presence of Pilate; as has been
declared in the memoirs of His apostles, in order that what is recorded
by Isaiah might have efficacious fruit, where it is written, ‘The Lord
gives me a tongue, that I may know when I ought to speak.’ <span
id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338) Again, when He said, ‘Thou art my
God; be not far from me,’ He taught that all men ought to hope in God
who created all things, and seek salvation and help from Him alone; and
not suppose, as the rest of men do, that salvation can be obtained by
birth, or wealth, or strength, or wisdom. And such have ever been your
practices: at one time you made a calf, and always you have shown
yourselves ungrateful, murderers of the righteous, and proud of your
descent. <span id="viii.iv.cii-p4.2"></span>For if the Son of God
evidently states that He can be saved, \[neither\] <span
id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339) because He is a son, nor because He
is strong or wise, but that without God He cannot be saved, even though
He be sinless, as Isaiah declares in words to the effect that even in
regard to His very language He committed no sin (for He committed no
iniquity or guile with His mouth), how do you or others who expect to be
saved without this hope, suppose that you are not deceiving yourselves?
