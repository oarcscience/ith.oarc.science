### <span id="viii.ii.xlix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLIX.—His rejection by the Jews foretold.

<span id="viii.ii.xlix-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xlix-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.xlix-p1.2"></span>And
again, how it was said by the same Isaiah, that the Gentile nations who
were not looking for Him should worship Him, but the Jews who always
expected Him should not recognise Him when He came. And the words are
spoken as from the person of Christ; and they are these “I was manifest
to them that asked not for Me; I was found of them that sought Me not: I
said, Behold Me, to a nation that called not on My name. I spread out My
hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people, to those who walked in a
way that is not good, but follow after their own sins; a people that
provoketh Me to anger to My face.” <span
id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868.md) For the Jews having the prophecies,
and being always in expectation of the Christ to come, did not recognise
Him; and not only so, but even treated Him shamefully. <span
id="viii.ii.xlix-p2.2"></span>But the Gentiles, who had never heard
anything about Christ, until the apostles set out from Jerusalem and
preached concerning Him, and gave them the prophecies, were filled with
joy and faith, and cast away their idols, and dedicated themselves to
the Unbegotten God through Christ. And that it was foreknown that these
infamous things should be uttered against those who confessed Christ,
and that those who slandered Him, and said that it was well to preserve
the ancient customs, should be miserable, hear what was briefly said by
Isaiah; it is this: “Woe unto them that call sweet bitter, and bitter
sweet.” <span id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869.md)
