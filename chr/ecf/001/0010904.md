<span id="ix.viii.xxix-p1"></span>The <span
id="fr_4844"></span>[4845](#fn_4844.md) Gospel according to Matthew was
written to the Jews. For they laid particular stress upon the fact that
Christ \[should be\] of the seed of David. Matthew also, who had a still
greater desire \[to establish this point\], took particular pains to
afford them convincing proof that Christ is of the seed of David; and
therefore he commences with \[an account of\] His genealogy.
