### <span id="viii.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Christians unjustly condemned for their mere name.

<span id="viii.ii.iv-p1"></span>By the mere application of a name,
nothing is decided, either good or evil, apart from the actions implied
in the name; and indeed, so far at least as one may judge from the name
we are accused of, we are most excellent people. <span
id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771.md) But <span id="page_164">p.
164</span> <span id="viii.ii.iv-Page_164"></span> as we do not think it
just to beg to be acquitted on account of the name, if we be convicted
as evil-doers, so, on the other hand, if we be found to have committed
no offence, either in the matter of thus naming ourselves, or of our
conduct as citizens, it is your part very earnestly to guard against
incurring just punishment, by unjustly punishing those who are not
convicted. For from a name neither praise nor punishment could
reasonably spring, unless something excellent or base in action be
proved. And those among yourselves who are accused you do not punish
before they are convicted; but in our case you receive the name as proof
against us, and this although, so far as the name goes, you ought rather
to punish our accusers. For we are accused of being Christians, and to
hate what is *excellent* (Chrestian) is unjust. Again, if any of the
accused deny the name, and say that he is not a Christian, you acquit
him, as having no evidence against him as a wrong-doer; but if any one
acknowledge that he is a Christian, you punish him on account of this
acknowledgment. Justice requires that you inquire into the life both of
him who confesses and of him who denies, that by his deeds it may be
apparent what kind of man each is. <span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.3"></span>For
as some who have been taught by the Master, Christ, not to deny Him,
give encouragement to others when they are put to the question, so in
all probability do those who lead wicked lives give occasion to those
who, without consideration, take upon them to accuse all the Christians
of impiety and wickedness. And this also is not right. For of
philosophy, too, some assume the name and the garb who do nothing worthy
of their profession; and you are well aware, that those of the ancients
whose opinions and teachings were quite diverse, are yet all called by
the one name of philosophers. <span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.4"></span>And of
these some taught atheism; and the poets who have flourished among you
raise a laugh out of the uncleanness of Jupiter with his own children.
And those who now adopt such instruction are not restrained by you; but,
on the contrary, you bestow prizes and honours upon those who
euphoniously insult the gods.

<span id="viii.ii.iv-p2"></span> Justin avails himself here of the
similarity in sound of the words <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>Χριστὸς</span> (Christ) and <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.2"></span>χρηστὸς</span> (good,
worthy, excellent). The play upon these words is kept up throughout this
paragraph, and cannot be always represented to the English reader. \[But
Justin was merely quoting and using, *ad hominem*, the popular blunder
of which Suetonius (*Life of Claudius*, cap. 25) gives us an example,
“impulsore *Chresto*.” It will be observed again in others of these
Fathers.\]
