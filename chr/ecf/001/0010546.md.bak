### <span id="viii.iv.lxxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXXV.—He proves that Christ is the Lord of Hosts from [Ps. xxiv.](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.iv.lxxxv-p0.2"></span>, and from his authority over demons.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxxv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxxv-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxxv-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxxv-p1.3"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxxv-p1.4"></span>“Moreover, some of you venture to expound
the prophecy which runs, ‘Lift up your gates, ye rulers; and be ye lift
up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of glory may enter,’ <span
id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279.md) as if it referred likewise to
Hezekiah, and others of you \[expound it\] of Solomon; but neither to
the latter nor to the former, nor, in short, to any of your kings, can
it be proved to have reference, but to this our Christ alone, who
appeared without comeliness, and inglorious, as Isaiah and David and all
the Scriptures said; who is the Lord of hosts, by the will of the Father
who conferred on Him \[the dignity\]; who also rose from the dead, and
ascended to heaven, as the Psalm and the other Scriptures manifested
when they announced Him to be Lord of hosts; and of this you may, if you
will, easily be persuaded by the occurrences which take place before
your eyes. For every demon, when exorcised in the name of this very Son
of God —who is the First-born of every creature, who became man by the
Virgin, who suffered, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate by your
nation, who died, who rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven —is
overcome and subdued. But though you exorcise any demon in the name of
any of those who were amongst you—either kings, or righteous men, or
prophets, or patriarchs—it will not be subject to you. But if any of you
exorcise it in \[the name of\] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob, it will perhaps be subject to you. Now assuredly
your exorcists, I have said, <span id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280.md)
make use of craft when they exorcise, even as the Gentiles do, and
employ fumigations and incantations. <span
id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281.md) But that they are angels and powers
whom the word of prophecy by David \[commands\] to lift up the gates,
that He who rose from the dead, Jesus Christ, the Lord of hosts,
according to the will of the Father, might enter, the word of David has
likewise showed; which I shall again recall to your attention for the
sake of those who were not with us yesterday, for whose benefit,
moreover, I sum up many things I said yesterday. And now, if I say this
to you, although I have repeated it many times, I know that it is not
absurd so to do. For it is a ridiculous thing to see the sun, and the
moon, and the other stars, continually keeping the same course, and
bringing round the different seasons; and to see the computer who may be
asked how many are twice two, because he has frequently said that they
are four, not ceasing to say again that they are four; and equally so
other things, which are confidently admitted, to be continually
mentioned and admitted in like manner; yet that he who founds his
discourse on the prophetic Scriptures should leave them and abstain from
constantly referring to the same Scriptures, because it is thought he
can bring forth something better than Scripture. The passage, then, by
which I proved that God reveals that there are both angels and hosts in
heaven is this: ‘Praise <span id="page_242">p. 242</span> <span
id="viii.iv.lxxxv-Page_242"></span> the Lord from the heavens: praise
Him in the highest. Praise Him, all His angels: praise Him, all His
hosts.’ ” <span id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282.md)

<span id="viii.iv.lxxxv-p6"></span>Then one of those who had come with
them on the second day, whose name was Mnaseas, said, “We are greatly
pleased that you undertake to repeat the same things on our account.”

<span id="viii.iv.lxxxv-p7"></span>And I said, “Listen, my friends, to
the Scripture which induces me to act thus. Jesus commanded \[us\] to
love even \[our\] enemies, as was predicted by Isaiah in many passages,
in which also is contained the mystery of our own regeneration, as well,
in fact, as the regeneration of all who expect that Christ will appear
in Jerusalem, and by their works endeavour earnestly to please Him.
These are the words spoken by Isaiah: ‘Hear the word of the Lord, ye
that tremble at His word. Say, our brethren, to them that hate you and
detest you, that the name of the Lord has been glorified. He has
appeared to your joy, and they shall be ashamed. A voice of noise from
the city, a voice from the temple, <span
id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283.md) a voice of the Lord who rendereth
recompense to the proud. Before she that travailed brought forth, and
before the pains of labour came, she brought forth a male child. Who
hath heard such a thing? and who hath seen such a thing? has the earth
brought forth in one day? and has she produced a nation at once? for
Zion has travailed and borne her children. But I have given such an
expectation even to her that does not bring forth, said the Lord.
Behold, I have made her that begetteth, and her that is barren, saith
the Lord. Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and hold a joyous assembly, all ye that
love her. Be glad, all ye that mourn for her, that ye may suck and be
filled with the breast of her consolation, that having suck ye may be
delighted with the entrance of His glory.’ ” <span
