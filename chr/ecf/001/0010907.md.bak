<span id="ix.viii.xxxii-p2"></span><span
id="ix.viii.xxxii-p2.1"></span>Josephus says, that when Moses had been
brought up in the royal palaces, he was chosen as general against the
Ethiopians; and having proved victorious, obtained in marriage the
daughter of that king, since indeed, out of her affection for him, she
delivered the city up to him. <span id="fr_4849"></span>[4850](#fn_4849.md)

<span id="ix.viii.xxxii-p4"></span><span
id="ix.viii.xxxii-p4.1"></span><span id="ix.viii.xxxii-p4.2"></span>Why
was it, that when these two (Aaron and Miriam) had both acted with
despite towards him (Moses), the latter alone was adjudged
punishment? <span id="fr_4850"></span>[4851](#fn_4850.md) First, because
the woman was the more culpable, since both nature and the law place the
woman in a subordinate condition to the man. Or perhaps it was that
Aaron was to a certain degree excusable, in consideration of his being
the elder \[brother\], and adorned with the dignity of high priest. Then
again, inasmuch as the leper was accounted by the law unclean, while at
the same time the origin and foundation of the priesthood lay in Aaron,
\[the Lord\] did not award a similar punishment to him, lest this stigma
should attach itself to the entire \[sacerdotal\] race; but by means of
his sister’s \[example\] He awoke his fears, and taught him the same
lesson. For Miriam’s punishment affected him to such an extent, that no
sooner did she experience it, than he entreated \[Moses\], who had been
injured, that he would by his intercession do away with the affliction.
And he did not neglect to do so, but at once poured forth his
supplication. Upon this the Lord, who loves mankind, made him understand
how He had not chastened her as a judge, but as a father; for He said,
“If her father had spit in her face, should she not be ashamed? Let her
be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her come in
again.” <span id="fr_4851"></span>[4852](#fn_4851.md)

<span id="ix.viii.xxxii-p3"></span> See Josephus’ *Antiquities*, book
ii. chap. x., where we read that this king’s daughter was called
Tharbis. Immediately upon the surrender of this city (Saba, afterwards
called Meroë) Moses married her, and returned to Egypt. Whiston, in the
notes to his translation of Josephus, says, “Nor, perhaps, did St.
Stephen refer to anything else when he said of Moses, before he was sent
by God to the Israelites, that he was not only learned in all the wisdom
of the Egyptians, but was also mighty in words and in deeds” ([Acts vii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#022.md)<span
