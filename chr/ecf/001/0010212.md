### <span id="v.vii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Conclusion.

<span id="v.vii.xiii-p1"></span>I salute the families of my brethren,
with their wives and children, and the virgins who are called
widows. <span id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md) <span
id="v.vii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Be ye strong, I pray, in the power of the
Holy Ghost. Philo, who is with me, greets you. I salute the house of
Tavias, and pray that it may be confirmed in faith and love, both
corporeal and spiritual. I salute Alce, my well-beloved, <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md) and the incomparable Daphnus, and
Eutecnus, and all by name. <span id="v.vii.xiii-p3.1"></span>Fare ye
well in the grace of God.

<span id="v.vii.xiii-p4"></span>I salute the families of my brethren,
with their wives and children, and those that are ever virgins, and the
widows. <span id="v.vii.xiii-p4.1"></span>Be ye strong, I pray, in the
power of the Holy Ghost. Philo, my fellow-servant, who is with me,
greets you. I salute the house of Tavias, and pray that it may be
confirmed in faith and love, both corporeal and spiritual. I salute
Alce; my well-beloved, <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md) and
the incomparable Daphnus, and Eutecnus, and all by name. <span
id="v.vii.xiii-p5.1"></span>Fare ye well in the grace of God, and of our
Lord Jesus Christ, being filled with the Holy Spirit, and divine and
sacred wisdom.
