### <span id="ii.ii.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Let us do those things that please God, and flee from those He hates, that we may be blessed.

<span id="ii.ii.xxx-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxx-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxx-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxx-p1.3"></span>Seeing,
therefore, that we are the portion of the Holy One, let us do all those
things which pertain to holiness, avoiding all evil-speaking, all
abominable and impure embraces, together with all drunkenness, seeking
after change, <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) all abominable
lusts, detestable adultery, and execrable pride. <span
id="ii.ii.xxx-p2.1"></span>“For God,” saith \[the Scripture\],
“resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.” <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) Let us cleave, then, to those to whom
grace has been given by God. Let us clothe ourselves with concord and
humility, ever exercising self-control, standing far off from all
whispering and evil-speaking, being justified by our works, and not our
words. For \[the Scripture\] saith, “He that speaketh much, shall also
hear much in answer. And does he that is ready in speech deem himself
righteous? Blessed is he that is born of woman, who liveth but a short
time: be not given to much speaking.” <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) Let our praise be in God, and not of
ourselves; for God hateth those that commend themselves. Let testimony
to our good deeds be borne by others, as it was in the case of our
righteous forefathers. Boldness, and arrogance, and audacity belong to
those that are accursed of God; but moderation, humility, and meekness
to such as are blessed by Him.
