### <span id="iii.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—The vanity of idols.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p1"></span><span id="iii.ii.ii-p1.1"></span><span
id="iii.ii.ii-p1.2"></span>Come, then, after you have freed <span
id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) yourself from all prejudices
possessing your mind, and laid aside what you have been accustomed to,
as something apt to deceive <span id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) you,
and being made, as if from the beginning, a new man, inasmuch as,
according to your own confession, you are to be the hearer of a new
\[system of\] doctrine; come and contemplate, not with your eyes only,
but with your understanding, the substance and the form <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) of those whom ye declare and deem to
be gods. Is not one of them a stone similar to that on which we tread?
Is <span id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md) not a second brass, in no way
superior to those vessels which are constructed for our ordinary use? Is
not a third wood, and that already rotten? Is not a fourth silver, which
needs a man to watch it, lest it be stolen? Is not a fifth iron,
consumed by rust? Is not a sixth earthenware, in no degree more valuable
than that which is formed for the humblest purposes? Are not all these
of corruptible matter? Are they not fabricated by means of iron and
fire? Did not the sculptor fashion one of them, the brazier a second,
the silversmith a third, and the potter a fourth? Was not every one of
them, before they were formed by the arts of these \[workmen\] into the
shape of these \[gods\], each in its <span
id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) own way subject to change? Would not
those things which are now vessels, formed of the same materials, become
like to such, if they met with the same artificers? Might not these,
which are now worshipped by you, again be made by men vessels similar to
others? Are they not all deaf? Are they not blind? Are they not without
life? Are they not destitute of feeling? Are they not incapable of
motion? Are they not all liable to rot? Are they not all corruptible?
These things ye call gods; these ye serve; these ye worship; and ye
become altogether like to them. For this reason ye hate the Christians,
because they do not deem *these* to be gods. But do not ye yourselves,
who now think and suppose \[such to be gods\], much more cast contempt
upon them than they \[the Christians do\]? Do ye not much more mock and
insult them, when ye worship those that are made of stone and
earthenware, without appointing any persons to guard them; but those
made of silver and gold ye shut up by night, and appoint watchers to
look after them by day, lest they be stolen? And by those gifts which ye
mean to present to them, do ye not, if they are possessed of sense,
rather punish \[than honour\] them? But if, on the other hand, they are
destitute of sense, ye convict them of this fact, while ye worship them
with blood and the smoke of sacrifices. Let any one of you suffer such
indignities! <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) Let any one of you
endure to have such things done to himself! But not a single human being
will, unless compelled to it, <span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span
id="iii.ii.ii-Page_26"></span> endure such treatment, since he is
endowed with sense and reason. A stone, however, readily bears it,
seeing it is insensible. Certainly you do not show \[by your <span
id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) conduct\] that he \[your God\] is
possessed of sense. And as to the fact that Christians are not
accustomed to serve such gods, I might easily find many other things to
say; but if even what has been said does not seem to any one sufficient,
I deem it idle to say anything further.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p2"></span> Or, “purified.”

<span id="fn_267"></span>[25:268](0010069.htm#fr_267.md) <span
id="iii.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p3"></span> Literally, “which is deceiving.”

<span id="fn_268"></span>[25:269](0010069.htm#fr_268.md) <span
id="iii.ii.ii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p4"></span> Literally, “of what substance, or of
what form.”

<span id="fn_269"></span>[25:270](0010069.htm#fr_269.md) <span
id="iii.ii.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p5"></span> Some make this and the following clauses
affirmative instead of interrogative.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[25:271](0010069.htm#fr_270.md) <span
id="iii.ii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p6"></span> The text is here corrupt. Several
attempts at emendation have been made, but without any marked success.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[25:272](0010069.htm#fr_271.md) <span
id="iii.ii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p7"></span> Some read, “Who of you would tolerate
these things?” etc.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[26:273](0010069.htm#fr_272.md) <span
id="iii.ii.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p8"></span> The text is here uncertain, and the
sense obscure. The meaning seems to be, that by sprinkling their gods
with blood, etc., they tended to prove that these were not possessed of
sense.
