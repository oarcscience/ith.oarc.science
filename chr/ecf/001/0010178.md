### <span id="v.v.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Do not save me from martyrdom.

<span id="v.v.ii-p1"></span><span id="v.v.ii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.v.ii-p1.2"></span>For it is not my desire to act towards you as a
man-pleaser, <span id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830.md) but as pleasing
God, even as also ye please Him. For neither shall I ever have such
\[another\] opportunity of attaining to God; nor will ye, if ye shall
now be silent, ever be entitled to <span
id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831.md) the honour of a better work. For if ye
are silent concerning me, I shall become God’s; but if you show your
love to my flesh, I shall again have to run my race. Pray, then, do not
seek to confer any greater favour upon me than that I be sacrificed to
God while the altar is still prepared; that, being gathered together in
love, ye may sing praise to the Father, through Christ Jesus, that God
has deemed me, the bishop of Syria, worthy to be sent for <span
id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832.md) from the east unto the west. It is
good to set from the world unto God, that I may rise again to Him.

<span id="v.v.ii-p5"></span><span id="v.v.ii-p5.1"></span>For it is not
my desire that ye should please men, but God, even as also ye do please
Him. For neither shall I ever hereafter have such an opportunity of
attaining to God; nor will ye, if ye shall now be silent, ever be
entitled to <span id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833.md) the honour of a
better work. For if ye are silent concerning me, I shall become God’s;
but if ye show your love to my flesh, I shall again have to run my race.
Pray, then, do not seek to confer any greater favour upon me than that I
be sacrificed to God, while the altar is still prepared; that, being
gathered together in love, ye may sing praise to the Father, through
Christ Jesus, that God has deemed me, the bishop of Syria, worthy to be
sent for <span id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md) from the east unto the
west, and to become a martyr <span id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md) in
behalf of His own precious <span id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md)
sufferings, so as to pass from the world to God, that I may rise again
unto Him.
