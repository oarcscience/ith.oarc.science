### <span id="ix.iv.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII—Refutation of the opinion, that Paul was the only apostle who had knowledge of the truth.

<span id="ix.iv.xiv-p1"></span>1. With regard to those (the Marcionites)
who allege that Paul alone knew the truth, and that to him the mystery
was manifested by revelation, let Paul himself convict them, when he
says, that one and the same God wrought in Peter for the apostolate of
the circumcision, and in himself for the Gentiles. <span
id="fr_3526"></span>[3527](#fn_3526.md) Peter, therefore, was an apostle of
that very God whose was also Paul; and Him whom Peter preached as God
among those of the circumcision, and likewise the Son of God, did Paul
\[declare\] also among the Gentiles. For our Lord never came to save
Paul alone, nor is God so limited in means, that He should have but one
apostle who knew the dispensation of His Son. And again, when Paul says,
“How beautiful are the feet of those bringing glad tidings of good
things, and preaching the Gospel of peace,” <span
id="fr_3527"></span>[3528](#fn_3527.md) he shows clearly that it was not
merely one, but there were many who used to preach the truth. And again,
in the Epistle to the Corinthians, when he had recounted all those who
had seen God <span id="fr_3528"></span>[3529](#fn_3528.md) after the
resurrection, he <span id="page_437">p. 437</span> <span
id="ix.iv.xiv-Page_437"></span> says in continuation, “But whether it
were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed,” <span
id="fr_3529"></span>[3530](#fn_3529.md) acknowledging as one and the same,
the preaching of all those who saw God <span
id="fr_3530"></span>[3531](#fn_3530.md) after the resurrection from the
dead.

<span id="ix.iv.xiv-p7"></span>2. And again, the Lord replied to Philip,
who wished to behold the Father, “Have I been so long a time with you,
and yet thou hast not known Me, Philip? He that sees Me, sees also the
Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? For I am in the
Father, and the Father in Me; and henceforth ye know Him, and have seen
Him.” <span id="fr_3531"></span>[3532](#fn_3531.md) To these men,
therefore, did the Lord bear witness, that in Himself they had both
known and seen the Father (and the Father is truth). To allege, then,
that these men did not know the truth, is to act the part of false
witnesses, and of those who have been alienated from the doctrine of
Christ. For why did the Lord send the twelve apostles to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel, <span id="fr_3532"></span>[3533](#fn_3532.md) if
these men did not know the truth? How also did the seventy preach,
unless they had themselves previously known the truth of what was
preached? Or how could Peter have been in ignorance, to whom the Lord
gave testimony, that flesh and blood had not revealed to him, but the
Father, who is in heaven? <span id="fr_3533"></span>[3534](#fn_3533.md)
Just, then, as “Paul \[was\] an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but
by Jesus Christ, and God the Father,” <span
id="fr_3534"></span>[3535](#fn_3534.md) \[so with the rest;\] <span
id="fr_3535"></span>[3536](#fn_3535.md) the Son indeed leading them to the
Father, but the Father revealing to them the Son.

<span id="ix.iv.xiv-p13"></span>3. But that Paul acceded to \[the
request of\] those who summoned him to the apostles, on account of the
question \[which had been raised\], and went up to them, with Barnabas,
to Jerusalem, not without reason, but that the liberty of the Gentiles
might be confirmed by them, he does himself say, in the Epistle to the
Galatians: “Then, fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem
with Barnabas, taking also Titus. But I went up by revelation, and
communicated to them that Gospel which I preached among the
Gentiles.” <span id="fr_3536"></span>[3537](#fn_3536.md) And again he says,
“For an hour we did give place to subjection, <span
id="fr_3537"></span>[3538](#fn_3537.md) that the truth of the gospel might
continue with you.” If, then, any one shall, from the Acts of the
Apostles, carefully scrutinize the time concerning which it is written
that he went up to Jerusalem on account of the forementioned question,
he will find those years mentioned by Paul coinciding with it. Thus the
statement of Paul harmonizes with, and is, as it were, identical with,
the testimony of Luke regarding the apostles.

meaning from that which it has in the received text. Jerome says that
there was as much variation in the copies of Scripture in his day with
regard to the passage,—some retaining, others rejecting the negative
(*Adv. Marc.* v. 3).
