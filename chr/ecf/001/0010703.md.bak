### <span id="ix.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The threefold kind of man feigned by these heretics: good works needless for them, though necessary to others: their abandoned morals.

<span id="ix.ii.vii-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.ii.vii-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.ii.vii-p1.2"></span>There being thus three kinds of substances,
they declare of all that is material (which they also describe as being
“on the left hand”) that it must of necessity perish, inasmuch as it is
incapable of receiving any *afflatus* of incorruption. As to every
animal existence (which they also denominate “on the right hand”), they
hold that, inasmuch as it is a mean between the spiritual and the
material, it passes to the side to <span id="page_324">p. 324</span>
<span id="ix.ii.vii-Page_324"></span> which inclination draws it.
Spiritual substance, again, they describe as having been sent forth for
this end, that, being here united with that which is animal, it might
assume shape, the two elements being simultaneously subjected to the
same discipline. And this they declare to be “the salt” <span
id="fr_2733"></span>[2734](#fn_2733.md) and “the light of the world.” For
the animal substance had need of training by means of the outward
senses; and on this account they affirm that the world was created, as
well as that the Saviour came to the animal substance (which was
possessed of free-will), that He might secure for it salvation. For they
affirm that He received the first-fruits of those whom He was to save
\[as follows\], from Achamoth that which was spiritual, while He was
invested by the Demiurge with the animal Christ, but was begirt <span
id="fr_2734"></span>[2735](#fn_2734.md) by a \[special\] dispensation with
a body endowed with an animal nature, yet constructed with unspeakable
skill, so that it might be visible and tangible, and capable of enduring
suffering. At the same time, they deny that He assumed anything material
\[into His nature\], since indeed matter is incapable of salvation. They
further hold that the consummation of all things will take place when
all that is spiritual has been formed and perfected by Gnosis
(knowledge); and by this they mean spiritual men who have attained to
the perfect knowledge of God, and been initiated into these mysteries by
Achamoth. And they represent themselves to be these persons.

<span id="ix.ii.vii-p4"></span>2. Animal men, again, are instructed in
animal things; such men, namely, as are established by their works, and
by a mere faith, while they have not perfect knowledge. We of the
Church, they say, are these persons. <span
id="fr_2735"></span>[2736](#fn_2735.md) Wherefore also they maintain that
good works are necessary to us, for that otherwise it is impossible we
should be saved. <span id="ix.ii.vii-p5.2"></span>But as to themselves,
they hold that they shall be entirely and undoubtedly saved, not by
means of conduct, but because they are spiritual by nature. <span
id="fr_2736"></span>[2737](#fn_2736.md) For, just as it is impossible that
material substance should partake of salvation (since, indeed, they
maintain that it is incapable of receiving it), so again it is
impossible that spiritual substance (by which they mean themselves)
should ever come under the power of corruption, whatever the sort of
actions in which they indulged. For even as gold, when submersed in
filth, loses not on that account its beauty, but retains its own native
qualities, the filth having no power to injure the gold, so they affirm
that they cannot in any measure suffer hurt, or lose their spiritual
substance, whatever the material actions in which they may be involved.

<span id="ix.ii.vii-p7"></span>3. <span id="ix.ii.vii-p7.1"></span><span
id="ix.ii.vii-p7.2"></span><span id="ix.ii.vii-p7.3"></span>Wherefore
also it comes to pass, that the “most perfect” among them addict
themselves without fear to all those kinds of forbidden deeds of which
the Scriptures assure us that “they who do such things shall not inherit
the kingdom of God.” <span id="fr_2737"></span>[2738](#fn_2737.md) For
instance, they make no scruple about eating meats offered in sacrifice
to idols, imagining that they can in this way contract no defilement.
Then, again, at every heathen festival celebrated in honour of the
idols, these men are the first to assemble; and to such a pitch do they
go, that some of them do not even keep away from that bloody spectacle
hateful both to God and men, in which gladiators either fight with wild
beasts, or singly encounter one another. Others of them yield themselves
up to the lusts of the flesh with the utmost greediness, maintaining
that carnal things should be allowed to the carnal nature, while
spiritual things are provided for the spiritual. Some of them, moreover,
are in the habit of defiling those women to whom they have taught the
above doctrine, as has frequently been confessed by those women who have
been led astray by certain of them, on their returning to the Church of
God, and acknowledging this along with the rest of their errors. Others
of them, too, openly and without a blush, having become passionately
attached to certain women, seduce them away from their husbands, and
contract marriages of their own with them. Others of them, again, who
pretend at first to live in all modesty with them as with sisters, have
in course of time been revealed in their true colours, when the sister
has been found with child by her \[pretended\] brother.

<span id="ix.ii.vii-p9"></span>4. And committing many other abominations
and impieties, they run us down (who from the fear of God guard against
sinning even in thought or word) as utterly contemptible and ignorant
persons, while they highly exalt themselves, and claim to be perfect,
and the elect seed. For they declare that we simply receive grace for
use, wherefore also it will again be taken away from us; but that they
themselves have grace as their own special possession, which has
descended from above by means of an unspeakable and indescribable
conjunction; and on this account more will be given them. <span
id="fr_2738"></span>[2739](#fn_2738.md) They maintain, therefore, that in
every way it is always necessary for them to practise the mystery of
conjunction. And that they may persuade the thoughtless to believe this,
they are in the habit of using these very words, “Whosoever being *in*
this world does not so love a woman as to <span id="page_325">p.
325</span> <span id="ix.ii.vii-Page_325"></span> obtain possession of
her, is not of the truth, nor shall attain to the truth. But whosoever
being *of* <span id="fr_2739"></span>[2740](#fn_2739.md) this world has
intercourse with woman, shall not attain to the truth, because he has so
acted under the power of concupiscence.” <span
id="ix.ii.vii-p11.2"></span>On this account, they tell us that it is
necessary for us whom they call *animal* men, and describe as being *of*
the world, to practise continence and good works, that by this means we
may attain at length to the intermediate habitation, but that to them
who are called “the spiritual and perfect” such a course of conduct is
not at all necessary. For it is not conduct of any kind which leads into
the Pleroma, but the seed sent forth thence in a feeble, immature state,
and here brought to perfection.
