id="ix.viii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Observe <span
id="fr_4847"></span>[4848](#fn_4847.md) that, by means of the grain of
mustard seed in the parable, the heavenly doctrine is denoted which is
sown like seed in the world, as in a field, \[seed\] which has an
inherent force, fiery and powerful. For the Judge of the whole world is
thus proclaimed, who, having been hidden in the heart of the earth in a
tomb for three days, and having become a great tree, has stretched forth
His branches to the ends of the earth. Sprouting out from Him, the
twelve apostles, having become fair and fruitful boughs, were made a
shelter for the nations as for the fowls of heaven, under which boughs,
all having taken refuge, as birds flocking to a nest, have been made
partakers of that wholesome and celestial food which is derived from
them.
