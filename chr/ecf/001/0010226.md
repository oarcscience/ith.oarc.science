### <span id="v.x.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="v.x.iii-p1"></span>Let not those who seem to be somewhat, and
teach strange doctrines, strike thee with apprehension; but stand thou
in the truth, as an athlete <span id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136.md)
who is smitten, for it is \[the part\] of a great athlete to be smitten,
and \[yet\] conquer. More especially is it fitting that we should bear
everything for the sake of God, that He also may bear us. Be \[still\]
more diligent than thou yet art. Be discerning of the times. Look for
Him that is above the times, Him who has no times, Him who is invisible,
Him who for our sakes became visible, Him who is impalpable, Him who is
impassible, Him who for our sakes suffered, Him who endured everything
in every form for our sakes.
