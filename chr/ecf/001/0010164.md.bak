### <span id="v.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Be subject to the bishop, etc.

<span id="v.iv.ii-p1"></span><span id="v.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>For, since
ye are subject to the bishop as to Jesus Christ, ye appear to me to live
not after the manner of men, but according to Jesus Christ, who died for
us, in order, by believing in His death, ye may escape from death. <span
id="v.iv.ii-p1.2"></span><span id="v.iv.ii-p1.3"></span>It is therefore
necessary that, as ye indeed do, so without the bishop ye should do
nothing, but should also <span id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span
id="v.iv.ii-Page_67"></span> be subject to the presbytery, as to the
apostle of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in whom, if we live, we shall
\[at last\] be found. It is fitting also that the deacons, as being
\[the ministers\] of the mysteries of Jesus Christ, should in every
respect be pleasing to all. <span id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md) For
they are not ministers of meat and drink, but servants of the Church of
God. <span id="v.iv.ii-p2.1"></span>They are bound, therefore, to avoid
all grounds of accusation \[against them\], as they would do fire.

<span id="v.iv.ii-p3"></span>Be ye subject to the bishop as to the Lord,
for “he watches for your souls, as one that shall give account to
God.” <span id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md) <span
id="v.iv.ii-p4.2"></span>Wherefore also, ye appear to me to live not
after the manner of men, but according to Jesus Christ, who died for us,
in order that, by believing in His death, ye may by baptism be made
partakers of His resurrection. It is therefore necessary, whatsoever
things ye do, to do nothing without the bishop. <span
id="v.iv.ii-p4.3"></span><span id="v.iv.ii-p4.4"></span>And be ye
subject also to the presbytery, as to the apostles of Jesus Christ, who
is our hope, in whom, if we live, we shall be found in Him. It behoves
you also, in every way, to please the deacons, who are \[ministers\] of
the mysteries of Christ Jesus; for they are not ministers of meat and
drink, but servants of the Church of God. <span
id="v.iv.ii-p4.5"></span>They are bound, therefore, to avoid all grounds
of accusation \[against them\], as they would a burning fire. Let them,
then, prove themselves to be such.

<span id="v.iv.ii-p2"></span> It is doubtful whether this exhortation is
addressed to the deacons or people; whether the former are urged in all
respects to please the latter, or the latter in all points to be pleased
with the former.
