### <span id="viii.iv.xxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—[Ps. cx.](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.iv.xxxiii-p0.2"></span> is not spoken of Hezekiah. He proves that Christ was first humble, then shall be glorious.

id="viii.iv.xxxiii-p1.3"></span>“And,” I continued, “I am not ignorant
that you venture to expound this psalm as if it referred to king
Hezekiah; but that you are mistaken, I shall prove to you from these
very words forthwith. ‘The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent,’ it is
said; and, ‘Thou art a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek,’
with what follows and precedes. Not even you will venture to object that
Hezekiah was either a priest, or is the everlasting priest of God; but
that this is spoken of our Jesus, these expressions show. But your ears
are shut up, and your hearts are made dull. <span
id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031.md) For by this statement, ‘The Lord
hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever, after the
order of Melchizedek,’ with an oath God has shown Him (on account of
your unbelief) to be the High Priest after the order of Melchizedek;
i.e., as Melchizedek was described by Moses as the priest of the Most
High, and he was a priest of those who were in uncircumcision, and
blessed the circumcised Abraham who brought him tithes, so God has shown
that His everlasting Priest, called also by the Holy Spirit Lord, would
be Priest of those in uncircumcision. Those too in circumcision who
approach Him, that is, believing Him and seeking blessings from Him, He
will both receive and bless. And that He shall be first humble as a man,
and then exalted, these words at the end of the Psalm show: ‘He shall
drink of the brook in the way,’ and then, ‘Therefore shall He lift up
the head.’
