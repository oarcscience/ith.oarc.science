### <span id="ii.ii.xliii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLIII.—Moses of old stilled the contention which arose concerning the priestly dignity.

<span id="ii.ii.xliii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xliii-p1.1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xliii-p1.2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xliii-p1.3"></span>And what wonder is it if those in Christ
who were entrusted with such a duty by God, appointed those
\[ministers\] before mentioned, when the blessed Moses also, “a faithful
servant in all his house,” <span id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) noted
down in the sacred books all the injunctions which were given him, and
when the other prophets also followed him, bearing witness with one
consent to the ordinances which he had appointed? <span
id="ii.ii.xliii-p2.3"></span>For, when rivalry arose concerning the
priesthood, and the tribes were contending among themselves as to which
of them should be adorned with that glorious title, he commanded the
twelve princes of the tribes to bring him their rods, each one being
inscribed with the name <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) of the
tribe. And he took them and bound them \[together\], and sealed them
with the rings of the princes of the tribes, and laid them up in the
tabernacle of witness on the table of God. And having shut the doors of
the tabernacle, he sealed the keys, as he had done the rods, and said to
them, Men and brethren, the tribe whose rod shall blossom has God chosen
to fulfil the office of the priesthood, and to minister unto Him. And
when the morning was come, he assembled all Israel, six hundred thousand
men, and showed the seals to the princes of the tribes, and opened the
tabernacle of witness, and brought forth the rods. And the rod of Aaron
was found not only to have blossomed, but to bear fruit upon it. <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) What think ye, beloved? Did not Moses
know beforehand that this would happen? Undoubtedly he knew; but he
acted thus, that there might be no sedition in Israel, and that <span
id="page_17">p. 17</span> <span id="ii.ii.xliii-Page_17"></span> the
name of the true and only God might be glorified; to whom be glory for
ever and ever. Amen.
