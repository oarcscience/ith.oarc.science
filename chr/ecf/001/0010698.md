### <span id="ix.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Absurd ideas of the disciples of Valentinus as to the origin, name, order, and conjugal productions of their fancied Æons, with the passages of Scripture which they adapt to their opinions.

<span id="ix.ii.ii-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.ii.ii-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.ii.ii-p1.2"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="ix.ii.ii-p1.3"></span>They</span> maintain, then, that in the
invisible and ineffable heights above there exists a certain perfect,
pre-existent Æon, <span id="fr_2663"></span>[2664](#fn_2663) whom they
call Proarche, <span id="ix.ii.ii-p2.5"></span>Propator, and <span
id="ix.ii.ii-p2.6"></span>Bythus, and describe as being invisible and
incomprehensible. Eternal and unbegotten, he remained throughout
innumerable cycles of ages in profound serenity and quiescence. <span
id="ix.ii.ii-p2.7"></span>There existed along with him Ennœa, whom they
also call Charis and Sige. <span id="fr_2664"></span>[2665](#fn_2664) At
last this Bythus determined to send forth from himself the beginning of
all things, and deposited this production (which he had resolved to
bring forth) in his contemporary <span id="ix.ii.ii-p3.2"></span>Sige,
even as seed is deposited in the womb. She then, having received this
seed, and becoming pregnant, gave birth to Nous, who was both similar
and equal to him who had produced him, and was alone capable of
comprehending his father’s greatness. This Nous they call also
Monogenes, and Father, and the Beginning of all Things. <span
id="ix.ii.ii-p3.3"></span>Along with him was also produced Aletheia; and
these four constituted the first and first-begotten Pythagorean Tetrad,
which they also denominate the root of all things. <span
id="ix.ii.ii-p3.4"></span>For there are first Bythus and Sige, and then
Nous and Aletheia. And Monogenes, perceiving for what purpose he had
been produced, also himself sent forth Logos and <span
id="ix.ii.ii-p3.5"></span>Zoe, being the father of all those who were to
come after him, and the beginning and fashioning of the entire Pleroma.
By the conjunction of Logos and Zoe were brought forth <span
id="ix.ii.ii-p3.6"></span>Anthropos and Ecclesia; <span
id="ix.ii.ii-p3.7"></span>and thus was formed the first-begotten Ogdoad,
the root and substance of all things, called among them by four names,
viz., Bythus, and Nous, and Logos, and Anthropos. For each of these is
masculo-feminine, as follows: Propator was united by a conjunction with
his Ennœa; then Monogenes, that is Nous, with Aletheia; Logos with Zoe,
and Anthropos with Ecclesia.

<span id="ix.ii.ii-p4"></span>2. <span id="ix.ii.ii-p4.1"></span>These
Æons having been produced for the glory of the Father, and wishing, by
their own efforts, to effect this object, sent forth emanations by means
of conjunction. Logos and Zoe, after producing Anthropos and Ecclesia,
sent forth other ten Æons, whose names are the following: Bythius and
Mixis, Ageratos and Henosis, Autophyes and Hedone, Acinetos and
Syncrasis, Monogenes and Macaria. <span
id="fr_2665"></span>[2666](#fn_2665) These are <span id="page_317">p.
317</span> <span id="ix.ii.ii-Page_317"></span> the ten Æons whom they
declare to have been produced by Logos and Zoe. They then add that
Anthropos himself, along with Ecclesia, produced twelve Æons, to whom
they give the following names: Paracletus and Pistis, Patricos and
Elpis, Metricos and Agape, Ainos and Synesis, Ecclesiasticus and
Macariotes, Theletos and <span id="ix.ii.ii-p5.2"></span>Sophia.

<span id="ix.ii.ii-p6"></span>3. Such are the thirty Æons in the
erroneous system of these men; and they are described as being wrapped
up, so to speak, in silence, and known to none \[except these professing
teachers\]. Moreover, they declare that this invisible and spiritual
Pleroma of theirs is tripartite, being divided into an Ogdoad, a Decad,
and a Duodecad. And for this reason they affirm it was that the
“Saviour”— for they do not please to call Him “Lord”—did no work in
public during the space of thirty years, <span
id="fr_2666"></span>[2667](#fn_2666) thus setting forth the mystery of
these Æons. They maintain also, that these thirty Æons are most plainly
indicated in the parable <span id="fr_2667"></span>[2668](#fn_2667) of
the labourers sent into the vineyard. For some are sent about the first
hour, others about the third hour, others about the sixth hour, others
about the ninth hour, and others about the eleventh hour. Now, if we add
up the numbers of the hours here mentioned, the sum total will be
thirty: for one, three, six, nine, and eleven, when added together, form
thirty. And by the hours, they hold that the Æons were pointed out;
while they maintain that these are great, and wonderful, and hitherto
unspeakable mysteries which it is their special function to develop; and
so they proceed when they find anything in the multitude <span
id="fr_2668"></span>[2669](#fn_2668) of things contained in the
Scriptures which they can adopt and accommodate to their baseless
speculations.

id="ix.ii.ii-p1.4"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii-p2"></span> <span id="ix.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>This term
Æon (<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.ii.ii-p2.2"></span>Αἰών</span>)
seems to have been formed from the words <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.ii.ii-p2.3"></span>ἀεὶ ὤν</span>, *ever-existing*. “We may take
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.ii.ii-p2.4"></span>αἰών</span>,
therefore,” says Harvey (*Irenæus*, cxix.), “in the Valentinian
acceptation of the word, to mean an emanation from the divine substance,
subsisting co-ordinately and co-eternally with the Deity, the Pleroma
still remaining one.”

<span id="fn_2664"></span>[316:2665](0010698.htm#fr_2664) <span
id="ix.ii.ii-p2.8"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii-p3"></span> <span id="ix.ii.ii-p3.1"></span>Sige,
however, was no true consort of Bythus, who included in himself the idea
of male and female, and was the one cause of all things: comp.
Hippolytus, *Philosop.*, vi. 29. There seems to have been considerable
disagreement among these heretics as to the completion of the mystical
number thirty. Valentinus himself appears to have considered Bythus as a
monad, and Sige as a mere nonentity. The two latest Æons, Christ and the
Holy Spirit, would then complete the number thirty. But other Gnostic
teachers included both Bythus and Sige in that mystical number.

<span id="ix.ii.ii-p5"></span> <span id="ix.ii.ii-p5.1"></span>It may be
well to give here the English equivalents of the names of these Æons and
their authors. They are as follows: Bythus, *Profundity*; Proarche,
*First-Beginning*; Propator, *First-Father*; Ennœa, *Idea*; Charis,
*Grace*; Sige, *Silence*; Nous, *Intelligence*; Aletheia, *Truth*;
Logos, *Word*; Zoe, *Life*; Anthropos, *Man*; Ecclesia, *Church*;
Bythius, *Deep*; Mixis, *Mingling*; Ageratos, *Undecaying*; Henosis,
*Union*; Autophyes, *Self-existent*; Hedone, *Pleasure*; Acinetos,
*Immoveable*; Syncrasis, *Blending*; Monogenes, *Only-Begotten*;
Macaria, *Happiness*; Paracletus, *Advocate*; Pistis, *Faith*; Patricos,
*Ancestral*; Elpis, *Hope*; Metricos, *Metrical*; Agape, *Love*; Ainos,
*Praise*; Synesis, *Understanding*; Ecclesiasticus, *Ecclesiastical*;
Macariotes, *Felicity*; Theletos, *Desiderated*; Sophia, *Wisdom*.

words “a definite number,” thus: “And if there is anything else in
Scripture which is referred to by a definite number.”
