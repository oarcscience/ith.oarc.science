### <span id="v.v.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Pray for the church in Syria.

<span id="v.v.ix-p1"></span>Remember in your prayers the Church in
Syria, which now has God for its shepherd, instead of me. Jesus Christ
alone will oversee it, and your love \[will also regard it\]. But as for
me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for indeed I am not worthy,
as being the very last of them, and one born out of due time. <span
id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873.md) But I have obtained mercy to be
somebody, if I shall attain to God. <span id="v.v.ix-p2.2"></span>My
spirit salutes you, and the love of the Churches that have received me
in the name of Jesus Christ, and not as a mere passer-by. For even those
Churches which were not <span id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874.md) near to
me in the way, I mean according to the flesh, <span
id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875.md) have gone before me, <span
id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876.md) city by city, \[to meet me.\]

<span id="v.v.ix-p6"></span>Remember in your prayers the Church which is
in Syria, which, instead of me, has now for its shepherd the Lord, who
says, “I am the good Shepherd.” And He alone will oversee it, as well as
your love towards Him. But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of
them; for I am not worthy, as being the very last of them, and one born
out of due time. But I have obtained mercy to be somebody, if I shall
attain to God. <span id="v.v.ix-p6.1"></span>My spirit salutes you, and
the love of the Churches which have received me in the name of Jesus
Christ, and not as a mere passer-by. For even those Churches which were
not near to me in the way, have brought me forward, city by city.
