<span id="ix.viii.xxxiii-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Inasmuch <span
id="fr_4852"></span>[4853](#fn_4852) as certain men, impelled by what
considerations I know not, remove from God the half of His creative
power, by asserting that He is merely the cause of quality resident in
matter, and by maintaining that matter itself is uncreated, come now let
us put the question, What is at any time … is immutable. Matter, then,
is immutable. But if matter be immutable, and the immutable suffers no
change in regard to quality, it does not form the substance of the
world. For which reason it seems to them superfluous, that God has
annexed qualities to matter, since indeed matter admits of no possible
alteration, it being in itself an uncreated thing. But further, if
matter be uncreated, it has been made altogether according to a certain
<span id="page_574">p. 574</span> <span
id="ix.viii.xxxiii-Page_574"></span> quality, and this immutable, so
that it cannot be receptive of more qualities, nor can it be the thing
of which the world is made. But if the world be not made from it, \[this
theory\] entirely excludes God from exercising power on the creation
\[of the world\].
