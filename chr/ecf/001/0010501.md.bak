### <span id="viii.iv.xl-p0.1"></span>Chapter XL.—He returns to the Mosaic laws, and proves that they were figures of the things which pertain to Christ.

<span id="viii.iv.xl-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xl-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xl-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.iv.xl-p1.3"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xl-p1.4"></span><span id="viii.iv.xl-p1.5"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xl-p1.6"></span>“The mystery, then, of the lamb which God
enjoined to be sacrificed as the passover, was a type of Christ; with
whose blood, in proportion to their faith in Him, they anoint their
houses, i.e., themselves, who believe on Him. For that the creation
which God created—to wit, Adam—was a house for the spirit which
proceeded from God, you all can understand. And that <span
id="page_215">p. 215</span> <span id="viii.iv.xl-Page_215"></span> this
injunction was temporary, I prove thus. God does not permit the lamb of
the passover to be sacrificed in any other place than where His name was
named; knowing that the days will come, after the suffering of Christ,
when even the place in Jerusalem shall be given over to your enemies,
and all the offerings, in short, shall cease; and that lamb which was
commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the
cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb, <span
id="fr_2054"></span>[2055](#fn_2054.md) which is roasted, is roasted and
dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is transfixed right
through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to
which are attached the legs of the lamb. And the two goats which were
ordered to be offered during the fast, of which one was sent away as the
scape \[goat\], and the other sacrificed, were similarly declarative of
the two appearances of Christ: the first, in which the elders of your
people, and the priests, having laid hands on Him and put Him to death,
sent Him away as the scape \[goat\]; and His second appearance, because
in the same place in Jerusalem you shall recognise Him whom you have
dishonoured, and who was an offering for all sinners willing to repent,
and keeping the fast which Isaiah speaks of, loosening the terms <span
id="fr_2055"></span>[2056](#fn_2055.md) of the violent contracts, and
keeping the other precepts, likewise enumerated by him, and which I have
quoted, <span id="fr_2056"></span>[2057](#fn_2056.md) which those believing
in Jesus do. And further, you are aware that the offering of the two
goats, which were enjoined to be sacrificed at the fast, was not
permitted to take place similarly anywhere else, but only in Jerusalem.
