### <span id="viii.iv.lxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXIII.—\[The words\] “From the wood” have been cut out of [Ps. xcvi.](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#000)<span id="viii.iv.lxxiii-p0.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.lxxiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxiii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxiii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxiii-p1.3"></span>“And from the ninety-fifth
(ninety-sixth) Psalm they have taken away this short saying of the words
of David: ‘From the wood.’ <span id="fr_2221"></span>[2222](#fn_2221)
For when the passage said, ‘Tell ye among the nations, the Lord hath
reigned from the wood,’ they have left, ‘Tell ye among the nations, the
Lord hath reigned.’ Now no one of your people has ever been said to have
reigned as God and Lord among the nations, with the exception of Him
only who was crucified, of whom also the Holy Spirit affirms in the same
Psalm that He was raised again, and freed from \[the grave\], declaring
that there is none like Him among the gods of the nations: for they are
idols of demons. But I shall repeat the whole Psalm to you, that you may
perceive what has been said. It is thus: ‘Sing unto the Lord a new song;
sing unto the Lord, all the earth. Sing unto the Lord, and bless His
name; show forth His salvation from day to day. Declare His glory among
the nations, His wonders among all people. For the Lord is great, and
greatly to be praised: He is to be feared above all the gods. For all
the gods of the nations are demons but the Lord made the heavens.
Confession and beauty are in His presence; holiness and magnificence are
in His sanctuary. Bring to the Lord, O ye countries of the nations,
bring to the Lord glory and honour, bring to the Lord glory in His name.
Take sacrifices, and go into His courts; worship the Lord in His holy
temple. Let the whole earth be moved before Him: tell ye among the
nations, the Lord hath reigned. <span
id="fr_2222"></span>[2223](#fn_2222) For He hath established the world,
which shall not be moved; He shall judge the nations with equity. Let
the heavens rejoice, and the earth be glad; let the sea and its fulness
shake. Let the fields and all therein be joyful. Let all the trees of
the wood be glad before the Lord: for He comes, for He comes to judge
the earth. He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people
with His truth.’ ”

<span id="viii.iv.lxxiii-p4"></span>Here Trypho remarked, <span
id="viii.iv.lxxiii-p4.1"></span>“Whether \[or not\] the rulers of the
people have erased any portion of the Scriptures, as you affirm, God
knows; but it seems incredible.”

<span id="viii.iv.lxxiii-p5"></span>“Assuredly,” said I, “it does seem
incredible. For it is more horrible than the calf which they made, when
satisfied with manna on the earth; or than the sacrifice of children to
demons; or than the slaying of the prophets. But,” said I, “you appear
to me not to have heard the Scriptures which I said they had stolen
away. For such as have been quoted are more than enough to prove the
points in dispute, besides those which are retained by us, <span
id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223) and shall yet be brought forward.”

<span id="viii.iv.lxxiii-p2"></span> These words were not taken away by
the Jews, but added by some Christian.—<span class="upper"><span

<span id="viii.iv.lxxiii-p3"></span> It is strange that “from the wood”
is not added; but the audacity of the copyists in such matters is well
known.—<span class="upper"><span
id="viii.iv.lxxiii-p3.1"></span>Maranus</span>.

<span id="fn_2223"></span>[235:2224](0010534.htm#fr_2223) <span

<span id="viii.iv.lxxiii-p6"></span> Many think, “you.”
