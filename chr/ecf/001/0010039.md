### <span id="ii.ii.xxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—Great is the reward of good works with God. Joined together in harmony, let us implore that reward from Him.

<span id="ii.ii.xxxiv-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxxiv-p1.2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxiv-p1.3"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxxiv-p1.4"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxiv-p1.5"></span>The good servant <span
id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) receives the bread of his labour with
confidence; the lazy and slothful cannot look his employer in the face.
It is requisite, therefore, that we be prompt in the practice of
well-doing; for of Him are all things. And thus He forewarns us:
“Behold, the Lord \[cometh\], and His reward is before His face, to
render to every man according to his work.” <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) He exhorts us, therefore, with our
whole heart to attend to this, <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md)
that we be not lazy or slothful in any good work. Let our boasting and
our confidence be in Him. Let us submit ourselves to His will. Let us
consider the whole multitude of His angels, how they stand ever ready to
minister to His will. For the Scripture saith, “Ten thousand times ten
thousand stood around Him, and thousands of thousands ministered unto
Him, <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) and cried, Holy, holy,
holy, \[is\] the Lord of Sabaoth; the whole creation is full of His
glory.” <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) And let us therefore,
conscientiously gathering together in harmony, cry to Him earnestly, as
with one mouth, that we may be made partakers of His great and glorious
promises. For \[the Scripture\] saith, “Eye hath not seen, nor ear
heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which He
hath prepared for them that wait for Him.” <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md)
