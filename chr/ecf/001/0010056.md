### <span id="ii.ii.li-p0.1"></span>Chapter LI.—Let the partakers in strife acknowledge their sins.

<span id="ii.ii.li-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.li-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.li-p1.2"></span>Let us therefore implore forgiveness for all
those transgressions which through any \[suggestion\] of the adversary
we have committed. And those who have been the leaders of sedition and
disagreement ought to have respect <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) to the common hope. For such as live
in fear and love would rather that they themselves than their neighbours
should be involved in suffering. And they prefer to bear blame
themselves, rather than that the concord which has been well and
piously <span id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) handed down to us should
suffer. For it is better that a man should acknowledge his
transgressions than that he should harden his heart, as the hearts of
those were hardened who stirred up sedition against Moses the servant of
God, and whose condemnation was made manifest \[unto all\]. For they
went down alive into Hades, and death swallowed them up. <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) Pharaoh with his army and all the
princes of Egypt, and the chariots with their riders, were sunk in the
depths of the Red Sea, and perished, <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) for no other reason than that their
foolish hearts were hardened, after so many signs and wonders had been
wrought in the land of Egypt by Moses the servant of God.
