### <span id="viii.iv.cxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXII.—The Jews expound these signs jejunely and feebly, and take up their attention only with insignificant matters.

<span id="viii.iv.cxii-p1"></span>“But you, expounding these things in a
low \[and earthly\] manner, impute much weakness to God, if you thus
listen to them merely, and do not investigate the force of the words
spoken. Since even Moses would in this way be considered <span
id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span id="viii.iv.cxii-Page_255"></span> a
transgressor: for he enjoined that no likeness of anything in heaven, or
on earth, or in the sea, be made; and then he himself made a brazen
serpent and set it on a standard, and bade those who were bitten look at
it: and they were saved when they looked at it. Will the serpent, then,
which (I have already said) God had in the beginning cursed and cut off
by the great sword, as Isaiah says, <span
id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370) be understood as having preserved
at that time the people? and shall we receive these things in the
foolish acceptation of your teachers, and \[regard\] them not as signs?
And shall we not rather refer the standard to the resemblance of the
crucified Jesus, since also Moses by his outstretched hands, together
with him who was named Jesus (Joshua), achieved a victory for your
people? For in this way we shall cease to be at a loss about the things
which the lawgiver did, when he, without forsaking God, persuaded the
people to hope in a beast through which transgression and disobedience
had their origin. And this was done and said by the blessed prophet with
much intelligence and mystery; and there is nothing said or done by any
one of the prophets, without exception, which one can justly reprehend,
if he possess the knowledge which is in them. But if your teachers only
expound to you why female camels are spoken of in this passage, and are
not in that; or why so many measures of fine flour and so many measures
of oil \[are used\] in the offerings; and do so in a low and sordid
manner, while they never venture either to speak of or to expound the
points which are great and worthy of investigation, or command you to
give no audience to us while we expound them, and to come not into
conversation with us; will they not deserve to hear what our Lord Jesus
Christ said to them: ‘Whited sepulchres, which appear beautiful outward,
and within are full of dead men’s bones; which pay tithe of mint, and
swallow a camel: ye blind guides!’ <span
id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371) If, then, you will not despise the
doctrines of those who exalt themselves and wish to be called Rabbi,
Rabbi, and come with such earnestness and intelligence to the words of
prophecy as to suffer the same inflictions from your own people which
the prophets themselves did, you cannot receive any advantage whatsoever
from the prophetic writings.
