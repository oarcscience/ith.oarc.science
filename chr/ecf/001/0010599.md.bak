### <span id="viii.iv.cxxxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXXVIII.—Noah is a figure of Christ, who has regenerated us by water, and faith, and wood: \[i.e., *the cross*.\]

<span id="viii.iv.cxxxviii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxxviii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxxviii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxxviii-p1.3"></span>“You know, then, sirs,” I said, “that
God has said in Isaiah to Jerusalem: ‘I saved thee in the deluge of
Noah.’ <span id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478.md) By this which God said
was meant that the mystery of saved men appeared in the deluge. For
righteous Noah, along with the other mortals at the deluge, i.e., with
his own wife, his three sons and their wives, being eight in number,
were a symbol of the eighth day, wherein Christ appeared when He rose
from the dead, for ever the first in power. For Christ, being the
first-born of every creature, became again the chief of another race
regenerated by Himself through water, and faith, and wood, containing
the mystery of the cross; even as Noah was saved by wood when he rode
over the waters with his household. Accordingly, when the prophet says,
‘I saved thee in the times of Noah,’ as I have already remarked, he
addresses the people who are equally faithful to God, and possess the
same signs. For when Moses had the rod in his hands, he led your nation
through the sea. And you believe that this was spoken to your nation
only, or to the land. But the whole earth, as the Scripture says, was
inundated, and the water rose in height fifteen cubits above all the
mountains: so that it is evident this was not spoken to the land, but to
the people who obeyed Him: for whom also He had before prepared a
resting-place in Jerusalem, as was previously demonstrated by all the
symbols of the deluge; I mean, that by water, faith, and wood, those who
are afore-prepared, and who repent of the sins which they have
committed, shall escape from the impending judgment of God.

<span id="fn_2478"></span>[268:2479](0010599.htm#fr_2478.md) <span

<span id="viii.iv.cxxxviii-p2"></span> [Isa. liv.
9](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#009.md)<span
id="viii.iv.cxxxviii-p2.1"></span> comes nearer to these words than any
other passage; but still the exact quotation is not in Isaiah, or in any
other part of Scripture. \[It is quite probable that [Isa. liv.
9](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#009.md)<span
id="viii.iv.cxxxviii-p2.2"></span> was thus misunderstood by the Jews,
as Trypho seems to acquiesce.\]
