### <span id="viii.xi.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Examination of Justin by the prefect.

class="upper"><span id="viii.xi.i-p1.4"></span>In</span> the time of the
lawless partisans of idolatry, wicked decrees were passed against the
godly Christians in town and country, to force them to offer libations
to vain idols; and accordingly the holy men, having been apprehended,
were brought before the prefect of Rome, Rusticus by name. And when they
had been brought before his judgment-seat, said to Justin, “Obey the
gods at once, and submit to the kings.” <span
id="fr_2642"></span>[2643](#fn_2642.md) Justin said, “To obey the
commandments of our Saviour Jesus Christ is worthy neither of blame nor
of condemnation.” Rusticus the prefect said, “What kind of doctrines do
you profess?” Justin said, “I have endeavoured to learn all doctrines;
but I have acquiesced at last in the true doctrines, those namely of the
Christians, even though they do not please those who hold false
opinions.” Rusticus the prefect said, “Are those the doctrines that
please you, you utterly wretched man?” Justin said, “Yes, since I adhere
to them with right dogma.” <span id="fr_2643"></span>[2644](#fn_2643.md)
Rusticus the prefect said, “What is the dogma?” Justin said, “That
according to which we worship the God of the Christians, whom we reckon
to be one from the beginning, the maker and fashioner of the whole
creation, visible and invisible; and the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of
God, who had also been preached beforehand by the prophets as about to
be present with the race of men, the herald of salvation and teacher of
good disciples. And I, being a man, think that what I can say is
insignificant in comparison with His boundless divinity, acknowledging a
certain prophetic power, <span id="fr_2644"></span>[2645](#fn_2644.md)
since it was prophesied concerning Him of whom now I say that He is the
Son of God. For I know that of old the prophets foretold His appearance
among men.”
