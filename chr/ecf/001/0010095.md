### <span id="iv.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Concerning the transmission of epistles.

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Both
you and Ignatius <span id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410) wrote to me,
that if any one went \[from this\] into Syria, he should carry your
letter <span id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411) with him; which request I
will attend to if I find a fitting opportunity, either personally, or
through some other acting for me, that your desire may be fulfilled. The
Epistles of Ignatius written by him <span
id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412) to us, and all the rest \[of his
Epistles\] which we have by us, we have sent to you, as you requested.
They are subjoined to this Epistle, and by them ye may be greatly
profited; for they treat of faith and patience, and all things that tend
to edification in our Lord. Any <span id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413)
more certain information you may have obtained respecting both Ignatius
himself, and those that were <span id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414)
with him, have the goodness to make known <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415) to us.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_410"></span>[36:411](0010095.htm#fr_410) <span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p1.2"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p2"></span> Comp. Ep. of Ignatius to Polycarp,
chap. viii.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[36:412](0010095.htm#fr_411) <span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p3"></span> Or, “letters.”

<span id="fn_412"></span>[36:413](0010095.htm#fr_412) <span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p4"></span> Reference is here made to the two
letters of Ignatius, one to Polycarp himself, and the other to the
church at Smyrna.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[36:414](0010095.htm#fr_413) <span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p5"></span> Henceforth, to the end, we have only
the Latin version.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[36:415](0010095.htm#fr_414) <span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p6"></span> The Latin version reads “are,” which
has been corrected as above.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[36:416](0010095.htm#fr_415) <span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p7"></span> Polycarp was aware of the death of
Ignatius (chap. ix.), but was as yet apparently ignorant of the
circumstances attending it. \[Who can fail to be touched by these
affectionate yet entirely calm expressions as to his martyred friend and
brother? Martyrdom was the habitual end of Christ’s soldiers, and
Polycarp expected his own; hence his restrained and temperate words of
interest.\]
