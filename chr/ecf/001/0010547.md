### <span id="viii.iv.lxxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXXVI.—There are various figures in the Old Testament of the wood of the cross by which Christ reigned.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxxvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxxvi-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxxvi-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxxvi-p1.3"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxxvi-p1.4"></span>And when I had quoted this, I added,
“Hear, then, how this Man, of whom the Scriptures declare that He will
come again in glory after His crucifixion, was symbolized both by the
tree of life, which was said to have been planted in paradise, and by
those events which should happen to all the just. Moses was sent with a
rod to effect the redemption of the people; and with this in his hands
at the head of the people, he divided the sea. By this he saw the water
gushing out of the rock; and when he cast a tree into the waters of
Marah, which were bitter, he made them sweet. Jacob, by putting rods
into the water-troughs, caused the sheep of his uncle to conceive, so
that he should obtain their young. With his rod the same Jacob boasts
that he had crossed the river. He said he had seen a ladder, and the
Scripture has declared that God stood above it. But that this was not
the Father, we have proved from the Scriptures. And Jacob, having poured
oil on a stone in the same place, is testified to by the very God who
appeared to him, that he had anointed a pillar to the God who appeared
to him. And that the stone symbolically proclaimed Christ, we have also
proved by many Scriptures; and that the unguent, whether it was of oil,
or of *stacte*, <span id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285.md) or of any
other compounded sweet balsams, had reference to Him, we have also
proved, <span id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286.md) inasmuch as the word
says: ‘Therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of
gladness above Thy fellows.’ <span id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md)
For indeed all kings and anointed persons obtained from Him their share
in the names of kings and anointed: just as He Himself received from the
Father the titles of King, and Christ, and Priest, and Angel, and such
like other titles which He bears or did bear. Aaron’s rod, which
blossomed, declared him to be the high priest. Isaiah prophesied that a
rod would come forth from the root of Jesse, \[and this was\] Christ.
And David says that the righteous man is ‘like the tree that is planted
by the channels of waters, which should yield its fruit in its season,
and whose leaf should not fade.’ <span
id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288.md) Again, the righteous is said to
flourish like the palm-tree. God appeared from a tree to Abraham, as it
is written, near the oak in Mamre. The people found seventy willows and
twelve springs after crossing the Jordan. <span
id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289.md) David affirms that God comforted
him with a rod and staff. Elisha, by casting a stick <span
id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290.md) into the river Jordan, recovered
the iron part of the axe with which the sons of the prophets had gone to
cut down trees to build the house in which they wished to read and study
the law and commandments of God; even as our Christ, by being crucified
on the tree, and by purifying \[us\] with water, has redeemed us, though
plunged in the direst offences which we have committed, and has made
\[us\] a house of prayer and adoration. Moreover, it was a rod that
pointed out Judah to be the father of Tamar’s sons by a great mystery.”
