### <span id="v.vii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Thanks to God for your faith.

<span id="v.vii.i-p1"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.vii.i-p1.1"></span>I Glorify</span> God, even Jesus Christ, who
has given you such wisdom. <span id="v.vii.i-p1.2"></span><span
id="v.vii.i-p1.3"></span><span id="v.vii.i-p1.4"></span>For I have
observed that ye are perfected in an immoveable faith, as if ye were
nailed to the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, both in the flesh and in
the spirit, and are established in love through the blood of Christ,
being fully persuaded with respect to our Lord, that He was truly of the
seed of David according to the flesh, <span
id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974.md) and the Son of God according to the
will and power <span id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975.md) of God; that He
was truly born of a virgin, was baptized by John, in order that all
righteousness might be fulfilled <span id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976.md)
by Him; and was truly, under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch,
nailed \[to the cross\] for us in His flesh. Of this fruit <span
id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977.md) we are by His divinely-blessed
passion, that He might set up a standard <span
id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978.md) for all ages, through His
resurrection, to all His holy and faithful \[followers\], whether among
Jews or Gentiles, in the one body of His Church.

<span id="v.vii.i-p7"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.vii.i-p7.1"></span>I Glorify</span> the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, who by Him has given you such wisdom. <span
id="v.vii.i-p7.2"></span><span id="v.vii.i-p7.3"></span><span
id="v.vii.i-p7.4"></span>For I have observed that ye are perfected in an
immoveable faith, as if ye were nailed to the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ, both in the flesh and in the spirit, and are established in love
through the blood of Christ, being fully persuaded, in very truth, with
respect to our Lord Jesus Christ, that He was the Son of God, “the
first-born of every creature,” <span id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979.md)
God the Word, the only-begotten Son, and was of the seed of David
according to the flesh, <span id="fr_980"></span>[981](#fn_980.md) by the
Virgin Mary; was baptized by John, that all righteousness might be
fulfilled <span id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981.md) by Him; that He lived
a life of holiness without sin, and was truly, under Pontius Pilate and
Herod the tetrarch, nailed \[to the cross\] for us in His flesh. From
whom we also derive our being, <span id="fr_982"></span>[983](#fn_982.md)
from His divinely-blessed passion, that He might set up a standard for
the ages, through His resurrection, to all His holy and faithful
\[followers\], whether among Jews or Gentiles, in the one body of His
Church.
