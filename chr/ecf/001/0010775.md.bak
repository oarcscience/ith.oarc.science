### <span id="ix.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Answer to an objection, arising from the words of Christ ([Matt. vi. 24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024)<span id="ix.iv.ix-p0.2"></span>.md). God alone is to be really called God and Lord, for He is without beginning and end.

<span id="ix.iv.ix-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>This
calumny, then, of these men, having been quashed, it is clearly proved
that neither the prophets nor the apostles did ever name another God, or
call \[him\] Lord, except the true and only God. Much more \[would this
be the case with regard to\] the Lord Himself, who did also direct us to
“render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the things
that are God’s;” <span id="fr_3363"></span>[3364](#fn_3363.md) naming
indeed Cæsar as Cæsar, but confessing God as God. In like manner also,
that \[text\] which says, “Ye cannot serve two masters,” <span
id="fr_3364"></span>[3365](#fn_3364.md) He does Himself interpret, saying,
“Ye cannot serve God and mammon;” acknowledging God indeed as God, but
mentioning mammon, a thing having also an existence. He does not call
mammon Lord when He says, “Ye cannot serve two masters;” but He teaches
His disciples who serve God, not to be subject to mammon, nor to be
ruled by it. For He says, “He that committeth sin is the slave of
sin.” <span id="fr_3365"></span>[3366](#fn_3365.md) Inasmuch, then, as He
terms those “the slaves of sin” who serve sin, but does not certainly
call sin itself God, thus also He terms those who serve mammon “the
slaves of mammon,” not calling mammon God. For mammon is, according to
the Jewish language, which the Samaritans do also use, a *covetous* man,
and one who wishes to have more than he ought to have. But according to
the Hebrew, it is by the addition of a syllable (*adjunctive*) called
Mamuel, <span id="fr_3366"></span>[3367](#fn_3366.md) and signifies
*gulosum*, that is, one whose gullet is insatiable. Therefore, according
to both these things which are indicated, we cannot serve God and
mammon.

<span id="ix.iv.ix-p6"></span>2. But also, when He spoke of the devil as
strong, not absolutely so, but as in comparison with us, the Lord showed
Himself under every aspect and truly to be the strong man, saying that
one can in no other way “spoil the goods of a strong man, if he do not
first bind the strong man himself, and then he will spoil his
house.” <span id="fr_3367"></span>[3368](#fn_3367.md) Now we were the
vessels and the house of this \[strong man\] when we were in a state of
apostasy; for he put us to whatever use he pleased, and the unclean
spirit dwelt within us. For he was not strong, as opposed to Him who
bound him, and spoiled his house; but as against those persons who were
his tools, inasmuch as he caused their thought to wander away from God:
these did the Lord snatch from his grasp. As also Jeremiah declares,
“The <span class="upper"><span id="ix.iv.ix-p7.2"></span>Lord</span>
hath redeemed Jacob, and has snatched him from the hand of him that was
stronger than he.” <span id="fr_3368"></span>[3369](#fn_3368.md) If, then,
he had not pointed out Him who binds and spoils his goods, but had
merely spoken of him as being strong, the strong man should have been
unconquered. But he also subjoined Him who obtains and retains
possession; for *he* holds who binds, but *he is* held who is bound. And
this he did without any comparison, so that, apostate slave as he was,
he might not be compared to the Lord: for not he alone, but not one of
created and subject things, shall ever be compared to the Word of God,
by whom all things were made, who is our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="ix.iv.ix-p9"></span>3. For that all things, whether Angels, or
Archangels, or Thrones, or Dominions, were both established and created
by Him who is God over all, through His Word, John has thus pointed out.
For when he had spoken of the Word of God as having been in the Father,
he added, “All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything
made.” <span id="fr_3369"></span>[3370](#fn_3369.md) David also, when he
had enumerated \[His\] praises, subjoins by name all things whatsoever I
have mentioned, both the heavens and all the powers therein: “For He
commanded, and they were created; He spake, and they were made.” Whom,
therefore, did He command? The Word, no doubt, “by whom,” he says, “the
heavens were established, and all their power by the breath of His
mouth.” <span id="fr_3370"></span>[3371](#fn_3370.md) But that He did
Himself <span id="page_422">p. 422</span> <span
id="ix.iv.ix-Page_422"></span> make all things freely, and as He
pleased, again David says, “But our God is in the heavens above, and in
the earth; He hath made all things whatsoever He pleased.” <span
id="fr_3371"></span>[3372](#fn_3371.md) But the things established are
distinct from Him who has established them, and what have been made from
Him who has made them. For He is Himself uncreated, both without
beginning and end, and lacking nothing. He is Himself sufficient for
Himself; and still further, He grants to all others this very thing,
existence; but the things which have been made by Him have received a
beginning. But whatever things had a beginning, and are liable to
dissolution, and are subject to and stand in need of Him who made them,
must necessarily in all respects have a different term \[applied to
them\], even by those who have but a moderate capacity for discerning
such things; so that He indeed who made all things can alone, together
with His Word, properly be termed God and Lord: but the things which
have been made cannot have this term applied to them, neither should
they justly assume that appellation which belongs to the Creator.

suspect the reading to be corrupt, through the ignorance and
