### <span id="ii.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Continuation of the above.

<span id="ii.ii.x-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.x-p1.1"></span>Abraham,
styled “the friend,” <span id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) was found
faithful, inasmuch as he rendered obedience to the words of God. He, in
the exercise of obedience, went out from his own country, and from his
kindred, and from his father’s house, in order that, by forsaking a
small territory, and a weak family, and an insignificant house, he might
inherit the promises of God. For God said to him, “Get thee out from thy
country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, into the
land which I shall show thee. And I will make thee a great nation, and
will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shall be blessed. And
I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee; and
in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.” <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) And again, on his departing from Lot, God
said to him. “Lift up thine eyes, and look from the place where thou now
art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward; for all the
land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, \[so that\] if a man
can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be
numbered.” <span id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) And again \[the
Scripture\] saith, “God brought forth Abram, and spake unto him, Look up
now to heaven, and count the stars if thou be able to number them; so
shall thy seed be. And Abram believed God, and it was counted to him for
righteousness.” <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) On account of his
faith and hospitality, a son <span id="page_8">p. 8</span> <span
id="ii.ii.x-Page_8"></span> was given him in his old age; and in the
exercise of obedience, he offered him as a sacrifice to God on one of
the mountains which He showed him. <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md)
