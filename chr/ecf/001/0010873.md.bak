### <span id="ix.vii.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—He contends that these testimonies already alleged cannot be understood allegorically of celestial blessings, but that they shall have their fulfilment after the coming of Antichrist, and the resurrection, in the terrestrial Jerusalem. To the former prophecies he subjoins others drawn from Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the Apocalypse of John.

<span id="ix.vii.xxxvi-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>If, however, any shall endeavour to
allegorize \[prophecies\] of this kind, they shall not be found
consistent with themselves in all points, and shall be confuted by the
teaching of the very expressions \[in question\]. For example: “When the
cities” of the Gentiles “shall be desolate, so that they be not
inhabited, and the houses so that there shall be no men in them and the
land shall be left desolate.” <span id="fr_4764"></span>[4765](#fn_4764.md)
“For, behold,” says Isaiah, “the day of the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xxxvi-p2.2"></span>Lord</span> cometh past remedy, full of
fury and wrath, to lay waste the city of the earth, and to root sinners
out of it.” <span id="fr_4765"></span>[4766](#fn_4765.md) And again he
says, “Let him be taken away, that he behold not the glory of
God.” <span id="fr_4766"></span>[4767](#fn_4766.md) And when these things
are done, he says, “God will remove men far away, and those that are
left shall multiply in the earth.” <span
id="fr_4767"></span>[4768](#fn_4767.md) “And they shall build houses, and
shall inhabit them themselves: and plant vineyards, and eat of them
themselves.” <span id="fr_4768"></span>[4769](#fn_4768.md) For all these
and other words were unquestionably spoken in reference to the
resurrection of the just, which takes place after the coming of
Antichrist, and the destruction of all nations under his rule; in \[the
times of\] which \[resurrection\] the righteous shall reign in the
earth, waxing stronger by the sight of the Lord: and through Him they
shall become accustomed to partake in the glory of God the Father, and
shall enjoy in the kingdom intercourse and communion with the holy
angels, and union with spiritual beings; and \[with respect to\] those
whom the Lord shall find in the flesh, awaiting Him from heaven, and who
have suffered tribulation, as well as escaped the hands of the Wicked
one. For it is in reference to them that the prophet says: “And those
that are left shall multiply upon the earth,” And Jeremiah <span
id="fr_4769"></span>[4770](#fn_4769.md) the prophet has pointed out, that
as many believers as God has prepared for this purpose, to multiply
those left upon earth, should both be under the rule of the saints to
minister to this Jerusalem, and that \[His\] kingdom shall be in it,
saying, “Look around Jerusalem towards the east, and behold the joy
which comes to thee from God Himself. Behold, thy sons shall come whom
thou hast sent forth: they shall come in a band from the east even unto
the west, by the word of that Holy One, rejoicing in that splendour
which is from thy God. O Jerusalem, put off thy robe of mourning and of
affliction, and put on that beauty of eternal splendour from thy God.
Gird thyself with the double garment of that righteousness proceeding
from thy God; place the mitre of eternal glory upon thine head. For God
will show thy glory to the whole earth under heaven. For thy name shall
for ever be called by God Himself, the peace of righteousness and glory
to him that worships God. Arise, Jerusalem, stand on high, and look
towards the east, and behold thy sons from the rising of the sun, even
to the west, by the Word of that Holy One, rejoicing in the very
remembrance of God. For the footmen have gone forth from thee, while
they were drawn away by the enemy. God shall bring them in to thee,
being borne with glory as the throne of a kingdom. For God has decreed
that every high mountain shall be brought low, and the eternal hills,
and that the valleys be filled, so that the surface of the earth be
rendered smooth, that Israel, the glory of God, may walk in safety. The
woods, too, shall make shady places, and every sweet-smelling tree shall
be for Israel itself by the command of God. For God shall go before with
joy in the light of His splendour, with the pity and righteousness which
proceeds from Him.”

<span id="ix.vii.xxxvi-p8"></span>2. Now all these things being such as
they are, cannot be understood in reference to super-celestial matters;
“for God,” it is said, “will show to the whole earth that is under
heaven thy glory.” But in the times of the kingdom, the earth has been
called again by Christ \[to its pristine condition\], and Jerusalem
rebuilt after the pattern of the Jerusalem above, of which the prophet
Isaiah says, “Behold, I have depicted thy walls upon my hands, and thou
art always in <span id="page_566">p. 566</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xxxvi-Page_566"></span> my sight.” <span
id="fr_4770"></span>[4771](#fn_4770.md) And the apostle, too, writing to
the Galatians, says in like manner, “But the Jerusalem which is above is
free, which is the mother of us all.” <span
id="fr_4771"></span>[4772](#fn_4771.md) He does not say this with any
thought of an erratic Æon, or of any other power which departed from the
Pleroma, or of Prunicus, but of the Jerusalem which has been delineated
on \[God’s\] hands. And in the Apocalypse John saw this new
\[Jerusalem\] descending upon the new earth. <span
id="fr_4772"></span>[4773](#fn_4772.md) For after the times of the kingdom,
he says, “I saw a great white throne, and Him who sat upon it, from
whose face the earth fled away, and the heavens; and there was no more
place for them.” <span id="fr_4773"></span>[4774](#fn_4773.md) And he sets
forth, too, the things connected with the general resurrection and the
judgment, mentioning “the dead, great and small.” “The sea,” he says,
“gave up the dead which it had in it, and death and hell delivered up
the dead that they contained; and the books were opened. Moreover,” he
says, “the book of life was opened, and the dead were judged out of
those things that were written in the books, according to their works;
and death and hell were sent into the lake of fire, the second
death.” <span id="fr_4774"></span>[4775](#fn_4774.md) Now this is what is
called Gehenna, which the Lord styled eternal fire. <span
id="fr_4775"></span>[4776](#fn_4775.md) “And if any one,” it is said, “was
not found written in the book of life, he was sent into the lake of
fire.” <span id="fr_4776"></span>[4777](#fn_4776.md) And after this, he
says, “I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and
earth have passed away; also there was no more sea. And I saw the holy
city, new Jerusalem, coming down from heaven, as a bride adorned for her
husband.” “And I heard,” it is said, “a great voice from the throne,
saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell
with them; and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with
them as their God. And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and
death shall be no more, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there
be any more pain, because the former things have passed away.” <span
id="fr_4777"></span>[4778](#fn_4777.md) Isaiah also declares the very same:
“For there shall be a new heaven and a new earth; and there shall be no
remembrance of the former, neither shall the heart think about them, but
they shall find in it joy and exultation.” <span
id="fr_4778"></span>[4779](#fn_4778.md) Now this is what has been said by
the apostle: “For the fashion of this world passeth away.” <span
id="fr_4779"></span>[4780](#fn_4779.md) To the same purpose did the Lord
also declare, “Heaven and earth shall pass away.” <span
id="fr_4780"></span>[4781](#fn_4780.md) When these things, therefore, pass
away above the earth, John, the Lord’s disciple, says that the new
Jerusalem above shall \[then\] descend, as a bride adorned for her
husband; and that this is the tabernacle of God, in which God will dwell
with men. Of this Jerusalem the former one is an image—that Jerusalem of
the former earth in which the righteous are disciplined beforehand for
incorruption and prepared for salvation. And of this tabernacle Moses
received the pattern in the mount; <span
id="fr_4781"></span>[4782](#fn_4781.md) and nothing is capable of being
allegorized, but all things are stedfast, and true, and substantial,
having been made by God for righteous men’s enjoyment. For as it is God
truly who raises up man, so also does man truly rise from the dead, and
not allegorically, as I have shown repeatedly. And as he rises actually,
so also shall he be actually disciplined beforehand for incorruption,
and shall go forwards and flourish in the times of the kingdom, in order
that he may be capable of receiving the glory of the Father. Then, when
all things are made new, he shall truly dwell in the city of God. For it
is said, “He that sitteth on the throne said, Behold, I make all things
new. And the Lord says, Write all this; for these words are faithful and
true. And He said to me, They are done.” <span
id="fr_4782"></span>[4783](#fn_4782.md) And this is the truth of the
matter.
