### <span id="viii.iv.xcii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XCII.—Unless the scriptures be understood through God’s great grace, God will not appear to have taught always the same righteousness.

<span id="viii.iv.xcii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xcii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xcii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xcii-p1.3"></span>“Unless, therefore, a man by God’s great
grace receives the power to understand what has been said and done by
the prophets, the appearance of being able to repeat the words or the
deeds will not profit him, if he cannot explain the argument of them.
And will they not assuredly appear contemptible to many, since they are
related by those who understood them not? <span
id="viii.iv.xcii-p1.4"></span>For if one should wish to ask you why,
since Enoch, Noah with his sons, and all others in similar
circumstances, who neither were circumcised nor kept the Sabbath,
pleased God, God demanded by other leaders, and by the giving of the law
after the lapse of so many generations, that those who lived between the
times of Abraham and of Moses be justified by circumcision, and that
those who lived after Moses be justified by circumcision and the other
ordinances—to wit, the Sabbath, and sacrifices, and libations, <span
id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306.md) and offerings; \[God will be
slandered\] unless you show, as I have already said, that God who
foreknew was aware that your nation would deserve expulsion from
Jerusalem, and that none would be permitted to enter into it. (For <span
id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307.md) you are not distinguished in any
other way than by the fleshly circumcision, as I remarked previously.
For Abraham was declared by God to be righteous, not on account of
circumcision, but on account of faith. For before he was circumcised the
following statement was made regarding him: ‘Abraham believed God, and
it was accounted unto him for righteousness.’ <span
id="fr_2308"></span>[2309](#fn_2308.md) And we, therefore, in the
uncircumcision of our flesh, believing God through Christ, and having
that circumcision which is of advantage to us who have acquired it
—namely, that of the heart—we hope to appear righteous before and
well-pleasing to God: since already we have received His testimony
through the words of the prophets.) \[And, further, God will be
slandered unless you show\] that you were commanded to observe the
Sabbath, and to present offerings, and that the Lord submitted to have a
place called by the name of God, in order that, as has been said, you
might not become impious and godless by worshipping idols and forgetting
God, as indeed you do always appear to have been. (Now, that God
enjoined the ordinances of Sabbaths and offerings for these reasons, I
have proved in what I previously remarked; but for the sake of those who
came to-day, I <span id="page_246">p. 246</span> <span
id="viii.iv.xcii-Page_246"></span> wish to repeat nearly the whole.) For
if this is not the case, God will be slandered, <span
id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309.md) as having no foreknowledge, and as
not teaching all men to know and to do the same acts of righteousness
(for many generations of men appear to have existed before Moses); and
the Scripture is not true which affirms that ‘God is true and righteous,
and all His ways are judgments, and there is no unrighteousness in him.’
But since the Scripture is true, God is always willing that such even as
you be neither foolish nor lovers of yourselves, in order that you may
obtain the salvation of Christ, <span
id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310.md) who pleased God, and received
testimony from Him, as I have already said, by alleging proof from the
holy words of prophecy.
