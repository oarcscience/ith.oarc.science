## <span id="viii.x-p0.1"></span>Introductory Note to the Martyrdom of Justin Martyr

<span id="viii.x-p1"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="viii.x-p1.1"></span>Crescens</span>, a cynic, has the ill-renown of
stirring up the persecution in which Justin and his friends suffered for
Christ. The story that he died by the hemlock seems to have originated
among the Greeks, who naturally gave this turn to the sufferings of a
philosopher. The following <span class="upper"><span
id="viii.x-p1.2"></span>Introductory Notice</span> of the translator
supplies all that need be added.

<span id="viii.x-p2"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="viii.x-p2.1"></span>Though</span> nothing is known as to the date or
authorship of the following narrative, it is generally reckoned among
the most trustworthy of the Martyria. An absurd addition was in some
copies made to it, to the effect that Justin died by means of hemlock.
Some have thought it necessary, on account of this story, to conceive of
two Justins, one of whom, the celebrated defender of the Christian faith
whose writings are given in this volume, died through poison, while the
other suffered in the way here described, along with several of his
friends. But the description of Justin given in the following account,
is evidently such as compels us to refer it to the famous apologist and
martyr of the second century. <span id="fr_2641"></span>[2642](#fn_2641)

Epiphanius, by fixing the martyrdom under the prefecture of Rusticus,
seems to identify this history; but, then, he also connects it with the
reign of Hadrian. Ed. Oehler, tom ii. 709. Berlin, 1859.\]
