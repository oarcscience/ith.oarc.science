### <span id="iv.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The duties of presbyters and others.

<span id="iv.ii.vi-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.vi-p1.1"></span><span
id="iv.ii.vi-p1.2"></span>And let the presbyters be compassionate and
merciful to all, bringing back those that wander, visiting all the sick,
and not neglecting the widow, the orphan, or the poor, but always
“providing for that which is becoming in the sight of God and
man;” <span id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373.md) abstaining from all wrath,
respect of persons, and unjust judgment; keeping far off from all
covetousness, not quickly crediting \[an evil report\] against any one,
not severe in judgment, as knowing that we are all under a debt of sin.
If then we entreat the Lord to forgive us, we ought also ourselves to
forgive; <span id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374.md) for we are before the
eyes of our Lord and God, and “we must all appear at the judgment-seat
of Christ, and must every one give an account of himself.” <span
id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md) Let us then serve Him in fear, and
with all reverence, even as He Himself has commanded us, and as the
apostles who preached the Gospel unto us, and the prophets who
proclaimed beforehand the coming of the Lord \[have alike taught us\].
Let us be zealous in the pursuit of that which is good, keeping
ourselves from causes of offence, from false brethren, and from those
who in hypocrisy bear the name of the Lord, and draw away vain men into
error.
