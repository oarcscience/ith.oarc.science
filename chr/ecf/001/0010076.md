<span id="iii.ii.ix"></span>

### <span id="iii.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Why the Son was sent so late.

<span id="iii.ii.ix-p1"></span><span id="iii.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>As long
then as the former time <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308) endured,
He permitted us to be borne along by unruly impulses, being drawn away
by the desire of pleasure and various lusts. This was not that He at all
delighted in our sins, but that He simply endured them; nor that He
approved the time of working iniquity which then was, but that He sought
to form a mind conscious of righteousness, <span
id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309) so that being convinced in that time
of our unworthiness of attaining life through our own works, it should
now, through the kindness of God, be vouchsafed to us; and having made
it manifest that in ourselves we were unable to enter into the kingdom
of God, we might through the power of God be made able. <span
id="iii.ii.ix-p3.1"></span>But when our wickedness had reached its
height, and it had been clearly shown that its reward, <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310) punishment and death, was impending
over us; and when the time had come which God had before appointed for
manifesting His own kindness and power, how <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311) the one love of God, through exceeding
regard for men, did not regard us with hatred, nor thrust us away, nor
remember our iniquity against us, but showed great long-suffering, and
bore with us, <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312) He Himself took on
Him the burden of our iniquities, He gave His own Son as a ransom for
us, the holy One for transgressors, the blameless One for the wicked,
the righteous One for the unrighteous, the incorruptible One for the
corruptible, the immortal One for them that are mortal. For what other
thing was capable of covering our sins than His righteousness? By what
other one was it possible that we, the wicked and ungodly, could be
justified, than by the only Son of God? O sweet exchange! O unsearchable
operation! O benefits surpassing all expectation! that the wickedness of
many should be hid in a single righteous One, and that the righteousness
of One should justify many transgressors! <span
id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313) Having therefore convinced us in the
former time <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314) that our nature was
unable to attain to life, and having now revealed the Saviour who is
able to save even those things which it was \[formerly\] impossible to
save, by both these facts He desired to lead us to trust in His
kindness, to esteem Him our Nourisher, Father, Teacher, Counsellor,
Healer, our Wisdom, Light, Honour, Glory, Power, and Life, so that we
should not be anxious <span id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315) concerning
clothing and food.

<span id="iii.ii.ix-p2"></span> Otto refers for a like contrast between
these two times to [Rom. iii.
21-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021)<span
id="iii.ii.ix-p2.1"></span>, [Rom. v.
20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020)<span id="iii.ii.ix-p2.2"></span>
and [Gal. iv. 4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004)<span

<span id="fn_309"></span>[28:310](0010076.htm#fr_309) <span
id="iii.ii.ix-p2.5"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ix-p3"></span> The reading and sense are doubtful.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[28:311](0010076.htm#fr_310) <span
id="iii.ii.ix-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ix-p4"></span> Both the text and rendering are here
somewhat doubtful, but the sense will in any case be much the same.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[28:312](0010076.htm#fr_311) <span
id="iii.ii.ix-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ix-p5"></span> Many variations here occur in the way in
which the *lacuna* of the <span class="upper"><span
id="iii.ii.ix-p5.1"></span>mss.</span> is to be supplied. They do not,
however, greatly affect the meaning.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[28:313](0010076.htm#fr_312) <span
id="iii.ii.ix-p5.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ix-p6"></span> In the <span class="upper"><span
id="iii.ii.ix-p6.1"></span>ms.</span> “saying” is here inserted, as if
the words had been regarded as a quotation from [Isa. liii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011)<span id="iii.ii.ix-p6.2"></span>.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[28:314](0010076.htm#fr_313) <span
id="iii.ii.ix-p6.3"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ix-p7"></span> \[See Bossuet, who quotes it as from
Justin Martyr (Tom. iii. p. 171). Sermon on Circumcision.\]

<span id="fn_314"></span>[28:315](0010076.htm#fr_314) <span
id="iii.ii.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ix-p8"></span> That is, before Christ appeared.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[28:316](0010076.htm#fr_315) <span
id="iii.ii.ix-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ix-p9"></span> Comp. [Matt. vi.
25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025)<span id="iii.ii.ix-p9.1"></span>,
etc. \[Mathetes, in a single sentence, expounds a most practical text
with comprehensive views.\]
