### <span id="ix.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The doctrines of the followers of Ptolemy and Colorbasus.

<span id="ix.ii.xiii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.ii.xiii-p1.2"></span>But the
followers of Ptolemy say <span id="fr_2804"></span>[2805](#fn_2804) that
he <span id="ix.ii.xiii-p2.1"></span>\[Bythus\] has two consorts, which
they also name <span id="ix.ii.xiii-p2.2"></span>*Diatheses*
(affections), viz., Ennœa and <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p2.3"></span>Thelesis. For, as they affirm, he first
conceived the thought of producing something, and then willed to that
effect. Wherefore, again, these two affections, or powers, <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p2.4"></span>Ennœa and Thelesis, having intercourse, as
it were, between themselves, the production of Monogenes and <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p2.5"></span>Aletheia took place according to
conjunction. These two came forth as types and images of the two
affections of the Father,—visible representations of those that were
invisible,—<span id="ix.ii.xiii-p2.6"></span>Nous (i.e., <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p2.7"></span>Monogenes) of Thelesis, and Aletheia of
Ennœa, and accordingly the image resulting from Thelesis was
masculine, <span id="fr_2805"></span>[2806](#fn_2805) while that from
Ennœa was feminine. Thus Thelesis (will) became, as it were, a faculty
of Ennœa (thought). For Ennœa continually yearned after offspring; but
she could not of herself bring forth that which she desired. But when
the power of Thelesis (the faculty of will) came upon her, then she
brought forth that on which she had brooded.

<span id="ix.ii.xiii-p4"></span>2. <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p4.1"></span>These fancied beings <span
id="fr_2806"></span>[2807](#fn_2806) (like the Jove of Homer, who is
represented <span id="fr_2807"></span>[2808](#fn_2807) as passing an
anxious sleepless night in devising plans for honouring Achilles and
destroying numbers of the Greeks) will not appear to you, my dear
friend, to be possessed of greater knowledge than He who is the God of
the universe. He, as soon as He thinks, also performs what He has
willed; and as soon as He wills, also thinks that which He has willed;
then thinking when He wills, and then willing when He thinks, since He
is all thought, \[all will, all mind, all light,\] <span
id="fr_2808"></span>[2809](#fn_2808) all eye, all ear, the one entire
fountain of all good things.

<span id="ix.ii.xiii-p8"></span>3. <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p8.1"></span>Those of them, however, who are deemed more
skilful than the persons who have just been mentioned, say that the
first Ogdoad was not produced gradually, so that one Æon was sent forth
by another, but that all <span id="fr_2809"></span>[2810](#fn_2809) the
Æons were brought into existence at once by <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p9.1"></span>Propator and his Ennœa. He (Colorbasus)
affirms this as confidently as if he had assisted at their birth. <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p9.2"></span>Accordingly, he and his followers maintain
that Anthropos and Ecclesia were not produced, <span
id="fr_2810"></span>[2811](#fn_2810) as others hold, from Logos and Zoe;
but, on the contrary, Logos and Zoe from Anthropos and Ecclesia. But
they express this in another form, as follows: When the Propator
conceived the thought of producing something, he received the name of
*Father*. But because what he did produce was *true*, it was named
Aletheia. Again, when he wished to reveal himself, this was termed
Anthropos. <span id="ix.ii.xiii-p10.1"></span>Finally, when he produced
those whom he had previously thought of, these were named Ecclesia.
Anthropos, by speaking, formed Logos: this is the first-born son. But
Zoe followed upon Logos; and thus the first Ogdoad was completed.

<span id="ix.ii.xiii-p11"></span>4. <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p11.1"></span><span id="ix.ii.xiii-p11.2"></span>They
have much contention also among themselves respecting the Saviour. For
some <span id="page_334">p. 334</span> <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-Page_334"></span> maintain that he was formed out of all;
wherefore also he was called Eudocetos, because the whole Pleroma was
*well pleased* through him to glorify the Father. But others assert that
he was produced from those ten Æons alone who sprung from Logos and Zoe,
and that on this account he was called Logos and Zoe, thus preserving
the ancestral names. <span id="fr_2811"></span>[2812](#fn_2811) Others,
again, affirm that he had his being from those twelve Æons who were the
offspring of Anthropos and Ecclesia; and on this account he acknowledges
himself the Son of man, as being a descendant of Anthropos. Others
still, assert that he was produced by Christ and the Holy Spirit, who
were brought forth for the security of the Pleroma; and that on this
account he was called Christ, thus preserving the appellation of the
Father, by whom he was produced. And there are yet others among them who
declare that the Propator of the whole, Proarche, and Proanennoetos is
called Anthropos; and that this is the great and abstruse mystery,
namely, that the Power which is above all others, and contains all in
his embrace, is termed Anthropos; hence does the Saviour style himself
the “Son of man.”

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2804"></span>[333:2805](0010709.htm#fr_2804) <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p1.3"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.xiii-p2"></span> We here follow the Greek as preserved
by Hippolytus (*Philosoph.*, vi. 38). The text followed by Epiphanius
(*Hær.*, xxxiii. 1) does not so well agree with the Latin.

<span id="fn_2805"></span>[333:2806](0010709.htm#fr_2805) <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p2.8"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.xiii-p3"></span> The text is here hopelessly corrupt;
but the general meaning seems to be that given above.

<span id="fn_2806"></span>[333:2807](0010709.htm#fr_2806) <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.xiii-p5"></span> This sentence exists only in the Latin
version, and we can give only a free translation.

<span id="fn_2807"></span>[333:2808](0010709.htm#fr_2807) <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.xiii-p6"></span> *Iliad*, ii. 1, etc.

<span id="fn_2808"></span>[333:2809](0010709.htm#fr_2808) <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.xiii-p7"></span> These words are found in *Epiphanius*,
but omitted in the old Latin version. The Latin gives “sense” instead of
“light.”

<span id="fn_2809"></span>[333:2810](0010709.htm#fr_2809) <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.xiii-p9"></span> The text is here very uncertain. Some
propose to read *six* Æons instead of *all*.

<span id="fn_2810"></span>[333:2811](0010709.htm#fr_2810) <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p9.3"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.xiii-p10"></span> Here again the text is corrupt and
obscure. We have followed what seems the most probable emendation.

<span id="fn_2811"></span>[334:2812](0010709.htm#fr_2811) <span
id="ix.ii.xiii-p11.3"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.xiii-p12"></span> Harvey justly remarks, that “one cause
of perplexity in unravelling the Valentinian scheme is the recurrence of
similar names at different points of the system, e.g., the Enthymesis of
Sophia was called Sophia and Spiritus; and Pater, Arche, Monogenes,
Christus, Anthropos, Ecclesia, were all of them terms of a double
denomination.”
