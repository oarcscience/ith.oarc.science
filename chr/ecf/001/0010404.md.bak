### <span id="viii.ii.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Of the Hebrew prophets.

<span id="viii.ii.xxxi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>There were, then, among the Jews certain
men who were prophets of God, through whom the prophetic Spirit
published beforehand things that were to come to pass, ere ever they
happened. And their prophecies, as they were spoken and when they were
uttered, the kings who happened to be reigning among the Jews at the
several times carefully preserved in their possession, when they had
been arranged in books by the prophets themselves in their own Hebrew
language. And when Ptolemy king of Egypt formed a library, and
endeavoured to collect the writings of all men, he heard also of these
prophets, and sent to Herod, who was at that time king of the
Jews, <span id="fr_1825"></span>[1826](#fn_1825.md) requesting that the
books of the prophets be sent to him. And Herod the king did indeed send
them, written, as they were, in the foresaid Hebrew language. And when
their contents were found to be unintelligible to the Egyptians, he
again sent and requested that men be commissioned to translate them into
the Greek language. And when this was done, the books remained with the
Egyptians, where they are until now. They are also in the possession of
all Jews throughout the world; but they, though they read, do not
understand what is said, but count us foes and enemies; and, like
yourselves, they kill and punish us whenever they have the power, as you
can well believe. For in the Jewish war which lately raged,
Barchochebas, the leader of the revolt of the Jews, gave orders that
Christians alone should be led to cruel punishments, unless they would
deny Jesus Christ and utter blasphemy. <span
id="viii.ii.xxxi-p2.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.xxxi-p2.2"></span>In
these books, then, of the prophets we found Jesus our Christ foretold as
coming, born of a virgin, growing up to man’s estate, and healing every
disease and every sickness, and raising the dead, and being hated, and
unrecognised, and crucified, and dying, and rising again, and ascending
into heaven, and being, and being called, the Son of God. We find it
also predicted that certain persons should be sent by Him into every
nation to publish these things, and that rather among the Gentiles
\[than among the Jews\] men should believe on Him. And He was predicted
before He appeared, first 5000 years before, and again 3000, then 2000,
then 1000, and yet again 800; for in the succession of generations
prophets after prophets arose.

<span id="viii.ii.xxxi-p2"></span> Some attribute this blunder in
chronology to Justin, others to his transcribers: it was Eleazer the
high priest to whom Ptolemy applied.
