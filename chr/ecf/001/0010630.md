### <span id="viii.vi.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Testimony of Plato.

<span id="viii.vi.xx-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi.xx-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xx-p1.2"></span>But Plato, though he accepted, as is likely,
the doctrine of Moses and the other prophets regarding one only God,
which he learned while in Egypt, yet fearing, on account of what had
befallen Socrates, lest he also should raise up some Anytus or Meletus
against himself, who should accuse him before the Athenians, and say,
“Plato is doing harm, and making himself mischievously busy, not
acknowledging the gods recognised by the state;” in fear of the
hemlock-juice, contrives an elaborate and ambiguous discourse concerning
the gods, furnishing by his treatise gods to those who wish them, and
none for those who are differently disposed, as may readily be seen from
his own statements. For when he has laid down that everything that is
made is mortal, he afterwards says that the gods were made. If, then, he
would have God and matter to be the origin of all things, manifestly it
is inevitably necessary to say that the gods were made of matter; but if
of matter, out of which he said that evil also had its origin, he leaves
right-thinking persons to consider what kind of beings the gods should
be thought who are produced out of matter. For, for this very reason did
he say that matter was eternal, <span
id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545.md) that he might not seem to say that
God is the creator of evil. And regarding the gods who were made by God,
there is no doubt he said this: “Gods of gods, of whom I am the
creator.” And he manifestly held the correct opinion concerning the
really existing God. For having heard in Egypt that God had said to
Moses, when He was about to send him to the Hebrews, “I am that I
am,” <span id="fr_2546"></span>[2547](#fn_2546.md) he understood that God
had not mentioned to him His own proper name.
