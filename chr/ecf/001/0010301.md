### <span id="v.xvii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Various exhortations and directions.

<span id="v.xvii.xiii-p1"></span>These things, brethren, out of the
affection which I entertain for you, I have felt compelled to write,
exhorting you with a view to the glory of God, not as if I were a person
of any consequence, but simply as a brother. Be ye subject to the
bishop, to the presbyters, and to the deacons. Love one another in the
Lord, as being the images of God. Take heed, ye husbands, that ye love
your wives as your own members. Ye wives also, love your husbands, as
being one with them in virtue of your union. If any one lives in
chastity or continence, let him not be lifted up, lest he lose his
reward. Do not lightly esteem the festivals. Despise not the period of
forty days, for it comprises an imitation of the conduct of the Lord.
After the week of the passion, do not neglect to fast on the fourth and
sixth days, distributing at the same time of thine abundance to the
poor. If any one fasts on the Lord’s Day or on the Sabbath, except on
the paschal Sabbath only, he is a murderer of Christ.
