<span id="viii.iv.lxxxi"></span>

### <span id="viii.iv.lxxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXXI.—He endeavours to prove this opinion from Isaiah and the Apocalypse.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxxi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxxi-p1.1"></span>“For Isaiah spake thus concerning this
space of a thousand years: ‘For there shall be the new heaven and the
new earth, and the former shall not be remembered, or come into their
heart; but they shall find joy and gladness in it, which things I
create. For, Behold, I make Jerusalem a rejoicing, and My people a joy;
and I shall rejoice over Jerusalem, and be glad over My people. And the
voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, or the voice of crying.
And there shall be no more there a person of immature years, or an old
man who shall not fulfil his days. <span
id="fr_2264"></span>[2265](#fn_2264) For the young man shall be an
hundred years old; <span id="fr_2265"></span>[2266](#fn_2265) but the
sinner who dies an hundred years old, <span
id="fr_2266"></span>[2267](#fn_2266) he shall be accursed. And they
shall build houses, and shall themselves inhabit them; and they shall
plant vines, and shall themselves eat the produce of them, and drink the
wine. They shall not build, and others inhabit; they shall not plant,
and others eat. For according to the days of the tree of life shall be
the days of my people; the works of their toil shall abound. <span
id="fr_2267"></span>[2268](#fn_2267) Mine elect shall not toil
fruitlessly, or beget children to be cursed; for they shall be a seed
righteous and blessed by the Lord, and their offspring with them. And it
shall come to pass, that before they call I will hear; while they are
still speaking, I shall say, What is it? Then shall the wolves and the
lambs feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the
serpent \[shall eat\] earth as bread. They shall not hurt or maltreat
each other on the holy mountain, saith the Lord.’ <span
id="fr_2268"></span>[2269](#fn_2268) Now we have understood that the
expression used among these words, ‘According to the days of the tree
\[of life <span id="fr_2269"></span>[2270](#fn_2269) \] shall be the
days of my people; the works of their toil shall abound’ obscurely
predicts a thousand years. For as Adam was told that in the day he ate
of the tree he would die, we know that he did not <span id="page_240">p.
240</span> <span id="viii.iv.lxxxi-Page_240"></span> complete a thousand
years. We have perceived, moreover, that the expression, ‘The day of the
Lord is as a thousand years,’ <span id="fr_2270"></span>[2271](#fn_2270)
is connected with this subject. And further, there was a certain man
with us, whose name was John, one of the apostles of Christ, who
prophesied, by a revelation that was made to him, that those who
believed in our Christ would dwell <span
id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271) a thousand years in Jerusalem; and
that thereafter the general, and, in short, the eternal resurrection and
judgment of all men would likewise take place. Just as our Lord also
said, ‘They shall neither marry nor be given in marriage, but shall be
equal to the angels, the children of the God of the resurrection.’ <span
id="fr_2272"></span>[2273](#fn_2272)
