### <span id="viii.iv.lxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXVI.—He proves from Isaiah that God was born from a virgin.

<span id="viii.iv.lxvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxvi-p1.1"></span>And I, resuming the discourse where I had
left off <span id="fr_2198"></span>[2199](#fn_2198.md) at a previous stage,
when proving that He was born of a virgin, and that His birth of a
virgin had been predicted by Isaiah, quoted again the same prophecy. It
is as follows ‘And the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying, Ask for thyself
a sign from the Lord thy God, in the depth or in the height. And Ahaz
said I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. And Isaiah said,
Hear then, O house of David; Is it no small thing for you to contend
with men? And how do you contend with the Lord? Therefore the Lord
Himself will give you a sign; Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and
shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel. Butter and
honey shall he eat; before he knows or prefers the evil he will choose
out the good. For before the child knows ill or good, he rejects evil by
choosing out the good. For before the child knows how to call father or
mother, he shall receive the power of Damascus, and the spoil of
Samaria, in presence of the king of Assyria. And the land shall be
forsaken, which <span id="fr_2199"></span>[2200](#fn_2199.md) thou shalt
with difficulty endure in consequence of the presence of its two kings.
But God shall bring on thee, and on thy people, and on the house of thy
father, days which have not yet come upon thee since the day in which
Ephraim took away from Judah the king of Assyria.’ ” <span
id="fr_2200"></span>[2201](#fn_2200.md) And I continued: “Now it is evident
to all, that in the race of Abraham according to the flesh no one has
been born of a virgin, or is said to have been born \[of a virgin\],
save this our Christ.”
