### <span id="iii.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The relation of Christians to the world.

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p1"></span><span id="iii.ii.vi-p1.1"></span><span
id="iii.ii.vi-p1.2"></span>To sum up all in one word— what the soul is
in the body, that are Christians in the world. The soul is dispersed
through all the members of the body, and Christians are scattered
through all the cities of the world. The soul dwells in the body, yet is
not of the body; and Christians dwell in the world, yet are not of the
world. <span id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) The invisible soul is
guarded by the visible body, and Christians are known indeed to be in
the world, but their godliness remains invisible. <span
id="iii.ii.vi-p2.2"></span>The flesh hates the soul, and wars against
it, <span id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) though itself suffering no
injury, because it is prevented from enjoying pleasures; the world also
hates the Christians, though in nowise injured, because they abjure
pleasures. The soul loves the flesh that hates it, and \[loves also\]
the members; Christians likewise love those that hate them. The soul is
imprisoned in the body, yet preserves <span
id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) that very body; and Christians are
confined in the world as in a prison, and yet they are the
preservers <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) of the world. The
immortal soul dwells in a mortal tabernacle; and Christians dwell as
sojourners in corruptible \[bodies\], looking for an incorruptible
dwelling <span id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) in the heavens. The
soul, when but ill-provided with food and drink, becomes better; in like
manner, the Christians, though subjected day by day to punishment,
increase the more in number. <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) God
has assigned them this illustrious position, which it were unlawful for
them to forsake.
