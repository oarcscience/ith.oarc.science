### <span id="viii.vi.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Testimony of Homer.

the poet Homer, using the license of poetry, and rivalling the original
opinion of Orpheus regarding the plurality of the gods, mentions,
indeed, several gods in a mythical style, lest he should seem to sing in
a different strain from the poem of Orpheus, which he so distinctly
proposed to rival, that even in the first line of his poem he indicated
the relation he held to him. For as Orpheus in the beginning of his poem
had said, “O goddess, sing the wrath of Demeter, who brings the goodly
fruit,” Homer began thus, “O goddess, sing the wrath of Achilles, son of
Peleus,” preferring, as it seems to me, even to violate the poetical
metre in his first line, than that he should seem not to have remembered
before all else the names of the gods. But shortly after he also clearly
and explicitly presents his own opinion regarding one God only,
somewhere <span id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542.md) saying to Achilles
by the mouth of Phœnix, “Not though God Himself were to promise that He
would peel off my old age, and give me the rigour of my youth,” where he
indicates by the pronoun the real and true God. And somewhere <span
id="fr_2543"></span>[2544](#fn_2543.md) he makes Ulysses address the host
of the Greeks thus: “The rule of many is not a good thing; let there be
one ruler.” And that the rule of many is not a good thing, but on the
contrary an evil, he proposed to evince by fact, recounting the wars
which took place on account of the multitude of rulers, and the fights
and factions, and their mutual counterplots. For monarchy *is* free from
contention. So far the poet Homer.
