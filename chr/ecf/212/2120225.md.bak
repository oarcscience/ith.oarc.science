<span id="ii.v.xlvii"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Sermon XCI.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xlvii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xlvii-p2.1"></span>On the Fast of the Seventh Month, VI.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xlvii-p3"></span>I.  *Abstinence must include discipline
of the soul as well as of the body.*

<span id="ii.v.xlvii-p4"></span>There is nothing, dearly-beloved, in
which the Divine Providence does not assist the devotions of the
faithful.  For the very elements of the world <span
id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209.md) also minister to the exercise of
mind and body in holiness, seeing that the distinctly varied revolution
of days and months opens for us the different pages of the commands, and
thus the seasons also in some sense speak to us of that which the sacred
institutions enjoin.  And hence, since the year’s course has brought
back the seventh month to us, I feel certain that your minds are
spiritually aroused to keep the solemn fast; since you have learnt by
experience how well this preparation purifies both the outer and the
inner parts of men, so that by abstaining from the lawful, resistance
becomes easier to the unlawful.  But do not limit your plan of
abstinence, dearly-beloved, to the mortifying of the body, or to the
lessening of food alone.  For the greater advantages of this virtue
belong to that chastity of the soul, which not only crushes the lusts of
the flesh, but also despises the vanities of worldly wisdom, as the
Apostle says, “take heed that no one deceive you through philosophy and
empty deceit, according to the tradition of men <span
id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210.md) .”

<span id="ii.v.xlvii-p7"></span>II.  *And in particular we must abstain
from heresy, and that of Eutyches as well as that of Nestorius.*

<span id="ii.v.xlvii-p8"></span>We must restrain ourselves, therefore,
from food, but much more must we fast from errors that the mind, given
up to no carnal pleasure, may be taken captive by no falsehood:  because
as in past days, so also in our own, there are not wanting enemies of
the Truth, who dare to stir up civil wars within the catholic
Church <span id="fr_1211"></span>[1212](#fn_1211.md) , in order that by
leading the ignorant into agreement with their ungodly doctrines they
may boast of increase in numbers through those whom they have been able
<span id="page_202">p. 202</span> <span
id="ii.v.xlvii-Page_202"></span>to sever from the Body of Christ.  For
what is so opposed to the Prophets, so repugnant to the Gospels, so at
variance with the Apostles’ teaching as to preach one single Nature in
the <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvii-p9.1"></span>Lord</span> Jesus
Christ born of Mary, and without respect to time co-eternal with the
Eternal Father?  If it is only man’s nature which is to be acknowledged,
where is the Godhead Which saves? if only <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlvii-p9.2"></span>God’s</span>, where is the humanity which is
saved?  But the catholic Faith, which withstands all errors, refutes
these blasphemies also at the same time, condemning Nestorius, who
divides the Divine from the human, and denouncing Eutyches, who
nullifies the human in the Divine; seeing that the Son of True <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvii-p9.3"></span>God</span>, Himself True
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvii-p9.4"></span>God</span>,
possessing unity and equality with the Father and with the Holy Ghost,
has vouchsafed likewise to be true Man, and after the Virgin Mother’s
conception was not separated from her flesh and child-bearing, so
uniting humanity to Himself as to remain immutably <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvii-p9.5"></span>God</span>; so imparting
Godhead to man as not to destroy but enhance him by glorification.  For
He, Who became “the form of a slave,” ceased not to be “the form of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvii-p9.6"></span>God</span>,” and He
is not one joined with the other, but One in Both, so that ever since
“the Word became Flesh” our faith is disturbed by no vicissitudes of
circumstance, but whether in the miracles of power, or in the
degradation of suffering, we believe Him to be both <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvii-p9.7"></span>God</span>, Who is Man, and
Man, Who is <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvii-p9.8"></span>God <span
id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212.md) </span>.

<span id="ii.v.xlvii-p11"></span>III.  *The truth of the incarnation is
proved both by the Eucharistic Feast and by the Divine institution of
almsgiving.*

<span id="ii.v.xlvii-p12"></span>Dearly-beloved, utter this confession
with all your heart and reject the wicked lies of heretics, that your
fasting and almsgiving may not be polluted by any contagion with error: 
for then is our offering of the sacrifice clean and our gifts of mercy
holy, when those who perform them understand that which they do.  For
when the <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvii-p12.1"></span>Lord</span>
says, “unless ye have eaten the flesh of the Son of Man, and drunk His
blood, ye will not have life in you <span
id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213.md) ,” you ought so to be partakers at
the Holy Table, as to have no doubt whatever concerning the reality of
Christ’s Body and Blood.  For that is taken in the mouth which is
believed in Faith, and it is vain for them to respond Amen <span
id="fr_1214"></span>[1215](#fn_1214.md) who dispute that which is taken. 
But when the Prophet says, “Blessed is he, who considereth the poor and
needy <span id="fr_1215"></span>[1216](#fn_1215.md) ,” he is the
praiseworthy distributor of clothes and food among the poor, who knows
he is clothing and feeding Christ in the poor:  for He Himself says, “as
long as ye have done it to one of My brethren, ye have done it to
Me <span id="fr_1216"></span>[1217](#fn_1216.md) .”  And so Christ is One,
True <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvii-p16.2"></span>God</span> and
True Man, rich in what is His own, poor in what is ours, receiving gifts
and distributing gifts, Partner with mortals, and the Quickener of the
dead, so that in the “name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in
heaven, of things on earth, and of things under the earth, and that
every tongue should confess that the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlvii-p16.3"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ is in the glory of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvii-p16.4"></span>God</span> the
Father <span id="fr_1217"></span>[1218](#fn_1217.md) ,” living and reigning
with the Holy Spirit for ever and ever.  Amen.
