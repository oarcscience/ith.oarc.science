<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.xlii-p4"></A>Gregory to Castorius, &amp;c.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xlii-p5"></A>The magnificent lord Andreas presses me continually about restoring the use of the pallium in the Church of Ravenna according to ancient custom.&#160; And thou knowest that the bishop John wrote to me that it had been the custom for the bishops of the said Church to use the pallium in solemn litanies&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1677"></A><A HREF="#fn_1677"><FONT SIZE="1">1678</FONT></A>
.&#160; Adeodatus, deacon of that church, when he besought me earnestly on the same subject, satisfied me by oath that the bishops of the said place were accustomed to use the pallium in litanies four times in the year.&#160; But the aforesaid lord Andreas says in his letters that the bishop of Ravenna was in the habit of using the pallium in litanies at all times except in Lent.&#160; And these litanies, which he does not blush to say were daily, he asserts to be solemn ones.&#160; Whence I have been altogether astonished.&#160; But let thy Experience regard no man&#146;s person, no man&#146;s words; keep the fear of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xlii-p6.1"></A>God</span> and rectitude only before thine eyes, and enquire of senior persons, and of the Archdeacon of that same Church, who would not, I think, perjure himself for the honour of another, and of others of older standing who had been in sacred orders before the times of bishop John, or if there are any others of riper age not in holy orders; and let them come before the body of Saint Apollinaris, and touching his sepulchre swear what had been the custom before the times of bishop John; since, as thou knowest, he was a man who presumed greatly and endeavoured in his pride to arrogate many things to himself.&#160; And whatever may be sworn to by faithful and grave men, according to the subjoined form, we desire to be retained in the same Church.&#160; But see that thou act not negligently, and that no one corrupt thy faithfulness and devotion in this matter; for thy zeal I know.&#160; Act assiduously, yet so that the aforesaid Church be not lowered in a way contrary to justice, but that it retain the usage that existed before the times of bishop John.&#160; Moreover, for satisfying thyself, do not enquire of two or three persons, but of as many as thou canst find of old standing and grave character, that so we may neither deny to that Church what has been of ancient custom, nor concede to it what has been coveted and attempted newly.&#160; But do all kindly and sweetly, so that both thy action may be strict and thy tongue gentle.&#160; The sword&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1678"></A><A HREF="#fn_1678"><FONT SIZE="1">1679</FONT></A>
 which has been left at Ravenna, as we have already written, bring hither with thee; and carefully attend to what our son Boniface the deacon and the magnificent Maurentius the <i>chartularius</i> have written to thee about.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xlii-p8"></A>I swear by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the inseparable Trinity of Divine Power, and by this body of the blessed martyr Apollinaris, that out of favour to no person, and without any advantage to myself intervening, I give my testimony.&#160; But this I know, and am personally cognizant of, that, before the times of the late bishop John, the Bishop of Ravenna, in the presence of this or that <i>apocrisiarius</i> of the Apostolic See, on such and such days, had the custom of using the pallium, and I am not aware that he had herein usurped latently, or in the absence of the <i>apocrisiarius.</i></p>
