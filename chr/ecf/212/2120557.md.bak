<span id="iii.v.vii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXIX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vii.xxv-p2"></span>To John, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xxv-p3"></span>Gregory to John, Bishop of Syracuse.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xxv-p4"></span>Lest attention to secular affairs
should disjoin the hearts of religious men (which <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xxv-p4.1"></span>God</span> forbid) from mutual charity,
very earnest endeavour should be made to bring any matter that has come
into dispute to the easiest possible termination.  Since, then, from the
information of Cæsarius, abbot of St. Peter’s monastery, constituted in
a place called Baias, we find that between him and John, abbot of St.
Lucia’s monastery, constituted in the city of Syracuse, there has arisen
a serious question about certain boundaries, we, lest this contention
should be prolonged between them, have taken thought for their dispute
being terminated by the determination of a land-measurer.  And
accordingly we have written to the *defensor* Fantinus, bidding him
direct John the land-measurer, who has gone from Rome to Panormus, to
resort to your Fraternity.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xxv-p5"></span>We exhort, therefore, that you go
with him to the places about which there is contention, and, both
parties having been brought together, cause the places in dispute to
have their boundaries defined in your presence, though still with a
claim of prescription for forty years preserved to either party.  But,
whatever may be determined, let it be your Fraternity’s anxious and
studious care to have it so observed that no strife may henceforth be
stirred up anew, nor any further complaint reach us.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xxv-p6"></span>We believe that it is not unknown to
your Fraternity that the venerable abbot Cæsarius was formerly our
friend; and therefore, saving equity, we commend him to you in all
respects.  And, seeing that he is entirely inexperienced in secular
causes, it is needful for him to be aided by your solicitude; yet so
that, in this as in all cases, you observe, as is fit, reason and
justice.
