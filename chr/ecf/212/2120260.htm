<p class="c30"><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p2"></A>What diversity there ought to be in the art of preaching.</p>  
<p class="c31"><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p3"></A>Differently to be admonished are these that follow:&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p4"></A>Men and women.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p5"></A>The poor and the rich.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p6"></A>The joyful and the sad.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p7"></A>Prelates and subordinates.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p8"></A>Servants and masters.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p9"></A>The wise of this world and the dull.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p10"></A>The impudent and the bashful.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p11"></A>The forward and the fainthearted.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p12"></A>The impatient and the patient.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p13"></A>The kindly disposed and the envious.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p14"></A>The simple and the insincere.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p15"></A>The whole and the sick.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p16"></A>Those who fear scourges, and therefore live innocently; and those who have grown so hard in iniquity as not to be corrected even by scourges.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p17"></A>The too silent, and those who spend time in much speaking.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p18"></A>The slothful and the hasty.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p19"></A>The meek and the passionate.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p20"></A>The humble and the haughty.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p21"></A>The obstinate and the fickle.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p22"></A>The gluttonous and the abstinent.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p23"></A>Those who mercifully give of their own, and those who would fain seize what belongs to others.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p24"></A>Those who neither seize the things of others nor are bountiful with their own; and those who both give away the things they have, and yet cease not to seize the things of others.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p25"></A>Those that are at variance, and those that are at peace.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p26"></A>Lovers of strifes and peacemakers.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p27"></A>Those that understand not aright the words of sacred law; and those who understand them indeed aright, but speak them without humility.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p28"></A>Those who, though able to preach worthily, are afraid through excessive humility; and those whom imperfection or age debars from preaching, and yet rashness impels to it.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p29"></A>Those who prosper in what they desire in temporal matters; and those who covet indeed the things that are of the world, and yet are wearied with the toils of adversity.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p30"></A>Those who are bound by wedlock, and those who are free from the ties of wedlock.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p31"></A>Those who have had experience of carnal intercourse, and those who are ignorant of it.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p32"></A>Those who deplore sins of deed, and those who deplore sins of thought.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p33"></A>Those who bewail misdeeds, yet forsake them not; and those who forsake them, yet bewail them not.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p34"></A>Those who even praise the unlawful things they do; and those who censure what is wrong, yet avoid it not.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p35"></A>Those who are overcome by sudden passion, and those who are bound in guilt of set purpose.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p36"></A>  <A NAME="page_25b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-Page_25b"></A>Those who, though their unlawful deeds are trivial, yet do them frequently; and those who keep themselves from small sins, but are occasionally whelmed in graver ones.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p37"></A>Those who do not even begin what is good, and those who fail entirely to complete the good begun.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p38"></A>Those who do evil secretly and good publicly; and those who conceal the good they do, and yet in some things done publicly allow evil to be thought of them.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p39"></A>But of what profit is it for us to run through all these things collected together in a list, unless we also set forth, with all possible brevity, the modes of admonition for each?</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p40"></A>(<i>Admonition</i> 1.)&#160; Differently, then, to be admonished are men and women; because on the former heavier injunctions, on the latter lighter are to be laid, that those may be exercised by great things, but these winningly converted by light ones.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p41"></A>(<i>Admonition</i> 2.)&#160; Differently to be admonished are young men and old; because for the most part severity of admonition directs the former to improvement, while kind remonstrance disposes the latter to better deeds.&#160; For it is written, <i>Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001">1 Tim. v. 1</a><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p41.1"></A>).&amp;gt;</p>
