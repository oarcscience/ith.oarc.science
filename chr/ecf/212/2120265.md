<span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p2"></span>How the wise and the dull are to be
admonished.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3"></span>(*Admonition* 7).  Differently to be
admonished are the wise of this world and the dull.  For the wise are to
be admonished that they leave off knowing what they know:  the dull also
are to be admonished that they seek to know what they know not.  In the
former this thing first, that they think themselves wise, is to be
thrown down; in the latter whatsoever is already known of heavenly
wisdom is to be built up; since, being in no wise proud, they have, as
it were, prepared their hearts for supporting a building.  With those we
should labour that they become more wisely foolish, leave foolish
wisdom, and learn the wise foolishness of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.1"></span>God</span>:  to these we should preach
that from what is accounted foolishness they should pass, as from a
nearer neighbourhood, to true wisdom.  For to the former it is said, *If
any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a
fool, that he may be wise* ([1 Cor. iii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.2"></span>):  but to the latter it is said, *Not
many wise men after the flesh* ([1 Cor. i.
26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.3"></span>); and again, *<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.4"></span>God</span> hath chosen the foolish things
of the world to confound the wise* ([1 Cor.
1.27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.5"></span>).  The former are for the most part
converted by arguments of reasoning; the latter sometimes better by
examples.  Those it doubtless profits to lie vanquished in their own
allegations; but for these it is sometimes enough to get knowledge of
the praiseworthy deeds of others.  Whence also the excellent teacher,
who was debtor to the wise and foolish ([Rom. i.
14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.6"></span>), when he was admonishing some of the
Hebrews that were wise, but some also that were somewhat slow, speaking
to them of the fulfilment of the Old Testament, overcame the wisdom of
the former by argument, saying, *That which decayeth and waxeth old is
ready to vanish away* ([Heb. viii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.7"></span>).  But, when he perceived that some were
to be drawn by examples only, he added in the same epistle, *Saints had
trial of mockings and scourgings, yea moreover of bonds and
imprisonment; they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted,
were slain with the sword* ([Heb.
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#036),
[37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.8"></span>):  and again, *Remember those who were
set over you, who spoke to you the Word of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.9"></span>God</span>, whose faith follow, looking
to the end of their conversation* ([Heb.
13.7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.10"></span>); that so victorious reason might
subdue the one sort, but the gentle force of example persuade the other
to mount to greater things.
