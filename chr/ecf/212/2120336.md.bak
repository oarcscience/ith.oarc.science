<span id="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p2"></span>To Theodorus, Duke of Sardinia.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p3"></span>Gregory to Theodorus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p4"></span>The justice which you bear in your
mind you ought to shew in the light of your deeds.  Now Juliana, abbess
of the monastery of Saint Vitus which Vitula of venerable memory had
once built, has intimated to us that possession of the aforesaid
monastery is claimed by Donatus, your official; who, seeing himself to
be fortified by your patronage, scorns to have resort to a judicial
examination of the case.  But now let your Glory enjoin this same
official, with the aforesaid hand-maiden of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p4.1"></span>God</span>, to submit the matter to
arbitration to the end that whatever may be decided as to the question
in dispute by the judgment of the arbitrators may be carried into
effect; so that, whatever he may find he has to lose or keep, what he
does may not be done as a deed of virtue, but set down to the justice of
the law.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p5"></span>Further, Pompeiana, a religious lady,
who is known to have established a monastery in her own house, has
complained that the mother of her deceased son-in-law wishes to annul
his will, to the end that her son’s last disposition of his property may
be made of none effect.  On this account we hold it necessary with
paternal charity to exhort your Glory to lend yourself willingly, with
due regard to justice, to pious causes, and kindly order that whatever
these persons have a rightful claim to be secured to them.  Now, we
beseech the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> to direct the way of your
life propitiously, and grant you a prosperous administration of your
dignified office.
