<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxv-p2"></A>To Columbus, Bishop.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxv-p3"></A>Gregory to Columbus, Bishop of Numidia.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1658"></A><A HREF="#fn_1658"><FONT SIZE="1">1659</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xxv-p5"></A>The letters of your Fraternity, full of priestly sweetness, we have received at the hands of Rogatianus the deacon, the bearer of these presents.&#160; And their kind expressions rejoiced us much, especially as we were informed through them of what we long to hear of, your welfare.&#160; But the devotion of your Holiness we have both known of old; and as you now write, so we hold it to be.&#160; For of what kind the sincerity of your Fraternity towards us is we need nothing to satisfy us, since we know it from the love of our own heart which encircles you.&#160; We have given to the above-named hearer, whom you commended to us by letter, writings addressed to the Rector of the patrimony of Sicily, bidding him urge the opposite party to do what is just, to the end that, idle excuses being put aside, the whole case in dispute may be speedily brought to an end.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xxv-p6"></A>We now inform your Holiness that a certain man has come to us, Peter by name, who asserted that he was a bishop, and requested from us a remedy of his complaint.&#160; And at first indeed he related things that might have been deserving of pity; but on enquiry we found things to be very different from what he told us, and his behaviour has exceedingly distressed us.&#160; But, inasmuch as, separated as we are by so great a distance, we could by no means learn thoroughly the gist of his case, we have been unable to determine it, being in doubt.&#160; But now, seeing that the aforesaid deacon, who is returning to you, has asked that this person should be allowed to go with him, and he himself has requested to be sent to you, both of them knowing that your Holiness has, as becomes you, zeal for the faith and a love of justice, the proposal has been acceptable to us, and we have granted what they asked.&#160; Since, then, you being on the spot can ascertain the merits of the case more thoroughly, we exhort you so to observe what is just and canonical towards the same Peter that both the requirements of rectitude may be fulfilled by you in all respects, and his case may be seen to have been judged after the fear of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxv-p6.1"></A>God</span> and the rules of the Church.&#160; But, if any one is said to have been privy to, or a partaker in, the things which the aforesaid Peter is accused of, accurate enquiry must be made, and, when the truth is known, judgment in like manner pronounced canonically.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xxv-p7"></A>Furthermore, a thing altogether hard to be borne, and hostile to the right faith, has come to our ears; namely that catholics (which is awful to be told) and religious persons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1659"></A><A HREF="#fn_1659"><FONT SIZE="1">1660</FONT></A>
 (which is worse) consent to their children and their slaves, or others whom they have in their  <A NAME="page_201b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 201b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.vi.xxv-Page_201b"></A>power, being baptized in the heresy of the Donatists.&#160; And so, if this is true, let your Fraternity study with all your power to correct it, to the end that the purity of the faith may through your solicitude stand inviolate, and innocent souls who might be saved by catholic baptism perish not from the infection of heretics.&#160; Whosoever, then, of the persons above mentioned has suffered any one belonging to him to be baptized among the Donatists, study with all your power, and with all urgency, to recall such to the catholic faith.&#160; But, if any one of such persons should under any pretext endure the doing of this thing in the case of such as are his in future, let him be cut off entirely from the communion of the clergy.</p>
