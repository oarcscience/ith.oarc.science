<span id="iii.v.iv.xxvi-p2"></span>To Pantaleo, Præfect.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxvi-p3"></span>Gregory to Pantaleo, Præfect of
Africa.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxvi-p4"></span>How the law urgently prosecutes the
most abominable pravity of heretics is not unknown to your
Excellency <span id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556.md) .  It is therefore
no light sin if these, whom both the integrity of our faith and the
strictness of the laws condemn, should find licence to creep up again in
your times.  Now in those parts, so far as we have learnt, the audacity
of the Donatists has so increased that not only do they with pestiferous
assumption of authority cast out of their churches priests of the
catholic faith, but fear not even to rebaptize those whom the water of
regeneration had cleansed on a true confession.  And we are much
surprised, if indeed it is so, that, while you are placed in those
parts, bad men should be allowed thus to exceed.  Consider only in the
first place what kind of judgment you will leave to be passed upon you
by men, if these, who in the times of others were with just reason put
down, find under your administration a way for their excesses.  In the
next place know that our <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxvi-p5.1"></span>God</span> will require at your hand the
souls of the lost, if you neglect to amend, so far as possibility
requires it of you, so great an abomination.  Let not your Excellency
take amiss my thus speaking.  For it is because we love you as our own
children that we point out to you what we doubt not will be to your
advantage.  But send to us with all speed our brother and fellow-bishop
Paul <span id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md) , <span
id="page_158b">p. 158b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iv.xxvi-Page_158b"></span>lest opportunity should be given to
any one under any excuse for hindering his coming; in order that, on
ascertaining the truth more fully, we may be able, with <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xxvi-p6.1"></span>God’s</span> help, to
settle by a reasonable treatment of the case how the punishment of so
great a crime ought to be proceeded with.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxvi-p5"></span> As to imperial edicts against the
African Donatists, see I. 74, note 8.  It would seem from this and the
following letter that enforcement of the laws for their repression had
been relaxed of late.  It will be observed from this and other instances
that Gregory, though often in general terms deprecating the use of force
in matters of faith, did not scruple, when occasion arose, to call in
the aid of the secular arm; and in this case with some heat and
acrimony.  Cf. IV. 35, below.

<span id="fn_1557"></span>[157b:1558](2120447.htm#fr_1557.md) <span
id="iii.v.iv.xxvi-p5.2"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxvi-p6"></span> This Paul was one of the bishops of
Numidia, against whom some charges of misconduct, not specified, had
been brought.  His case has some significance as shewing that, though
the spiritual authority of the bishop of Rome over the Church in Africa
had now come to be acknowledged in a way that it had not been in the age
of Cyprian, yet there seems to have been still some resistance to its
exercise.  This appears also from the fact that it was not the primate
of Numidia, but Columbus, a bishop notable for his devotion to the Roman
See, that Gregory mainly and most confidentially corresponded with in
relation to ecclesiastical affairs (see II. 48, note 1), and that this
Columbus complained of being in disfavour with many on the ground of the
frequent communications he received from Rome (VII. 2).  In the case
before us Gregory’s desire (urgently expressed in this letter to
Pantaleo, and in that which follows to the primate and Columbus,
jointly), that Paul should at once be sent to Rome for trial was not
complied with.  For two years later (VI. 63) Gregory complains of this,
and also expresses surprize that the accused bishop should have been
excommunicated by the African authorities, and no news sent thereof to
himself by the primate.  Then, in the following year (VII. 2), writing
to Columbus, he finds himself unable to refuse his assent to Paul’s
resorting to Constantinople to lay his case before the Emperor.  However
in the year after this it seems that he did go at length to Rome, but
not so as to have his case decided there:  for Gregory sends him back to
Africa to have his case inquired into, only enjoining Columbus, to whom
he writes, to do his utmost to see justice done, he himself believing
the accused to be innocent, and attributing the charges against him to
odium incurred by his measures against the Donatists.  The final issue
does not appear.  See also XII. 8.
