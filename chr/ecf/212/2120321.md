<span id="iii.v.i.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xix-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXVI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xix-p2"></span>To Anastasius, Patriarch of Antioch.

<span id="iii.v.i.xix-p3"></span>\[The beginning of this epistle is the
same as that of Epistle VII. to the same Anastasius as far as the words
“stand on the shore of virtue”; after which it is continued as
follows.\]

<span id="iii.v.i.xix-p4"></span>But, as to your calling me the mouth
and lantern of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xix-p4.1"></span>Lord</span>, and alleging that I profit
many by speaking, and am able to give light to many, I confess that you
have brought me into a state of the greatest doubt in my estimate of
myself.  For I consider what I am, and detect in myself no sign of all
this good.  But I consider also what you are, and I do not think that
you can lie.  When, then, I would believe what you say, my infirmity
contradicts me.  When I would dispute what is said in my praise, your
sanctity contradicts me.  But I pray you, holy man, let us come to some
agreement in this our contest, that, though it is not as you say, it may
be so because you say it.  Moreover, I have addressed my synodical
epistle to you, as to the other patriarchs, your brethren <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323.md) ; inasmuch as with me you are
always what it has been granted you to be by the gift of Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xix-p5.1"></span>God</span>, without regard
to what you are accounted not to be by the will of men <span
id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324.md) .  I have given some instructions
to Boniface the guardian (*defensori*), who is the bearer of these
presents, for him to communicate to your holiness in private.  Moreover,
I have sent you keys of the blessed apostle Peter, who loves you, which
are wont to shine forth with many miracles when placed on the bodies of
sick persons <span id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325.md) .

<span id="iii.v.i.xix-p5"></span> The Benedictine Editors adopt the
reading *patribus* instead of *fratribus*.  But the sense seems to
require the latter.

<span id="iii.v.i.xix-p7"></span> Keys of St. Peter’s sepulchre, in
which had been inserted filings from his alleged chains preserved at
Rome, were often sent by Gregory to distinguished friends (cf. III. 48;
VI. 6; VII. 26; VIII. 35; IX. 122; XI. 66), to be hung round the neck
(VI. 6) or deposited (XI. 66), or used for healing.  For an account of
how the filings were obtained, see IV. 30.  In one instance the key is
described as being of gold (VII. 26).  To Eulogius of Alexandria is sent
a small cross containing filings from the chains, to be applied to his
sore eyes.
