<p class="c26"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p2"></A><span class="c4"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p2.1"></A>To the Archimandrites of Constantinople&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_325"></A><A HREF="#fn_325"><FONT SIZE="1">326</FONT></A>
.</span></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p4"></A>To his well-beloved sons Faustus, Martinus, and the rest of the archimandrites, Leo the bishop.</p>  
<p class="c30"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p5"></A>He acknowledges their zeal and refers them to the Tome.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p6"></A>As on behalf of the faith which Eutyches has tried to disturb, I was sending legates <i>de latere</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_326"></A><A HREF="#fn_326"><FONT SIZE="1">327</FONT></A>
 to assist the defence of the Truth, I thought it fitting that I should address a letter to you also, beloved:&#160; whom I know for certain to be so zealous in the cause of religion that you can by no means listen calmly to such blasphemous and profane utterances:&#160; for the Apostle&#146;s command lingers in your hearts, in which it is said, &#8220;If any man hath preached unto you any gospel other than that which he received, let him be anathema&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_327"></A><A HREF="#fn_327"><FONT SIZE="1">328</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; And we also decide that the opinion of the said Eutyches is to be rejected, which, as we have learnt from perusing the proceedings, has been deservedly condemned:&#160; so that, if its foolish maintainer will abide by his perverseness, he may have fellowship with those whose error he has followed.&#160; For one who says that Christ had not a human, that is our, nature, is deservedly put out of Christ&#146;s Church.&#160; But, if he be corrected through the pity of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p8.2"></A>God&#146;s</span> Spirit and acknowledge his wicked error, so as to condemn unreservedly what catholics reject, we wish him not to be denied mercy, that the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p8.3"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> Church may suffer no loss:&#160; for the repentant can always be readmitted, it is only error that must be shut out.&#160; Upon the mystery of great godliness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_328"></A><A HREF="#fn_328"><FONT SIZE="1">329</FONT></A>
, whereby through the Incarnation of the Word of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p9.4"></A>God</span> comes our justification and redemption, what is our opinion, drawn from the tradition of the fathers, is now sufficiently explained according to my judgment in the letter which I have sent to our brother Flavian the bishop&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">330</FONT></A>
:&#160; so that through the declaration of your chief you may know what, according to the gospel of our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p10.1"></A>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, we desire to be fixed in the hearts of all the faithful.&#160; Dated 13th June, in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).</p>

Sardic., canon 7, where the fathers ask the Roman bishop to send some one <i>e latere suo</i> (<span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p7.1"></A>a.d.</span> 347).</p>
