<p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p1.1"></A>Epistle IX.</span></p>  
<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p2"></A>To Januarius, Bishop.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p3"></A>Gregory to Januarius, Bishop of Caralis (Cagliari).</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p4"></A>Pastoral zeal ought indeed in itself to have sufficiently instigated thee, even without our aid, to protect profitably and providently the flock of which thou hast taken charge, and to preserve it with diligent circumspection from the cunning devices of enemies.&#160; But, since we have found that thy Charity needs also the written word of our authority for the augmentation of thy firmness, it is necessary for us, by the exhortation of brotherly love, to strengthen thy faltering disposition towards the earnestness of religious activity.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p5"></A>Now it has come to our knowledge that thou art remiss in thy guardianship of the monasteries of the handmaidens of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p5.1"></A>God</span> situated in Sardinia; and, though it had been prudently arranged by thy predecessors that certain approved men of the clergy should have the charge of attending to their needs, this has now been so entirely neglected that women specially dedicated to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p5.2"></A>God</span> are compelled to go in person among public functionaries about tributes and other liabilities, and are under the necessity of running to and fro through villages and farms for making up their taxes, and of mixing themselves unsuitably in business which belongs to men.&#160; This evil let thy Fraternity remove by an easy correction; that is, by carefully deputing one man of approved life and manners, and of such age and position as to give rise to no evil suspicion of him, who may, with the fear of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p5.3"></A>God</span>, so assist the inmates of these monasteries that they may no longer be allowed to wander, against rule, for any cause whatever, private or public, beyond their venerable precincts; but that whatever has to be done in their behalf may be transacted reasonably by him whom you shall depute.&#160; But let the nuns themselves, rendering praises to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p5.4"></A>God</span> and confining themselves to their monasteries, no longer suggest any evil suspicion to the minds of the faithful.&#160; But if any one of them, either through former license, or through an evil custom of impunity, has  <A NAME="page_148b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 148b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.iv.ix-Page_148b"></A>been seduced, or should in future be led, into the gulph of adulterous lapse, we will that, after enduring the severity of adequate punishment, she be consigned for penance to some other stricter monastery of virgins, that she may there give herself to prayers and fastings, and profit herself by penitence, and afford an example of the more rigorous kind of discipline, such as may inspire fear in others.&#160; Further, let any one who may be detected in any iniquity with women of this class be deprived of communion, if he be a layman; but, if he be a cleric, let him also be removed from his office, and thrust into a monastery for his ever to be deplored excesses.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p6"></A>We also desire thee to hold councils of bishops twice in the year, as is said to have been the custom of thy province, as well as being ordered by the authority of the sacred canons; that, if any among them be of moral character inconsistent with his profession, he may be convicted by the friendly rebuke of his brethren, and also that measures may be taken with paternal circumspection for the security of the flock committed to him, and for the well-being of souls.&#160; It has come to our knowledge also that male and female slaves of Jews, who have fled for refuge to the Church on account of their faith, are either restored to their unbelieving masters, or paid for according to their value in lieu of being restored.&#160; We exhort therefore that thou by no means allow so bad a custom to continue; but that whosoever being a slave to Jews, shall have fled for refuge to venerable places, thou suffer him not in any degree to sustain prejudice.&#160; But, whether he had been a Christian before, or been baptized now, let him be supported in his claim for freedom, without any loss to the poor, by the patronage of ecclesiastical compassion.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p7"></A>Let not bishops presume to sign baptized infants a second time on the forehead with chrism; but let the presbyters anoint those who are to be baptized on the breast, that the bishops may afterwards anoint them on the forehead&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1530"></A><A HREF="#fn_1530"><FONT SIZE="1">1531</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p9"></A>With regard also to founding monasteries, which divers persons have ordered to be built, if thou perceivest that any persons to whom the charge has been assigned put it off on unjust pretexts, we desire thee to insist sagaciously according to what the laws enjoin, lest (as <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p9.1"></A>God</span> forbid should be the case) the pious retentions of the departed should be frustrated through thy neglect.&#160; Further, as to the monastery which Peter is said to have formerly ordered to be constructed in his house, we have seen fit that thy Fraternity should make accurate enquiry into the amount of the revenues there.&#160; And in case of there being a suitable provision, when all diminutions of the property and what is said to have been dispersed have been recovered, let the monastery with all diligence and without any delay be founded.&#160; But, if the means are insufficient or detrimental&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1531"></A><A HREF="#fn_1531"><FONT SIZE="1">1532</FONT></A>
, we desire thee, after closely investigating everything as has been commanded, to send a report to us, that we may know how to deliberate with the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.ix-p10.1"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> help with regard to its construction.&#160; Let, then, thy Fraternity give wise attention to all the points above referred to, so as neither to be found to have transgressed the tenour of our admonitions nor to stand liable to divine judgment for too little zeal in thy pastoral office.</p>
