<span id="ii.v.xxviii"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Sermon LV.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xxviii-p2.1"></span>On the Lord’s Passion IV., delivered on
Wednesday in Holy Week.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p3"></span>I.  *The difference between the
penitence and blasphemy of the two robbers is a type of the human race.*

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p4"></span>That which we owe to your expectations,
dearly-beloved, must be paid through the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxviii-p4.1"></span>Lord’s</span> bountiful answer to your
prayers that He Who has made you eager in the demanding would make us
fit for the performing.

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p5"></span>In speaking but lately of the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxviii-p5.1"></span>Lord’s</span> Passion we
reached the point in the Gospel story, where Pilate is said to have
yielded to the Jews’ wicked shouts that Jesus should be crucified.  And
so when all things had been accomplished, which the Godhead veiled in
frail flesh <span id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985.md) permitted, Jesus
Christ the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxviii-p6.1"></span>God</span> was fixed to the cross which He
had also been carrying, two robbers being similarly crucified, one on
His right hand, and the other on the left:  so that even in the
incidents of the cross might be displayed that difference which in His
judgment must be made in the case of all men; for the believing robber’s
faith was a type of those who are to be saved, and the blasphemer’s
wickedness prefigured those who are to be damned.  Christ’s Passion,
therefore, contains the mystery of our salvation, and of the instrument
which the iniquity of the Jews prepared for His punishment, the
Redeemer’s power has made for us the stepping-stone to glory <span
id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986.md) :  and that Passion the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxviii-p7.2"></span>Lord</span> Jesus so
underwent for the salvation of all men that, while hanging there nailed
to the wood, He entreated the Father’s mercy for His murderers, and
said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do <span
id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987.md) .”

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p9"></span>II.  *The chief priests showed utter
ignorance of Scripture in their taunts.*

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p10"></span>But the chief priests, for whom the
Saviour sought forgiveness, rendered the torture of the cross yet worse
by the barbs of railery; and at Him, on Whom they could vent no more
fury with their hands, they hurled the weapons of their tongues, saying,
“He saved others; Himself he cannot save.  If He is the King of Israel,
let Him now come down from the cross, and we believe Him <span
id="fr_988"></span>[989](#fn_988.md) .”  From what spring of error, from
what pool of hatred, O ye Jews, do ye drink such poisonous blasphemies? 
What master informed you, what teaching convinced you that you ought to
believe Him to be King of Israel and Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxviii-p11.2"></span>God</span>, who should either not allow
Himself to be crucified, or should shake Himself free from the binding
nails.  The mysteries of the Law, the sacred observances of the
Passover, the mouths of the Prophets never told you this:  whereas you
did find truly and oft-times written that which applies to your
abominable wicked-doing and to the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxviii-p11.3"></span>Lord’s</span> voluntary suffering.  For He
Himself says by Isaiah, “I gave My back to the scourges, My cheeks to
the palms of the hand, I turned not My face from the shame of
spitting <span id="fr_989"></span>[990](#fn_989.md) .”  He Himself says by
David, “They gave Me gall for My food, and in My thirst they supplied Me
with vinegar <span id="fr_990"></span>[991](#fn_990.md) ,” and again, “Many
dogs came about Me, the council of evil-doers beset Me.  They pierced My
hands and My feet, they counted all My bones.  But they themselves
watched and gazed on Me, they parted My raiment among them, and for My
robe they cast lots <span id="fr_991"></span>[992](#fn_991.md) .”  And lest
the course of your own evil doings should seem to have been foretold,
and no power in the Crucified predicted, ye read not, indeed, that the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxviii-p14.2"></span>Lord</span>
descended from the cross, but ye did read, “The <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxviii-p14.3"></span>Lord</span> reigned on the tree <span
id="fr_992"></span>[993](#fn_992.md) .”

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p16"></span>III.  *The triumph of the Cross is
immediate and effective.*

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p17"></span>The Cross of Christ, therefore,
symbolizes <span id="fr_993"></span>[994](#fn_993.md) the true altar of
prophecy, on which the oblation of man’s nature should be celebrated by
<span id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span
id="ii.v.xxviii-Page_168"></span>means of a salvation-bringing Victim. 
There the blood of the spotless Lamb blotted out the consequences of the
ancient trespass:  there the whole tyranny of the devil’s hatred was
crushed, and humiliation triumphed gloriously over the lifting up of
pride:  for so swift was the effect of Faith that of the robbers
crucified with Christ, the one who believed in Christ as the Son of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxviii-p18.1"></span>God</span> entered
paradise justified.  Who can unfold the mystery of so great a boon? who
can state the power of so wondrous a change?  In a moment of time the
guilt of long evil-doing is done away; clinging to the cross, amid the
cruel tortures of his struggling soul, he passes over to Christ; and to
him, on whom his own wickedness had brought punishment, Christ’s grace
now gives a crown.

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p19"></span>IV.  *When the last act in the tragedy
was over how must the Jews have felt?*

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p20"></span>And then, having now tasted the
vinegar, the produce of that vineyard which had degenerated in spite of
its Divine Planter, and had turned to the sourness of a foreign
vine <span id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994.md) , the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxviii-p21.2"></span>Lord</span> says, “it is
finished;” that is, the Scriptures are fulfilled:  there is no more for
Me to abide from the fury of the raging people:  I have endured all that
I foretold I should suffer.  The mysteries of weakness are completed,
let the proofs of power be produced.  And so He bowed the head and
yielded up His Spirit and gave that Body, Which should be raised again
on the third day, the rest of peaceful slumber.  And when the Author of
Life was undergoing this mysterious phase, and at so great a
condescension of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxviii-p21.3"></span>God’s</span> Majesty, the foundations of
the whole world were shaken, when all creation condemned their wicked
crime by its upheaval, and the very elements of the world delivered a
plain verdict against the criminals, what thoughts, what
heart-searchings had ye, O Jews, when the judgment of the universe went
against you, and your wickedness could not be recalled, the crime having
been done? what confusion covered you? what torment seized your hearts?

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p22"></span>V.  *Chastity and charity are the two
things most needful in preparing for Easter Communion.*

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p23"></span>Seeing therefore, dearly-beloved, that
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxviii-p23.1"></span>God’s</span> Mercy
is so great, that He has deigned to justify by faith many even from
among such a nation, and had adopted into the company of the patriarchs
and into the number of the chosen people us who were once perishing in
the deep darkness of our old ignorance, let us mount to the summit of
our hopes not sluggishly nor in sloth; but prudently and faithfully
reflecting from what captivity and from how miserable a bondage, with
what ransom we were purchased, by how strong an arm led out, let us
glorify <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxviii-p23.2"></span>God</span>
in our body:  that we may show Him dwelling in us, even by the
uprightness of our manner of life.  And because no virtues are worthier
or more excellent than merciful loving-kindness and unblemished
chastity, let us more especially equip ourselves with these weapons, so
that, raised from the earth, as it were on the two wings of active
charity and shining purity, we may win a place in heaven.  And
whosoever, aided by <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxviii-p23.3"></span>God’s</span> grace, is filled with this
desire and glories not in himself, but in the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxviii-p23.4"></span>Lord</span>, over his progress, pays due
honour to the Easter mystery.  His threshold the angel of destruction
does not cross, for it is marked with the Lamb’s blood and the sign of
the cross <span id="fr_995"></span>[996](#fn_995.md) .  He fears not the
plagues of Egypt, and leaves his foes overwhelmed by the same waters by
which he himself was saved.  And so, dearly-beloved, with minds and
bodies purified let us embrace the wondrous mystery of our salvation,
and, cleansed from all “the leaven of our old wickedness, let us
keep <span id="fr_996"></span>[997](#fn_996.md) ” the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxviii-p25.2"></span>Lord’s</span> Passover
with due observance:  so that, the Holy Spirit guiding us, we may be
“separated” by no temptations “from the love of Christ <span
id="fr_997"></span>[998](#fn_997.md) ,” Who bringing peace by His blood to
all things, has returned to the loftiness of the Father’s glory, and yet
not forsaken the lowliness of those who serve Him to Whom is the honour
and the glory for ever and ever.  Amen.

<span id="ii.v.xxviii-p6"></span> *Divinitas carnis velamine

English without a danger of being misunderstood.

Quesnel’s reading *gaudium*, though well supported by the <span
