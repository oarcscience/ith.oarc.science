<span id="ii.v.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Sermon XVI.</span>

<span id="ii.v.vii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p2.1"></span>On the Fast of the Tenth Month.</span>

<span id="ii.v.vii-p3"></span>I.  *The prosperous must show forth their
thankfulness to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p3.1"></span>God</span>, by liberality to the poor and
needy.*

<span id="ii.v.vii-p4"></span>The transcendent power of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vii-p4.1"></span>God’s</span> grace, dearly
beloved, is indeed daily effecting in Christian hearts the transference
of our every desire from earthly to heavenly things.  But this present
life also is passed through the Creator’s aid and sustained by His
providence, because He who promises things eternal is also the Supplier
of things temporal.  As therefore we ought to give <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vii-p4.2"></span>God</span> thanks for the
hope of future happiness towards which we run by faith, because He
raises us up to a perception of the happiness in store for us, so for
those things also which we receive in the course of every year, <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vii-p4.3"></span>God</span> should be honoured
and praised, who having from the beginning given fertility to the earth
and laid down laws of bearing fruit for every germ and seed, will never
forsake his own decrees but will as Creator ever continue His kind
administration of the things that He has made.  Whatever therefore the
cornfields, the vineyards and the olive groves have borne for man’s
purposes, all this <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p4.4"></span>God</span> in His bounteous goodness has
produced:  for under the varying condition of the elements He has
mercifully aided the uncertain toils of the husbandmen so that wind, and
rain, cold and heat, day and night might serve our needs.  For men’s
methods would not have sufficed to give effect to their works, had not
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vii-p4.5"></span>God</span> given the
increase to their wonted plantings and waterings.  And hence it is but
godly and just that we too should help others with that which the
Heavenly Father has mercifully bestowed on us.  For there are full many,
who have no fields, no vineyards, no olive-groves, whose wants we must
provide out of the store which <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p4.6"></span>God</span> has given, that they too with us
may bless <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vii-p4.7"></span>God</span>
for the richness of the earth and rejoice at its possessors having
received things which they have shared also with the poor and the
stranger.  That garner <span id="page_124">p. 124</span> <span
id="ii.v.vii-Page_124"></span>is blessed and most worthy that all fruits
should increase manifold in it, from which the hunger of the needy and
the weak is satisfied from which the wants of the stranger are relieved,
from which the desire of the sick is gratified.  For these men <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vii-p4.8"></span>God</span> has in His justice
permitted to be afflicted with divers troubles, that He might both crown
the wretched for their patience and the merciful for their
loving-kindness.

<span id="ii.v.vii-p5"></span>II.  *Almsgiving and fasting are the most
essential aids to prayer.*

<span id="ii.v.vii-p6"></span>And while all seasons are opportune for
this duty, beloved, yet this present season is specially suitable and
appropriate, at which our holy fathers, being Divinely inspired,
sanctioned the Fast of the tenth month, that when all the ingathering of
the crops was complete, we might dedicate to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p6.1"></span>God</span> our reasonable service of
abstinence, and each might remember so to use his abundance as to be
more abstinent in himself and more open-handed towards the poor.  For
forgiveness of sins is most efficaciously prayed for with almsgiving and
fasting, and supplications that are winged by such aids mount swiftly to
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vii-p6.2"></span>God’s</span> ears: 
since as it is written, “the merciful man doeth good to his own
soul <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) ,” and nothing is so much a
man’s own as that which he spends on his neighbour.  For that part of
his material possessions with which he ministers to the needy, is
transformed into eternal riches, and such wealth is begotten of this
bountifulness as can never be diminished or in any way destroyed, for
“blessed are the merciful, for <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p7.2"></span>God</span> shall have mercy on them <span
id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) ,” and He Himself shall be their chief
Reward, who is the Model of His own command.

<span id="ii.v.vii-p9"></span>III.  *Christians’ pious activity has so
enraged Satan that he has multiplied heresies to wreak them harm.*

<span id="ii.v.vii-p10"></span>But at all these acts of godliness,
dearly-beloved, which commend us more and more to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p10.1"></span>God</span>, there is no doubt that our enemy,
who is so eager and so skilled in harming us, is aroused with keener
stings of hatred, that under a false profession of the Christian name he
may corrupt those whom he is not allowed to attack with open and bloody
persecutions, and for this work he has heretics in his service whom he
has led astray from the catholic Faith, subjected to himself, and forced
under divers errors to serve in his camp.  And as for the deception of
primitive man he used the services of a serpent, so to mislead the minds
of the upright he has armed these men’s tongues with the poison of his
falsehoods.  But these treacherous designs, dearly beloved, with a
shepherd’s care, and so far as the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p10.2"></span>Lord</span> vouchsafes His aid, we will
defeat.  And taking heed lest any of the holy flock should perish, we
admonish you with fatherly warnings to keep aloof from the “lying lips”
and the “deceitful tongue” from which the prophet asks that his soul
should be delivered <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) ; because
“their words,” as says the blessed Apostle, “do creep as doth a
gangrene <span id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md) .”  They creep in
humbly, they arrest softly, they bind gently, they slay secretly.  For
they “come,” as the Saviour foretold, “in sheeps’ clothing, but inwardly
they are ravening wolves <span id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md) ;”
because they could not deceive the true and simple sheep, unless they
covered their bestial rage with the name of Christ.  But in them all he
is at work who, though he is really the enemy of enlightenment,
“transforms himself into an angel of light <span
id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md) .”  His is the craft which inspires
Basilides; his the ingenuity which worked in Marcion; he is the leader
under whom Sabellius acted; he the author of Photinus’ headlong fall,
his the authority and his the spirit which Arius and Eunomius served: 
in fine under his command and authority the whole herd of such wild
beasts has separated from the unity of the Church and severed connexion
with the Truth.

<span id="ii.v.vii-p15"></span>IV.  *Of all heresies Manicheism is the
worst and foullest.*

<span id="ii.v.vii-p16"></span>But while he retains this ever-varying
supremacy over all the heresies, yet he has built his citadel upon the
madness of the Manichees, and found in them the most spacious court in
which to strut and boast himself:  for there he possesses not one form
of misbelief only, but a general compound of all errors and
ungodlinesses.  For all that is idolatrous in the heathen, all that is
blind in carnal Jews, all that is unlawful in the secrets of the magic
art, all finally that is profane and blasphemous in all the heresies is
gathered together with all manner of filth in these men as if in a
cesspool <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704.md) .  And hence it is too
long a matter to describe all their ungodlinesses:  for the number of
the charges against them exceeds my supply of words.  It will be
sufficient to indicate a few instances, that you may, from what you
hear, conjecture what from modesty we omit.  In the matter of their
rites, however, which are as indecent morally as they are religiously,
we cannot keep <span id="page_125">p. 125</span> <span
id="ii.v.vii-Page_125"></span>silence about that which the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vii-p17.1"></span>Lord</span> has been pleased
to reveal to our inquiries, lest any one should think we have trusted in
this thing to vague rumours and uncertain opinions.  And so with bishops
and presbyters sitting beside me, and Christian nobles assembled in the
same place, we ordered their elect men and women to be brought before
us.  And when they had made many disclosures concerning their perverse
tenets and their mode of conducting festivals, they revealed this story
of utter depravity also, which I blush to describe but which has been so
carefully investigated that no grounds for doubt are left for the
incredulous or for cavillers.  For there were present all the persons by
which the unutterable crime had been perpetrated, to wit a girl at most
ten years old, and two women who had nursed her and prepared her for
this outrage.  There was also present the stripling who had outraged
her, and the bishop, who had arranged their horrible crime.  All these
made one and the same confession, and a tale of such foul orgies <span
id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md) was disclosed as our ears could
scarcely bear.  And lest by plainer speaking we offend chaste ears, the
account of the proceedings shall suffice, in which it is most fully
shown that in that sect no modesty, no sense of honour, no chastity
whatever is found:  for their law is falsehood, their religion the
devil, their sacrifice immorality.

<span id="ii.v.vii-p19"></span>V.  *Every one should abjure such men,
and give all the information they possess about them to the
authorities.*

<span id="ii.v.vii-p20"></span>And so, dearly beloved, renounce all
friendship with these men who are utterly abominable and pestilential,
and whom disturbances in other districts have brought in great numbers
to the city <span id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md) :  and you women
especially refrain from acquaintance and intercourse with such men, lest
while your ears are charmed unawares by their fabulous stories, you fall
into the devil’s noose, who, knowing that he seduced the first man by
the woman’s mouth, and drove all men from the bliss of paradise through
feminine credulity, still lies in watch for your sex with more confident
craft that he may rob both of their faith and of their modesty those
whom he has been able to ensnare by the servants of his falseness. 
This, too, dearly beloved, I entreat and admonish you loyally to inform
us <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md) , if any of you know where
they dwell, where they teach, whose houses they frequent, and in whose
company they take rest:  because it is of little avail to any one that
through the Holy Ghost’s protection he is not caught by them himself, if
he takes no action when he knows that others are being caught.  Against
common enemies for the common safety all alike should exercise the same
vigilance lest from one member’s wound other members also be injured,
and they that think such men should not be given up, in Christ’s
judgment be found guilty for their silence even though they are not
contaminated by their approval.

<span id="ii.v.vii-p23"></span>VI.  *Zeal in rooting out heresy will
make other pious duties more acceptable.*

<span id="ii.v.vii-p24"></span>Display then a holy zeal of religious
vigilance, and let all the faithful rise in one body against these
savage enemies of their souls.  For the merciful <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p24.1"></span>God</span> has delivered a certain portion of
our noxious foes into our hands in order that by revelation of the
danger the utmost caution might be aroused.  Let not what has been done
suffice, but let us persevere in searching them out:  and by <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vii-p24.2"></span>God’s</span> aid the result
will be not only the continuance in safety of those who still stand, but
also the recovery from error of many who have been deceived by the
devil’s seduction.  And the prayers, and alms, and fasts that you offer
to the merciful <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p24.3"></span>God</span> shall be the holier for this very
devotion, when this deed of faith also is added to all your other godly
duties.  On Wednesday and Friday, therefore, let us fast, and on
Saturday let us keep vigil in the presence of the most blessed Apostle
Peter; who, as we experience and know, watches unceasingly like a
shepherd over the sheep entrusted to him by the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p24.4"></span>Lord</span>, and who will prevail in his
entreaties that the Church of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vii-p24.5"></span>God</span>, which was founded by his
preaching, may be free from all error, through Christ our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vii-p24.6"></span>Lord</span>.  Amen.
