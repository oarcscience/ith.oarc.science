<span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxx-p1.1"></span>Epistle LVII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p2"></span>To John, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p3"></span>Gregory to John, Bishop of the
Corinthians

<span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p4"></span>Now that our <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxx-p4.1"></span>God</span>, from whom nothing is hidden,
having cast out an atrocious plague of pollution from the government of
His Church <span id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md) , <span
id="page_186b">p. 186b</span> <span
id="iii.v.v.xxx-Page_186b"></span>has been pleased to advance you to the
rule thereof, there is need of anxious precaution on your part that the
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p5.1"></span>Lord’s</span> flock,
after the wounds and various evils inflicted by its former shepherd, may
find consolation and wholesome medicine in your Fraternity.  Thus, then,
let the hand of your action wipe away the stain of the previous
contagion, so as to suffer no traces even to remain of that execrable
wickedness.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p6"></span>Let, therefore, your solicitude towards
your subjects be worthy of praise.  Let discipline be exhibited with
gentleness.  Let rebuke be with discernment.  Let kindness mitigate
wrath; let zeal sharpen kindness:  and let one be so seasoned with the
other that neither immoderate punishment afflict more than it ought, nor
again laxity impair the rectitude of discipline.  Let the conduct of
your Fraternity be a lesson to the people committed to you.  Let them
see in you what to love, and perceive what to make haste to imitate. 
Let them be taught how to live by your example.  Let them not deviate
from the straight course through your leading; let them find their way
to <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p6.1"></span>God</span> by
following you; that so thou mayest receive as many rewards from the
Saviour of the human race as thou shalt have won souls for Him.  Labour
therefore, most dear brother, and so direct the whole activity of thy
heart and soul, that thou mayest hereafter be counted worthy to hear,
*Well done, thou good and faithful servant:  enter thou into the joy of
thy <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p6.2"></span>Lord</span>*
([Matth. xxv. 21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xxx-p6.3"></span>).

<span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p7"></span>As you requested in your letter which
we received through our brother and fellow-bishop Andrew, we have sent
you the pallium, which it is necessary that you should so use as your
predecessors, by the allowance of our predecessors, are proved to have
used it.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p8"></span>Furthermore, it has come to our ears
that in those parts no one attains to any sacred order without the
giving of a consideration.  If this, is so, I say with tears, I declare
with groans, that, when the priestly order has fallen inwardly, neither
will it stand long outwardly.  For we know from the Gospel what our
Redeemer in person did; how He went into the temple, and overthrew the
seats of them that sold doves ([Matth. xxi.
12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xxx-p8.1"></span>).  For to sell doves is to receive a
temporal consideration for the Holy Spirit, whom, being consubstantial
with Himself, Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxx-p8.2"></span>God</span> gives to men through imposition
of hands.  And what follows from this evil, as I have said before, is
intimated; for the seats of those who presumed to sell doves in the
temple of <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p8.3"></span>God</span>
fell by the judgment of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxx-p8.4"></span>God</span>.  And in truth this
transgression is propagated with increase among subordinates.  For one
who attains to a sacred dignity tainted in the very root of his
promotion is himself the more prepared to sell to others what he has
bought.  And where then is that which is written, *Freely ye have
received; freely give* ([Matth. x.
8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xxx-p8.5"></span>)?  And, since the simoniacal heresy was
the first to arise against holy Church, why is it not considered, why is
it not seen, that whosoever ordains any one for a price in promoting him
causes him to become a heretic?  Seeing, then, that the holy universal
Church utterly condemns this most atrocious wickedness, we exhort your
Fraternity in all ways to repress, with all the urgency of your
solicitude, this so detestable and so huge a sin in all places that are
under you.  For, if we shall perceive anything of the kind to be done
henceforth, we will correct it, not with words, but with canonical
punishment; and we shall begin to have a different opinion of you; which
ought not so to be.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p9"></span>Further, your Fraternity knows that
formerly the pallium was not given except for a consideration received. 
But, since this was incongruous, we held a council before the body of
the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, and forbade under a strict
interdiction the receiving of anything, as well for this as for
ordinations.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p10"></span>It is your duty then, that neither for
a consideration, nor for favour or the solicitation of certain persons,
you consent to any persons being advanced to sacred orders.  For it is a
grave sin, as we have said, and we cannot suffer it to continue without
reproof.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxx-p11"></span>I delayed receiving the above named
Andrew, our brother and fellow-bishop, because by the report of our
brother and fellow-bishop Secundinus we learnt that he had forged
letters, as to himself from us, in the proceedings against John of
Larissa <span id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md) .  And, unless your
goodness had induced us, we would on no account have received him. 
Given the 15th day of the month of August, Indiction 13.
