<span id="iii.v.vi.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxix-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxix-p2"></span>To Urbicus, Abbot.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxix-p3"></span>Gregory to Urbicus, Abbot of Saint
Hermes, which is situated in Panormus.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxix-p4"></span>Whosoever, incited by divine
inspiration, hastens to leave the employments of this world and to be
converted to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxix-p4.1"></span>God</span> should so be received with
charity, and refreshed in all ways with kind consolations, that, by the
help of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxix-p4.2"></span>God</span>, he may delight in all ways to
persevere in the state of life which he has chosen.  Since, then,
Agatho, the bearer of these presents, desires to be converted <span
id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663.md) in thy Love’s monastery, we exhort
thee to receive him with all sweetness and love, and by assiduous
exhortation kindle his longing for eternal life, and study to be
diligently solicitous for his soul’s salvation; to the end that, while
by thy admonition he shall persist with devoted mind in the service of
our <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.xxix-p5.1"></span>God</span>, it
may both profit him to have left the world, and his conversion may be to
the increase of thine own reward.  Know, however, that he is to be so
received only if his wife also should wish to be similarly converted. 
For, when the bodies of both have been made one by the tie of wedlock,
it is unseemly that part should be converted and part remain in the
world <span id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664.md) .
