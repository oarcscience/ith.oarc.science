<span id="ii.iv.cxviii"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXIV.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p2.1"></span>To the Monks of Palestine.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p3"></span>Leo, the bishop, to the whole body of
monks settled throughout Palestine.

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p4"></span>I.  *They have possibly been misled by
a wrong translation of his letter on the Incarnation to Flavian.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p5"></span>The anxious care, which I owe to the
whole Church and to all its sons, has ascertained from many sources that
some offence has been given to your minds, beloved, through my
interpreters <span id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) , who being either
ignorant, as it appears, or malicious, have made you take some of my
statements in a different sense to what I meant, not being capable of
turning the Latin into Greek with proper accuracy, although in the
explanation of subtle and difficult matters, one who undertakes to
discuss them can scarcely satisfy himself even in his own tongue.  And
yet this has so far been of advantage to me, that by your disapproving
of what the catholic Faith rejects, we know you are greater friends to
the true than to the false:  and that you quite properly refuse to
believe what I myself also abhor, in accordance with ancient
doctrine <span id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) .  For although my
letter addressed to bishop Flavian, of holy memory, is of itself
sufficiently explicit, and stands in no need either of correction or
explanation, yet other of my writings harmonize with that letter, and in
them my position will be found similarly set forth.  For necessity was
laid upon me to argue against the heretics who have thrown many of
Christ’s peoples into confusion, both before our most merciful princes
and the holy synodal Council, and the church of Constantinople, and thus
I have laid down what we ought to think and feel on the Incarnation of
the Word according to the teaching of the Gospel and Apostles, and in
nothing have I departed from the creed of the holy Fathers:  because the
Faith is one, true, unique, catholic, and to it nothing can be added,
nothing taken away:  though Nestorius first, and now Eutyches, have
endeavoured to assail it from an opposite standpoint, but with similar
disloyalty, and have tried to impose on the Church of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p7.1"></span>God</span> two
contradictory heresies, which has led to their both being deservedly
condemned by the disciples of the Truth; because the false view which
they both held in different ways was exceedingly mad and sacrilegious.

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p8"></span>II.  *Eutyches, who confounds the
persons, is as much to be rejected as Nestorius, who separates
them* <span id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md) .

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p10"></span>Nestorius, therefore, must be
anathematized for believing the Blessed Virgin Mary to be mother of His
manhood only, whereby he made the person of His flesh one thing, and
that of His Godhead another, and did not recognize the one Christ in the
Word of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p10.1"></span>God</span>
and in the flesh, but spoke of the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p10.2"></span>God</span> as separate and distinct from
the son of man:  although, without losing that unchangeable essence
which belongs to Him together with the Father and the Holy Spirit from
all eternity and without respect of time, the “Word became flesh” within
the Virgin’s womb in such wise that by that one conception and one
parturition she was at the same time, in virtue of the union of the two
substances, both handmaid and mother of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p10.3"></span>Lord</span>.  This Elizabeth also knew,
as Luke the evangelist declares, when she said:  “Whence is this to me
that the mother of my <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p10.4"></span>Lord</span> should come to me <span
id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517.md) ?”  But Eutyches also must be stricken
with the same anathema, who, becoming entangled in the treacherous
errors of the old heretics, has chosen the third dogma of
Apollinaris <span id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md) :  so that he denies
the reality of his human flesh and soul, and maintains the whole of our
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p12.2"></span>Lord</span> Jesus
Christ to be of one nature, as if the Godhead of the Word had turned
itself into flesh and soul:  and as if to be conceived and born, to be
nursed and grow, to be crucified and die, to be buried and rise again,
and to ascend into heaven and to sit on the Father’s right hand, from
whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead—as if all those
things belonged to that essence only which admits of none of them <span
id="page_92">p. 92</span> <span id="ii.iv.cxviii-Page_92"></span>without
the reality of the flesh:  seeing that the nature of the Only-begotten
is the nature of the Father, the nature of the Holy Spirit, and that the
undivided unity and consubstantial equality of the eternal Trinity is at
once impassible and unchangeable.  But if <span
id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519.md) this heretic withdraws from the
perverse views of Apollinaris, lest he be proved to hold that the
Godhead is passible <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md) and mortal: 
and yet dares to pronounce the nature of the Incarnate Word that is of
the Word made Flesh one, he undoubtedly crosses over into the mad view
of Manichæus <span id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521.md) and Marcion <span
id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522.md) , and believes that the man Jesus
Christ, the mediator between <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p16.1"></span>God</span> and men, did all things in an
unreal way, and had not a human body, but that a phantom-like apparition
presented itself to the beholders’ eyes.

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p17"></span>III.  *The acknowledgment of our
nature in Christ is necessary to orthodoxy*.

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p18"></span>As these iniquitous lies were once
rejected by the catholic Faith, and such men’s blasphemies condemned by
the unanimous votes of the blessed Fathers throughout the world, whoever
these are that are so blinded and strange to the light of truth as to
deny the presence of human, that is our, nature in the Word of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p18.1"></span>God</span> from the time
of the Incarnation, they must show on what ground they claim the name of
Christian, and in what way they harmonize with the true Gospel, if the
child-bearing of the blessed Virgin produced either the flesh without
the Godhead or the Godhead without the flesh.  For as it cannot be
denied that “the Word became flesh and dwelt in us <span
id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523.md) ,” so it cannot be denied that “<span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p19.2"></span>God</span> was in <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p19.3"></span>Christ</span>,
reconciling the world to Himself <span id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524.md)
.”  But what reconciliation can there be, whereby <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p20.2"></span>God</span> might be propitiated for the
human race, unless the mediator between <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p20.3"></span>God</span> and man took up the cause of
all?  And in what way could He properly fulfil His mediation, unless He
who in the form of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p20.4"></span>God</span> was equal to the Father, were
a sharer of our nature also in the form of a slave:  so that the one new
Man might effect a renewal of the old:  and the bond of death fastened
on us by one man’s wrong-doing <span id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md)
might be loosened by the death of the one Man who alone owed nothing to
death.  For the pouring out of the blood of the righteous on behalf of
the unrighteous was so powerful in its effect <span
id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md) , so rich a ransom that, if the whole
body of us prisoners only believed in their Redeemer, not one would be
held in the tyrant’s bonds:  since as the Apostle says, “where sin
abounded, grace also did much more abound <span
id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) .”  And since we, who were born under
the imputation <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) of sin, have
received the power of a new birth unto righteousness, the gift of
liberty has become stronger than the debt of slavery.

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p25"></span>IV.  *They only benefit by the blood
of Christ who truly share in His death and resurrection.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p26"></span>What hope then do they, who deny the
reality of the human person in our Saviour’s body, leave for themselves
in the efficacy of this mystery?  Let them say by what sacrifice they
have been reconciled, by what blood-shedding brought back.  Who is He
“who gave Himself for us an offering and a victim to <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p26.1"></span>God</span> for a sweet
smell <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) :”  or what sacrifice was
ever more hallowed than that which the true High priest placed upon the
altar of the cross by the immolation of His own flesh?  For although in
the sight of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p27.2"></span>Lord</span> the death of many of His
saints has been precious <span id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) , yet
no innocent’s death was the propitiation of the world.  The righteous
have received, not given, crowns:  and from the endurance of the
faithful have arisen examples of patience, not the gift of
justification.  For their deaths affected themselves alone, and no one
has paid off another’s debt by his own death <span
id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md) :  one alone among the sons of <span
id="page_93">p. 93</span> <span id="ii.iv.cxviii-Page_93"></span>men,
our Lord Jesus Christ, stands out as One in whom all are crucified, all
dead, all buried, all raised again.  Of them He Himself said “when I am
lifted from the earth, I will draw all (things) unto Me <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md) .”  True faith also, that justifies
the transgressors and makes them just, is drawn to Him who shared their
human natures and wins salvation in Him, in whom alone man finds himself
not guilty; and thus is free to glory in the power of Him who in the
humiliation of our flesh engaged in conflict with the haughty foe, and
shared His victory with those in whose body He had triumphed.

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p31"></span>V.  *The actions of Christ’s two
natures must be kept distinct.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p32"></span>Although therefore in our one <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p32.1"></span>Lord</span> Jesus
Christ, the true Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p32.2"></span>God</span> and man, the person of the
Word and of the flesh is one, and both beings have their actions in
common <span id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md) :  yet we must understand
the character of the acts themselves, and by the contemplation of
sincere faith distinguish those to which the humility of His weakness is
brought from those to which His sublime power is inclined:  what it is
that the flesh without the Word or the Word without the flesh does not
do.  For instance, without the power of the Word the Virgin would not
have conceived nor brought forth:  and without the reality of the flesh
His infancy would not have laid wrapt in swaddling clothes.  Without the
power of the Word the Magi would not have adored the Child that a new
star had pointed out to them:  and without the reality of the flesh that
Child would not have been ordered to be carried away into Egypt and
withdrawn from Herod’s persecution.  Without the power of the Word the
Father’s voice uttered from the sky would not have said, “This is My
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased <span
id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534.md) :”  and without the reality of the
flesh John would not have been able to point to Him and say:  “Behold
the Lamb of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p34.2"></span>God</span>, behold Him that beareth away
the sins of the world <span id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535.md) .” 
Without the power of the Word there would have been no restoring of the
sick to health, no raising of the dead to life:  and without the reality
of the flesh He would not have hungered and needed food, nor grown weary
and needed rest.  Lastly, without the power of the Word, the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p35.2"></span>Lord</span> would not
have professed Himself equal to the Father, and without the reality of
the flesh He would not also have said that the Father was greater than
He:  for the catholic Faith upholds and defends both positions,
believing the only Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p35.3"></span>God</span> to be both Man and the Word
according to the distinctive properties of His divine and human
substance.

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p36"></span>VI.  *There is no confusion of the
two natures in Christ* <span id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536.md) .

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p38"></span>Although therefore from that
beginning whereby in the Virgin’s womb “the Word became flesh,” no sort
of division ever arose between the Divine and the human substance, and
through all the growth and changes of His body, the actions were of one
Person the whole time, yet we do not by any mixing of them up confound
those very acts which were done inseparably:  and from the character of
the acts we perceive what belonged to either form.  For neither do His
Divine acts affect <span id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537.md) His human,
nor His human acts His Divine, since both concur in this way and to this
very end that in their operation His twofold qualities be not absorbed
the one by the other, nor His individuality doubled.  Therefore let
those Christian phantom-mongers <span id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538.md)
tell us, what nature of the Saviour’s it was that was fastened to the
wood of the Cross, that lay in the tomb, and that on the third day rose
in the flesh when the stone was rolled away from the grave:  or what
kind of body Jesus presented to His disciples’ eyes entering when the
doors were shut upon them:  seeing that to drive away the beholders’
disbelief, He required them to inspect with their eyes and to handle
with their hands the still open prints of the nails and the flesh wound
of His pierced side.  But if in spite of the truth being so clear, their
persistence in heresy will not abandon their position in the darkness,
let them show whence they promise themselves the hope of eternal life,
which no one can attain to, save through the mediator between <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p40.1"></span>God</span> and man, the
man Jesus Christ.  For “there is not another name given to men under
heaven, in which they must be saved <span
id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539.md) .”  Neither is there any ransoming of
men from captivity, save in His blood, “who gave Himself a ransom for
all <span id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540.md) :”  who, as the blessed
apostle proclaims, “when He was in the form of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p42.2"></span>God</span>, thought it not robbery that
He was equal with <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p42.3"></span>God</span>; but emptied Himself,
receiving the form of a slave, being made in the likeness of men, and
being found in fashion as a man He humbled Himself, being made obedient
even unto death, the death of the cross.  For which reason <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p42.4"></span>God</span> <span
id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span id="ii.iv.cxviii-Page_94"></span>also
exalted Him, and gave Him a name which is above every name:  that in the
name of Jesus every knee may bow of things in heaven, of things on the
earth, and of things under the earth, and that every tongue may confess
that the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p42.5"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ is in the glory
of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p42.6"></span>God</span> the
Father <span id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541.md) .”

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p44"></span>VII.  *It was as being “in form of a
slave,” not as Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p44.1"></span>God</span> that he was exalted*.

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p45"></span> <span
id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542.md) Although therefore the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p46.1"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ
is one, and the true Godhead and true Manhood in Him forms absolutely
one and the same person, and the entirety of this union cannot be
separated by any division, yet the exaltation wherewith “<span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p46.2"></span>God</span> exalted Him,”
and “gave Him a name which excels every name,” we understand to belong
to that form which needed to be enriched by this increase of glory <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543.md) .  Of course “in the form of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p47.1"></span>God</span>” the Son was
equal to the Father, and between the Father and the Only-begotten there
was no distinction in point of essence, no diversity in point of
majesty:  nor through the mystery <span
id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md) of the Incarnation had the Word been
deprived of anything which should be restored Him by the Father’s gift. 
But “the form of a slave” by which the impassible Godhead fulfilled a
pledge of mighty loving-kindness <span id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md)
, is human weakness which was lifted up into the glory of the divine
power, the Godhead and the manhood being right from the Virgin’s
conception so completely united that without the manhood the divine
acts, and without the Godhead the human acts were not performed.  For
which reason as the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p49.2"></span>Lord</span> of majesty is said to have
been crucified, so He who from eternity is equal with <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p49.3"></span>God</span> is said to
have been exalted.  Nor does it matter by which substance Christ is
spoken of, since the unity of His person inseparably remaining He is at
once both wholly Son of man according to the flesh and wholly Son of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p49.4"></span>God</span>
according to His Godhead, which is one with the Father.  Whatever
therefore Christ received in time, He received in virtue of His manhood,
on which are conferred whatsoever it had not.  For according to the
power of the Word, “all things that the Father hath” the Son also hath
indiscriminately, and what “in the form of a slave” He received from the
Father, He also Himself gave in the form of the Father.  He is in
Himself at once both rich and poor; rich, because “in the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p49.5"></span>God</span>, and <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p49.6"></span>God</span> was the Word.  This was in the
beginning with <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p49.7"></span>God</span>.  All things were made through
Him, and without Him was made nothing:”  and poor because “the Word
became flesh and dwelt in us <span id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md) .” 
But what is that emptying of Himself, or that poverty except the
receiving of the form of a slave by which the majesty of the Word was
veiled, and the scheme for man’s redemption carried out?  For as the
original chains of our captivity could not be loosed, unless a man of
our race and of our nature appeared who was not under the prejudice of
the old debt, and who with his untainted blood might blot out the bond
of death <span id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md) , as it had from the
beginning been divinely fore-ordained, so it came to pass in the fulness
of the appointed time that the promise which had been proclaimed in many
ways might reach its long expected fulfilment, and that thus, what had
been frequently announced by one testimony after another, might have all
doubtfulness removed.

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p52"></span>VIII.  *A protest against their
faithlessness and inconsistency in this matter.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p53"></span>And so, as all these heresies have
been destroyed, which through the holy devotion of the presiding Fathers
have been cut off from the body of the catholic unity, and which
deserved to be exiles from Christ, because they have made the
Incarnation of the Word, which is the one salvation of those who believe
aright, a stone of offence and a stumbling-block to themselves, I am
surprised that you, beloved, have any difficulty in discerning the light
of the Truth.  And since it has been made clear by numerous explanations
that the Christian Faith was right in condemning both Nestorius and
Eutyches with Dioscorus, and that a man cannot be called a Christian who
gives his assent to the blasphemous opinion of either the one or the
other, I am grieved that you are, as I hear, doing despite to the
teaching of the Gospel and the Apostles by stirring up the various
bodies of citizens with seditions, by disturbing the churches, and by
inflicting not only insults, but even death, upon priests and bishops,
so that you lose sight of your resolves and profession <span
id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) through your fury and cruelty.  Where
is your rule of meekness and quietness? where is the long-suffering of
patience? where the tranquillity of peace? where the firm foundation of
love and courage of endurance? what evil persuasion has carried you off,
what persecution has <span id="page_95">p. 95</span> <span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-Page_95"></span>separated you from the gospel of
Christ? or what strange craftiness of the Deceiver has shown itself
that, forgetting the prophets and apostles, forgetting the health-giving
creed and confession which you pronounced before many witnesses when you
received the sacrament of baptism you should give yourselves up to the
Devil’s deceits? what effect would “the Claws <span
id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) ” and other cruel tortures have had on
you if the empty comments of heretics have had so much weight in taking
the purity of your faith by storm? you think you are acting for the
Faith and yet you go against the Faith.  You arm yourselves in the name
of the Church and yet fight against the Church.  Is this what you have
learnt from prophets, evangelists, and apostles? to deny the true flesh
of Christ, to subject the very essence of the Word to suffering and
death, to make our nature different from His who repaired it, and to
reckon all that the cross uplifted, that the spear pierced, that the
stone on the tomb received and gave back, to be only the work of Divine
power, and not also of human humility?  It is in reference to this
humility that the Apostle says, “For I do not blush for the Gospel <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) ,” inasmuch as he knew what a slur was
cast upon Christians by their enemies.  And, therefore, the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p56.2"></span>Lord</span> also made
proclamation, saying:  “he that shall confess Me before men him will I
also confess before My Father <span id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md)
.”  For these will not be worthy of the Son and the Father’s
acknowledgment in whom the flesh of Christ awakens no respect: and they
will prove themselves to have gained no virtue from the sign of the
cross <span id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md) who blush to avow with
their lips what they have consented to bear upon their brows.

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p59"></span>IX.  *An exhortation to accept the
catholic view of the Incarnation*.

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p60"></span>Give up, my sons, give up these
suggestions of the devil.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p60.1"></span>God’s</span> Truth nothing can impair,
but the Truth does not save us except in our flesh.  For, as the prophet
says, “truth is sprung out of the earth <span
id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) ,” and the Virgin Mary conceived the
Word in such wise that she ministered flesh of her substance to be
united to Him without the addition of a second person, and without the
disappearance of her nature:  seeing that He who was in the form of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p61.2"></span>God</span> took
the form of a slave in such wise that Christ is one and the same in both
forms:  <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p61.3"></span>God</span>
bending Himself to the weak things of man, and man rising up to the high
things of the Godhead, as the Apostle says, “whose are the fathers, and
from whom, according to the flesh is Christ, who is above all things
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p61.4"></span>God</span> blessed
for ever.  Amen <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) .”

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p12"></span> Cf. Ep. xxii.<span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p12.1"></span> chap. 3 “*conatus-antiqua impii
Valentini*” (the adherent of Apollinaris and head of one of the sections
of the Apollinarians after his death) “*et Apollinaris mala dogmata
renovare*.”  The third dogma of Apollinaris was that “Christ’s manhood
was formed out of a divine substance.”  Bright, 147.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[92:520](2120128.htm#fr_519.md) <span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p12.3"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p13"></span> Eutyches had expressly tried to
guard himself against this imputation:  Ep. xxi.<span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p13.1"></span> chap. 3, “*anathematizans Apollinarium
Valentinum, Manem et Nestorium, &c*.”  See Bright’s valuable notes 32,
33, 34, and esp. 35, where he shows that “it was polemical rhetoric to
say that he was reviving Apollinarian or Valentinian theories.”

<span id="fn_520"></span>[92:521](2120128.htm#fr_520.md) <span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p13.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p14"></span> It must be clearly understood that
this ugly word is here and elsewhere employed to translate *passibilis*
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p14.1"></span>παθητός</span>) for no reason, except the
necessity of the case:  *pati* and <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p14.2"></span>πάσχειν</span> are both of far wider and
broader signification than “suffer” or its synonyms:  they are simply
the passive of *facere* and <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p14.3"></span>ποιεῖν</span> (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.cxviii-p14.4"></span>πράσσειν</span>), and there is no proper
equivalent in ordinary English parlance.  This tendency of terms to
become more and more narrow and of particular application is constantly
meeting and baffling one in translating the Latin and Greek languages.

id="ii.iv.cxviii-p14.5"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p15"></span> Leo elsewhere also makes this hardly
justifiable inference that Eutychianism is a new form of Docetism as
this view was called; chap. vi. below, and Serm. lxv. c. 4 “*isti
phantasmatici Christiani*,” also xxviii. 4, and lxiv. 1, 2.  That the
Manichæans naturally held Docetic views on the Incarnation is obvious
when we remember that their fundamental misconception was that matter is
identical with evil.

id="ii.iv.cxviii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p16"></span> Marcion was the founder of one of
the most formidable Gnostic sects towards the close of the second
century:  Tertullian wrote a famous treatise (still extant) against
him.  Like other Gnostics, his views involved him in Docetism.

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p21"></span> *Prævaricatio*:  this is a legal
term which is often used of sin (esp. in connexion with Adam’s
transgression).  Its original technical meaning is the action of an
advocate who plays into the enemy’s hand.  In theology the devil (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p21.1"></span>διάβολος</span>) is
man’s adversary, and man himself is befooled into collusion with him by
breaking God’s Law.

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p22"></span> *Potens ad privilegium: 
privilegium* is another legal term signifying technically a bill framed
to meet an individual case generally in a detrimental way, such bills
being against the spirit of the Roman law:  here Leo uses it in a sense
more nearly approaching our English idea of “privilege.”

<span id="ii.iv.cxviii-p24"></span> *Sub peccati præiudicio*:  yet a
third legal term:  *præiudicium* in Roman law was a semi-formal and
anticipatory verdict by the judge before the case came on for final
decision in court; in chapter vi. we have the verb *præiudicare.*
