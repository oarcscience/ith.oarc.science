<span id="ii.iv.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXVIII <span
id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md) .</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxxviii-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxviii-p3.1"></span>To Flavian, Bishop of
Constantinople.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxxviii-p4"></span>Leo to Flavian, bishop of
Constantinople.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxviii-p5"></span>He acknowledges the receipt of a
letter and advises mercy if Eutyches will recant.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxviii-p6"></span>When our brethren had already started
whom we despatched to you in the cause of the Faith, we received your
letter, beloved, by our son Basil the deacon, in which you rightly said
very little on the subject of our common anxiety, both because the
accounts which had already arrived had given us full information on
every thing, and because for purposes of private inquiry it was easy to
converse with the aforesaid Basil, by whom now through the grace of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxxviii-p6.1"></span>God</span>, in
whom we trust, we exhort you, beloved, in reply, using the Apostle’s
words, and saying:  “Be ye in nothing affrighted by the adversaries;
which is for them a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) .”  For what is so calamitous as to
wish to destroy all hope of man’s salvation by denying the reality of
Christ’s Incarnation, and to contradict the Apostle who says
distinctly:  “great is the mystery of Godliness which was manifest in
the flesh <span id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md) ?”  What so glorious
as to fight for the Faith of the gospel against the enemies of Christ’s
nativity and cross?  About whose most pure light and unconquered power
we have already disclosed what was in our heart, in the letter which has
been sent to you beloved <span id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) :  lest
anything might seem doubtful between us on those things which we have
learnt, and teach in accordance with the catholic doctrine.  But seeing
that the testimonies to the Truth are so clear <span id="page_51">p.
51</span> <span id="ii.iv.xxxviii-Page_51"></span>and strong that a man
must be reckoned thoroughly blind and stubborn, who does not at once
shake himself free from the mists of falsehood in the bright light of
reason; we desire you to use the remedy of long-suffering in curing the
madness of ignorance that through your fatherly admonitions they who
though old in years are infants in mind, may learn to obey their
elders.  And if they give up the vain conceits of their ignorance and
come to their senses, and if they condemn all their errors and receive
the one true Faith, do not deny them the mercifulness of a bishop’s kind
heart:  although your judgment must remain, if their impiety which you
have deservedly condemned persists in its depravity.  Dated 23 July in
the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).

<span id="ii.iv.xxxviii-p2"></span> If we are right in thinking that
Lett. XXXVI. is Leo’s acknowledgment of Flavian’s second letter (XXVI.),
this (which again has no Gk. version) must be an acknowledgment of yet a
third, not extant, sent by the hand of one Basil, the deacon who is
probably the same as Julian’s messenger (XXXV., chap. i ).
