<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxv-p2"></span>To Desiderius and Syagrius, Bishops.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxv-p3"></span>Gregory to Desiderius of Vienna
(*Vienne*), and Syagrius of Augustodunum (*Autun*), Bishops of Gaul.  *A
paribus* <span id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668.md) .

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxv-p5"></span>Having regard to your sincere charity
we are well assured that out of love for Peter, the Prince of the
apostles, you will devotedly afford your succour to our men; especially
since the nature of the case requires you to give assistance even of
your own accord, and the more when you see them labour.  Wherefore we
inform your Holiness that, the Lord so ordering it, we have despatched
Augustine, the servant of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxv-p5.1"></span>God</span>, the bearer of these presents,
whose zeal and earnestness are well known to us, with other servants of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.xxxv-p5.2"></span>God</span>, in
behalf of souls in those parts; from whose account of things when you
have fully learnt what is enjoined on him, let your Fraternity bestow
your succour on him in all ways which the case may require, that you may
be able, as is becoming and fit, to be helpers of a good work.  Let,
then, your Fraternity study to shew yourself so devoted in this matter
that your action may prove to us the truth of the good report that we
have heard of you.  We commend to you in all respects our most beloved
common son, Candidus the presbyter, to whom we have committed the
patrimony of our Church situated in those parts.
