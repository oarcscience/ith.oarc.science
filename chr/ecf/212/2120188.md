<span id="ii.v.x"></span>

<span id="ii.v.x-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.x-p1.1"></span>Sermon XXI.</span>

<span id="ii.v.x-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.x-p2.1"></span>On the Feast of the Nativity, I.</span>

<span id="ii.v.x-p3"></span>I.  *All share in the joy of Christmas.*

<span id="ii.v.x-p4"></span>Our Saviour, dearly-beloved, was born
today:  let us be glad.  For there is no proper place for sadness, when
we keep the birthday of the Life, which destroys the fear of mortality
and brings to us the joy of promised eternity.  No one is kept from
sharing in this happiness.  There is for all one common measure of joy,
because as our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.x-p4.1"></span>Lord</span> the destroyer of sin and death finds
none free from charge, so is He come to free us all.  Let the saint
exult in that he draws near to victory.  Let the sinner be glad in that
he is invited to pardon.  Let the gentile take courage in that he is
called to life.  For the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.x-p4.2"></span>God</span> in the fulness of time which the
inscrutable depth of the Divine counsel has determined, has taken on him
the nature of man, thereby to reconcile it to its Author:  in order that
the inventor of death, the devil, might be conquered through that
(nature) which he had conquered.  And in this conflict undertaken for
us, the fight was fought on great and wondrous principles of fairness;
for the Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.x-p4.3"></span>Lord</span> enters the lists with His savage foe
not in His own majesty but in our humility, opposing him with the same
form and the same nature, which shares indeed our mortality, though it
is free from all sin.  Truly foreign to this nativity is that which we
read of all others, “no one is clean from stain, not even the infant who
has lived but one day upon earth <span id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722)
.”  Nothing therefore of the lust of the flesh has passed into that
peerless nativity, nothing of the law of sin has entered.  A royal
Virgin of the stem of David is chosen, to be impregnated with the sacred
seed and to conceive the Divinely-human offspring in mind first and then
in body.  And lest in ignorance of the heavenly counsel she should
tremble at so strange a result <span id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723) ,
she learns from converse with the angel that what is to be wrought in
her is of the Holy Ghost.  Nor does she believe it loss of honour that
she is soon to be the Mother of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.x-p6.1"></span>God <span id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724)
</span>.  For why should she be in despair over the novelty of such
conception, to whom the power of the most High has promised to effect
it.  Her implicit faith is confirmed also by the attestation of a
precursory miracle, and Elizabeth receives unexpected <span
id="page_129">p. 129</span> <span
id="ii.v.x-Page_129"></span>fertility:  in order that there might be no
doubt that He who had given conception to the barren, would give it even
to a virgin.

<span id="ii.v.x-p8"></span>II.  *The mystery of the Incarnation is a
fitting theme for joy both to angels and to men*.

<span id="ii.v.x-p9"></span>Therefore the Word of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.x-p9.1"></span>God</span>, Himself <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.x-p9.2"></span>God</span>, the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.x-p9.3"></span>God</span> who “in the beginning was with <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.x-p9.4"></span>God</span>,” through whom “all
things were made” and “without” whom “was nothing made <span
id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725) ,” with the purpose of delivering man
from eternal death, became man:  so bending Himself to take on Him our
humility without decrease in His own majesty, that remaining what He was
and assuming what He was not, He might unite the true form of a slave to
that form in which He is equal to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.x-p10.2"></span>God</span> the Father, and join both natures
together by such a compact that the lower should not be swallowed up in
its exaltation nor the higher impaired by its new associate.   <span
id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726) Without detriment therefore to the
properties of either substance which then came together in one person,
majesty took on humility, strength weakness, eternity mortality:  and
for the paying off of the debt, belonging to our condition, inviolable
nature was united with possible nature, and true <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.x-p11.1"></span>God</span> and true man were combined to form
one <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.x-p11.2"></span>Lord</span>, so
that, as suited the needs of our case, one and the same Mediator between
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.x-p11.3"></span>God</span> and men, the
Man Christ Jesus, could both die with the one and rise again with the
other <span id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727) .

<span id="ii.v.x-p13"></span>Rightly therefore did the birth of our
Salvation impart no corruption to the Virgin’s purity, because the
bearing of the Truth was the keeping of honour.  Such then beloved was
the nativity which became the Power of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.x-p13.1"></span>God</span> and the Wisdom of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.x-p13.2"></span>God</span> even Christ,
whereby He might be one with us in manhood and surpass us in Godhead. 
For unless He were true <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.x-p13.3"></span>God</span>, He would not bring us a remedy,
unless He were true Man, He would not give us an example.  Therefore the
exulting angel’s song when the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.x-p13.4"></span>Lord</span> was born is this, “Glory to <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.x-p13.5"></span>God</span> in the Highest,”
and their message, “peace on earth to men of good will <span
id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728) .”  For they see that the heavenly
Jerusalem is being built up out of all the nations of the world:  and
over that indescribable work of the Divine love how ought the humbleness
of men to rejoice, when the joy of the lofty angels is so great?

<span id="ii.v.x-p15"></span>III.  *Christians then must live worthily
of Christ their Head*.

<span id="ii.v.x-p16"></span>Let us then, dearly beloved, give thanks to
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.x-p16.1"></span>God</span> the Father,
through His Son, in the Holy Spirit <span
id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729) , Who “for His great mercy, wherewith
He has loved us,” has had pity on us:  and “when we were dead in sins,
has quickened us together in Christ <span
id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730) ,” that we might be in Him a new
creation and a new production.  Let us put off then the old man with his
deeds:  and having obtained a share in the birth of Christ let us
renounce the works of the flesh.  Christian, acknowledge thy dignity,
and becoming a partner in the Divine nature, refuse to return to the old
baseness by degenerate conduct.  Remember the Head and the Body of which
thou art a member.  Recollect that thou wert rescued from the power of
darkness and brought out into <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.x-p18.2"></span>God’s</span> light and kingdom.  By the mystery
of Baptism thou wert made the temple of the Holy Ghost:  do not put such
a denizen to flight from thee by base acts, and subject thyself once
more to the devil’s thraldom:  because thy purchase money is the blood
of Christ, because He shall judge thee in truth Who ransomed thee in
mercy, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit reigns for ever and
ever.  Amen.

that Leo here uses, though in a catholic sense, that form of doxology
which had become associated with Arianism.  He could well afford to do
as S. Athanasius had done, who ascribes glory to the Father “through the
Son” at the conclusion of four treatises.  Bright.
