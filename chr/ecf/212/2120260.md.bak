<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p2"></span>What diversity there ought to be in
the art of preaching.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p3"></span>Differently to be admonished are these
that follow:—

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p4"></span>Men and women.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p5"></span>The poor and the rich.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p6"></span>The joyful and the sad.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p7"></span>Prelates and subordinates.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p8"></span>Servants and masters.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p9"></span>The wise of this world and the dull.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p10"></span>The impudent and the bashful.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p11"></span>The forward and the fainthearted.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p12"></span>The impatient and the patient.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p13"></span>The kindly disposed and the envious.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p14"></span>The simple and the insincere.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p15"></span>The whole and the sick.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p16"></span>Those who fear scourges, and
therefore live innocently; and those who have grown so hard in iniquity
as not to be corrected even by scourges.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p17"></span>The too silent, and those who spend
time in much speaking.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p18"></span>The slothful and the hasty.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p19"></span>The meek and the passionate.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p20"></span>The humble and the haughty.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p21"></span>The obstinate and the fickle.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p22"></span>The gluttonous and the abstinent.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p23"></span>Those who mercifully give of their
own, and those who would fain seize what belongs to others.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p24"></span>Those who neither seize the things of
others nor are bountiful with their own; and those who both give away
the things they have, and yet cease not to seize the things of others.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p25"></span>Those that are at variance, and those
that are at peace.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p26"></span>Lovers of strifes and peacemakers.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p27"></span>Those that understand not aright the
words of sacred law; and those who understand them indeed aright, but
speak them without humility.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p28"></span>Those who, though able to preach
worthily, are afraid through excessive humility; and those whom
imperfection or age debars from preaching, and yet rashness impels to
it.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p29"></span>Those who prosper in what they desire
in temporal matters; and those who covet indeed the things that are of
the world, and yet are wearied with the toils of adversity.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p30"></span>Those who are bound by wedlock, and
those who are free from the ties of wedlock.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p31"></span>Those who have had experience of
carnal intercourse, and those who are ignorant of it.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p32"></span>Those who deplore sins of deed, and
those who deplore sins of thought.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p33"></span>Those who bewail misdeeds, yet
forsake them not; and those who forsake them, yet bewail them not.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p34"></span>Those who even praise the unlawful
things they do; and those who censure what is wrong, yet avoid it not.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p35"></span>Those who are overcome by sudden
passion, and those who are bound in guilt of set purpose.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p36"></span> <span id="page_25b">p. 25b</span>
<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-Page_25b"></span>Those who, though their unlawful
deeds are trivial, yet do them frequently; and those who keep themselves
from small sins, but are occasionally whelmed in graver ones.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p37"></span>Those who do not even begin what is
good, and those who fail entirely to complete the good begun.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p38"></span>Those who do evil secretly and good
publicly; and those who conceal the good they do, and yet in some things
done publicly allow evil to be thought of them.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p39"></span>But of what profit is it for us to
run through all these things collected together in a list, unless we
also set forth, with all possible brevity, the modes of admonition for
each?

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p40"></span>(*Admonition* 1.)  Differently, then,
to be admonished are men and women; because on the former heavier
injunctions, on the latter lighter are to be laid, that those may be
exercised by great things, but these winningly converted by light ones.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p41"></span>(*Admonition* 2.)  Differently to be
admonished are young men and old; because for the most part severity of
admonition directs the former to improvement, while kind remonstrance
disposes the latter to better deeds.  For it is written, *Rebuke not an
elder, but entreat him as a father* ([1 Tim. v.
1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p41.1"></span>).&gt;
