id="iii.v.i.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Epistle LVII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxix-p2"></span>To Severus, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxix-p3"></span>Gregory to Severus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxix-p4"></span>We learn from thy Fraternity’s
epistle that, with regard to the choice of a bishop, some are agreed in
favour of Ocleatinus, with whom, since we disallow him, they need not
further concern themselves <span id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372.md) . 
But give notice to the inhabitants of that city that, if they should
find any one in their own Church fit for that work, they all transfer
their choice to him.  Otherwise the bearer of these presents will point
out a person, of whom I have told him, in favour of whom the
notification of the election should be made.  Do you, moreover, be
prudent and careful with regard to your visitation of the same Church,
that its property may be preserved inviolate, and its interests attended
to after the accustomed manner under your management.

to act as visitor during the vacancy, was bishop of Ficulum, or Ficocle
in the same province.  See V. 25.
