<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.cxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter CXIX.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.cxiv-p2.1"></span>To Maximus, Bishop of Antioch, by the hand
of Marian the Presbyter, and Olympius the Deacon.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p3"></span>Leo to Maximus of Antioch.

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p4"></span>I.  *The Faith is the mean between the
two extremes of Eutyches and Nestorius.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p5"></span>How much, beloved, you have at heart the
most sacred unity of our common Faith and the tranquil harmony of the
Church’s peace, the substance of your letter shows, which was brought me
by our sons, Marian the presbyter and Olympius the deacon, and which was
the more welcome to us because thereby we can join as it were in
conversation, and thus the grace of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxiv-p5.1"></span>God</span> becomes more and more known and
greater joy is felt through the whole world over the revelation of
catholic Truth.  And yet we are sore grieved at some who still (so your
messengers indicate) love their darkness; and though the brightness of
day has arisen everywhere, even still delight in the obscurity of their
blindness, and abandoning the Faith, remain Christians in only the empty
name, without knowledge to discern one error from another, and to
distinguish the blasphemy of Nestorius from the impiety of Eutyches. 
For no delusion of theirs can appear excusable, because they contradict
themselves in their perverseness.  For, though Eutyches’ disciples abhor
Nestorius, and the followers of Nestorius anathematize Eutyches, yet in
the judgment of catholics both sides are condemned and both heresies
alike are cut away from the body of the Church:  because neither
falsehood can be in unison with us.  Nor does it matter in which
direction of blasphemy they disagree with the truth of the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p5.2"></span>Lord’s</span> Incarnation,
since their erroneous opinions hold neither with the authority of the
Gospel nor with the significance of the mystery <span
id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) .

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p7"></span>II.  *Maximus is to keep the churches of
the East free from these two opposite heresies.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p8"></span>And therefore, beloved brother, you must
with all your heart consider over which church the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p8.1"></span>Lord</span> has set you to
preside, and remember that system of doctrine of which the chief of all
the Apostles, the blessed Peter, laid the foundation, not only by his
uniform preaching throughout the world, but especially by his teaching
in the cities of Antioch and Rome:  so that you may understand that he
demands of him who is set over the home of his own renown those
institutions which he handed down, as he received them from the Truth
Itself, which he confessed.  And in the churches of the East, and
especially in those which the canons of the most holy Fathers at
Nicæa <span id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) assigned to the See of
Antioch, you must not by any means allow unscrupulous heretics to make
assaults on the Gospel, and <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span
id="ii.iv.cxiv-Page_86"></span>the dogmas of either Nestorius or
Eutyches to be maintained by any one.  Since, as I have said, the rock
(*petra*) of the catholic Faith, from which the blessed Apostle Peter
took his name at the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxiv-p9.1"></span>Lord’s</span> hands, rejects every trace of
either heresy; for it openly and clearly anathematizes Nestorius for
separating the nature of the Word and of the flesh in the blessed
Virgin’s conception, for dividing the one Christ into two, and for
wishing to distinguish between the person of the Godhead and the person
of the Manhood:  because He is altogether one and the same who in His
eternal Deity was born of the Father without time, and in His true flesh
was born of His mother in time; and similarly it eschews Eutyches for
ignoring the reality of the human flesh in the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxiv-p9.2"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, and asserting the
transformation of the Word Himself into flesh, so that His birth,
nurture, growth, suffering, death and burial, and resurrection on the
third day, all belonged to His Deity only, which put on not the reality
but the semblance of the form of a slave.

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p10"></span>III.  *Antioch as the third See in
Christendom is to retain her privileges.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p11"></span>And so it behoves you to use the utmost
vigilance, lest these depraved heretics dare to assert themselves; for
you must resist them with all the authority of priests, and frequently
inform us by your reports what is being done for the progress of the
churches.  For it is right that you should share this responsibility
with the Apostolic See, and realize that the privileges of the third See
in Christendom <span id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) give you every
confidence in action, privileges which no intrigues shall in any way
impair:  because my respect for the Nicene canons is such that I never
have allowed nor ever will the institutions of the holy Fathers to be
violated by any innovation.  For different sometimes as are the deserts
of individual prelates, yet the rights of their Sees are permanent:  and
although rivalry may perchance cause some disturbance about them, yet it
cannot impair their dignity.  Wherefore, brother, if ever you consider
any action ought to be taken to uphold the privileges of the church of
Antioch, be sure to explain it in a letter of your own, that we may be
able to reply to your application completely and appropriately.

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p13"></span>IV.  *Anatolius’ attempts to subvert
the decisions of Nicæa are futile.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p14"></span>But at the present time let it be
enough to make a general proclamation on all points, that if in any
synod any one makes any attempt upon or seems to take occasion of
wresting an advantage against the provisions of the Nicene canons, he
can inflict no discredit upon their inviolable decrees:  and it will be
easier for the compacts of any conspiracy to be broken through than for
the regulations of the aforesaid canons to be in any particular
invalidated.  For intrigue loses no opportunity of stealing an
advantage, and whenever the course of things brings about a general
assembly of priests, it is difficult for the greediness of the
unscrupulous not to try to gain some unfair point:  just as in the Synod
of Ephesus which overthrew the blasphemous Nestorius with his dogma,
bishop Juvenal believed that he was capable of holding the presidency of
the province of Palestine, and ventured to rally the insubordinate by a
lying letter <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) .  At which Cyril
of blessed memory, bishop of Alexandria, being properly dismayed,
pointed out in his letter to me <span id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md)
to what audacity the other’s cupidity had led him:  and with anxious
entreaty begged me hard that no assent should be given his unlawful
attempts.  For be it known to you that we found the original document of
Cyril’s letter which was sought for in our book-case, and of which you
sent us copies.  On this, however, my judgment lays especial stress
that, although a majority of priests through the wiliness of some came
to a decision which is found opposed to those constitutions of the 318
fathers, it must be considered void on principles of justice:  since the
peace of the whole Church cannot otherwise be preserved, except due
respect be invariably shown to the canons.

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p17"></span>V.  *If Leo’s legates in any way
exceeded their instructions, they did so ineffectually.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p18"></span>Of course, if anything is alleged to
have been done by those brethren whom I sent in my stead to the holy
Synod, beyond that which was germane to the Faith, it shall be of no
weight at all:  because they were sent by the Apostolic See only for the
purpose of <span id="page_87">p. 87</span> <span
id="ii.iv.cxiv-Page_87"></span>extirpating heresy and upholding the
catholic Faith.  For whatever is laid before bishops for inquiry beyond
the particular subjects which come before synodal councils may admit of
a certain amount of free discussion, if the holy Fathers have laid down
nothing thereon at Nicæa.  For anything that is not in agreement with
their rules and constitutions can never obtain the assent of the
Apostolic See.  But how great must be the diligence with which this rule
is kept, you will gather from the copies of the letter which we sent to
the bishop of Constantinople, restraining his cupidity; and you shall
take order that it reach the knowledge of all our brethren and
fellow-priests.

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p19"></span>VI.  *No one but priests are allowed to
preach.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p20"></span>This too it behoves you, beloved, to
guard against, that no one except those who are the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p20.1"></span>Lord’s</span> priests dare
to claim the right of teaching or preaching, be he monk or layman <span
id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) , who boasts himself of some
knowledge.  Because although it is desirable that all the Church’s sons
should understand the things which are right and sound, yet it is
permitted to none outside the priestly rank to assume the office of
preacher, since in the Church of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxiv-p21.1"></span>God</span> all things ought to be orderly,
that in Christ’s one body the more excellent members should fulfil their
own duties, and the lower not resist the higher.  Dated the 11th of
June, in the consulship of the illustrious Opilio (453).

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p9"></span> These were apparently twenty in number,
but include no very important towns except Seleucia the seaport of
Antioch.

id="ii.iv.cxiv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p12"></span> *Privilegia tertiæ sedis*.  Leo here
still assigns to Antioch the third place in order of precedence, Rome
and Alexandria being first and second respectively; but since 381, as we
have seen, e.g. in Lett. XCVIII., chap. iv., it had been lowered to the
4th place by the insertion of Constantinople between Rome and
Alexandria:  see Schaff’s Hist., Vol. II. § 56, pp. 277 and following,
and Gore’s Leo, pp. 119 and foll.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[86:486](2120124.htm#fr_485.md) <span
id="ii.iv.cxiv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p15"></span> It is a curious fact in the history of
Church government that the bishopric of Jerusalem for the first
centuries never had the first place in Palestine:  this was assigned to
the metropolitan of Cæsarea, although on great occasions the Bishop of
Jerusalem sat next to the patriarch of Antioch:  cf. Schaff’s Hist.,
Vol. II. 56, p. 283, and the viith. Nicene canon:  *mos antiquus
obtineat ut Aeliæ, id est Ierosolymæ, episcopus honoretur salva
metropolis propria dignitate.*

id="ii.iv.cxiv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxiv-p16"></span> The Ballerinii point out that the 1st
Council of Ephesus was held in 431, at which Cyril presided for
Celestinus I. of Rome and that Leo was not bishop till 441; this letter
was probably addressed to him when archdeacon of Rome, in which case the
authority which he had already gained is remarkably illustrated.
