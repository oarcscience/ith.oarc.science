<span id="iii.v.vi.iii-p2"></span>To Maximus of Salona.

<span id="iii.v.vi.iii-p3"></span>Gregory to Maximus, pretender to the
Church of Salona <span id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629) .

<span id="iii.v.vi.iii-p5"></span>As often as anything is said to have
been done contrary to ecclesiastical discipline, we dare not leave it
unexamined, lest we should be guilty before <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.iii-p5.1"></span>God</span> for connivance.  Now it has
come to our ears that thou wast ordained by means of simoniacal heresy. 
Nay and many other things have been said of thee here, whereof there was
one especially on account of which we held it needful to prohibit thee
urgently by letter from celebrating the solemnities of mass until we
might ascertain the state of the case more certainly.  Wherefore, lest
the children of the Church should be too long without a shepherd, and
lest, in case of these things which are said remaining unexamined, vice
of this nature should extend itself to many, we exhort thee to make
haste to come to us, laying aside all excuses, to the end that with due
regard to justice we may be able to gain knowledge of these things, and
terminate them according to the canonical institutes, Christ shewing us
the way.  But do thou so act that there be no more of these successive
delays of thy coming, lest thy very absence point thee out as the more
obnoxious to these charges against thee, and lest we should be thus
compelled to pass in council a harder sentence on thee, not only for thy
alleged crimes from which thou evadest purging thyself, but also for the
fault of disobedience, to wit as one that is contumacious.

stated, Maximus does not seem to have paid the slightest attention to
this letter.
