<span id="iii.v.ii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Epistle VI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.ii-p2"></span>To the Neapolitans.

<span id="iii.v.ii.ii-p3"></span>Gregory to the clergy, nobles, gentry,
and commonalty <span id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396.md) dwelling at
Naples.

<span id="iii.v.ii.ii-p5"></span>Although the sincere devotion of
spiritual sons in behalf of their mother Church needs no exhortation,
nevertheless, it ought to be stirred up by letter, lest it should
suppose itself slighted.  On this account I approach your love with an
admonition of paternal charity, that with many tears and with one accord
we may render thanks to our Redeemer, who has not suffered you to walk
along pathless ways under so perverse a teacher, but has made publicly
known the crimes of your unworthy pastor.  For Demetrius, to wit, who
even before had not deserved to be called a bishop, has been found to be
involved in transactions to such an extent and of such a kind that, if
he had received judgment without mercy according to the character of his
deeds, he would undoubtedly have been condemned to a most hard death by
both divine and human laws.  But since, being reserved for penance, he
has been deprived of the dignity of the priesthood, we cannot suffer the
Church of <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.ii-p5.1"></span>God</span>
to remain long without a teacher, since it is laid down by canonical
rules that, on the death or removal of a pastor, the church should not
be long deprived of the priesthood <span
id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397.md) .  Wherefore, I have thought it
necessary to admonish your Charity by this present writing that neither
delay nor the discord which has been wont to generate scandals ensue to
hinder your election of a pontiff.  But seek you out with all care such
a person as all by common consent may rejoice in, and as is in no
respect rejected by the sacred canons; to the end that the office which
the most wicked of men had polluted by his evil administration may be
worthily filled and administered by him, whoever he may be, who, by the
grace of Christ, and with His approval, shall be ordained.

<span id="fn_1396"></span>[101b:1397](2120357.htm#fr_1396.md) <span
id="iii.v.ii.ii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.ii-p4"></span> *Clero, nobilibus, ordini et plebi. 
Ordo* seems to denote persons of official or other rank, above the
commonalty, but below the nobility.  In some cases the corresponding
address is to *clero, ordini et plebi* (as in I. 81; V. 26); in others
to *clero et nobilibus* only.  All such expressions shew that the
election of bishops rested with the members, laity as well as clergy, of
each church, though the bishop of Rome, wherever his jurisdiction
extended reserved to himself the power of approving or disallowing the
election.  In the election at Naples, referred to in this Epistle, there
appears to have been a difficulty in arriving at an unanimous choice. 
Other Epistles referring to the case are II. 9, 10, 15, 26; III. 35. 
From the last of these it appears how it was eventually settled.  See
especially note 6 under II. 9.

<span id="iii.v.ii.ii-p6"></span> *Sacerdotii*; meaning here
episcopacy.  See I. 78, note 2.
