<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p2"></span>That none should enter on a place of
government who practise not in life what they have learnt by study.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p3"></span>There are some also who investigate
spiritual precepts with cunning care, but what they penetrate with their
understanding they trample on in their lives:  all at once they teach
the things which not by practice but by study they have learnt; and what
in words they preach by their manners they impugn.  Whence it comes to
pass that when the shepherd walks through steep places, the flock
follows to the precipice.  Hence it is that the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p3.1"></span>Lord</span> through the prophet complains
of the contemptible knowledge of shepherds, saying, *When ye yourselves
had drunk most pure water, ye fouled the residue with your feet; and My
sheep fed on that which had been trodden by your feet, and drank that
which your feet had fouled* ([Ezek.
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p3.2"></span>).  For indeed the shepherds drink most
pure water, when with a right understanding they imbibe the streams of
truth.  But to foul the same water with their feet is to corrupt the
studies of holy meditation by evil living.  And verily the sheep drink
the water fouled by their feet, when any of those subject to them follow
not the words which they hear, but only imitate the bad examples which
they see.  Thirsting for the things said, but perverted by the works
observed, they take in mud with their draughts, as from polluted
fountains.  Hence also it is written through the prophet, *A snare for
the downfall of my people are evil priests* ([Hos.
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md), [Hos.
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p3.3"></span>).  Hence again the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p3.4"></span>Lord</span> through the
prophet says of the priests, *They are made to be for a stumbling-block
of iniquity to the house of Israel.*  For certainly no one does more
harm in the Church than one who has the name and rank of sanctity, while
he acts perversely.  For him, when he transgresses, no one presumes to
take to task; and the offence spreads forcibly for example, when out of
reverence to his rank the sinner is honoured.  But all who are unworthy
would fly from the burden of so great guilt, if with the attentive ear
of the heart they weighed the sentence of the Truth, *Whoso shall offend
one of these little ones* <span id="page_3b">p. 3b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.iii-Page_3b"></span>*which believe in me, it were better
for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were drowned
in the depth of the sea* ([Matth. xviii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p3.5"></span>).  By the millstone is expressed the
round and labour of worldly life, and by the depth of the sea is denoted
final damnation.  Whosoever, then, having come to bear the outward show
of sanctity, either by word or example destroys others, it had indeed
been better for him that earthly deeds in open guise should press him
down to death than that sacred offices should point him out to others as
imitable in his wrong-doing; because, surely, if he fell alone, the
pains of hell would torment him in more tolerable degree.
