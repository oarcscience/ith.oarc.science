id="iii.v.viii.x-p1.1"></span>Epistle XVII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.x-p2"></span>To Maurentius.

<span id="iii.v.viii.x-p3"></span>Gregory to Maurentius, magister
militum <span id="fr_1740"></span>[1741](#fn_1740) .

<span id="iii.v.viii.x-p5"></span>My most beloved son, Cyprian the
deacon, had pleased me much by his return to me, if his whole self had
returned to me.  But now that your Glory has stayed in Sicily, I know
most certainly that he has returned indeed in body, but in mind has
remained in Sicily.  Yet, in saying this, I rejoice with you for your
quiet as much as I groan for my own occupations.  And to this I
earnestly exhort you, that, if the pleasant savour of inward sweetness
has touched the palate of your heart, your mind be so rapt within itself
that all which sounds without, all that delights without, may be
distasteful.  Moreover I commend you for avoiding concourses of men,
seeing that a mind which desires to be renewed in <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.x-p5.1"></span>God</span> through the grace of
compunction often relapses into its old state through evil conversation
and words.  I have sought for some to join you in a society for sacred
reading, but have found no one, and I exceedingly lament the scarcity of
what is good.  And though I, a sinner, am very much occupied, yet, if
you should wish to come to the threshold of the blessed apostle Peter,
you will be able to have me as a close associate in the study of Holy
Writ.  May Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.x-p5.2"></span>God</span> keep you under His heavenly
protection, and grant you to remain defended against the snares of the
ancient foe.

<span id="iii.v.viii.x-p4"></span> This letter is interesting as one of
those which shew Gregory’s carefulness to retain influence over pious
lay friends of position, and his uniform tone of courtesy in addressing
them.  Maurentius appears to have been a military officer of studious
habits in Sicily.
