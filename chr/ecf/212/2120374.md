id="iii.v.ii.xix-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXIV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.xix-p2"></span>To Maximianus, Bishop of Syracuse.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xix-p3"></span>Gregory to Maximianus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xix-p4"></span>I remember to have often admonished
you to be by no means hasty in passing sentence.  And lo, I have now
learnt that your Fraternity in a fit of anger has excommunicated the
most reverend abbot Eusebius.  Now I am much <span id="page_111b">p.
111b</span> <span id="iii.v.ii.xix-Page_111b"></span>astonished that
neither his former conversation, nor his advanced age, nor his
long-continued sickness, could turn your mind from wrath.  For, whatever
his transgression may have been, the very affliction of sickness ought
to have sufficed as a scourge for him.  For to one crushed by divine
discipline it was superfluous to add human scourges.  But perhaps thou
hast been allowed to exceed in the case of such a person, in order that
thou mightest become more cautious in the case of others of less
account, and ponder long when thou art disposed to smite any one through
a sentence.  Yet still comfort this same man with a sweetness
proportionate to the fury with which thou hast exasperated him, since it
is very unjust that the very persons who have loved thee most should
find thee without cause most bitter against themselves.
