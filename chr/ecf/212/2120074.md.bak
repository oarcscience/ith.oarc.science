<span id="ii.iv.lxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter LXIX.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.lxiv-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.lxiv-p2.1"></span>(To Theodosius Augustus.)</span>

<span id="ii.iv.lxiv-p3"></span>Leo, the bishop, to Theodosius ever
Augustus.

<span id="ii.iv.lxiv-p4"></span>I.  *He suspends his opinion on the
appointment of Anatolius till he has made open confession of the
catholic Faith.*

<span id="ii.iv.lxiv-p5"></span>In all your piously expressed letters
amid the anxieties, which we suffer for the Faith, you have afforded us
hope of security by supporting the Council of Nicæa so loyally as not to
allow the priests of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxiv-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> to budge from it, as you have
often written us already.  But lest I should seem to have done anything
prejudicial to the catholic defence, I thought nothing rash on either
side ought meanwhile to be written back on the ordination of him who has
begun to preside over the church of Constantinople, and this not through
want of loving interest, but waiting for the catholic Truth to be made
clear.  And I beg your clemency to bear this with equanimity that when
he has proved himself such as we desire towards the catholic Faith, we
may the more fully and safely rejoice over his sincerity.  But that no
evil suspicion may assail him about our disposition towards him, I
remove all occasion of difficulty, and demand nothing which may seem
either hard or controvertible but make an invitation which no catholic
would decline.  For they are well known and renowned throughout the
world, who before our time have shone in preaching the catholic Truth
whether in the Greek or the Latin tongue, to whose learning and teaching
some even of our own day have recourse, and from whose writings a
uniform and manifold statement of doctrine is produced:  which, as it
has pulled down the heresy of Nestorius, so has it cut off this error
too which is now sprouting out again.  Let him then read again what is
the belief on the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxiv-p5.2"></span>Lord’s</span> Incarnation which the holy
fathers guarded and has always been similarly preached, and when he has
perceived that the letter of Cyril of holy memory, bishop of Alexandria,
agrees with the view of those who preceded him \[wherein he wished to
correct and cure Nestorius, refuting his wrong statements and setting
out more clearly the Faith as defined at Nicæa, and which was sent by
him and placed in the library of the Apostolic See <span
id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md) \], let him further reconsider the
proceedings of the Ephesian Synod <span
id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md) wherein the testimonies of catholic
priests on the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxiv-p7.1"></span>Lord’s</span> Incarnation are inserted and
maintained by Cyril of holy memory.  Let him not scorn also to read my
letter <span id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md) over, which he will find
to agree throughout with the pious belief of the fathers.  And when he
has realized that that is required and desired from him which shall
serve the same good end, let him give his hearty assent to the judgment
of the catholics, so that in the presence of all the clergy and the
whole people he may without any reservation declare his sincere
acknowledgment of the common Faith, to be communicated to the Apostolic
See and all the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxiv-p8.1"></span>Lord’s</span> priests and churches, and thus
the world being at peace through the one Faith, we may all be able to
say what the angels sang at the Saviour’s birth of the Virgin Mary,
“Glory in the highest to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxiv-p8.2"></span>God</span> and on earth peace to men of good
will <span id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) .”

<span id="ii.iv.lxiv-p10"></span>II.  *He promises to accept Anatolius
on making this confession, and asks for a council in Italy to finally
define the Faith.*

<span id="ii.iv.lxiv-p11"></span>But because both we and our blessed
fathers, whose teaching we revere and follow, are in concord on the one
Faith, as the bishops of all the provinces attest, let your clemency’s
most devout faith see to it that such a document as is due may reach us
as soon as may be from the bishop of Constantinople, as from an approved
and catholic priest, that is, openly and distinctly affirming that he
will separate from his communion any one who believes or maintains any
other view about the Incarnation of the Word of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxiv-p11.1"></span>God</span> than my statement and that of
all catholics lays down, that we may fairly be able to bestow on him
brotherly love in Christ.  And that swifter and fuller effect, <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.lxiv-p11.2"></span>God</span> aiding us, may
be given through your clemency’s faith to our wholesome desires, I have
sent to your piety my brethren and fellow-bishops Abundius and Asterius,
together with Basilius and Senator presbyters, whose devotion is well
proved to me, through whom, when they have displayed the instructions
which we have sent, you may be able properly to apprehend what is the
standard of our faith, so that, if the bishop of Constantinople gives
his hearty assent to the same confession, we may securely, as is due,
rejoice over the peace of the Church and no <span id="page_64">p.
64</span> <span id="ii.iv.lxiv-Page_64"></span>ambiguity may seem to
lurk behind which may trouble us with perhaps ungrounded suspicions. 
But if any dissent from the purity of our Faith and from the authority
of the Fathers, the Synod which has met at Rome for that purpose joins
with me in asking your clemency to permit a universal council within the
limits of Italy; so that, if all those come together in one place who
have fallen either through ignorance or through fear, measures may be
taken to correct and cure them, and no one any longer may be allowed to
quote the Synod of Nicæa in a way which shall prove him opposed to its
Faith; since it will be of advantage both to the whole Church and to
your rule, if one <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxiv-p11.3"></span>God</span>, one Faith and one mystery of
man’s Salvation, be held by the one confession of the whole world.

<span id="ii.iv.lxiv-p12"></span>Dated 17th July in the consulship of
the illustrious Valentinianus for the seventh time) and Avienus (450).
