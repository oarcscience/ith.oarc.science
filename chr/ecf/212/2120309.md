<span id="iii.v.i.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.vii-p1.1"></span>Epistle VII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.vii-p2"></span>*To Anastasius, Patriarch of
Antioch* <span id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309) .

<span id="iii.v.i.vii-p4"></span>Gregory to Anastasius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.vii-p5"></span>I have found what your Blessedness has
written to be as rest to the weary, as health to the sick, as a fountain
to the thirsty, as shade to the oppressed with heat.  For those words of
yours did not seem even to be expressed by the tongue of the flesh,
inasmuch as you so disclosed the spiritual love which you bear me as if
your soul itself were speaking.  But very hard was that which followed,
in that your love enjoined me to bear earthly burdens, and that, having
first loved me spiritually, you <span id="page_77b">p. 77b</span> <span
id="iii.v.i.vii-Page_77b"></span>afterwards, loving me as I think in
temporal wise, pressed me down to the ground with the burden you laid
upon me; so that, losing utterly all uprightness of soul, and forfeiting
the keen vision of contemplation, I may say, not in the spirit of
prophecy, but from experience, *I am bowed down and brought low
altogether* ([Psa. 119.107](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#107)<span
id="iii.v.i.vii-p5.1"></span> <span id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310)
).  For indeed such great burdens of business press me down that my mind
can in no wise lift itself up to heavenly things.  I am tossed by the
billows of a multitude of affairs, and, after the ease of my former
quiet, am afflicted by the storms of a tumultuous life, so that I may
truly say, *I am come into the depth of the sea, and the storm hath
overwhelmed me* ([Psa. 69.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002)<span
id="iii.v.i.vii-p6.1"></span> <span id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311)
).  Stretch out, therefore, the hand of your prayer to me in my danger,
you that stand on the shore of virtue.  But as to your calling me the
mouth and the lantern of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.vii-p7.1"></span>Lord</span>, and alleging that I profit
many, this also adds to the load of my iniquities, that, when my
iniquity ought to have been chastised, I receive praises instead of
chastisement.  But with what a bustle of earthly business I am
distracted in this place, I cannot express in words; yet you can gather
it from the shortness of this letter, in which I say so little to him
who I love above all others.  Further, I apprize you that I have
requested our most serene lords with all possible urgency to allow you
to come to the threshold of Peter, the prince of the apostles, with your
dignity restored to you, and to live here with me so long as it may
please <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.vii-p7.2"></span>God</span>;
to the end that, as long as I am accounted worthy of seeing you, we may
relieve the weariness of our pilgrimage by speaking to each other of the
heavenly country.

id="iii.v.i.vii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i.vii-p3"></span> Anastasius had been threatened with
deposition and exile (<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.vii-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 563) by the Emperor Justinian,
and the sentence had been carried into effect (<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.vii-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 570) by Justinian’s successor,
Justin II.  Notwithstanding this, Gregory after his own accession
acknowledged him as the true patriarch of Antioch; and, probably owing
to his intercession with the Emperor Maurice, Anastasius was restored to
his patriarchal See on the death of Gregory, who had been intruded into
it, <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.vii-p3.3"></span>a.d.</span>
593.  Other Epistles to, or concerning this Anastasius are I. 25, 26,
28; V. 39; VII. 27, 33; VIII. 2.
