<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p2"></span>To Narses the Patrician.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p3"></span>Gregory to Narses, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p4"></span>Your most sweet Charity has said much
to me in your letters in praise of my good deeds, to all which I briefly
reply, *Call me not Noemi, that is beautiful; but call me Mara, that is
bitter; for I am full of bitterness* ([Ruth i.
20](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p4.1"></span>).

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p5"></span>But as to the cause of the
presbyters <span id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md) , which is pending
with my brother and fellow-bishop, the most reverend Patriarch John, we
have, as I think, for our adversary the very man whom you assert to be
desirous of observing the canons.  Further, I declare to thy Charity
that I am prepared, with the help of Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p6.1"></span>God</span>, to prosecute this same cause
with all my power and influence.  And, should I see that in it the
canons of the Apostolic See are not observed, Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p6.2"></span>God</span> will give
unto me what I may do against the contemners of the same.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p7"></span>As to what your Charity has written
to me, asking me to give thanks for you to my son the chief physician
and ex-præfect Theodorus, I have done so, and have by no means ceased to
commend you as much as I could.  Further, I beg you to pardon me for
replying to your letters with brevity; for I am pressed by such great
tribulations that it is not allowed me either to read or to speak much
by letter.  This only I say to thee, *For the voice of groaning I have
forgotten to eat my bread* ([Psa.
102.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p7.1"></span> <span
id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555) .md).  All that are with you I beg you
to salute in my name.  Give my salutations to the lady Dominica, whose
letter I have not answered, because, though she is Latin, she wrote to
me in Greek.
