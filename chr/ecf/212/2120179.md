<span id="ii.v.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="ii.v.i-p3"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.i-p3.1"></span>Sermon I.</span>

<span id="ii.v.i-p4"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.i-p4.1"></span>Preached on his Birthday <span
id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) , or day of Ordination.</span>

<span id="ii.v.i-p6"></span>*Having been elected in absence* <span
id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) *he returns thanks for the kindness
and earnestly demands the prayers of his church.*

<span id="ii.v.i-p8"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i-p8.1"></span>Let</span> my mouth speak the praise of the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.i-p8.2"></span>Lord <span
id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) </span>,” and my breath and spirit, my
flesh and tongue bless His holy Name.  For it is a sign, not of a
modest, but an ungrateful mind, to keep silence on the kindnesses of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.i-p9.2"></span>God</span>:  and it is
very meet to begin our duty as consecrated pontiff with the sacrifices
of the <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.i-p9.3"></span>Lord’s</span>
praise <span id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md) .  Because “in our
humility” the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i-p10.1"></span>Lord</span> “has been mindful of us <span
id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md) ” and has blessed us:  because “He
alone has done great wonders for me <span
id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md) ,” so that your holy affection for me
reckoned me present, though my long journey had forced me to be absent. 
Therefore I give and always shall give thanks to our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.i-p12.2"></span>God</span> for all the things
with which He has recompensed me.  Your favourable opinion also I
acknowledge publicly, paying you the thanks I owe, and thus showing that
I understand how much respect, love and fidelity your affectionate zeal
could expend on me who long with a shepherd’s anxiety for the safety of
your souls, who have passed so conscientious a judgment on me, with
absolutely no deserts of mine to guide you.  I entreat you, therefore,
by the mercies of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i-p12.3"></span>Lord</span>, aid with your prayers him whom you
have sought out by your solicitations that both the Spirit of grace may
abide in me and that your judgment may not change.  May He who inspired
you with such unanimity of purpose, vouchsafe to us all in common the
blessing of peace:  so that all the days of my life being ready for the
service of Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i-p12.4"></span>God</span>, and for my duties towards you, I
may with confidence entreat the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i-p12.5"></span>Lord</span>:  “Holy Father, keep in Thy name
those whom Thou hast given me <span id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md)
:”  and while you ever go on unto salvation, may “my soul magnify the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.i-p13.2"></span>Lord <span
id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) </span>,” and in the retribution of
the judgment to come may the account of my priesthood so be rendered to
the just Judge <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) that through your
good deeds you may be my joy and my crown, who by your good will have
given an earnest testimony to me in this present life.

<span id="ii.v.i-p5"></span> *Natalis* seems to have been applied to the
day or anniversary of a Bishop’s consecration as well as to the
festivals of Martyrs in the Calendar.  Cf. Serm. IV. chap. 4, *illi ergo
hunc servitutis nostræ natalitium diem ascribamus*.  One reason for the
shortness of this sermon, which used to be joined with Sermon II. (a few
necessary alterations in the text of the latter being made) is, I think,
rightly given by the Ballerinii:  “perhaps” they say, “the unusual
length of the ceremonies that day did not allow of a longer sermon.”
