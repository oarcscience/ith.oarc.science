<span id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-Page_134b"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p2"></span>*To Columbus, Bishop* <span
id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md) .

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p4"></span>Gregory to Columbus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p5"></span>Even before receiving thy
Fraternity’s letter, I knew thee from the report of thy deserved
reputation to be a good servant of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p5.1"></span>God</span>.  And now that I have
received it, I understand more fully that what fame had already spread
abroad was well founded; and I greatly rejoice in thy deserts, in that
thou exhibitest manners and deeds that testify to a praiseworthy life. 
Since, then, I feel that these things are conferred on thee by the
Supernal Majesty, I congratulate thee; and I bless <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p5.2"></span>God</span> our
Creditor, who denies not the gifts of His mercy to His humble servants. 
On this account I declare it to be true that thy Fraternity so kindles
me with the flame of charity to love thee, and my spirit is so united to
thee, that I both desire to see thee and am also with thee in heart,
though absent.  Thou perceivest in thine own thoughts that this is so. 
For in truth unity of minds in charity has power to unite more than
bodily presence can.  Furthermore, that with thy whole mind, thy whole
heart, thy whole soul, thou cleavest and art devoted to the Apostolic
See I am now assured, as, indeed before thy letter had borne testimony
to the fact, I plainly knew.  Wherefore, first addressing thee with the
greeting of charity which is due, I exhort thee not to cease to be
mindful of what thou hast promised to the blessed Peter, Prince of the
apostles.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p6"></span>Wherefore be thou urgent with the
primate of thy synod <span id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md) , that
boys be in no wise admitted to sacred orders, lest they fall by so much
the more dangerously as they hasten more speedily to mount to higher
places.  Let there be no venality in ordination:  let not the influence
or entreaty of any persons obtain anything in contravention of these our
prohibitions.  For without doubt <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p7.1"></span>God</span> is offended if any one is
promoted to sacred orders, not for merit, but by favour (which <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p7.2"></span>God</span> forbid) or
venality.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p8"></span>If, then, thou art aware of these
things being done, keep not silence, but oppose them urgently; since, if
perchance thou shouldest neglect them, or conceal them when known of,
the chain of sin will bind not those alone who do such things, but no
light guilt before <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p8.1"></span>God</span> will touch thee also in the
matter.  If, then, anything of the kind is committed, it ought to be
restrained by canonical punishment, lest so great a wickedness, with sin
in others, acquire strength from connivance.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p9"></span>I have, therefore, the sooner given
leave of departure to the bearer of these presents, Victorinus, thy
Fraternity’s deacon, whom I think to be thy imitator, and whom I have
received with charity; and by him I have transmitted to thee for a
blessing keys of the blessed Peter, in which something from his chains
is included.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p10"></span>Lastly, with regard to the unity
and peace of the council which, under <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p10.1"></span>God</span>, you are taking measures to
assemble, let thy Charity rejoice my mind by informing me of everything
particularly.
