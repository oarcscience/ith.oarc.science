<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p2"></span>How those are to be admonished with
whom everything succeeds according to their wish, and those with whom
nothing does.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p3"></span>(*Admonition* 27.)  Differently to
be admonished are those who prosper in what they desire in temporal
matters, and those who covet indeed the things that are of this world,
<span id="page_55b">p. 55b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-Page_55b"></span>but yet are wearied with the labour
of adversity.  For those who prosper in what they desire in temporal
matters are to be admonished, when all things answer to their wishes,
lest, through fixing their heart on what is given, they neglect to seek
the giver; lest they love their pilgrimage instead of their country;
lest they turn the supplies for their journey into hindrances to their
arrival at its end; lest, delighted with the light of the moon by night,
they shrink from beholding the clearness of the sun.  They are,
therefore, to be admonished to regard whatever things they attain in
this world as consolations in calamity, but not as the rewards of
retribution; but, on the other hand, to lift their mind against the
favours of the world, lest they succumb in the midst of them with entire
delight of the heart.  For whosoever in the judgment of his heart keeps
not down the prosperity he enjoys by love of a better life, turns the
favours of this transitory life into an occasion of everlasting death. 
For hence it is that under the figure of the Idumæans, who allowed
themselves to be vanquished by their own prosperity, those who rejoice
in the successes of this world are rebuked, when it is said, *They have
given my land to themselves for an inheritance with joy, and with their
whole heart and mind* ([Ezek. xxxvi.
5](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p3.1"></span>).  In which words it is to be
observed, that they are smitten with severe rebuke, not merely because
they rejoice, but because they rejoice with their whole heart and mind. 
Hence Solomon says, *The turning away of the simple shall slay them, and
the prosperity of fools shall destroy them* ([Prov. i.
32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p3.2"></span>).  Hence Paul admonishes, saying,
*They that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use this
world, as though they used it not* ([1 Cor. vii.
30](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p3.3"></span>).  So may the things that are supplied
to us be of service to us outwardly to such extent only as not to turn
our minds away from desire of supernal delight; and thus the things that
afford us succour in our state of exile may not abate the mourning of
our soul’s pilgrimage; and we, who see ourselves to be wretched in our
severance from the things that are eternal, may not rejoice as though we
were happy in the things that are transitory.  For hence it is that the
Church says by the voice of the elect, *His left hand is under my head,
and his right hand shall embrace me* ([Song of Sol.
2.6](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p3.4"></span>).  The left hand of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p3.5"></span>God</span>, to wit
prosperity in the present life, she has put under her head, in that she
presses it down in the intentness of her highest love.  But the right
hand of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p3.6"></span>God</span> embraces her, because in her
entire devotion she is encompassed with His eternal blessedness.  Hence
again, it is said through Solomon, *Length of days is in her right hand,
but in her left hand riches and glory* ([Prov. iii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p3.7"></span>).  In speaking, then, of riches and
glory being placed in her left hand, he shewed after what manner they
are to be esteemed.  Hence the Psalmist says, *Save me with thy right
hand* ([Psa. 108.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p3.8"></span> <span
id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284) .md).  For he says not, *with thy
hand*, but *with thy right hand;* in order, that is, to indicate, in
saying *right hand*, that it was eternal salvation that he sought. 
Hence again it is written, *Thy right hand, O <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p4.1"></span>Lord</span>, hath dashed in pieces the
enemies* ([Exod. xv. 6](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p4.2"></span>).  For the enemies of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p4.3"></span>God</span>, though
they prosper in His left hand, are dashed to pieces with His right;
since for the most part the present life elevates the bad, but the
coming of eternal blessedness condemns them.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p5"></span>Those who prosper in this world are
to be admonished to consider wisely how that prosperity in the present
life is sometimes given to provoke people to a better life, but
sometimes to condemn them more fully for ever.  For hence it is that to
the people of Israel the land of Canaan is promised, that they may be
provoked at some time or other to hope for eternal things.  For that
rude nation would not have believed the promises of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p5.1"></span>God</span> afar off,
had they not received also something nigh at hand from Him that
promised.  In order, therefore, that they may be the more surely
strengthened unto faith in eternal things, they are drawn on, not only
by hope to realities, but also by realities to hope.  Which thing the
Psalmist clearly testifies, saying, *He gave them the lands of the
heathen, and they took the labours of the peoples in possession, that
they might keep his statutes and seek after his law* ([Psa.
105.44](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#044.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p5.2"></span> <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285) .md).  But, when the human mind
follows not <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p6.1"></span>God</span> in His bountiful gifts with
an answer of good deeds, it is the more justly condemned from being
accounted to have been kindly nurtured.  For hence it is said again by
the Psalmist, *Thou castedst them down when they were lifted up* ([Psa.
73.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p6.2"></span> <span
id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286) .md).  For in truth when the reprobate
render not righteous deeds in return for divine gifts, when they here
abandon themselves entirely and sink themselves in their abundant
prosperity, then in that whereby they profit outwardly they fall from
what is inmost.  Hence it is that to the rich man tormented in hell it
is said, *Thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things* ([Luke xvi.
25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p7.1"></span>).  For on this account, though an evil
man, he here received good things, that there he might receive evil
things <span id="page_56b">p. 56b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-Page_56b"></span>more fully, because here even by
good things he had not been converted.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p8"></span>But, on the other hand, those who
covet indeed the things that are of the world, but yet are wearied by
the labour of adversity, are to be admonished to consider anxiously with
how great favour the Creator and Disposer of all things watches over
those whom He gives not up to their own desires.  For a sick man whom
the physician despairs of he allows to take whatever he longs for:  but
one of whom it is thought that he can be cured is prohibited from many
things that he desires; and we withdraw money from boys, for whom at the
same time, as our heirs, we reserve our whole patrimony.  Let, then,
those whom temporal adversity humiliates take joy from hope of an
eternal inheritance, since Divine Providence would not curb them in
order to educate them under the rule of discipline, unless it designed
them to be saved for ever.  Those, therefore, who in respect of the
temporal things which they covet, are wearied with the labour of
adversity are to be admonished to consider carefully how for the most
part even the righteous, when temporal power exalts them, are caught by
sin as in a snare.  For, as in the former part of this volume we have
already said, David, beloved of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p8.1"></span>God</span>, was more upright when in
servitude than when he came to the kingdom ([1 Sam. xxiv.
18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p8.2"></span>).  For, when he was a servant, in his
love of righteousness he feared to smite his adversary when taken; but,
when he was a king, through the persuasion of lasciviousness, he put to
death by a deceitful plan even a devoted soldier ([2 Sam. xi.
17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p8.3"></span>).  Who then can without harm seek
wealth, or power, or glory, if they proved harmful even to him who had
them unsought?  Who in the midst of these things shall be saved without
the labour of a great contest, if he who had been prepared for them by
the choice of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvii-p8.4"></span>God</span> was disturbed among them by
the intervention of sin?  They are to be admonished to consider that
Solomon, who after so great wisdom is described as having fallen even
into idolatry, is not said to have had any adversity in this world
before his fall; but the wisdom that had been granted him entirely left
his heart, because not even the least discipline of tribulation had
guarded it.
