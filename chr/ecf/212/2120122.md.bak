<span id="ii.iv.cxii"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.cxii-p1.1"></span>Letter CXVII.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.cxii-p2.1"></span>To Julian, Bishop of Cos.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p3"></span>Leo to Julian the bishop.

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p4"></span>I.  *He wishes his assent to the acts of
Chalcedon to be widely known.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p5"></span>How watchfully and how devotedly you
guard the catholic Faith, brother, the tenor of your letter shows, and
my anxiety is greatly relieved by the information it contains;
supplemented as it is by the most religious piety of our religious
Emperor, which is clearly shown to be prepared by the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxii-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> for the
confirmation of the whole Church; so that, whilst Christian princes act
for the Faith with holy zeal, the priests of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxii-p5.2"></span>Lord</span> may confidently pray for their
realm.

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p6"></span>What therefore our most clement Emperor
deemed needful I have willingly complied with, by sending letters to all
the brethren who were present at the Synod of Chalcedon, in which to
show that I approved of what was resolved upon by our holy brethren
about the Rule of Faith; on their account to wit, who in order to cloke
their own treachery, pretend to consider invalid or doubtful such
conciliar ordinances as are not ratified by my assent:  albeit, after
the return of the brethren whom I had sent in my stead, I dispatched a
letter to the bishop of Constantinople; so that, if he had been minded
to publish it, abundant proof might have been furnished thereby how
gladly I approved of what the synod had passed concerning the Faith. 
But, because it contained such an answer as would have run counter to
his self-seeking, he preferred my acceptance of the brethren’s
resolutions to remain unknown, lest at the same time my reply should
become known on the absolute authority of the Nicene canons.  Wherefore
take heed, beloved, that you warn our most gracious prince by frequent
reminders that he add his words to ours and order the letter of the
Apostolic See to be sent round to the priests of each single province,
that hereafter no enemy of the Truth may venture to excuse himself under
cover of my silence.

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p7"></span>II.  *He expresses his thanks for the
zeal shown by the Emperor and the Empress.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p8"></span>And as to the edict of the most
Christian Emperor, in which he has shown what the ignorant folly of
certain monks deserved and as to the reply of the most gracious Augusta,
in which she rebuked the heads of the monasteries, I wish my great
rejoicing to be known, being assured that this fervour of faith is
bestowed upon them by Divine inspiration, in order that all men may
acknowledge their superiority to rest not only on their royal state but
also on their priestly holiness:  whom both now and formerly I have
asked to treat you with full confidence, being assured of their good
will, and that they will not refuse to give ear to necessary
suggestions.

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p9"></span>III.  *He wishes to know the effect of
his letter to the Empress Eudocia.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p10"></span>And, because the most clement Emperor
has been pleased to charge me secretly by our son Paulus with the task
of admonishing our daughter the most clement Augusta Eudocia <span
id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md) , I have done what he wished, in order
that from my letter she may learn how profitable it will be to her if
she espouses the cause of the catholic Faith, and have managed that she
should further be admonished by a letter from that most clement prince
her son; nothing doubting that she herself, too, will set to work with
pious zeal to bring the leaders of sedition to a knowledge of the
consequences of their action, and, if they understand not the utterances
of those who teach them, to make them at least afraid of the powers of
those who will punish them.  And so what effect this care of ours
produces, I wish to know at once by a letter from you, beloved, and
whether their ignorant contumacy has at length subsided:  as to which if
they think there is any doubt about our teaching, let them at least not
reject the writings of such holy priests as <span id="page_85">p.
85</span> <span id="ii.iv.cxii-Page_85"></span>Athanasius, Theophilus
and Cyril of Alexandria, with whom our statement of the Faith so
completely harmonizes that any one who professes consent to them
disagrees in nothing with us.

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p12"></span>IV.  *Aetius must be content at present
with the Emperor’s favour.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p13"></span>With our son Aetius <span
id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md) the presbyter we sympathize in his
sorrow; and, as one has been put into his place who had previously been
judged worthy of censure, there is no doubt that this change tends to
the injury of catholics.  But these things must be borne patiently
meanwhile, lest we should be thought to exceed the measure of our usual
moderation, and for the present Aetius must be content with the
encouragement of our most clement prince’s favour, to whom I have but
lately so commended him by letter that I doubt not his good repute has
been increased in their most religious minds.

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p15"></span>V.  *Anatolius shows no contrition in
his subsequent acts.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxii-p16"></span>This too we would have you know, that
bishop Anatolius after our prohibition so persisted in his rash
presumption as to call upon the bishops of Illyricum to subscribe their
names:  this news was brought us by the bishop who was sent by the
bishop of Thessalonica <span id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) to
announce his consecration.  We have declined to write to Anatolius about
this, although you might have expected us to do so, because we perceived
he did not wish to be reformed.  I have made two versions of my letter
to the Synod, one with a copy of my letter to Anatolius subjoined, one
without it; leaving it to your judgment to deliver the one which you
think ought to be given to our most clement prince and to keep the
other.  Dated 21st March, in the consulship of the illustrious Opilio
(453).
