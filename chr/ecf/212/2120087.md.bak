<span id="ii.iv.lxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.lxxvii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXII.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.lxxvii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.lxxvii-p2.1"></span>To Marcian Augustus.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.lxxvii-p3"></span>I.  *After congratulating the Emperor
on his noble conduct, he deprecates random inquiries into the tenets of
the Faith.*

<span id="ii.iv.lxxvii-p4"></span>Although I have replied <span
id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md) already to your Grace by the hand of
the Constantinopolitan clergy, yet on receiving your clemency’s mercy
through the illustrious prefect of the <span id="page_67">p. 67</span>
<span id="ii.iv.lxxvii-Page_67"></span>city, my son Tatian, I found
still greater cause for congratulation, because I have learnt your
strong eagerness for the Church’s peace.  And this holy desire as in
fairness it deserves, secures for your empire the same happy condition
as you seek for religion.  For when the Spirit of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxxvii-p5.1"></span>God</span> establishes harmony among
Christian princes, a twofold confidence is produced throughout the
world, because the progress of love and faith makes the power of their
arms in both directions unconquerable, so that <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxxvii-p5.2"></span>God</span> being propitiated by one
confession, the falseness of heretics and the enmity of barbarians are
simultaneously overthrown, most glorious Emperor.  The hope, therefore,
of heavenly aid being increased through the Emperor’s friendship, I
venture with the greater confidence to appeal to your Grace on behalf of
the mystery of man’s salvation, not to allow any one in vain and
presumptuous craftiness to inquire what must be held, as if it were
uncertain.  And although we may not in a single word dissent from the
teaching of the Gospels and Apostles, nor entertain any opinion on the
Divine Scriptures different to what the blessed Apostles and our Fathers
learnt and taught, now in these latter days unlearned and blasphemous
inquiries are set on foot, which of old the Holy Spirit crushed by the
disciples of the Truth, so soon as the devil aroused them in hearts
which were suited to his purpose.

<span id="ii.iv.lxxvii-p6"></span>II.  *The points to be settled are
only which of the lapsed shall be restored, and on what terms.*

<span id="ii.iv.lxxvii-p7"></span>But it is most inopportune that
through the foolishness of a few we should be brought once more into
hazardous opinions, and to the warfare of carnal disputes, as if the
wrangle was to be revived, and we had to settle whether Eutyches held
blasphemous views, and whether Dioscorus gave wrong judgment, who in
condemning Flavian of holy memory struck his own death-blow, and
involved the simpler folk in the same destruction.  And now that many,
as we have ascertained, have betaken themselves to the means of
amendment, and entreat forgiveness for their weak hastiness, we have to
determine not the character of the Faith, but whose prayers we shall
receive, and on what terms.  And hence that most religious anxiety which
you deign to feel for the proclamation of a Synod, shall have fully and
timely put before it all that I judge pertinent to the needs of the
case, by means of the deputies who will with all speed, if <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.lxxvii-p7.1"></span>God</span> permit, reach
your Grace.  Dated the 23rd of April in the consulship of the
illustrious Adelfius (451).
