id="iii.v.viii.xii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.xii-p2"></span>To Marinianus, Bishop of Ravenna.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xii-p3"></span>Gregory to Marinianus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xii-p4"></span>John, the bearer of these presents,
complains that his wife, flying from the molestations of one George, has
long been residing within venerable precincts <span
id="fr_1741"></span>[1742](#fn_1741.md) , and has so far met with no
assistance.  Since she asserts that there is a dispute about her
condition <span id="fr_1742"></span>[1743](#fn_1742.md) , and has asked
that it should be commended to your Fraternity, we hereby exhort you
that you afford your protection to this woman, and permit her not to be
in any way aggrieved by any one unreasonably.  But if the question about
her station still continues, let it be your care that, without any
oppression, and in a legal manner, it may be submitted for judgment; so
that when, after ascertainment of the truth, what is agreeable to the
order of law has been determined, neither party may complain of having
suffered wrong.  The month of May, first Indiction.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xii-p5"></span> The woman had fled to the precincts
of some church for protection from one George, who apparently claimed
her as his slave.  The right of temporary asylum in sacred precincts,
from which refugees could not be taken without the bishop’s assent,
rested on imperial edicts.  “Vide lib. I. Cod., tit. 12, cap. 3, ubi
imperatores Theodosius et Valentianus plurima de septis ecclesiasticis
statuunt.…Vocantur etiam *claustra dominica*, et continent atria et
porticus ecclesiæ, domum episcopi, xxx vel xl passus in circuitu, et
domus quæ iu eis fuerint.  Tandem cessavit ista immunitas ob abusus.” 
(Note to I. 37 in Migne’s *Patrilogia*).  Cf. X. 37, where directions
are given to Januarius, bishop of Cagliari, for his course of action in
such cases.

free-woman or a slave.
