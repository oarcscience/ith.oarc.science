<span id="iii.v.ii.xxiii-p2"></span>To Luminosus, Abbot.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxiii-p3"></span>Gregory to Luminosus, abbot of the
monastery of Saint Thomas of Ariminum.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxiii-p4"></span>We were glad to receive thine own
and thy congregation’s petition, and accede to thy requests, in
accordance with the statutes of the Fathers and with form of law.  For
to our brother and fellow-bishop Castorius a letter has been sent by our
order, whereby we have taken away entirely from him and his successors
all power to harm thy monastery; so that neither may he any longer come
among you to be a burden to you, nor schedules be made of the property
of the monastery, nor any public procession <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) take place there; this only
jurisdiction being still left to him, that he must ordain in the place
of a deceased abbot another whom the common consent of the congregation
may have chosen as worthy.  But now, these things being thus
accomplished, be you diligent in the work of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xxiii-p5.1"></span>God</span>, and assiduously devote
yourselves to prayer, lest you should seem not so much to have sought
security of mind for prayer, as to have wished to escape strict
episcopal control over you while living amiss.
