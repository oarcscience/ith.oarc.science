<span id="ii.v.xx"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xx-p1.1"></span>Sermon XXXVI.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xx-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xx-p2.1"></span>On the Feast of the Epiphany, VI.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xx-p3"></span>I.  *The story of the magi not only a
byegone fact in history, but of everyday application to ourselves.*

<span id="ii.v.xx-p4"></span>The day, dearly-beloved, on which Christ
the Saviour of the world first appeared to the nations must be venerated
by us with holy worship:  and to-day those joys must be entertained in
our hearts which existed in the breasts of the three magi, when, aroused
by the sign and leading of a new star, which they believed to have been
promised, they fell down in presence of the King of heaven and earth. 
For that day has not so passed away that the mighty work, which was then
revealed, has passed away with it, and that nothing but the report of
the thing has come down to us for faith to receive and memory to
celebrate; seeing that, by the oft-repeated gift of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xx-p4.1"></span>God</span>, our times daily
enjoy the fruit of what the first age possessed.  And therefore,
although the narrative which is read to us from the Gospel <span
id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893.md) properly records those days on which
the three men, who had neither been taught by the prophets’ predictions
nor instructed by the testimony of the law, came to acknowledge <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xx-p5.1"></span>God</span> from the furthest
parts of the East, yet we behold this same thing more clearly and
abundantly carried on now in the enlightenment of all those who are
called, since the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled when he says, “the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xx-p5.2"></span>Lord</span> has laid
bare His holy arm in the sight of all the nations, and all the nations
upon earth have seen the salvation which is from the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xx-p5.3"></span>Lord</span> our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xx-p5.4"></span>God</span>;” and again, “and
those to whom it has not been announced about Him shall see, and they
who have not heard, shall understand <span
id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894.md) .”  Hence when we see men devoted to
worldly wisdom and far from belief in Jesus Christ brought out of the
depth of their error and called to an acknowledgment of the true Light,
it is undoubtedly the brightness of the Divine grace that is at work: 
and whatever of new light illumines the darkness of their hearts, comes
from the rays of the same star:  so that it should both move with
wonder, and going before lead to the adoration of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xx-p6.2"></span>God</span> the minds which it visited with its
splendour.  But if with careful thought we wish to see how their
threefold kind of gift is also offered by all who come to Christ with
the foot of faith, is not the same offering repeated in the hearts of
true believers?  For he that acknowledges Christ the King of the
universe brings gold from the treasure of his heart:  he that believes
the Only-begotten of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xx-p6.3"></span>God</span> to have united man’s true nature to
Himself, offers myrrh; and he that confesses Him in no wise inferior to
the Father’s majesty, worships Him in a manner with incense.

<span id="ii.v.xx-p7"></span>II.  *Satan still carries on the wiles of
Herod, and, as it were, personates him in his opposition to Christ.*

<span id="ii.v.xx-p8"></span>These comparisons, dearly-beloved, being
thoughtfully considered, we find Herod’s character also not to be
wanting, of which the devil himself is now an unwearied imitator, just
as he was then a secret instigator.  For he is tortured at the calling
of all the nations, and racked at the daily destruction of his power,
grieving at his being everywhere deserted, and the true King adored in
all places.  He prepares devices, he hatches plots, he bursts out into
murders, and that he may make use of the remnants of those whom he still
deceives, is consumed with envy in the persons of the Jews, lies
treacherously in wait in the persons of heretics, blazes out into
cruelty in the persons of the heathen.  For he sees that <span
id="page_151">p. 151</span> <span id="ii.v.xx-Page_151"></span>the power
of the eternal King is invincible Whose death has extinguished the power
of death itself; and therefore he has armed himself with all his skill
of injury against those who serve the true King; hardening some by the
pride that knowledge of the law engenders, debasing others by the lies
of false belief, and inciting others to the madness of persecution.  Yet
the madness of this “Herod” is vanquished, and brought to nought by Him
who has crowned even infants with the glory of martyrdom, and has endued
His faithful ones with so unconquerable a love that in the Apostle’s
words they dare to say, “who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
shall tribulation, or want, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or
peril, or the sword? as it is written, For thy sake are we killed all
the day long, we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.  But in all
these things we overcome on account of Him who loved us <span
id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895.md) .”

<span id="ii.v.xx-p10"></span>III.  *The cessation of active persecution
does not do away with the need of continued vigilance:  Satan has only
changed his tactics.*

<span id="ii.v.xx-p11"></span>Such courage as this, dearly-beloved, we
do not believe to have been needful only at those times in which the
kings of the world and all the powers of the age were raging against
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xx-p11.1"></span>God’s</span> people in
an outburst of wickedness, thinking it to redound to their greatest
glory if they removed the Christian name from the earth, but not knowing
that <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xx-p11.2"></span>God’s</span>
Church grows through the frenzy of their cruelty, since in the tortures
and deaths of the martyrs, those whose number was reckoned to be
diminished were augmented through the force of example <span
id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896.md) .  In fine, so much strength has our
Faith gained by the attacks of persecutors that royal princedoms have no
greater ornament than that the lords of the world are members of Christ;
and their boast is not so much that they were born in the purple as that
they have been re-born in baptism.  But because the stress of former
blasts has lulled, and with a cessation of fightings a measure of
tranquillity has long seemed to smile upon us, those divergences are
carefully to be guarded against which arise from the very reign of
peace.  For the adversary having been proved ineffective in open
persecutions now exercises a hidden skill in doing cruel hurt, in order
to overthrow by the stumbling-block of pleasure those whom he could not
strike with the blow of affliction.  And so seeing the faith of princes
opposed to him and the indivisible Trinity of the one Godhead as
devoutly worshipped in palaces as in churches, he grieves at the
shedding of Christian blood being forbidden, and attacks the mode of
life of those whose death he cannot compass.  The terror of
confiscations he changes into the fire of avarice, and corrupts with
covetousness those whose spirit he could not break by losses.  For the
malicious haughtiness which long use has ingrained into his very nature
has not laid aside its hatred, but changed its character in order to
subjugate the minds of the faithful by blandishments.  He inflames those
with covetous desires whom he cannot distress with tortures:  he sows
strifes, kindles passions, sets tongues a-wagging, and, lest more
cautious hearts should draw back from his lawless wiles, facilitates
opportunities for accomplishing crimes:  because this is the only fruit
of all his devices that he who is not worshipped with the sacrifice of
cattle and goats, and the burning of incense, should be paid the homage
of divers wicked deeds <span id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xx-p14"></span>IV.  *Timely repentance gains <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xx-p14.1"></span>God’s</span> merciful
consideration.*

<span id="ii.v.xx-p15"></span>Our state of peace <span
id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898.md) , therefore, dearly-beloved, has its
dangers, and it is vain for those who do not withstand vicious desires
to feel secure of the liberty which is the privilege of their Faith. 
Men’s hearts are shown by the character of their works, and the fashion
of their minds is betrayed by the nature of their actions.  For there
are some, as the Apostle says, “who profess that they know <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xx-p16.1"></span>God</span>, but deny Him by
their deeds <span id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899.md) .”  For the charge
of denial is truly incurred when the good which is heard in the sound of
the voice is not present in the conscience.  Indeed, the frailty of
man’s nature easily glides into faults:  and because no sin is without
its attractiveness, deceptive pleasure is quickly acquiesced in.  But we
should run for spiritual succour from the desires of the flesh:  and the
mind that has knowledge of its <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xx-p17.2"></span>God</span> should turn away from the evil
suggestion of the enemy.  Avail thyself of the long-suffering of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xx-p17.3"></span>God</span>, and persist not
in cherishing thy sin, because its punishment is put off.  The sinner
must not feel secure of his impunity, because if he loses <span
id="page_152">p. 152</span> <span id="ii.v.xx-Page_152"></span>the time
for repentance he will find no place for mercy, as the prophet says, “in
death no one remembers thee; and in the realms below who will confess to
thee <span id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900.md) ?”  But let him who
experiences the difficulty of self-amendment and restoration betake
himself to the mercy of a befriending <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xx-p18.2"></span>God</span>, and ask that the chains of evil
habit may be broken off by Him “who lifts up those that fall and raises
all the crushed <span id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901.md) .”  The prayer
of one that confesses will not be in vain since the merciful <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xx-p19.2"></span>God</span> “will grant the
desire of those that fear Him <span id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902.md) ,”
and will give what is asked, as He gave the Source from Which to ask. 
Through our Lend Jesus Christ, Who liveth and reigneth with the Father
and the Holy Ghost for ever and ever.  Amen.
