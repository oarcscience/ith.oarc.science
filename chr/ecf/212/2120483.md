<span id="iii.v.v.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxix-p1.1"></span>Epistle LVI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xxix-p2"></span>To Marinianus, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxix-p3"></span>Gregory to Marinianus, Bishop of
Ravenna.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxix-p4"></span>Moved by the benevolence of the
Apostolical See and the order of ancient custom, we have thought fit to
grant the use of the pallium to thy Fraternity, who art known to have
undertaken the office of government in the Church of Ravenna <span
id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621) .  And remember thou to use it in
no other way but in the proper Church of thy city, when the sons (i.e.
*laity*) have been already dismissed, as thou art proceeding from the
audience chamber <span id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622) to celebrate
the sacred solemnities of mass; but, when mass is finished, thou wilt
take care to lay it by again in the audience chamber.  But outside the
Church, we do not allow thee to use it any more, except four times in
the year, in the litanies which we named to thy predecessor John; giving
thee at the same time this admonition; that, as through the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxix-p6.1"></span>Lord’s</span> bounty thou
hast obtained from us the use of an adornment of this kind to the honour
of the priestly office, so thou strive to adorn also the office
undertaken by thee to the glory of Christ with probity of manners and of
deeds.  For thus wilt thou be conspicuous for two adornments answering
to each other, if with such a vesture of the body as this the good
qualities also of thy soul agree.  For all privileges also which appear
evidently to have been formerly granted to thy Church we confirm by our
authority, and decree that they continue inviolate.
