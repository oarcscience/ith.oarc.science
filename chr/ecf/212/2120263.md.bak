<span id="iii.iv.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.v-p2"></span>How subjects and prelates are to be
admonished.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.v-p3"></span>(*Admonition* 5.)  Differently to be
admonished are subjects and prelates:  the former that subjection crush
them not, the latter that superior place elate them not:  the former
that they fail not to fulfil what is commanded them, the latter that
they command not more to be fulfilled than is just:  the former that
they submit humbly, the latter that they preside temperately.  For this,
which may be understood also figuratively, is said to the former,
*Children, obey your parents in the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.v-p3.1"></span>Lord</span>:*  but to the latter it is
enjoined, *And ye, fathers, provoke not your children to wrath* ([Col.
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.v-p3.2"></span>).  Let the former learn how to order their
inward thoughts before the eyes of the hidden judge; the latter how also
to those that are committed to them to afford outwardly examples of good
living.  For prelates ought to know that, if they ever perpetrate what
is wrong, they are worthy of as many deaths as they transmit examples of
perdition to their subjects.  Wherefore it is necessary that they guard
themselves so much the more cautiously from sin as by the bad things
they do they die not alone, but are guilty of the souls of others, which
by their bad example they have destroyed.  Wherefore the former are to
be admonished, lest they should be strictly published, if merely on
their own account they should be unable to stand acquitted; the latter,
lest they should be judged for the errors of their subjects, even though
on their own account they find themselves secure.  Those are to be
admonished that they live with all the more anxiety about themselves as
they are not entangled by care for others; but these that they
accomplish their charge of others in such wise as not to desist from
charge of themselves, and so to be ardent in anxiety about themselves as
not to grow sluggish in the custody of those committed to them.  To the
one, who is at leisure for his own concerns, it is said, *Go to the ant,
thou sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom* ([Prov. vi.
6](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.v-p3.3"></span>):  but the other is terribly admonished,
when it is said, *My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, thou hast
stricken thy hand with a stranger, and art snared with the words of thy
mouth, and art taken with thine own speeches* ([Prov.
6.1](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.v-p3.4"></span>).  For to be surety for a friend is to
take charge of the soul of another on the surety of one’s own
behaviour.  Whence also the hand is stricken with a stranger, because
the mind is bound with the care of a responsibility which before was
not.  But he is snared with the words of his mouth, and taken with his
own speeches, because, while he is compelled to speak good things to
those who are committed to him, he must needs himself in the first place
observe the things that he speaks.  He is therefore snared with the
words of his mouth, being constrained by the requirement of reason not
to let his life be relaxed to what agrees not with his teaching.  Hence
before the strict judge he is compelled to accomplish <span
id="page_27b">p. 27b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iv.v-Page_27b"></span>as
much in deed as it is plain he has enjoined on others with his voice. 
Thus in the passage above cited this exhortation is also presently
added, *Do therefore what I say, my son, and deliver thyself, seeing
thou hast fallen into the hands of thy neighbour:  run up and down,
hasten, arouse thy friend; give not sleep to thine eyes, nor let thine
eyelids slumber* ([Prov. vi. 3](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.v-p3.5"></span>).  For whosoever is put over others for an
example of life is admonished not only to keep watch himself, but also
to arouse his friend.  For it is not enough for him to keep watch in
living well, if he do not also sever him when he is set over from the
torpor of sin.  For it is well said, *Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor
let thine eyelids slumber* ([Prov.
6.4](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.v-p3.6"></span>).  For indeed to give sleep to the eyes is
to cease from earnestness, so as to neglect altogether the care of our
subordinates.  But the eyelids slumber when our thoughts, weighed down
by sloth, connive at what they know ought to be reproved in
subordinates.  For to be fast asleep is neither to know nor to correct
the deeds of those committed to us.  But to know what things are to be
blamed, and still through laziness of mind not to amend them by meet
rebukes, is not to sleep, but to slumber.  Yet the eye through
slumbering passes into the deepest sleep; since for the most part, when
one who is over others cuts not off the evil that he knows, he comes
sooner or later, as his negligence deserves, not even to know what is
done wrong by his subjects.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.v-p4"></span>Wherefore those who are over others are
to be admonished, that through earnestness of circumspection they have
eyes watchful within and round about, and strive to become living
creatures of heaven ([Ezek. i. 18](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.v-p4.1"></span>).  For the living creatures of heaven are
described as full of eyes round about and within ([Revel. iv.
6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.v-p4.2"></span>).  And so it is meet that those who are
over others should have eyes within and round about, so as both in
themselves to study to please the inward judge, and also, affording
outwardly examples of life, to detect the things that should be
corrected in others.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.v-p5"></span>Subjects are to be admonished that they
judge not rashly the lives of their superiors, if perchance they see
them act blamably in anything, lest whence they rightly find fault with
evil they thence be sunk by the impulse of elation to lower depths. 
They are to be admonished that, when they consider the faults of their
superiors, they grow not too bold against them, but, if any of their
deeds are exceedingly bad, so judge of them within themselves that,
constrained by the fear of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.v-p5.1"></span>God</span>, they still refuse not to bear
the yoke of reverence under them.  Which thing we shall shew the better
if we bring forward what David did ([1 Sam. xxiv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#004.md)<span id="iii.iv.iv.v-p5.2"></span>
*seq.*).  For when Saul the persecutor had entered into a cave to ease
himself, David, who had so long suffered under his persecution, was
within it with his men.  And, when his men incited him to smite Saul, he
cut them short with the reply, that he ought not to put forth his hand
against the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.v-p5.3"></span>Lord’s</span> anointed.  And yet he rose
unperceived, and cut off the border of his robe.  For what is signified
by Saul but bad rulers, and what by David but good subjects?  Saul’s
easing himself, then, means rulers extending the wickedness conceived in
their hearts to works of woful stench, and their shewing the noisome
thoughts within them by carrying them out into deeds.  Yet him David was
afraid to strike, because the pious minds of subjects, withholding
themselves from the whole plague of backbiting, smite the life of their
superiors with no sword of the tongue, even when they blame them for
imperfection.  And when through infirmity they can scarce refrain from
speaking, however humbly, of some extreme and obvious evils in their
superiors, they cut as it were silently the border of their robe;
because, to wit, when, even though harmlessly and secretly, they
derogate from the dignity of superiors, they disfigure as it were the
garment of the king who is set over them; yet still they return to
themselves, and blame themselves most vehemently for even the slightest
defamation in speech.  Hence it is also well written in that place,
*Afterward David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off the border of
Saul’s robe* ([1 Sam. 24.6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.v-p5.4"></span>).  For indeed the deeds of superiors are
not to be smitten with the sword of the mouth, even when they are
rightly judged to be worthy of blame.  But if ever, even in the least,
the tongue slips into censure of them, the heart must needs be depressed
by the affliction of penitence, to the end that it may return to itself,
and, when it has offended against the power set over it, may dread the
judgment against itself of Him by whom it was set over it.  For, when we
offend against those who are set over us, we go against the ordinance of
Him who set them over us.  Whence also Moses, when he had become aware
that the people complained against himself and Aaron, said, *For what
are we?  Not against us are your murmurings, but against the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.v-p5.5"></span>Lord</span>* ([Exod. xvi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#008)<span id="iii.iv.iv.v-p5.6"></span>.md).
