<p class="c30"><a name="iii.iv.iv.ix-p2"></A>How the forward and the faint-hearted are to be admonished.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.iv.iv.ix-p3"></A>(<i>Admonition</i> 9.)&#160; Differently to be admonished are the forward and the faint-hearted.&#160; For the former, presuming on themselves too much, disdain all others when reproved by them; but the latter, while too conscious of their own infirmity, for the most part fall into despondency.&#160; Those count all they do to be singularly eminent; these think what they do to be exceedingly despised, and so are broken down to despondency.&#160; Therefore the works of the forward are to be finely sifted by the reprover, that wherein they please themselves they may be shewn to displease <span class="sc"><a name="iii.iv.iv.ix-p3.1"></A>God</span>.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ix-p4"></A>For we then best correct the forward, when what they believe themselves to have done well we shew to have been ill done; that whence glory is believed to have been gained, thence wholesome confusion may ensue.&#160; But sometimes, when they are not at all aware of being guilty of the vice of forwardness, they more speedily come to correction if they are confounded by the infamy of some other person&#146;s more manifest guilt, sought out from a side quarter; that from that which they cannot defend, they may be made conscious of wrongly holding to what they do defend.&#160; Whence, when Paul saw the Corinthians to be forwardly puffed up one against another, so that one said he was of Paul, another of Apollos, another of Cephas, and another of Christ (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012">1 Cor. 1:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#004">1 Cor. 3:4</a><a name="iii.iv.iv.ix-p4.1"></A>), he brought forward the crime of incest, which had not only been perpetrated among them, but also remained uncorrected, saying, <i>It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one should have his father&#146;s wife.&#160; And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001">1 Cor. 5:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002">2</a><a name="iii.iv.iv.ix-p4.2"></A>).&#160; As if to say plainly, Why say ye in your forwardness that ye are of this one or of the other, while shewing in the dissoluteness of your negligence, that ye are of none of them?</p>  
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ix-p5"></A>But on the other hand we more fitly bring back the faint-hearted to the way of well-doing, if we search collaterally for some good points about them, so that, while some things in them we attack with our reproof, others we may embrace with our praise; to the end that the hearing of praise may nourish their tenderness, which the rebuking of their fault chastises.&#160; And for the most part we make more way with them for their profit, if we also make mention of their good deeds; and, in case of some wrong things having been done by them, if we find not fault with them as though they were already perpetrated, but, as it were, prohibit them as what ought not to be perpetrated; that so both the favour shewn may increase the things which we approve, and our modest exhortation avail more with the faint-hearted against the things which we blame.&#160; Whence the same Paul, when he came to know that the Thessalonians, who stood fast in the preaching which they had received, were troubled with a certain faint-heartedness as though the end of the world were nigh at hand, first praises that wherein he sees them to be strong, and afterwards, with cautious admonition, strengthens what was weak.&#160; For he says, <i>We are bound to thank <span class="sc"><a name="iii.iv.iv.ix-p5.1"></A>God</span> always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; so that we ourselves too glory in you in the churches of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.iv.iv.ix-p5.2"></A>God</span> for your patience and faith</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003">2 Thess. 1:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#004">4</a><a name="iii.iv.iv.ix-p5.3"></A>).&#160; But, having premised these flattering encomiums of their life, a little while after he subjoined, <i>Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.iv.iv.ix-p5.4"></A>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto Him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as sent by us, as that the day of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.iv.iv.ix-p5.5"></A>Lord</span> is at hand</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001">2 Thess. 2.1</a><a name="iii.iv.iv.ix-p5.6"></A>).&#160; For the true teacher so proceeded that they should first hear, in being praised, what they might thankfully acknowledge, and afterwards, in being exhorted, what they should follow; to the end that the precedent praise should settle their mind, lest the subjoined admonition should shake it; and, though he knew that they had been disquieted by suspicion of the end being near, he did not yet reprove them as having been so, but, as if ignorant of the past, forbade them to be disquieted in future; so that, while they believed themselves to be unknown to their preacher with respect even to the levity of their disquietude, they might be as much afraid of being open to blame as they were of being known by him to be so.</p>
