<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>To Theodorus, Physician.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p3"></span>Gregory to Theodorus, Physician to
the Emperor.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4"></span>I myself give thanks to Almighty
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4.1"></span>God</span>, that
distance does not separate the hearts of those who truly love each other
mutually.  For lo, most sweet and glorious son, we are far apart in
body, and yet are present with each other in charity.  This your works,
this your letters testify, this I experienced in you when present, this
I recognize in your Glory when absent.  May this make you both beloved
of men and worthy for ever before Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4.2"></span>God</span>.  For, charity being the
mother of virtues, you bring forth the fruits of good works for this
reason that you keep in your soul the very root of those fruits.  Now
what you have sent me, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4.3"></span>God</span> inspiring you, for the
redemption of captives, I confess that I have received both with joy and
with sorrow.  With joy, that is, for you, whom I thus perceive to be
preparing a mansion in the heavenly country; but with exceeding sorrow
for myself, who, over and above my care of the property of the holy
apostle Peter, must now also give an account of the property of my most
sweet son, the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4.4"></span>Lord</span> Theodorus, and be held
responsible for having spent it carefully or negligently.  But may
Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4.5"></span>God</span>, who has poured into your
mind the bowels of His own mercy, who has granted to you to take anxious
thought for what is said of our Saviour by the excellent preacher—*That,
though he was rich, yet for us he became poor* ([2 Cor. viii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4.6"></span>)—may He, at the coming of the same
Saviour, shew you to be rich in virtues, cause you to stand free from
all fault, and grant to you heavenly for earthly joys, abiding joys for
transitory.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p5"></span>As to what you say you desire to be
done for you near the most sacred body of the holy apostle Peter, be
assured that, though your tongue were silent, your charity bids the
doing of it.  Would indeed that we were worthy to pray for you:  but
that I am not worthy I have no doubt.  Still, however, there are here
many worthy folk, who are being redeemed from the enemy by your
offering, and serve our Creator faithfully, with regard to whom you have
done what is written; *Lay up alms in the bosom of the poor, and it
shall pray for thee* ([Ecclesiasticus
29.15](../../../bib/apo/sir029.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p5.1"></span>).

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p6"></span>But, since he loves the more who
presumes the more, I have some complaint against the most sweet
disposition of my most glorious son the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p6.1"></span>Lord</span> Theodorus; namely that he
has received from the holy Trinity the gift of genius, the gift of
wealth, the gift of mercy and charity, and yet is unceasingly bound up
in secular causes, is occupied in continual processions, and neglects to
read daily the words of his Redeemer.  For what is sacred Scripture but
a kind of epistle of Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p6.2"></span>God</span> to His creature?  And surely,
if your Glory were resident in any other place, and were to receive
letters from an earthly emperor, you would not loiter, you would not
rest, you would not give sleep to your eyes, till you had learnt what
the earthly emperor had written.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p7"></span>The Emperor of Heaven, the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p7.1"></span>Lord</span> of men and
angels, has sent thee his epistles for thy life’s behoof; and yet,
glorious son, thou neglectest to read these epistles ardently.  Study
then, I beseech thee, and daily meditate on the words of thy Creator. 
Learn the heart of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p7.2"></span>God</span> in the words of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p7.3"></span>God</span>, that thou
mayest sigh more ardently for the things that are eternal, that your
soul may be kindled with greater longings for heavenly joys.  For a man
will have the greater rest here in proportion as he has now no rest in
the love of his Maker.  But, that you may act thus, may Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p7.4"></span>God</span> pour into
you the Spirit the Comforter:  may He fill your soul with His presence,
and in filling it, compose it.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p8"></span>As to me, know ye that I suffer here
many and innumerable bitternesses.  But I give thanks to Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p8.1"></span>God</span> that I
suffer far less than I deserve.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p9"></span>I commend to your Glory my son, your
patient, the lord Narses.  I know indeed that you hold him as in all
respects commended to you; but I beg you to do what you are doing, that,
in asking for what I see is being done, I may by my asking have a share
in your reward.  Furthermore, I have received the blessing <span
id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553.md) of your Excellency with the charity
wherewith it was sent to me.  And I have presumed to send you, in
acknowledgment of your love, a duck with two small ducklings, that, as
often as your eye is led to look at it, the memory also of me may be
<span id="page_157b">p. 157b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iv.xxiii-Page_157b"></span>recalled to you among the
occupations and tumults of business.
