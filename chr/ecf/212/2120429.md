id="iii.v.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Epistle VIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.viii-p2"></span>To Januarius, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iv.viii-p3"></span>Gregory to Januarius, Bishop of
Caralis (*Cagliari*).

<span id="iii.v.iv.viii-p4"></span>We think indeed that thy position may
in itself be enough to compel thee to be instant in the fulfilment of
pious duties.  But, lest remissness of any kind should intervene to
abate thy zeal, we have thought it right to exhort thee especially with
regard to them.  Now it has come to our knowledge that your Stephen,
when departing this life, by his last will and testament directed a
monastery to be founded.  But it is said that his desire is so far
unaccomplished owing to the delay of the honourable lady Theodosia, his
heiress.  Wherefore we exhort thy Fraternity to pay the utmost attention
to this matter, and admonish the above-named lady, to the end that
within a year’s space she may establish a monastery as has been
directed, and construct everything without dispute according to the will
of the departed.  But if she should put off the completion of the design
out of negligence or artfulness (as, for instance, if she is unable to
found it in the place that had been appointed, and it is thought fit
that it be placed elsewhere, and the matter is neglected through the
intervening delay), then we desire that it be built by the diligence of
thy Fraternity, and that, all things being set in order, the effects and
revenues that have been left be appropriated by thee to this venerable
place.  For so thou wilt both escape condemnation for remissness before
the awful Judge, and, in accordance with our most religious laws, wilt
be accomplishing with episcopal zeal the pious wishes of the departed,
which had been disregarded <span id="fr_1529"></span>[1530](#fn_1529) .
