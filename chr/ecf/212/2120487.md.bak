<span id="iii.v.vi.i-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vi.i-p2.1"></span>Epistle I.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.i-p3"></span>To Marinianus, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.vi.i-p4"></span>Gregory to Marinianus, Bishop of
Ravenna.

<span id="iii.v.vi.i-p5"></span>As unjust demands should not be
conceded, so the petition of such as desire what is lawful ought not to
be set aside.  Now your Fraternity’s presbyters, deacons and clergy have
presented to us a petition complaining that the late John, your
predecessor, made a will burdening his Church with various bequests. 
And they have petitioned that these, which are to the detriment of his
Church, should under no excuse be paid, as being prohibited by law.  And
although, heredity and succession having been by him renounced, no
reason binds thee to satisfy any such claims, nevertheless we hereby
exhort thee over and above that with regard to such bequests as he has
made, contrary to the ordinances of the laws, of property belonging to
his Church, or acquired by him in his episcopate, your Fraternity
neither lend your authority nor on any account consent to them.  But, if
he has wished or directed anything to be done with regard to his private
property which he had before his episcopate, and which he had not
previously bestowed upon his Church, it is necessary that this
disposition should be held valid in all respects, and that no one of the
ecclesiastics should attempt against reason on any pretext to set it
aside.

<span id="iii.v.vi.i-p6"></span>But, inasmuch as during his life he
often begged of us that we should confirm by our authority what he had
conferred on the monastery which he had himself constructed near the
church of Saint Apollinaris, and we promised to do this, we hold it
needful to exhort your Fraternity to suffer nothing of what he has there
conferred and constituted to be diminished, but to see to all being
preserved and firmly established.  Since, then, he is known to have made
mention of this monastery, and of the property conferred on it, in the
will which he made, you must know that we have not confirmed this part
of it by reason of our following his last wishes, but because, as we
have said, we promised it to him when he was alive.  Let your
Fraternity, therefore, make haste so carefully to accomplish all these
things that both what was by him constituted and by us confirmed in the
above-named monastery may be maintained, and what he has by will
directed to be given or done to the detriment of his Church may have no
validity, seeing that the law forbids it.
