<span id="ii.iv.xcix"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xcix-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xcix-p1.1"></span>Letter CIV.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xcix-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xcix-p2.1"></span>Leo, the Bishop, to Marcian Augustus.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xcix-p3"></span>(To Marcian Augustus, about the
presumption of Anatolius, by the hand of Lucian the bishop and Basil the
deacon.)

<span id="ii.iv.xcix-p4"></span>I.  *He congratulates the Emperor on his
share in the triumph of the catholic Faith.*

<span id="ii.iv.xcix-p5"></span>By the great bounty of God’s mercy the
joys of the whole catholic Church were multiplied when through your
clemency’s holy and glorious zeal the most pestilential error was
abolished among us; so that our labours the more speedily reached their
desired end, because your God-serving Majesty had so faithfully and
powerfully assisted them.  For although the liberty of the Gospel had to
be defended against certain dissentients in the power of the Holy Ghost,
and through the instrumentality of the Apostolic See, yet <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xcix-p5.1"></span>God’s</span> grace has
shown itself more manifestly (than we could have hoped) by vouchsafing
to the world that in the victory of the Truth only the authors of the
violation of the Faith should perish <span
id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) and the Church restored to her
soundness.  Accordingly the war which the enemy of our peace had stirred
up, was so happily ended, the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xcix-p6.1"></span>Lord’s</span> right hand fighting for us,
that when Christ triumphed all His priests shared in the one victory,
and when the light of Truth shone forth, only the shades of error, with
its champions, were dispelled.  For as in believing the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xcix-p6.2"></span>Lord’s</span> own
resurrection, with a view to strengthen the beginnings of Faith,
confidence was much increased by the fact that certain Apostles doubted
of the bodily reality of our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xcix-p6.3"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, and by examining
the prints of the nails and the wound of the <span id="page_75">p.
75</span> <span id="ii.iv.xcix-Page_75"></span>spear with sight and
touch removed the doubts of all by doubting; so now, too, while the
misbelief of some is refuted, the hearts of all hesitaters are
strengthened, and that which caused blindness to some few avails for the
enlightenment of the whole body.  In which work your clemency duly and
rightly rejoices, having faithfully and properly provided that the
devil’s snares should do no hurt to the Eastern churches, but that to
propitiate <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xcix-p6.4"></span>God</span>
everywhere more acceptable holocausts should be offered; seeing that
through the mediator between <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xcix-p6.5"></span>God</span> and man, the Man Christ Jesus,
one and the self-same creed is held by people, priests, and princes, O
most glorious son and most clement Augustus.

<span id="ii.iv.xcix-p7"></span>II.  *Considering all the circumstances
Anatolius might have been expected to show more modesty.*

<span id="ii.iv.xcix-p8"></span>But now that these things, about which
so great a concourse of priests assembled, have been brought to a good
and desirable conclusion, I am surprised and grieved that the peace of
the universal Church which had been divinely restored is again being
disturbed by a spirit of self-seeking.  For although my brother
Anatolius seems necessarily to have consulted his own interest in
forsaking the error of those who ordained him, and with salutary change
of mind accepting the catholic Faith, yet he ought to have taken care
not to mar by any depravity of desire that which he is known to have
obtained through your means <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) . 
For we, having regard to your faith and intervention, though his
antecedents were suspicious on account of those who consecrated
him <span id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md) , wished to be kind rather
than just towards him, that by the use of healing measures we might
assuage all disturbances which through the operations of the devil had
been excited; and this ought to have made him modest rather than the
opposite.  For even if he had been lawfully and regularly ordained for
conspicuous merit, and by the wisest selection yet without respect to
the canons of the Fathers, the ordinances of the Holy Ghost, and the
precedents of antiquity, no votes could have availed in his favour.  I
speak before a Christian and a truly religious, truly orthodox prince
(when I say that) Anatolius the bishop detracts greatly from his proper
merits in desiring undue aggrandizement.

<span id="ii.iv.xcix-p11"></span>III.  *The city of Constantinople,
royal though it be, can never be raised to Apostolic rank.*

<span id="ii.iv.xcix-p12"></span>Let the city of Constantinople have, as
we desire, its high rank, and under the protection of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xcix-p12.1"></span>God’s</span> right hand,
long enjoy your clemency’s rule.  Yet things secular stand on a
different basis from things divine:  and there can be no sure building
save on that rock which the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xcix-p12.2"></span>Lord</span> has laid for a foundation.  He
that covets what is not his due, loses what is his own.  Let it be
enough for Anatolius that by the aid of your piety and by my favour and
approval he has obtained the bishopric of so great a city.  Let him not
disdain a city which is royal, though he cannot make it an Apostolic
See <span id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md) ; and let him on no account
hope that he can rise by doing injury to others.  For the privileges of
the churches determined by the canons of the holy Fathers, and fixed by
the decrees of the Nicene Synod, cannot be overthrown by any
unscrupulous act, nor disturbed by any innovation.  And in the faithful
execution of this task by the aid of Christ I am bound to display an
unflinching devotion; for it is a charge entrusted to me, and it tends
to my condemnation if the rules sanctioned by the Fathers and drawn up
under the guidance of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xcix-p13.1"></span>God’s</span> Spirit at the Synod of Nicæa
for the government of the whole Church are violated with my connivance
(which <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xcix-p13.2"></span>God</span>
forbid), and if the wishes of a single brother have more weight with me
than the common good of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xcix-p13.3"></span>Lord’s</span> whole house.

<span id="ii.iv.xcix-p14"></span>IV.  *He asks the Emperor to express
his disapproval of Anatolius’ self-seeking spirit.*

<span id="ii.iv.xcix-p15"></span>And therefore knowing that your
glorious clemency is anxious for the peace of the Church and extends its
protection and approval to those measures which conduce to pacific
unity, I pray and beseech you with earnest entreaty to refuse all
sanction and protection to these unscrupulous attempts against Christian
unity and peace, and put a salutary check upon my brother Anatolius’
desires, which will only injure himself, if he persists:  that he may
not desire things which are opposed to your glory and the needs of the
times, and wish to be greater than his predecessors, and that it may be
free for him to be as pre-eminent as he can in virtues, in which he will
be partaker only if he prefer to be adorned with love rather than puffed
up with ambition.  The conception of this unwarrantable wish he ought
indeed never to have received within the secret of his heart, but when
my brothers and fellow-bishops who were there to represent me withstood
him, he might at least have desisted from his unlawful <span
id="page_76">p. 76</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xcix-Page_76"></span>self-seeking at their wholesome
opposition.  For both your gracious Majesty and his own letter affirm
that the legates of the Apostolic See opposed him as they ought with the
most justifiable resistance, so that his presumption was the less
excusable in that not even when rebuked did it restrain itself.

<span id="ii.iv.xcix-p16"></span>V.  *And to try to bring him to a right
mind.*

<span id="ii.iv.xcix-p17"></span>And hence, because it becomes your
glorious faith that, as heresy was overthrown, <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xcix-p17.1"></span>God</span> acting through you, so now all
self-seeking should be defeated, do that which beseems both your
Christian and your kingly goodness, so that the said bishop may obey the
Fathers, further the cause of peace, and not think he had any right to
ordain a bishop <span id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md) for the Church
of Antioch, as he presumed to do without any precedent and contrary to
the provisions of the canons:  an act which from a longing to
re-establish the Faith and in the interests of peace we have determined
not to cancel.  Let him abstain therefore from doing despite to the
rules of the Church and shun unlawful excesses, lest in attempting
things unfavourable to peace he cut himself off from the universal
Church.  I had much liefer love him for acting blamelessly than find him
persist in this presumptuous frame of mind which may separate him from
us all.  My brother and fellow-bishop, Lucian, who with my son, Basil
the deacon, brought your clemency’s letter to me, has fulfilled the
duties he undertook as legate with all devotion:  for he must not be
reckoned to have failed in his mission, the course of events having
rather failed him.  Dated the 22nd of May in the consulship of the
illustrious Herculanus (452).
