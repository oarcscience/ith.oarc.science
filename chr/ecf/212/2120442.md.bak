id="iii.v.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXIX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxi-p2"></span>To Januarius, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxi-p3"></span>Gregory to Januarius, Bishop of
Caralis (*Cagliari*).

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxi-p4"></span>It has come to our knowledge that in
the place within the province of Sardinia called Phausiana it is said to
have been once the custom to ordain a bishop; but that, through stress
of circumstances, the custom has for long fallen into disuse.  But, as
we are aware that now, owing to scarcity of priests, certain pagans
remain there, living like wild beasts, and entirely ignorant of the
worship of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxi-p4.1"></span>God</span>, we exhort thy Fraternity to
make haste to ordain a bishop there according to the ancient way; such a
one, that is, as may be suitable for this work, and may take pains to
bring wanderers into the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxi-p4.2"></span>Lord’s</span> flock with pastoral zeal;
that so, while he devotes himself there to the saving of souls, neither
may you be found to have required what was superfluous, nor may we
repent of having re-established in vain what had been once discontinued.
