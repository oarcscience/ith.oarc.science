<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.i.xix-p2"></A>To Anastasius, Patriarch of Antioch.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.i.xix-p3"></A>[The beginning of this epistle is the same as that of Epistle VII. to the same Anastasius as far as the words &#8220;stand on the shore of virtue&#8221;; after which it is continued as follows.]</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.i.xix-p4"></A>But, as to your calling me the mouth and lantern of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xix-p4.1"></A>Lord</span>, and alleging that I profit many by speaking, and am able to give light to many, I confess that you have brought me into a state of the greatest doubt in my estimate of myself.&#160; For I consider what I am, and detect in myself no sign of all this good.&#160; But I consider also what you are, and I do not think that you can lie.&#160; When, then, I would believe what you say, my infirmity contradicts me.&#160; When I would dispute what is said in my praise, your sanctity contradicts me.&#160; But I pray you, holy man, let us come to some agreement in this our contest, that, though it is not as you say, it may be so because you say it.&#160; Moreover, I have addressed my synodical epistle to you, as to the other patriarchs, your brethren&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1323"></A><A HREF="#fn_1323"><FONT SIZE="1">1324</FONT></A>
; inasmuch as with me you are always what it has been granted you to be by the gift of Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xix-p5.1"></A>God</span>, without regard to what you are accounted not to be by the will of men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1324"></A><A HREF="#fn_1324"><FONT SIZE="1">1325</FONT></A>
.&#160; I have given some instructions to Boniface the guardian (<i>defensori</i>), who is the bearer of these presents, for him to communicate to your holiness in private.&#160; Moreover, I have sent you keys of the blessed apostle Peter, who loves you, which are wont to shine forth with many miracles when placed on the bodies of sick persons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1325"></A><A HREF="#fn_1325"><FONT SIZE="1">1326</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.i.xix-p5"></A> The Benedictine Editors adopt the reading <i>patribus</i> instead of <i>fratribus</i>.&#160; But the sense seems to require the latter.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.i.xix-p7"></A> Keys of St. Peter&#146;s sepulchre, in which had been inserted filings from his alleged chains preserved at Rome, were often sent by Gregory to distinguished friends (cf. III. 48; VI. 6; VII. 26; VIII. 35; IX. 122; XI. 66), to be hung round the neck (VI. 6) or deposited (XI. 66), or used for healing.&#160; For an account of how the filings were obtained, see IV. 30.&#160; In one instance the key is described as being of gold (VII. 26).&#160; To Eulogius of Alexandria is sent a small cross containing filings from the chains, to be applied to his sore eyes.</p>
