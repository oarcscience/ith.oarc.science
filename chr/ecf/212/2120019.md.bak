<span id="ii.iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Letter IX.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>To Dioscorus, Bishop of Alexandria.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p3"></span>Leo, the bishop, to Dioscorus, bishop of
Alexandria, greeting.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p4"></span>I.  *The churches of Rome and Alexandria
should be at one in everything.*

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p5"></span>How much of the divine love we feel for
you, beloved, you will be able to estimate from this, that we are
anxious to establish your beginnings on a surer basis, lest anything
should seem lacking to the perfection of your love, since your
meritorious acts of spiritual grace, as we have proved, are already in
your favour.  Fatherly and brotherly conference, therefore, ought to be
most grateful to you, holy brother, and received by you in the same
spirit as you know it is offered by us.  For you and we ought to be at
one in thought and act, so that as we read <span
id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) , in us also there may be proved to be
one heart and one mind.  For since the most blessed Peter received the
headship of the Apostles from the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ix-p6.2"></span>Lord</span>, and the church of Rome still
abides by His institutions, it is wicked to believe that His holy
disciple Mark, who was the first to govern the church of
Alexandria <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) , formed his decrees on
a different line of tradition:  seeing that without doubt both disciple
and master drew but one Spirit from the same fount of grace, and the
ordained could not hand on aught else than what he had received from his
ordainer.  We do not therefore allow it that we should differ in
anything, since we confess ourselves to be of one body and faith, nor
that the institutions of the teacher should seem different to those of
the taught.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p8"></span>II.  *Fixed days should be observed for
ordaining priests and deacons.*

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p9"></span>That therefore which we know to have been
very carefully observed by our fathers, we wish kept by you also, viz.
that the ordination of priests or deacons should not be performed at
random on any day:  but after Saturday, the commencement of that night
which precedes the dawn of the first day of the week should be chosen on
which the sacred benediction should be bestowed on those who are to be
consecrated, ordainer and ordained alike fasting.  This observance will
not be violated, if actually on the morning of the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.ix-p9.1"></span>Lord’s</span> day it be
celebrated without breaking the Saturday fast:  for the beginning of the
preceding night forms part of that period, and undoubtedly belongs to
the day of resurrection as is clearly laid down with regard to the feast
of Easter <span id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) .  For besides the weight
of custom which we know rests upon the Apostles’ teaching, Holy Writ
also makes this clear, because when the Apostles sent Paul and Barnabas
at the bidding of the Holy Ghost to preach the gospel to the nations,
they laid hands on them fasting and praying:  that we may know with what
devoutness both giver and receiver must be on their guard lest so
blessed a sacrament should seem to be carelessly performed.  And
therefore you will piously and laudably follow Apostolic precedents if
you yourself also maintain this form of ordaining priests throughout the
churches over which the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ix-p10.1"></span>Lord</span> has called you to preside:  viz.
that those who are to be consecrated should never receive the blessing
except on the day of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ix-p10.2"></span>Lord’s</span> resurrection, which is commonly
held to begin on the evening of Saturday, and which has been so often
hallowed in the mysterious dispensations of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ix-p10.3"></span>God</span> that all the more notable
institutions of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ix-p10.4"></span>Lord</span> were accomplished on that high
day.  On it the world took its beginning.  On it through the
resurrection of Christ death received its destruction, and life its
commencement.  On it the apostles take from the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ix-p10.5"></span>Lord’s</span> hands the trumpet of the gospel
<span id="page_8">p. 8</span> <span id="ii.iv.ix-Page_8"></span>which is
to be preached to all nations, and receive the sacrament of
regeneration <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) which they are to bear
to the whole world.  On it, as blessed John the Evangelist bears witness
when all the disciples were gathered together in one place, and when,
the doors being shut, the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ix-p11.7"></span>Lord</span> entered to them, He breathed on
them and said:  “Receive the Holy Ghost:  whose sins ye have remitted
they are remitted to them:  and whose ye have retained, they shall be
retained <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) .”  On it lastly the Holy
Spirit that had been promised to the Apostles by the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.ix-p12.2"></span>Lord</span> came:  and so we
know it to have been suggested and handed down by a kind of heavenly
rule, that on that day we ought to celebrate the mysteries of the
blessing of priests on which all these gracious gifts were conferred.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p13"></span>III.  *The repetition of the Holy
Eucharist on the great festivals is not undesirable.*

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p14"></span>Again, that our usage may coincide at all
points, we wish this thing also to be observed, viz. that when any of
the greater festivals has brought together a larger congregation than
usual, and too great a crowd of the faithful has assembled for one
church <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) to hold them all at once,
there should be no hesitation about repeating the oblation of the
sacrifice:  lest, if those only are admitted to this service who come
first, those who flock in afterwards, should seem to be rejected:  for
it is fully in accordance with piety and reason, that as often as a
fresh congregation has filled the church where service is going on, the
sacrifice should be offered as a matter of course.  Whereas a certain
portion of the people must be deprived of their worship, if the custom
of only one celebration <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) be kept,
and only those who come early in the day can offer the sacrifice <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) .  We admonish you, therefore, beloved,
earnestly and affectionately that your carefulness also should not
neglect what has become a part of our own usage on the pattern of our
fathers’ tradition, so that in all things we may agree together in our
beliefs and in our performances.  Consequently, we have given this
letter to our son Possidonius, a presbyter, on his return, that he may
bear it to you, brother; he has so often taken part in our ceremonials
and ordinations, and has been sent to us so many times that he knows
quite well what Apostolic authority we possess in all things.  Dated 21
June (? 445).

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p10"></span> That is to say, the weekly resurrection
festival (Sunday) begins with the vespers of the preceding evening: 
this is notably the case in the yearly festival of Easter, at least in
Western use.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[8:59](2120019.htm#fr_58.md) <span
id="ii.iv.ix-p10.6"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p11"></span> *Sacramentum regenerationis*:  the
reference in the first part of the sentence seems to be S. [Mark xvi.
15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015.md)<span id="ii.iv.ix-p11.1"></span>,
and here in the latter part to S. [Matt. xxviii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md)<span id="ii.iv.ix-p11.2"></span>,
and both these records seem to refer to the same manifestation.  S.
Matthew says it was to “the eleven disciples” in Galilee, in “the
mountain where Jesus had appointed them,” that He gave the command, if
indeed [Matt. 28.16-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.iv.ix-p11.3"></span> of the xxviiith chapter form one continuous
narrative.  The author of S. [Mark xvi.
9-20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009.md)<span id="ii.iv.ix-p11.4"></span>
says it was to the eleven “as they sat at meat.”  Is it possible that
Leo took <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.ix-p11.5"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.ix-p11.6"></span>νακειμένοις</span> to mean as they were
partaking of the Holy Eucharist? if not, what countenance is there for
his assertion of its being on the first day of the week?

<span id="fn_59"></span>[8:60](2120019.htm#fr_59.md) <span

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p17"></span> It can hardly escape notice that the
people here are distinctly said “to offer the sacrifice” in the person
of their representative and mouthpiece, the priest.  And this is the
language and intention of all Liturgies (ancient and modern) of the
Church.
