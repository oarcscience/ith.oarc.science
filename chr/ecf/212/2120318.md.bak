id="iii.v.i.xvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xvi-p2"></span>To Honoratus, Deacon of Salona.

<span id="iii.v.i.xvi-p3"></span>Gregory to Honoratus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xvi-p4"></span>Having read the contradictory letters
which thou and thy bishop have addressed to us against each other, we
grieve that there is so little charity between you.  Nevertheless we
enjoin thee to continue in the administration of thy office, and, if the
cause of offence between you can, under the power of grace, be settled
on the spot, we believe it will be <span id="page_80b">p. 80b</span>
<span id="iii.v.i.xvi-Page_80b"></span>greatly to the advantage of your
souls.  But in case the discord between you has so set you in arms
against each other that you have no will to allay the swelling of your
offence, do thou without delay come to be heard before us, and let thy
bishop send to us on his own behalf such person as he may choose,
furnished with instructions; that, after minutely considering the whole
case, we may settle what may appear fit between the parties.  But we
would have thee know that we shall make strict enquiry of thee on all
points, as to whether the ornaments <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319.md) , either those of thine own church,
or such as have been collected from various churches, are being now kept
with all care and fidelity.  For, if any of them shall be found to have
been lost through negligence or through any person’s dishonesty, thou
wilt be involved in the guilt of this, being, in virtue of thy office of
Archdeacon, peculiarly responsible for the custody of the said church.
