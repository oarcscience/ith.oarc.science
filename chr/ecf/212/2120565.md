id="iii.v.viii.iv-p1.1"></span>Epistle V.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.iv-p2"></span>*To various Metropolitans and
Bishops* <span id="fr_1732"></span>[1733](#fn_1732.md) .

<span id="iii.v.viii.iv-p4"></span>Gregory to Eusebius of Thessalonica,
Urbitius of Dyracchium, Constantius ofMediolanum *(Milan*), Andrew of
Nicopolis, John of Corinth, John of Prima Justiniana, John *Cretensi
Scoritano*, John of Larissa, Marinianus of Ravenna, Januarius of Caralis
(*Cagliari*) in Sardinia, and all the bishops of Sicily.

<span id="iii.v.viii.iv-p5"></span>I have taken care to transmit to your
Fraternity the law which the most pious Emperor has issued, to the
effect that such as are bound by engagements of military service or
public liabilities, may not in any case, in order to escape risk of
being called to account, assume the condition of ecclesiastics, or
become monks:  and this I especially press upon you, that such as are
involved in secular engagements are not to be received hastily among the
clergy of the Church, since, while they live in an ecclesiastical
condition no otherwise than they had lived before, they are by no means
trying to escape secular affairs, but to change them.  But, if any such
should even seek a monastery, they are by no means to be received unless
they have first been absolved from their public liabilities.  Further,
if any from the military order are in haste to become monks, they are
not to be received rashly, or until their life has been fully enquired
into.  And, according to the regular rule, they ought to undergo a
probation of three years, and then, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.iv-p5.1"></span>God</span> granting it, assume the
monastic habit.  And if they have thus been proved and accepted, and are
anxious, for the good of their souls, to do penance for the sins they
have committed, then, with a view to their heavenly life and gain,
monastic profession should not be denied them.  With respect to this
matter also, believe me, the most serene and most Christian Emperor is
in every way pacified, and willingly allows the monastic profession of
those whom he knows not to be implicated in public liabilities.  The
Month of December, first Indiction.
