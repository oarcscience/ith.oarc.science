<span id="ii.v.xxiii"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Sermon XLII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p2.1"></span>On Lent, IV.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p3"></span>I.  *The Lenten fast an opportunity for
restoring our purity.*

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p4"></span>In proposing to preach this most holy
and important fast to you, dearly beloved, how shall I begin more fitly
than by quoting the words of the Apostle, in whom Christ Himself was
speaking, and by reminding you of what we have read <span
id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920.md) :  “behold, now is the acceptable
time, behold now is the day of salvation.”  For though there are no
seasons which are not full of Divine blessings, and though access is
ever open to us to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p5.1"></span>God’s</span> mercy through His grace, yet
now all men’s minds should be moved with greater zeal to spiritual
progress, and animated by larger confidence, when the return of the day,
on which we were redeemed, invites us to all the duties of godliness: 
that we may keep the super-excellent mystery of the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxiii-p5.2"></span>Lord’s</span> passion with
bodies and hearts purified.  These great mysteries do indeed require
from us such unflagging devotion and unwearied reverence that we should
remain in <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p5.3"></span>God’s</span> sight always the same, as we
ought to be found on the Easter feast itself.  But because few have this
constancy, and, because so long as the stricter observance is relaxed in
consideration of the frailty of the flesh, and so long as one’s
interests extend over all the various actions of this life, even pious
hearts must get some soils from the dust of the world, the Divine
Providence has with great beneficence taken care that the discipline of
the forty days should heal us and restore the purity of our minds,
during which the faults of other times might be redeemed by pious acts
and removed by chaste fasting.

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p6"></span>II.  *Lent must be used for removing all
our defilements, and of good works there must be no stint.*

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p7"></span>As we are therefore, dearly-beloved,
about to enter on those mystic days which are dedicated to the benefits
of fasting, let us take care to obey the Apostle’s precepts, cleansing
“ourselves from every defilement of flesh and spirit <span
id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md) :”  that by controlling the struggles
that go on between our two natures, the spirit which, if it is under the
guidance of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p8.2"></span>God</span>, should be the governor of the
body, may uphold the dignity of its rule:  so that we may give no
offence to any, nor be subject to the chidings of reprovers.  For we
shall be rightly attacked with rebukes, and through our fault ungodly
tongues will arm themselves to do harm to religion, if the conduct of
those that fast is at variance with the standard of perfect purity.  For
our fast does not consist chiefly of mere abstinence from food, nor are
dainties withdrawn from our bodily appetites with profit, unless the
mind is recalled from wrong-doing and the tongue restrained from
slandering.  This is a time of gentleness and long-suffering, of peace
and tranquillity:  when all the pollutions of vice are to be eradicated
and continuance of virtue is to be attained by us.  Now let godly minds
boldly accustom themselves to forgive faults, to pass over insults, and
to forget wrongs.  Now let the faithful spirit train himself with the
armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, that through
honour and dishonour, through ill repute and good repute, the conscience
may be undisturbed in unwavering uprightness, not puffed up by praise
and not wearied out by revilings.  The self-restraint of the religious
should not be gloomy, but sincere; no murmurs of complaint should be
heard from those who are never without the consolation of holy joys. 
The decrease of worldly means should not be feared in the practice of
works of mercy.  Christian poverty is always rich, because what it has
is more than what it has not.  Nor does the poor man fear to labour in
this world, to whom it is given to possess all things in the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxiii-p8.3"></span>Lord</span> of all things. 
Therefore those who do the things which are good must have no manner of
fear lest the power of doing should fail them; since in the gospel the
widow’s devotion is extolled in the case of her two mites, and voluntary
bounty gets its reward for a cup of cold water <span
id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md) .  For the measure of our
charitableness is fixed by the sincerity of our feelings, and he that
shows mercy on others will never want for mercy himself.  The holy widow
of Sarepta discovered this, who offered the blessed Elias in the time of
famine one day’s food, which was all she had, and putting the prophet’s
hunger before her own needs, ungrudgingly gave up a handful of corn and
a little oil <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md) .  But she did not
lose <span id="page_157">p. 157</span> <span
id="ii.v.xxiii-Page_157"></span>what she gave in all faith, and in the
vessels emptied by her godly bounty a source of new plenty arose, that
the fulness of her substance might not be diminished by the holy purpose
to which she had put it, because she had never dreaded being brought to
want.

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p11"></span>III.  *As with the Saviour, so with us,
the devil tries to make our very piety its own snare.*

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p12"></span>But, dearly-beloved, doubt not that the
devil, who is the opponent of all virtues, is jealous of these good
desires, to which we are confident you are prompted of your own selves,
and that to this end he is arming the force of his malice in order to
make your very piety its own snare, and endeavouring to overcome by
boastfulness those whom he could not defeat by distrustfulness.  For the
vice of pride is a near neighbour to good deeds, and arrogance ever lies
in wait hard by virtue:  because it is hard for him that lives
praise-worthily not to be caught by man’s praise unless, as it is
written, “he that glorieth, glorieth in the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p12.1"></span>Lord <span
id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md) </span>.”  Whose intentions would that
most naughty enemy not dare to attack? whose fasting would he not seek
to break down? seeing that, as has been shown in the reading of the
Gospel <span id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925.md) , he did not restrain his
wiles even against the Saviour of the world Himself.  For being
exceedingly afraid of His fast, which lasted 40 days and nights, he
wished most cunningly to discover whether this power of abstinence was
given Him or His very own:  for he need not fear the defeat of all his
treacherous designs, if Christ were throughout subject to the same
conditions as He is in body <span id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926.md) . 
And so he first craftily examined whether He were Himself the Creator of
all things, such that He could change the natures of material things as
He pleased:  secondly, whether under the form of human flesh the Godhead
lay concealed, to Whom it was easy to make the air His chariot, and
convey His earthly limbs through space.  But when the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxiii-p15.1"></span>Lord</span> preferred to
resist him by the uprightness of His true Manhood, than to display the
power of His Godhead, to this he turns the craftiness of his third
design, that he might tempt by the lust of empire Him in Whom the signs
of Divine power had failed, and entice Him to the worship of himself by
promising the kingdoms of the world.  But the devil’s cleverness was
rendered foolish by <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p15.2"></span>God’s</span> wisdom, so that the proud foe
was bound by that which he had formerly bound, and did not fear to
assail Him Whom it behoved to be slain for the world.

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p16"></span>IV.  *The perverse turn even their
fasting into sin.*

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p17"></span>This adversary’s wiles then let us
beware of, not only in the enticements of the palate, but also in our
purpose of abstinence.  For he who knew how to bring death upon mankind
by means of food, knows also how to harm us through our very fasting,
and using the Manichæans as his tools, as he once drove men to take what
was forbidden, so in the opposite direction he prompts them to avoid
what is allowed.  It is indeed a helpful observance, which accustoms one
to scanty diet, and checks the appetite for dainties:  but woe to the
dogmatizing of those whose very fasting is turned to sin.  For they
condemn the creature’s nature to the Creator’s injury, and maintain that
they are defiled by eating those things of which they contend the devil,
not <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxiii-p17.1"></span>God</span>, is
the author:  although absolutely nothing that exists is evil, nor is
anything in nature included in the actually bad.  For the good Creator
made all things good and the Maker of the universe is one, “Who made the
heaven and the earth, the sea and all that is in them <span
id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927.md) .”  Of which whatever is granted to
man for food and drink, is holy and clean after its kind.  But if it is
taken with immoderate greed, it is the excess that disgraces the eaters
and drinkers, not the nature of the food or drink that defiles them. 
“For all things,” as the Apostle says, “are clean to the clean.  But to
the defiled and unbelieving nothing is clean, but their mind and
conscience is defiled <span id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928.md) .”

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p20"></span>V.  *Be reasonable and seasonable in
your fasting.*

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p21"></span>But ye, dearly-beloved, the holy
offspring of the catholic Mother, who have been taught in the school of
Truth by <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p21.1"></span>God’s</span> Spirit, moderate your liberty
with due reasonableness, knowing that it is good to abstain even from
things lawful, and at seasons of greater strictness to distinguish one
food from another with a view to giving up the use of some kinds, not to
condemning their nature.  And so be not infected with the error of those
who are corrupted merely by their own ordinances, “serving the creature
rather than the Creator <span id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929.md) ,” and
offering a foolish abstinence to the service of the lights of heaven: 
seeing that they have chosen to fast on the first and second days of the
week in honour of the sun and moon, proving themselves in this one
instance of their perverseness twice disloyal to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p22.2"></span>God</span>, twice blasphemous, by setting
up their <span id="page_158">p. 158</span> <span
id="ii.v.xxiii-Page_158"></span>fast not only in worship of the stars
but also in contempt of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p22.3"></span>Lord’s</span> Resurrection.  For they
reject the mystery of man’s salvation and refuse to believe that Christ
our <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxiii-p22.4"></span>Lord</span> in
the true flesh of our nature was truly born, truly suffered, was truly
buried and was truly raised.  And in consequence, condemn the day of our
rejoicing by the gloom of their fasting.  And since to conceal their
infidelity they dare to be present at our meetings, at the Communion of
the Mysteries <span id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930.md) they bring
themselves sometimes, in order to ensure their concealment, to receive
Christ’s Body with unworthy lips, though they altogether refuse to drink
the Blood of our Redemption.  And this we make known to you, holy
brethren, that men of this sort may be detected by you by these signs,
and that they whose impious pretences have been discovered may be driven
from the society of the saints by priestly authority.  For of such the
blessed Apostle Paul in his foresight warns <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p23.1"></span>God’s</span> Church, saying:  “but we
beseech you, brethren, that ye observe those who make discussions and
offences contrary to the doctrine which ye learnt and turn away from
them.  For such persons serve not Christ the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p23.2"></span>Lord</span> but their own belly, and by
sweet words and fair speeches beguile the hearts of the innocent <span
id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931.md) .”

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p25"></span>VI.  *Make your fasting a reality by
amendment in your lives.*

<span id="ii.v.xxiii-p26"></span>Being therefore, dearly-beloved, fully
instructed by these admonitions of ours, which we have often repeated in
your ears in protest against abominable error, enter upon the holy days
of Lent with Godly devoutness, and prepare yourselves to win <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxiii-p26.1"></span>God’s</span> mercy by your
own works of mercy.  Quench your anger, wipe out enmities, cherish
unity, and vie with one another in the offices of true humility.  Rule
your slaves and those who are put under you with fairness, let none of
them be tortured by imprisonment or chains.  Forego vengeance, forgive
offences:  exchange severity for gentleness, indignation for meekness,
discord for peace.  Let all men find us self-restrained, peaceable,
kind:  that our fastings may be acceptable to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p26.2"></span>God</span>.  For in a word to Him we offer
the sacrifice of true abstinence and true Godliness, when we keep
ourselves from all evil:  the Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxiii-p26.3"></span>God</span> helping us through all, to Whom
with the Son and Holy Spirit belongs one Godhead and one Majesty, for
ever and ever.  Amen.
