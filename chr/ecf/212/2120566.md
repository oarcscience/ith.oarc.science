<span id="iii.v.viii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.viii.v-p1.1"></span>Epistle VI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.v-p2"></span>To Amos, Patriarch of Jerusalem.

<span id="iii.v.viii.v-p3"></span>Gregory to Amos, Bishop of Jerusalem.

<span id="iii.v.viii.v-p4"></span>Being confident that your Fraternity
pays regard to the ordinances of the canons and the vigour of
discipline, lest the falseness of one of your clerics should succeed in
imposing on you so as to escape the strictness of ecclesiastical order,
we have thought it right to inform you of his fault, that through your
solicitude he may be subjected to the discipline from which he has
fled.  We understand, then, that Peter, an acolyte, whom we had caused
to serve under our son the deacon Sabinianus, our ecclesiastical
representative in the royal city, has fled, and resorted to your
Church.  If this is true, let your Fraternity be at pains to secure him,
and send him back hither when <span id="page_234b">p. 234b</span> <span
id="iii.v.viii.v-Page_234b"></span>an opportunity occurs.  But if by
chance, fearing this, he shall have departed from your Church, and be
lurking in various places to escape detection, order him to be
diligently sought for in all your parishes, and, when found, send him
back to us, as we have before said.  And we desire also to notify
through you that he is deprived of communion:  nor let him dare to
receive the mysteries of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.v-p4.1"></span>Lord’s</span> body and blood until he
shall return to us, unless by chance he should be in imminent peril of
death.
