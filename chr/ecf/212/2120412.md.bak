id="iii.v.iii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle LI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxvi-p2"></span>To Maximianus, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxvi-p3"></span>Gregory to Maximinianus, Bishop of
Syracuse <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md) .

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxvi-p5"></span>My brethren who live with me
familiarly urge me by all means to write something briefly about the
miracles of the Fathers done in Italy, which we have heard of.  With
this view I am in great need of the assistance of your Charity, to
mention to me shortly what comes back to your memory, and what you
happen to have known.  For I remember your telling me something, which I
have now forgotten, about the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xxvi-p5.1"></span>Lord <span
id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md) </span> Abbot Nonnosus, who was
with the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xxvi-p6.1"></span>Lord <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md) </span> Anastasius of Pentomi <span
id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md) .  And therefore this, or anything
else, I beg thee to communicate to me by letter without delay, if indeed
thou art not intending to come to me thyself shortly.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxvi-p8"></span> The miracles attributed to
Nonnosus, which are here referred to, are told in *Dialog*. I. 7, as
having been communicated to Gregory by Maximianus and an old monk called
Laurio.  Nonnosos, at the time when they were wrought, had been Prior
under Anastasius of a monastery on the summit of Mount Soracte.
