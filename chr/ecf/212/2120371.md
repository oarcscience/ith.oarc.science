<span id="iii.v.ii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.xvi-p2"></span>To Maurilius and Vitalianus.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xvi-p3"></span>Gregory to Maurilius and Vitalianus,
*magistris militum* <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416) .

<span id="iii.v.ii.xvi-p5"></span>We have entreated your Glory through
our son Vitalianus both by word and letter, charging you to communicate
with him.  But on the eleventh day of the month of January <span
id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417) Ariulph sent us this letter which
we forward to you.  Wherefore, when you have read it, see if the people
of Suana <span id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418) have stood fast in
the fidelity they promised to the republic, and take adequate hostages
from them, such as you can rely on; and moreover bind them anew by
oaths, restoring to them what you took from them in the way of a pledge,
and bringing them to a right mind by your discourses.  But, should you
quite distinctly ascertain that they have treated with Ariulph about
their surrender to him, or at any rate have given him hostages, as the
letter of Ariulph which we have forwarded to you leads us to suspect,
then (after wholesome deliberation, lest your souls or mine be burdened
with respect to our oaths), do ye whatever ye may judge to be of
advantage to the republic.  But let your Glory so act that neither
anything be done for which we could be blamed by our adversaries, nor
(which may the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xvi-p7.1"></span>Lord</span> avert) anything neglected
which the advantage of the republic requires.  Furthermore, my glorious
sons, take anxious heed, since the enemy, so far as I have ascertained,
has an army collected, and is said to be stationed at Narina <span
id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419) ; and if, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xvi-p8.1"></span>God</span> being <span id="page_108b">p.
108b</span> <span id="iii.v.ii.xvi-Page_108b"></span>angry with him, he
should resolve to bend his course hitherward, do you plunder his
positions so far as the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xvi-p8.2"></span>Lord</span> may aid you, or certainly let
those whom you send carefully require night-watches <span
id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420) , lest news of any sad event should
reach us <span id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421) .
