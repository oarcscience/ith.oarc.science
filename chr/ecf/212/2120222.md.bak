<span id="ii.v.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xliv-p1.1"></span>Sermon LXXXV.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xliv-p2.1"></span>On the Feast of S. Laurence the Martyr <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[1177](#fn_1176) (Aug. 10.md).</span>

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p4"></span>I.  *The example of the martyrs is most
valuable.*

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p5"></span>Whilst the height of all virtues,
dearly-beloved, and the fulness of all righteousness is born of that
love, wherewith <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xliv-p5.1"></span>God</span> and one’s neighbour is loved,
surely in none is this love found more conspicuous and brighter than in
the blessed martyrs; who are as near to our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xliv-p5.2"></span>Lord</span> Jesus, Who died for all men, in
the imitation of His love, as in the likeness of their suffering.  For,
although that Love, wherewith the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xliv-p5.3"></span>Lord</span> has redeemed us, cannot be
equalled by any man’s kindness, because it is one thing that a man who
is doomed to die one day should die for a righteous man, and another
that One Who is free from the debt of sin should lay down His life for
the wicked <span id="fr_1177"></span>[1178](#fn_1177.md) :  yet the martyrs
also have done great service to all men, in that the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xliv-p6.2"></span>Lord</span> Who gave them
boldness, has used it to show that the penalty of death and the pain of
the cross need not be terrible to any of His followers, but might be
imitated by many of them.  If therefore no good man is good for himself
alone, and no wise man’s wisdom befriends himself only, and the nature
of true virtue is such that it leads many away from the dark error on
which its light is shed, no model is more useful in teaching <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xliv-p6.3"></span>God’s</span> people than
that of the martyrs.  Eloquence may make intercession easy, reasoning
may effectually persuade; but yet examples are stronger than words, and
there is more teaching in practice than in precept.

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p7"></span>II.  *The Saint’s martyrdom described.*

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p8"></span>And how gloriously strong in this most
excellent manner of doctrine the blessed martyr Laurentius is, by whose
sufferings to-day is marked, even his persecutors were able to feel,
when they found that his wondrous courage, born principally of love for
Christ, not only did not yield itself, but also strengthened others by
the example of his endurance.  For when the fury of the gentile
potentates was raging against Christ’s most chosen members, and attacked
those especially who were of priestly rank, the wicked persecutor’s
wrath was vented on Laurentius the deacon, who was pre-eminent not only
in the performance of the sacred rites, but also in the management of
the church’s property <span id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178.md) ,
promising himself double spoil from one man’s capture:  for if he forced
him to surrender the sacred treasures, he would also drive him out of
the pale of true religion.  And so this man, so greedy of money and such
a foe to the truth, arms himself with double weapon:  with avarice to
plunder the gold; with impiety to carry off Christ.  He demands of the
guileless guardian of the sanctuary that the church wealth on which his
greedy mind was set should be brought to him.  But the holy deacon
showed him where he had them stored, by pointing to the many troops of
poor saints, in the feeding and clothing of whom he had a store of
riches which he could not lose, and which were the more entirely safe
that the money had been spent on so holy a cause.

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p10"></span>III.  *The description of his sufferings
continued.*

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p11"></span>The baffled plunderer, therefore, frets,
and blazing out into hatred of a religion, which had put riches to such
a use, determines to <span id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span
id="ii.v.xliv-Page_198"></span>pillage a still greater treasure by
carrying off that sacred deposit <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179.md) , wherewith he was enriched, as he
could find no solid hoard of money in his possession.  He orders
Laurentius to renounce Christ, and prepares to ply the deacon’s stout
courage with frightful tortures:  and, when the first elicit nothing,
fiercer follow.  His limbs, torn and mangled by many cutting blows, are
commanded to be broiled upon the fire in an iron framework <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180.md) , which was of itself already hot
enough to burn him, and on which his limbs were turned from time to
time, to make the torment fiercer, and the death more lingering.

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p14"></span>IV.  *Laurentius has conquered his
persecutor.*

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p15"></span>Thou gainest nothing, thou prevailest
nothing, O savage cruelty.  His mortal frame is released from thy
devices, and, when Laurentius departs to heaven, thou art vanquished. 
The flame of Christ’s love could not be overcome by thy flames, and the
fire which burnt outside was less keen than that which blazed within. 
Thou didst but serve the martyr in thy rage, O persecutor:  thou didst
but swell the reward in adding to the pain.  For what did thy cunning
devise, which did not redound to the conqueror’s glory, when even the
instruments of torture were counted as part of the triumph?  Let us
rejoice, then, dearly-beloved, with spiritual joy, and make our boast
over the happy end of this illustrious man in the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xliv-p15.1"></span>Lord</span>, Who is “wonderful in His
saints <span id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181.md) ,” in whom He has
given us a support and an example, and has so spread abroad his glory
throughout the world, that, from the rising of the sun to its going
down, the brightness of his deacon’s light doth shine, and Rome is
become as famous in Laurentius as Jerusalem was ennobled by Stephen.  By
his prayer and intercession <span id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182.md)
we trust at all times to be assisted; that, because all, as the Apostle
says, “who wish to live holily in Christ, suffer persecution <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183.md) ,” we may be strengthened with the
spirit of love, and be fortified to overcome all temptations by the
perseverance of steadfast faith.  Through our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xliv-p18.2"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p3"></span> S. Laurence was the chief Deacon in the
time of Sextus II., and was martyred in the persecution of Valerian,
258, in the way detailed by Leo in this Sermon.  His was a very
favourite festival in the Middle Ages both in the East and West.

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p9"></span> It will be remembered that “the serving
of tables” was from the first institution of the office one of the
principal duties of the deacon (*levita*), see [Acts vi.

This side of the office has latterly fallen into abeyance and is but
slightly recognized in the English Ordinal.
