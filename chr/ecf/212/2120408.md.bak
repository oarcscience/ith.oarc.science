<span id="iii.v.iii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLVI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxii-p2"></span>To John, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxii-p3"></span>Gregory to John, Bishop of
Calliopolis \[*Gallipoli, in Calabria*\].

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxii-p4"></span>From the reports sent to us by thy
Fraternity it appears that Andrew, our brother and fellow-bishop,
undoubtedly had a concubine.  But, since it is uncertain whether he has
touched her while constituted in sacred orders, it is necessary that
thou shouldest warn him with earnest exhortation that, if he knows
himself to have had intercourse with her while in sacred orders, he
should retire from the office which he holds, and minister no longer. 
And if, though conscious of having done this thing, he should conceal
his sin and presume to minister, let him know that peril hangs over his
soul in the divine judgment.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxii-p5"></span>As to the woman on the Church-roll,
whom he caused to be chastised with cudgels, though we do not believe
that she died eight months afterwards, yet, since he caused her to be
thus punished inconsistently with his sacred calling, do thou suspend
him for two months from the solemnization of mass, that at any rate this
disgrace may teach him how to behave himself in future.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxii-p6"></span>Moreover, the clergy of the
aforesaid bishop, in a petition presented to us, which is subjoined
below, allege that they endure much ill-treatment from him.  Wherefore
let thy Fraternity take care to ascertain all these things accurately,
and so to correct and arrange them in a reasonable way that they may be
under no necessity hereafter of resorting hither on account of this
matter.  In the month of July, indiction 11.
