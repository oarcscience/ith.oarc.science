id="iii.v.iv.i-p2.1"></span>Epistle I.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.i-p3"></span>To Constantius, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iv.i-p4"></span>Gregory to Constantius, Bishop of
Mediolanum (*Milan*).

<span id="iii.v.iv.i-p5"></span>On receiving the letters of your
Fraternity I returned great thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.i-p5.1"></span>God</span>, that I was counted worthy to be
refreshed by the celebration of your ordination.  Truly that all, by the
gift of <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.i-p5.2"></span>God</span>,
with one accord concurred in your election, is a fact which thy
Fraternity ought with the utmost consideration to estimate, since, after
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.i-p5.3"></span>God</span>, you are
greatly indebted to those who with so submissive a disposition desired
you to be preferred before themselves.

<span id="iii.v.iv.i-p6"></span>It becomes you, therefore, with priestly
benignity to respond to their behaviour, and with kind sympathy to
attend to their needs.  If perchance there are any faults in any of
them, rebuke these with well-considered reproofs, so that your very
priestly indignation be mingled with a savour of sweetness, and that so
you may be loved by your subjects even when you are greatly feared. 
Such conduct will also induce great reverence for your person in their
judgment; since, as hasty and habitual rage is despised, so discriminate
indignation against faults for the most part becomes the formidable in
proportion as it has been slow.

<span id="iii.v.iv.i-p7"></span>Further, John our subdeacon, who has
returned, has reported many good things of you as to which we beseech
Almighty <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.i-p7.1"></span>God</span>
Himself to fulfil what He has begun; to the end that He may shew thee to
have advanced in good inwardly and outwardly both now among men and
hereafter among the angels.

<span id="iii.v.iv.i-p8"></span>Moreover, we have sent thee, according
to custom, a pallium to be used in the sacred solemnities of mass.  But
I beg you, when you receive it, to vindicate its dignity and its meaning
by humility.
