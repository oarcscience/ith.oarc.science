id="ii.v.xlviii-p2.4"></span></span>

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p3"></span>I.  *Introduction of the subject.*

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p4"></span>When our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p4.1"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, beloved, was
preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, and was healing divers sicknesses
through the whole of Galilee, the fame of His mighty works had spread
into all Syria:  large crowds too from all parts of Judæa were flocking
to the heavenly Physician <span id="fr_1218"></span>[1219](#fn_1218.md) . 
For as human ignorance is slow in believing what it does not see, and in
hoping for what it does not know, those who were to be instructed in the
divine lore <span id="fr_1219"></span>[1220](#fn_1219.md) , needed to be
aroused by bodily benefits and visible miracles:  so that they might
have no doubt as to the wholesomeness of His teaching when they actually
experienced His benignant power.  And therefore that the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlviii-p6.3"></span>Lord</span> might use
outward healings as an introduction to inward remedies, and after
healing bodies might work cures in the soul, He separated Himself from
the surrounding crowd, ascended into the retirement of a neighbouring
mountain, and called His apostles to Him there, that from the height of
that mystic seat He might instruct them in the loftier doctrines,
signifying from the very nature of the place and act that He it was who
had once honoured Moses by speaking to him:  then indeed with a more
terrifying justice, but now with a holier mercifulness, that what had
been promised might be fulfilled when the Prophet Jeremiah says: 
“behold the days come when I will complete a new <span id="page_203">p.
203</span> <span id="ii.v.xlviii-Page_203"></span>covenant <span
id="fr_1220"></span>[1221](#fn_1220.md) for the house of Israel and for the
house of Judah.  After those days, saith the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p7.1"></span>Lord</span>, I will put My laws in their
minds <span id="fr_1221"></span>[1222](#fn_1221.md) , and in their heart
will I write them <span id="fr_1222"></span>[1223](#fn_1222.md) .”  He
therefore who had spoken to Moses, spoke also to the apostles, and the
swift hand of the Word wrote and deposited the secrets of the new
covenant <span id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223.md) in the disciples’
hearts:  there were no thick clouds surrounding Him as of old, nor were
the people frightened off from approaching the mountain by frightful
sounds and lightning <span id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224.md) , but
quietly and freely His discourse reached the ears of those who stood
by:  that the harshness of the law might give way before the gentleness
of grace, and “the spirit of adoption” might dispel the terrors of
bondage <span id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p13"></span>II.  *The blessedness of humility
discussed.*

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p14"></span>The nature then of Christ’s teaching
is attested by His own holy statements:  that they who wish to arrive at
eternal blessedness may understand the steps of ascent to that high
happiness.  “Blessed,” He saith, “are the poor in spirit, for theirs is
the kingdom of heaven <span id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226.md) .”  It
would perhaps be doubtful what poor He was speaking of, if in saying
“blessed are the poor” He had added nothing which would explain the sort
of poor:  and then that poverty by itself would appear sufficient to win
the kingdom of heaven which many suffer from hard and heavy necessity. 
But when He says “blessed are the poor *in spirit*,” He shows that the
kingdom of heaven must be assigned to those who are recommended by the
humility of their spirits rather than by the smallness of their means. 
Yet it cannot be doubted that this possession of humility is more easily
acquired by the poor than the rich:  for submissiveness is the companion
of those that want, while loftiness of mind dwells with riches <span
id="fr_1227"></span>[1228](#fn_1227.md) .  Notwithstanding, even in many of
the rich is found that spirit which uses its abundance not for the
increasing of its pride but on works of kindness, and counts that for
the greatest gain which it expends in the relief of others’ hardships. 
It is given to every kind and rank of men to share in this virtue,
because men may be equal in will, though unequal in fortune:  and it
does not matter how different they are in earthly means, who are found
equal in spiritual possessions.  Blessed, therefore, is poverty which is
not possessed with a love of temporal things, and does not seek to be
increased with the riches of the world, but is eager to amass heavenly
possessions.

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p17"></span>III.  *Scriptural examples of
humility.*

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p18"></span>Of this high-souled humility the
Apostles first <span id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228.md) , after the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlviii-p19.3"></span>Lord</span>, have
given us example, who, leaving all that they had without difference at
the voice of the heavenly Master, were turned by a ready change from the
catching of fish to be fishers of men, and made many like themselves
through the imitation of their faith, when with those first-begotten
sons of the Church, “the heart of all was one, and the spirit one, of
those that believed <span id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229.md) :”  for
they, putting away the whole of their things and possessions, enriched
themselves with eternal goods, through the most devoted poverty, and in
accordance with the Apostles’ preaching rejoiced to have nothing of the
world and possess all things with Christ.  Hence the blessed Apostle
Peter, when he was going up into the temple, and was asked for alms by
the lame man, said, “Silver and gold is not mine, but what I have that I
give thee:  in the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and
walk <span id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230.md) .”  What more sublime
than this humility? what richer than this poverty?  He hath not stores
of money <span id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231.md) , but he hath gifts
of nature.  He whom his mother had brought forth lame from the womb, is
made whole by Peter with a word; and he who gave not Cæsar’s image in a
coin, restored Christ’s image on the man.  And by the riches of this
treasure not he only was aided whose power of walking was restored, but
5,000 men also, who then believed at the Apostle’s exhortation on
account of the wonder of this cure.  And that poor man who had not what
to give to the asker, bestowed so great a bounty of Divine Grace, that,
as he had set one man straight on his feet, so he healed these many
thousands of believers in their hearts, and made them “leap as an hart”
in Christ whom he had found limping in Jewish unbelief.

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p23"></span>IV.  *The blessedness of mourning
discussed.*

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p24"></span>After the assertion of this most happy
humility, the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p24.1"></span>Lord</span> hath added, saying, “Blessed
are they which mourn, for they shall be comforted <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232.md) .”  This mourning, beloved, to
which eternal comforting is promised, is not the same as the affliction
of this world:  nor do those laments which are <span id="page_204">p.
204</span> <span id="ii.v.xlviii-Page_204"></span>poured out in the
sorrowings of the whole human race make any one blessed.  The reason for
holy groanings, the cause of blessed tears, is very different. 
Religious grief mourns sin either that of others’ or one’s own:  nor
does it mourn for that which is wrought by <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p25.2"></span>God’s</span> justice, but it laments over
that which is committed by man’s iniquity, where he that does wrong is
more to be deplored than he who suffers it, because the unjust man’s
wrongdoing plunges him into punishment, but the just man’s endurance
leads him on to glory.

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p26"></span>V.  *The blessedness of the meek.*

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p27"></span>Next the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p27.1"></span>Lord</span> says:  “blessed are the meek,
for they shall possess the earth by inheritance <span
id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233.md) .”  To the meek and gentle, to the
humble and modest, and to those who are prepared to endure all injuries,
the earth is promised for their possession.  And this is not to be
reckoned a small or cheap inheritance, as if it were distinct from our
heavenly dwelling, since it is no other than these who are understood to
enter the kingdom of heaven.  The earth, then, which is promised to the
meek, and is to be given to the gentle in possession, is the flesh of
the saints, which in reward for their humility will be changed in a
happy resurrection, and clothed with the glory of immortality, in
nothing now to act contrary to the spirit, and to be in complete unity
and agreement with the will of the soul <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234.md) .  For then the outer man will be
the peaceful and unblemished possession of the inner man:  then the
mind, engrossed in beholding <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p29.1"></span>God</span>, will be hampered by no
obstacles of human weakness nor will it any more have to be said “The
body which is corrupted, weigheth upon the soul, and its earthly house
presseth down the sense which thinketh many things <span
id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235.md) :”  for the earth will not struggle
against its tenant, and will not venture on any insubordination against
the rule of its governor.  For the meek shall possess it in perpetual
peace, and nothing shall be taken from their rights, “when this
corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have
put on immortality <span id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236.md) :”  that
their danger may turn into reward, and what was a burden become an
honour <span id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p33"></span>VI.  *The blessedness of desiring
righteousness.*

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p34"></span>After this the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p34.1"></span>Lord</span> goes on to say:  “blessed are
they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be
satisfied <span id="fr_1238"></span>[1239](#fn_1238.md) .”  It is nothing
bodily, nothing earthly, that this hunger, this thirst seeks for:  but
it desires to be satiated with the good food of righteousness, and wants
to be admitted to all the deepest mysteries, and be filled with the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlviii-p35.2"></span>Lord</span>
Himself.  Happy the mind that craves this food and is eager for such
drink:  which it certainly would not seek for if it had never tasted of
its sweetness.  But hearing the Prophet’s spirit saying to him:  “taste
and see that the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p35.3"></span>Lord</span> is sweet <span
id="fr_1239"></span>[1240](#fn_1239.md) ;” it has received some portion of
sweetness from on high, and blazed out into love of the purest pleasure,
so that spurning all things temporal, it is seized with the utmost
eagerness for eating and drinking righteousness, and grasps the truth of
that first commandment which says:  “Thou shalt love the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlviii-p36.3"></span>Lord</span> thy <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlviii-p36.4"></span>God</span> out of all thy
heart, and out of all thy mind, and out of all thy strength <span
id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240.md) :”  since to love <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlviii-p37.3"></span>God</span> is nothing
else but to love righteousness <span
id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241.md) .  In fine, as in that passage the
care for one’s neighbour is joined to the love of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p38.5"></span>God</span>, so, too, here the virtue of
mercy is linked to the desire for righteousness, and it is said:

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p39"></span>VII.  *The blessedness of the
merciful.*

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p40"></span>“Blessed are the merciful, for <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlviii-p40.1"></span>God</span> shall have
mercy on them <span id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242.md) .”  Recognize,
Christian, the worth of thy wisdom, and understand to what rewards thou
art called, and by what methods of discipline thou must attain thereto. 
Mercy wishes thee to be merciful, righteousness to be righteous, that
the Creator may be seen in His creature, and the image of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlviii-p41.2"></span>God</span> may be
reflected in the mirror of the human heart expressed by the lines of
imitation.  The faith of those who do good <span
id="fr_1243"></span>[1244](#fn_1243.md) is free from anxiety:  thou shalt
have all thy desires, and shalt obtain without end what thou lovest. 
And since through thine alms-giving all things are pure to thee, to that
blessedness also thou shalt attain which is promised in consequence
where the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p42.2"></span>Lord</span> says:

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p43"></span>VIII.  *The blessedness of a pure
heart.*

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p44"></span>“Blessed are the pure in heart, for
they shall <span id="page_205">p. 205</span> <span
id="ii.v.xlviii-Page_205"></span>see <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p44.1"></span>God <span
id="fr_1244"></span>[1245](#fn_1244.md) </span>.”  Great is the happiness,
beloved, of him for whom so great a reward is prepared.  What, then, is
it to have the heart pure, but to strive after those virtues which are
mentioned above?  And how great the blessedness of seeing <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlviii-p45.2"></span>God</span>, what mind can
conceive, what tongue declare?  And yet this shall ensue when man’s
nature is transformed, so that no longer “in a mirror,” nor “in a
riddle,” but “face to face <span id="fr_1245"></span>[1246](#fn_1245.md) ”
it sees the very Godhead “as He is <span
id="fr_1246"></span>[1247](#fn_1246.md) ,” which no man could see <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[1248](#fn_1247.md) ; and through the unspeakable joy
of eternal contemplation obtains that “which eye has not seen, nor ear
heard, neither has entered into the heart of man <span
id="fr_1248"></span>[1249](#fn_1248.md) .”  Rightly is this blessedness
promised to purity of heart.  For the brightness of the true light will
not be able to be seen by the unclean sight:  and that which will be
happiness to minds that are bright and clean, will be a punishment to
those that are stained.  Therefore, let the mists of earth’s vanities be
shunned, and your inward eyes purged from all the filth of wickedness,
that the sight may be free to feed on this great manifestation of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlviii-p49.2"></span>God</span>.  For to the
attainment of this we understand what follows to lead.

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p50"></span>IX.  *The blessedness of
peace-making.*

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p51"></span>“Blessed are the peace-makers, for
they shall be called the sons of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p51.1"></span>God <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249.md) </span>.”  This blessedness,
beloved, belongs not to any and every kind of agreement and harmony, but
to that of which the Apostle speaks:  “have peace towards <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlviii-p52.2"></span>God <span
id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250.md) </span>;” and of which the Prophet
David speaks:  “Much peace have they that love Thy law, and they have no
cause of offences <span id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251.md) .”  This
peace even the closest ties of friendship and the exactest likeness of
mind do not really gain, if they do not agree with <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlviii-p54.2"></span>God’s</span> will. 
Similarity of bad desires, leagues in crimes, associations of vice,
cannot merit this peace.  The love of the world does not consort with
the love of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p54.3"></span>God</span>, nor doth he enter the alliance
of the sons of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p54.4"></span>God</span> who will not separate himself
from the children of this generation. <span
id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252.md)   Whereas they who are in mind
always with <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p55.1"></span>God</span>, “giving diligence to keep the
unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace <span
id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253.md) ,” never dissent from the eternal
law, uttering that prayer of faith, “Thy will be done as in heaven so on
earth <span id="fr_1254"></span>[1255](#fn_1254.md) .”  These are “the
peacemakers,” these are thoroughly of one mind, and fully harmonious,
and are to be called sons “of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p57.2"></span>God</span> and joint-heirs with
Christ <span id="fr_1255"></span>[1256](#fn_1255.md) ,” because this shall
be the record of the love of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p58.2"></span>God</span> and the love of our neighbour,
that we shall suffer no calamities, be in fear of no offence, but all
the strife of trial ended, rest in <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p58.3"></span>God’s</span> most perfect peace, through
our <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlviii-p58.4"></span>Lord</span>,
Who, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, liveth and reigneth for ever
and ever.  Amen.

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p28"></span> S. [Matt. v.
5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.v.xlviii-p28.1"></span>.  It will be observed that Leo’s order
for the 2nd and 3rd beatitudes is that of the English version, *not*
that of the Vulgate.

<span id="ii.v.xlviii-p29"></span> *In nullo iam spiritui futura
contraria et cum voluntate animi perfectæ unitatis habitura consensum*: 
compare S. Aug. *de Fide et symbolo*, cap. 23, “*est autem animæ natura
perfecta cum spiritui suo subditur et cum sequitur sequentum Deum—non
est desperandum etiam corpus restitui naturæ propriæ—tempore opportuno
in novissima tuba, cum mortui resurgent incorrupti et nos
immutabimur*.”  The interpretation of this beatitude in this way is
fantastic, and very strange to modern notions.
