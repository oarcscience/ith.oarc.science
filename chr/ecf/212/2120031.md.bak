<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Letter XXI.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p2.1"></span>From Eutyches to Leo <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) .</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p4"></span>I.  *He states his account of the
proceedings at the Synod.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p5.1"></span>God</span> the Word is before all else my
witness, <span id="page_33">p. 33</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xxi-Page_33"></span>being confident of my hope and faith in
Christ the <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxi-p5.2"></span>Lord</span>
and <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxi-p5.3"></span>God</span> of all,
and discerning the proof of my holding the truth in these matters:  but
I call on your holiness, too, to bear witness to my heart and to the
reasonableness of my opinions and words.  But the wicked devil has
exercised his evil influence upon my zeal and determination, whereby his
power ought to have been destroyed.  Whereupon he has exerted all his
proper power and aroused Eusebius, bishop of the town of Dorylæum,
against me, who presented an allegation <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) to the holy bishop of the church in
Constantinople, Flavian, and to certain others whom he found in the same
city assembled on various matters of their own:  in this he called me
heretic, not raising any true accusation but contriving destruction for
me and disturbance for the churches of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p6.1"></span>God</span>.

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p7"></span>Their holinesses summoned me to reply to
his accusation:  but though I was delayed by a serious illness besides
my advanced age, I came to clear myself, knowing well that a faction had
been formed against my safety.  And, indeed, together with a writ of
appeal <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) to which my signature was
appended, I offered them a statement showing my confession upon the holy
Faith.  But when the holy Flavian did not receive the document, nor
order it to be read, yet heard me in reply utter word for word that
Faith which was put forth at Nicæa by the holy Synod, and confirmed at
Ephesus, I was required to acknowledge two natures, and to anathematize
those who denied this.  But I, fearing the decision of the synod, and
not wishing either to take away or to add one word contrary to the Faith
put forth by the holy Synod of Nicæa, knowing, too, that our holy and
blessed fathers and bishops Julius, Felix, Athanasius, and
Gregorius <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) rejected the phrase
“two natures,” and not daring to discuss the nature of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxi-p9.1"></span>God</span> the Word, who
came into flesh in the last days entering the womb of the holy virgin
Mary unchangeably as he willed and knew, becoming man in reality, not in
fancy, nor yet venturing to anathematize our aforesaid Fathers, I asked
them to let your holiness know these things, that you might judge what
seemed right to you, undertaking by all means to follow your ruling.

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p10"></span>II.  *His explanations were allowed no
hearing.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p11"></span>But without listening to any thing which
I said, they broke up the Synod and published the sentence of my
degradation, which they were getting ready against me before the
inquiry.  So much slander were they factiously making up against me that
even my safety would have been endangered had not the help of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxi-p11.1"></span>God</span> at the
intercession of your holiness quickly snatched me from the assault of
military force.  Then they began to force the heads of other
monasteries <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) to subscribe to my
degradation (a thing which was never done either towards those who have
professed themselves heretics, nor even against Nestorius himself),
insomuch that when to reassure the people I tried to set forth <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) statements of my faith, not only did
they, who were plotting the aforesaid faction against me, prevent them
being heard, but also seized them that straightway I might be held a
heretic before all.

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p14"></span>III.  *He appeals to Leo for
protection.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p15"></span>I take refuge, therefore, with you the
defender of religion and abhorrer of such factions, bringing in even
still nothing strange against the faith as it was originally handed down
to us, but anathematizing Apollinaris, Valentinus, Manes, and Nestorius,
and those who say that the flesh of our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p15.1"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, the Saviour,
descended from heaven and not from the Holy Ghost and from the holy
Virgin, along with all heresies down to Simon Magus.  Yet nevertheless I
stand in jeopardy of my life as a heretic.  I beseech you not to be
prejudiced against me by their insidious designs about me, but to
pronounce the sentence which shall seem to you right upon the Faith, and
in future not to allow any slander to be uttered against me by this
faction, nor let one be expelled and banished from the number of the
orthodox who has spent his seventy years of life in continence and all
chastity, so that at the very end of life he should suffer shipwreck.  I
have subjoined to this my letter both documents, that which was
presented by my accuser at the Synod, and that which was brought by me
but not received, as well as the statement of my faith and those things
which have been decreed upon the two natures by our holy Fathers <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) .

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p17"></span> <span id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xxi-Page_34"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p17.1"></span>Eutyches’ Confession of Faith.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p18"></span>I call upon you before <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxi-p18.1"></span>God</span>, who gives life
to all things, and Christ Jesus, who witnessed that good confession
under Pontius Pilate, that you do nothing by favour.  For I have held
the same as my forefathers and from my boyhood have been illuminated by
the same Faith as that which was laid down by the holy Synod of 318 most
blessed bishops who were gathered at Nicæa from the whole world, and
which was confirmed and ratified afresh for sole acceptance by the holy
Synod assembled at Ephesus:  and I have never thought otherwise than as
the right and only true orthodox Faith has enjoined.  And I agree to
everything that was laid down about the same Faith by the same holy
Synod:  of which Synod the leader and chief was Cyril of blessed memory
bishop of the Alexandrians, the partner and sharer in the preaching and
in the Faith of those saints and elect of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p18.2"></span>God</span>, Gregory the greater, and the
other Gregory <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) , Basil,
Athanasius, Atticus and Proclus.  Him and all of them I have held
orthodox and faithful, and have honoured as saints, and have esteemed my
masters.  But I utter an anathema on Nestorius, Apollinaris, and all
heretics down to Simon, and those who say that the flesh of our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxi-p19.1"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ
came down from heaven.  For He who is the Word of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p19.2"></span>God</span> came down from heaven without
flesh and was made flesh in the holy Virgin’s womb unchangeably and
unalterably as He Himself knew and willed.  And He who was always
perfect <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxi-p19.3"></span>God</span>
before the ages, was also made perfect man in the end of the days for us
and for our salvation.  This my full profession may your holiness
consider.

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p20"></span>I, Eutyches, presbyter and
archimandrite, have subscribed to this statement with my own hand.

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p3"></span> Contrary to my general plan, I have
thought it wiser, in the matter of the Eutychian controversy, to include
other than Leo’s own writings, that the reader may fulfil the precept
*audi alteram partem* in what was the most important doctrinal
discussion of Leo’s term of office.  This Letter (XXI.) bears the stamp
of genuineness upon it, though the Gk. original is not found.  It is
from a collection of documents bearing on Nestorianism published *ex
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxi-p3.1"></span>ms.</span> Casinensi,*
first by Christianus Lupus (?), and afterwards by Stephanus Baluzius
(1630–1718).

<span id="fn_213"></span>[33:214](2120031.htm#fr_213.md) <span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p5.4"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p6"></span> See Introduction, p. vii.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[33:215](2120031.htm#fr_214.md) <span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p8"></span> *Libelli* sc. (*appellationis ad
Leonem*):  this is referred to by Flavian (Lett. XXVI., chap. iii.) and
denied.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[33:216](2120031.htm#fr_215.md) <span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p9"></span> Of these four worthies, *Athanasius* is
too well known to need further notice.  *Gregorius* is either Greg.
Nazianzen, Bishop of Constantinople (circ. 380) or Greg. of Nyssa, both
great champions of the Church against Arianism (*not*, as the Ball.,
Greg. Thaumaturgus, Bishop of Neo-Cæsarea, 244–70):  *Julius* was a
Bishop of Rome (337–52):  an excerpt from one of his letters is printed
by the Ball. at the end of this letter as the passage on which Eutyches
based his error, though they suspect it (not unnaturally) as being an
Apollinarian imposition:  *Felix* is probably no other than the Arian
Bishop of Rome, Felix II. (355–8) whose appointment is characterized by
Athanasius as effected “by antichristian wickedness,” but who is yet a
canonized saint and martyr of the Roman Church (see Schaff’s Hist., vol.
ii. p. 371; iii. 635, 6).

<span id="fn_216"></span>[33:217](2120031.htm#fr_216.md) <span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p11.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p12"></span> Abbots’ signatures are found attached
to the condemnation of Eutyches by the synod of Constantinople.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[33:218](2120031.htm#fr_217.md) <span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p13"></span> Cf. Letter XXVI., chap. ii.,
*propositiones iniuriarum publice ponens et maledictionibus plenas* (Gr.
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iv.xxi-p13.1"></span>προθεμετα ὕβρεως
καὶ λοιοορίας ἀνάμεστα</span>) which is Flavian’s account of the matter.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[33:219](2120031.htm#fr_218.md) <span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p15.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p16"></span> Of these four documents (1) Eusebius’
*libellus* is preserved in Act I Chalcedon; (2) is not forthcoming; (3)
is appended below; and (4) a fragment of the testimony of Julius, which
is given, does not seem important enough to be added in this edition,
especially as its genuineness is denied.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[34:220](2120031.htm#fr_219.md) <span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p18.3"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p19"></span> Here we have the two Gregorys
mentioned:  cf. n. 7. above.
