<p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.vi.xli-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.vi.xli-p1.1"></A>Epistle LX.</span></p>  
<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vi.xli-p2"></A>To Eulogius, Bishop.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.xli-p3"></A>Gregory to Eulogius, Bishop of Alexandria.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xli-p4"></A>Charity, the mother and guardian of all that is good, which binds together in union the hearts of many, regards not as absent him whom it has present in the mind&#146;s eye.&#160; Since then, dearest brother, we are held together by the root of charity, neither will bodily absence nor distance of places have power to assert any claim over us, inasmuch as we who are one are surely not far from each other.&#160; Now we wish to have always this common charity with the rest of our brethren.&#160; Yet there is something that binds us in a certain peculiar way to the Church of Alexandria, and compels us, as it were by a special law, to be the more prone to love it.&#160; For, as it is known to all that the blessed evangelist Mark was sent by Saint Peter the apostle, his master, to Alexandria, so we are bound together in the unity of this master and his disciple, so that I seem to preside over the see of the disciple because of the master, and you over the see of the master because of the disciple.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xli-p5"></A>Moreover to this unity of hearts we are bound also by the merits of your Holiness, since we know that you follow profitably the ordinances of your founder, and feel how you betake yourself with entire devotion to the bosom of your master, whence sprung the preaching of salvation in your parts.&#160; And so, when we received the letters of your Holiness, as much as our heart rejoiced in your brotherly visitation, so much is it oppressed with sadness for the untold burdens which you refer to, and we groan with you in brotherly sympathy for your grief.&#160; But, since a shaking of various kinds is extending itself everywhere, in the midst of a common need one should grieve less for one&#146;s own, but study rather, by patiently enduring, to overcome what we cannot altogether avoid.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xli-p6"></A>But what we ourselves are suffering from the swords of the Lombards in the daily plundering and mangling and slaying of our citizens, we refuse to tell, lest, while speaking of our own sorrows, we should increase yours from the sympathy which you bestow upon us.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xli-p7"></A>Furthermore, a little time ago we sent to Sabinianus, who represents our Church in the royal city, a letter from ourselves, which he should have sent on to your Fraternity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1673"></A><A HREF="#fn_1673"><FONT SIZE="1">1674</FONT></A>
.&#160; If you have received it, we wonder why you have sent us no reply to it.&#160; And accordingly, since caution must be taken lest the pride of any one whatever introduce offence in the Churches, it is needful that you should carefully peruse it, and with all diligence and full bent of mind maintain what pertains to your dignity and to the peace of the Church.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xli-p9"></A>Now may Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xli-p9.1"></A>God</span>, who by the grace of His loving-kindness has conferred on you the disposition and charity that becomes a priest, protect you in His service, and keep you within and without from all adversity, and mercifully grant that the souls of wanderers may be converted to Himself by your preaching.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xli-p10"></A>We have received with the charity that was due to the bearer of these presents, our common son the deacon Isidore, who brought to us the benediction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1674"></A><A HREF="#fn_1674"><FONT SIZE="1">1675</FONT></A>
 of Saint Mark the evangelist.&#160; And you indeed, being resplendent in the merit of a good life, have sent to us the sweetly smelling word, which is nigh unto Paradise.&#160; But we, to wit because we are sinners, send you wood from the West, which,  <A NAME="page_207b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.vi.xli-Page_207b"></A>being suitable for the building of ships, signifies the tumult of our mind, as being ever tossed in the sea-waves; and we wished indeed to send larger pieces, but the ship was not large enough to hold them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1675"></A><A HREF="#fn_1675"><FONT SIZE="1">1676</FONT></A>
