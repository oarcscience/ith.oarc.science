id="iii.v.iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Epistle LIX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxx-p2"></span>To Secundinus, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxx-p3"></span>Gregory to Secundinus, Bishop of
Tauromenium.  \[*In Sicily*.\]

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxx-p4"></span>Some time ago we ordered that the
baptistery <span id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510) should be removed
from the monastery of Saint Andrew, which is above Mascalæ, because of
inconvenience to the monks, and that an altar should be erected in the
place where the fonts now are.  But the carrying out of this order has
been put off so far.  We therefore admonish thy Fraternity that thou
interpose no further delay after receiving this our letter, but that the
fonts themselves be filled up <span id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511)
, and an altar at once erected there for celebration of the sacred
mysteries; to the end that the aforesaid monks may be at liberty to
celebrate more securely the work of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xxx-p6.1"></span>God</span>, and that our mind be not
provoked against thy Fraternity for negligence.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxx-p5"></span> Baptisteries (*baptisteria*) were
anciently separate buildings adjoining churches (cf. VI. 22), the
*fontes* being the pools of water (called also *piscinæ* and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.v.iii.xxx-p5.1"></span>κολυμβήθρα</span>)
therein contained.  (See Bingham, B. VIII. C. VII. *Sect*. 1, 4.)  The
inconvenience to the monks of having a baptistery at their monastery
would be from the concourse of people resorting to it, which would
interfere with monastic seclusion.  For a similar reason Gregory more
than once forbids public masses in monasteries.  Cf. e.g. II. 41; VI.
46.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxx-p6"></span> Fonts were anciently sunken pools. 
“In medio habet fontem in terra excavatam ad quinque ulnas…tribus
gradibus in id descensus est.”  *Onuphrius, de baptisterio Lateran*.
