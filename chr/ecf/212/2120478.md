id="iii.v.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLIX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xxiv-p2"></span>To Leander, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxiv-p3"></span>Gregory to Leander, Bishop of Hispalis
(*Seville*).

<span id="iii.v.v.xxiv-p4"></span>With what ardour I am athirst to see
thee thou readest in the tables of thine own heart, since thou lovest me
exceedingly.  But since I cannot see thee, separated as thou art from me
by long tracts of country, I have done what charity towards thee
dictated, namely to transmit to thy Holiness, on the arrival here of our
common son Probinus the presbyter, the book of Pastoral Rule, which I
wrote at the commencement of my episcopate, and the books which thou
knewest I had already composed on the exposition of the blessed Job. 
Some sheets indeed of the third and fourth parts of that work I have not
sent to thy Charity, having already given those sheets only of the said
parts to monasteries.  These, then, which I send let thy Holiness
earnestly peruse, and more earnestly deplore my sins, lest it be to my
more serious blame that I am seen as it were to know what I omit to do. 
But with how great tumults of business I am oppressed in this Church the
very brevity of my epistle will signify to thy Charity, seeing that I
say so little to him whom more than all I love.
