<span id="iii.v.vii.viii-p2"></span>To Fortunatus, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.vii.viii-p3"></span>Gregory to Fortunatus, Bishop of
Fanum <span id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691) .

<span id="iii.v.vii.viii-p5"></span>As it is reprehensible and deserving
of punishment for any one to sell consecrated vessels except in cases
sanctioned by law and the sacred canons, so it is not a matter for
reproach or penalty if they should be disposed of with a compassionate
purpose for the redemption of captives.  Since, then, we find from the
information given us by your Fraternity that you have borrowed money for
the redemption of captives, and have not the means of repaying it, and
on this account desire, with our authority, to dispose of some
consecrated vessels,—in this case, seeing that the decrees of both the
laws and the canons approve, we have thought fit to lend our approval,
and grant you leave to dispose of the consecrated vessels.  But, lest
their sale should possibly lead to any ill-feeling against yourself,
they ought to be disposed of, up to the amount of the debt, in the
presence of John our *defensor*, and their price should be paid to the
creditors, to the end that, the business being completed with observance
of this kind, neither may the creditors feel loss from having lent the
money, nor your Fraternity sustain ill-will now or at any future time.
