<span id="iii.v.iv.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Epistle III.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.iii-p2"></span>To Constantius, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iv.iii-p3"></span>Gregory to Constantius, Bishop of
Mediolanum.

<span id="iii.v.iv.iii-p4"></span>It has come to my knowledge that
certain bishops of your diocese, seeking out rather than finding an
occasion, have attempted to sever themselves from the unity of your
Fraternity, saying that thou hadst given a security <span
id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523.md) at the Roman city for thy
condemnation of the three Chapters.  And the fact is that they say this
because they do not know how I am accustomed to trust thy Fraternity
even without security.  For if there had been need for anything of the
kind, your mere word of mouth could have been trusted.  I, however, do
not recollect any mention between us of the three Chapters either in
word or in writing.  But as for them, if they soon return from their
error, they should be spared, because, according to the saying of the
Apostle Paul, *They understand neither what they say nor whereof they
affirm* ([1 Tim. i. 7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.v.iv.iii-p5.1"></span>).  For we, truth guiding us and our
conscience bearing witness, declare that we keep the faith of the holy
synod of Chalcedon in all respects inviolate, and venture not to add
anything to, or to subtract anything from, its definition <span
id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524.md) .  But, if any one would fain take
upon himself to think anything, either more or less, contrary to it, and
to the faith of this same synod, we anathematize him without any
hesitation, and decree him to be alien from the bosom of Mother Church. 
Any one, therefore, whom this my confession does not bring to a right
mind, no longer loves the synod of Chalcedon, but hates the bosom of
Mother Church.  If then those who appear to have been thus daring have
presumed thus to speak in zeal of soul, it remains for them, having
received this satisfaction, to return to the unity of thy Fraternity,
and not divide themselves from the body of Christ, which is the holy
universal Church.

<span id="iii.v.iv.iii-p6"></span> The contention of those who
disapproved of the condemnation of “The Three Chapters” by the fifth
council was not only that the condemnation of deceased persons was wrong
as well as useless, but also that it impugned the faith of the Council
of Chalcedon.  For that Council had not condemned the writers who were
now condemned; and two of them, Theodoret of Cyrus and Ibas of Edessa,
had even appeared before it, and been accepted as orthodox.  Further,
the condemnation was regarded as a concession to the Monophysites who
had been condemned at Chalcedon, the writers in question having been
peculiarly obnoxious to the Monophysite party.  And it does appear to be
the case that a main motive of the Emperor Justinian in forcing the
condemnation of The Three Chapters on the Church had been to conciliate
the Monophysites, and to induce them to conform.  Hence Gregory’s
anxiety to shew that what had been done at the fifth did not touch the
faith as previously defined.
