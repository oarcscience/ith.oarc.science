<span id="iii.v.vi.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>Epistle VIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.vii-p2"></span>To the Bishops of Epirus.

<span id="iii.v.vi.vii-p3"></span>Gregory to Theodorus, Demetrius,
Philip, Zeno, and Alcissonus, Bishops of Epirus.

<span id="iii.v.vi.vii-p4"></span>The notification of your letters, most
dear brethren, has made known to us that our brother Andrew has, by the
favour of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.vii-p4.1"></span>God</span>, been solemnly ordained bishop
of the city of Nicopolis.  And, since you signify that his consecration
has taken place with the assent of the clergy and provincials, we
rejoice; and we pray that the good which you testify of him may remain
in him, and by the co-operation of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.vii-p4.2"></span>God’s</span> grace receive increase, since
the goodness of prelates is the safety of their subordinates.  It is
your duty then to make haste studiously to imitate what you show by your
praises to be pleasing to you in his person.  For it is faulty before
men and penal <span id="page_191b">p. 191b</span> <span
id="iii.v.vi.vii-Page_191b"></span>before <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.vii-p4.3"></span>God</span> for any one to be unwilling to
imitate the good that pleases him.  Wherefore let your obedience supply
credit to your testimony.  Let no one gainsay him in what, with
preservation of integrity, he may enjoin for the common profit of the
Church.  Let each one of you willingly exhibit his devotion that, while
there is among you priestly concord pleasing to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.vii-p4.4"></span>God</span> and constant, no ill feeling
may avail to loose you from the bond of mutual charity, or difference
disturb you.  For neither will there be access to your hearts for the
crafty foe, since he knows that he can in no degree be admitted or
received, where sincere charity finds place.

<span id="iii.v.vi.vii-p5"></span>Moreover be ye attentive, most dear
brethren, and bestow on the flock committed to you the vigilance which
ye have taken upon yourselves, and which ye owe; meet the frauds of the
enemy by attention and prayer.  Surrender with uncontaminated faith to
our <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.vii-p5.1"></span>God</span> the
people over which ye are, that your priestly office may avail you not
for a penalty but for a crown before the sight of the eternal Judge.

<span id="iii.v.vi.vii-p6"></span>Know ye then that we have sent a
pallium to the above-written Andrew our brother and fellow-bishop, and
have granted him all the privileges which our predecessors conferred on
his predecessors.

<span id="iii.v.vi.vii-p7"></span>Furthermore, it has come to our ears
that sacred orders in your parts are conferred for a consideration
given.  And, if this is so, I say it with tears, I declare it with
groans, &c.  \[See Lib. V. Ep. 53<span id="iii.v.vi.vii-p7.1"></span>,
to “become a heretic”\] <span id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md) .  On
this account I admonish and conjure you to be altogether attentive to
this, that no giving of a consideration, no favour, no supplication of
any persons whatsoever, put in any claim in regard to sacred orders, but
that one be promoted to this office whom gravity of manners and
behaviour commends.  For if, as we do not believe will be the case, we
should perceive anything of the kind to be done, we will correct it, as
is fit, with canonical severity.  Now may Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.vii-p8.1"></span>God</span>, who orders
all things wonderfully by the power of His wisdom, and guards what He
has ordered, grant unto you both to will and to do what He commands.
