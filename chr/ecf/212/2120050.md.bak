<span id="ii.iv.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xl-p1.1"></span>Letter XL.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xl-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xl-p2.1"></span>To the Bishops of the Province of Arles in
Gaul.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xl-p3"></span>To his well-beloved brethren Constantinus
Audentius, Rusticus, Auspicius, Nicetas, Nectarius, Florus, Asclepius,
Justus, Augustalis, Ynantius, and Chrysaphius <span
id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) , Leo the pope.

<span id="ii.iv.xl-p5"></span>He approves of their having unanimously
elected Ravennius, Bishop of Arles.

<span id="ii.iv.xl-p6"></span>We have just and reasonable reason for
rejoicing, when we learn that the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xl-p6.1"></span>Lord’s</span> priests have done what is
agreeable both to the rules of the Father’s canons and to the Apostles’
institutions.  For the whole body of the Church must needs increase with
a healthy growth, if the governing members excel in the strength of
their authority, and in peaceful management.  Accordingly, we ratify
with our sanction your good deed, brethren, in unanimously, on the death
of Hilary <span id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) of holy memory,
consecrating our brother Ravennius, a man well approved by us, in the
city of Arles, in accordance with the wishes of the clergy, the leading
citizens, and the laity.  Because a peace-making and harmonious
election, where neither personal merits nor the good will of the
congregation are wanting, is we believe the expression not only of man’s
choice, but of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xl-p7.1"></span>God’s</span> inspiration.  So dearly beloved
brethren, let the said priest use <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xl-p7.2"></span>God’s</span> gift, and understand what
self-devotion is expected of him, that by diligently and prudently
carrying out the office entrusted to him, he may prove himself equal to
your testimony, and fully worthy of our favour.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xl-p7.3"></span>God</span> keep you safe, beloved brethren. 
Dated 22 August in the consulship of Asturius and Protogenes (449).

<span id="ii.iv.xl-p4"></span> These twelve bishops do not include the
Bishop of Vienne, according to Perthel (p. 29), following apparently
Quesnel, whose wish-fathered thought, though possibly right, has little
evidence to go upon.  Cf. Letters LXV. and LXVI. below.

<span id="fn_364"></span>[51:365](2120050.htm#fr_364.md) <span
id="ii.iv.xl-p6.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xl-p7"></span> It will be noticed that Leo speaks of
Hilary not only with respect, but as if he acquiesced in his sentence
(passed against Hilary in Lett. X. above) not having been carried out.
