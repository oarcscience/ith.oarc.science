id="iii.v.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXIV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xvii-p2"></span>To Zabardas, Duke of Sardinia.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xvii-p3"></span>Gregory to Zabardas, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xvii-p4"></span>From the letters of my brother and
fellow-bishop Felix, and of the servant of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xvii-p4.1"></span>God</span>, Cyriacus, we have learnt your
Glory’s good qualities.  And we give great thanks to mighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xvii-p4.2"></span>God</span>, that
Sardinia has got such a duke; one who so knows how to do his duty to the
republic in earthly matters as to know also how to exhibit to Almighty
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xvii-p4.3"></span>God</span> dutiful
regard for the heavenly country.  For they have written to me that you
are arranging terms of peace with the Barbaricini on such conditions as
to bring these same Barbaricini to the service of Christ.  On this
account I rejoice exceedingly, and, should it please Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xvii-p4.4"></span>God</span>, will
speedily notify your gifts to our most serene princes.  Do you,
therefore, accomplish what you have begun, shew the devotion of your
heart to Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xvii-p4.5"></span>God</span>, and help to the utmost of
your power those whom we have sent to your parts for the conversion of
the Barbaricini <span id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md) ; knowing
that such works may avail much to aid you both before our earthly
princes and in the eyes of the heavenly king.
