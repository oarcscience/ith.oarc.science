<span id="iii.v.iv.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLVI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxxi-p2"></span>To Rusticiana, Patrician.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxxi-p3"></span>Gregory to Rusticiana, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxxi-p4"></span>On receiving your Excellency’s
letters I was glad to hear that you had reached Mount Sinai.  But
believe me, I too should have liked to go with you, but by no means to
return with you.  And yet I find it very difficult to believe that you
have been at the holy places and seen many Fathers.  For I believe that,
if you had seen them, you would by no means have been able to return so
speedily to the city of Constantinople.  But now that the love of such a
city has in no wise departed from your heart, I suspect that your
Excellency did not from the heart devote yourself to the holy things
which you saw with the bodily eye.  But may Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xxxi-p4.1"></span>God</span> illuminate
your mind by the grace of His lovingkindness and give unto you to be
wise, and to consider how fugitive are all temporal things, since, while
we are thus speaking, both time runs on and the Judge approaches, and lo
the moment is even now near when against our will we must give up the
world which of our own accord we will not.  I beg that the <span
id="page_161b">p. 161b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iv.xxxi-Page_161b"></span>lord Apio and the lady Eusebia, and
their daughters, be greeted in my behalf.  As to that lady my nurse,
whom you commend to me by letter, I have the greatest regard for her,
and desire that she should be in no way incommoded.  But we are pressed
by such great straits that we cannot excuse even ourselves from
exactions (*angariis*) <span id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md) and
burdens at this present time.

frequent occurrence, denotes exactions and forced services of various
kinds.
