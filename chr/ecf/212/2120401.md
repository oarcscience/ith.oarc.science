id="iii.v.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.xv-p2"></span>To Romanus, Patrician.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xv-p3"></span>Gregory to Romanus, Patrician, and
Exarch of Italy.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xv-p4"></span>We believe that your Excellency is
already aware of the death of Laurentius, bishop of the church of
Mediolanum.  And since, so far as we have learnt from the report of the
clergy, all have agreed in the election of our son Constantius, deacon
of the same church, it was necessary for us, for keeping up old usage,
to send a soldier of our church, to cause him in whose favour he finds
the will and consent of all to concur unanimously to be consecrated by
his own bishops, as ancient usage requires, though still with our
assent.  Wherefore, greeting you with fatherly affection as in duty
bound, we request your Excellency to vouchsafe your support, justice
approving, to the aforesaid Constantius, whether elected or not,
whenever need may arise; to the end that this service may both exalt you
here before your enemies, and commend you beforehand in the future life
before <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iii.xv-p4.1"></span>God</span>. 
For he is one of mine, and was once associated with me on very intimate
terms.  And you ought to hold as yours, and to love peculiarly, those
whom you know to be ours.
