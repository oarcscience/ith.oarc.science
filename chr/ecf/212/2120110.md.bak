<span id="ii.iv.c-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.c-p1.1"></span>Letter CV.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.c-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.c-p2.1"></span>(To Pulcheria Augusta about the self-seeking of
Anatolius.)</span>

<span id="ii.iv.c-p3"></span>Leo the bishop to Pulcheria Augusta.

<span id="ii.iv.c-p4"></span>I.  *He congratulates the Empress on the
triumph of the Faith, but regrets the introduction of a new controversy
into the Church.*

<span id="ii.iv.c-p5"></span>We rejoice ineffably with your Grace that
the catholic Faith has been defended against heretics and peace restored
to the whole Church through your clemency’s holy and God-pleasing zeal: 
giving thanks to the Merciful and Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.c-p5.1"></span>God</span> that He has suffered none save those
who loved darkness rather than light to be defrauded of the
gospel-truth:  so that by the removal of the mists of error the purest
light might arise in the hearts of all, and that darkness-loving foe
might not triumph over certain weak souls, whom not only those who stood
unhurt but also those whom he had made to totter have overcome, and that
by the abolition of error the true Faith might reign throughout the
world, and “every tongue might confess that the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.c-p5.2"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ is in the glory of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.c-p5.3"></span>God</span> the
Father <span id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md) .”  But when the whole
world had been confirmed in the unity of the Gospel, and the hearts of
all priests had been guided into the same belief, it had been better
that besides those matters for which the holy Synod was assembled, and
which were brought to a satisfactory agreement through your Grace’s
zeal, nothing should be introduced to counteract so great an advantage,
and that a council of bishops should not be made an occasion for the
inopportune advancing of an illegitimate desire.

<span id="ii.iv.c-p7"></span>II.  *The Nicene canons are unalterable and
binding universally.*

<span id="ii.iv.c-p8"></span>For my brother and fellow-bishop Anatolius
not sufficiently considering your Grace’s kindness and the favour of my
assent, whereby he gained the priesthood of the church of
Constantinople, instead of rejoicing at what he has gained, has been
inflamed with undue desires beyond the measure of his rank, believing
that his intemperate self-seeking could be advanced by the assertion
that certain persons had signified their assent thereto by an extorted
signature:  notwithstanding that my brethren and fellow-bishops, who
represented me, faithfully and laudably expressed their dissent from
these attempts which are doomed to speedy failure.  For no one may
venture upon anything in opposition to the enactments of the Fathers’
canons which many long years ago in the city of Nicæa were founded upon
the decrees of the Spirit, so that any one who wishes to pass any
different decree injures himself rather than impairs them.  And if all
pontiffs will but keep them inviolate as they should, there will be
perfect peace and complete harmony through all the churches:  there will
be no disagreements about rank, no disputes about ordinations, no
controversies about privileges, no strifes about taking that which is
another’s; but by the fair law of love a reasonable order will be kept
both in conduct and in office, and he will be truly great who is found
free from all self-seeking, as the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.c-p8.1"></span>Lord</span> says, “Whosoever will become
greater among you, let him be your minister, and whosoever will be first
among you shall be your slave; even as the Son of Man came not to be
ministered unto but to minister <span id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md)
.”  And yet these precepts were at the time given to men who <span
id="page_77">p. 77</span> <span id="ii.iv.c-Page_77"></span>wished to
rise from a mean estate and to pass from the lowest to the highest
things; but what more does the ruler of the church of Constantinople
covet than he has gained? or what will satisfy him, if the magnificence
and renown of so great a city is not enough?  It is too arrogant and
intemperate thus to step beyond all proper bounds and trampling on
ancient custom to wish to seize another’s right:  to increase one man’s
dignity at the expense of so many metropolitans’ primacy, and to carry a
new war of confusion into peaceful provinces which were long ago set at
rest by the enactments of the holy Nicene Synod:  to break through the
venerable Fathers’ decrees by alleging the consent of certain bishops,
which even the course of so many years has not rendered effective.  For
it is boasted that this has been winked at for almost 60 years now, and
the said bishop thinks that he is assisted thereby; but it is vain for
him to look for assistance from that which, even if a man dared to wish
for it, yet he could never obtain.

<span id="ii.iv.c-p10"></span>III. *Only by imitating his predecessor
will he regain Leo’s confidence:  the assent of the bishops is declared
null and void.*

<span id="ii.iv.c-p11"></span>Let him realize what a man he has
succeeded, and expelling all the spirit of pride let him imitate
Flavian’s faith, Flavian’s modesty, Flavian’s humility, which has raised
him right to a confessor’s glory.  If he will shine with his virtues, he
will merit all praise, and in all quarters he will win an abundance of
love not by seeking human advancement but by deserving Divine favour. 
And by this careful course I promise he will bind my heart also to him,
and the love of the Apostolic See, which we have ever bestowed on the
church of Constantinople, shall never be violated by any change. 
Because if sometimes rulers fall into errors through want of moderation,
yet the churches of Christ do not lose their purity.  But the bishops’
assents, which are opposed to the regulations of the holy canons
composed at Nicæa in conjunction with your faithful Grace, we do not
recognize, and by the blessed Apostle Peter’s authority we absolutely
dis-annul in comprehensive terms, in all ecclesiastical cases obeying
those laws which the Holy Ghost set forth by the 318 bishops for the
pacific observance of all priests in such sort that even if a much
greater number were to pass a different decree to theirs, whatever was
opposed to their constitution would have to be held in no respect.

<span id="ii.iv.c-p12"></span>IV.  *He requests the Empress to give his
letter her favourable consideration.*

<span id="ii.iv.c-p13"></span>And so I request your Grace to receive in
a worthy spirit this lengthy letter, in which I had to explain my views,
at the hands of my brother and fellow-bishop Lucianus, who, as far as in
him lies, has faithfully executed the anxious duties of his undertaking
as my delegate, and of my son Basil, the deacon.  And because it is your
habit to labour for the peace and unity of the Church, for his soul’s
health keep my brother Anatolius the bishop, to whom I have extended my
love by your advice, within those limits which shall be profitable to
him, that as your clemency’s glory is magnified already for the
restoration of the Faith, so it may be published abroad for the
restraint of self-seeking.  Dated the 22nd of May, in the consulship of
the illustrious Herculanus (452).
