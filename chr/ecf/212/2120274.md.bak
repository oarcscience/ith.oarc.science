<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p2"></span>How the slothful and the hasty are to
be admonished.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p3"></span>(*Admonition* 16.)  Differently to be
admonished are the slothful and the hasty.  For the <span
id="page_39b">p. 39b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-Page_39b"></span>former are to be persuaded not to
lose, by putting it off, the good they have to do; but the latter are to
be admonished lest, while they forestall the time of good deeds by
inconsiderate haste, they change their meritorious character.  To the
slothful therefore it is to be intimated, that often, when we will not
do at the right time what we can, before long, when we will, we cannot. 
For the very indolence of the mind, when it is not kindled with
befitting fervour, gets cut off by a torpor that stealthily grows upon
it from all desire of good things.  Whence it is plainly said through
Solomon, *Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep* ([Prov. xix.
15](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p3.1"></span>).  For the slothful one is as it were
awake in that he feels aright, though he grows torpid by doing nothing: 
but slothfulness is said to cast into a deep sleep, because by degrees
even the wakefulness of right feeling is lost, when zeal for well-doing
is discontinued.  And in the same place it is rightly added, *And a
dissolute soul shall suffer hunger* ([Prov.
19.15](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p3.2"></span>.).  For, because it braces not itself
towards higher things, it lets itself run loose uncared for in lower
desires; and, while not braced with the vigour of lofty aims, suffers
the pangs of the hunger of low concupiscence, and, in that it neglects
to bind itself up by discipline, it scatters itself the more abroad
hungry in its craving after pleasures.  Hence it is written again by the
same Solomon, *The idle man is wholly in desires* ([Prov. xxi.
26](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p3.3"></span>).  Hence in the preaching of the Truth
Himself ([Matt. 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#044.md),
[45](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#045.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p3.4"></span>) the house is said indeed to be clean
when one spirit has gone out; but, when empty, it is taken possession of
by his returning with many more.  For the most part the slothful, while
he neglects to do things that are necessary, sets before him some that
are difficult, but is inconsiderately afraid of others; and so, as
though finding something that he may reasonably fear, he satisfies
himself that he has good reason for remaining torpid.  To him it is
rightly said through Solomon, *The sluggard would not plough by reason
of the cold; therefore shall he beg in summer, and it shall not be given
unto him* ([Prov. xx. 4](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p3.5"></span>).  For indeed the sluggard ploughs not
by reason of the cold, when he finds an excuse for not doing the good
things which he ought to do.  The sluggard ploughs not by reason of the
cold, when he is afraid of small evils that are against him, and leaves
undone things of the greatest importance.  Further it is well said, *He
shall beg in summer, and it shall not be given unto him.*  For whoso
toils not now in good works will beg in summer and receive nothing,
because, when the burning sun of judgment shall appear, he will then sue
in vain for entrance into the kingdom.  To him it is well said again
through the same Solomon, *He that observeth the wind doth not sow:  and
he that regardeth the clouds never reapeth* ([Eccles. xi.
4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p3.6"></span>).  For what is expressed by the wind but
the temptation of malignant spirits?  And what are denoted by the clouds
which are moved of the wind but the oppositions of bad men?  The clouds,
that is to say, are driven by the winds, because bad men are excited by
the blasts of unclean spirits.  He, then, that observeth the wind soweth
not, and he that regardeth the clouds reapeth not, because whosoever
fears the temptation of malignant spirits, whosoever the persecution of
bad men, and does not sow the seed of good work now, neither doth he
then reap handfuls of holy recompense.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p4"></span>But on the other hand the hasty,
while they forestall the time of good deeds, pervert their merit, and
often fall into what is evil, while failing altogether to discern what
is good.  Such persons look not at all to see what things they are doing
when they do them, but for the most part, when they are done, become
aware that they ought not to have done them.  To such, under the guise
of a learner, it is well said in Solomon, *My son, do nothing without
counsel, and after it is done thou shalt not repent* ([Ecclesiasticus
32.24](../../../bib/apo/sir032.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p4.1"></span>).  And again, *Let thine eyelids go
before thy steps* ([Prov. iv. 25](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#025.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p4.2"></span>).  For indeed our eyelids go before our
steps, when right counsels prevent our doings.  For he who neglects to
look forward by consideration to what he is about to do advances his
steps with his eyes closed; proceeds on and accomplishes his journey,
but goes not in advance of himself by looking forward; and therefore the
sooner falls, because he gives no heed through the eyelid of counsel to
where he should set the foot of action.
