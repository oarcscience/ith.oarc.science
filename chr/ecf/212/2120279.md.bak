<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p2"></span>How to be admonished are those who
give away what is their own, and those who seize what belongs to others.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3"></span>(*Admonition* 21.)  Differently to be
admonished are those who already give compassionately of their own, and
those who still would fain seize even what belongs to others.  For those
who already give compassionately of their own are to be admonished not
to lift themselves up in swelling thought above those to whom they
impart earthly things; not to esteem themselves better than others
because they see others to be supported by them.  For the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.1"></span>Lord</span> of an
earthly household, in distributing the ranks and ministries of his
servants, appoints some to rule, but some to be ruled by others.  Those
he orders to supply to the rest what is necessary, these to take what
they receive from others.  And yet it is for the most part those that
rule who offend, <span id="page_45b">p. 45b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-Page_45b"></span>while those that are ruled remain in
favour with the good man of the house.  Those who are dispensers incur
wrath; those who subsist by the dispensation of others continue without
offence.  Those, then, who already give compassionately of the things
which they possess are to be admonished to acknowledge themselves to be
placed by the heavenly <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.2"></span>Lord</span> as dispensers of temporal
supplies, and to impart the same all the more humbly from their
understanding that the things which they dispense are not their own. 
And, when they consider that they are appointed for the service of those
to whom they impart what they have received, by no means let vain glory
elate their minds, but let fear depress them.  Whence also it is needful
for them to take anxious thought lest they distribute what has been
committed to them unworthily; lest they bestow something on those on
whom they ought to have spent nothing, or nothing on those on whom they
ought to have spent something, or much on those on whom they ought to
have spent little, or little on those on whom they ought to have spent
much; lest by precipitancy they scatter unprofitably what they give;
lest by tardiness they mischievously torment petitioners; lest the
thought of receiving a favour in return creep in; lest craving for
transitory praise extinguish the light of giving; lest accompanying
moroseness beset an offered gift; lest in case of a gift that has been
well offered the mind be exhilarated more than is fit; lest, when they
have fulfilled all aright, they give something to themselves, and so at
once lose all after they have accomplished all.  For, that they may not
attribute to themselves the virtue of their liberality, let them hear
what is written, *If any man administer, let him do it as of the ability
which <span class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.3"></span>God</span>
administereth* ([1 Pet. iv. 11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.4"></span>).  That they may not rejoice
immoderately in benefits bestowed, let them hear what is written, *When
ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are
unprofitable servants, we have done that which was our duty to do*
([Luke xvii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.5"></span>).  That moroseness may not spoil
liberality, let them hear what is written, *<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.6"></span>God</span> loveth a cheerful giver* ([2
Cor. ix. 7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.7"></span>).  That they may not seek transitory
praise for a gift bestowed, let them hear what is written, *Let not thy
left hand know what thy right hand doeth* ([Matth. vi.
3](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.8"></span>).  That is, let not the glory of the
present life mix itself with the largesses of piety, nor let desire of
favour know anything of the work of rectitude.  That they may not
require a return for benefits bestowed, let them hear what is written,
*When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy
brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours, lest they also
bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee. but, when thou makest a
feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:  and thou shalt
be blessed; for they have not whereof to recompense thee* ([Luke xiv.
12](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.9"></span> *seq.*).  That they may not supply too
late what should be supplied at once, let them hear what is written,
*Say not unto thy friend, go and come again, and to-morrow I will give,
when thou mightest give immediately* ([Prov. iii.
28](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#028.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.10"></span>).  Lest, under pretence of liberality,
they should scatter what they possess unprofitably, let them hear what
is written, *Let thine alms sweat in thine hand.*  Lest, when much is
necessary, little be given, let them hear what is written, *He that
soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly* ([2 Cor. ix.
6](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.11"></span>).  Lest, when they ought to give
little, they give too much, and afterwards, badly enduring want
themselves, break out into impatience, let them hear what is written,
*Not that other men be eased, and ye burdened, but by an equality, that
your abundance may supply their want, and that their abundance may be a
supply to your want* ([2 Cor. 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.12"></span>).  For, when the soul of the giver
knows not how to endure want, then, in withdrawing much from himself, he
seeks out against himself occasion of impatience.  For the mind should
first be prepared for patience, and then either much or all be bestowed
in bounty, lest, the inroad of want being borne with but little
equanimity, both the reward of previous bounty be lost, and subsequent
murmuring bring worse ruin on the soul.  Lest they should give nothing
at all to those on whom they ought to bestow something, let them hear
what is written, *Give to every man that asketh of thee* ([Luke vi.
30](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.13"></span>).  Lest they should give something,
however little to those on whom they ought to bestow nothing at all, let
them hear what is written, *Give to the good man, and receive not a
sinner:  do well to him that is lowly, and give not to the ungodly*
([Ecclesiasticus 12.4](../../../bib/apo/sir012.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.14"></span>).  And again, *Set out thy bread and
wine on the burial of the just, but eat and drink not thereof with
sinners* ([Tobit iv. 17](../../../bib/apo/tob004.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3.15"></span>).

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p4"></span>For he gives his bread and wine to
sinners who gives assistance to the wicked for that they are wicked. 
For which cause also some of the rich of this world nourish players with
profuse bounties, while the poor of Christ are tormented with hunger. 
He, however, who gives his bread to one that is indigent, though he be a
sinner, not because he is a sinner, but because he is a man, does not in
truth nourish a sinner, but a poor righteous man, because what he loves
in him is not his sin, but his nature.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p5"></span>Those who already distribute
compassionately <span id="page_46b">p. 46b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-Page_46b"></span>what they possess are to be
admonished also that they study to keep careful guard, lest, when they
redeem by alms the sins they have committed, they commit others which
will still require redemption; lest they suppose the righteousness of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p5.1"></span>God</span> to be
saleable, thinking that if they take care to give money for their sins,
they can sin with impunity.  For, *The soul is more than meat, and the
body than raiment* ([Matt. 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md), [Luke
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#023.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p5.2"></span>).  He, therefore, who bestows meat or
raiment on the poor, and yet is polluted by iniquity of soul or body,
has offered the lesser thing to righteousness, and the greater thing to
sin; for he has given his possessions to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p5.3"></span>God</span>, and himself to the devil.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p6"></span>But, on the other hand, those who
still would fain seize what belongs to others are to be admonished to
give anxious heed to what the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p6.1"></span>Lord</span> says when He comes to
judgment.  For He says, *I was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat:  I
was thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink:  I was a stranger, and ye took Me
not in:  naked, and ye clothed Me not; sick, and in prison, and ye
visited Me not* ([Matt. 25:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#042.md),
[43](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#043.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p6.2"></span>).  And these he previously addresses
saying, *Depart from Me, ye cursed, into eternal fire, which is prepared
for the devil and his angels* ([Matt.
25.41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p6.3"></span>).  Lo, they are in no wise told that
they have committed robberies or any other acts of violence, and yet
they are given over to the eternal fires of Gehenna.  Hence, then, it is
to be gathered with how great damnation those will be visited who seize
what is not their own, if those who have indiscreetly kept their own are
smitten with so great punishment.  Let them consider in what guilt the
seizing of goods must bind them, if not parting with them subjects to
such a penalty.  Let them consider what injustice inflicted must
deserve, if kindness not bestowed is worthy of so great a chastisement.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p7"></span>When they are intent on seizing what
is not their own, let them hear what is written, *Woe to him that
increaseth that which is not his!  How long doth he heap up against
himself thick clay* ([Hab. ii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p7.1"></span>)?  For, indeed, for a covetous man to
heap up against him thick clay is to pile up earthly gains into a load
of sin.  When they desire to enlarge greatly the spaces of their
habitation, let them hear what is written, *Woe unto you that join house
to house and lay field to field, even till there be no place left. 
What, will ye dwell alone in the midst of the earth* ([Isa.
1:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000.md), [Isa.
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p7.2"></span>)?  As if to say plainly, How far do ye
stretch yourselves, ye that cannot bear to have comrades in a common
world?  Those that are joined to you ye keep down, and ever find some
against whom ye may have power to stretch yourselves.  When they are
intent on increasing money, let them hear what is written, *The covetous
man is not filled with money; and he that loveth riches shall not reap
fruit thereof* ([Eccles. v. 9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p7.3"></span>).  For indeed he would reap fruit of
them, were he minded, not loving them, to disperse them well.  But whoso
in his affection for them retains them, shall surely leave them behind
him here without fruit.  When they burn to be filled at once with all
manner of wealth, let them hear what is written, *He that maketh haste
to be rich shall not be innocent* ([Prov. xxviii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p7.4"></span>):  for certainly he who goes about to
increase wealth is negligent in avoiding sin; and, being caught after
the manner of birds, while looking greedily at the bait of earthly
things, he is not aware in what a noose of sin he is being strangled. 
When they desire any gains of the present world, and are ignorant of the
losses they will suffer in the world to come, let them hear what is
written, *An inheritance to which haste is made in the beginning in the
last end shall lack blessing* ([Prov. xx.
21](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p7.5"></span>).  For indeed we derive our beginning
from this life, that we may come in the end to the lot of blessing. 
They, therefore, that make haste to an inheritance in the beginning cut
off from themselves the lot of blessing in the end; since, while they
crave to be increased in goods here through the iniquity of avarice,
they become disinherited there of their eternal patrimony.  When they
either solicit very much, or succeed in obtaining all that they have
solicited, let them hear what is written. *What is a man profited, if he
should gain the whole world, but lose his own soul* ([Matth. xvi.
26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p7.6"></span>)?  As if the Truth said plainly, What is
a man profited, though he gather together all that is outside himself,
if this very thing only which is himself he damns?  But for the most
part the covetousness of spoilers is the sooner corrected, if it be
shewn by the words of such as admonish them how fleeting is the present
life; if mention be made of those who have long endeavoured to grow rich
in this world, and yet have been unable to remain long among their
acquired riches; from whom hasty death has taken away suddenly and all
at once whatever, neither all at once nor suddenly, they have gathered
together; who have not only left here what they had seized, but have
carried with them to the judgment arraignments for seizure.  Let them,
therefore, be told of examples of such as these, whom they would,
doubtless, even themselves, in words condemn; so that, when after their
words they come back to their own heart, they may blush at any rate to
imitate those whom they judge.

others, but keep their own; and those who give of their own, yet seize
