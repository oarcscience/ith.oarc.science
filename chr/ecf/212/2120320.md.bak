<span id="iii.v.i.xviii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p2"></span>To John, Bishop of Constantinople,
and the Other Patriarchs.

<span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p3"></span>Gregory, to John of Constantinople,
Eulogius of Alexandria, Gregory of Antioch, John of Jerusalem, and
Anastasias, Ex-Patriarch of Antioch.  *A paribus* <span
id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md) .

<span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p5"></span>When I consider how, unworthy as I
am, and resisting with my whole soul, I have been compelled to bear the
burden of pastoral care, a darkness of sorrow comes over me, and my sad
heart sees nothing else but the shadows which allow nothing to be seen. 
For to what end is a bishop chosen of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xviii-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> but to be an intercessor for
the offences of the people?  With what confidence, then, can I come as
an intercessor for the sins of others to Him before Whom I am not secure
about my own?  If perchance any one should ask me to become his
intercessor with a great man who was incensed against him, and to myself
unknown, I should at once reply, I cannot go to intercede for you,
having no knowledge of that man from familiar acquaintance with him.  If
then, as man with man, I should properly blush to become an intercessor
with one on whom I had no claim, how great is the audacity of my
obtaining the place of intercessor for the people with <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p5.2"></span>God</span>, whose
friendship I am not assured of through the merit of my life!  And in
this matter I find a still more serious cause of alarm, since we all
know well that, when one who is in disfavour is sent to intercede with
an incensed person, the mind of the latter is provoked to still greater
severity.  And I am greatly afraid lest the community of believers,
whose offences the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xviii-p5.3"></span>Lord</span> has so far indulgently borne
with, should perish through the addition of my guilt to theirs.  But,
when in one way or another I suppress this fear, and with mind consoled
give myself to the care of my pontifical office, I am deterred by
consideration of the immensity of this very task.

<span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p6"></span>“For indeed I consider with myself
what watchful care is needed that a ruler may be pure in thought, chief
in action, discreet in keeping silence, profitable in speech, a near
neighbour to every one in sympathy, exalted above all in contemplation,
a companion of good livers through humility, unbending against the vices
of evil-doers through zeal for righteousness <span
id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md) .”  All which things when I try to
search out with subtle investigation, the very wideness of the
consideration cramps me in the particulars.  For, as I have already
said, there is need of the greatest care that “the ruler be pure in
thought, &c.”  \[A long passage, thus beginning, and ending with <span
id="page_81b">p. 81b</span> <span
id="iii.v.i.xviii-Page_81b"></span>“beyond the limit of order,” is found
also in *Regula Pastoralis*, Pt. II. ch. 2, which see.\]

<span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p8"></span>Again, when I betake myself to
consider the works required of the pastor, I weigh within myself what
intent care is to be taken that he be “chief in action, to the end that
by his living, he may point out the way of life to them that are put
under him, &c.”  \[See *Reg. Past.*, Pt. II. ch. 3, to the end.\]

<span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p9"></span>Again, when I betake myself to
consider the duty of the pastor as to speech and silence, I weigh within
myself with trembling care how very necessary it is that he should be
discreet in keeping silence and profitable in speech, “lest he either
utter what ought to be suppressed or suppress what ought to be uttered,
&c.”  \[See *Reg. Past.*, III., 4, down to “keep the unity of the
faith.”\]

<span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p10"></span>Again, when I betake myself to
consider what manner of man the ruler ought to be in sympathy, and what
in contemplation, I weigh within myself that he “should be a near
neighbour to every one in sympathy, and exalted above all in
contemplation, to the end that through the bowels of loving-kindness,
&c.”  \[See *Reg. Past*, Pt. II. ch. 5, to the end.\]

<span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p11"></span>Again, when I betake myself to
consider what manner of man the ruler ought to be in humility, and what
in strictness, I weigh within myself how necessary it is that he “should
be, through humility, a companion to good livers, and, through the zeal
of righteousness rigid against the vices of evil-doers &c.”  \[See
*Regula Pastoralis*, Pt. II. ch. 6, down to “towards the perverse;”
there being only a slight variation, not affecting the sense, in the
wording of the concluding clause.\]  For hence it is that “Peter who had
received from <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xviii-p11.1"></span>God</span>, &c.”  \[See *Reg. Past.*,
Pt. II. ch. 6, down to “dominates over vices rather than over his
brethren.”\]  He orders well the authority he has received who has
learnt both to maintain it and to keep it in check.  He orders it well
who knows how both through it to tower above sins, and with it to set
himself on an equality with other men.

<span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p12"></span>Moreover, the virtue of humility
ought to be so maintained that the rights of government be not relaxed;
lest, when any prelate has lowered himself more than is becoming, he be
unable to restrain the life of his subordinates under the bond of
discipline; and the severity of discipline is to be so maintained that
gentleness be not wholly lost through the over-kindling of zeal.  For
often vices shew themselves off as virtues, so that niggardliness would
fain appear as frugality, extravagance as liberality, cruelty as
righteous zeal, laxity as loving-kindness.  Wherefore both discipline
and mercy are far from what they should be, if one be maintained without
the other.  But there ought to be kept up with great skill of
discernment both mercy justly considerate, and discipline smiting
kindly.  “For hence it is that, as the Truth teaches ([Luke x.
34](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#034.md)<span
id="iii.v.i.xviii-p12.1"></span>), the man is brought by the care of the
Samaritan, &c.”  \[See *Reg. Past.*, Pt. II. ch. 6, down to “manna of
sweetness.”\]

<span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p13"></span>Thus, having undertaken the burden
of pastoral care, when I consider all these things and many others of
like kind, I seem to be what I cannot be, especially as in this place
whosoever is called a Pastor is onerously occupied by external cares; so
that it often becomes uncertain whether he exercises the function of a
pastor or of an earthly noble.  And indeed whosoever is set over his
brethren to rule them cannot be entirely free from external cares; and
yet there is need of exceeding care lest he be pressed down by them too
much.  “Whence it is rightly said to Ezekiel, The priests shall not
shave their heads, &c.”  \[See *Reg. Past.*, Pt. II., ch. 7, to the
end.\]

<span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p14"></span>But in this place I see that no such
discreet management is possible, since cases of such importance hang
over me daily as to overwhelm the mind, while they kill the bodily
life.  Wherefore, most holy brother, I beseech thee by the Judge who is
to come, by the assembly of many thousand angels, by the Church of the
firstborn who are written in heaven, help me, who am growing weary under
this burden of pastoral care, with the intercession of thy prayer, lest
its weight oppress me beyond my strength.  But, being mindful of what is
written, *Pray for one another, that ye may be healed* ([James v.
16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.v.i.xviii-p14.1"></span>), I give also what I ask for.  But I
shall receive what I give.  For, while we are joined to you through the
aid of prayer, we hold as it were each other by the hand while walking
through slippery places, and it comes to pass, through a great provision
of charity, that the foot of each is the more firmly planted in that one
leans upon the other.

<span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p15"></span>Besides, since with the heart man
believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto
salvation, I confess that I receive and revere, as the four books of the
Gospel so also the four Councils:  to wit, the Nicene, in which the
perverse doctrine of Arius is overthrown; the Constantinopolitan also,
in which the error of Eunomius and Macedonius is refuted; further, the
first Ephesine, in which the impiety of Nestorius is condemned; and the
Chalcedonian, in which the pravity of Eutyches and Dioscorus <span
id="page_82b">p. 82b</span> <span id="iii.v.i.xviii-Page_82b"></span>is
reprobated.  These with full devotion I embrace, and adhere to with most
entire approval; since on them, as on a four-square stone, rises the
structure of the holy faith; and whosoever, of whatever life and
behaviour he may be, holds not fast to their solidity, even though he is
seen to be a stone, yet he lies outside the building.  The fifth council
also I equally venerate, in which the epistle which is called that of
Ibas, full of error, is reprobated; Theodorus, who divides the Mediator
between <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xviii-p15.1"></span>God</span> and men into two
subsistences, is convicted of having fallen into the perfidy of impiety;
and the writings of Theodoritus, in which the faith of the blessed Cyril
is impugned, are refuted as having been published with the daring of
madness.  But all persons whom the aforesaid venerable Councils
repudiate I repudiate; those whom they venerate I embrace; since, they
having been constituted by universal consent, he overthrows not them but
himself, whosoever presumes either to loose those whom they bind, or to
bind those whom they loose.  Whosoever, therefore, thinks otherwise, let
him be anathema.  But whosoever holds the faith of the aforesaid synods,
peace be to him from <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xviii-p15.2"></span>God</span> the Father, through Jesus
Christ His Son, Who lives and reigns consubstantially <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xviii-p15.3"></span>God</span> with Him in
the Unity of the Holy Spirit for ever and ever.  Amen.

is a copy of an identical one that has been sent to more than one
person, *exemplis* being perhaps understood.  Cf. I. 80; VI. 52, 54, 58;
