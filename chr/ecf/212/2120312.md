<span id="iii.v.i.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.x-p1.1"></span>Epistle XI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.x-p2"></span>*To Clementina, Patrician* <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313.md) .

<span id="iii.v.i.x-p4"></span>Gregory to Clementina, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.x-p5"></span>Having received your Glory’s letter
speaking of the passing away of the late Eutherius of magnificent
memory, we give you to understand that our mind no less than yours is
disturbed by such a sorrow, in that we see how men of approved repute
are by degrees removed from this world, whose ruin is already evidenced
in the actual effects of the causes thereof.  But it becomes us to
withdraw ourselves from it by the wise precaution of conversion <span
id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md) , lest it involve us too in its own
ruin.  And indeed our sorrow for the loss of friends ought to be the
more tolerable as our condition of mortality requires from us that we
should lose them.  Nevertheless, for the loss of aid to our carnal life
He Who granted permission for its removal is powerful to console, and to
come Himself as a comforter into the vacant place.

<span id="iii.v.i.x-p7"></span>That we are unable to accede to your
request that the deacon Anatholius should be sent to you is due to the
circumstances of the case, and not to any rigorous austerity.  For we
have appointed him our steward <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md) , having committed our episcopal
residence to his management.
