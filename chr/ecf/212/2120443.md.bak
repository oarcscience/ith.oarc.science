<span id="iii.v.iv.xxii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxii-p2"></span>To Constantina Augusta.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxii-p3"></span>Gregory to Constantina, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxii-p4"></span>The Serenity of your Piety,
conspicuous for religious zeal and love of holiness, has charged me with
your commands to send to you the head of Saint Paul, or some other part
of his body, for the church which is being built in honour of the same
Saint Paul in the palace.  And, being desirous of receiving commands
from you, by exhibiting the most ready obedience to which I might the
more provoke your favour towards me, I am all the more distressed that I
neither can nor dare do what you enjoin.  For the bodies of the apostles
<span id="page_155b">p. 155b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iv.xxii-Page_155b"></span>Saint Peter and Saint Paul glitter
with so great miracles and terrors in their churches that one cannot
even go to pray there without great fear.  In short, when my
predecessor, of blessed memory, was desirous of changing the silver
which was over the most sacred body of the blessed apostle Peter, though
at a distance of almost fifteen feet from the same body, a sign of no
small dreadfulness appeared to him.  Nay, I too wished in like manner to
amend something not far from the most sacred body of Saint Paul the
apostle; and, it being necessary to dig to some depth near his
sepulchre, the superintendent of that place found some bones, which were
not indeed connected with the same sepulchre; but, inasmuch as he
presumed to lift them and transfer them to another place, certain awful
signs appeared, and he died suddenly.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxii-p5"></span>Besides all this, when my
predecessor, of holy memory, was desiring in like manner to make some
improvements not far from the body of Saint Laurence the martyr, it not
being known where the venerable body was laid, diggings were made in the
course of search, and suddenly his sepulchre was unawares disclosed; and
those who were present and working, monks and *mansionarii* <span
id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552.md) , who saw the body of the same
martyr, which they did not indeed presume to touch, all died within ten
days, so that none might survive who had seen the holy body of that
righteous man.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxii-p7"></span>Moreover, let my most tranquil lady
know that it is not the custom of the Romans, when they give relics of
saints, to presume to touch any part of the body; but only a cloth
(*brandeum*) is put into a box (*pyxide*), and placed near the most
sacred bodies of the saints:  and when it is taken up it is deposited
with due reverence in the Church that is to be dedicated, and such
powerful effects are thereby produced there as might have been if their
bodies had been brought to that special place.  Whence it came to pass
in the times of Pope Leo, of blessed memory, as has been handed down
from our forefathers, that, certain Greeks being in doubt about such
relics, the aforesaid pontiff took scissors and cut this same cloth
(*brandeum*), and from the very incision blood flowed.  For in the Roman
and all the Western parts it is unendurable and sacrilegious for any one
by any chance to desire to touch the bodies of saints:  and, if one
should presume to do this, it is certain that this temerity will by no
means remain unpunished.  For this reason we greatly wonder at the
custom of the Greeks, who say that they take up the bones of saints; and
we scarcely believe it.  For certain Greek monks who came here more than
two years ago dug up in the silence of night near the church of Saint
Paul, bodies of dead men lying in the open field, and laid up their
bones to be kept in their own possession till their departure.  And,
when they were taken and diligently examined as to why they did this,
they confessed that they were going to carry those bones to Greece to
pass for relics of saints.  From this instance, as has been already
said, the greater doubt has been engendered in us whether it be true
that they really take up the bones of saints, as they are said to do.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxii-p8"></span>But what shall I say of the bodies of
the blessed apostles, when it is well known that, at the time when they
suffered, believers came from the East to recover their bodies as being
those of their own countrymen?  And, having been taken as far as the
second milestone from the city, they were deposited in the place which
is called Catacumbas.  But, when the whole multitude came together and
endeavoured to remove them thence, such violence of thunder and
lightning terrified and dispersed them that they on no account presumed
to attempt such a thing again.  And then the Romans, who of the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xxii-p8.1"></span>Lord’s</span>
loving-kindness were counted worthy to do this, went out and took up
their bodies, and laid them in the places where they are now deposited.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxii-p9"></span>Who then, most serene lady, can there
be so venturesome as, knowing these things, to presume, I do not say to
touch their bodies, but even at all to look at them?  Such orders
therefore having been given me by you, which I could by no means have
obeyed, it has not, so far as I find, been of your own motion; but
certain men have wished to stir up your Piety against me, so as to
withdraw from me (which <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxii-p9.1"></span>God</span> forbid) the favour of your
good will, and have therefore sought out a point in which I might be
found as if disobedient to you.  But I trust in Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xxii-p9.2"></span>God</span> that your
most kind good will is in no way being stolen away from me, and that you
will always have with you the power of the holy apostles, whom with all
your heart and mind you love, not from their bodily presence, but from
their protection.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxii-p10"></span>Moreover, the napkin, which you have
likewise ordered to be sent you, is with his body, and so cannot be
touched, as his body cannot be approached.  But since so religious a
desire of my most serene lady ought not to be wholly unsatisfied, I will
make haste to transmit to you some portion of the chains which Saint
<span id="page_156b">p. 156b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iv.xxii-Page_156b"></span>Peter the apostle himself bore on
his neck and his hands, from which many miracles are displayed among the
people; if at least I should succeed in removing it by filing.  For,
while many come frequently to seek a blessing from these same chains, in
the hope of receiving a little part of the filings, a priest attends
with a file, and in the case of some seekers a portion comes off so
quickly from these chains that there is no delay:  but in the case of
other seekers the file is drawn for long over the chains, and yet
nothing can be got from them.  In the month of June, Indiction 12.
