<span id="iii.iv.ii.i-p8"></span>Gregory to his most reverend and most
holy brother and fellow-bishop, John.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.i-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.i-p9.1"></span>With</span> kind and humble intent thou
reprovest me, dearest brother, for having wished by hiding myself to fly
from the burdens of pastoral care; as to which, lest to some they should
appear light, I express with my pen in the book before you all my own
estimate of their heaviness, in order both that he who is free from them
may not unwarily seek them, and that he who has so sought them may
tremble for having got them.  This book is divided into four separate
heads of argument, that it may approach the reader’s mind by allegations
arranged in order—by certain steps, as it were.  For, as the necessity
of things requires, we must especially consider after what manner every
one should come to supreme rule; and, duly arriving at it, after what
manner he should live; and, living well, after what manner he should
teach; and, teaching aright, with how great consideration every day he
should become aware of his own infirmity; lest either humility fly from
the approach, or life be at variance with the arrival, or teaching be
wanting to the life, or presumption unduly exalt the teaching. 
Wherefore, let fear temper the desire; but afterwards, authority being
assumed by one who sought it not, let his life commend it.  But then it
is necessary that the good which is displayed in the life of the pastor
should also be propagated by his speech.  And at last it remains that,
whatever works are brought to perfection, consideration of our own
infirmity should depress us with regard to them, lest the swelling of
elation extinguish even them before the eyes of hidden judgment.  But
inasmuch as there are many, like me in unskilfulness, who, while they
know not how to measure themselves, are covetous of teaching what they
have not learned; who estimate lightly the burden of authority in
proportion as they are ignorant of the pressure of its greatness; let
them be reproved from the very beginning of this book; so that, while,
unlearned and precipitate, they desire to hold the citadel of teaching,
they may be repelled at the very door of our discourse from the ventures
of their precipitancy.
