<span id="iii.v.vi.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>Epistle VII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.vi-p2"></span>To Candidus, Presbyter.

<span id="iii.v.vi.vi-p3"></span>Gregory to Candidus, Presbyter, going
to the patrimony of Gaul.

<span id="iii.v.vi.vi-p4"></span>Now that thou art proceeding, with the
help of our <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.vi-p4.1"></span>Lord</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.vi-p4.2"></span>God</span> Jesus Christ, to the government
of the patrimony that is in Gaul, we desire thy Love to procure with the
money thou mayest receive clothing for the poor, or English boys of
about seventeen or eighteen years of age, who may profit by being given
to <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.vi-p4.3"></span>God</span> in
monasteries, that so the money of Gaul, which cannot be spent in our
country <span id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) , may be expended
profitably in its own locality.  Further, if you should succeed in
getting anything from the moneys accruing to revenue which are called
*ablatæ* <span id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md) , from this too we
desire thee to procure clothing for the poor, or, as we have before
said, boys who may profit in the service of Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.vi-p6.2"></span>God</span>.  But, since
such as can be found there are pagans, I desire that a presbyter be sent
hither with them to provide against the case of any sickness occurring
on the way, that he may baptize those whom he sees to be about to die. 
Wherefore let your Love so proceed as to lose no time in accomplishing
these things diligently.

<span id="iii.v.vi.vi-p5"></span> Probably because of the inferior value
in Italy of Gallic gold.  “Nullus solidum integri ponderis calumniosæ
approbationis obtentu recuset exactor, excepto eo Gallico cujus aurum
minore æstimatione taxatur.”  *Novella Majoriani*.

<span id="iii.v.vi.vi-p6"></span> Some kind of due, so-called.  See Du
Cange under <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.vi-p6.1"></span>Ablata</span>:—“Ablatio, Exactio,
Tolta…‘Liberos deinceps esse constituimus ab omni tallia, ablatione et
exactione, et questu.’  (A. 1173).’
