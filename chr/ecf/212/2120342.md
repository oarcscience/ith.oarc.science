id="iii.v.i.xl-p1.1"></span>Epistle LVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xl-p2"></span>*To Arsicinus Duke, the Clergy,
Nobility, and Common People (ordini et plebi) of the City of Ariminum.*

<span id="iii.v.i.xl-p3"></span>Gregory to Arsicinus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xl-p4"></span>How ready is the devotion of your love
in expectation of a pontiff the text of the report which you have
addressed to us shews.  But, since the ordainer ought in such cases to
be exceedingly careful, we are watching over this case with due
deliberation.  And so we warn your Charity by this present writing that
no <span id="page_96b">p. 96b</span> <span
id="iii.v.i.xl-Page_96b"></span>one need trouble himself to apply to us
in favour of Ocleatinus:  but, if any one is found in your own city to
undertake this work with profit, so that he cannot be objected to by us,
let your choice concur in his favour.  But, if no one should be found
fit for it, we have mentioned to the bearers of these presents one to
whom you may no less accord your consent.  But do you with one accord
pray faithfully, that, whosoever may be ordained, he may be able both to
be profitable to you and to display priestly service worthy of our <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xl-p4.1"></span>God</span>.
