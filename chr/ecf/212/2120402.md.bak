id="iii.v.iii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.xvi-p2"></span>To Honoratus, Archdeacon.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xvi-p3"></span>Gregory to Honoratus, Archdeacon of
Salona <span id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) .

<span id="iii.v.iii.xvi-p5"></span>The mandates of ourselves and of our
predecessor had reached thy Love not long ago, in which thou wert
acquitted of the charges calumniously brought against thee; and we
ordered thee to be reinstated without any dispute in the order of thy
rank.  But, inasmuch as again after no great lapse of time, thou camest
to the city of Rome complaining of some improper proceedings among you
concerning the alienation of sacred vessels, and as, while we had
persons with us here who might have replied to thy objections, Natalis,
thy bishop, departed this life, we have judged it necessary to confirm
further by this present letter those same mandates, both our
predecessor’s and our own, which (as has been said) we sent not long ago
for thy acquittal.  Wherefore, acquitting thee fully of all the charges
brought against thee, we will that thou continue without any dispute in
the rank of thy order, so that the question raised by the aforesaid man
may not on any pretext prejudice thee in the least degree.  Moreover, as
to the heads of thy complaint, we have straitly charged Antoninus,
subdeacon and rector in your parts of the patrimony of holy Church over
which, by <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xvi-p5.1"></span>God’s</span> providence, we preside,
that, if he should find ecclesiastical persons implicated in them, he
decide these cases with the utmost strictness and authority.  But, in
case of the business being with such persons as the vigour of
ecclesiastical jurisdiction cannot reach, he is to deposit the proofs
under each particular head among the public acts, and transmit them to
us without any delay, that, being accurately informed, we may know how,
with the help of Christ, to dispose of the matter.
