id="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LVII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p2"></span>*To Arigius, Patrician* <span
id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670) .

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p4"></span>Gregory to Arigius, Patrician of
Gaul.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p5"></span>We have learnt from the servant of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p5.1"></span>God</span>,
Augustine, the bearer of these presents, how great goodness, how great
gentleness, with the charity that is well-pleasing to Christ, is in you
resplendent; and we give thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p5.2"></span>God</span>, who has granted you these
gifts of His loving-kindness, through which you may have it in your
power to be highly esteemed among men, and—what is truly
profitable—glorious in His sight.  We therefore pray Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p5.3"></span>God</span>, that He
would multiply in you these gifts which He has granted, and keep you
with all yours under His protection, and so dispose the doings of your
Glory in this world that they may be to your benefit both here, and—what
is more to be wished—in the life to come.  Saluting, then, your Glory
with paternal sweetness, we beg of you that the bearer of these
presents, and the servants of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p5.4"></span>God</span> who are with him, may
obtain your succour in what is needful, to the end that, while they
experience your favour, they may the better fulfil what has been
enjoined on them to do.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p6"></span>Furthermore, we commend to you in
all respects our son the presbyter Candidus, whom we have sent for the
government of the patrimony of our Church which is in your parts;
trusting that your Glory will receive a reward in return from our <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p6.1"></span>God</span>, if with
devout mind you lend your succour to the concerns of the poor.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p3"></span> The term *Patricius* was used to
designate governors of provinces under the Frank kings.  Cf. III. 33,
“Dynamio patricio Galliarum,” and *Greg. Turon*. (IV. 24), "Guntramnus
rex, amoto Agricola patricio, Celsum patriciatus honore donavit.  There
were at this time two Burgundian *Patricii*, one called the *Patricius*
absolutely, residing at Arles, the other at Marseilles (*Greg. Turon*).
