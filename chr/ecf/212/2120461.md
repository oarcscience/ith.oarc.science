<span id="iii.v.v.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XVII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.vii-p2"></span>*To Cyprian, Deacon* <span
id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582.md) .

<span id="iii.v.v.vii-p4"></span>Gregory to Cyprian, &c.

<span id="iii.v.v.vii-p5"></span>I received your letters of most bitter
import about the death of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.vii-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> Maximianus <span
id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583.md) in the month of November.  And he
indeed has reached the rewards he longed for, but the unhappy people of
the city of Syracuse is to be commiserated as not having been counted
worthy to have such a pastor long.  Accordingly let thy Love take
anxious heed that such a one may be chosen for ordination in the same
church as may not seem to obtain undeservedly the same place of rule
after the lord Maximianus.  And indeed I believe that the majority would
choose the presbyter Trajan, who, as is said, is of a good disposition,
but, as I suspect, not fit for ruling in that place.  Yet, if a better
cannot be found, and if there are no charges against him, he may be
condescended to under stress of very great necessity.  But, if my wishes
are asked with regard to this election, I inform thee privately of what
I do wish:  for no one in this same church appears to me so worthy after
the lord Maximianus as John the archdeacon of the church of Catana. 
And, if his election can be brought about, I believe that he will be
found an exceedingly fit person.  But he too must first be enquired
about by thee privately as to any charges against him that may stand in
the way.  If he should be found free from any, he may be rightly
chosen.  Should this be done, our brother and fellow-bishop Leo <span
id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584.md) will also have to give him leave to
go, that he may be found <span id="page_166b">p. 166b</span> <span
id="iii.v.v.vii-Page_166b"></span>free to be ordained.  These things,
then, I have taken care to intimate to thy Love; and it will now be thy
concern to look round thee on all sides carefully, and arrange what is
pleasing to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.vii-p7.1"></span>God</span>.
