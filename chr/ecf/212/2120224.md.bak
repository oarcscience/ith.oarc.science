<span id="ii.v.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Sermon XC.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xlvi-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xlvi-p2.1"></span>(On the Fast of Seventh Month, V.)</span>

<span id="ii.v.xlvi-p3"></span>I.  *We must always be seeking pardon,
because we are always liable to sin.*

<span id="ii.v.xlvi-p4"></span>We proclaim the holy Fast of the Seventh
Month, dearly-beloved, for the exercise of <span id="page_200">p.
200</span> <span id="ii.v.xlvi-Page_200"></span>common devotions,
confidently inciting you with fatherly exhortations to make Christian by
your observance that which was formerly Jewish <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197.md) .  For it is at all times suitable
and in agreement with both the New and Old Testament, that the Divine
Mercy should be sought with chastisement both of mind and body, because
nothing is more effectual in prevailing with <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlvi-p5.2"></span>God</span> than that a man should judge
himself and never cease from asking pardon, knowing that he is never
without fault.  For human nature has this flaw in itself, not planted
there by the Creator but contracted by the transgressor <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198.md) , and transmitted to his posterity
by the law of generation <span id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199.md) , so
that from the corruptible body springs that which may corrupt the soul
also.  Hence although the inner man be now reborn in Christ and rescued
from the bonds of captivity, it has unceasing conflicts with the flesh,
and has to endure resistance in seeking to restrain vain desires.  And
in this strife such perfect victory is not easily obtained that even
those habits which must be broken off do not still encumber us, and
those vices which must be slain do not wound.  However wisely and
prudently the mind presides as judge over the outer senses, yet even
amid the pains it takes to rule and the limits it imposes on the
appetites of the flesh, the temptation is always too close at hand.  For
who so abstracts himself from pleasure or pain of body that his mind is
not affected by that which delights or racks it from without?  Joy and
sorrow are inseparable from a man:  no part of him is free from the
kindlings of wrath, the over-powerings of delight, the castings down of
affliction.  And what turning away from sin can there be, where ruler
and ruled alike are liable to the same passions?  Rightly does the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvi-p7.1"></span>Lord</span> exclaim that
“the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200.md) .”

<span id="ii.v.xlvi-p9"></span>II.  *Christ is Himself the Way, which He
bids us tread.*

<span id="ii.v.xlvi-p10"></span>And lest we should be led by despair
into sheer inaction, He promises that the Divine power shall make those
things possible which are to man impossible from his own lack of power: 
“for narrow and strait is the way which leadeth unto life <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201.md) ,” and no one could set foot on it,
no one could advance one step, unless Christ by making Himself the Way
unbarred the difficulties of approach:  and thus the Ordainer of the
journey becomes the Means whereby we are able to accomplish it, because
not only does He impose the labour, but also brings us to the haven of
rest.  In Him therefore we find our Model of patience, in Whom we have
our Hope of life eternal; for “if we suffer with Him, we shall also
reign with Him <span id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202.md) ,” since, as
the Apostle says, “he that saith he abideth in Christ ought himself also
to walk as He walked <span id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203.md) .” 
Otherwise we make a vain presence and show, if we follow not His steps,
Whose name we glory in, and assuredly they would not be irksome to us,
but would free us from all dangers, if we loved nothing but what He
commanded us to love.

<span id="ii.v.xlvi-p14"></span>III.  *The love of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvi-p14.1"></span>God</span> contrasted with
the love of the world.*

<span id="ii.v.xlvi-p15"></span>For there are two loves from which
proceed all wishes, as different in quality as they are different in
their sources.  For the reasonable soul, which cannot exist without
love, is the lover either of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlvi-p15.1"></span>God</span> or the world.  In the love of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvi-p15.2"></span>God</span> there is
no excess, but in the love of the world all is hurtful.  And therefore
we must cling inseparably to eternal treasures, but things temporal we
must use like passers-by, that as we are sojourners hastening to return
to our own land, all the good things of this world which meet us may be
as aids on the way, not snares to detain us.  Therefore the blessed
Apostle makes this proclamation, “the time is short:  it remains that
those who have wives be as though they had none; and those who weep, as
though they wept not; and those who rejoice, as though they rejoiced
not; and those who buy, as though they possessed not; and those that use
this world, as though they used it not.  For the fashion of this world
passes away <span id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204.md) .”  But as the
world attracts us with its appearance, and abundance and variety, it is
not easy to turn away from it unless in the beauty of things visible the
Creator rather than the creature is loved; for, when He says, “thou
shalt love the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlvi-p16.2"></span>Lord</span> thy <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlvi-p16.3"></span>God</span> from all thy heart, and from all
thy mind, and from all thy strength <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205.md) ,” He wishes us in noticing to
loosen ourselves from the bonds of His love.  And when He links the love
of our neighbour also to this command, He enjoins on us the imitation of
His own goodness, that we should love what He loves and do what He
does.  For although we be “<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlvi-p17.2"></span>God’s</span> husbandry and <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvi-p17.3"></span>God’s</span> building,” and
“neither is he that planteth anything, nor he that watereth, but <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvi-p17.4"></span>God</span> that giveth the
increase <span id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206.md) ,” yet in all things
He requires our <span id="page_201">p. 201</span> <span
id="ii.v.xlvi-Page_201"></span>ministry and service, and wishes us to be
the stewards of His gifts, that he who bears <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlvi-p18.2"></span>God’s</span> image may do <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvi-p18.3"></span>God’s</span> will.  For
this reason, in the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlvi-p18.4"></span>Lord’s</span> prayer we say most devoutly,
“Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done as in heaven, so also on earth.” 
For what else do we ask for in these words but that <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xlvi-p18.5"></span>God</span> may subdue those
whom He has not yet subdued, and as in heaven He makes the angels
ministers of His will, so also on earth He may make men?  And in seeking
this we love <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlvi-p18.6"></span>God</span>, we love also our neighbour:  and
the love within us has but one Object, since we desire the bond-servant
to serve and the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlvi-p18.7"></span>Lord</span> to have rule.

<span id="ii.v.xlvi-p19"></span>IV.  *The love of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlvi-p19.1"></span>God</span> is fostered by good works.*

<span id="ii.v.xlvi-p20"></span>This state of mind, therefore, beloved,
from which earthly love is excluded, is strengthened by the habit of
well-doing, because the conscience must needs be delighted at good
deeds, and do willingly what it rejoices to have done.  Thus it is that
fasts are kept, alms freely given, justice maintained, frequent prayer
resorted to, and the desires of individuals become the common wish of
all.  Labour fosters patience, gentleness extinguishes anger,
loving-kindness treads down hatred, unclean desires are slain by holy
aspirations, avarice is cast out by liberality, and burdensome wealth
becomes the means of virtuous acts <span
id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207.md) .  But because the snares of the
devil are not at rest even in such a state of things, most rightly at
certain seasons of the year the renewal of our vigour is provided for: 
and now in particular, when one who is greedy of present good might
boast himself over the clemency of the weather and the fertility of the
land, and having stored his crops in great barns, might say to his soul,
“thou hast much goods, eat and drink,” let him take heed to the rebuke
of the Divine voice, and hear it saying, “Thou fool, this night they
require thy soul of thee, and the things which thou hast prepared, whose
shall they be <span id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208.md) ?”  This should
be the wise man’s most anxious consideration, in order that, as the days
of this life are short and its span uncertain, death may never come upon
him unawares, and that knowing himself mortal he may meet his end fully
prepared.  And so, that this may avail both for the sanctification of
our bodies and the renewal of our souls, on Wednesday and Friday let us
fast, and on Saturday let us keep vigil with the most blessed Apostle
Peter, whose prayers will help us to obtain fulfilment of our holy
desires through Christ our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xlvi-p22.2"></span>Lord</span>, Who with the Father and the
Holy Ghost lives and reigns for ever and ever.  Amen.
