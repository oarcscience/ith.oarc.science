<span id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p2"></span>To King Childebert.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p3"></span>Gregory to Childebert, king of the
Franks <span id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md) .

<span id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p5"></span>The letter of your Excellency has
made us exceedingly glad, testifying as it does that you are careful,
with pious affection, of the honour and reverence due to priests.  For
you thus shew to all that you are faithful worshippers of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p5.1"></span>God</span>, while you
love His priests with the acceptable veneration that is due to them, and
hasten with Christian devotion to do whatever may advance their
position.  Whence also we have received with pleasure what you have
written, and grant what you desire with willing mind; and accordingly we
have committed, with the favour of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p5.2"></span>God</span>, our vicariate jurisdiction
to our brother Virgilius, bishop of the city of Arelate, according to
ancient custom and your Excellency’s desire; and have also granted him
the use of the pallium, as has been the custom of old.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p6"></span>But, inasmuch as some things have
been reported to us which greatly offend Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p6.1"></span>God</span>, and confound the honour and
reverence due to the priesthood, we beg that they may be in every way
amended with the support of the censure of your power, lest, while
headstrong and perverse doings run counter to your devotion, your
kingdom, or your soul (which <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p6.2"></span>God</span> forbid) be burdened by the
guilt of others.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p7"></span>Further, it has come to our
knowledge that on the death of bishops some persons from being laymen
are tonsured, and mount to the episcopate by a sudden leap.  And thus
one <span id="page_185b">p. 185b</span> <span
id="iii.v.v.xxviii-Page_185b"></span>who has not been a disciple is in
his inconsiderate ambition made a master.  And, since he has not learned
what to teach, he bears the office of priesthood only in name; for he
continues to be a layman in speech and action as before.  How, then, is
he to intercede for the sins of others, not having in the first place
bewailed his own?  For such a shepherd does not defend, but deceives,
the flock; since, while he cannot for very shame try to persuade others
to do what he does not do himself, what else is it but that the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p7.1"></span>Lord’s</span> people
remains a prey to robbers, and catches destruction from the source
whence it ought to have had a great support of wholesome protection? 
How bad and how perverse a proceeding this is let your Excellency’s
Highness consider even from your own administration of things.  For it
is certain that you do not put a leader over an army unless his work and
his fidelity have first been apparent; unless the virtue and industry of
his previous life have shewn him to be a fit person.  But, if the
command of an army is not committed to any but men of this kind, it is
easily gathered from this comparison of what sort a leader of souls
ought to be.  But it is a reproach to us, and we are ashamed to say it,
that priests snatch at leadership who have not seen the very beginning
of religious warfare.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p8"></span>But this also, a thing most
execrable, has been reported to us as well:  that sacred orders are
conferred through simoniacal heresy, that is for bribes received.  And,
seeing that it is exceedingly pestiferous, and contrary to the Universal
Church, that one be promoted to any sacred order not for merit but for a
price, we exhort your Excellency to order so detestable a wickedness to
be banished from your kingdom.  For that man shows himself to be
thoroughly unworthy of this office, who fears not to buy the gift of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p8.1"></span>God</span> with
money, and presumes to try to get by payment what he deserves not to
have through grace.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p9"></span>These things, then, most excellent
son, I admonish you about for this reason, that I desire your soul to be
saved.  And I should have written about them before now, had not
innumerable occupations stood in the way of my will.  But now that a
suitable time for answering your letter has offered itself, I have not
omitted what it was my duty to do.  Wherefore, greeting your Excellency
with the affection of paternal charity, we beg that all things which we
have enjoined on our above-named brother and fellow-bishop to be done
and observed, may be carried out under the protection of your favour,
and that you allow them not to be in any way upset by the elation or
pride of any one.  But, as they were observed by his predecessor under
the reign of your glorious father, so let them be observed now also, by
your aid, with zealous devotion.  It is right, then, that we should thus
have a return made to us; and that, as we have not deferred fulfilling
your will, so you too, for the sake of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p9.1"></span>God</span> and the blessed Peter, Prince
of the apostles, should cause our ordinances to be observed in all
respects; that so your Excellency’s reputation, praiseworthy and
well-pleasing to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxviii-p9.2"></span>God</span>, may extend itself all
around.  Given the 12th day of August, Indiction 13.
