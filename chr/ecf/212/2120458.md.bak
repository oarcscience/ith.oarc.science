<span id="iii.v.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Epistle VIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.iv-p2"></span>To Cyprian, Deacon.

<span id="iii.v.v.iv-p3"></span>Gregory to Cyprian, deacon and rector of
the patrimony of Sicily.

<span id="iii.v.v.iv-p4"></span>Concerning the Manicheans who are on our
possessions I have frequently admonished thy Love to press them with the
utmost diligence, and recall them to the Catholic faith.  If, then, the
time requires it, make enquiries in person, or, if other business does
not allow this, through others.  Further, it has come to my ears that
there are Hebrews on our possessions <span id="page_164b">p. 164b</span>
<span id="iii.v.v.iv-Page_164b"></span>who will not by any means be
converted to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.iv-p4.1"></span>God</span>.  But it seems to me that thou
shouldest send letters through all our possessions on which these
Hebrews are known to be, promising them particularly from me that
whosoever of them shall have been converted to our true <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.iv-p4.2"></span>Lord</span> <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.iv-p4.3"></span>God</span> Jesus Christ
shall have the burdens of his holding lightened.  And this I wish to
have done in such sort that, if one has a payment to make of one
*solidus*, a third should be remitted him; if of three or four, that one
*solidus* should be remitted; if of any more, the remission should still
be made in the same proportion, or at any rate according as thy Love
sees fit, so that one who is converted may have some relief of his
burden, and the Church may not be put to heavy expense.  Nor shall we do
this unprofitably, if by lightening the burdens of their payments we
bring them to the grace of Christ, since, though they themselves came
with little faith, yet those who may be born of them will now be
baptized with more faith:  thus we gain either them or their children. 
And whatever amount of payment we let them off for the sake of Christ is
nothing serious.  Furthermore, some time ago, when John the deacon came,
thy Love wrote something to me, the whole of which I read at the time,
but let many days intervene before replying; and then, after such delay,
replied to all particulars as I recollected them.  But now I think that
one point escaped my memory, and suspect that I gave no reply about it. 
For thou hadst written that loans were being advanced to peasants
(*rusticis*) through certain undertakers for their debt <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md) , lest in borrowing from others
they should be burdened either by exactions or by the prices of
things <span id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md) .  This particular was
to me most acceptable; and, if indeed I have already written about it,
observe what I wrote.  But if, as I suspect, I gave in my reply no
definite direction on the subject, thou must not hesitate to advance
money for the advantage of the peasants, since the ecclesiastical
property will not thus be wasted, and out of it the peasants will derive
advantage.  And, if there are other things which thou considerest to be
advantageous, thou must carry them out without any hesitation.

<span id="iii.v.v.iv-p5"></span> *Per manus quorundam debiti
conductorum*.  If the word *debiti*(absent from some <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.iv-p5.1"></span>mss.</span>) is read here,
the meaning may be that certain persons, called *debiti conductores*,
undertook the recovery of the arrears of the *rustici*, and that through
them easy loans were advanced to such as were unable to pay at the
proper time.  Cf. I. 44, p. 89.  For the ordinary meaning of
*conductores* (without *debiti*), in connexion with the Church estates,
see I. 44, p, 89, note 5.

<span id="fn_1579"></span>[164b:1580](2120458.htm#fr_1579.md) <span
id="iii.v.v.iv-p5.2"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v.iv-p6"></span> *Aut in angariis aut in rerum pretio*. 
The word *angaria* is applicable to any kind of vexatious exaction,
either in the way of forced labour or in other ways.  “Per angarias
intelliguntur vexationes et injuriæ quælibet.”  Du Cange.  It may be
used here for exorbitant interest on loans obtained from usurers.  As to
*rerum pretio*, cf. I. 44, p. 89, about *burdatio*, and note 2.
