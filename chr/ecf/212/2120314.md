id="iii.v.i.xii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XVI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xii-p2"></span>*To Severus, Bishop of Aquileia* <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316) .

<span id="iii.v.i.xii-p4"></span>Gregory to Severus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xii-p5"></span>As, when one who walks through devious
ways takes anew the right path, the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xii-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> embraces him with all
eagerness, so afterwards, when one deserts the way of truth, He is more
saddened with grief for him than He rejoiced over him with joy when he
turned from error; since it is a less degree of sin not to know the
truth than not to abide in it when known:  and what is committed in
error is one thing, but what is perpetrated knowingly is another.  And
we, from having formerly rejoiced in thy being incorporated in the unity
of the Church, are now the more abundantly distressed for thy
dissociation from the catholic society.  Accordingly we desire thee, at
the instance of the bearer of these presents, according to the command
of the most Christian and most serene Emperor, to come with thy
adherents to the threshold of the blessed Apostle Peter, that, a synod
being assembled by the will of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xii-p5.2"></span>God</span>, judgment may be passed
concerning the doubt that is entertained among you.

<span id="iii.v.i.xii-p3"></span> The bishops of Istria, of whom the
bishop Aquilea was Metropolitan, still refused to accept the decree of
the fifth Œcumenical Council, which had, under the dictation of the
Emperor Justinian, condemned certain writings of three deceased
prelates, Theodore of Mopsuesta, Theodoret and Ibas, called “the three
chapters” (*tria capitula*).  Severus the Metropolitan, summoned in this
letter with his suffragans to Rome, disregarded the summons, going
instead, at the instance of the Exarch Smaragdus, to Ravenna, where he
remained a year.  On his return to his See he still held out, though
many of his bishops conformed.  A schism hence ensued in Istria, which
continued during the life of Gregory (Joan. Diac. *Vit. S. Greg.* iv.
37, 38).  Other Epistles referring to the Istrian schism are II. 46, 51;
V. 51; IX. 9, 10; XIII. 33.
