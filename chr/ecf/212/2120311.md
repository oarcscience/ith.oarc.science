id="iii.v.i.ix-p1.1"></span>Epistle X.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.ix-p2"></span>To Bacauda and Agnellus, Bishops.

<span id="iii.v.i.ix-p3"></span>Gregory to Bacauda, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.ix-p4"></span>The Hebrews dwelling in Terracina have
petitioned us for licence to hold, under our authority, the site of
their synagogue which they have held hitherto.  But, inasmuch as we have
been informed that the same site is so near to the church that even the
sound of their psalmody reaches it, we have written to our brother and
fellow-bishop Peter that, if it is the case that the voices from the
said place are heard in the church, the Jews must cease to worship
there.  Therefore let your Fraternity, with our above-named brother and
fellow-bishop, diligently inspect this place, and if you find that there
has been any annoyance to the church, provide another place within the
fortress, where the aforesaid Hebrews may assemble, so that they may be
able to celebrate their ceremonies without impediment <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312) .  But let your Fraternity provide
such a place, in case of their being deprived of this one, that there be
no cause of complaint in future.  But we forbid the aforesaid Hebrews to
be oppressed or vexed unreasonably; but, <span id="page_78b">p.
78b</span> <span id="iii.v.i.ix-Page_78b"></span>as they are permitted,
in accordance with justice, to live under the protection of the Roman
laws, let them keep their observances as they have learnt them, no one
hindering them:  yet let it not be allowed them to have Christian
slaves.

<span id="iii.v.i.ix-p5"></span> For the result of this order, see
below, Ep. 35<span id="iii.v.i.ix-p5.1"></span>.  For other instances of
Gregory’s tolerant attitude towards Jews, and his deprecation of force
being used for their conversion, see that Epistle, and also I. 47; IX.
6.  But he is strict in prohibiting their possession of slaves who were
already, or might become, Christians, and will allow them no
compensation for the loss of such (cf. iii. 38; IV. 9, 21; IX. 109,
110).
