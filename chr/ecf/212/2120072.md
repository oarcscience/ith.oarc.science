<span id="ii.iv.lxii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.lxii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXVII <span

<span id="ii.iv.lxii-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.lxii-p3.1"></span>To Ravennius, Bishop of Arles.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.lxii-p4"></span>To his dearly-beloved brother Ravennius,
Leo the pope.

<span id="ii.iv.lxii-p5"></span> <span id="page_62">p. 62</span> <span
id="ii.iv.lxii-Page_62"></span>We have kept our sons Petronius the
presbyter, and Regulus the deacon, long in the City, both because they
deserved this from their favour in our eyes, and because the needs of
the Faith, which is now being assailed by the error of some, demanded
it.  For we wished them to be present when we discussed the matter, and
to ascertain everything which we desire through you, beloved, should
reach the knowledge of all our brethren and fellow-bishops, specially
deputing this to you, dear brother, that through your watchful diligence
our letter, which we have issued to the East in defence of the Faith, or
else <span id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401) that of Cyril of blessed
memory, which agrees throughout with our views, may become known to all
the brethren; in order that being furnished with arguments they may
fortify themselves with spiritual strength against those who think fit
to insult the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxii-p6.1"></span>Lord’s</span> Incarnation with their
misbeliefs.  You have a favourable opportunity, beloved brother, of
recommending the commencement of your episcopacy to all the churches and
to our <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.lxii-p6.2"></span>God</span>, if
you will carry out these things in the way we have charged and enjoined
you.  But the matters which were not to be committed to paper, in
reliance on <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxii-p6.3"></span>God’s</span> aid, you shall carry out
effectually, as we have said, and laudably, when you have learnt about
them from the mouths of our aforesaid sons.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxii-p6.4"></span>God</span> keep you safe, dearest brother. 
Dated 5th of May, in the consulship of the most glorious Valentinianus
(for the 7th time) and of the famous Avienus (450).

id="ii.iv.lxii-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.lxii-p2"></span> This letter, together with Letters XL.,
LXV. and LXVI., are found only in the Collection of Arles (numbered XV.
by the Ballerinii).

<span id="fn_401"></span>[62:402](2120072.htm#fr_401) <span
id="ii.iv.lxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.lxii-p6"></span> *Vel* can hardly equal *et* as the
Ball. would wish.  So that here Leo recommends *either* his own Tome
*or* Cyril’s second letter to Nestorius.  Cf. Letter LXIX., chap. i.
below; also Letter LXX.
