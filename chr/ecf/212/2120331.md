<span id="iii.v.i.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxix-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xxix-p2"></span>*To Anthemius, Subdeacon* <span
id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338.md) .

<span id="iii.v.i.xxix-p4"></span>Gregory to Anthemius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxix-p5"></span>John, our brother and fellow-bishop,
in a schedule sent to us by his cleric Justus, has among many other
things intimated to us as follows:  that some monks of the diocese of
Surrentum <span id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md) transmigrate from
monastery to monastery as they please, and depart from the rule of their
own abbot out of desire for a worldly life; nay even (what is known to
be unlawful) that they aim severally at having property of their own. 
Wherefore we command thy Experience by this present order, that no monk
be henceforth allowed to migrate from monastery to monastery, and that
thou permit not any one of them to have anything of his own.  But, if
any one whatever should so presume, let him be sent back with adequate
constraint to the monastery in which he lived at first, to be under the
rule of his own abbot from which he had escaped; lest, if we allow so
great an iniquity to take its course uncorrected, the souls of those
that are lost be required from the souls of their superiors.  Further,
if any of the clergy should chance to become monks, let it not be lawful
for them to return anew to the same church in which they had formerly
served, or to any other; unless one should be a monk of such a life that
the bishop under whom he had formerly served should think him worthy of
the priesthood, so that he may be chosen by him, and by him ordained to
such place as he may think fit.  And since we have learnt that some
among the monks have plunged into such great wickedness as publicly to
take to themselves wives, do thou seek them out with all vigilance, and,
when found, send them back with due constraint to the monasteries of
which they had been monks.  But neglect not to deal also with the clergy
who profess monasticism, as we have said above.  For so thou wilt be
pleasing in the eyes of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxix-p6.1"></span>God</span>, and be found partaker of a
full reward.
