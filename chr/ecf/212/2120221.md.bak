<span id="ii.v.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xliii-p1.1"></span>Sermon LXXXIV <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172.md) .</span>

<span id="ii.v.xliii-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xliii-p3.1"></span>Concerning the Neglect of the
Commemoration.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xliii-p4"></span>I.  *The Churchmen of Rome are in danger
of forgetting past judgments and mercies, and becoming ungrateful to
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xliii-p4.1"></span>God</span>.*

<span id="ii.v.xliii-p5"></span>The fewness of those who were present
has of itself shown, dearly-beloved, that the religious devotion
wherewith, in commemoration of the day of our chastisement and release,
the whole body of the faithful used to flock together in order to give
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xliii-p5.1"></span>God</span> thanks,
has on this last occasion been almost entirely neglected:  and this has
caused me much sadness of heart and great fear.  For there is much
danger of men becoming ungrateful to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xliii-p5.2"></span>God</span>, and through forgetfulness of His
benefits not feeling sorrow for the chastisement, nor joy for the
liberation.  Accordingly I fear, dearly-beloved, lest that utterance of
the Prophet be addressed in rebuke to such men, which says, “thou hast
scourged them and they have not grieved:  thou hast chastised them, and
they have refused to receive correction. <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173.md) ”  For what amendment is shown by
them in whom such aversion to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xliii-p6.2"></span>God’s</span> service is found?  One is
ashamed to say it, but one must not keep silence:  more is spent upon
demons than upon the Apostles, and mad spectacles draw greater crowds
than blessed martyrdoms <span id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174.md) . 
Who was it that restored this city to safety? that rescued it from
captivity? the games of the circus-goers or the care of the saints?
surely it was by the saints’ prayers that the sentence of Divine
displeasure was <span id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span
id="ii.v.xliii-Page_197"></span>diverted, so that we who deserved wrath,
were reserved for pardon.

<span id="ii.v.xliii-p8"></span>II.  *Let them avail themselves betimes
of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xliii-p8.1"></span>God’s</span>
long-suffering and return to Him.*

<span id="ii.v.xliii-p9"></span>I entreat you, beloved, let those words
of the Saviour touch your hearts, Who, when by the power of His mercy He
had cleansed ten lepers, said that only one of them all had returned to
give thanks <span id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175.md) :  meaning
without doubt that, though the ungrateful ones had gained soundness of
body, yet their failure in this godly duty arose from ungodliness of
heart.  And therefore, dearly-beloved, that this brand of ingratitude
may not be applied to you, return to the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xliii-p10.2"></span>Lord</span>, remembering the marvels which
He has deigned to perform among us; and ascribing our release not, as
the ungodly suppose, to the influences of the stars, but to the
unspeakable mercy of Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xliii-p10.3"></span>God</span>, Who has deigned to soften the
hearts of raging barbarians, betake yourselves to the commemoration of
so great a benefit with all the vigour of faith.  Grave neglect must be
atoned for by yet greater tokens of repentance.  Let us use the Mercy of
Him, Who has spared us, to our own amendment, that the blessed Peter and
all the saints, who have always been near us in many afflictions, may
deign to aid our entreaties for you to the merciful <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xliii-p10.4"></span>God</span>, through Jesus
Christ our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xliii-p10.5"></span>Lord</span>.  Amen.

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[196:1173](2120221.htm#fr_1172.md) <span
id="ii.v.xliii-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xliii-p2"></span> There is some doubt as to the exact
occasion of this sermon.  It seems to have been connected with the
yearly commemoration (not the first or second from the language Leo
uses), of that 14 days’ pillage of Rome by Genseric (in 455) and of the
city’s subsequent liberation, in which Leo took so important a part. 
But the date ascribed to the sermon’s delivery (the octave of SS. Peter
and Paul, i.e. July 6) does not tally well with its allusions to the
*ludi Circenses* as counter-attractions to the recent Church functions. 
A reference to Serm. IX. n. 6, will remind the reader that it was the
*ludi Apollinares* that, at least in the past, were associated with that
date:  perhaps Leo’s phrase *ludus Circensium* is only a general
description and would include the Apollinarian games as being still held
*in* *Circo* as well as others.  The *ludi Circenses* themselves were
held Sept. 4–12.
