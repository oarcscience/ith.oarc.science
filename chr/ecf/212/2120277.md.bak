<span id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p2"></span>How the obstinate and the fickle are
to be admonished.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p3"></span>(*Admonition* 19.)  Differently to be
admonished are the obstinate and the fickle.  The former are to be told
that they think more of themselves than they are, and therefore do not
acquiesce in the counsels of others:  but the latter are to be given to
understand that they undervalue and disregard themselves too much, and
so are turned aside from their own judgment in successive moments of
time.  Those are to be told that, unless they esteemed themselves better
than the rest of men, they would by no means set less value on the
counsels of all than on their own deliberation:  these are to be told
that, if they at all gave heed to what they are, the breeze of
mutability would by no means turn them about through so many sides of
variableness.  To the former it is said through Paul, *Be not wise in
your own conceits* ([Rom. xii. 16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p3.1"></span>):  but the latter on the other hand
should hear this; *Let us not be carried about with every wind of
doctrine* ([Ephes. iv. 14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p3.2"></span>).  Concerning the former it is said
through Solomon, *They shall eat of the fruits of their own way, and be
filled with their own devices* ([Prov. i.
31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p3.3"></span>); but concerning the latter it is
written by him again, *The heart of the foolish will be unlike* ([Prov.
15.7](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p3.4"></span>).  For the heart of the wise is always
like itself, because, while it rests in good persuasions, it directs
itself constantly in good performance.  But the heart of the foolish is
unlike, because, while it shews itself various through mutability, it
never remains what it was.  And since some vices, as out of themselves
they generate others, so themselves spring from others, it ought by all
means to be understood that we then better wipe these away by our
reproofs, when we dry them up from the very fountain of their
bitterness.  For obstinacy is engendered of pride, and fickleness of
levity.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p4"></span>The obstinate are therefore to be
admonished, that they acknowledge the haughtiness of their thoughts, and
study to vanquish themselves; lest, while they scorn to be overcome by
the right advice of others outside themselves, they be held captive
within themselves to pride.  They are to be admonished to observe wisely
how the Son of Man, Whose will is always one with the Father’s, that He
may afford us an example of subduing our own will, says, *I seek not
mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me* ([Joh. v.
30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p4.1"></span>).  And, still more to commend the grace
of this virtue, He declared beforehand that He would retain the same in
the last judgment, <span id="page_43b">p. 43b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xix-Page_43b"></span>saying, *I can of myself do nothing,
but as I hear I judge* ([John
5.30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p4.2"></span>.).  With what conscience, then, can a
man disdain to acquiesce in the will of another, seeing that the Son of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p4.3"></span>God</span> and of
Man, when He comes to shew forth the glory of his power, testifies that
of his own self he does not judge?

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p5"></span>But, on the other hand, the fickle
are to be admonished to strengthen their mind with gravity.  For they
then dry up the germs of mutability in themselves when they first cut
off from their heart the root of levity; since also a strong fabric is
built up when a solid place is first provided whereon to lay the
foundation.  Unless, then, levity of mind be previously guarded against,
inconstancy of the thoughts is by no means conquered.  From this Paul
declared himself to be free, when he said, *Did I use levity? or the
things that I purpose do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me
there should be yea and nay* ([2 Cor. i.
17](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p5.1"></span>)?  As if to say plainly, For this reason
I am moved by no breeze of mutability, that I yield not to the vice of
levity.
