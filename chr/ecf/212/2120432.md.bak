<span id="iii.v.iv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xi-p2"></span>To Maximianus, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xi-p3"></span>Gregory to Maximianus, Bishop of
Syracuse.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xi-p4"></span>It had indeed been committed to thy
Fraternity long ago by our authority to correct in our stead any
excesses or unseemly proceedings that there might be in the Church and
other venerable places of Sicily <span
id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533.md) .  But, seeing that a complaint has
reached us of some things having been so far neglected, we have thought
it fit that thy Fraternity should again be specially stirred up to
correct them.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xi-p6"></span>For we learn that in the case of
revenues of Churches that have been newly acquired the canonical
disposition of their fourth parts does not prevail <span
id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534.md) , but that the bishops of the
several places distribute a fourth part of the ancient revenues only,
retaining for their own use those that have been recently acquired. 
Wherefore let thy Fraternity make haste actively to correct this evil
custom that has crept in, so that, whether in the case of former
revenues or of such as have accrued now or may accrue, the fourth parts
may be dispensed according to the canonical distribution of them.  For
it is unseemly that one and the same substance of the Church should be
rated, as it were, under two different laws, namely, that of usurpation
and that of the canons.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xi-p8"></span>Permit not presbyters, deacons, and
other clerks of whatever order, who serve churches, to be abbots of
monasteries; but let them either, giving up clerical duties, be advanced
to the monastic order, or, if they should decide to remain in the
position of abbot, let them by no means be allowed to have clerical
employment.  For it is very unsuitable that, if one cannot fulfil the
duties of either of these positions with diligence proportional to its
importance, any one should be judged fit for both, and that so the
ecclesiastical order should impede the monastic life, and in turn the
rule of monasticism impede ecclesiastical utility.  Of this thing also
we have taken thought to warn thy Charity; that, if any one of the
bishops should depart this life, or (which <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xi-p8.1"></span>God</span> forbid) should be removed for
his transgressions, the hierarchs and all the chief of the clergy being
assembled, and in thy presence making an inventory of the property of
the Church, all that is found should be accurately described, and
nothing should be taken away in kind, or in any other way whatever, from
the property of the Church, as is said to have been done formerly, as
though in return for the trouble of making the inventories.  For we
desire all that pertains to the protection of what belongs to the poor
to be so executed that in their affairs no opportunity may be left for
the venality of self-interested men.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xi-p9"></span>Let visitors of churches, and their
clerks who with them are at trouble in parishes that are not of their
own city, receive according to thy appointment some subsidy for their
labour.  For it is just that they should get payment in the places where
they are found to lend their services.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xi-p10"></span>We most strongly forbid young women to
be made abbesses.  Let thy Fraternity, therefore, permit no bishop to
veil any but a sexagenarian virgin, whose age and character may demand
this being done; that so, this as well as the above-named points being
set right with the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xi-p10.1"></span>Lord’s</span> help by the urgency of thy
strict requirement, thou mayest hasten to bind up again with canonical
ties the long loosened state of venerable things, and also that divine
affairs may be arranged, not by the incongruous wills of men, but with
adequate strictness.  The month of October, Indiction 12.
