<span id="ii.iv.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Letter XXIX.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxix-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xxix-p2.1"></span>To Theodosius Augustus.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxix-p3"></span>To Cæsar Theodosius, the most religious
and devout Augustus Leo pope of the CatholicChurch of the city of
Rome <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md) .

<span id="ii.iv.xxix-p5"></span>He notifies the appointment of his
representatives at the Council of Ephesus.

<span id="ii.iv.xxix-p6"></span>How much <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxix-p6.1"></span>God’s</span> providence vouchsafes to
consult for the interests of men is shown by your merciful care which,
incited by <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxix-p6.2"></span>God’s</span> Spirit, is unwilling that there
should be any disturbance or difference:  since the Faith, which is
absolutely one, cannot be different from itself in any thing.  Hence
although Eutyches, as the minutes of the bishops’ proceeds reveals, has
been detected in an ignorant and unwise error, and ought to have
withdrawn from his conviction which is rightly condemned, yet since your
piety which loves the Catholic Truth with great jealousy for <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxix-p6.3"></span>God’s</span> honour, has
determined on a synodal judgment at Ephesus, that that Truth on <span
id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span id="ii.iv.xxix-Page_44"></span>which he
is blind may be brought home to the ignorant old man; I have sent my
brothers Julius the Bishop, Renatus the presbyter, and my son Hilary the
deacon to act as my representatives as the matter requires, and they
shall bring with them such a spirit of justice and kindness that while
the whole misguided error is condemned (for there can be no doubt as to
what is the integrity of the Christian Faith), yet if he who has gone
astray repents and entreats for pardon, he may receive the succour of
priestly indulgence:  seeing that in his appeal <span
id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) which he sent us, he reserved to
himself the right of earning our forgiveness by promising to correct
whatever our opinion disapproved of in his opinion.  But what the
catholic Church universally believes and teaches on the mystery of the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxix-p7.1"></span>Lord’s</span>
Incarnation is contained more fully in the letter which I have sent to
my brother and fellow-bishop Flavian.  Dated 13th June in the consulship
of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).

<span id="ii.iv.xxix-p4"></span> This is the title retained by Quesnel
and the Ballerinii, though many <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxix-p4.1"></span>mss.</span> exhibit the simpler
*gloriosissimo et clementissimo Theodosio Augusto Leo episcopus*, which
is favoured by the Gk. version <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.xxix-p4.2"></span>τῷ ἐνδοξοτάτῳ καὶ φιλανθρωποτάτῳ
κ.τ.λ</span>.  Quesnel takes occasion to warn us to distinguish between
this use of the title *papa* and that adopted later when it was
equivalent to *œcumenicus et universalis episcopus*.
