<span id="iii.v.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xiii-p2"></span>To Maurus, Abbot.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xiii-p3"></span>Gregory to Maurus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xiii-p4"></span>The care of churches which is
evidently inherent in the priestly office compels us to be so solicitous
that no fault of neglect may appear with regard to them.  Since,
however, we have learnt that the church of Saint Pancratius, which had
been committed to presbyters, has been frequently neglected, so that
people coming there on the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xiii-p4.1"></span>Lord’s</span> day to celebrate the
solemnities of mass have returned murmuring on finding no presbyter, we
therefore, after mature deliberation, have determined to remove those
presbyters, and with the favour of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xiii-p4.2"></span>God</span> constitute for the same church
a congregation of monks in a monastery, to the end that the abbot who
shall preside there may give care and attention in all respects to the
aforesaid church.  And we have also thought fit to put thee, Maurus,
over this monastery as abbot, ordaining that the lands of the aforesaid
church, and whatever may have come into its possession, or accrued from
its revenues, be applied to this thy monastery, and belong to it without
any diminution; but on condition whatever needs to be effected or
repaired in the church above written may be so effected and repaired by
thee without fail.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xiii-p5"></span>But lest, after the removal of the
presbyters to whom this church had previously been committed, it should
seem to be without provision for divine service, we therefore enjoin
thee by the tenour of this authority to supply it with a
*peregrine* <span id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537.md) presbyter to
celebrate the sacred solemnities of mass, who, nevertheless, must needs
both live in thy monastery, and have from it provision for his
maintenance.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xiii-p7"></span>But let this also above all be thy
care, that there over the most sacred body of the blessed Pancratius the
work of <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xiii-p7.1"></span>God</span>
be executed daily without fail.  These things, then, which by the tenour
of this precept we depute thee to do, we will that not only thou
perform, but that they be also so observed and fulfilled for ever by
those who shall succeed thee in thy office and place, that there may be
no possibility henceforth of neglect being found in the aforesaid
church.
