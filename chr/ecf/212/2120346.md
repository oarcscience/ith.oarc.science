<span id="iii.v.i.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xliv-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXVI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xliv-p2"></span>To Felix, Bishop of Messana (Messene).

<span id="iii.v.i.xliv-p3"></span>Gregory to Felix, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xliv-p4"></span>Customs which are found to bring a
burden upon churches it becomes us in our consideration to discontinue,
lest any should be forced to contribute to quarters from which they
ought rather to look for contributions.  Accordingly, it is thy duty to
preserve intact the custom of the clergy and others, and to transmit to
them every year what has been accustomed:  but for the future we forbid
thee to transmit anything to us.  And, since we take no delight in
presents (*xeniis*) <span id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md) , we have
received with thanks the Palmatianæ <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379.md) which thy Fraternity has sent us,
but have caused them to be sold for an adequate price, which we have
transmitted separately to thy Fraternity, for fear lest thou shouldest
have felt the expense.  Further, since we have learnt that thy Charity
is desirous of coming to us, we admonish thee by the present letter not
to take the trouble of coming:  but pray for us, that the more we are
separated by length of way, the more we may be joined one to another in
mind, with the help of Christ, by charity; to the end that, aiding each
other by mutual supplication, we may resign our office unimpaired to the
Judge that is to come.
