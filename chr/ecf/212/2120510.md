id="iii.v.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxiv-p2"></span>To Anthemius, Subdeacon.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxiv-p3"></span>Gregory to Anthemius, our Neapolitan
Sub-deacon <span id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657) .

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxiv-p5"></span>How great is our grief, and how great
the affliction of our heart, from what has taken place in the regions of
Campania we cannot express; but thou mayest thyself gather it from the
greatness of the calamity.  With regard to this state of things, we send
thy Experience by the magnificent Stephen, bearer of these presents,
money for the succour of the captives who have been taken, admonishing
thee that thou give thy whole attention to the business, and carry it
out strenuously; and, in the case of freemen whom thou knowest to have
no sufficient means for their own redemption, that thou make haste to
redeem them.  But, should there be any slaves, and thou findest that
their masters are so poor that they cannot come forward to redeem them,
hesitate not to recover them also.  In like manner also thou wilt take
care to redeem the slaves of the Church who have been lost by thy
neglect.  Further, whomsoever thou shalt have redeemed, thou wilt by all
means be at pains to make out a list, containing their names, and a
statement of where each is staying, and what he is doing, and where he
came from; which list thou mayest bring with thee when thou comest. 
Moreover, hasten to shew thyself so diligent in this business that those
who are to be redeemed may incur no risk through thy negligence, or thou
come afterwards to be highly culpable before us.  But work especially
for this also; that, if possible, thou mayest be able to recover those
captives at a moderate price.  But set down in writing, with all
clearness and nicety, the whole sum expended, and transmit to us this
thy written account with speed.  The month of May, Indiction 14.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxiv-p4"></span> The occasion of this letter seems to
have been some recent aggression of the Lombards in the Neopolitan
district, resulting in the capture of many prisoners of war.
