<span id="iii.v.i.v"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.v-p1.1"></span>Epistle V.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.v-p2"></span>To Theoctista, Sister of the Emperor.

<span id="iii.v.i.v-p3"></span>Gregory to Theoctista, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.v-p4"></span>With how great devotion my mind
prostrates itself before your Venerableness I cannot fully express in
words; nor yet do I labour to give utterance to it, since, even though I
were silent, you read in your heart your own sense <span
id="page_75b">p. 75b</span> <span id="iii.v.i.v-Page_75b"></span>of my
devotion.  I wonder, however, that you withdrew your countenance, till
of late bestowed on me, from this my recent engagement in the pastoral
office; wherein, under colour of episcopacy, I have been brought back to
the world; in which I am involved in such great earthly cares as I do
not at all remember having been subjected to even in a lay state of
life.  For I have lost the deep joys of my quiet, and seem to have risen
outwardly while inwardly falling down.  Whence I grieve to find myself
banished far from the face of my Maker.  For I used to strive daily to
win my way outside the world, outside the flesh; to drive all phantasms
of the body from the eyes of my soul, and to see incorporeally supernal
joys; and not only with my voice but in the core of my heart I used to
say, *My heart hath said unto Thee, I have sought Thy face, Thy face,
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.v-p4.1"></span>Lord</span>, will I
seek* ([Ps. xxvi. 8](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.v.i.v-p4.2"></span>).  Moreover desiring nothing, fearing
nothing, in this world, I seemed to myself to stand on a certain summit
of things, so that I almost believed to be fulfilled in me what I had
learnt of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.v-p4.3"></span>Lord’s</span> promise through the prophet, *I
will lift thee up upon the high places of the earth* ([Isa.
1:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000.md), [Isa.
58:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.v.i.v-p4.4"></span>).  For he is lifted up upon the high places
of the earth who treads under foot through looking down upon them in his
mind even the very things of the present world which seem lofty and
glorious.  But, having been suddenly dashed from this summit of things
by the whirlwind of this trial, I have fallen into fears and tremors,
since, even though I have no fears for myself, I am greatly afraid for
those who have been committed to me.  On every side I am tossed by the
waves of business, and sunk by storms, so that I may truly say, *I am
come into the depth of the sea, and the storm hath overwhelmed me*
([Psa. 69.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.v.i.v-p4.5"></span> <span id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299.md)
).  After business I long to return to my heart; but, driven therefrom
by vain tumults of thoughts, I am unable to return.  From this cause,
then, that which is within me is made to be far from me, so that I
cannot obey the prophetic voice which says, *Return to your heart,
transgressors* ([Isa. 1:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000.md), [Isa.
46:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.v.i.v-p5.1"></span>).  But, pressed by foolish thoughts, I am
impelled only to exclaim, *My heart hath failed me* ([Psa.
40.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.v.i.v-p5.2"></span> <span id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300.md)
).  I have loved the beauty of the contemplative life as a Rachel,
barren, but keen of sight and fair ([Gen.
xxix](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#000.md)<span
id="iii.v.i.v-p6.1"></span>.), who, though in her quietude she is less
fertile, yet sees the light more keenly.  But, by what judgment I know
not, Leah has been coupled with me in the night, to wit, the active
life; fruitful, but tender-eyed; seeing less, but bringing forth more. 
I have longed to sit at the feet of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.v-p6.2"></span>Lord</span> with Mary, to take in the words
of His mouth; and lo, I am compelled to serve with Martha in external
affairs, to be careful and troubled about many things ([Luke x.
39](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#039.md)<span id="iii.v.i.v-p6.3"></span>,
*seq.*).  A legion of demons having been, as I believed, cast out of me,
I wished to forget those whom I had known, and to rest at the feet of
the Saviour; and lo it is said to me, so as to compel me against my
will, *Return to thine house, and declare how great things the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.v-p6.4"></span>Lord</span> hath done for
thee* ([Mark v. 19](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.v.i.v-p6.5"></span>).  But who in the midst of so many earthly
cares may be able to preach the wondrous works of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.v-p6.6"></span>God</span>, it being already difficult for me
even to call them to mind?  For, pressed as I am in this office of
dignity by a crowd of secular occupations, I see myself to be of those
of whom it is written, *While they were being raised up thou didst cast
them down* ([Psa. 73.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.v.i.v-p6.7"></span> <span id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md)
).  For he said not, Thou didst cast them down after they had been
raised up, but while they were being raised up; because all bad men fall
inwardly, while through the support of temporal dignity they seem
outwardly to rise.  Wherefore their very raising up is their fall,
because, while they rely on false glory, they are emptied of true
glory.  Hence, again, he says, *Consuming away as smoke shall they
consume away* ([Psa. 37.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.v.i.v-p7.1"></span> <span id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md)
).  For smoke in rising consumes away, and in extending itself
vanishes.  And so indeed it comes to pass when present felicity
accompanies the life of a sinner, since whereby he is shewn to be
exalted, thereby it is brought about that he should cease to be.  Hence,
again, it is written, *My <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.v-p8.1"></span>God</span>, make them like a wheel* ([Psa.
83.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.v.i.v-p8.2"></span> <span id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md)
).  For a wheel is lifted up in its hinder parts, and in its fore parts
falls.  But to us the things that are behind are the goods of the
present world, which we leave behind us; but the things that are before
are those which are eternal and permanent, to which we are called, as
Paul bears witness, saying, *Forgetting those things which are behind,
and reaching forth to those things which are before* ([Phil. iii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013)<span id="iii.v.i.v-p9.1"></span>.md). 
The sinner, therefore, when he is advanced in the present life, is made
to be as a wheel, since, while falling in the things which are before,
he is lifted up in the things which are behind.  For, when he enjoys in
this life the glory which he must leave behind, he falls from that which
comes after this life.  There are indeed many who know how so to control
their outward advancement as by no means to fall inwardly thereby. 
Whence it is written, *<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.v-p9.2"></span>God</span> casteth not away the mighty,
seeing that He also Himself is mighty* ([Job xxxvi.
5](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#005)<span id="iii.v.i.v-p9.3"></span>.md). 
And it is said through Solomon, <span id="page_76b">p. 76b</span> <span
id="iii.v.i.v-Page_76b"></span>*A man of understanding shall possess
governments* ([Prov. i. 5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.v.i.v-p9.4"></span>).  But to me these things are difficult,
since they are also exceedingly burdensome; and what the mind has not
received willingly it does not control fitly.  Lo, our most serene <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.v-p9.5"></span>Lord</span> the Emperor has
ordered an ape to be made a lion.  And, indeed, in virtue of his order
it can be called a lion, but a lion it cannot be made.  Wherefore his
Piety must needs himself take the blame of all my faults and
short-comings, having committed a ministry of power to a weak agent.
