<span id="iii.v.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Epistle V.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.v-p2"></span>To Boniface, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iv.v-p3"></span>Gregory to Boniface, Bishop of Regium
(*Reii*).

<span id="iii.v.iv.v-p4"></span>It is a shame for priests to be
admonished about matters of divine worship.  For they are then to their
disgrace required to do what they ought themselves to require to be
done.  Yet lest, as I do not suppose, thy Fraternity should neglect in
any respect the things that pertain to the work of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.v-p4.1"></span>God</span>, we have thought
fit to exhort thee specially on this very head.  We therefore admonish
thee that the clergy of the city of Regium be to no extent released by
the indulgence of thy Fraternity in duties demanded by their office. 
But in the things that pertain to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.v-p4.2"></span>God</span> let them be most instantly and
most earnestly compelled.  We desire thee also to study the reputation
of the aforesaid clergy, that nothing bad, nothing that at all
contravenes ecclesiastical discipline, be heard of them; seeing that it
is to its adornment, not to foulness of deeds, that their office
appertains.  Further, we decree that what we determined in the case of
the Sicilians be observed by thy subdeacons <span
id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526.md) ; nor mayest thou suffer this our
decision to be infringed by the contumacy or temerity of any one
whatever; that so, as we believe will be the case, all that has been
said above being most strictly kept in force by thee, thou mayest
neither prove a transgressor of our admonition, nor be accused as guilty
of remissness in the order of pastoral rule which has been committed to
thee.
