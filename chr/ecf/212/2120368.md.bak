<span id="iii.v.ii.xiii-p2"></span>To John, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xiii-p3"></span>Gregory to John, &c.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xiii-p4"></span>Inasmuch as we have enjoined on our
brother and fellow-bishop Paulus the work of the visitation of the
Neapolitan church, therefore let not Fraternity shrink from assuming the
visitation of the Nepesine Church, to the end that, according to the
requirements of the Paschal festivity, whatever the solemnity of divine
service demands may, through thy operation, be in all respects
fulfilled.  Until, then, we may be able to consider what should be done
with regard to our aforesaid brother and fellow-bishop, let thy
Fraternity strive to shew thyself so skilful and vigilant in all things
that the absence of the bishop aforesaid may not at all be felt <span
