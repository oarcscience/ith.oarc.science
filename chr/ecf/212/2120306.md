id="iii.v.i.iv-p1.1"></span>Epistle IV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.iv-p2"></span>*To John, Bishop of
Constantinople* <span id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298) .

<span id="iii.v.i.iv-p4"></span>Gregory to John, Bishop of
Constantinople.

<span id="iii.v.i.iv-p5"></span>If the virtue of charity consists in the
love of one’s neighbour, and we are commanded to love our neighbours as
ourselves, how is it that your Blessedness does not love me even as
yourself?  For I know with what ardour, with what anxiety, you wished to
fly from the burden of the episcopate; and yet you made no opposition to
this same burden of the episcopate being imposed on me.  It is evident,
then, that you do not love me as yourself, seeing that you have wished
me to take on myself that load which you were unwilling should be
imposed on you.  But since I, unworthy and weak, have taken charge of an
old and grievously shattered ship (for on all sides the waves enter, and
the planks, battered by a daily and violent storm, sound of shipwreck),
I beseech thee by Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.iv-p5.1"></span>God</span> to stretch out the hand of thy
prayer to me in this my danger, since thou canst pray the more
strenuously as thou standest further removed from the confusion of the
tribulations which we suffer in this land.

<span id="iii.v.i.iv-p6"></span>My synodical epistle I will transmit
with all possible speed, having despatched Bacauda, our brother and
fellow-bishop, immediately after my ordination, as the bearer of this
letter, while pressed by many and serious engagements.
