, soothed (as has been written to us) by the charm of avarice, put off avenging the injury done to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xx-p6.1"></A>God</span>.&#160; But let your Glory institute a strict examination into all these things, and, if it should be found manifest that such things have been done, make haste to visit   <A NAME="page_132b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 132b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.iii.xx-Page_132b"></A>them most strictly and corporally on this wicked Jew, in such sort that you may thereby both conciliate the favour of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xx-p6.2"></A>God</span> to yourself, and shew yourself by this example, to your own reward, a model to posterity.&#160; Moreover, set at liberty, without any equivocation, according to the injunctions of the laws&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1492"></A><A HREF="#fn_1492"><FONT SIZE="1">1493</FONT></A>
, whatever Christian slaves it shall appear that he has acquired; lest (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xx-p7.1"></A>God</span> forbid) the Christian religion should be polluted by being subjected to Jews.&#160; Do you therefore with all speed correct these things most strictly, that not only may we give thanks to you for this discipline, but also bear testimony to your goodness in case of need.</p>
