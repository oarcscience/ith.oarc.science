<span id="ii.iv.xxviii"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Letter XXVIII.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p2.1"></span>To Flavian commonly called “the
Tome.”</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p3"></span>I.  *Eutyches has been driven into his
error by presumption and ignorance* <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) .

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p5"></span>Having read your letter, beloved, at
the late arrival of which we are surprised <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) , and having perused the detailed
account of the bishops’ acts <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) ,
we have at last found out what the scandal was which had arisen among
you against the purity of the Faith:  and what before seemed concealed
has now been unlocked and laid open to our view:  from which it is shown
that Eutyches, who used to seem worthy of all respect in virtue of his
priestly office, is very unwary and exceedingly ignorant, so that it is
even of him that the prophet has said:  “he refused to understand so as
to do well:  he thought upon iniquity in his bed <span
id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) .”  But what more iniquitous than to
hold blasphemous opinions <span id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) , and
not to give way to those who are wiser and more learned than ourself. 
Now into this unwisdom fall they who, finding themselves hindered from
knowing the truth by some obscurity, have recourse not to the prophets’
utterances, not to the Apostles’ letters, nor to the injunctions of the
Gospel but to their own selves:  and thus they stand out as masters of
error because they were never disciples of truth.  For what learning has
he acquired about the pages of the New and Old Testament, who has not
even grasped the rudiments of the Creed?  And that which, throughout the
world, is professed by the mouth of every one who is to be born
again <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) , is not yet taken in by
the heart of this old man.

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p11"></span>II.  *Concerning the twofold nativity
and nature of Christ.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p12"></span>Not knowing, therefore, what he was
bound to think concerning the incarnation of the Word of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p12.1"></span>God</span>, and not
wishing to gain the light of knowledge by researches through the length
<span id="page_39">p. 39</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-Page_39"></span>and breadth of the Holy Scriptures, he
might at least have listened attentively to that general and uniform
confession, whereby the whole body of the faithful confess that they
*believe in <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p12.2"></span>God</span> the Father Almighty, and in
Jesus Christ, His only Son* <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) *,
our <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p13.2"></span>Lord</span>,
who was born of the Holy Spirit and* <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) *the Virgin Mary.*  By which three
statements the devices of almost all heretics are overthrown.  For not
only is <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p14.1"></span>God</span>
believed to be both Almighty and the Father, but the Son is shown to be
co-eternal with Him, differing in nothing from the Father because He is
*<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p14.2"></span>God</span> from
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p14.3"></span>God</span>* <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) , Almighty from Almighty, and being
born from the Eternal one is co-eternal with Him; not later in point of
time, not lower in power, not unlike in glory, not divided in essence: 
but at the same time the only begotten of the eternal Father was born
eternal of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary.  And this nativity which
took place in time took nothing from, and added nothing to that divine
and eternal birth, but expended itself wholly on the restoration of man
who had been deceived <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) :  in
order that he might both vanquish death and overthrow by his
strength <span id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) , the Devil who
possessed the power of death.  For we should not now be able to overcome
the author of sin and death unless He took our nature on Him and made it
His own, whom neither sin could pollute nor death retain.  Doubtless
then, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit within the womb of His Virgin
Mother, who brought Him forth without the loss of her virginity, even as
she conceived Him without its loss.

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p18"></span>But if he could not draw a rightful
understanding (of the matter) from this pure source of the Christian
belief, because he had darkened the brightness of the clear truth by a
veil of blindness peculiar to himself, he might have submitted himself
to the teaching of the Gospels.  And when Matthew speaks of “the Book of
the Generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of
Abraham <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) ,” he might have also
sought out the instruction afforded by the statements of the Apostles. 
And reading in the Epistle to the Romans, “Paul, a servant of Jesus
Christ, called an Apostle, separated unto the Gospel of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p19.2"></span>God</span>, which He had
promised before by His prophets in the Holy Scripture concerning His
son, who was made unto Him <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) of
the seed of David after the flesh <span
id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) ,” he might have bestowed a loyal
carefulness upon the pages of the prophets.  And finding the promise of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p21.2"></span>God</span> who
says to Abraham, “In thy seed shall all nations be blest <span
id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) ,” to avoid all doubt as to the
reference of this seed, he might have followed the Apostle when He says,
“To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed.  He saith not and to
seeds, as if in many, but as it in one, and to thy seed which is
Christ <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) .”  Isaiah’s prophecy
also he might have grasped by a closer attention to what he says,
“Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son and they shall call His
name Immanuel,” which is interpreted “<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p23.2"></span>God</span> with us <span
id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) .”  And the same prophet’s words he
might have read faithfully.  “A child is born to us, a Son is given to
us, whose power is upon His shoulder, and they shall call His name the
Angel of the Great Counsel, Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p24.2"></span>God</span>, the Prince
of Peace, the Father of the age to come <span
id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) .”  And then he would not speak so
erroneously as to say that the Word became flesh in such a way that
Christ, born of the Virgin’s womb, had the form of man, but had not the
reality of His mother’s body <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) . 
Or is it possible that he thought our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p26.1"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ was not of our
nature for this reason, that the angel, who was sent to the blessed Mary
ever Virgin, says, “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of
the Most High shall overshadow thee:  and therefore that Holy Thing also
that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p26.2"></span>God <span
id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) </span>,” on the supposition that as
the conception of the Virgin was a Divine act, the flesh of the
conceived did not partake of the conceiver’s nature?  But that birth so
uniquely wondrous and so wondrously unique, is not to be understood in
such wise that the properties of His kind were removed through the
novelty of His creation.  For though the Holy Spirit imparted fertility
to the Virgin, yet a real body was received from her body; and, “Wisdom
building her a house <span id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) ,” “the
Word became flesh and dwelt in us <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) ,” that is, in that flesh which he
took from man and which he quickened with the breath of a higher
life <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) .

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p31"></span> <span id="page_40">p. 40</span>
<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-Page_40"></span>III.  *The Faith and counsel of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p31.1"></span>God</span> in
regard to the incarnation of the Word are set forth.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p32"></span>Without detriment therefore to the
properties of either nature and substance which then came together in
one person <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) , majesty took on
humility, strength weakness, eternity mortality:  and for the paying off
of the debt belonging to our condition inviolable nature was united with
possible nature, so that, as suited the needs of our case <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) , one and the same Mediator between
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p34.1"></span>God</span> and
men, the Man Christ Jesus, could both die with the one and not die with
the other.   <span id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) Thus in the whole
and perfect nature of true man was true <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p35.1"></span>God</span> born, complete in what was His
own, complete in what was ours.  And by “ours” we mean what the Creator
formed in us from the beginning and what He undertook to repair.  For
what the Deceiver brought in and man deceived committed, had no trace in
the Saviour.  Nor, because He partook of man’s weaknesses, did He
therefore share our faults.  He took the form of a slave <span
id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md) without stain of sin, increasing the
human and not diminishing the divine:  because that emptying of Himself
whereby the Invisible made Himself visible and, Creator and <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p36.2"></span>Lord</span> of all
things though He be, wished to be a mortal, was the bending down <span
id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) of pity, not the failing of power. 
Accordingly He who while remaining in the form of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p37.1"></span>God</span> made man, was also made man in
the form of a slave.  For both natures retain their own proper character
without loss:  and as the form of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p37.2"></span>God</span> did not do away with the form
of a slave, so the form of a slave did not impair the form of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p37.3"></span>God</span>.  For
inasmuch as the Devil used to boast that man had been cheated by his
guile into losing the divine gifts, and bereft of the boon of
immortality had undergone sentence of death, and that he had found some
solace in his troubles from having a partner in delinquency <span
id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) , and that <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p38.1"></span>God</span> also at the demand of the
principle of justice had changed His own purpose towards man whom He had
created in such honour:  there was need for the issue of a secret
counsel, that the unchangeable <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p38.2"></span>God</span> whose will cannot be robbed of
its own kindness, might carry out the first design of His Fatherly
care <span id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) towards us by a more hidden
mystery <span id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md) ; and that man who had
been driven into his fault by the treacherous cunning of the devil might
not perish contrary to the purpose of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p40.2"></span>God <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) </span>.

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p42"></span>IV.  *The properties of the twofold
nativity and nature of Christ are weighed one against another.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p43"></span>There enters then these lower parts
of the world the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p43.1"></span>God</span>, descending from His heavenly
home and yet not quitting His Father’s glory, begotten in a new order by
a new nativity.  In a new order, because being invisible in His own
nature, He became visible in ours, and He whom nothing could contain was
content to be contained <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) : 
abiding before all time He began to be in time:  the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p48.1"></span>Lord</span> of all
things, He obscured His immeasurable majesty and took on Him the form of
a servant:  being <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p48.2"></span>God</span> that cannot suffer, He did not
disdain to be man that can, and, immortal as He is, to subject Himself
to the laws of death.  The <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p48.3"></span>Lord</span> assumed His mother’s nature
without her faultiness:  nor in the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p48.4"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, born of the
Virgin’s womb, does the wonderfulness of His birth make His nature
unlike ours.  For He who is true <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p48.5"></span>God</span> is also true man:  and in this
union there is no lie <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) , since
the humility of manhood and the loftiness of the Godhead both meet
there.  For as <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p49.1"></span>God</span> is not changed by the showing
of pity, so man is not swallowed up by the dignity.  For each form does
what is proper to it with the co-operation of the other <span
id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) ; that is the Word performing what
appertains to the Word, and the flesh carrying out what appertains to
the flesh.  One of <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-Page_41"></span>them sparkles with miracles, the other
succumbs to injuries.  And as the Word does not cease to be on an
equality with His Father’s glory, so the flesh does not forego the
nature of our race.  For it must again and again be repeated that one
and the same is truly Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p50.1"></span>God</span> and truly son of man.  <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p50.2"></span>God</span> in that “in
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p50.3"></span>God</span>, and the Word was <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p50.4"></span>God <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) </span>;” man in that “the Word became
flesh and dwelt in us <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) .”  <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p52.2"></span>God</span> in that “all
things were made by Him <span id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) , and
without Him was nothing made:”  man in that “He was made of a woman,
made under law <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) .”  The nativity
of the flesh was the manifestation of human nature:  the childbearing of
a virgin is the proof of Divine power.  The infancy of a babe is shown
in the humbleness of its cradle <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md)
:  the greatness of the Most High is proclaimed by the angels’
voices <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md) .  He whom Herod
treacherously endeavours to destroy is like ourselves in our earliest
stage <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) :  but He whom the Magi
delight to worship on their knees is the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p57.1"></span>Lord</span> of all.  So too when He came
to the baptism of John, His forerunner, lest He should not be known
through the veil of flesh which covered His Divinity, the Father’s voice
thundering from the sky, said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md) .”  And thus Him
whom the devil’s craftiness attacks as man, the ministries of angels
serve as <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p58.2"></span>God</span>.  To be hungry and thirsty, to
be weary, and to sleep, is clearly human:  but to satisfy 5,000 men with
five loaves, and to bestow on the woman of Samaria living water,
droughts of which can secure the drinker from thirsting any more, to
walk upon the surface of the sea with feet that do not sink, and to
quell the risings of the waves by rebuking the winds, is, without any
doubt, Divine.  Just as therefore, to pass over many other instances, it
is not part of the same nature to be moved to tears of pity for a dead
friend, and when the stone that closed the four-days’ grave was removed,
to raise that same friend to life with a voice of command:  or, to hang
on the cross, and turning day to night, to make all the elements
tremble:  or, to be pierced with nails, and yet open the gates of
paradise to the robber’s faith:  so it is not part of the same nature to
say, “I and the Father are one,” and to say, “the Father is greater than
I <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) .”  For although in the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p59.3"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p59.4"></span>God</span> and man
is one person, yet the source of the degradation, which is shared by
both, is one, and the source of the glory, which is shared by both, is
another.  For His manhood, which is less than the Father, comes from our
side:  His Godhead, which is equal to the Father, comes from the Father.

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p60"></span>V.  *Christ’s flesh is proved real
from Scripture.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p61"></span>Therefore in consequence of this
unity of person which is to be understood in both natures <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) , we read of the Son of Man also
descending from heaven, when the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p62.3"></span>God</span> took flesh from the Virgin who
bore Him.  And again the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p62.4"></span>God</span> is said to have been crucified
and buried, although it was not actually in His Divinity whereby the
Only-begotten is co-eternal and con-substantial with the Father, but in
His weak human nature that He suffered these things.  And so it is that
in the Creed also we all confess that the Only-begotten Son of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p62.5"></span>God</span> was crucified
and buried, according to that saying of the Apostle:  “for if they had
known, they would never have crucified the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p62.6"></span>Lord</span> of glory <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) .”  But when our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p63.2"></span>Lord</span> and Saviour
Himself would instruct His disciples’ faith by His questionings, He
said, “Whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”  And when they had
put on record the various opinions of other people, He said, “But *ye*,
whom do ye say that I am?”  Me, that is, who am the Son of Man, and whom
ye see in the form of a slave, and in true flesh, whom do ye say that I
am?  Whereupon blessed Peter, whose divinely inspired confession was
destined to profit all nations, said, “Thou art Christ, the Son of the
living <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p63.3"></span>God <span
id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) </span>.”  And not undeservedly was he
pronounced blessed by the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p64.2"></span>Lord</span>, drawing from the chief
corner-stone <span id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) the solidity of
power which his name also expresses, he, who, through the revelation of
the Father, confessed Him to be at once Christ <span id="page_42">p.
42</span> <span id="ii.iv.xxviii-Page_42"></span>and Son of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p65.4"></span>God</span>:  because the
receiving of the one of these without the other was of no avail to
salvation, and it was equally perilous to have believed the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p65.5"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ
to be either only <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p65.6"></span>God</span> without man, or only man
without <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p65.7"></span>God</span>.  But after the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p65.8"></span>Lord’s</span>
resurrection (which, of course, was of His true body, because He was
raised the same as He had died and been buried), what else was effected
by the forty days’ delay than the cleansing of our faith’s purity from
all darkness?  For to that end He talked with His disciples, and dwelt
and ate with them, He allowed Himself to be handled with diligent and
curious touch by those who were affected by doubt, He entered when the
doors were shut upon the Apostles, and by His breathing upon them gave
them the Holy Spirit <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) , and
bestowing on them the light of understanding, opened the secrets of the
Holy Scriptures <span id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) .  So again He
showed the wound in His side, the marks of the nails, and all the signs
of His quite recent suffering, saying, “See My hands and feet, that it
is I.  Handle Me and see that a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye
see Me have <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) ;” in order that the
properties of His Divine and human nature might be acknowledged to
remain still inseparable:  and that we might know the Word not to be
different from the flesh, in such a sense as also to confess that the
one Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p68.2"></span>God</span> is both the Word and
flesh <span id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) .  Of this mystery of the
faith <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) your opponent Eutyches
must be reckoned to have but little sense if he has recognized our
nature in the Only-begotten of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p70.1"></span>God</span> neither through the
humiliation of His having to die, nor through the glory of His rising
again.  Nor has he any fear of the blessed apostle and evangelist John’s
declaration when he says, “every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ to
have come in the flesh, is of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p70.2"></span>God</span>:  and every spirit which
destroys Jesus is not of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p70.3"></span>God</span>, and this is Antichrist <span
id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) .”  But what is “to destroy Jesus,”
except to take away the human nature from Him, and to render void the
mystery, by which alone we were saved, by the most barefaced fictions. 
The truth is that being in darkness about the nature of Christ’s body,
he must also be befooled by the same blindness in the matter of His
sufferings.  For if he does not think the cross of the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p71.5"></span>Lord</span> fictitious,
and does not doubt that the punishment He underwent to save the world is
likewise true, let him acknowledge the flesh of Him whose death he
already believes:  and let him not disbelieve Him man with a body like
ours, since he acknowledges Him to have been able to suffer:  seeing
that the denial of His true flesh is also the denial of His bodily
suffering.  If therefore he receives the Christian faith, and does not
turn away his ears from the preaching of the Gospel:  let him see what
was the nature that hung pierced with nails on the wooden cross, and,
when the side of the Crucified was opened by the soldier’s spear, let
him understand whence it was that blood and water flowed, that the
Church of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p71.6"></span>God</span> might be watered from the font
and from the cup <span id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) .  Let him hear
also the blessed Apostle Peter, proclaiming that the sanctification of
the Spirit takes place through the sprinkling of Christ’s blood <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) .  And let him not read cursorily the
same Apostle’s words when he says, “Knowing that not with corruptible
things, such as silver and gold, have ye been redeemed from your vain
manner of life which is part of your fathers’ tradition, but with the
precious blood of Jesus Christ as of a lamb without spot and
blemish <span id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) .”  Let him not resist
too the witness of the blessed Apostle John, who says:  “and the blood
of Jesus the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p74.2"></span>God</span> cleanseth us from all
sin <span id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300.md) .”  And again:  “this is the
victory which overcometh the world, our faith.”  And “who is He that
overcometh the world save He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p75.2"></span>God</span>.  This
is He that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ:  not by water only,
but by water and blood.  And it is the Spirit that testifieth, because
the Spirit is the truth <span id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) ,
because there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, the water and the
blood, and the three are one <span id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md) .” 
The Spirit, that is, of sanctification, and the blood of redemption, and
the water of baptism:  because the three are one, and remain undivided,
and none of them is separated from this connection; because the catholic
Church lives and progresses by this faith, so that in Christ Jesus
neither the manhood without the true Godhead nor <span id="page_43">p.
43</span> <span id="ii.iv.xxviii-Page_43"></span>the Godhead without the
true manhood is believed in.

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p78"></span>VI.  *The wrong and mischievous
concession of Eutyches.  The terms on which he may be restored to
Communion.  The sending of deputies to the east.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p79"></span>But when during your
cross-examination Eutyches replied and said, “I confess that our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p79.1"></span>Lord</span> had two
natures before the union but after the union I confess but one <span
id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) ,” I am surprised that so absurd and
mistaken a statement of his should not have been criticised and rebuked
by his judges, and that an utterance which reaches the height of
stupidity and blasphemy should be allowed to pass as if nothing
offensive had been heard:  for the impiety of saying that the Son of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p80.1"></span>God</span> was of
two natures before His incarnation is only equalled by the iniquity of
asserting that there was but one nature in Him after “the Word became
flesh.”  And to the end that Eutyches may not think this a right or
defensible opinion because it was not contradicted by any expression of
yourselves, we warn you beloved brother, to take anxious care that if
ever through the inspiration of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p80.2"></span>God’s</span> mercy the case is brought to
a satisfactory conclusion, his ignorant mind be purged from this
pernicious idea as well as others.  He was, indeed, just beginning to
beat a retreat from his erroneous conviction, as the order of
proceedings shows <span id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md) , in so far as
when hemmed in by your remonstrances he agreed to say what he had not
said before and to acquiesce in that belief to which before he had been
opposed.  However, when he refused to give his consent to the
anathematizing of his blasphemous dogma, you understood, brother <span
id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md) , that he abode by his treachery and
deserved to receive a verdict of condemnation.  And yet, if he grieves
over it faithfully and to good purpose, and, late though it be,
acknowledges how rightly the bishops’ authority has been set in motion;
or if with his own mouth and hand in your presence he recants his wrong
opinions, no mercy that is shown to him when penitent can be found fault
with <span id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) :  because our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p83.1"></span>Lord</span>, that true
and “good shepherd” who laid down His life for His sheep <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) and who came to save not lose men’s
souls <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) , wishes us to imitate His
kindness <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) ; in order that while
justice constrains us when we sin, mercy may prevent our rejection when
we have returned.  For then at last is the true Faith most profitably
defended when a false belief is condemned even by the supporters of it.

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p87"></span>Now for the loyal and faithful
execution of the whole matter, we have appointed to represent us our
brothers Julius <span id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) Bishop and
Renatus <span id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) priest \[of the Title of
S. Clement\], as well as my son Hilary <span
id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) , deacon.  And with them we have
associated Dulcitius our notary, whose faith is well approved:  being
sure that the Divine help will be given us, so that he who had erred may
be saved when the wrongness of his view has been condemned.  <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p90.1"></span>God</span> keep you
safe, beloved brother.

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p91"></span>The 13 June, 449, in the consulship

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p4"></span> The original word (*imperitia*)
implies that a recluse like Eutyches (an archimandrite of a convent)
ought never to have entered into a nice controversy like the present: 
he has not enough *savoir faire*, and his knowledge is not quite up to
date, is a little old-fashioned.

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p10"></span> Knowledge of and belief in the
principles of the Faith as contained in the Creed (*symbolum*) have of
course always been required before Baptism from very early times.  Leo
here calls catechumens *regenerandi*, just as those who are being
baptized are spoken of as *renascentes* (e.g. Lett. XVII. 8), those who
have been baptized as *renati* (*passim*), and the rite itself as
*sacramentum regenerationis* (e.g. Lett. IX. 2).

(*magni consilii angelus*) is a translation of the LXX. (which in the

“Counsellor” (*Consiliarius*), two words farther on (which is also the

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p33"></span> A famous passage quoted by Hooker,
Eccl. Pol. v. 53, 2, and Liddon Bampt. Lect., p. 267.  Compare Serm.

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p38"></span> *De prævaricatoris consortio*: 
*prævaricator* originally is a legal term, signifying “a shuffler” in a
suit, an advocate who plays into the hands of the other side.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[40:273](2120038.htm#fr_272.md) <span

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p39"></span> *Pietas*, as in the collect for xvi.
S. aft. Trin., where the English, “pity” represents the Latin “*pietas*”

<span id="fn_274"></span>[40:275](2120038.htm#fr_274.md) <span

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p41"></span> The whole of the end of this chapter

id="ii.iv.xxviii-p43.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p44"></span> *Incomprehensibilis voluit
comprehendi*.  Canon Bright’s references are most apposite:  “compare
Serm. lxviii., *idem est qui impiorum manibus comprehenditur et qui
nullo fine concluditur:*  and Serm. xxxvii. 1, *genetricis gremio
continetur qui nullo fine concluditor*.  This ‘antithesis’ has been
grandly expressed in Milman’s, ‘Martyr of Antioch.’

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p45"></span>“‘And Thou wast laid within the tomb…

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p46"></span>Whom heaven could not contain,

id="ii.iv.xxviii-p49.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p50"></span> This passage (which is repeated in
Serm. liv., chap. 2, down to “injuries”), was objected to by the
Illyrian and Palestinian bishops as savouring of the heresy of Nestorius
who “divided the substance:”  but it is obvious that the same words
might have an orthodox meaning in the mouth of one who was orthodox and
to the unorthodox would bear an unorthodox construction.

id="ii.iv.xxviii-p65.2"></span>πὸ τῆς πρωτοτύπου πέτρας</span>:  others
translate it “from the original (or archetypal) rock,” but it seems
better to link the passage more closely with [Eph.
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md), [1 Pet.
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p65.3"></span>, &c., although the Greek rendering is
against this:  see Serm. iv. chap. 2, where Leo is expounding the same
favourite text.  Bright’s note 64 is most useful in explaining the
Leonine exposition.  “Three elements,” he says, combine in the idea; (1)
Christ Himself; (2) the faith in Christ; and (3) Peter considered as the
chief of the Apostles and under Christ, the head of the Church.”  Hence
*petra* is applied to each of these at different times.

id="ii.iv.xxviii-p71.1"></span>:  the Lat. for “destroys” (or
“dissolves,” Bright) is *solvit* (so also in Lett. CXLIV. 3), which
appears to be an exclusively Western reading:  for Socrates, “the only
Greek authority for <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p71.2"></span>λύει</span>” (the Gk. equivalent),
according to Dr. Westcott, quotes no Gk. <span class="sc"><span

unhesitatingly makes use of that reading.  The Gk. version here however,
gives <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p71.4"></span>διαιρεῖν</span>, which simply begs the
question (in Leo’s favour) as to the original meaning of the phrase
*solvere Jesum*, though on the face of it that is not at all necessarily
obvious.
