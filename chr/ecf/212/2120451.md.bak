<span id="iii.v.iv.xxx"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXIX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxx-p2"></span>To Constantius, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxx-p3"></span>Gregory to Constantius, Bishop of
Mediolanum (*Milan*).

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxx-p4"></span>Having read the letter of your
Holiness, we find that you are in a state of serious distress,
principally on account of the bishops and citizens of Briscia
(*Brescia*) who bid you send them a letter in which you are asked to
swear that you have not condemned the Three Chapters <span
id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563.md) .  Now, if your Fraternity’s
predecessor Laurentius did not do this, it ought not to be required of
you.  But, if he did it, he was not with the universal Church, and
contradicted what he had sworn to in his security <span
id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md) .  But, inasmuch as we believe him
to have kept his oath, and to have continued in the unity of the
Catholic Church, there is no doubt that he did not swear to any of his
bishops that he had not condemned the Three Chapters.  Hence your
Holiness may conclude that you ought not to be forced to do what was in
no <span id="page_160b">p. 160b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iv.xxx-Page_160b"></span>wise done by your predecessor.  But,
lest those who have thus written to you should be offended, send them a
letter declaring under interposition of anathema that you neither take
away anything from the faith of the synod of Chalcedon nor received
those who do, and that you condemn whomsoever it condemned, and absolve
whomsoever it absolved.  And thus I believe that they may be very soon
satisfied <span id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md) .

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxx-p8"></span>Further, as to what you write about
many of them being offended because you name our brother and
fellow-bishop John of the Church of Ravenna during the solemnities of
mass, you should enquire into the ancient custom; and, if it has been
the custom, it ought not now to be found fault with by foolish men. 
But, if it has not been the custom, a thing ought not to be done at
which some may possibly take offence.  Yet I have been at pains to make
careful enquiry whether the same John our brother and fellow-bishop
names you at the altar; and they say that this is not done.  And, if he
does not make mention of your name, I know not what necessity obliges
you to make mention of his.  If indeed it can be done without any one
taking offence, your doing anything of this kind is very laudable, since
you shew the charity you have towards your brethren.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxx-p9"></span>Further, as to what you write of your
having been unwilling to transmit my letter to Queen Theodelinda on the
ground that the fifth synod was named in it, if you believed that she
might thereby be offended, you did right in not transmitting it.  We are
therefore doing now as you recommend, namely, that we should only
express approval of the four synods.  Yet, as to the synod which was
afterwards held in Constantinople, called by many the fifth, I would
have you know that it neither ordained nor held anything in opposition
to the four most holy synods, seeing that nothing was done in it with
respect to the faith, but only with respect to persons; and persons,
too, about whom nothing is contained in the acts of the Council of
Chalcedon <span id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md) but, after the
canons had been promulged, discussion arose, and final action was
ventilated concerning persons.  Yet still we have done as you desired,
making no mention of this synod.  But we have also written to our
daughter the queen what you wrote to us about the bishops.  Ursicinus,
who wrote something to you against our brother and fellow-bishop John,
you ought by your letters addressed to him, with sweetness and reason,
to restrain from his intention.  Further, concerning Fortunatus <span
id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md) , we desire your Fraternity to be
careful, lest you be in any way surreptitiously influenced by bad men. 
For I hear that he ate at the table of the Church with your predecessor
Laurentius for many years until now, that he sat among the nobles, and
subscribed, and that with our brother’s knowledge he served in the
army.  And now, after so many years, your Fraternity thinks that he
should be driven from the position which he now occupies.  This seems to
me altogether incongruous.  And so I have given you this order through
him, but privately.  Still, if there is anything reasonable that can be
alleged against him, it ought to be submitted to our judgment.  But, if
it please Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxx-p11.1"></span>God</span>, we will send letters through
your man to our son the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxx-p11.2"></span>Lord</span> Dynamius.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxx-p6"></span> *Cautionis suæ*, as to the meaning of
which expression, see above, Epistle II., note 2.  It appears certain
from what Gregory says, here and in Epistle II., that Laurentius, the
predecessor of Constantius, had pledged himself by oath to the bishop of
Rome to uphold the condemnation of “The Three Chapters.”  But it seems
that some of his suffragans now asserted that he had sworn to them that
he had not assented to such condemnation, and that on this understanding
they had remained in his communion.  Gregory does not seem certain how
the matter stood:  but he goes on the supposition that he could not have
perjured himself as the bishops alleged.

<span id="fn_1566"></span>[160b:1567](2120451.htm#fr_1566.md) <span
id="iii.v.iv.xxx-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxx-p10"></span> Here Gregory is in error, for in the
eighth, ninth, and tenth sessions of the council of Chalcedon Theodoret
and Ibas, whose writings were anathematized in that fifth council, were
heard in their own defence, and definitely acquitted of heresy.  It is
true that there is no mention of them in the Definition of faith, agreed
upon in the fifth session of Chalcedon, or in the Canons which were
perhaps all that Gregory had before him.  It is true also that there was
no reference at Chalcedon to Theodore of Mopsuestia, who was especially
and personally anathematized at the fifth council, he having died many
years before the council of Chalcedon was held.  But the cases of
Theodoret and Ibas had been prominently before the synod; and this not,
as Gregory here goes on to intimate, in a supplementary sort of way at
the end of the main proceedings:  for the eighth, ninth, and tenth
sessions had been occupied with them, after which there had been other
sessions.  For similar inaccuracy on Gregory’s part in referring to past
events, see II. 51, note 2; and for an instance of his imperfect
acquaintance with the history of past controversies, see VII. 4.
