<span id="ii.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Letter IV.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.iv-p2.1"></span>To the Bishops appointed in Campania, Picenum,
Etruria, and all the Provinces.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p3"></span>Leo, bishop of the city of Rome, to all
the bishops appointed in Campania, Picenum, Etruria, and all the
provinces, greeting in the Lord.

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p4"></span>I.  *Introduction.*

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p5"></span>As the peaceful settlement of the churches
causes us satisfaction, so are we saddened with no slight sorrow
whenever we learn that anything has been taken for granted or done
contrary to the ordinances of the canons and the discipline of the
Church:  and if we do not repress such things with the vigilance we
ought, we cannot excuse ourselves to Him <span id="page_3">p. 3</span>
<span id="ii.iv.iv-Page_3"></span>who intended us to be watchmen <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) , for permitting the pure body of the
Church, which we ought to keep clean from every stain, to be defiled by
contact with wicked schemers, since the framework of the members loses
its harmony by such dissimulation.

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p7"></span>II.  *Slaves and serfs (coloni) are not to
be ordained.*

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p8"></span>Men are admitted commonly to the Sacred
Order who are not qualified by any dignity of birth or character:  even
some who have failed to obtain their liberty from their masters are
raised to the rank of the priesthood <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) , as if sorry slaves were fit for that
honour; and it is believed that a man can be approved of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.iv-p9.1"></span>God</span> who has not yet
been able to approve himself to his master.  And so the cause for
complaint is twofold in this matter, because both the sacred ministry is
polluted by such poor partners in it, and the rights of masters are
infringed so far as unlawful possession is rashly taken of them <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) .  From these men, therefore, beloved
brethren, let all the priests of your province keep aloof; and not only
from them, but from others also, we wish you to keep, who are under the
bond of origin or other condition of service <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) :  unless perchance the request or
consent be intimated of those who claim some authority over them.  For
he who is to be enrolled on the divine service ought to be exempt from
others, that he be not drawn away from the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.iv-p11.1"></span>Lord’s</span> camp in which his name is
entered, by any other bonds of duty.

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p12"></span>III.  *A man who has married twice or a
widow is not eligible as a priest.*

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p13"></span>Again, when each man’s respectability of
birth and conduct has been established, what sort of person should be
associated with the ministry of the Sacred Altar we have learnt both
from the teaching of the Apostle and the Divine precepts and the
regulations of the canons, from which we find very many of the brethren
have turned aside and quite gone out of the way.  For it is well known
that the husbands of widows have attained to the priesthood:  certain,
too, who have had several wives, and have led a life given up to all
licentiousness, have had all facilities put in their way, and been
admitted to the Sacred Order, contrary to that utterance of the blessed
Apostle, in which he proclaims and says to such, “the husband of one
wife <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) ,” and contrary to that
precept of the ancient law which says by way of caution:  “Let the
priest take a virgin to wife, not a widow, not a divorced woman <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) .”  All such persons, therefore, who have
been admitted we order to be put out of their offices in the church and
from the title of priest by the authority of the Apostolic See:  for
they will have no claim <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) to that for
which they were not eligible, on account of the obstacle in question: 
and we specially claim for ourselves the duty of settling this, that if
any of these irregularities have been committed, they may be corrected
and may not be allowed to occur again, and that no excuse may arise from
ignorance:  although it has never been allowed a priest to be ignorant
of what has been laid down by the rules of the canons.  These writings,
therefore, we have addressed to your provinces by the hand of Innocent,
Legitimus and Segetius, our brothers and fellow-bishops:  that the evil
shoots which are known to have sprung up may be torn out by the roots,
and no tares may spoil the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.iv-p16.1"></span>Lord’s</span> harvest.  For thus all that is
genuine will bear much fruit, if that which has been wont to kill the
growing crop be carefully cleared away.

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p17"></span>IV.  *Usurious practices forbidden for
clergy and for laity* <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) .

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p19"></span>This point, too, we have thought must not
be passed over, that certain possessed with the love of base gain lay
out their money at interest, <span id="page_4">p. 4</span> <span
id="ii.iv.iv-Page_4"></span>and wish to enrich themselves as usurers. 
For we are grieved that this is practised not only by those who belong
to the clergy, but also by laymen who desire to be called Christians. 
And we decree that those who have been convicted be punished sharply,
that all occasion of sinning be removed.

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p20"></span>V.  *A cleric may not make money in
another’s name any more than in his own.*

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p21"></span>The following warning, also, we have
thought fit to give, that no cleric should attempt to make money in
another’s name any more than in his own:  for it is unbecoming to shield
one’s crime under another man’s gains <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) .  Nay, we ought to look at and aim at
only that usury whereby what we bestow in mercy here we may recover from
the <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.iv-p22.1"></span>Lord</span>, who
will restore a thousand fold what will last for ever.

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p23"></span>VI.  *Any bishop who refuses consent to
these rules must be deposed.*

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p24"></span>This admonition of ours, therefore,
proclaims that if any of our brethren endeavour to contravene these
rules and dare to do what is forbidden by them, he may know that he is
liable to deposition from his office, and that he will not be a sharer
in our communion who refuses to be a sharer of our discipline.  But lest
there be anything which may possibly be thought to be omitted by us, we
bid you, beloved, to keep all the decretal rules of Innocent of blessed
memory <span id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) , and also of all our
predecessors, which have been promulgated about the orders of the Church
and the discipline of the canons, and to keep them in such wise that if
any have transgressed them he may know at once that all indulgence is
denied him.

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p26"></span>Dated 10th of October, in the consulship
of the illustrious Maximus (a second time) and Paterius (<span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.iv-p26.1"></span>a.d.</span> 443).

<span id="fn_28"></span>[3:29](2120014.htm#fr_28.md) <span
id="ii.iv.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p6"></span> Cf. [Ezek. iii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017.md)<span id="ii.iv.iv-p6.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[3:30](2120014.htm#fr_29.md) <span

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p9"></span> *Sacerdotii*, see note 5 on Letter I.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[3:31](2120014.htm#fr_30.md) <span
id="ii.iv.iv-p9.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p10"></span> Though no doubt S. Leo’s language is
here harsh and offensive to modern ears, it is not, I think,
substantially out of agreement with S. Paul’s own teaching (cf. [Phlm.
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001.md), [1 Cor.
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021.md), [Eph.
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005.md), [Col.
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022.md), [Titus
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009)<span id="ii.iv.iv-p10.1"></span>.md),
and certainly not with the spirit of the age.  The 73rd Apost. Canon
forbids any slave to be ordained without his master’s consent, and
without previously obtaining his freedom.  However, in the times of S.
Jerome, S. Basil and S. Greg. Nazianzen, we find cases of slaves being
ordained.  However much we in the latter half of the nineteenth century
regret to hear a great father of the Church speak in this way we must
not forget that in the first half of this self-same century the very
same opinion would have been held on the subject in many parts of the
civilized world.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[3:32](2120014.htm#fr_31.md) <span
id="ii.iv.iv-p10.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p11"></span> *Qui originali* (*al. origini*) *aut
alicui condicioni obligati sunt*.  The class of people alluded to were
the *coloni* (serfs):  such of them as were so by birth were called
*originarii:*  and there were other classes of them also (*alicui
condicioni obligati*).  The essential difference between all *coloni*
and the ordinary *servi* was that the latter’s service was *personal*,
the former were *servi terræ, adscripti glæbæ*.  Thus there is a strong
resemblance between them and the villeins (*villani*) of medieval and
modern Europe.  For the order concerning them here given, cf. 2nd
Council of Orleans (538), which ordains “*ut nullus servilibus
colonariisque condicionibus obligatus iuxta statuta sedis Apostolicæ ad
honores ecclesiasticos admittatur nisi prius aut testamento aut per
tabulas legitime constiterit absolutum*.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[3:33](2120014.htm#fr_32.md) <span
id="ii.iv.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p14"></span> [1 Tim. iii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md)<span id="ii.iv.iv-p14.1"></span>,
*unius uxoris virum* with the Vulgate, cf. Letter xii. 3.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[3:34](2120014.htm#fr_33.md) <span
id="ii.iv.iv-p14.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p15"></span> [Lev.
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#014.md)<span id="ii.iv.iv-p15.1"></span>,
cf. a letter of Innocent I. to Victricius, bishop of Rothomagus (Rouen)
chap. v., *ut mulierem* (*viduam*) *clericus non ducat uxorem:  quia
scriptum est:  sacerdos virginem uxorem accipiat non eiectam*,” and for
the former quotation, cf. ibid. chap vii. *ne is qui secundam duxerit
uxorem, clericus fiat:  quia scriptum est unius virum*.  The 18th
Apostolic Canon gives a similar order.  All these rules would seem to
refer to marriage before, not after, ordination.  The latter was against
the spirit of the early Church.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[3:35](2120014.htm#fr_34.md) <span
id="ii.iv.iv-p15.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p16"></span> The older editions here add *pro
arbitrio* (by dispensation), which Quesnel considers a gloss added later
when dispensation was sometimes granted to digamous clerks.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[3:36](2120014.htm#fr_35.md) <span
id="ii.iv.iv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p18"></span> The practice of usury and trading
generally is often forbidden in the Canons, &c., for the clergy, but its
prohibition for the laity is much more unusual:  cf., however, Canon V.
of the Council of Carthage (419), *quod* (*sc. fenus accipere)* *in
laicis, reprehenditur id multo magis debet et in clericis prædamnari*. 
Scripture certainly is against the clergy participating in lucrative
employments, though it was not easy always to prevent them:  it had
become, for instance, a common practice in S. Cyprian’s day in the North
African Church (cf. *de laps*. 6).  But the secular laws certainly
countenanced it in the laity (as Aug. Ep. 154<span
id="ii.iv.iv-p18.1"></span> acknowledges).  Leo the Emperor is said by
Grotius to have been the first who “*existimans omne fenus Christiano
interdictum, lege id ipsum communi sanxit*” (Quesnel).

<span id="fn_36"></span>[4:37](2120014.htm#fr_36.md) <span
id="ii.iv.iv-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p22"></span> *Crimen suum commodis alienis
impendere*.  I am not sure that this can mean what I say.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[4:38](2120014.htm#fr_37.md) <span
id="ii.iv.iv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p25"></span> This was S. Innocent I., who was Pope
from 402 to 417.  One of his decretal letters was quoted from in note 1
to chap. iii. of this Letter.
