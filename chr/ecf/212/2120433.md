id="iii.v.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xii-p2"></span>To Januarius, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xii-p3"></span>Gregory to Januarius, Bishop of
Caralis (*Cagliari*).

<span id="iii.v.iv.xii-p4"></span>Theodosia, a religious lady, being
desirous of carrying out the intention of her late husband <span
id="page_150b">p. 150b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iv.xii-Page_150b"></span>Stephen by the building of a
monastery <span id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535.md) , has begged us to
transmit our letters to your Fraternity, whereby, through our
commendation, she may the more readily be counted worthy of your aid. 
She asserts that her husband had given directions for the monastery to
be constructed on the farm called Piscenas, which has come into the
possession of the guest-house (*Xenodochii*) of the late bishop Thomas. 
Now, though the possessor of the property would allow her to found it on
land that is not her own, yet seeing that the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xii-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> with reason objects <span
id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536.md) , we have thought it right to agree
to her petition; which is that she should, with the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xii-p6.1"></span>Lord’s</span> help,
construct a monastery for handmaidens of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xii-p6.2"></span>God</span> in a house belonging to
herself, which she asserts that she has at Caralis.  But, since she says
that the aforesaid house is burdened by guests and visitors, we exhort
thy Fraternity to take pains to assist her in all ways, and lend the aid
of thy protection to her devotion, so that thy assistance and assiduity
may make thee partaker of the reward of her departed husband’s
earnestness and her own.  As to the relics which she requests may be
placed there, we desire that they be deposited with due reverence by thy
Fraternity.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xii-p6"></span> The farm Piscenas appears to have
been held by the tenure called *Emphyteusis*, according to which the
*possessor* of the land (called also *Emphyteuta*) was not its real
owner, though on condition of his cultivating it properly and paying
certain fixed dues to the owner (*dominus*), he had a perpetual right of
possession (*jus in re*), which passed to his heirs, and could be sold
by him to others.  In the latter case, however, the *dominus* had the
option of himself buying up the possessor’s right at the price offered
by the proposed purchaser, and he could object to the transference of
*possessio* to persons unable to maintain the property in good
condition.  In all cases of transference, other than devolution to
heirs, a fiftieth part of the purchase money, or of the value of the
property, was also payable to the *dominus*.  (Article on *Emphyteusis*
in Smith’s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities.)  In the case
before us the lord of the property seems to have refused his consent to
any part of it being alienated in Mortmain to a monastery.  It may be
supposed that the possession of the farm Piscenas had been in Stephen
the testator himself when he directed a monastery to be founded on it,
and that it had passed after his death into other hands.
