<span id="iii.v.v.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxv-p1.1"></span>Epistle LII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xxv-p2"></span>To John, Archbishop.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxv-p3"></span>Gregory to John, Archbishop of the
Corinthians.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxv-p4"></span>The equity and solicitude of Secundinus
our brother and fellow-bishop, which had been well known to us of old,
is shewn also by the tenor of your letters.  In this matter he has
greatly pleased us, and made us glad, in that in the cause of
Anastasius <span id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615.md) , once bishop,
which we charged him to enquire into, he has both exercised his
vigilance diligently and judged the crimes that were discovered as
justice required, and as was right.  But in all these things we return
thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxv-p5.1"></span>God</span> for that, when certain accusers
held back, He brought the truth to his knowledge, lest the originator of
such great crimes should escape detection.  But seeing that, in the
sentence wherein it is evident that the above-named Anastasius has been
justly condemned and deposed, our above-named brother and fellow-bishop
has visited the offence of certain persons in such a manner as to
reserve them for our judgment, we therefore have seen fit to signify by
this present epistle what is to be held to and observed concerning them.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxv-p6"></span>As to Paul the deacon then, the bearer
of these presents, although his fault is exceedingly to his shame and
discredit—namely, that deluded by promises, he held back from accusation
of his late bishop who has been lately deposed, and that, in the
eagerness of cupidity, he consented, against his own soul, to keep
silence rather than declare the truth—yet, since it befits us to be more
kind than strict, we pardon him this fault, and decide that he is to be
received again into his rank and position.  For we believe that the
affliction which he has endured since the time of the sentence being
pronounced may suffice for the punishment of this fault.  But as to
Euphemius and Thomas, who received sacred orders for relinquishing their
accusation, it is our will that they be deprived of these sacred orders,
and, having been deposed from them, so continue; and we decree that they
shall never, under any pretext or excuse, be restored to sacred orders. 
For it is in the highest degree improper, and contrary to the rule of
ecclesiastical discipline, that they should enjoy the dignity which they
have received, not for their merits, but as the reward of wickedness. 
Yet, inasmuch as it is fit for us to incline to mercy more than to
strict justice, it is our will that the same Euphemius and Thomas be
restored to the rank and position, but to that only, from which they had
been promoted to sacred orders, and receive during all the days of their
life the stipends of these positions, as they had been before
accustomed.  Further, as to Clematius the reader, I appoint, from a like
motive of benignity, that he is to be restored <span id="page_182b">p.
182b</span> <span id="iii.v.v.xxv-Page_182b"></span>to his rank and
position.  To all these also, that is, to Paul the deacon, to Euphemius,
Thomas, and Clematius, let your Fraternity take care to supply their
emoluments, according to the rank and position in which each of them is,
as each has been accustomed to receive them, from this present
thirteenth indiction without any diminution.  Inasmuch, therefore, as
the above-named Paul the deacon asserts that he expended much for the
advantage of your Church, and desires to be aided by the succour of your
Fraternity for recovery of the same, we exhort that, if this is so, you
should concur with him in all possible ways, and support him with your
aid, for recovering what he has given, since no reason allows that he
should unjustly suffer loss in what he has expended for the advantage of
the generality.  Furthermore, let your Fraternity restore without delay
the three pounds of gold which, at the instance of our above-named
brother and fellow-bishop Secundinus, it appears that the said Paul the
deacon gave for the benefit of your Church, lest (which <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxv-p6.1"></span>God</span> forbid) you
should seem to burden him, not reasonably, but out of mere caprice.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxv-p5"></span> Anastasius, bishop of the Metropolitan
See of Corinth, had been deposed for some serious crime, the nature of
which is not mentioned, Secundinus, bishop of some other see, having
apparently been commissioned by Gregory to investigate the charges
against him.  John, to whom this letter is addressed had now succeeded
him.  See also Epp. LVII., LVIII.
