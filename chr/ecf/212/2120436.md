id="iii.v.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xv-p2"></span>To Venantius, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xv-p3"></span>Gregory to Venantius, Bishop of Luna
(*in Etruria*).

<span id="iii.v.iv.xv-p4"></span>It has reached us by the report of many
that Christian slaves are detained in servitude by Jews living in the
city of Luna <span id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540) ; which thing
has seemed to us by so much the more offensive as the sufferance of it
by thy Fraternity annoys us.  For it was thy duty, in respect of thy
place, and in thy regard for the Christian religion, to leave no
occasion for simple souls to serve Jewish superstition not through
persuasion, but, in a manner, by right of authority.  Wherefore we
exhort thy Fraternity that, according to the course laid down by the
most pious laws, no Jew be allowed to retain a Christian slave in his
possession.  But, if any are found in their power, let liberty be
secured to them by protection under the sanction of law.  But as to any
that are on the property of Jews, though they be themselves free from
legal obligation, yet, since they have long been attached to the
cultivation of their lands as bound by the condition of their tenure,
let them continue to cultivate the farms they have been accustomed to
do, rendering their payments to the aforesaid persons, and performing
all things that the laws require of husbandmen or natives, except that
no farther burden be imposed on them.  But, whether any one of these
should wish to remain in his servitude, or any to migrate to another
place, let the latter consider with himself that he will have lost his
rights as a husbandman by his own rashness, though he has got rid of his
servitude by force of law.  In all these things, then, we desire thee to
exert thyself so wisely that neither mayest thou be a guilty pastor of a
dismembered flock, nor may thy too little zeal render thee reprehensible
before us.
