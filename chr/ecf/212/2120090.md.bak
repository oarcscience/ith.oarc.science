<span id="ii.iv.lxxx-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.lxxx-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXV.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.lxxx-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.lxxx-p2.1"></span>To Anatolius, Bishop of
Constantinople.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.lxxx-p3"></span>Leo, the bishop, to the bishop
Anatolius.

<span id="ii.iv.lxxx-p4"></span>I.  *Anatolius with Leo’s delegates is
to settle the question of the receiving back of those who had
temporarily gone astray after Eutyches.*

<span id="ii.iv.lxxx-p5"></span>Although I hope, beloved, you are
devoted to every good work, yet that your activity may be rendered the
more effective, it was needful and fitting to despatch my brothers
Lucentius the bishop and Basil the presbyter, as we <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) promised, to ally themselves with you,
beloved, that nothing may be done either indecisively or lazily in
matters, which concern the welfare of the universal Church; for as long
as you are on the spot, to whom we have entrusted the carrying out of
our will, all things can be conducted with such moderation that the
claims of neither kindness nor justice may be neglected, but without the
accepting of persons, the Divine judgment may be considered in
everything.  But that this may be properly observed and guarded, the
integrity of the catholic Faith must first of all be preserved, and,
because in all cases “narrow” and steep “is the way that leadeth unto
life <span id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md) ,” there must be no
deviation from its track, either to the right hand or to the left.  And
because the evangelical and Apostolic Faith has to combat all errors, on
the one side casting down Nestorius, on the other crushing Eutyches and
his accomplices, remember the need of observing this rule, that all
those who in that synod <span id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md) , which
cannot, and does not deserve to have the name of Synod, and in which
Dioscorus displayed his bad feeling, and Juvenal <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) his ignorance, grieve as we learn from
your account, beloved, that they were <span id="page_68">p. 68</span>
<span id="ii.iv.lxxx-Page_68"></span>conquered by fear, and being
overcome with terror, were able to be forced to assent to that
iniquitous judgment, and who now desire to obtain catholic communion,
are to receive the peace of the brethren after due assurance of
repentance, on condition that in no doubtful terms they anathematize,
execrate and condemn Eutyches and his dogma and his adherents.

<span id="ii.iv.lxxx-p10"></span>II.  *The case of the more serious
offenders must be reserved for the present.*

<span id="ii.iv.lxxx-p11"></span>But concerning those who have sinned
more gravely in this matter, and claimed for themselves a higher place
in the same unhappy synod, in order to irritate the simple minds of
their lowlier brethren by their pernicious arrogance, if they return to
their right mind, and ceasing to defend their action, turn themselves to
the condemnation of their particular error, if these men give such
assurance of penitence as shall seem indisputable, let their case be
reserved for the maturer deliberations of the Apostolic See, that when
all things have been sifted and weighed, the right conclusion may be
arrived at about their real actions.  And in the Church over which the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.lxxx-p11.1"></span>Lord</span> has
willed you to rule, let none such as we have already written <span
id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) have their names read at the altar
until the course of events shows what ought to be determined concerning
them.

<span id="ii.iv.lxxx-p13"></span>III.  *Anatolius is requested to
co-operate loyally with Leo’s delegates.*

<span id="ii.iv.lxxx-p14"></span>But concerning the address <span
id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) presented to us by your clergy,
beloved, there is no need to put my sentiments into a letter:  it is
sufficient to entrust all to my delegates, whose words shall carefully
instruct you on every point.  And so, dearest brother, do you endeavour
with these brethren whom we have chosen as suitable agents in so great a
matter faithfully and effectually to carry out what is agreeable to the
Church of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxxx-p15.1"></span>God</span>:  especially as the very nature
of the case, and the promise of Divine aid incite you, and our most
gracious princes show such holy faith, such religious devotion, that we
find in them not only the general sympathy of Christians, but even that
of the priesthood.  Who assuredly in accordance with that piety, whereby
they boast themselves to be servants of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.lxxx-p15.2"></span>God</span>, will receive all your
suggestions for the benefit of the catholic Faith in a worthy spirit, so
that by their aid also the peace of Christendom can be restored and
wicked error destroyed.  And if on any points more advice is needed, let
word be quickly sent to us, that after investigating the nature of the
case, we may carefully prescribe the rightful measures.  Dated 9th of
June in the consulship of the illustrious Adelfius (451).
