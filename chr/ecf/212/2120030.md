<span id="ii.iv.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Letter XX.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xx-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xx-p2.1"></span>To Eutyches, an Abbot of
Constantinople.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xx-p3"></span>Leo, the bishop, to his dearly-beloved
son, Eutyches, presbyter.

<span id="ii.iv.xx-p4"></span>He thanks him for his information about
the revival of Nestorianism and commends his zeal.

<span id="ii.iv.xx-p5"></span>You have brought to our knowledge,
beloved, by your letter that through the activity of some <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211) the heresy of Nestorius has been again
reviving.  We reply that your solicitude in this matter has pleased us,
since the remarks we have received are an indication of your mind. 
Wherefore do not doubt that the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xx-p6.1"></span>Lord</span>, the Founder of the catholic
Faith, will befriend you in all things.  And when we have been able to
ascertain more fully by whose wickedness this happens, we must make
provision with the help of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xx-p6.2"></span>God</span> for the complete uprooting of this
poisonous growth which has long ago been condemned.  <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xx-p6.3"></span>God</span> keep thee safe, my
beloved son.  Dated 1st June, in the consulship of the illustrious
Postumianus and Zeno (448).

<span id="ii.iv.xx-p6"></span> Quesnel is of opinion that Eutyches’
letter had accused Domnus, Bishop of Antioch, and Theodoret, Bishop of
Cyrus (cf. Lett. CXX., chapters iv. and v.), of Nestorianizing, and that
he thus had gained the approbation of Leo before his own unsoundness had
been made known.
