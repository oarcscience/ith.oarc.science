<span id="iii.v.v.xvi-Page_174b"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xvi-p2"></span>To Mauricius Augustus.

<span id="iii.v.v.xvi-p3"></span>Gregory to Mauricius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.v.xvi-p4"></span>The Piety of my Lords, which has been
wont mercifully to sustain your servants, has shone forth here in so
kind a supply that the need of all the feeble has been relieved by the
succour of your bounty.  On this account we all with prayers and tears
beseech Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xvi-p4.1"></span>God</span>, who has moved the heart of your
Clemency to do this thing, that He would preserve the empire of our
Lords safe in His unfailing love, and by the aid of His own majesty
extend their victories in all nations.  The thirty pounds of gold which
my fellow-servant Busa brought, Scribo <span
id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598) has distributed faithfully to
priests, persons in need, and others.  And, since certain females
devoted to a religious life (*sanctimoniales fœminæ*) have come to this
city from divers provinces, having fled hither after captivity, of whom
some, so far as there was room for them, have been placed in
monasteries, but others, who could not be taken in, lead a life of
singular destitution, it has been thought good that what could be spared
from the relief of the blind, maimed and feeble should be distributed to
them, so that not only needy natives, but also strangers who arrive
here, might receive of the compassion of our Lords.  Hence it has been
brought about that all alike with one accord pray for the life of our
lords, that so Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xvi-p5.1"></span>God</span> may give you a long and quiet
life, and grant to the most happy offspring of your Piety to flourish
long in the Roman republic.  The pay also of the soldiers has been so
distributed by my aforesaid fellow-servant Scribo <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599) , in the presence also of the
glorious Castus, *magister militum*, that all received with thanks the
gifts of our lords under due discipline, and abstained from all
murmuring such as was formerly wont to prevail among them.
