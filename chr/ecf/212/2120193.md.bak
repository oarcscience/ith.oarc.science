<span id="ii.v.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p1.1"></span>Sermon XXVII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xv-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p2.1"></span>On the Feast of the Nativity, VII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xv-p3"></span>I.  *It is equally dangerous to deny the
Godhead or the Manhood in Christ.*

<span id="ii.v.xv-p4"></span>He is a true and devout worshipper,
dearly-beloved, of to-day’s festival who thinks nothing that is either
false about the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p4.1"></span>Lord’s</span> Incarnation or unworthy about His
Godhead.  For it is an equally dangerous evil to deny in Him the reality
of our nature and the equality with the Father in glory.  When,
therefore, we attempt to understand the mystery of Christ’s nativity,
wherein He was born of the Virgin-mother, let all the clouds of earthly
reasonings be driven far away and the smoke of worldly wisdom be purged
from the eyes of illuminated faith:  for the authority on which we trust
is divine, the teaching which we follow is divine.  Inasmuch as whether
it be the testimony of the Law, or the oracles of the prophets, or the
trumpet of the gospel to which we apply our inward ear, that is true
which the blessed John full of the Holy Spirit uttered with his voice of
thunder <span id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807.md) :  “in the beginning was
the Word:  and the Word was with <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p5.2"></span>God</span>, and the Word was <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p5.3"></span>God</span>.  The same was in
the beginning with <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p5.4"></span>God</span>.  All things were made through Him,
and without Him was nothing made <span id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808.md)
.”  And similarly is it true what the same preacher added:  “the Word
became flesh and dwelt in us:  and we beheld His glory, the glory as of
the only-begotten of the Father <span id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809.md)
.”  Therefore in both natures it is the same Son of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p7.2"></span>God</span> taking what is ours
and not losing what is His own; renewing man in His manhood, but
enduring unchangeable in Himself.  For the Godhead which is His in
common with the Father underwent no loss of omnipotence, nor did the
“form of a slave” do despite to the “form of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p7.3"></span>God</span>,” because the supreme and eternal
Essence, which lowered Itself for the salvation of mankind, transferred
us into Its glory, but did not cease to be what It was.  And hence when
the Only-begotten of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p7.4"></span>God</span> confesses Himself less than the
Father <span id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810.md) , and yet calls Himself
equal with Him <span id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811.md) , He demonstrates
the reality of both forms in Himself:  so that the inequality proves the
human nature, and the equality the Divine.

<span id="ii.v.xv-p10"></span>II.  *The Incarnation has changed all the
possibilities of man’s existence*.

<span id="ii.v.xv-p11"></span>The bodily Nativity therefore of the Son
of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p11.1"></span>God</span> took
nothing from and added nothing to His Majesty because His unchangeable
substance could be neither diminished nor increased.  For that “the Word
became flesh” does not signify that the nature of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p11.2"></span>God</span> was changed into flesh, but that
the Word took the flesh into the unity of His Person:  and therein
undoubtedly the whole man was received, with which within the Virgin’s
womb fecundated by the Holy Spirit, whose virginity was destined never
to be lost <span id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812.md) , the Son of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p12.1"></span>God</span> was so inseparably
united that He who was born without time of the Father’s essence was
Himself in time born of the Virgin’s womb.  For we could not otherwise
be released from the chains of eternal death but by Him becoming humble
in our nature, Who remained Almighty in His own.  And so our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p12.2"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ,
being at birth true man though He never ceased to be true <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p12.3"></span>God</span>, made in Himself
the beginning of a new creation, <span id="page_140">p. 140</span> <span
id="ii.v.xv-Page_140"></span>and in the “form” of His birth started the
spiritual life of mankind afresh, that to abolish the taint of our birth
according to the flesh there might be a possibility of regeneration
without our sinful seed for those of whom it is said, “Who were born not
of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p12.4"></span>God <span
id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813.md) </span>.”  What mind can grasp this
mystery, what tongue can express this gracious act?  Sinfulness returns
to guiltlessness and the old nature becomes new; strangers receive
adoption and outsiders enter upon an inheritance.  The ungodly begin to
be righteous, the miserly benevolent, the incontinent chaste, the
earthly heavenly.  And whence comes this change, save by the right hand
of the Most High?  For the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p13.2"></span>God</span> came to “destroy the works of the
devil <span id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814.md) ,” and has so united
Himself with us and us with Him that the descent of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p14.2"></span>God</span> to man’s estate
became the exaltation of man to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p14.3"></span>God’s</span>.

<span id="ii.v.xv-p15"></span>III.  *The Devil knows exactly what
temptations to offer to each several person.*

<span id="ii.v.xv-p16"></span>But in this mercifulness of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p16.1"></span>God</span>, dearly beloved,
the greatness of which towards us we cannot explain, Christians must be
extremely careful lest they be caught again in the devil’s wiles and
once more entangled in the errors which they have renounced.  For the
old enemy does not cease to “transform himself into an angel of
light <span id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815.md) ,” and spread everywhere
the snares of his deceptions, and make every effort to corrupt the faith
of believers.  He knows whom to ply with the zest of greed, whom to
assail with the allurements of the belly, before whom to set the
attractions of self-indulgence, in whom to instil the poison of
jealousy:  he knows whom to overwhelm with grief, whom to cheat with
joy, whom to surprise with fear, whom to bewilder with wonderment: 
there is no one whose habits he does not sift, whose cares he does not
winnow, whose affections he does not pry into:  and wherever he sees a
man most absorbed in occupation, there he seeks opportunity to injure
him.  Moreover he has many whom he has bound still more tightly because
they are suited for his designs, that he may use their abilities and
tongues to deceive others.  Through them are guaranteed the healing of
sicknesses, the prognosticating of future events, the appeasing of
demons and the driving away of apparitions <span
id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816.md) .  They also are to be added <span
id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817.md) who falsely allege that the entire
condition of human life depends on the influences of the stars, and that
that which is really either the divine will or ours rests with the
unchangeable fates.  And yet, in order to do still greater harm, they
promise that they can be changed if supplication is made to those
constellations which are adverse.  And thus their ungodly fabrications
destroy themselves; for if their predictions are not reliable, the fates
are not to be feared:  if they are, the stars are not to be venerated.

<span id="ii.v.xv-p20"></span>IV.  *The foolish practice of some who
turn to the sun and bow to it is reprehensible.*

<span id="ii.v.xv-p21"></span>From such a system of teaching proceeds
also the ungodly practice of certain foolish folk who worship the sun as
it rises at the beginning of daylight from elevated positions:  even
some Christians think it is so proper to do this that, before entering
the blessed Apostle Peter’s basilica, which is dedicated to the One
Living and true <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p21.1"></span>God</span>, when they have mounted the steps
which lead to the raised platform <span
id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md) , they turn round and bow themselves
towards the rising sun and with bent neck do homage to its brilliant
orb.  We are full of grief and vexation that this should happen, which
is partly due to the fault of ignorance and partly to the spirit of
heathenism:  because although some of them do perhaps worship the
Creator of that fair light rather than the Light itself, which is His
creature, yet we must abstain even from the appearance of this
observance:  for if one who has abandoned the worship of gods, finds it
in our own worship, will he not hark back again to this fragment of his
old superstition, as if it were allowable, when he sees it to be common
both to Christians and to infidels?

<span id="ii.v.xv-p23"></span>V.  *The sun and moon were created for
use, not for worship.*

<span id="ii.v.xv-p24"></span>This objectionable practice must be given
up therefore by the faithful, and the honour due to <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p24.1"></span>God</span> alone must not be
mixed up with those men’s rites who serve their fellow-creatures.  For
the divine Scripture says:  “Thou shalt worship the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p24.2"></span>Lord</span> thy <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p24.3"></span>God</span>, and Him only
shalt thou serve <span id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md) .”  And the
blessed Job, “a man without complaint,” as the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p25.2"></span>Lord</span> <span id="page_141">p. 141</span>
<span id="ii.v.xv-Page_141"></span>says, “and one that eschews every
evil <span id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md) ,” said, “Have I seen the
sun when it shone or the moon walking brightly, and my heart hath
rejoiced in secret, and I have kissed my hand:  what is my great
iniquity and denial against the most High <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p26.2"></span>God <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md)
</span>?”  But what is the sun or what is the moon but elements of
visible creation and material light:  one of which is of greater
brightness and the other of lesser light?  For as it is now day time and
now night time, so the Creator has constituted divers kinds of
luminaries, although even before they were made there had been days
without the sun and nights without the moon <span
id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md) .  But these were fashioned to serve
in making man, that he who is an animal endowed with reason might be
sure of the distinction of the months, the recurrence of the year, and
the variety of the seasons, since through the unequal length of the
various periods, and the clear indications given by the changes in its
risings, the sun closes the year and the moon renews the months.  For on
the fourth day, as we read, <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p28.2"></span>God</span> said:  “Let there be lights in the
firmament of the heaven, and let them shine upon the earth, and let them
divide between day and night, and let them be for signs and for seasons,
and for days and years, and let them be in the firmament of heaven that
they may shine upon earth.”

<span id="ii.v.xv-p29"></span>VI.  *Let us awake to the proper use of
all our parts and facilities.*

<span id="ii.v.xv-p30"></span>Awake, O man, and recognize the dignity of
thy nature.  Recollect thou wast made in the image of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p30.1"></span>God</span>, which although it
was corrupted in Adam, was yet re-fashioned in Christ.  Use visible
creatures as they should be used, as thou usest earth, sea, sky, air,
springs, and rivers:  and whatever in them is fair and wondrous, ascribe
to the praise and glory of the Maker.  Be not subject to that light
wherein birds and serpents, beasts and cattle, flies and worms delight. 
Confine the material light to your bodily senses, and with all your
mental powers embrace that “true light which lighteth every man that
cometh into this world <span id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md) ,” and of
which the prophet says, “Come unto Him and be enlightened, and your
faces shall not blush <span id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md) .”  For if
we “are a temple of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p32.2"></span>God</span>, and the Spirit of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p32.3"></span>God</span> dwelleth in <span
id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md) ” us, what every one of the faithful
has in his own heart is more than what he wonders at in heaven.  And so,
dearly beloved, we do not bid or advise you to despise <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p33.2"></span>God’s</span> works or to
think there is anything opposed to your Faith in what the good <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p33.3"></span>God</span> has made good, but
to use every kind of creature and the whole furniture of this world
reasonably and moderately:  for as the Apostle says, “the things which
are seen are temporal:  but the things which are not seen are
eternal <span id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md) .”  Hence because we are
born for the present and reborn for the future, let us not give
ourselves up to temporal goods, but to eternal:  and in order that we
may behold our hope nearer, let us think on what the Divine Grace has
bestowed on our nature on the very occasion when we celebrate the
mystery of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xv-p34.2"></span>Lord’s</span> birthday.  Let us hear the
Apostle, saying:  “for ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p34.3"></span>God</span>.  But when
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xv-p34.4"></span>Christ</span>, who is
your life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in
glory <span id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md) :”  who lives and reigns
with the Father and the Holy Ghost for ever and ever.  Amen.

opinions are put down to the Spanish Priscillianists, though doubtless

many of their false views.

reading was *aræ*:  some of the <span class="sc"><span

doubt midway between the two.  A learned dissertation on this passage by
Ciampini quoted by Quesnel (Migne’s Patrol. i. pp. 529–534), established
the true reading:  he says also that this was the staircase up which the
faithful climbed on bended knee in approaching the Vatican *basilica*. 
S. Leo has alluded to this curious practice already in Serm. XXII. chap.
6, *supra*.  It is perhaps hardly necessary to add that this
superstition has little, if any, connexion with the Christian habit of
turning to the East, which is probably rather to the Altar as the centre
of worship; for at all events in Western Christendom churches do not by
any means universally ‘orientate’ (i.e. lie due east and west).
