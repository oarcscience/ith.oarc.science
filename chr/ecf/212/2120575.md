<span id="iii.v.viii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.xiv-p2"></span>*To Rusticiana, Patrician* <span
id="fr_1744"></span>[1745](#fn_1744) .

<span id="iii.v.viii.xiv-p4"></span>Gregory to Rusticiana, &c.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xiv-p5"></span>I remember having before now written
to your Excellency, and repeatedly urged you to lose no time in
revisiting the thresholds of the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles. 
And what means your so great delight in the city of Constantinople, and
your oblivion of the city of Rome, I know not.  I have not so far been
thought worthy of getting any information from you on this head.  For
how far it might be of advantage to your soul for reaping the rewards of
eternal life, and how far it would suit also in all respects your
glorious daughter, the lady Eusebia, this we fully give our attention
to, and you may no less fully consider.  But, if you enquire of my son
Peter, your servant, whom I have found to be wise beyond his age and to
be studying to attain ripeness, you will find how great is the love
towards your Excellency of all who dwell here, and how great their
desire to be thought worthy of seeing you again.  And if, the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.viii.xiv-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> teaching
us, we are admonished in Holy Writ that we should love even our enemies,
we ought to consider how wrong it is to shew no love even to those who
<span id="page_238b">p. 238b</span> <span
id="iii.v.viii.xiv-Page_238b"></span>love us.  But, if haply we are said
to be loved, we know most certainly that no one can have affection for
those whom he does not wish to see.  If, however, you are afraid of the
swords and wars of Italy, you should attentively observe how great is
the protection of the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, in this
city, wherein, without a large force of people, and without military
aid, we are preserved under <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xiv-p5.2"></span>God</span> for so many years among
swords.  This we say, because we love.  But may Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.viii.xiv-p5.3"></span>God</span> grant
whatever He sees to be of advantage to your soul for ever, and to the
renown of your house at the present time.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xiv-p6"></span>The ten pounds of gold which your
Excellency has sent for the redemption of captives I have received at
the hands of my aforesaid son.  But I pray that the heavenly grace which
granted to you that you should give them for your soul’s reward may also
grant to me to dispense them without any contagion of sin; lest we
should be stained by that whereby you wipe away sins.  May Almighty
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.viii.xiv-p6.1"></span>God</span>, who
looks upon the weakness of your body and your pilgrimage, comfort you
ever by His grace, and by the life and health of my most sweet son the
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.viii.xiv-p6.2"></span>Lord</span>
Strategius <span id="fr_1745"></span>[1746](#fn_1745) ; that so He may
nurture him both for you through many years and for Himself through
eternity, and may both replenish you and all your house with present
good and grant you to have grace from above.  We further beg that the
glorious lord Eudoxius may be greeted in our behalf.
