<span id="iii.v.iv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xviii-p2"></span>To the Nobles and Proprietors in
Sardinia.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xviii-p3"></span>Gregory to the Nobles, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xviii-p4"></span>I have learnt from the report of my
brother and fellow-bishop Felix, and my son the servant of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xviii-p4.1"></span>God</span>,
Cyriacus <span id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md) , that nearly all of
you have peasants (*rusticos* <span id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546.md)
) on your estates given to idolatry.  And this has made me very sorry,
since I know that the guilt of subjects weighs down the life of their
superiors, and that, when sin in a subject is not corrected, sentence is
flung back on those who are over them.  Wherefore, magnificent sons, I
exhort that with all care and all solicitude ye be zealous for your
souls, and see what account you will render to Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xviii-p6.1"></span>God</span> for your
subjects.  For indeed they have been committed to you for this end, that
both they may serve for your advantage in earthly things, and you,
through your care for them, may provide for their souls in the things
that are eternal.  If, then, they pay what they owe you, why pay you not
them what you owe them?  That is to say, your Greatness should
assiduously admonish them, and restrain them from the error of idolatry,
to the end that by their being drawn to the faith you may make Almighty
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xviii-p6.2"></span>God</span>
propitious to yourselves.  For, lo, you observe how the end of this
world is close at hand; you see that now a human, now a divine, sword
rages against us:  and yet you, the worshippers of the true <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xviii-p6.3"></span>God</span>, behold
stones adored by those who are committed to you, and are silent <span
id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547.md) .  What, I pray you, will you say
in the tremendous judgment, when you have received <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xviii-p7.1"></span>God’s</span> enemies
into your power, and yet disdain to subdue them to <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xviii-p7.2"></span>God</span> and recall
them to Him?  Wherefore, addressing you with due greeting, I beg that
your Greatness would be earnestly on the watch to give yourselves to
zeal for <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xviii-p7.3"></span>God</span>, and hasten to inform me in
your letters which of you has brought how many to Christ.  If, then,
haply from any cause you are unable to do this, enjoin it on our
aforesaid brother and fellow-bishop Felix, or my son Cyriacus, and
afford them succour for the work of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xviii-p7.4"></span>God</span>, that so in the retribution
to come you may be in a state to partake of life by so much the more as
you now afford succour to a good work.
