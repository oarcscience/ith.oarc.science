<span id="iii.v.viii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.xv-p2"></span>*To Fantinus, Guardian (Defensorem).*

<span id="iii.v.viii.xv-p3"></span>Gregory to Fantinus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xv-p4"></span>From the information of the lady
abbess of the monastery of Saint Stephen in the territory of Agrigentum
we find that many of the Jews, divine grace inspiring them, wish to be
converted to the Christian faith; but that it is necessary for some one
to go thither by our command.  Accordingly we enjoin thee, in virtue of
the authority hereby given thee, that, putting aside every excuse, thou
make haste to go to the aforesaid place, and with the favour of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.viii.xv-p4.1"></span>God</span> aid their
desire by thy exhortations.  If, however, it seems long and dreary for
them to look forward to the Paschal solemnity, and thou findest them
anxious for baptism now, then lest long delay should possibly change
their minds (which <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xv-p4.2"></span>God</span> forbid), speak thou with our
brother the bishop of that place, that, penitence and abstinence having
been prescribed them for forty days, he may baptize them under the
protection of the mercy of Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xv-p4.3"></span>God</span> on a <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xv-p4.4"></span>Lord’s</span> day, or on any very noted
festival that may chance to occur; since the character of the present
time too, on account of impending calamity, impels us not to defer the
fulfilment of their desires by any procrastination.  Further, whomsoever
of them thou ascertainest to be poor and without sufficient means for
buying vestments for themselves, we desire thee to supply with vestments
for their baptism; and know that the price that thou mayest give for
them is to be charged in thy accounts.  But, if they should choose to
wait for the holy season of Easter, speak again with the bishop, that
they may for the present become catechumens, and that he may go to them
frequently, and pay careful attention to them, and kindle their minds by
the admonition of his exhortations, so that the more distant the
expected festival is, the more may they prepare themselves and with
fervent desire look forward to it.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xv-p5"></span>Furthermore, let it be thy care to
enquire with all zeal and diligence whether the above-named monastery
over which the aforesaid lady presides has sufficient means, or whether
it suffers any need.  And whatever thou mayest truly ascertain, as well
as what is done with respect to those who desire to be baptized, make
haste to inform us in full.  The Month of June, first Indiction.
