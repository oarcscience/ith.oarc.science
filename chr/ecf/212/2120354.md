<span id="iii.v.i.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.lii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXXX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.lii-p2"></span>To the Clergy and Nobles of Corsica.

<span id="iii.v.i.lii-p3"></span>Gregory to the Clergy, &c…*A
paribus* <span id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392) .

<span id="iii.v.i.lii-p5"></span>Although for a long time it has caused
you no sorrow that the Church of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.lii-p5.1"></span>God</span> should be without a pontiff, yet
as for us, we are both compelled by the charge of the office we bear and
bound especially by the charity of our love for you, to take thought for
its government, knowing that in its supervision lies at the same time
advantage to your souls.  For, if the care of a shepherd be wanting to a
flock, it easily falls into the snares of the lier in wait. 
Accordingly, inasmuch as the church of Saona has long been deprived of
the aid of a priest, we have held it necessary to constitute Martinus,
our brother and fellow-bishop, cardinal priest of the same <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393) , but to enjoin on Leo our brother
and fellow-bishop the work of its visitation.  To the latter we have
also granted licence to ordain presbyters and deacons in it and in its
parishes, and have permitted him to make use of its property so long as
be shall be there, as though he were its proper pontiff.  And so we
admonish you by these present writings that your Charity receive the
aforesaid visitor with all devotion, and shew him obedience in whatever
is reasonable, as becomes sons of the Church, to the end that, supported
by your devotion, he may be able to accomplish all that is found to
conduce to the advantage of the above-named church.
