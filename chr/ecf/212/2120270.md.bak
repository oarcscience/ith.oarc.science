<span id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p2"></span>How the simple and the crafty are to
be admonished.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p3"></span>(*Admonition* 12.)  Differently to be
admonished are the simple and the insincere.  The simple are to be
praised for studying never to say what is false, but to be admonished to
know how sometimes to be silent about what is true.  For, as falsehood
has always harmed him that speaks it, so sometimes the hearing of truth
has done harm to some.  Wherefore the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p3.1"></span>Lord</span> before His disciples,
tempering His speech with silence, says, *I have many things to say unto
you, but ye cannot bear them now* ([Joh. xvi.
12](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p3.2"></span>).  The simple are therefore to be
admonished that, as they always avoid deceit advantageously, so they
should always utter truth advantageously.  They are to be admonished to
add prudence to the goodness of simplicity, to the end that they may so
possess the security of simplicity as not to lose the circumspection of
prudence.  For hence it is said by the teacher of the Gentiles, *I would
have you wise in that which is good, but simple concerning evil* ([Rom.
xvi. 19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p3.3"></span>).  Hence the Truth in person admonishes
His elect, saying, *Be ye wise as serpents, but simple as doves*
([Matth. x. 16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p3.4"></span>); because, to wit, in the hearts of the
elect the wisdom of the serpent ought to sharpen the simplicity of the
dove and the simplicity of the dove temper the wisdom of the serpent, to
the end that neither through prudence they be seduced into cunning, nor
from simplicity grow torpid in the exercise of the understanding.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p4"></span>But, on the other hand, the insincere
are to be admonished to learn how heavy is the labour of duplicity,
which with guilt they endure.  For, while they are afraid of being found
out, they are ever seeking dishonest defences, they are agitated by
fearful suspicions.  But there is nothing safer for defence than
sincerity, nothing easier to say than truth.  For, when obliged to
defend its deceit, the heart is wearied with hard labour.  For hence it
is written, *The labour of their own lips shall cover them* ([Ps.
cxxxix. 10](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p4.1"></span>).  For what now fills them then covers
them, since it then presses down with sharp retribution him whose soul
it now elevates with a mild disquietude.  Hence it is said through
Jeremiah, *They have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary
themselves to commit iniquity* ([Jerem. ix.
5](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p4.2"></span>):  as if it were said plainly, They who
might have been friends of truth without labour, labour to sin; and,
while they refuse to live in simplicity, by labours require that they
should die.  For commonly, when taken in a fault, while they shrink from
being known to be such as they are, they hide themselves under a veil of
deceit, and endeavour to excuse their sin, which is already plainly
perceived; so that often one who has a care to reprove their faults, led
astray by the mists of the falsehood that surrounds them, finds himself
to have almost lost what he just now held as certain concerning them. 
Hence it is rightly said through the prophet, under the similitude of
Judah, to the soul that sins and excuses itself, *There the urchin had
her nest* ([Isa. 1:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000.md), [Isa.
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p4.3"></span>).  For by the name of urchin is denoted
the duplicity of a mind that is insincere, and cunningly defends itself;
because, to wit, when an urchin is caught, its head is perceived, and
its feet appear, and its whole body is exposed to view; but no sooner
has it been caught than it gathers itself into a ball, draws in its
feet, hides its head, and all is lost together within the hands of him
that holds it which before was all visible together.  So assuredly, so
insincere minds are, when they are seized hold of in their
transgressions.  For the head of the urchin is perceived, because it
appears from what beginning the sinner has advanced to his crime; the
feet of the urchin are seen, because it is discovered by what steps the
iniquity has been perpetrated; and yet by suddenly adducing excuses the
insincere mind gathers in its feet, in that it hides all traces of its
iniquity; it draws in the head, because by strange defences it makes out
that it has not even begun any evil; and it remains as it were a ball in
the hand of one that holds it, because one that takes it to task,
suddenly losing all that he had just now come to the knowledge of, holds
the sinner rolled up within his own consciousness, and, though he had
seen the whole of him when he was caught, yet, illuded by the
tergiversation of dishonest defence, he is in like measure ignorant of
the whole of him.  Thus the urchin has her nest in the reprobate,
because the duplicity of a crafty mind, gathering itself up within
itself, hides itself in the darkness of its self-defence.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p5"></span>Let the insincere hear what is
written, *He that walketh in simplicity walketh surely* ([Prov. x.
9](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p5.1"></span>).  For indeed simplicity of conduct is
an assurance of great security.  Let them hear what is said by the mouth
of the wise man, *The holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit*
([Wisd. i. 5](../../../bib/apo/wis001.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p5.2"></span>).  Let them hear what is again affirmed
by the witness of Scripture, *His communing is with the simple* ([Prov.
iii. 32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p5.3"></span>).  For <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p5.4"></span>God’s</span> communing is His revealing
of secrets to human minds by the illumination of His presence.  He is
therefore said to commune <span id="page_34b">p. 34b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-Page_34b"></span>with the simple, because He
illuminates with the ray of His visitation concerning supernal mysteries
the minds of those whom no shade of duplicity obscures.  But it is a
special evil of the double-minded, that, while they deceive others by
their crooked and double conduct, they glory as though they were
surpassingly prudent beyond others; and, since they consider not the
strictness of retribution, they exult, miserable men that they are, in
their own losses.  But let them hear how the prophet Zephaniah holds out
over them the power of divine rebuke, saying, *Behold the day of the
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p5.5"></span>Lord</span>
cometh, great and horrible, the day of wrath, that day; a day of
darkness and gloominess, a day of cloud and whirlwind, a day of trumpet
and clangour, upon all fenced cities, and upon all lofty corners* (<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p5.6"></span>Zephan. i. 15, 16).  For what is
expressed by fenced cities but minds suspected, and surrounded ever with
a fallacious defence; minds which, as often as their fault is attacked,
suffer not the darts of truth to reach them?  And what is signified by
lofty corners (a wall being always double in corners) but insincere
hearts; which, while they shun the simplicity of truth, are in a manner
doubled back upon themselves in the crookedness of duplicity, and, what
is worse, from their very fault of insincerity lift themselves in their
thoughts with the pride of prudence?  Therefore the day of the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p5.7"></span>Lord</span> comes full
of vengeance and rebuke upon fenced cities and upon lofty corners,
because the wrath of the last judgment both destroys human hearts that
have been closed by defences against the truth, and unfolds such as have
been folded up in duplicities.  For then the fenced cities fall, because
souls which <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xii-p5.8"></span>God</span> has not penetrated will be
damned.  Then the lofty corners tumble, because hearts which erect
themselves in the prudence of insincerity are prostrated by the sentence
of righteousness.
