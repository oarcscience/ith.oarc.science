</span></p>  
<p class="c26"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p3"></A><span class="c4"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p3.1"></A>To Leo Augustus.</span></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p4"></A>Leo, the bishop, to Leo Augustus.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p5"></A>I.&#160; <i>He sends envoys but deprecates any fresh discussion of the Faith.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p6"></A>Rejoicing that it has been proved to me by   <A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.clviii-Page_106"></A>many clear proofs with what earnestness you consult the interests of the universal Church, I have not delayed to obey your Majesty&#146;s commands on the first opportunity, by despatching Domitian and Geminian my brothers and fellow-bishops, who in furtherance of my earnest prayers, shall entreat you for the peaceful acceptance of the gospel-teaching and obtain the liberty of the Faith in which through the instruction of the Holy Spirit you yourself are so conspicuously eminent, now that the enemies of Christ are driven far away, who even if they had wished to conceal their madness, could not lie hid, because the holy simplicity of the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p6.1"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> flock is very different from the pretences of beasts who hide themselves in sheeps&#146; clothing, nor can they creep in by hypocrisy now that their exceeding madness has revealed them.&#160; Recognize, therefore, august and venerable Emperor, how that you are called by Divine providence to the guardianship of the whole world, and understand what aid you owe to your Mother, the Church, who makes especial boast of you.&#160; Disputes that are ended must not be allowed to rise with renewed vigour against the triumphs of the Almighty&#146;s right hand, especially when this can in no wise be allowed to heretics, whose attempts have long ago been condemned and the labours of the faithful have a just claim to this result, that all the fulness of the Church shall remain secure in the completeness of her unity, and that nothing whatever of what has been well laid down shall be reconsidered, because, after constitutions have been legitimately framed under Divine guidance, to wish still to wrangle is the sign not of a peace-making but of a rebellious spirit, as says the Apostle, &#8220;for to strive with words is profitable for nothing, but for the subverting of them that hear&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_605"></A><A HREF="#fn_605"><FONT SIZE="1">606</FONT></A>
.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p8"></A>II.&#160; <i>In matters of Faith human rhetoric is out of place.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p9"></A>For if it be always free for human fancies to assert themselves in dispute, there never will be wanting men who will dare to oppose the Truth, and to put their trust in the glib utterances of this world&#146;s wisdom, whereas the Christian Faith and wisdom knows from the teaching of our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p9.1"></A>Lord</span> Jesus Christ Himself how strictly it ought to shun this most harmful vanity.&#160; For when Christ was about to summon all nations to the illumination of the Faith, He chose those who were to devote themselves to the preaching of the Gospel not from among philosophers or orators, but took humble fishermen as the instruments by which He would reveal Himself, lest the heavenly teaching, which was of itself full of mighty power, should seem to need the aid of words.&#160; And hence the Apostle protests and says, &#8220;For Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the Gospel, not in wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ should be made void; for the word of the cross is to them indeed that perish foolishness, but to those which are being saved it is the power of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p9.2"></A>God</span>.&#160; For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the prudence of the prudent will I reject.&#160; Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the inquirer of this age? has not <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p9.3"></A>God</span> made foolish the wisdom of this world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_606"></A><A HREF="#fn_606"><FONT SIZE="1">607</FONT></A>
?&#8221;&#160; For rhetorical arguments and clever debates of man&#146;s device make their chief boast in this, that in doubtful matters which are obscured by the variety of opinions they can induce their hearers to accept that view which each has chosen for his own genius and eloquence to bring forward; and thus it happens that what is maintained with the greatest eloquence is reckoned the truest.&#160; But Christ&#146;s Gospel needs not this art; for in it the true teaching stands revealed by its own light:&#160; nor is there any seeking for that which shall please the ear, when to know Who is the Teacher is sufficient for true faith.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p11"></A>III.&#160; <i>Eutyches&#146; dogma is condemned by the testimony of Scripture and cannot further be entertained.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p12"></A>But nothing severs those who are deceived by their own inventions, from the light of the Gospel so much as their not thinking that the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p12.1"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> Incarnation appertains in a true sense to man&#146;s, that is, our, nature:&#160; as if it were unworthy of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p12.2"></A>God&#146;s</span> glory that the majesty of the impassible Word should have taken the reality of human flesh, whereas men&#146;s salvation could not otherwise have been restored had not He Who is in the form of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p12.3"></A>God</span> deigned also to take the form of a slave.&#160; And hence since the holy Synod of Chalcedon, which was attended by all the provinces of the Roman world and obtained universal acceptance for its decisions, and is in complete harmony therein with the most sacred council of Nic&aelig;a, has cut off all the wicked followers of the Eutychian dogma from the body of the catholic communion, how shall any of the lapsed regain the peace of the church, without purging himself by a full course of penitence?&#160; For what licence can be granted them for discussing, when they have deserved to be condemned by a just and holy  <A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.clviii-Page_107"></A>judgment, so that they might most truly fall under that sentence of the blessed Apostle, wherewith at the very outset of the infant Church he overthrew the enemies of Christ&#146;s cross, saying:&#160; &#8220;every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ to have come in the flesh is of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p12.4"></A>God</span>, and every spirit which dissolves Jesus is not of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p12.5"></A>God</span>, but this is antichrist&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_607"></A><A HREF="#fn_607"><FONT SIZE="1">608</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; And this pre-existent teaching of the Holy Ghost we must faithfully and stedfastly make use of, lest, by admitting the discussions of such men the authority of the divinely inspired decrees be diminished, when in all parts of your kingdom and in all borders of the earth that Faith which was confirmed at Chalcedon is being established on the surest basis of peace, nor is any one worthy of the name of Christian who cuts himself off from communion with us.&#160; Of whom the Apostle says, &#8220;a man that is heretical after a first and a second admonition, avoid, knowing that such a one is perverse and condemned by his own judgment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_608"></A><A HREF="#fn_608"><FONT SIZE="1">609</FONT></A>
.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p15"></A>IV.&#160; <i>If the Divine mercy is to be exercised, the heretics must cease entirely from the error of their ways.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p16"></A>What therefore the unholy parricide has perpetrated by seizing on the holy Church and cruelly murdering its very ruler, cannot be expiated by man&#146;s forgiveness, unless He Who alone can rightly punish such things, and alone can of His unspeakable mercy remit them, be propitiated.&#160; But though we are not anxious for vengeance, we cannot in any way be allied with the devil&#146;s servants.&#160; Yet if we learn they are quitting the ranks of heresy, repenting them of their error and turning from the weapons of discord to the lamentations of sorrow, we also can intercede for them, lest they perish for ever, thus following the example of the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p16.1"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> loving-kindness, who, when nailed to the wood of the cross prayed for His persecutors, &#8220;Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_609"></A><A HREF="#fn_609"><FONT SIZE="1">610</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; And that Christian love may do this profitably for its enemies, wicked heretics must cease to harass <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p17.2"></A>God&#146;s</span> ever religious and ever devout Church; they must not dare to disturb the souls of the simple by their falsehoods, to the end that, where in all former times the purest faith has flourished, the teaching of the Gospel and of the Apostles may now also have free course; because we also imitating, so far as we can, the Divine mercy desire no one to be punished by justice, but all to be released by mercy.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p18"></A>V.&#160; <i>Let him restore the refugee clergy and laity and utterly reject those who persist in heresy.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p19"></A>I entreat your clemency, listen to the suggestions of my brethren already mentioned, whom, as I some time ago have said in a former letter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_610"></A><A HREF="#fn_610"><FONT SIZE="1">611</FONT></A>
, I have sent not to wrangle with the condemned, but merely to intercede with you for the stability of the catholic Faith.&#160; And in accordance with your faith in and regard for the Divine Majesty this especially you should grant, that completely setting aside the contentions of heretics you should deign to bestow a merciful attention on those who have fallen upon such evil days, and, after restoring the liberty of the church of Alexandria to its pristine state, should set up there a bishop who, upholding the decrees of the Synod of Chalcedon and agreeing with the ordinances of the Gospel, shall be able to restore peace among that greatly disturbed people.&#160; Those bishops and clergy also whom the unholy parricide has driven out of their churches, should be recalled at your Majesty&#146;s command, all others also, whom a like maliciousness has banished from their dwellings, being restored to their former estate, to the end that we may have due cause fully and perfectly to rejoice in the grace of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p20.1"></A>God</span> and your faith without any further noise of strife.&#160; For if any one is so forgetful of the Christian hope and his own salvation as to venture by any dispute to assail the Evangelical and Apostolical decrees of the holy Synod of Chalcedon, thus overthrowing the most sacred Council of Nic&aelig;a also, him with all heretics who have held blasphemous and abominable views on the Incarnation of our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.clviii-p20.2"></A>Lord</span> Jesus Christ we condemn by a like anathema and equal curse, so that, without refusing the remedy of repentance to those who make full and legitimate atonement, the sentence of the Synod, which is based on truth, may rest upon those who still resist.&#160; Dated 17th of August, in the consulship of Leo and Majorian Augusti (458).</p>
