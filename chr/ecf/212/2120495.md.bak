<span id="iii.v.vi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Epistle XII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.ix-p2"></span>To Montana and Thomas.

<span id="iii.v.vi.ix-p3"></span>Gregory to Montana, &c.

<span id="iii.v.vi.ix-p4"></span>Since our Redeemer, the Maker of every
creature, vouchsafed to assume human flesh for this end, that, the chain
of slavery wherewith we were held being broken by the grace of His
Divinity, He might restore us to pristine liberty, it is a salutary deed
if men whom nature originally produced free, and whom the law of nations
has subjected to the yoke of slavery, be restored by the benefit of
manumission to the liberty in which they were born.  And so, moved by
loving-kindness and by consideration of this case, we make you, Montana
and Thomas, servants of the holy Roman Church which with the help of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.ix-p4.1"></span>God</span> we serve,
free from this day, and Roman citizens, and we release to you all your
private property.

<span id="iii.v.vi.ix-p5"></span>And, inasmuch as thou, Montana,
declarest that thou hast applied thy mind to monastic profession, we
therefore this day give and grant to thee two *unciæ*, which the
presbyter Gaudiosus by the disposition of his last will is known to have
left to thee in the way of institution <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) , provided that all go in all
respects to the advantage of the monastery of Saint Laurence, over which
the abbess Constantina presides, and in which by the mercy of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.ix-p6.1"></span>God</span> thou art about
to make profession.  But, if it should appear that thou hast in any way
concealed any part of the property left by the above-written Gaudiosus,
the whole of this must undoubtedly be transferred to the possession of
our Church.

<span id="iii.v.vi.ix-p7"></span> <span id="page_192b">p. 192b</span>
<span id="iii.v.vi.ix-Page_192b"></span>Moreover to thee, Thomas
above-written, whom for enhancement of thy freedom we desire also to
serve among the notaries, we in like manner this day give and grant by
this writ of manumission the five *unciæ* which the aforesaid presbyter
Gaudiosus by his last will left to thee under the title of inheritance,
together with the dowry which he had bestowed upon thy mother; to wit
with this annexed law and condition, that, in case of thy dying without
legitimate children, that is children born in lawful wedlock, all that
we have granted thee shall revert without any diminution to the
possession of the holy Roman Church.  But, if thou shouldest have
children both in wedlock, as we have said, and recognized by the law,
and shouldest leave them surviving thee, then we appoint thee to remain
master of this same property without any condition, and give thee full
power to make a will with respect to it.  These things, then, which we
have appointed and granted by this charter of manumission, know ye that
we and our successors will observe without any demur.  For the rule of
justice and reason suggests that one who desires his own orders to be
observed by his successors should undoubtedly keep to the will and
ordinances of his predecessor.  This writ of manumission we have
dictated to the notary Paterius to be put in writing, and for the
fullest security have subscribed it with our own hand, together with
three chief presbyters and three deacons, and have delivered it to you.

<span id="iii.v.vi.ix-p8"></span>Done in the city of Rome.
