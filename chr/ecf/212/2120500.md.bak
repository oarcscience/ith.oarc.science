id="iii.v.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.xiv-p2"></span>To John, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xiv-p3"></span>Gregory to John, Bishop of Syracuse.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xiv-p4"></span>Moved by the benevolence of the
Apostolic See and by the order of ancient custom, we have thought fit to
grant to thy Fraternity, who art known to have received the office of
government in the Church of Syracuse, the use of the pallium; that is,
at such times and in such manner as thou knowest without doubt that it
was used by thy predecessor; nevertheless admonishing thee that, as thou
rejoicest in having received from us the use of this decoration for the
honour of thy priestly office, so also by probity of manners and deeds
thou strive to adorn the office thou hast received unto our glory in
Christ.  For thus wilt thou be conspicuous for decorations mutually
answering to each other, if with this habit for the body the excellence
also of thy mind agrees.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xiv-p5"></span>For all privileges which are known to
have been granted formerly to thy Church we confirm by our authority,
and decree that they shall remain inviolate.
