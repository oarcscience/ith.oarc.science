<span id="iii.v.vi.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xli-p1.1"></span>Epistle LX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.xli-p2"></span>To Eulogius, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xli-p3"></span>Gregory to Eulogius, Bishop of
Alexandria.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xli-p4"></span>Charity, the mother and guardian of
all that is good, which binds together in union the hearts of many,
regards not as absent him whom it has present in the mind’s eye.  Since
then, dearest brother, we are held together by the root of charity,
neither will bodily absence nor distance of places have power to assert
any claim over us, inasmuch as we who are one are surely not far from
each other.  Now we wish to have always this common charity with the
rest of our brethren.  Yet there is something that binds us in a certain
peculiar way to the Church of Alexandria, and compels us, as it were by
a special law, to be the more prone to love it.  For, as it is known to
all that the blessed evangelist Mark was sent by Saint Peter the
apostle, his master, to Alexandria, so we are bound together in the
unity of this master and his disciple, so that I seem to preside over
the see of the disciple because of the master, and you over the see of
the master because of the disciple.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xli-p5"></span>Moreover to this unity of hearts we
are bound also by the merits of your Holiness, since we know that you
follow profitably the ordinances of your founder, and feel how you
betake yourself with entire devotion to the bosom of your master, whence
sprung the preaching of salvation in your parts.  And so, when we
received the letters of your Holiness, as much as our heart rejoiced in
your brotherly visitation, so much is it oppressed with sadness for the
untold burdens which you refer to, and we groan with you in brotherly
sympathy for your grief.  But, since a shaking of various kinds is
extending itself everywhere, in the midst of a common need one should
grieve less for one’s own, but study rather, by patiently enduring, to
overcome what we cannot altogether avoid.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xli-p6"></span>But what we ourselves are suffering
from the swords of the Lombards in the daily plundering and mangling and
slaying of our citizens, we refuse to tell, lest, while speaking of our
own sorrows, we should increase yours from the sympathy which you bestow
upon us.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xli-p7"></span>Furthermore, a little time ago we sent
to Sabinianus, who represents our Church in the royal city, a letter
from ourselves, which he should have sent on to your Fraternity <span
id="fr_1673"></span>[1674](#fn_1673.md) .  If you have received it, we
wonder why you have sent us no reply to it.  And accordingly, since
caution must be taken lest the pride of any one whatever introduce
offence in the Churches, it is needful that you should carefully peruse
it, and with all diligence and full bent of mind maintain what pertains
to your dignity and to the peace of the Church.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xli-p9"></span>Now may Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.xli-p9.1"></span>God</span>, who by the
grace of His loving-kindness has conferred on you the disposition and
charity that becomes a priest, protect you in His service, and keep you
within and without from all adversity, and mercifully grant that the
souls of wanderers may be converted to Himself by your preaching.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xli-p10"></span>We have received with the charity
that was due to the bearer of these presents, our common son the deacon
Isidore, who brought to us the benediction <span
id="fr_1674"></span>[1675](#fn_1674.md) of Saint Mark the evangelist.  And
you indeed, being resplendent in the merit of a good life, have sent to
us the sweetly smelling word, which is nigh unto Paradise.  But we, to
wit because we are sinners, send you wood from the West, which, <span
id="page_207b">p. 207b</span> <span
id="iii.v.vi.xli-Page_207b"></span>being suitable for the building of
ships, signifies the tumult of our mind, as being ever tossed in the
sea-waves; and we wished indeed to send larger pieces, but the ship was
not large enough to hold them <span id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675.md)
.  In the month of August, Indiction 14.
