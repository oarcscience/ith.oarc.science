id="iii.v.i.xvii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xvii-p2"></span>*To Natalis, Bishop of Salona* <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320.md) .

<span id="iii.v.i.xvii-p4"></span>Gregory to Natalis, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xvii-p5"></span>We have received at the hands of the
deacon Stephen, whom you sent to us, the letters of thy Reverence,
wherein you congratulate us on our promotion.  And truly what has been
offered in the kindness and earnestness of charity demands full
credence, reason having prompted your pontifical order to rejoice with
us.  We therefore, being cheered by your greeting, declare in conscience
that I undertook the burden of dignity with a sick heart.  But, seeing
that I could not resist the divine decrees, I have recovered a more
cheerful frame of mind.  Wherefore we write to entreat your Reverence
that both we and the Christian flock committed to our care may enjoy the
succour of your prayers, to the end that in the security of that
protection we may have power to overcome the hurricanes of these times.

<span id="iii.v.i.xvii-p6"></span>The month of February, ninth
indiction.

<span id="iii.v.i.xvii-p3"></span> This appears to have been the formal
answer to the official letter sent by the bishop of Salona to Gregory,
congratulating him on his accession to the popedom, having no connexion
with, and perhaps written before, the preceding Epistle XIX.
