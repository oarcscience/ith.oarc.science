<span id="ii.iv.clii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.clii-p1.1"></span>Letter CLVIII <span
id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585.md) .</span>

<span id="ii.iv.clii-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.clii-p3.1"></span>To the Catholic Bishops of Egypt Sojourning
in Constantinople.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.clii-p4"></span>Leo to the catholic Egyptian bishops
sojourning in Constantinople.

<span id="ii.iv.clii-p5"></span>He encourages them in their sufferings
for the Faith, and in their entreaties for redress to the Emperor.

<span id="ii.iv.clii-p6"></span>I have before now been so saddened by
tidings of the crimes committed in Alexandria, and my spirit has been so
wounded by the atrocity of the deed itself, that I know not what tears
to show and what lamentation to utter over it, and am fain to use the
prophet’s language, “who will give waters to my head and a fountain of
tears to my eyes <span id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586.md) ?”  Yet
anticipating your complaint, beloved, I have entreated our most clement
and Christian Emperor for a remedy of these great evils, and by our sons
and assistants Gerontius and Olympius have at a different time demanded
that he should make haste to purge of a heresy already condemned the
church of that city, in which so many Catholic teachers have flourished,
and not allow murderous spirits whom no reverence for place or
time <span id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587.md) could deter from shedding
their ruler’s blood, to gain anything from his clemency, more
particularly when they desire to reconsider the council of Chalcedon to
the overthrow of the Faith.  Accordingly the same reason, beloved, which
drove you from your own Sees, ought to console you for your sufferings;
for it is certain that afflicted souls, that suffer adversity for His
name, are in no wise deprived of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.clii-p8.1"></span>Lord’s</span> protection.  Bear it therefore
bravely, and mindful of that country which is yours, rejoice over your
present sojourn in a strange land.  Abstain from grieving over your
exile and indulge not in sorrow for your present weariness, ye who know
that the Apostle glories even in his many perils on behalf of the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.clii-p8.2"></span>Lord’s</span> Faith.  You
have One who knows your conflicts and has prepared the rewards of
recompense.  Let no one shrink from this labour, whose guerdon is to
reign and <span id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588.md) live for ever.  Let
the feet of all who fight be fixed in the halls of Jerusalem; for in the
hope of that retribution they will have no cause to fear the camp nor
the onsets of the enemy.  Victory is never hard nor triumph difficult
over the remnants of an abject foe who has been routed by the whole
world alike, especially over those whose ringleaders you see already
prostrate.  With unceasing prayers, therefore (even as I also have not
failed to do), entreat the favour of the most Christian Emperor, who in
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.clii-p9.2"></span>God’s</span> mercy is
ready to hear:  that in accordance with the letter I have sent <span
id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589.md) , he may strengthen the cause of the
common Faith with that devotion of mind, which we are well assured he
possesses, and in his piety may remove all the harmful charges which the
madness of heretics has invented, and arrange for your return, beloved,
and so may cause each several province and all the churches with their
priests to rejoice in the unshaken peace of Christ.  Dated the 1st of
Dec. in the consulship of Constantine and Rufus (457).

<span id="ii.iv.clii-p2"></span> One of three Letters, the other two
being CLIV. and CLX., first printed by Quesnel on the authority
apparently of a single <span class="sc"><span

to the bishops (and clergy) who had fled out of Egypt to Constantinople
in consequence of the recent disturbances.  Letter CLX. mentions fifteen
of them by name but is not otherwise so interesting as CLVIII., the one
selected for translation.
