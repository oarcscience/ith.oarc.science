<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Sermon LXIII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p2.1"></span>(On the Passion, XII.:  preached on
Wednesday.)</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p3"></span>I.  *<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p3.1"></span>God</span> chose to save man by strength
made perfect in weakness.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p4"></span>The glory, dearly-beloved, of the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxii-p4.1"></span>Lord’s</span> Passion, on
which we promised to speak again to-day, is chiefly wonderful for its
mystery of humility, which has both ransomed and instructed us all, that
He, Who paid the price, might also impart His righteousness to us.  For
the Omnipotence of the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p4.2"></span>God</span>, whereby He is by the same
Essence equal to the Father, might have rescued mankind from the
dominion of the devil by the mere exercise of Its will, had it not
better suited the Divine working to conquer the opposition of the foe’s
wickedness by that which had been conquered, and to restore our nature’s
liberty by that very nature by which bondage had come upon the whole
race.  But, when the evangelist says, “The Word became flesh and dwelt
in us <span id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042.md) ,” and the Apostle,
“<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxii-p5.2"></span>God</span> was in
Christ reconciling the world to Himself <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043.md) ,” it was shown that the
Only-begotten of the Most High Father entered on such a union with human
humility, that, when He took the substance of our flesh and soul, He
remained one and the same Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p6.2"></span>God</span> by exalting our properties, not
His own:  because it was the weakness, not the power that had to be
reinforced, so that upon the union of the creature with the Creator
there should be nothing wanting of the Divine to the assumed, nor of the
human to the Assuming.

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p7"></span>II.  *<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p7.1"></span>God’s</span> plan was always partially
understood, and is now of universal application.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p8"></span>This plan of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p8.1"></span>God’s</span> mercy and justice, though in
the ages past it was in a measure enshrouded in darkness, was yet not so
completely hidden that the saints, who have most merited praise from the
beginning till the coming of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p8.2"></span>Lord</span>, were precluded from
understanding it:  seeing that the salvation, which was to come through
Christ, was promised both by the words of prophecy and by the
significance of events, and this salvation not only they attained who
foretold it, but all they also who believed their predictions.  For the
one Faith justifies the saints of all ages, and to the self-same hope of
the faithful pertains all that by Jesus Christ, the Mediator between
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxii-p8.3"></span>God</span> and man,
we acknowledge done, or our fathers reverently accepted as to be done. 
And between Jew and Gentile there is no distinction, since, as the
Apostle says, “Circumcision is <span id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span
id="ii.v.xxxii-Page_176"></span>nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing,
but the keeping of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p8.4"></span>God’s</span> commands <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044.md) ,” and if they be kept in entirety
of faith, they make Christians the true sons of Abraham, that is
perfect, for the same Apostle says, “For whosoever of you were baptized
in Christ Jesus, have put on Christ.  There is neither Jew nor Greek: 
there is neither slave nor free:  there is neither male nor female.  For
ye are all one in Christ.  But if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s
seed, heirs according to promise <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md) .”

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p11"></span>III.  *The union of the Divine Head
with Its members inseparable.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p12"></span>There is no doubt therefore,
dearly-beloved, that man’s nature has been received by the Son of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxii-p12.1"></span>God</span> into such a
union that not only in that Man Who is the first-begotten of all
creatures, but also in all His saints there is one and the self-same
Christ, and as the Head cannot be separated from the members, so the
members cannot be separated from the Head.  For although it is not in
this life, but in eternity that <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p12.2"></span>God</span> is to be “all in all <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046.md) ,” yet even now He is the
inseparable Inhabitant of His temple, which is the Church, according as
He Himself promised, saying, “Lo!  I am with you all the days till the
end of the age <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047.md) .”  And
agreeably therewith the Apostle says, “He is the head of the body, the
Church, which is the beginning, the first-begotten from the dead, that
in all things He may have the pre-eminence, because in Him it was
pleasing that all fulness (of the Godhead) should dwell, and that
through Him all things should be reconciled in Himself <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048.md) .”

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p16"></span>IV.  *Christ’s passion provided a
saving mystery and an example for us to follow.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p17"></span>And what is suggested to our hearts by
these and many other references, save that we should in all things be
renewed in His image Who, remaining “in the form of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxii-p17.1"></span>God <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md) </span>,” deigned to “take the
form” of sinful flesh?  For all our weaknesses, which come from sin, He
took on Him without sharing in sin, so that He felt the sensation of
hunger and thirst and sleep and fatigue, and grief and weeping, and
suffered the fiercest pangs up to the extremity of death, because no one
could be loosed from the snares of death, unless He in Whom alone all
men’s nature was guileless allowed Himself to be slain by the hands of
wicked men.  And hence our Saviour the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p18.2"></span>God</span> provided for all that believe in
Him both a mystery and an example <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050.md) , that they might apprehend the one
by being born again, and follow the other by imitation.  For the blessed
Apostle Peter teaches this, saying, “Christ suffered for us, leaving you
an example that ye should follow His steps.  Who did no sin, neither was
guile found in His mouth.  Who when He was reviled, reviled not:  when
He suffered, threatened not, but gave Himself up to His unjust judge. 
Who Himself bare our sins in His body on the tree, that being dead to
sins, we may live to righteousness <span
id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051.md) .”

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p21"></span>V.  *Christ not destroyed, but
fulfilled and elevated the Law.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p22"></span>As therefore there is no believer,
dearly-beloved, to whom the gifts of grace are denied, so there is no
one who is not a debtor in the matter of Christian discipline; because,
although the severity of the mystic Law is done away, yet the benefits
of its voluntary observance have increased, as the evangelist John says,
“Because the Law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came
through Jesus Christ <span id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md) .”  For
all things that, according to the Law, went before, whether in the
circumcision of the flesh, or in the multitude of victims, or in the
keeping of the Sabbath, testified of Christ, and foretold the grace of
Christ.  And He is “the end of the Law <span
id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053.md) ,” not by annulling, but by
fulfilling its meanings.  For although He is at once the Author of the
old and of the new, yet He changed the symbolic rites connected with the
promises, because He accomplished the promises and put an end to the
announcement by the coming of the Announced.  But in the matter of moral
precepts, no decrees of the earlier Testament are rejected, but many of
them are amplified by the Gospel teaching:  so that the things which
give salvation are more perfect and clearer than those which promise a
Saviour.

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p25"></span>VI.  *The present effect of Christ’s
passion is daily realized by Christians, especially in Holy Baptism.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p26"></span>All therefore that the Son of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxii-p26.1"></span>God</span> did and taught
for the world’s reconciliation, we not only know as a matter of past
history, but appreciate in the power of its present effect.  It is He
Who, born of the Virgin Mother by the Holy Ghost, fertilizes His
unpolluted Church with the same blessed Spirit, that by <span
id="page_177">p. 177</span> <span id="ii.v.xxxii-Page_177"></span>the
birth of Baptism an innumerable multitude of sons may be born to <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxii-p26.2"></span>God</span>, of Whom it is
said, “who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
the will of man, but of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p26.3"></span>God <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054.md) </span>.”  It is He, in Whom the
seed of Abraham is blessed by the adoption of the whole world <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md) , and the patriarch becomes the
father of nations by the birth, through faith not flesh, of the sons of
promise.  It is He Who, without excluding any nation, makes one flock of
holy sheep from every nation under heaven, and daily fulfils what He
promised, saying, “Other sheep also I have which are not of this fold;
them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be
one flock and one shepherd <span id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md)
.”  For though to the blessed Peter first and foremost He says, “Feed My
sheep <span id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md) ;” yet the one <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxii-p30.2"></span>Lord</span> directs the
charge of all the shepherds, and feeds those that come to the rock with
such glad and well-watered pastures, that countless sheep are nourished
by the richness of His love, and hesitate not to perish for the
Shepherd’s sake, even as the good Shepherd Himself was content to lay
down His life for His sheep.  It is He whose sufferings are shared not
only by the martyrs’ glorious courage, but also in the very act of
regeneration by the faith of all the new-born.  For the renunciation of
the devil and belief in <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p30.3"></span>God <span
id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) </span>, the passing from the old
state into newness of life, the casting off of the earthly image, and
the putting on of the heavenly form—all this is a sort of dying and
rising again, whereby he that is received by Christ and receives Christ
is not the same after as he was before he came to the font, for the body
of the regenerate becomes the flesh of the Crucified <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p33"></span>VII.  *The good works of Christians are
only part of Christ’s good works.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p34"></span>This change, dearly-beloved, is the
handiwork of the Most High <span id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md) ,
Who “worketh all things in all,” so that by the good manner of life
observed in each one of the faithful, we know Him to be the Author of
all just works, and give thanks to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p35.2"></span>God’s</span> mercy, Who so adorns the whole
body of the Church with countless gracious gifts, that through the many
rays of the one Light the same brightness is everywhere diffused, and
that which is well done by any Christian whatsoever cannot but be part
of the glory of Christ.  This is that true Light which justifies and
enlightens every man.  This it is that rescues from the power of
darkness and transfers us into the Kingdom of the Son of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxii-p35.3"></span>God</span>.  This it is
that by newness of life exalts the desires of the mind and quenches the
lusts of the flesh.  This it is whereby the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p35.4"></span>Lord’s</span> Passover is duly kept “With
the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth” by the casting away of “the
old leaven of wickedness <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md) ”
and the inebriating and feeding of the new creature with the very <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxii-p36.2"></span>Lord</span>.  For naught
else is brought about by the partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ
than that we pass into that which we then take <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md) , and both in spirit and in body
carry everywhere Him, in and with Whom we were dead, buried, and rose
again, as the Apostle says, “For ye are dead, and your life is hid with
Christ in <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p37.1"></span>God</span>.  For when Christ, your life,
shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063.md) .”  Who with the Father, &c.
