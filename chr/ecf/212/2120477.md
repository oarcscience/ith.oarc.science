<span id="iii.v.v.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xxiii-p2"></span>*To Andrew, Scholasticus* <span
id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md) .

<span id="iii.v.v.xxiii-p4"></span>Gregory to Andrew, &c.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxiii-p5"></span>We have been desirous of carrying out
the wish of the most excellent the lord Patrician as to the person of
Donatus, the archdeacon; but, seeing that it is very dangerous to the
soul to lay hands on any one rashly, we took care to examine by a
thorough investigation into his life and deeds.  And, since many things
have been discovered, as we have written to the said lord Patrician,
which remove him far from the episcopate, we, fearing the judgment of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxiii-p5.1"></span>God</span>, have
not thought fit to consent to his ordination.  But neither have we
presumed to ordain John, the presbyter, who is ignorant of the psalms,
since this circumstance certainly shewed him to be too little in earnest
about himself.  These, then, being excluded, when we had urged the
parties to choose some one from among their own people <span
id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) , and they declared that they had
no one fit for this office, and when we together with them were the more
distressed, they at length, with one common voice and consent,
repeatedly solicited our venerable brother the presbyter Marinianus, who
they learnt had been associated with me for a long time in a monastery. 
He, shrinking from the office, was at last, by various means, with
difficulty persuaded to give assent to their petition.  And, since we
were well acquainted with his life, and knew him to be solicitous in
winning souls, we did not delay his ordination.  Let, therefore, your
Glory receive him as is <span id="page_181b">p. 181b</span> <span
id="iii.v.v.xxiii-Page_181b"></span>becoming, and extend to his newness
the aid of your succour.  For to all, as you know, newness in any office
whatever is very trying.  But I have great confidence that Almighty
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxiii-p6.1"></span>God</span>, who
has vouchsafed to put him over His flock, will both stimulate him to
give heed to what is inward, and comfort him with the loving-kindness of
His grace for administering what is outward.  But, inasmuch as, after
his long enjoyment of quiet, his newness, as we have before said, will
without doubt expose him to perturbation, I beg that, when he shall come
to you flying from the whirlwinds of secular storms, he may always find
in your heart a haven of rest, and be cheered by the boon of your
charity.  But you will soon learn how much you will find yourselves able
to agree; for he comes unwillingly to the episcopate <span
id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md) .

<span id="iii.v.v.xxiii-p3"></span> On the term “Scholasticus,” see V.
36, note 9.  It appears from this and other epistles that persons thus
designated were addressed as “Gloria vestra.”  The “Patrician” mentioned
in this letter as having recommended the Archdeacon Donatus to succeed
John as Archbishop of Ravenna, was Romanus Patricius, Exarch of Italy,
who died <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxiii-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 598.  He is often addressed
or referred to in the Epistles.  See Index.
