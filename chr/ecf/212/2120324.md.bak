id="iii.v.i.xxii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXIX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xxii-p2"></span>*To Aristobulus, Ex-Prefect and
Antigraphus* <span id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327.md) .

<span id="iii.v.i.xxii-p4"></span>Gregory to Aristobulus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxii-p5"></span>For fully expressing my affection I
confess that my tongue suffices not:  but your own affection will better
tell you all that I feel towards you.  I have heard that you are
suffering from certain oppositions.  But I am not greatly grieved for
this, since it is often the case that a ship which might have reached
the depths of the ocean had the breeze been favourable is driven back by
an opposing wind at the very beginning of its voyage, but by being
driven back is recalled into port.  Furthermore, if you should by any
chance receive for interpretation a lengthy letter of mine, translate
it, I pray you, not word for word, but so as to give the sense; since
usually, when close rendering of the words is attended to, the force of
the ideas is lost.
