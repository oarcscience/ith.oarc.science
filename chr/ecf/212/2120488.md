id="iii.v.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Epistle II.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.ii-p2"></span>To the Clergy and People of Ravenna.

<span id="iii.v.vi.ii-p3"></span>Gregory to the clergy and people of the
Church of Ravenna.

<span id="iii.v.vi.ii-p4"></span>We have been informed that certain men,
instigated by the malignant spirit, have wished to corrupt your minds by
false speech with regard to the reputation of our brother and
fellow-bishop Marinianus <span id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md) ;
saying that this our brother venerates the holy synod of Chalcedon less
than becomes him <span id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628.md) .  On this
head both he himself in person will satisfy you all of the integrity of
his faith, and we fully testify that, having been nursed from his cradle
in the bosom of the holy Universal Church, he has held the right
preaching of the faith with the attestation of his life.  For he
venerates the holy Nicene synod in which Arius, the Constantinopolitan,
in which Macedonius, the first Ephesine, in which Nestorius, and the
holy Chalcedonian, in which Dioscorus and Eutyches were condemned.  And
if any one presumes ever to speak anything against the faith of these
four synods and against the tome and definition of pope Leo of holy
memory, let him be anathema.  Accordingly, receiving the fullest
satisfaction, love ye your pastor in entire charity with a pure heart,
that the intercession of the same your pastor, poured out purely before
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.ii-p6.1"></span>God</span>, may
avail to your profit.

<span id="iii.v.vi.ii-p6"></span> The ground of this charge against
Marinianus was doubtless his acceptance of the condemnation of the
“Three Chapters” by the fifth council, which condemnation,
notwithstanding Rome’s approval of it, was still objected to in many
quarters as contravening the council of Chalcedon.  See I. 16, note 3;
IV. 2, note 1; IV. 38, 39; XIV. 12.
