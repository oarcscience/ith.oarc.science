id="iii.v.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXIX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.xv-p2"></span>*To Maurilius and Vitalianus* <span
id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415.md) .

<span id="iii.v.ii.xv-p4"></span>Gregory to Maurilius and Vitalianus,
*magistris militum*.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xv-p5"></span>On receiving your Glory’s letters we
gave thanks to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xv-p5.1"></span>God</span> that we were assured of your
safety; and we greatly rejoiced at your careful provision; and what you
wrote about was at once prepared.  But the magnificent Aldio wrote to us
after the arrival of your men that Ariulph was already near at hand, and
we feared that the soldiers sent to you might fall into his hands.  Yet
here also, so far as <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xv-p5.2"></span>God</span> may give aid, our son the
glorious *magister militum* has prepared himself against him.  But, if
the enemy himself should advance hither, let your Glory also, as you
have been accustomed to do, accomplish what you can in his rear.  For we
hope in the power of Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xv-p5.3"></span>God</span>, and that of the blessed Peter
himself, the Prince of the apostles, on whose anniversary he desires to
shed blood, that he may find him also without delay opposed to him.
