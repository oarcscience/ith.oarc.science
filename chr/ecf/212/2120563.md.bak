<span id="iii.v.viii.ii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p1.1"></span>Epistle II.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.ii-p2"></span>To Anastasius, Bishop of Antioch.

<span id="iii.v.viii.ii-p3"></span>Gregory to Anastasius, Patriarch of
Antioch.

<span id="iii.v.viii.ii-p4"></span>I have received the letters of your
most sweet Blessedness, which flowed with tears for words.  For I saw in
them a cloud flying aloft as clouds do; but, though it carried with it a
darkness of sorrow, I could not easily discover at its commencement
whence it came or whither it was going, since by reason of the darkness
I speak of I did not fully understand its origin.  Yet it becomes you,
most holy ones, ever to recall to mind what the preacher to the Gentiles
says; *In the last times perilous times shall be at hand, and there
shall be men loving themselves, covetous, lifted up* ([1 Tim. iv.
1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p4.1"></span>); and what follows, which it would be a
trouble for me to speak, and which is not necessary for you to hear. 
Lo, in your holy old age, your Blessedness labours under many
tribulations; but consider in whose seat you sit <span
id="fr_1727"></span>[1728](#fn_1727.md) .  Is it not in his to whom it was
said by the voice of the truth, *When thou shalt be old, another shall
gird thee and carry thee whether thou wouldest not* ([Joh. xxi.
18](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p5.1"></span>)?  But in saying this I recollect that
your Holiness even from your youth has toiled under many adversities. 
Say then with the good king, *I will think again over all my years in
the bitterness of my soul* ([Isa. 1:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000.md),
[Isa. 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p5.2"></span>).  For there are many who, as you say in
your letter, make to themselves pastime over our wounds:  but we know
who said, *Ye shall lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice; and ye
shall be sorrowful* ([Joh. xvi.
20](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p5.3"></span>):  where also he forthwith adds, *But
your sorrow shall* <span id="page_232b">p. 232b</span> <span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-Page_232b"></span>*be turned into joy.*  But, since we
already suffer what was foretold, it remains that we should also hope
for what was promised.  For as to these of whom you say that they
themselves lay on the burdens which they ought to have lightened, I know
that they are those who come in sheep’s clothing, and inwardly are
ravening wolves ([Matth. vii](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#000.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p5.4"></span>.).  But they are so much the more to be
endured as they persecute us not only with a malicious mind, but also in
religious guise.  And in that they desire to have to themselves above
others what it were not fit that they should have even with their
brethren, we are in no wise disturbed at this, since we trust in
Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p5.5"></span>God</span> that those who desire what
belongs to others will be the sooner deprived even of what is their
own.  For we know who said, *That every one that exalteth himself shall
be abased* ([Luke xiv. 11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p5.6"></span>).  And again it is written, *Before a
fall the heart is exalted* ([Prov. xvi.
18](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p5.7"></span>).

<span id="iii.v.viii.ii-p6"></span>But in these days, as I find, new
wars of heretics are arising, about whom I have before now written to
your Blessedness, in such sort that they attempt to invalidate the
prophets, the Gospels, and all the sayings of the Fathers.  But, while
the life of your Holiness endures, we trust in the favour of our
Protector that their mouths which have been opened against the solidity
of the truth may be the sooner stopped, inasmuch as, however sharp may
be the swords that are employed, they recoil broken when they strike the
rock.  Moreover there is this by the great favour of Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.viii.ii-p6.1"></span>God</span>; that among
those who are divided from the doctrine of Holy Church there is no
unity, since every kingdom divided against itself shall not stand ([Luke
xi](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#000.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p6.2"></span>.).  And holy Church is always more
thoroughly equipped in her teaching when assaulted by the questionings
of heretics; so that what was said by the Psalmist concerning <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.viii.ii-p6.3"></span>God</span> against
heretics is fulfilled, *They are divided from the wrath of his
countenance, and his heart hath drawn nigh* ([Psa.
55.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p6.4"></span> <span
id="fr_1728"></span>[1729](#fn_1728) .md).  For while they are divided in
their wicked error, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p7.1"></span>God</span> brings His heart near to us,
because, being taught by contradictions, we more thoroughly learn to
understand Him.

<span id="iii.v.viii.ii-p8"></span>Further, what ills we suffer from the
swords of barbarians, and what from the perversity of judges, I shrink
from relating to your Blessedness, lest I should increase your groaning,
which I ought to diminish by consolation.  But in all these things the
precepts of our Master comfort me, who says, *These things have I spoken
unto you, that in me ye might have peace.  In the world ye shall have
tribulation* ([John xvi. 33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p8.1"></span>).  For I consider to whom it was said,
*This is your hour, and the power of darkness* ([Luke xxii.
53](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#053.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p8.2"></span>).  If, then, the hour of light will be
afterwards, since it is said to the elect, *Ye are the light of the
world* ([Matth. v. 14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p8.3"></span>), and as it is written, *The righteous
shall have dominion over them in the morning* ([Psa.
49.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p8.4"></span>) <span
id="fr_1729"></span>[1730](#fn_1729.md) , whatever we suffer in the hour of
the power of darkness is not to be deplored.

<span id="iii.v.viii.ii-p10"></span>Moreover your most sweet Holiness
tells me that you would have wished, if it could have been so, to
converse with me without paper and pen, and grieves that a distance
almost as far as the East is from the West lies between us.  But this
which I feel I declare is true; that on paper your soul speaks to me
without paper, since in the words of your Holiness charity alone sounds,
and we are not divided by distance of place who, of the gift of Almighty
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.viii.ii-p10.1"></span>God</span>, are
joined together in the bond of love.  Why then seek you to have given
you the wings of a dove covered with silver, when you already have
them?  For indeed these wings are love of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p10.2"></span>God</span> and of our neighbour.  For by
these holy Church flies aloft, and by these transcends all that is
earthly; which if your Holiness had not, you would not have come to me
by letter with so great charity.

<span id="iii.v.viii.ii-p11"></span>Further, I beg you to pray earnestly
in behalf of the weakness of my heart, to the end that Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.viii.ii-p11.1"></span>God</span> may through
your intercession defend my soul from all evils, and the sooner snatch
me away from the hurricanes of this time, which are so many, and bring
me to the shores of eternal rest.

<span id="iii.v.viii.ii-p12"></span>I have received all the very rich
blessings <span id="fr_1730"></span>[1731](#fn_1730.md) , directed to me,
which thou, as a man of God poor in spirit, hast sent me, saying of
them, For what can a poor man give but what is poor?  But had you not
been poor through a spirit of humility, your blessings would not have
been rich.  May Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.ii-p13.1"></span>God</span> guard you by His protection
from all evils; and, since your life is very necessary for all good men,
bring you after many years yet to come to the joys of the heavenly
country.
