<span id="iii.v.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Epistle IV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.ii-p2"></span>To Constantius, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.v.ii-p3"></span>Gregory to Constantius, Bishop of
Mediolanum (*Milan*).

<span id="iii.v.v.ii-p4"></span>If licence to be restored to their rank
be granted to the lapsed, the force of ecclesiastical discipline is
undoubtedly broken, while in the hope of restoration each person fears
not to give way to his evil inclinations.  Your Fraternity, for
instance, has consulted us as to whether Amandinus, ex-presbyter and
ex-abbot, who was deposed by your predecessor for fault requiring it,
should be called back to his rank; which thing is not allowable; and we
decree that it cannot on any account be done.  Yet, if it should be the
case that his manner of life deserves it, seeing that he has been
deprived altogether of his sacred office, assign him a place in a
monastery, as you may see fit, before other monks.  Above all things,
then, take care that no one’s supplication persuade you in any way to
restore the lapsed to their sacred orders, lest such punishment should
be supposed not to be definitely ordained for them, but only a temporary
expedient.

<span id="iii.v.v.ii-p5"></span>As to Vitalianus the ex-presbyter, about
whom you write that he should be strictly guarded, we will cause him to
be sent into Sicily, that, being deprived of all hope of departure
thence, he may then at least constrain himself to penitential
bewailing.  Jobinus also, of Portus Veneris, once deacon and abbot, we
have decreed to be deprived of his office, and written that another
should be ordained in his place.  In like manner also we decree that the
three subdeacons, whom your Fraternity has notified to us as having
lapsed, shall ever cease from and stand deprived of their office, and
that nothing beyond lay communion be allowed them.  Further, we have
adjudged the ex-presbyter Saturninus to give security that he will not
ever presume to approach the ministry of his sacred order.  And we
desire him to remain, with deprivation of his sacred order, in the same
island in which he was, permitting him to have and exercise care and
solicitude with respect to monasteries; for we believe that, his lapse
having made him more wary, he will now the more carefully keep guard
over those who are committed to him.

<span id="iii.v.v.ii-p6"></span>Further, concerning John, notary of your
church, the charity wherewith we love you and have long loved you warns
us to write, lest you should order anything with regard <span
id="page_163b">p. 163b</span> <span id="iii.v.v.ii-Page_163b"></span>to
him while you are still provoked by his fault.  Guarding, then, against
this, enquire fully by all means in your power into the possessions of
your church; by which means neither may you offend <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.ii-p6.1"></span>God</span>, nor may he be
able to find a ground for accusing you before men.  For we write, not as
defending John or commending him personally without reason, but lest
your soul should be in any way burdened with sin under the incitement of
anger.  Whence it is needful, as we have before said, that you should by
no means neglect to enquire, in the fear of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.ii-p6.2"></span>God</span>, with a full investigation into
the possessions of your church.

<span id="iii.v.v.ii-p7"></span>Furthermore, the epistle of your most
dear Fraternity has caused us to wonder much with respect to the person
of Fortunatus <span id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md) .  But either
that letter was not dictated by you, or certainly, if it is yours, we by
no means recognize in it our brother the lord Constantius.  For you
ought to have paid, and still ought to pay, attention to the fact that
it is in behalf of your reputation that we write.  For, when he asserts
that he suffers wrong among you, and has been unable to procure the
guardian’s (*defensoris*) aid, what else does he intimate but ill-will
on your part?  Wherefore, that neither this affair may dim your
reputation in some quarters nor damage possibly ensue in any way with
good cause to your church, you ought to send hither a person instructed
by you, that the nature of the case may be examined, and the matter
terminated, without ill-will on your part.  And for this reason
especially, that if, after his complaint, sentence should be pronounced
among yourselves in your favour, he will be believed to have been
defeated, not reasonably, but by power alone.  But we, out of the
charity wherewith we are bound to you, desist not from admonishing you
to do what will be for your good repute, knowing that, though this
exhortation saddens you for the time, it will afterwards cause you joy,
when the animosity of contention has passed away.  In the month of
September, Indiction 13.  (In Vatic. *The month of December, Indict.*
13.)
