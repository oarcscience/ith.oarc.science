<span id="ii.v.iii"></span>

<span id="ii.v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Sermon III.</span>

<span id="ii.v.iii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.iii-p2.1"></span>On His Birthday, III:  Delivered on the
Anniversary of his Elevation to the Pontificate.</span>

<span id="ii.v.iii-p3"></span>I.  *The honour of being raised to the
episcopate must be referred solely to the Divine Head of the Church.*

<span id="ii.v.iii-p4"></span>As often as <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.iii-p4.1"></span>God’s</span> mercy deigns to bring round the
day of His gifts to us, there is, dearly-beloved, just and reasonable
cause for rejoicing, if only our appointment to the office be referred
to the praise of Him who gave it.  For though this recognition of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.iii-p4.2"></span>God</span> may well be found
in all His priests, yet I take it to be peculiarly binding on me, who,
regarding my own utter insignificance and the greatness of the office
undertaken, ought myself also to utter that exclamation of the Prophet,
“<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.iii-p4.3"></span>Lord</span>, I heard
Thy speech and was afraid:  I considered Thy works and was
dismayed <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) .”  For what is so
unwonted and so dismaying as labour to the frail, exaltation to the
humble, dignity to the undeserving?  And yet we do not despair nor lose
heart, because we put our trust not in ourselves but in Him who works in
us.  And hence also we have sung with harmonious voice the psalm of
David, dearly beloved, not in our own praise, but to the glory of Christ
the <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.iii-p5.2"></span>Lord</span>.  For
it is He of whom it is prophetically written, “Thou art a priest for
ever after the order of Melchizedeck <span
id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) ,” that is, not after the order of
Aaron, whose priesthood descending along his own line of offspring was a
temporal ministry, and ceased with the law of the Old Testament, but
after the order of Melchizedeck, in whom was prefigured the eternal High
Priest.  And no reference is made to his parentage because in him it is
understood that He was portrayed, whose generation cannot be declared. 
And finally, now that the mystery of this Divine priesthood has
descended to human agency, it runs not by the line of birth, nor is that
which flesh and blood created, chosen, but without regard to the
privilege of paternity and succession by inheritance, those men are
received by the Church as its rulers whom the Holy Ghost prepares:  so
that in the people of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.iii-p6.2"></span>God’s</span> adoption, the whole body of which
is priestly and royal, it is not the prerogative of earthly origin which
obtains the unction <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) , but the
condescension of Divine grace which creates the bishop.

<span id="ii.v.iii-p8"></span> <span id="page_117">p. 117</span> <span
id="ii.v.iii-Page_117"></span>II.  *From Christ and through S. Peter the
priesthood is handed on in perpetuity.*

<span id="ii.v.iii-p9"></span>Although, therefore, dearly beloved, we be
found both weak and slothful in fulfilling the duties of our office,
because, whatever devoted and vigorous action we desire to do, we are
hindered by the frailty of our very condition; yet having the unceasing
propitiation of the Almighty and perpetual Priest, who being like us and
yet equal with the Father, brought down His Godhead even to things
human, and raised His Manhood even to things Divine, we worthily and
piously rejoice over His dispensation, whereby, though He has delegated
the care of His sheep to many shepherds, yet He has not Himself
abandoned the guardianship of His beloved flock.  And from His
overruling and eternal protection we have received the support of the
Apostles’ aid also, which assuredly does not cease from its operation: 
and the strength of the foundation, on which the whole superstructure of
the Church is reared, is not weakened <span
id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md) by the weight of the temple that rests
upon it.  For the solidity of that faith which was praised in the chief
of the Apostles is perpetual:  and as that remains which Peter believed
in Christ, so that remains which Christ instituted in Peter.  For when,
as has been read in the Gospel lesson <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) , the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.iii-p11.1"></span>Lord</span> had asked the disciples whom they
believed Him to be amid the various opinions that were held, and the
blessed Peter had replied, saying, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
living <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.iii-p11.2"></span>God</span>,”
the <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.iii-p11.3"></span>Lord</span> says,
“Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona, because flesh and flood hath not
revealed it to thee, but My Father, which is in heaven.  And I say to
thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build My church,
and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.  And I will give
unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.  And whatsoever thou shalt
bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose
on earth, shall be loosed also in heaven <span
id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) .”

<span id="ii.v.iii-p13"></span>III.  *S. Peter’s work is still carried
out by his successors.*

<span id="ii.v.iii-p14"></span>The dispensation of Truth therefore
abides, and the blessed Peter persevering in the strength of the Rock,
which he has received, has not abandoned the helm of the Church, which
he undertook.  For he was ordained before the rest in such a way that
from his being called the Rock, from his being pronounced the
Foundation, from his being constituted the Doorkeeper of the kingdom of
heaven, from his being set as the Umpire to bind and to loose, whose
judgments shall retain their validity in heaven, from all these mystical
titles we might know the nature of his association with Christ.  And
still to-day he more fully and effectually performs what is entrusted to
him, and carries out every part of his duty and charge in Him and with
Him, through Whom he has been glorified.  And so if anything is rightly
done and rightly decreed by us, if anything is won from the mercy of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.iii-p14.1"></span>God</span> by our
daily supplications, it is of his work and merits whose power lives and
whose authority prevails in his See.  For this, dearly-beloved, was
gained by that confession, which, inspired in the Apostle’s heart by
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.iii-p14.2"></span>God</span> the Father,
transcended all the uncertainty of human opinions, and was endued with
the firmness of a rock, which no assaults could shake.  For throughout
the Church Peter daily says, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.iii-p14.3"></span>God</span>,” and every
tongue which confesses the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.iii-p14.4"></span>Lord</span>, accepts the instruction his
voice conveys.  This Faith conquers the devil, and breaks the bonds of
his prisoners.  It uproots us from this earth and plants us in heaven,
and the gates of Hades cannot prevail against it.  For with such
solidity is it endued by <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.iii-p14.5"></span>God</span> that the depravity of heretics
cannot mar it nor the unbelief of the heathen overcome it.

<span id="ii.v.iii-p15"></span>IV.  *This festival then is in S. Peter’s
honour, and the progress of his flock redounds to his glory.*

<span id="ii.v.iii-p16"></span>And so, dearly beloved, with reasonable
obedience we celebrate to-day’s festival by such methods, that in my
humble person he may be recognized and honoured, in whom abides the care
of all the shepherds, together with the charge of the sheep commended to
him, and whose dignity is not abated even in so unworthy an heir.  And
hence the presence of my venerable brothers and fellow-priests, so much
desired and valued by me, will be the more sacred and precious, if they
will transfer the chief honour of this service in which they have
deigned to take part to him whom they know to be not only the patron of
this see, but also the primate of all bishops.  When therefore we utter
our exhortations in your ears, holy brethren, believe that he is
speaking whose representative we are:  because it is his warning that we
give, nothing else but his teaching that we preach, beseeching you to
“gird up the loins of your <span id="page_118">p. 118</span> <span
id="ii.v.iii-Page_118"></span>mind <span
id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md) ,” and lead a chaste and sober life in
the fear of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.iii-p17.2"></span>God</span>, and not to let your mind forget
his supremacy and consent to the lusts of the flesh.  Short and fleeting
are the joys of this world’s pleasures which endeavour to turn aside
from the path of life those who are called to eternity.  The faithful
and religious spirit, therefore, must desire the things which are
heavenly, and being eager for the Divine promises, lift itself to the
love of the incorruptible Good and the hope of the true Light.  But be
sure, dearly-beloved, that your labour, whereby you resist vices and
fight against carnal desires, is pleasing and precious in <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.iii-p17.3"></span>God’s</span> sight, and in
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.iii-p17.4"></span>God’s</span> mercy
will profit not only yourselves but me also, because the zealous pastor
makes his boast of the progress of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.iii-p17.5"></span>Lord’s</span> flock.  “For ye are my crown
and joy <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) ,” as the Apostle says;
if your faith, which from the beginning of the Gospel has been preached
in all the world has continued in love and holiness.  For though the
whole Church, which is in all the world, ought to abound in all virtues,
yet you especially, above all people, it becomes to excel in deeds of
piety, because founded as you are on the very citadel of the Apostolic
Rock, not only has our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.iii-p18.2"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ redeemed you in
common with all men, but the blessed Apostle Peter has instructed you
far beyond all men.  Through the same Christ our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.iii-p18.3"></span>Lord</span>.
