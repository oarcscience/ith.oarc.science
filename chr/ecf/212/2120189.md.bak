<span id="ii.v.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p1.1"></span>Sermon XXII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xi-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p2.1"></span>On the Feast of the Nativity, II.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xi-p3"></span>I.  *The mystery of the Incarnation demands
our joy*.

<span id="ii.v.xi-p4"></span>Let us be glad in the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p4.1"></span>Lord</span>, dearly-beloved,
and rejoice with spiritual joy that there has dawned for us the day of
ever-new redemption, of ancient preparation <span
id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md) , of eternal bliss.  For as the year
rolls round, there recurs for us the commemoration <span
id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md) of our salvation, which promised from
the beginning, accomplished in the fulness of time will endure for ever;
on which we are bound with hearts up-lifted <span
id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md) to adore the divine mystery:  so that
what is the effect of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p7.1"></span>God’s</span> great gift may be celebrated by
the Church’s great rejoicings.  For <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p7.2"></span>God</span> the almighty and merciful, Whose
nature as goodness, Whose will is power, Whose work is mercy:  as soon
as the devil’s malignity killed us by the poison of his hatred, foretold
at the very beginning of the world the remedy His piety had prepared for
the restoration of us mortals:  proclaiming to the serpent that the seed
of the woman should come to crush the lifting of his baneful head by its
power, signifying no doubt that Christ <span id="page_130">p. 130</span>
<span id="ii.v.xi-Page_130"></span>would come in the flesh, <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p7.3"></span>God</span> and man, Who born
of a Virgin should by His uncorrupt birth condemn the despoiler of the
human stock. <span id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md)   Thus in the whole
and perfect nature of true man was true <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p8.1"></span>God</span> born, complete in what was His own,
complete in what was ours.  And “ours” we call what the Creator formed
in us from the beginning and what He undertook to repair.  For what the
deceiver brought in and the deceived admitted had no trace in the
Saviour.  Nor because He partook of man’s weaknesses, did He therefore
share our faults.  He took the form of a slave without stain of sin,
increasing the human and not diminishing the Divine:  because that
“emptying of Himself” whereby the Invisible made Himself visible and
Creator and <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p8.2"></span>Lord</span>
of all things as He was, wished to be mortal, was the condescension of
Pity not the failing of Power <span id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xi-p10"></span>II.  *The new character of the birth of
Christ explained.*

<span id="ii.v.xi-p11"></span>Therefore, when the time came, dearly
beloved, which had been fore-ordained for men’s redemption <span
id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736.md) , there enters these lower parts of
the world, the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p12.1"></span>God</span>, descending from His heavenly
throne and yet not quitting His Father’s glory, begotten in a new order,
by a new nativity.  In a new order, because being invisible in His own
nature He became visible in ours, and He whom nothing could contain, was
content to be contained:  abiding before all time He began to be in
time:  the <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p12.2"></span>Lord</span>
of all things, He obscured His immeasurable majesty and took on Him the
form of a servant:  being <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p12.3"></span>God</span>, that cannot suffer, He did not
disdain to be man that can, and immortal as He is, to subject Himself to
the laws of death <span id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737.md) .  And by a
new nativity He was begotten, conceived by a Virgin, born of a Virgin,
without paternal desire, without injury to the mother’s chastity: 
because such a birth as knew no taint of human flesh, became One who was
to be the Saviour of men, while it possessed in itself the nature of
human substance.  For when <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p13.1"></span>God</span> was born in the flesh, <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p13.2"></span>God</span> Himself was the
Father, as the archangel witnessed to the Blessed Virgin Mary:  “because
the Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the most High
shall overshadow thee:  and therefore, that which shall be born of thee
shall be called holy, the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p13.3"></span>God <span id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738.md)
</span>.”  The origin is different but the nature like:  not by
intercourse with man but by the power of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p14.2"></span>God</span> was it brought about:  for a Virgin
conceived, a Virgin bare, and a Virgin she remained.  Consider here not
the condition of her that bare but the will of Him that was born; for He
was born Man as He willed and was able.  If you inquire into the truth
of His nature, you must acknowledge the matter to be human:  if you
search for the mode of His birth, you must confess the power to be of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p14.3"></span>God</span>.  For the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p14.4"></span>Lord</span> Jesus
Christ came to do away with not to endure our pollutions:  not to
succumb to our faults but to heal them <span
id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739.md) .  He came that He might cure every
weakness of our corruptness and all the sores of our defiled souls:  for
which reason it behoved Him to be born by a new order, who brought to
men’s bodies the new gift of unsullied purity.  For the uncorrupt nature
of Him that was born had to guard the primal virginity of the Mother,
and the infused power of the Divine Spirit had to preserve in
spotlessness and holiness that sanctuary which He had chosen for
Himself:  that Spirit (I say) who had determined to raise the fallen, to
restore the broken, and by overcoming the allurements of the flesh to
bestow on us in abundant measure the power of chastity:  in order that
the virginity which in others cannot be retained in child-bearing, might
be attained by them at their second birth.

<span id="ii.v.xi-p16"></span>III.  *Justice required that Satan should
be vanquished by <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p16.1"></span>God</span> made man.*

<span id="ii.v.xi-p17"></span>And, dearly beloved, this very fact that
Christ chose to be born of a Virgin does it not appear to be part of the
deepest design?  I mean, that the devil should not be aware that
Salvation had been born for the human race, and through the obscurity of
that spiritual conception, when he saw Him no different to others,
should believe Him born in no different way to others.  For when he
observed that His nature was like that of all others, he thought that He
had the same origin as all had:  and did not understand that He was free
from the bonds of transgression because he did not find Him a stranger
to the weakness of mortality.  For though the true <span
id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md) mercy of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p18.1"></span>God</span> had infinitely many schemes to hand
for the restoration of mankind, it chose that particular design which
put in force for destroying the devil’s work, not the efficacy of might
but the dictates of justice.  For the pride of the ancient foe not
undeservedly <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span
id="ii.v.xi-Page_131"></span>made good its despotic rights over all men,
and with no unwarrantable supremacy tyrannized over those who had been
of their own accord lured away from <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p18.2"></span>God’s</span> commands to be the slaves of his
will.  And so there would be no justice in his losing the immemorial
slavery of the human race, were he not conquered by that which he had
subjugated.  And to this end, without male seed Christ was conceived of
a Virgin, who was fecundated not by human intercourse but by the Holy
Spirit.  And whereas in all mothers conception does not take place
without stain of sin, this one received purification from the Source of
her conception.  For no taint of sin penetrated, where no intercourse
occurred.  Her unsullied virginity knew no lust when it ministered the
substance.  The <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p18.3"></span>Lord</span> took from His mother our nature,
not our fault <span id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741.md) .  The slave’s
form is created without the slave’s estate, because the New Man is so
commingled with the old, as both to assume the reality of our race and
to remove its ancient flaw.

<span id="ii.v.xi-p20"></span>IV.  *The Incarnation deceived the Devil
and caused him to break the bond under which he held men.*

<span id="ii.v.xi-p21"></span>When, therefore, the merciful and almighty
Saviour so arranged the commencement of His human course as to hide the
power of His Godhead which was inseparable from His manhood under the
veil of our weakness, the crafty foe was taken off his guard and he
thought that the nativity of the Child, Who was born for the salvation
of mankind, was as much subject to himself as all others are at their
birth.  For he saw Him crying and weeping, he saw Him wrapped in
swaddling clothes, subjected to circumcision, offering the sacrifice
which the law required.  And then he perceived in Him the usual growth
of boyhood, and could have had no doubt of His reaching man’s estate by
natural steps.  Meanwhile, he inflicted insults, multiplied injuries,
made use of curses, affronts, blasphemies, abuse, in a word, poured upon
Him all the force of his fury and exhausted all the varieties of trial: 
and knowing how he had poisoned man’s nature, had no conception that He
had no share in the first transgression Whose mortality he had
ascertained by so many proofs.  The unscrupulous thief and greedy robber
persisted in assaulting Him Who had nothing of His own, and in carrying
out the general sentence on original sin, went beyond the bond on which
he rested <span id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742.md) , and required the
punishment of iniquity from Him in Whom he found no fault.  And thus the
malevolent terms of the deadly compact are annulled, and through the
injustice of an overcharge the whole debt is cancelled.  The strong one
is bound by his own chains, and every device of the evil one recoils on
his own head.  When the prince of the world is bound, all that he held
in captivity is released <span id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md) .  Our
nature cleansed from its old contagion regains its honourable estate,
death is destroyed by death, nativity is restored by nativity:  since at
one and the same time redemption does away with slavery, regeneration
changes our origin, and faith justifies the sinner.

<span id="ii.v.xi-p24"></span>V.  *The Christian is exhorted to share in
the blessings of the Incarnation.*

<span id="ii.v.xi-p25"></span>Whoever then thou art that devoutly and
faithfully boastest of the Christian name, estimate this atonement at
its right worth.  For to thee who wast a castaway, banished from the
realms of paradise, dying of thy weary exile, reduced to dust and ashes,
without further hope of living, by the Incarnation of the Word was given
the power to return from afar to thy Maker, to recognize thy parentage,
to become free after slavery, to be promoted from being an outcast to
sonship:  so that, thou who wast born of corruptible flesh, mayest be
reborn by the Spirit of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p25.1"></span>God</span>, and obtain through grace what thou
hadst not by nature, and, if thou acknowledge thyself the son of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p25.2"></span>God</span> by the spirit of
adoption, dare to call <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p25.3"></span>God</span> Father.  Freed from the accusings
of a bad conscience, aspire to the kingdom of heaven, do <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p25.4"></span>God’s</span> will supported
by the Divine help, imitate the angels upon earth, feed on the strength
of immortal sustenance, fight fearlessly on the side of piety against
hostile temptations, and if thou keep thy allegiance <span
id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744.md) in the heavenly warfare, doubt not
that thou wilt be crowned for thy victory in the triumphant camp of the
Eternal King, when the resurrection that is prepared for the faithful
has raised thee to participate in the heavenly Kingdom.

<span id="ii.v.xi-p27"></span>VI.  *The festival has nothing to do with
sun-worship, as some maintain*.

<span id="ii.v.xi-p28"></span>Having therefore so confident a hope,
dearly beloved, abide firm in the Faith in which you are built:  lest
that same tempter whose <span id="page_132">p. 132</span> <span
id="ii.v.xi-Page_132"></span>tyranny over you Christ has already
destroyed, win you back again with any of his wiles, and mar even the
joys of the present festival by his deceitful art, misleading simpler
souls with the pestilential notion of some to whom this our solemn feast
day seems to derive its honour, not so much from the nativity of Christ
as, according to them, from the rising of the new sun <span
id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745.md) .  Such men’s hearts are wrapped in
total darkness, and have no growing perception of the true Light:  for
they are still drawn away by the foolish errors of heathendom, and
because they cannot lift the eyes of their mind above that which their
carnal sight beholds, they pay divine honour to the luminaries that
minister to the world.  Let not Christian souls entertain any such
wicked superstition and portentous lie.  Beyond all measure are things
temporal removed from the Eternal, things corporeal from the
Incorporeal, things governed from the Governor.  For though they possess
a wondrous beauty, yet they have no Godhead to be worshipped.  That
power then, that wisdom, that majesty is to be adored which created the
universe out of nothing, and framed by His almighty methods the
substance of the earth and sky into what forms and dimensions He
willed.  Sun, moon, and stars may be most useful to us, most fair to
look upon; but only if we render thanks to their Maker for them and
worship <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p29.1"></span>God</span> who
made them, not the creation which does Him service.  Then praise <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p29.2"></span>God</span>, dearly beloved,
in all His works and judgments.  Cherish an undoubting belief in the
Virgin’s pure conception.  Honour the sacred and Divine mystery of man’s
restoration with holy and sincere service.  Embrace Christ born in our
flesh, that you may deserve to see Him also as the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xi-p29.3"></span>God</span> of glory reigning
in His majesty, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit remains in the
unity of the Godhead for ever and ever.  Amen.
