<span id="iii.v.i.xxvii-p2"></span>*To Anthemius, Subdeacon* <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[1338](#fn_1337) .

<span id="iii.v.i.xxvii-p4"></span>Gregory to Anthemius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxvii-p5"></span>We charged thee on thy departure, and
remember to have afterwards enjoined on thee by letter, to take care of
the poor, and, if thou shouldest find any in those parts to be in want,
to inform me by letter:  and thou hast been at pains to do this with
regard to very few.  Now, I desire that, as soon as thou hast received
this present order, thou offer to Pateria, my father’s sister, forty
*solidi* for shoe-money for her boys, and four hundred *modii* of wheat;
to the lady Palatina, the widow of Urbicus, twenty *solidi* and three
hundred *modii* of wheat; to the lady Viviana, widow of Felix, twenty
*solidi* and three hundred *modii* of wheat.  And let all these eighty
*solidi* be charged together in thy accounts.  But bring hither with
speed the sum of thy receipts, and be here, with the <span

Easter Day.
