<span id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p2"></span>That the ruler should not set his
heart on pleasing men, and yet should give heed to what ought to please
them.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p3"></span>Meanwhile it is also necessary for
the ruler to keep wary watch, lest the lust of pleasing men assail him;
lest, when he studiously penetrates the things that are within, and
providently supplies the things that are without, he seek to be beloved
of those that are under him more than truth; lest, while, supported by
his good deeds, he seems not to belong to the world, self-love estrange
him from his Maker.  For he is the Redeemer’s enemy who through the good
works which he does covets being loved by the Church instead of Him;
since a servant whom the bridegroom has sent with gifts to the bride is
guilty of treacherous thought if he desires to please the eyes of the
bride.  And in truth this self-love, when it has got possession of a
ruler’s mind, sometimes carries it away inordinately to softness, but
sometimes to roughness.  For from love of himself the ruler’s mind is
inclined to softness, because, when he observes those that are under him
sinning, he does not presume to reprove them, lest their affection for
himself should grow dull; nay sometimes he smooths down with flatteries
the offence of his subordinates which he ought to have rebuked.  Hence
it is well said through the prophet, *Woe unto them that sew cushions
under every elbow, and make pillows under the head of every stature to
catch souls* ([Ezek. xiii. 18](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p3.1"></span>); inasmuch as to put cushions under
every elbow is to cherish with bland flatteries souls that are falling
from their uprightness and reclining themselves in this world’s
enjoyment.  For it is as though the elbow of a recumbent person rested
on a cushion and his head on pillows, when the hardness of reproof is
withdrawn from one who sins, and when the softness of favour is offered
to him, that he may lie softly in error, while no roughness of
contradiction troubles him.  But so rulers who love themselves
undoubtedly shew themselves to those by whom they fear they may be
injured in their pursuit of temporal glory.  Such indeed as they see to
have no power against them they ever keep down with roughness of rigid
censure, never admonish them gently, but, forgetful of pastoral
kindness, terrify them with the rights of domination.  Such the divine
voice rightly upbraids through the prophet, saying, *But with austerity
and power did ye rule them* ([Ezek. xxiv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p3.2"></span>).  For, loving themselves more than
their Maker, they lift up themselves haughtily towards those that are
under them, considering <span id="page_20b">p. 20b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii.viii-Page_20b"></span>not what they ought to do, but what
they can do; they have no fear of future judgment; they glory insolently
in temporal power; it pleases them to be free to do even unlawful
things, and that no one among their subordinates should contradict
them.  He, then, who sets his mind on doing wrong things, and yet wishes
all other men to hold their peace about them, is himself a witness to
himself that he desires to be loved himself more than the truth, which
he is unwilling should be defended against him.  There is indeed no one
who so lives as not to some extent to fail in duty.  He, then, desires
the truth to be loved more fully than himself, who wishes to be spared
by no one against the truth.  For hence Peter willingly accepted Paul’s
rebuke ([Galat. ii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p3.3"></span>); hence David humbly listened to the
reproof of his subject ([2 Sam. xii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p3.4"></span>); because good rulers, being
themselves unconscious of loving with partial affection, believe the
word of free sincerity from subjects to be the homage of humility.  But
meanwhile it is necessary that the care of government be tempered with
so great skill of management that the mind of subjects, when it has
become able to feel rightly on some subjects, should so advance to
liberty of speech that liberty still break not out into pride; lest,
while liberty of the tongue is perchance conceded to them overmuch, the
humility of their life be lost.  It is to be borne in mind also, that it
is right for good rulers to desire to please men; but this in order to
draw their neighbours by the sweetness of their own character to
affection for the truth; not that they should long to be themselves
loved, but should make affection for themselves as a sort of road by
which to lead the hearts of their hearers to the love of the Creator. 
For it is indeed difficult for a preacher who is not loved, however well
he may preach, to be willingly listened to.  He, then, who is over
others ought to study to be loved to the end that he may be listened to,
and still not seek love for its own sake, lest he be found in the hidden
usurpation of his thought to rebel against Him whom in his office he
appears to serve.  Which thing Paul insinuates well, when, manifesting
the secret of his affection for us, he says, *Even as I please all men
in all things* ([1 Cor. x. 33](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#033.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p3.5"></span>).  And yet he says again, *If I yet
pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ* ([Gal. i.
10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p3.6"></span>).  Thus Paul pleases, and pleases not;
because in that he desires to please he seeks that not he himself should
please men, but truth through him.
