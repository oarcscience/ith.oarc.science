<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p2"></span>How the whole and the sick are to be
admonished.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p3"></span>(*Admonition* 13.)  Differently to
be admonished are the whole and the sick.  For the whole are to be
admonished that they employ the health of the body to the health of the
soul:  lest, if they turn the grace of granted soundness to the use of
iniquity, they be made worse by the gift, and afterwards merit the
severer punishments, in that they fear not now to use amiss the more
bountiful gifts of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p3.1"></span>God</span>.  The whole are to be
admonished that they despise not the opportunity of winning health for
ever.  For it is written, *Behold now is the acceptable time, behold now
is the day of salvation* ([2 Cor. vi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p3.2"></span>).  They are to be admonished lest, if
they will not please <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p3.3"></span>God</span> when they may, they may be
not able when, too late, they would.  For hence it is that Wisdom
afterward deserts those whom, too long refusing, she before called,
saying, *I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand,
and no man regarded; ye have set at naught all my counsel, and would
none of my reproof:  I will also laugh at your destruction, and will
mock when what you feared cometh* ([Prov. i.
24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p3.4"></span>, *seq.*).  And again, *Then shall they
call upon me, and I will not hearken; they shall rise early, and shall
not find me* ([Prov. 1.28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p3.5"></span>).  And so, when health of body,
received for the purpose of doing good, is despised, it is felt, after
it is lost, how precious was the gift:  and at the last it is
fruitlessly sought, having been enjoyed unprofitably when granted at the
fit time.  Whence it is well said through Solomon, *Give not thine
honour unto aliens and thy years unto the cruel, lest haply strangers be
filled with thy wealth, and thy labours be in the house of a stranger,
and thou moan at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed*
([Prov. 5.9](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p3.6"></span>, *seq.*).  For who are aliens from us
but malignant spirits, who are separated from the lot of the heavenly
country?  And what is our honour but that, though made in bodies of
clay, we are yet created after the image and likeness of our Maker?  Or
who else is cruel but that apostate angel, who has both smitten himself
with the pain of death through pride, and has not spared, though lost,
to bring death upon the human race?  He therefore gives his honour unto
aliens who, being made after the image and likeness of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p3.7"></span>God</span>, devotes the
seasons of his life to the pleasures of malignant spirits.  He also
surrenders his years to the cruel one who spends the space of life
accorded him after the will of the ill-domineering adversary.  And in
the same place it is well added, *Lest haply strangers be filled with
thy wealth, and labours be in the house of a stranger.*  For whosoever,
through the healthy estate of body received by him, or the wisdom of
mind granted to him, labours not in the practice of virtues but in the
perpetration of vices, he by no means fills his own house, but the
habitations of strangers, with his wealth:  that is, he multiplies the
deeds of unclean spirits, and indeed so acts, in his luxuriousness or
his pride, as even to increase the number of the lost by the addition of
himself.  Further, it is well added, *And thou moan at the last, when
thy flesh and thy body are consumed.*  For, for the most part, the
health of the flesh which has been received is spent through vices: 
but, when it is suddenly withdrawn, when the flesh is worn with
afflictions, when the soul is already urged <span id="page_35b">p.
35b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-Page_35b"></span>to go forth, then
lost health, long enjoyed for ill, is sought again as though for living
well.  And then men moan for that they would not serve <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p3.8"></span>God</span>, when
altogether unable to repair the losses of their negligence by serving
Him.  Whence it is said in another place, *When He slew them, then they
sought Him* ([Ps. lxxvii. 34](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#034.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p3.9"></span>).

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p4"></span>But, on the other hand, the sick are
to be admonished that they feel themselves to be sons of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p4.1"></span>God</span> in that the
scourge of discipline chastises them.  For, unless He purposed to give
them an inheritance after correction, He would not have a care to
educate them by afflictions.  For hence the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p4.2"></span>Lord</span> says to John by the angel,
*Whom I love I rebuke and chasten* ([Rev.
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#019.md), [Prov.
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p4.3"></span>).  Hence again it is written, *My son
despise not thou the discipline of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p4.4"></span>Lord</span>, nor faint when thou art
rebuked of Him.  For whom the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p4.5"></span>Lord</span> loveth He chasteneth, and
scourgeth every son whom He receiveth* ([Heb.
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p4.6"></span>).  Hence the Psalmist says, *Many are
the tribulations of the righteous, and out of all these hath the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p4.7"></span>Lord</span> delivered
them* ([Ps. xxxiii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p4.8"></span>).  Hence also the blessed Job, crying
out in his sorrow, says, *If l be righteous, I will not lift up my head,
being saturated with affliction and misery* ([Job x.
15](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p4.9"></span>).  The sick are to be told that, if
they believe the heavenly country to be their own, they must needs
endure labours in this as in a strange land.  For hence it was that the
stones were hammered outside, that they might be laid without sound of
hammer in the building of the temple of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p4.10"></span>Lord</span>; because, that is, we are
now hammered with scourges without, that we may be afterwards set in our
places within, without stroke of discipline, in the temple of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p4.11"></span>God</span>; to the end
that strokes may now cut away whatever is superfluous in us, and then
the concord of charity alone bind us together in the building.  The sick
are to be admonished to consider what severe scourges of discipline
chastise our sons after the flesh for attaining earthly inheritances. 
What pain, then, of divine correction is hard upon us, by which both a
never-to-be-lost inheritance is attained, and punishments which shall
endure for ever are avoided?  For hence Paul says, *We have had fathers
of our flesh as our educators, and we gave them reverence:  shall we not
much more be in subjection unto the Father of spirits and live?  And
they indeed for a few days educated us after their own will; but He for
our profit in the receiving of His sanctification* ([Heb.
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p4.12"></span>).

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p5"></span>The sick are to be admonished to
consider how great health of the heart is in bodily affliction, which
recalls the mind to knowledge of itself, and renews the memory of
infirmity which health for the most part casts away, so that the spirit,
which is carried out of itself into elation, may be reminded by the
smitten flesh from which it suffers to what condition it is subject. 
Which thing is rightly signified to Balaam (had he but been willing to
follow obediently the voice of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p5.1"></span>God</span>) in the very retardation of
his journey ([Num. xxii. 23](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#023.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p5.2"></span>, *seq.*).  For Balaam is on his way to
attain his purpose; but the animal which is under him thwarts his
desire.  The ass, stopped by the prohibition, sees an angel which the
human mind sees not; because for the most part the flesh, slow through
afflictions, indicates to the mind from the scourge which it endures the
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p5.3"></span>God</span> whom
the mind itself which has the flesh under it did not see, in such sort
as to impede the eagerness of the spirit which desires to advance in
this world as though proceeding on a journey, until it makes known to it
the invisible one who stands in its way.  Whence also it is well said
through Peter, *He had the dumb beast of burden for a rebuke of his
madness, which speaking with a man’s voice forbade the foolishness of
the prophet* ([2 Pet. ii. 16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p5.4"></span>).  For indeed a man is rebuked as mad
by a dumb beast of burden, when an elated mind is reminded by the
afflicted flesh of the good of humility which it ought to retain.  But
Balaam did not obtain the benefit of this rebuke for this reason, that,
going to curse, he changed his voice, but not his mind.  The sick are to
be admonished to consider how great a boon is bodily affliction, which
both washes away committed sins and restrains those which might have
been committed, which inflicts on the troubled mind wounds of penitence
derived from outward stripes.  Whence it is written, *The blueness of a
wound cleanseth away evil, and stripes in the secret parts of the belly*
([Prov. xx. 30](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p5.5"></span>).  For the blueness of a wound
cleanseth away evil, because the pain of scourges cleanses iniquities,
whether meditated or perpetrated.  But by the appellation of belly the
mind is wont to be understood.  For that the mind is called the belly is
taught by that sentence in which it is written, *The spirit of man is
the lamp of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p5.6"></span>Lord</span>, which searcheth all the
secret parts of the belly* ([Prov.
20.27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p5.7"></span>).  As if to say, The illumination of
Divine inspiration, when it comes into a man’s mind, shews it to itself
by illuminating it, whereas before the coming of the Holy Spirit it both
could entertain bad thoughts and knew not how to estimate them.  Then,
the blueness of a wound cleanses away evil, and stripes in the secret
parts of the belly, because when we are smitten outwardly, we are
recalled, silent and afflicted, to memory of our sins, and bring back
before our eyes all our past evil deeds, and through what we suffer
outwardly we grieve inwardly the more for what we have done.  Whence it
comes to pass that in the <span id="page_36b">p. 36b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-Page_36b"></span>midst of open wounds of the body the
secret stripe in the belly cleanses us more fully, because a hidden
wound of sorrow heals the iniquities of evil-doing.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p6"></span>The sick are to be admonished, to
the end that they may keep the virtue of patience, to consider
incessantly how great evils our Redeemer endured from those whom He had
created; that He bore so many vile insults of reproach; that, while
daily snatching the souls of captives from the hand of the old enemy, He
took blows on the face from insulting men; that, while washing us with
the water of salvation, He hid not His face from the spittings of the
faithless; that, while delivering us by His advocacy from eternal
punishments, He bore scourges in silence; that, while giving to us
everlasting honours among the choirs of angels, He endured buffets;
that, while saving us from the prickings of our sins, He refused not to
submit His head to thorns; that, while inebriating us with eternal
sweetness, He accepted in His thirst the bitterness of gall; that He Who
for us adored the Father though equal to Him in Godhead, when adored in
mockery held His peace:  that, while preparing life for the dead, He Who
was Himself the life came even unto death.  Why, then, is it thought
hard that man should endure scourges from <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p6.1"></span>God</span> for evil-doing, if <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p6.2"></span>God</span> underwent so
great evils for well-doing?  Or who with sound understanding can be
ungrateful for being himself smitten, when even He Who lived here
without sin went not hence without a scourge?
