<span id="iii.v.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Epistle III.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.iii-p2"></span>*To John, Abbot* <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468.md) .

<span id="iii.v.iii.iii-p4"></span>Gregory to John, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iii.iii-p5"></span>Thy Love has requested me that
brother Boniface might be ordained Prior (*præpositus*) <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md) in thy monastery; as to which
request I wonder much why it has not been done before.  For since the
time when I caused him to be given to thee thou oughtest already to have
ordained him.

<span id="iii.v.iii.iii-p7"></span>With regard to the tunic of Saint
John <span id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470.md) , I have been altogether
gratified by thy anxiety to tell me of it.  But let thy Love endeavour
to send me this tunic, or (better still) this same bishop who has it,
with his clergy and with the tunic itself, to the end that we may enjoy
the blessing thereof, and be able to derive benefit from this bishop and
his clergy.  I have been desirous of putting an end to the cause that is
pending with Florianus, and have already advanced to him as much as
eighty *solidi*, which I believe he proposes should be given him in
compensation for the monastery’s debt; and I am altogether desirous that
this cause should be settled, inasmuch as Stephen the *chartularius* is
said to be urgent that the aforesaid Florianus should transfer it to
public cognizance, and it is distasteful to us to be engaged in a public
lawsuit.  Wherefore we must needs make some concession, so as to be able
to bring this same cause to a composition.  When this shall have been
done, we will inform your Love of it.

<span id="iii.v.iii.iii-p9"></span>But do thou give thy whole attention
to the souls of the brethren.  Let it be now enough that the reputation
of the monastery has been stained through your negligence.  Do not often
go abroad.  Appoint an agent for these causes, and do thou leave thyself
time for reading and prayer.

<span id="iii.v.iii.iii-p10"></span>Be attentive to hospitality; as far
as thou art able, give to the poor; yet so as to keep what ought to be
restored to Florianus.  Moreover, among the brethren of thy monastery
whom I see I do not find addiction to reading.  Wherefore you must needs
consider how great a sin it is, that <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.iii-p10.1"></span>God</span> should have sent you alimony
from the offerings of others, and you should neglect learning the
commandments of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.iii-p10.2"></span>God</span>.

<span id="iii.v.iii.iii-p11"></span>Further, with regard to the six
twelfths, unless we see the original deed, or a copy of it, we can do
nothing.  But I have sent an order to the servant of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iii.iii-p11.1"></span>God</span>,
Florentinus, that, if the truth should be made apparent to him, he
restore to you the six twelfths; after the restoration of which we will
either grant the remaining six twelfths on lease or commute the revenue.

<span id="iii.v.iii.iii-p8"></span> This tunic is referred to by John
the Deacon (*Vit. S. Greg*. iii. 57, 59), and supposed by him to have
been that of St. John the Evangelist, and identical with one of the
vestments afterwards preserved under the altar of St. John in the
*Basilica Constantiniana* at Rome, fragments of which he says were given
away as relics, and possessed of miraculous virtue.
