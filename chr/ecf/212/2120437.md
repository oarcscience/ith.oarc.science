<span id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p2"></span>To Hospito, Duke of the
Barbaricini <span id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541.md) .

<span id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p4"></span>Gregory to Hospito, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p5"></span>Since no one of thy race is a
Christian, I hereby know that thou art better than all thy race, in that
thou in it art found to be a Christian.  For, while all the Barbaricini
live as senseless animals, know not the true <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p5.1"></span>God</span>, but adore stocks and stones,
in the very fact that thou worshippest the true <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p5.2"></span>God</span> thou shewest how much thou
excellest them all.  But carry thou out the faith which thou hast
received in good deeds and words, and offer what is in thy power to
Christ in whom thou believest, so as to bring to Him as many as thou
canst, and cause them to be baptized, and admonish them to set their
affection on eternal life.  And if perchance thou canst not do this
thyself, being otherwise occupied, I beg thee, with my greeting, to
succour in all ways our men whom we have sent to your parts, to wit my
fellow-bishop Felix, and my son, the servant of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p5.3"></span>God</span>, Cyriacus <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542.md) , so that in aiding their labours
thou mayest shew thy devotion to Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p6.1"></span>God</span>, and that He whose servants
thou succourest in their good work may be a helper to thee in all good
deeds.  We have sent you through them a blessing <span
id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md) of St. Peter the apostle, which I
beg you to receive, as you ought to do, kindly.  The month of June,
Indiction 12.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p3"></span> The Barbaricini appear to have been a
native tribe in Sardinia, having its own duke, Zabardas (see *Ep*. 24)
being the duke of the island.

<span id="fn_1542"></span>[151b:1543](2120437.htm#fr_1542.md) <span
id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p5.4"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p6"></span> These two ecclesiastics had been sent
into Sardinia to promote the conversion of the natives, which seems to
have been remissly attended to, not only by the Christian lay
proprietors, but also by the bishops of the island.  See below, *Epp*.
25, 26.  The bishop Felix was not commissioned to supercede the ordinary
episcopal jurisdiction, but to act as a missionary bishop in aid.  Cf.
V. 41.

<span id="fn_1543"></span>[151b:1544](2120437.htm#fr_1543.md) <span
id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xvi-p7"></span> *Benedictio*, here as elsewhere,
means a present;—in this case, being said to be from St. Peter,
containing doubtless something that had acquired sanctity from him;
probably, as in other cases, filings from his chains.  Cf. I. 26, note
3.
