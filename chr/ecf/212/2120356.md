<span id="iii.v.ii.i-p3"></span>To Velox, Magister Militium.

<span id="iii.v.ii.i-p4"></span>Gregory to Velox, &c.

<span id="iii.v.ii.i-p5"></span>We informed your Glory some time ago
that soldiers had been prepared to come to your parts; but, inasmuch as
your letter had signified to us that the enemy were collected and were
marching hitherward, we for this reason have detained them here.  But
now it appears to be advantageous that a certain number of soldiers
should be sent to you, whom let thy Glory be careful to admonish and
exhort to be prepared for toil.  And, when you find an opportunity,
confer with our glorious sons Maurilius and Vitalianus, and do whatever,
with the help of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.i-p5.1"></span>God</span>, they may appoint you to do for
the advantage of the republic.  And, should you ascertain that the
unspeakable Ariulph <span id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394.md) is making
an incursion hitherward or to the parts about Ravenna, do you labour in
his rear, as becomes brave men, to the end that your renown may by <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.i-p6.1"></span>God’s</span> help advance
still more in the republic from the quality of your labour.  This,
however, before all, we admonish you to do:  to release without any
delay or excuse the family of Maloin and Adobin, Vigild and
Grussing <span id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395.md) , who are known to
be with the glorious *Magister militum* Maurilius, to the end that the
men of the aforesaid Maurilius, when they come to your parts, may
without any impediment march along with them.

<span id="iii.v.ii.i-p6"></span> Ariulph was the Lombard Duke of
Spoletum, one of the principal cities in Italy occupied by the
Lombards.  For further reference to him cf. II. 29, 30, 46; IX. 98.  He
was at this time preparing, and suspected by Gregory of such intention,
for an attack on Rome.  Cf. *Prologom*.  Velox (to whom this letter is
addressed), and Maurilius and Vitalian (alluded to in it, and addressed
in *Epp*. 29, 30), were Roman Generals (*magistri militum*) in command
of imperial forces:  but where they were is not apparent.  From an
allusion to Suana (or *Soana*) as within reach of the last two they may
be supposed to have been somewhere in Tuscia.

<span id="iii.v.ii.i-p7"></span> Apparently a *familia* of slaves
belonging to Velox, but at this time with Maurilius.
