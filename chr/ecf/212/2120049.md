<span id="ii.iv.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXIX.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxxix-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxix-p2.1"></span>To Flavian, Bishop of
Constantinople.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxxix-p3"></span>Leo, the bishop, to Flavian, the
bishop.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxix-p4"></span>He rebukes Flavian for not answering
his repeated letters.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxix-p5"></span>Our anxiety is increased by your
silence, for it is long now since we received a letter from you,
beloved:  while we who bear a chief share in your cares <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360) , through our anxiety for the defence
of the Faith, have several times <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361)
, as occasion served, sent letters to you:  that we might aid you with
the comfort of our exhortations not to yield to the assaults of your
adversaries in defence of the Faith, but to feel that we were the
sharers in your labour.  Some time since we believe our messengers have
reached you, brother, through whom you find yourself fully instructed by
our writings and injunctions, and we have ourselves sent back Basil to
you as you desired <span id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362) .  Now, lest
you should think we had omitted any opportunity of communicating with
you, we have sent this note by our son Eupsychius, a man whom we hold in
great honour and affection, asking you to reply to our letter with all
speed, and inform us at once about your own actions and those of our
representatives, and about the completion of the whole matter:  so that
we may allay the anxiety which we now feel in defence of the Faith, by
happier tidings.  Dated 11th August in the consulship of the illustrious
Asturius and Protogenes (449).
