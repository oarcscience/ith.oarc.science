<span id="iii.v.vi.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLVI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxviii-p2"></span>To Felix, Bishop of Pisaurum
(Pesaro).

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxviii-p3"></span>Gregory to Felix, Bishop, &c.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxviii-p4"></span>We wonder at your Fraternity, that,
disregarding the tenor of the precept given you by our predecessor of
holy memory, you should consecrate the monastery constructed by John,
the bearer of these presents, otherwise than as ancient use demands. 
For, while it is ordered among other things in the said precept that you
should dedicate the place itself without a public mass, still, as we
have heard, your chair has been placed there, and the sacred solemnities
of mass are there publicly celebrated.  If this is true, we hereby
exhort you that, putting aside all excuse, you cause your <span
id="page_202b">p. 202b</span> <span
id="iii.v.vi.xxviii-Page_202b"></span>chair to be altogether removed
thence, and that henceforth you perform no public masses there.  But, as
both custom and the tenor of the precept direct, if they should wish
mass to be celebrated for them there, let a presbyter be appointed by
thee for the purpose <span id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662.md) .

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxviii-p6"></span>Further, we desire that with the
favour of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxviii-p6.1"></span>God</span> there shall always remain a
congregation of servants of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxviii-p6.2"></span>God</span> in the same monastery, as
the aforesaid John has requested, and as is now the case.  As to the cup
also which he informs me has been taken away by your Fraternity, if it
be so, make haste to restore it.  These things, then, let your Holiness
so study to fulfil that the aforesaid bearer may have no need to resort
to us again on the same account.
