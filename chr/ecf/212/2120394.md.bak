<span id="iii.v.iii.viii-p4"></span>Gregory to Antoninus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iii.viii-p5"></span>It has come to our ears that
Florentius, bishop of the city of Epidaurus, his property having first
been seized, has been condemned, for certain crimes not proved, without
a sacerdotal council.  And, inasmuch as he ought not to suffer canonical
punishment, no canonical sentence having been pronounced for his
condemnation, we enjoin thy Experience to urge upon our brother and
fellow-bishop Natalis that he should cause the aforesaid man to be
recalled from the banishment into which he is said to have been driven. 
And a council of bishops having been assembled, if the charges brought
against him should be canonically proved, we will that the sentence of
our aforesaid brother and fellow-bishop Natalis shall take effect
against him.  But, should he be absolved by a general judgment, thou
must not permit him to be subject to prejudice on the part of any one,
and must carefully and rigorously insist on his aforesaid property being
restored to him.  It is therefore needful that the heavier thou feelest
the burden of such negotiations to be, with the maturer and more
vigilant execution thou take pains to fulfil them.

<span id="iii.v.iii.viii-p3"></span> I.e. of Dalmatia.  The case
referred to in this and the preceding letter is interesting as
illustrating canonical procedure against incriminated bishops.  Natalis
as Metropolitan, had entertained a charge against one of his suffragans
and pronounced judgment against him on his own authority.  Gregory
insists that he had no right to do so except in a synod of bishops.  It
appears that Natalis (as to whose character and relations to Gregory,
see II. 18, and *reff*. in note), paid no regard in this instance to the
pope’s remonstrances, and the latter found no means of enforcing his
orders.  For, in a letter written five years later (<span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iii.viii-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 597), long
after the death of Natalis, we find Gregory writing, “The inhabitants of
the city of Epidaurus have most urgently demanded that Florentius, who
they say is their bishop, should be restored to them by us, asserting
that he had been driven into exile invalidly by the mere will of the
bishop Natalis.”  (*Lib*. viii. *Indict*. i. *Ep*. 11).
