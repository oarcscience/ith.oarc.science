<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p2"></span>*To Columbus, Bishop* <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md) .

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p4"></span>Gregory to Columbus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p5"></span>It is known, most dear brother in
Christ, that the ancient enemy, who by cunning persuasion deposed the
first man from the delights of Paradise to this life of care, and in him
even then inflicted the penalty of mortality on the human race, does now
with the same cunning, so as more easily to seize the flock, endeavour
to infect the shepherds of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p5.1"></span>Lord’s</span> sheep with infused poisons,
and already to claim them as his own by right.  But we, who, though
unworthy, have undertaken the government of the Apostolic See in the
stead of Peter the prince of the apostles, are compelled by the very
office of our pontificate to resist the general enemy by all the efforts
in our power.  Now the bearers of these presents, Constantius and
Mustellus, have in a petition presented to us given us to understand,
and the deacons of the Church of Pudentiana constituted in the province
of Numidia assert, that Maximianus, prelate of the same Church,
corrupted by a bribe from the Donatists, has by a new licence allowed a
bishop to be made in the place where he lives; which thing, though
previous usage allowed it, <span id="page_116b">p. 116b</span> <span
id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-Page_116b"></span>is prohibited from remaining and
continuing by the catholic faith <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456.md) .  On this account, then, we have
deemed it necessary to exhort thy Fraternity by these present writings
that, when Hilarus our *chartularius* comes to thee, this same case be
subjected to a thorough and wise investigation in an united general
council of bishops, having the terror of the coming judge before their
eyes.  And if this charge should be proved with sufficient evidences by
the bearers of these presents against the aforesaid bishop, let him by
all means be degraded from the dignity and office which he enjoys, that
both he may return to the gains of penitence through acknowledgment of
his fault, and others may not presume to attempt such things.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p7"></span>For it is right that one who has sold
our <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p7.1"></span>Lord</span>
Jesus Christ to a heretic for money received, as is said to have been
done, should be removed from handling the mysteries of His most holy
body and blood.  Further, if, apart from this accusation, there is any
contest afoot among them, as is contained in the petition of the deacons
themselves, with respect to certain wrongs or private transactions, this
let thy Fraternity with our aforesaid *chartularius* fully enquire into
with evidence adduced, and decide it according to justice between all
the parties.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p8"></span>But, further, we have learnt through
the information given us by the bearers of these presents that the
heresy of the Donatists is for our sins spreading daily, and that very
many, leave being given them through venality, are being baptized a
second time by the Donatists.  How serious a matter this is, brother, it
behoves us with the whole bent of our minds to consider.  Lo, the wolf
tears the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p8.1"></span>Lord’s</span> flock, no longer stealthily
in the night, but in the open light; and we see him advance in the
slaughter of the sheep, and with no solicitude, with no darts of words,
do we oppose him.  What fruits, then, of a multiplied flock shall we
shew to the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p8.2"></span>Lord</span>, if even that of which we
have undertaken the feeding we see with easy mind mangled by the wild
beast?  Let us therefore study to inflame our hearts by imitation of
earthly shepherds, who often keep watch through winter nights, pinched
with showers and frost, lest even one sheep, and perchance not a
profitable one, should perish.  And, if the prowler should have bitten
it with greedy mouth, how do they busy themselves, with what
palpitations of heart do they pant, with what cries do they leap forward
to rescue the captured sheep, stimulated by the pressing need, lest
anything lost through their carelessness should be required of them by
the <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p8.3"></span>Lord</span> of
the flock!  Let us then watch, lest anything should perish:  and, if
anything should by chance have been seized, let us bring it back to the
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p8.4"></span>Lord’s</span>
flock by the cries of divine discourses, that He who is the Shepherd of
shepherds may mercifully vouchsafe to approve us in His judgment as
having kept watch over His sheepfold.  This also it is needful for you
to attend to wisely; that, if there should be any proper petition on the
part of the same bishop against the bearers of these presents, it should
be thoroughly enquired into; and, if haply they themselves also should
rightly deserve to be smitten for their own fault, we pronounce that
they should by no means be spared on the ground of their having had the
toil of resorting to us.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p9"></span>In the month of August, tenth
indiction.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p3"></span> This Columbus was one of the bishops
in Numidia, who seems to have enjoyed the peculiar confidence of
Gregory, being written to on various questions concerning the Church
there, and charged with seeing to the exercise of discipline over other
bishops, though not himself the primate.  He is addressed (III. 68;
VIII. 13) as being himself especially devoted to the Roman See.  Other
letters addressed to him are III. 48; IV. 35; VI. 37; VII. 2; VIII. 28;
XII. 8; XII. 28.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvi-p6"></span> The Donatists had formerly been
allowed their own bishop, tolerated along with the Catholic ones.  This
liberty was now disallowed, probably in accordance with imperial
edicts.  See I. 74, note 8.
