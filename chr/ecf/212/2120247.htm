<p class="c30"><a name="iii.iv.iii.i-p4"></A>How one who has in due order arrived at a place of rule ought to demean himself in it.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.iv.iii.i-p5"></A>The conduct of a prelate ought so far to transcend the conduct of the people as the life of a shepherd is wont to exalt him above the flock.&#160; For one whose estimation is such that the people are called his flock is bound anxiously to consider what great necessity is laid upon him to maintain rectitude.&#160; It is necessary, then, that in thought he should be pure, in action chief; discreet in keeping silence, profitable in speech; a near neighbour to every one in sympathy, exalted above all in contemplation; a familiar friend of good livers through humility, unbending against the vices of evil-doers through zeal for righteousness; not relaxing in his care for what is inward from being occupied in outward things, nor neglecting to provide for outward things in his solicitude for what is inward.&#160; But the things which we have thus briefly touched on let us now unfold and discuss more at length.</p>
