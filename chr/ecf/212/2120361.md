id="iii.v.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.vi-p2"></span>To Castorius, Bishop of Ariminum.

<span id="iii.v.ii.vi-p3"></span>Gregory to Castorius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.ii.vi-p4"></span>The illustrious lady Timothea has
intimated to us by a petitionary notification, as is set forth below,
that she has founded an oratory within the city of Ariminum in a place
belonging to her, which she desires to have consecrated in honour of the
holy cross.  And, accordingly, dearest brother, if the said construction
is in the jurisdiction of thy city, and if it is known that no body has
been buried there, then, after reception in the first place of a
legitimate endowment, that is, of two-thirds of her whole property
(excepting slaves), of her movables and fixtures and live stock, the
usufract being reserved to her for her life, and such endowment having
been secured by municipal deeds, thou wilt solemnly consecrate the
aforesaid oratory without any public mass, on the condition that no
baptistery shall be constructed in the same place in future times, and
that thou appoint not a cardinal presbyter <span
id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402.md) .  And if perchance she should
prefer having masses said there, let her know that she must ask thy Love
for a presbyter, to the end nothing else may be presumed by any other
priest whatever.  Further, thou wilt reverently deposit the holy
things <span id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403.md) she has provided.
