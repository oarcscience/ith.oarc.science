<p><a name="iii.v.ii.vii-p4"></A>I appointed thy Fraternity to preside for the present over the church of Naples, to the end that thou mightest convert all thou canst to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.vii-p4.1"></A>God</span> by persuasive preaching.&#160; And, while thou oughtest to be giving thy whole mind to this work, thou art in haste to return before bringing forth this fruit to the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.vii-p4.2"></A>Lord</span>, and requestest me to settle the affairs of this same church speedily, my mind being meanwhile by no means unoccupied in this matter.&#160; But, being desirous of fortifying securely the well-being of this Church, I hold it needful to consider the matter with long continued deliberation, so as to be able to arrange its affairs by the ordination of a worthy whom Christ may reveal to us.&#160; Wherefore let thy Fraternity meanwhile study to watch for the good of souls, so that the opinion I have of thee may be strengthened by the effect of thy working.&#160; All thou hast written concerning the deacon Peter has now been made known to us by the ex-consul Theodorus.&#160; And so, now that I know that he is constant to thee, and, according to thy testimony, studies the advantage of the Church, he ought to be afraid of no one&#146;s opposition or enmity, but persevere in benefiting the Church and serving <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.vii-p4.3"></A>God</span> all the more watchfully as he feels that others have a grudge against him; that so they may have no power at all to injure him.&#160; Moreover, thy Fraternity ought not hereafter to be suspected with regard to him; since no surreptitious proceedings will have effect on me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1404"></A><A HREF="#fn_1404"><FONT SIZE="1">1405</FONT></A>
