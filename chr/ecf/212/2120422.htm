<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.iv.i-p3"></A>To Constantius, Bishop.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iv.i-p4"></A>Gregory to Constantius, Bishop of Mediolanum (<i>Milan</i>).</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.i-p5"></A>On receiving the letters of your Fraternity I returned great thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.i-p5.1"></A>God</span>, that I was counted worthy to be refreshed by the celebration of your ordination.&#160; Truly that all, by the gift of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.i-p5.2"></A>God</span>, with one accord concurred in your election, is a fact which thy Fraternity ought with the utmost consideration to estimate, since, after <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.i-p5.3"></A>God</span>, you are greatly indebted to those who with so submissive a disposition desired you to be preferred before themselves.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.i-p6"></A>It becomes you, therefore, with priestly benignity to respond to their behaviour, and with kind sympathy to attend to their needs.&#160; If perchance there are any faults in any of them, rebuke these with well-considered reproofs, so that your very priestly indignation be mingled with a savour of sweetness, and that so you may be loved by your subjects even when you are greatly feared.&#160; Such conduct will also induce great reverence for your person in their judgment; since, as hasty and habitual rage is despised, so discriminate indignation against faults for the most part becomes the formidable in proportion as it has been slow.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.i-p7"></A>Further, John our subdeacon, who has returned, has reported many good things of you as to which we beseech Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.i-p7.1"></A>God</span> Himself to fulfil what He has begun; to the end that He may shew thee to have advanced in good inwardly and outwardly both now among men and hereafter among the angels.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.i-p8"></A>Moreover, we have sent thee, according to custom, a pallium to be used in the sacred solemnities of mass.&#160; But I beg you, when you receive it, to vindicate its dignity and its meaning by humility.</p>
