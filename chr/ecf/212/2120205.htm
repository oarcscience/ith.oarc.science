<p class="c26"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p2"></A><span class="c4"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p2.1"></A>On the Passion, III.; delivered on the Sunday before Easter.</span></p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p3"></A>I.&#160; <i>The two-fold nature of Christ set forth.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p4"></A>Among all the works of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p4.1"></A>God&#146;s</span> mercy, dearly-beloved, which from the beginning have been bestowed upon men&#146;s salvation, none is more wondrous, and none more sublime, than that Christ was crucified for the world.&#160; For to this mystery all the mysteries of the ages preceding led up, and every variation which the will of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p4.2"></A>God</span> ordained in sacrifices, in prophetic signs, and in the observances of the Law, foretold that this was fixed, and promised its fulfilment:&#160; so that now types and figures are at an end, and we find our profit in believing that accomplished which before we found our profit in looking forward to.&#160; In all things, therefore, dearly-beloved, which pertain to the Passion of our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p4.3"></A>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, the Catholic Faith maintains and demands that we acknowledge the two Natures to have met in our Redeemer, and while their properties remained, such a union of both Natures to have been effected that, from the time when, as the cause of mankind required, in the blessed Virgin&#146;s womb, &#8220;the Word became flesh,&#8221; we may not think of Him as <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p4.4"></A>God</span> without that which is man, nor as man without that which is <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p4.5"></A>God</span>.&#160; Each Nature does indeed express its real existence by actions that distinguish it, but neither separates itself from connexion with the other.&#160; Nothing is wanting there on either side; in the majesty the humility is complete, in the humility the majesty is complete:&#160; and the unity does not introduce confusion, nor does the distinctiveness destroy the unity.&#160; The one is passible, the other inviolable; and yet the degradation belongs to the same Person, as does the glory.&#160; He is present at once in weakness and in power; at once capable of death and the vanquisher of it.&#160; Therefore, <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p4.6"></A>God</span> took on Him whole Manhood, and so blended the two Natures together by means of His mercy and power, that each Nature was present in the other, and neither passed out of its own properties into the other.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p5"></A>II.&#160; <i>The two natures acted conjointly, and the human sufferings were not compulsory, but in accordance with the Divine will.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p6"></A>But because the design of that mystery which was ordained for our restoration before the eternal ages, was not to be carried out without human weakness and without Divine power&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_972"></A><A HREF="#fn_972"><FONT SIZE="1">973</FONT></A>
, both &#8220;form&#8221; does that which is proper to it in common with the other, the Word, that is, performing that which is the Word&#146;s and the flesh that which is of the flesh.&#160; One of them gleams bright with miracles, the other succumbs to injuries.&#160; The one departs not from equality with the Father&#146;s glory, the other leaves not the nature of our race.&#160; But nevertheless even His very endurance of sufferings does not so far expose Him to a participation in our humility as to separate Him from the power of the Godhead.&#160; All the mockery and insults, all the persecution and pain which the madness of the wicked inflicted on the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p7.1"></A>Lord</span>, was not endured of necessity, but undertaken of free-will:&#160; &#8220;for the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which had perished&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_973"></A><A HREF="#fn_973"><FONT SIZE="1">974</FONT></A>
:&#8221;&#160; and He used the wickedness of His persecutors for the redemption of all men in such a way that in the mystery of His Death and Resurrection even His murderers could have been saved, if they had believed.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p9"></A>III.&#160; <i>Judas&#146; infamy has never been exceeded.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p10"></A>And hence, Judas, thou art proved more criminal and unhappier than all; for when repentance should have called thee back to the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p10.1"></A>Lord</span>, despair dragged thee to the halter.&#160; Thou shouldest have awaited the completion of thy crime, and have put off thy ghastly death by hanging, until Christ&#146;s Blood was shed for all sinners.&#160; And among the many miracles and gifts of the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p10.2"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> which might have aroused thy conscience, those holy mysteries, at least, might have rescued thee from thy headlong fall, which at the Paschal supper thou hadst received, being even then detected in thy treachery by the sign of Divine knowledge.&#160; Why dost thou  <A NAME="page_166"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 166</FONT></A> <a name="ii.v.xxvii-Page_166"></A>distrust the goodness of Him, Who did not repel thee from the communion of His body and blood, Who did not deny thee the kiss of peace when thou camest with crowds and a band of armed men to seize Him.&#160; But O man that nothing could convert, O &#8220;spirit going and not returning&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_974"></A><A HREF="#fn_974"><FONT SIZE="1">975</FONT></A>
,&#8221; thou didst follow thy heart&#146;s rage, and, the devil standing at thy right hand, didst turn the wickedness, which thou hadst prepared against the life of all the saints, to thine own destruction, so that, because thy crime had exceeded all measure of punishment, thy wickedness might make thee thine own judge, thy punishment allow thee to be thine own hangman.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p12"></A>IV.&#160; <i>Christ voluntarily bartered His glory for our weakness.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p13"></A>When, therefore, &#8220;<span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p13.1"></A>God</span> was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_975"></A><A HREF="#fn_975"><FONT SIZE="1">976</FONT></A>
,&#8221; and the Creator Himself was wearing the creature which was to be restored to the image of its Creator; and after the Divinely-miraculous works had been performed, the performance of which the spirit of prophecy had once predicted, &#8220;then shall the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf shall hear; then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be plain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_976"></A><A HREF="#fn_976"><FONT SIZE="1">977</FONT></A>
;&#8221; Jesus knowing that the time was now come for the fulfilment of His glorious Passion, said, &#8220;My soul is sorrowful even unto death&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_977"></A><A HREF="#fn_977"><FONT SIZE="1">978</FONT></A>
;&#8221; and again, &#8220;Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_978"></A><A HREF="#fn_978"><FONT SIZE="1">979</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; And these words, expressing a certain fear, show His desire to heal the affection of our weakness by sharing them, and to check our fear of enduring pain by undergoing it.&#160; In our Nature, therefore, the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p17.2"></A>Lord</span> trembled with our fear, that He might fully clothe our weakness and our frailty with the completeness of His own strength.&#160; For He had come into this world a rich and merciful Merchant from the skies, and by a wondrous exchange had entered into a bargain of salvation with us, receiving ours and giving His, honour for insults, salvation for pain, life for death:&#160; and He Whom more than 12,000 of the angel-hosts might have served&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_979"></A><A HREF="#fn_979"><FONT SIZE="1">980</FONT></A>
 for the annihilation of His persecutors, preferred to entertain our fears, rather than employ His own power.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p19"></A>V<i>.&#160; S. Peter was the first to benefit by his Master&#146;s humiliation.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p20"></A>And how much this humiliation conferred upon all the faithful, the most blessed Apostle Peter was the first to prove, who, after the fierce blast of threatening cruelty had dismayed him, quickly changed, and was restored to vigour, finding remedy from the great Pattern, so that the suddenly-shaken member returned to the firmness of the Head.&#160; For the bond-servant could not be &#8220;greater than the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p20.1"></A>Lord</span>, nor the disciple greater than the master&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_980"></A><A HREF="#fn_980"><FONT SIZE="1">981</FONT></A>
,&#8221; and he could not have vanquished the trembling of human frailty had not the Vanquisher of Death first feared.&#160; The <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p21.2"></A>Lord</span>, therefore, &#8220;looked back upon Peter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_981"></A><A HREF="#fn_981"><FONT SIZE="1">982</FONT></A>
,&#8221; and amid the calumnies of priests, the falsehoods of witnesses, the injuries of those that scourged and spat upon Him, met His dismayed disciple with those eyes wherewith He had foreseen his dismay:&#160; and the gaze of the Truth entered into him, on whose heart correction must be wrought, as if the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p22.2"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> voice were making itself heard there, and saying, Whither goest thou, Peter? why retirest thou upon thyself? turn thou to Me, put thy trust in Me, follow Me:&#160; this is the time of My Passion, the hour of thy suffering is not yet come.&#160; Why dost thou fear what thou, too, shalt overcome?&#160; Let not the weakness, in which I share, confound thee.&#160; I was fearful for thee; do thou be confident of Me.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p23"></A>VI.&#160; <i>The mad counsel of the Jews was turned to their own destruction.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p24"></A>&#8220;And when morning was come all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_982"></A><A HREF="#fn_982"><FONT SIZE="1">983</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; This morning, O ye Jews, was for you not the rising, but the setting of the sun, nor did the wonted daylight visit your eyes, but a night of blackest darkness brooded on your naughty hearts.&#160; This morning overthrew for you the temple and its altars, did away with the Law and the Prophets, destroyed the Kingdom and the priesthood, turned all your feasts into eternal mourning.&#160; For ye resolved on a mad and bloody counsel, ye &#8220;fat bulls,&#8221; ye &#8220;many oxen,&#8221; ye &#8220;roaring&#8221; wild beasts, ye rabid &#8220;dogs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_983"></A><A HREF="#fn_983"><FONT SIZE="1">984</FONT></A>
,&#8221; to give up to death the Author of life and the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p26.2"></A>Lord</span> of glory; and, as if the enormity of your fury could be palliated by employing the verdict of him, who ruled your province, you lead Jesus bound to Pilate&#146;s judgment, that the terror-stricken judge being overcome by your persistent shouts, you might choose a man that was a murderer for pardon, and demand the crucifixion of the Saviour of the world.&#160; After this condemnation of Christ, brought about more by the cowardice than the power of Pilate, who with  <A NAME="page_167"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 167</FONT></A> <a name="ii.v.xxvii-Page_167"></A>washed hands but polluted mouth sent Jesus to the cross with the very lips that had pronounced Him innocent, the licence of the people, obedient to the looks of the priests, heaped many insults on the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p26.3"></A>Lord</span>, and the frenzied mob wreaked its rage on Him, Who meekly and voluntarily endured it all.&#160; But because, dearly-beloved, the whole story is too long to go through to-day, let us put off the rest till Wednesday, when the reading of the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p26.4"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> Passion will be repeated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_984"></A><A HREF="#fn_984"><FONT SIZE="1">985</FONT></A>
.&#160; For the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p27.1"></A>Lord</span> will grant to your prayers, that of His own free gift we may fulfil our promise:&#160; through our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxvii-p27.2"></A>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, Who liveth and reigneth for ever and ever.&#160; Amen.</p>
