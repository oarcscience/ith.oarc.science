id="iii.v.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Epistle II.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.ii-p2"></span>*To Paulus, Bishop* <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467) .

<span id="iii.v.iii.ii-p4"></span>Gregory to Paulus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iii.ii-p5"></span>Although it has distressed us in no
slight degree to hear of the injury that thou hast suffered, yet we have
matter of consolation in learning that the affair is to thy credit, in
that, so far as the account sent to us has disclosed the facts, thou
hast suffered in the cause of uprightness and equity.  Wherefore, that
it may redound to the greater glory of thy Fraternity, this occurrence
ought neither to shake thy constancy nor turn thee aside from the way of
truth.  For it is to the greater reward of priests if they continue in
the path of truth even after injuries.  But, lest the madness of such
great impiety should remain unpunished, and pernicious insubordination
break out to a worse degree, we have enjoined the magnificent
Scholasticus, judge of Campania, who is at present here, that he should
avenge what has been done with the repression it deserves.  But,
inasmuch as thy men have requested us to commission some one to
represent ourselves, know that we have for this reason sent to Naples
the subdeacon Epiphanius, who may <span id="page_123b">p. 123b</span>
<span id="iii.v.iii.ii-Page_123b"></span>be able, with the judge above
named, to investigate and ascertain the truth, to the end that by his
instancy he may cause worthy vengeance to be executed on those who may
be shewn to have instigated or perpetrated so great a crime.
