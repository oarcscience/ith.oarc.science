<span id="iii.v.v.x"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.x-p1.1"></span>Epistle XX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p2"></span>To Mauricius Augustus.

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p3"></span>Gregory to Mauricius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p4"></span>Our most pious and God-appointed lord,
among his other august cares and burdens, watches also in the
uprightness of spiritual zeal over the preservation of peace among the
priesthood, inasmuch as he piously and truly considers that no one can
govern earthly things aright unless he knows how to deal with divine
things, and that the peace of the republic hangs on the peace of the
universal Church.  For, most serene <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.x-p4.1"></span>Lord</span>, what human power, and what
strength of fleshly arm would presume to lift irreligious hands against
the lofty height of your most Christian Empire, if the concordant hearts
of priests were studious to implore their Redeemer for you with the
tongue, and also, as they ought to do, by their deservings?  Or what
sword of a most savage race would advance with so great cruelty to the
slaughter of the faithful, unless the life <span id="page_170b">p.
170b</span> <span id="iii.v.v.x-Page_170b"></span>of us, who are called
priests but are not, were weighed down by works most wicked.  But while
we neglect the things that concern us, and think of those that concern
us not, we associate our sins with the barbaric forces and our fault,
which weighs down the forces of the republic, sharpens the swords of the
enemy.  But what shall we say for ourselves, who press down the people
of <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.x-p4.2"></span>God</span> which we
are unworthily set over with the loads of our sins; who destroy by
example what we preach with the tongue; who by our works teach
unrighteous things, and with our voice only set forth the things that
are righteous?  Our bones are worn down by fasts, and in our mind we
swell.  Our body is covered with vile raiment, and in elation of heart
we surpass the purple.  We lie in ashes, and look down upon loftiness. 
Teachers of humility, we are chiefs of pride; behind the faces of sheep
we hide the teeth of wolves <span id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590.md)
.  But what is the end of these things except that we persuade men, but
are manifest to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.x-p5.1"></span>God</span>?  Wherefore most providently for
restraining warlike movements does the most pious lord seek the peace of
the Church, and, for compacting it, deigns to bring back the hearts of
its priests to concord.  And this indeed is what I wish; and, as far as
I am concerned, I render obedience to his most serene commands.  But
since it is not my cause, but <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.x-p5.2"></span>God’s</span>, since the pious laws, since the
venerable synods, since the very commands of our <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.x-p5.3"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ are disturbed by the
invention of a certain proud and pompous phrase, let the most pious lord
cut the place of the sore, and bind the resisting patient in the chains
of august authority.  For in binding up these things tightly you relieve
the republic; and while you cut off such things, you provide for the
lengthening of your reign.

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p6"></span>For to all who know the Gospel it is
apparent that by the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.x-p6.1"></span>Lord’s</span> voice the care of the whole
Church was committed to the holy Apostle and Prince of all the Apostles,
Peter.  For to him it is said, *Peter, lovest thou Me? Feed My sheep*
([John xxi. 17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.x-p6.2"></span>).  To him it is said, *Behold Satan hath
desired to sift you as wheat; and I have prayed for thee, Peter, that
thy faith fail not.  And thou, when thou art converted, strengthen thy
brethren* ([Luke xxii. 31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.x-p6.3"></span>).  To him it is said, *Thou art Peter, and
upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell shall not
prevail against it.  And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind an earth shall be bound also in
heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed also in
heaven* ([Matth. xvi. 18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.x-p6.4"></span>).

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p7"></span>Lo, he received the keys of the heavenly
kingdom, and power to bind and loose is given him, the care and
principality of the whole Church is committed to him, and yet he is not
called the universal apostle; while the most holy man, my fellow-priest
John, attempts to be called universal bishop.  I am compelled to cry out
and say, *O tempora, O mores!*

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p8"></span>Lo, all things in the regions of Europe
are given up into the power of barbarians, cities are destroyed, camps
overthrown, provinces depopulated, no cultivator inhabits the land,
worshippers of idols rage and dominate daily for the slaughter of the
faithful, and yet priests, who ought to lie weeping on the ground and in
ashes, seek for themselves names of vanity, and glory in new and profane
titles.

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p9"></span>Do I in this matter, most pious lord,
defend my own cause?  Do I resent my own special wrong?  Nay, the cause
of Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.x-p9.1"></span>God</span>, the cause of the Universal
Church.

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p10"></span>Who is this that, against the
evangelical ordinances, against the decrees of canons, presumes to usurp
to himself a new name?  Would indeed that one by himself he were, if he
could be without any lessening of others,—he that covets to be
universal.

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p11"></span>And certainly we know that many priests
of the Constantinopolitan Church have fallen into the whirlpool of
heresy, and have become not only heretics, but even heresiarchs.  For
thence came Nestorius, who, thinking Jesus Christ, the Mediator of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.x-p11.1"></span>God</span> and men, to be
two persons, because he did not believe that <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.x-p11.2"></span>God</span> could be made man, broke out even
into Jewish perfidy.  Thence came Macedonius, who denied that <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.x-p11.3"></span>God</span> the Holy Spirit
was consubstantial with the Father and the Son.  If then any one in that
Church takes to himself that name, whereby he makes himself the head of
all the good, it follows that the Universal Church falls from its
standing (which <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.x-p11.4"></span>God</span> forbid), when he who is called
Universal falls.  But far from Christian hearts be that name of
blasphemy, in which the honour of all priests is taken away, while it is
madly arrogated to himself by one.

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p12"></span>Certainly, in honour of Peter, Prince of
the apostles, it was offered by the venerable synod of Chalcedon to the
Roman pontiff <span id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591.md) .  But none of
them has ever consented to use this name of singularity, lest, by
something being given peculiarly to one, priests in general should be
deprived of the honour due to them.  How is it then that we do not seek
the glory of this title even when offered, and another <span
id="page_171b">p. 171b</span> <span
id="iii.v.v.x-Page_171b"></span>presumes to seize it for himself though
not offered?

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p14"></span>He, then, is rather to be bent by the
mandate of our most pious Lords, who scorns to render obedience to
canonical injunctions.  He is to be coerced, who does wrong to the holy
Universal Church, who swells in heart, who covets rejoicing in a name of
singularity, who also puts himself above the dignity of your Empire
through a title peculiar to himself.

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p15"></span>Behold, we all suffer offence for this
thing.  Let then the author of the offence be brought back to a right
way of life; and all quarrels of priests will cease.  For I for my part
am the servant of all priests, so long as they live as becomes priests. 
For whosoever, through the swelling of vain glory, lifts up his neck
against Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.x-p15.1"></span>God</span> and against the statutes of the
Fathers, I trust in Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.x-p15.2"></span>God</span> that he will not bend my neck to
himself, not even with swords.

<span id="iii.v.v.x-p16"></span>Moreover what has been done in this city
on our hearing of this title, I have indicated in full to my deacon and
*responsalis* Sabinianus.  Let then the piety of my lords think of me as
their own, whom they have always cherished and countenanced beyond
others, and who desire to render obedience to you and yet fear to be
found guilty in the heavenly and tremendous judgment, and, according to
the petition of the aforesaid deacon Sabinianus, let my most pious lord
either deign to judge this business, or to move the often before
mentioned man to desist at length from this attempt.  If then through
the most just judgment of your Piety he should comply with your orders,
even though they be mild ones, we shall return thanks to Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.x-p16.1"></span>God</span>, and rejoice for
the peace granted through you to all the Church.  But should he persist
any longer in his present contention, we hold this sentence of the Truth
to be already made good; *Every one that exalteth himself shall be
humbled* ([Luke 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#011.md), [Luke
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.x-p16.2"></span>).  And again it is written, *Before a fall
the heart is lifted up* ([Prov. xvi.
18](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.x-p16.3"></span>).  I however, rendering obedience to the
commands of my lords, have both written sweetly to my aforesaid
fellow-priest, and humbly admonished him to amend himself of this
coveting of empty glory.  If therefore he be willing to hear me, he has
a devoted brother.  But, if he persists in pride, I already see what
will follow:—that he will find Him as his adversary of whom it is
written, *<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.x-p16.4"></span>God</span>
resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble* ([Jam. iv.
6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006)<span id="iii.v.v.x-p16.5"></span>.md).
