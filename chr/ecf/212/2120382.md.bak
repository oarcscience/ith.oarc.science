<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLIX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvii-p2"></span>To Januarius, Archbishop.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvii-p3"></span>Gregory to Januarius, archbishop of
Caralis (Cagliari).

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvii-p4"></span>If with integrity of heart we
consider the priestly office which we administer, the concord of
personal charity ought so to unite us with our sons that, as we are
fathers in name, so we should be proved by our affection to be so in
deed.  While, then, we ought to be such as has been said above, we
wonder why such a mass of complaints has arisen against thy Fraternity. 
We still indeed hesitate to believe it:  but, that we may be able to
ascertain the truth, we have sent to your parts John the notary of our
See, supported by our injunction, who may compel all parties to abide
the judgment of chosen arbitrators, and by his own execution carry their
judgments into effect.  Wherefore we exhort thy Fraternity by this
present writing to consider well with thyself beforehand the merits of
the cases; and, if you find that you have taken or hold anything
unjustly, in consideration of your priesthood to restore it before
trial.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxvii-p5"></span>Now, among numerous complaints, the
most distinguished Isidore has complained of having been excommunicated
and anathematised by thy Fraternity for invalid reasons.  And, when we
had wished to learn from one of thy clergy who was here for what cause
this had been done, he gave us to understand that it had been done for
no other cause than that the man had done thee an injury.  This
distresses us exceedingly; since, if it is so, thou shewest that thou
dost not think of heavenly things, but givest signs of having thy
conversation among things of earth, having brought to bear <span
id="page_117b">p. 117b</span> <span
id="iii.v.ii.xxvii-Page_117b"></span>the malediction of anathema to
avenge a private wrong; which is a thing forbidden by the sacred rules. 
Wherefore for the future be thoroughly circumspect and careful, and
presume not to inflict any such penalty again for vindication of thine
own wrongs.  For, shouldest thou do anything of the kind, know that it
will afterwards be avenged on thyself.
