<span id="iii.v.ii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xx-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXVI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.xx-p2"></span>To the Abbot Eusebius.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xx-p3"></span>Gregory to Eusebius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xx-p4"></span>Let thy Charity believe me that I have
been greatly saddened for thy sadness, as though I had myself suffered
wrong in thee.  But, when I afterwards learnt that, even after the most
reverend Maximianus, our brother and fellow-bishop, had restored thee to
his favour and communion, thy Love would not accept communion from him,
I then knew that what had been done before was just.  The humility of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.xx-p4.1"></span>God’s</span>
servants ought to appear in a time of affliction:  but those who lift
themselves up against their superiors shew that they scorn to be <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.xx-p4.2"></span>God’s</span> servants. 
And, indeed, what he once did ought not to have been done; but still it
ought to have been taken by thee with all humility:  and again, when he
restored to thee his favour, he ought to have been met with thanks.  And
because it was not so done by thee, I feel that to us in every way there
is cause for tears.  For it is no great thing for us to be humble to
those by whom we are honoured; for even any worldly man would do this: 
but we ought especially to be humble to those at whose hands we suffer. 
For the Psalmist says, *See my humility before mine enemies* ([Psal. ix.
14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.v.ii.xx-p4.3"></span>).  What life are we leading, if we will
not be humble even to our fathers?  Wherefore, most beloved son, I
beseech thee that all bitterness pass away from thy heart, lest
perchance the end should be near, and the ancient foe should, through
the iniquity of discord, bar against us the way to the eternal kingdom. 
Further, we have caused a hundred *solidi* to be given to thy Love
through Peter the subdeacon, which I beg thee to accept without offence.
