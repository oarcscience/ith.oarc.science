<span id="iii.v.vi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Epistle VI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.v-p2"></span>To King Childebert.

<span id="iii.v.vi.v-p3"></span>Gregory to Childebert, King of the
Franks <span id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md) .

<span id="iii.v.vi.v-p5"></span>As much as royal dignity is above that
of other men, so much in truth does the high position of your kingdom
excel that of the kingdoms of other nations.  And yet to be a king is
not extraordinary, there being others also; but to be a Catholic, which
others are not counted worthy to be, this is enough.  For as the
splendour of a great lamp shines by the clearness of its light in the
darkness of earth’s night, so the clear light of your faith glitters and
flashes amid the dark perfidy of other nations.  Whatever the other
kings glory in having you have.  But they are in this regard exceedingly
surpassed, because they have not the chief good thing which you have. 
In order, then, that they may be overcome in action as well as in faith,
let your Excellence always shew yourself kind to your subjects.  And, if
there are any things such as to offend your mind, punish them not
without enquiry.  For then you will the more please the King of kings,
that is the Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.v-p5.1"></span>Lord</span>, if, restraining your power, you
feel that you may not do all that you can.

<span id="iii.v.vi.v-p6"></span>Now that you keep purity of faith both
in mind and deed, the love that is in you of the blessed Peter, Prince
of the apostles, evidently shews, whose property has been so far well
governed and preserved under the sway of your supremacy.  But since
Dynamius the Patrician, who on our recommendation looked after this
property, is not able, as we have learnt, to govern it now, lest the
little patrimony which is in your parts should be ruined from neglect,
we have therefore sent the bearer of these presents, our most beloved
son the presbyter Candidus <span id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) to
govern it, whom we commend in all respects to your Excellency, greeting
you in the first place with paternal charity, with the request that, if
by any chance any wrong has been done there, or if the property of the
same little patrimony is detained by any one, the matter may be set
right, and what has been alienated may be restored to its original
ownership; that so your equity, as well as your faith, may shine forth
to all nations, which will be something very glorious and laudable.

<span id="iii.v.vi.v-p8"></span>Moreover we have sent to your Excellency
Saint Peter’s keys, containing a portion of his chains, to protect you
from all evils, when hung on your neck <span
id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md) .
