<span id="ii.v.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Sermon XXIII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p2.1"></span>On the Feast of the Nativity, III.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xii-p3"></span>I.  *The truths of the Incarnation never
suffer from being repeated.*

<span id="ii.v.xii-p4"></span>The things which are connected with the
mystery <span id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746.md) of to-day’s solemn feast
are well known to you, dearly-beloved, and have frequently been heard: 
but as yonder visible light affords pleasure to eyes that are
unimpaired, so to sound hearts does the Saviour’s nativity give eternal
joy; and we must not keep silent about it, though we cannot treat of it
as we ought.  For we believe that what Isaiah says, “who shall declare
his generation <span id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747.md) ?” applies not
only to that mystery, whereby the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p6.2"></span>God</span> is co-eternal with the Father, but
also to this birth whereby “the Word became flesh.”  And so <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p6.3"></span>God</span>, the Son of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p6.4"></span>God</span>, equal and of the
same nature from the Father and with the Father, Creator and <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p6.5"></span>Lord</span> of the Universe,
Who is completely present everywhere, and completely exceeds all things,
in the due course of time, which runs by His own disposal, chose for
Himself this day on which to be born of the blessed virgin Mary for the
salvation of the world, without loss of the mother’s honour.  For her
virginity was violated neither at the conception nor at the birth: 
“that it might be fulfilled,” as the Evangelist says, “which was spoken
by the <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p6.6"></span>Lord</span>
through Isaiah the prophet, saying, behold the virgin shall conceive in
the womb, and shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,
which is interpreted, <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p6.7"></span>God</span> with us <span
id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md) .”  For this wondrous child-bearing of
the holy Virgin produced in her offspring one person which was truly
human and truly Divine <span id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md) , because
neither substance so retained their properties that there could be any
division of persons in them; nor was the creature taken into partnership
with its Creator in such a way that the One was the in-dweller, and the
other the dwelling; but so that the one nature was blended <span
id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750.md) with the other.  And although the
nature which is taken is one, and that which takes is another, yet these
two diverse natures come together into such close union that it is one
and the same Son who says both that, as true Man, “He is less than the
Father,” and that, as true <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p9.1"></span>God</span>, “He is equal with the Father.”

<span id="ii.v.xii-p10"></span>II.  *The Arians could not comprehend the
union of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p10.1"></span>God</span>
and man.*

<span id="ii.v.xii-p11"></span>This union, dearly beloved, whereby the
Creator is joined to the creature, Arian blindness could not see with
the eyes of intelligence, but, not believing that the Only-begotten of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p11.1"></span>God</span> was of the
same glory and substance with the Father, spoke of the Son’s Godhead as
inferior, drawing its arguments from those <span id="page_133">p.
133</span> <span id="ii.v.xii-Page_133"></span>words which are to be
referred to the “form of a slave,” in respect of which, in order to show
that it belongs to no other or different person in Himself, the same Son
of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p11.2"></span>God</span> with the
same form, says, “The Father is greater than I <span
id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md) ,” just as He says with the same form,
“I and my Father are one <span id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752.md) .”  For
in “the form of a slave,” which He took at the end of the ages for our
restoration, He is inferior to the Father:  but in the form of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p13.2"></span>God</span>, in which He was
before the ages, He is equal to the Father.  In His human humiliation He
was “made of a woman, made under the Law <span
id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753.md) :”  in His Divine majesty He abides
the Word of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p14.2"></span>God</span>, “through whom all things were
made <span id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754.md) .”   <span
id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md) Accordingly, He Who in the form of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p16.2"></span>God</span> made man,
in the form of a slave was made man.  For both natures retain their own
proper character without loss:  and as the form of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p16.3"></span>God</span> did not do away
with the form of a slave, so the form of a slave did not impair the form
of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p16.4"></span>God <span
id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md) </span>.  And so the mystery of power
united to weakness, in respect of the same human nature, allows the Son
to be called inferior to the Father:  but the Godhead, which is One in
the Trinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, excludes all notion of
inequality.  For the eternity of the Trinity has nothing temporal,
nothing dissimilar in nature:  Its will is one, Its substance identical,
Its power equal, and yet there are not three <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p17.2"></span>Gods</span>, but one <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p17.3"></span>God <span id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md)
</span>; because it is a true and inseparable unity, where there can be
no diversity <span id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md) .  Thus in the
whole and perfect nature of true man was true <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p19.1"></span>God</span> born, complete in what was His
own, complete in what was ours.  And by “ours” we mean what the Creator
formed in us from the beginning, and what He undertook to repair.  For
what the deceiver brought in, and man deceived committed, had no trace
in the Saviour; nor because He partook of man’s weaknesses, did He
therefore share our faults.  He took the form of a slave without stain
of sin, increasing the human and not diminishing the divine:  for that
“emptying of Himself,” whereby the Invisible made Himself visible, was
the bending down of pity, not the failing of power.

<span id="ii.v.xii-p20"></span>III.  *The Incarnation was necessary to
the taking away of sin.*

<span id="ii.v.xii-p21"></span>In order therefore that we might be
called to eternal bliss from our original bond and from earthly errors,
He came down Himself to us to Whom we could not ascend, because,
although there was in many the love of truth, yet the variety of our
shifting opinions was deceived by the craft of misleading demons, and
man’s ignorance was dragged into diverse and conflicting notions by a
falsely-called science.  But to remove this mockery, whereby men’s minds
were taken captive to serve the arrogant devil, the teaching of the Law
was not sufficient, nor could our nature be restored merely by the
Prophets’ exhortations; but the reality of redemption had to be added to
moral injunctions, and our fundamentally corrupt origin had to be
re-born afresh.  A Victim had to be offered for our atonement Who should
be both a partner of our race and free from our contamination, so that
this design of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p21.1"></span>God</span> whereby it pleased Him to take
away the sin of the world in the Nativity and Passion of Jesus Christ,
might reach to all generations <span id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md)
:  and that we should not be disturbed but rather strengthened by these
mysteries, which vary with the character of the times, since the Faith,
whereby we live, has at no time suffered variation.

<span id="ii.v.xii-p23"></span>IV.  *The blessings of the Incarnation
stretch backwards as well as reach forward*.

<span id="ii.v.xii-p24"></span>Accordingly let those men cease their
complaints who with disloyal murmurs speak against the dispensations of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p24.1"></span>God</span>, and babble
about the lateness of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p24.2"></span>Lord’s</span> Nativity as if that, which was
fulfilled in the last age of the world, had no bearing upon the times
that are past.  For the Incarnation of the Word did but contribute to
the doing of that which was done <span id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md)
:  and the mystery of man’s salvation was never in the remotest age at a
standstill.  What the apostles foretold, that the prophets announced: 
nor was that fulfilled too late which has always been believed.  But the
Wisdom and Goodness of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p25.2"></span>God</span> made us more receptive of His call
by thus delaying the work which brought salvation:  so that what through
so many ages had been foretold by many signs, many utterances, and many
mysteries, might not be doubtful in these days of the Gospel:  and that
the Saviour’s nativity, which was to exceed all wonders and all the
measure of human knowledge, might engender in us a Faith so much the
firmer, as the foretelling of it had been <span id="page_134">p.
134</span> <span id="ii.v.xii-Page_134"></span>ancient and
oft-repeated.  And so it was no new counsel, no tardy pity whereby <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p25.3"></span>God</span> took thought for
men:  but from the constitution of the world He ordained one and the
same Cause of Salvation for all.  For the grace of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p25.4"></span>God</span>, by which the
whole body of the saints is ever justified, was augmented, not begun,
when Christ was born:  and this mystery of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p25.5"></span>God’s</span> great love, wherewith the whole
world is now filled, was so effectively presignified that those who
believed that promise obtained no less than they, who were the actual
recipients.

<span id="ii.v.xii-p26"></span>V.  *The coming of Christ in our flesh
corresponds with our becoming members of His body.*

<span id="ii.v.xii-p27"></span>Wherefore since the loving-kindness is
manifest, dearly beloved, wherewith all the riches of Divine goodness
are showered on us, whose call to eternal life has been assisted not
only by the profitable examples of those who went before, but also by
the visible and bodily appearing of the Truth Itself, we are bound to
keep the day of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p27.1"></span>Lord’s</span> Nativity with no slothful nor
carnal joy.  And we shall each keep it worthily and thoroughly, if we
remember of what Body we are members, and to what a Head we are joined,
lest any one as an ill-fitting joint cohere not with the rest of the
sacred building.  Consider, dearly beloved and by the illumination of
the Holy Spirit thoughtfully bear in mind Who it was that received us
into Himself, and that we have received in us:  since, as the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p27.2"></span>Lord</span> Jesus became our
flesh by being born, so we also became His body by being re-born. 
Therefore are we both members of Christ, and the temple of the Holy
Ghost:  and for this reason the blessed Apostle says, “Glorify and carry
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p27.3"></span>God</span> in your
body <span id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md) :”  for while suggesting to
us the standard of His own gentleness and humility, He fills us with
that power whereby He redeemed us, as the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p28.3"></span>Lord</span> Himself promises:  “come unto Me
all ye who labour and are heavy-laden, and I will refresh you.  Take My
yoke upon you and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly of heart, and ye
shall find rest to your souls. <span id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md)
”  Let us then take the yoke, that is not heavy nor irksome, of the
Truth that rules us, and let us imitate His humility, to Whose glory we
wish to be conformed:  He Himself helping us and leading us to His
promises, Who, according to His great mercy, is powerful to blot out our
sins, and to perfect His gifts in us, Jesus Christ our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xii-p29.2"></span>Lord</span>, Who lives and
reigns for ever and ever.  Amen.

<span id="ii.v.xii-p5"></span> *Sacramentum* (as usual).  I would
venture to urge that Bright is hardly justified in interpreting this as
“sacred observance” here, unless I have misunderstood his note 8. 
Surely Leo means, the facts and details and consequences arising from
the mystery of the Incarnation are well known to you.  This agrees
better with the context and is in accordance with his common use of the
word.

<span id="ii.v.xii-p18"></span> Several times in this chapter and
elsewhere in Leo the language reminds us forcibly of the Quicunque
“which,” says Bright (note 14), “whatever be its date, was clearly
compiled by some one accustomed to the theological terminology of the
Latin church of the fifth century.”

<span id="ii.v.xii-p22"></span> From what he goes on to say in the next
chapter, is clear that Leo meant that both *past* and *future*
generations of mankind shared in the benefits of the Incarnation:  cf.
Bright’s note 16.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[133:761](2120190.htm#fr_760.md) <span

<span id="ii.v.xii-p25"></span> *Hoc contulit faciendum quod factum*,
i.e. the Incarnation was but a part (though an essential part) in the
Divine scheme of redemption, and, as he goes on to show, could not have
occurred sooner than it did occur:  for it would have marred the
sequence of the whole design:  cf. Bright’s note 17:  also S. [John
viii. 56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md)<span
id="ii.v.xii-p25.1"></span>.

*Glorificate et portate deum in corpore vestro*, quoted again in this
form in Sermon LIII. 3.  Observe (1) that , “*et portate*” is doubtless
a very old ‘Western’ gloss” Bright, note 18), and (2) that the words
“and in your spirit which are <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xii-p28.2"></span>God’s</span>” (A.V.) find no place in the
Latin Versions, and are now omitted in R.V.
