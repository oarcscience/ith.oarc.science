<span id="iii.v.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xiv-p2"></span>*To Maximus, Pretender
(Præsumptorem)* <span id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md) .

<span id="iii.v.iv.xiv-p4"></span>Gregory to Maximus, Pretender in
Salona.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xiv-p5"></span>Though the merits of any one’s life
were in other respects such as to offer no impediment to his ordination
to priestly offices, yet the crime of canvassing in itself is condemned
by the severest strictness of the canons.  Now we have been informed
that thou, having either obtained surreptitiously, or pretended, an
order from the most pious princes, hast forced thy way to the order of
priesthood <span id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539.md) , which is of all
men to be venerated, while being in thy life unworthy.  And this without
any hesitation we believed, inasmuch as thy life and age are not unknown
to us, and further, because we are not ignorant of the mind of our most
serene lord the Emperor, in that he is not accustomed to mix himself up
<span id="page_151b">p. 151b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iv.xiv-Page_151b"></span>in the causes of priests, lest he
should in any way be burdened by our sins.  An unheard-of wickedness is
also spoken of; that, even after our interdiction, which was pronounced
under pain of excommunication of thee and those who should ordain thee,
it is said that thou wast brought forward by a military force, and that
presbyters, deacons, and other clergy were beaten.  Which proceeding we
can in no wise call a consecration, since it was celebrated by
excommunicated men.  Since, therefore, without any precedent, thou hast
violated such and so great a dignity, namely that of the priesthood, we
enjoin that, until I shall have ascertained from the letters of our
lords or of our *responsalis*, that thou wast ordained under a true and
not a surreptitious order, thou and thy ordainers by no means presume to
handle anything connected with the priestly office, and that you
approach not the service of the holy altar till you have heard from us
again.  But, if you should presume to act in contravention of this
order, be ye anathema from <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xiv-p6.1"></span>God</span> and from the blessed Peter,
Prince of the apostles, that your punishment may afford an example to
other catholic churches also, through their contemplation of the
judgment upon you.  The month of May, Indiction 12.
