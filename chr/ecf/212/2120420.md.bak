<span id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXVII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-p2"></span>To Domitian, Metropolitan <span
id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md) .

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-p4"></span>Gregory to Domitian, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-p5"></span>On receiving the letters of your
most sweet Blessedness I greatly rejoiced, since they spoke much to me
of sacred Scripture.  And, finding in them the dainties that I love, I
greedily devoured them.  Therein also were many things intermingled
about external and necessary affairs.  And you have acted as though
preparing a banquet for the mind so that the offered dainties might
please the more from their diversity.  And if indeed external affairs,
like inferior and ordinary kinds of food, are less savoury, yet they
have been treated by you so skilfully as to be taken gladly, since even
contemptible kinds of food are usually made sweet by the sauce of one
who cooks well.  Now, while the truth of the History is kept to, what I
had said some time ago about its divine meaning ought not to be
rejected.  For, although, since you will have it so, its meaning may not
suit my case, yet, from its very context, what was said as being drawn
from it may be held without hesitation.  For her violator (*i.e.
Dinah’s*) is called the prince of the country ([Genes. xxxiv.
2](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-p5.1"></span>), by whom the devil is plainly
denoted, seeing that our Redeemer says, *Now shall the prince of this
world be cast out* ([John xii. 31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md)<span
id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-p5.2"></span>).  And he also seeks her for his wife,
because the evil spirit hastens to possess lawfully the soul which he
has first corrupted by hidden seduction.  Wherefore the sons of Jacob,
being very wroth, take their swords against the whole house of Sichem
and his country ([Genes. xxxiv.
25](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#025.md)<span
id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-p5.3"></span>), because by all who have zeal those
also are to be attacked who become abettors of the evil spirit.  And
they first enjoin on them circumcision, and afterwards, while they are
sore, slay them.  For severe teachers, if they know not how to moderate
their zeal, though cutting off the bias of corruption by preaching,
nevertheless, when delinquents already mourn for the evil they had done,
are frequently still savage in roughness of discipline, and harder than
they should be.  For those who had already cut off their foreskins ought
not to have died, since such as lament the sin of lechery, and turn the
pleasure of the flesh into sorrow, ought not to experience from their
teachers roughness of discipline, lest the Redeemer of the human race be
Himself loved less, if in His behalf the soul is afflicted more than it
should be.  Hence also to these his sons Jacob says, *Ye have troubled
me, and made me odious to the Canaanites* ([Gen.
34.30](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-p5.4"></span>).  For, when teachers still cruelly
attack what the delinquents already mourn for, the weak mind’s very love
for its Redeemer grows cold, because it feels itself to be afflicted in
that wherein of itself it does not spare itself.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-p6"></span>So much therefore I would say in
order to shew that the sense which I set forth is not improbable in
connexion with the context.  But what has been inferred from the same
passage by your Holiness for my comfort I gladly accept, since in the
understanding of sacred Scripture whatever is not opposed to a sound
faith ought not to be rejected.  For, even as from the same gold some
make necklaces, some rings, and some bracelets, for ornament, so from
the same knowledge of sacred Scripture different expositors, through
innumerable ways of understanding it, compose as it were various
ornaments, which <span id="page_143b">p. 143b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-Page_143b"></span>nevertheless all serve for the
adornment of the heavenly bride.  Further, I rejoice exceedingly that
your most sweet Blessedness, even though occupied with secular affairs,
still brings back its genius vigilantly to the understanding of Holy
Writ.  For so indeed it is needful that, if the former cannot be
altogether avoided, the latter should not be altogether put aside.  But
I beseech you by Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-p6.1"></span>God</span>, stretch out the hand of
prayer to me who am labouring in so great billows of tribulation, that
by your intercession I may be lifted up to the heights, who am pressed
down to the depths by the weight of my sins.  Moreover, though I grieve
that the Emperor of the Persians has not been converted, yet I
altogether rejoice for that you have preached to him the Christian
faith; since, though he has not been counted worthy to come to the
light, yet your Holiness will have the reward of your preaching.  For
the Ethiopian, too, goes black into the bath, and comes out black; but
still the keeper of the bath receives his pay.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-p7"></span>Further, of Mauricius you say well,
that from the shadow I may know the statue; that is, that in small
things I may perpend greater things.  In this matter, however, we trust
him, since oaths and hostages bind his soul to us.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxxiv-p3"></span> This Domitian, Bishop of Melitene
and Metropolitan of Roman Armenia, was a kinsman of the Emperor Maurice,
and had lately been successfully employed by him in coming to terms with
the Persian king, Chosroes II., as is related in the histories of
Evagrius and Theophylact.  The latter describes him as “holy in life,
sweet in speech, ready in action, most prudent in council” (*Hist*. iv.
14).  He also gives at length an eloquent sermon of his, delivered after
the cession, through his mediation, of the city Martyropolis in
Mesopotamia to the Roman Emperor (IV. 16).  Chosroes II., who is said to
have had a strong regard for Domitian, appears to have had some leanings
towards Christianity.  We are told that, when flying from his enemies in
Persia, and in doubt whether to seek refuge with the Romans or the
Turks, he had let his horse take its own course, calling on the God of
the Christians for guidance, and thus found his way to Circesium, where
he was received by Probus the Governor (*Theophyl*. IV. 10; *Evagr*. *H.
E*. VI. 16).  Further, it is related that, on one occasion, when Probus,
bishop of Chalcedon, had been sent to him as ambassador by the Emperor,
he requested to be shewn a portrait of the Blessed Virgin, which he
adored when he saw it, saying that he had seen the original in a vision
(*Theophyl*. V. 15); and also that he attributed his own success in
arms, and the pregnancy of his favourite wife Syra (Shirin), who was
herself a Christian, to the intercession of S. Sergius, whom he had
invoked, and that he sent a cross of pure gold, adorned with jewels,
which he had vowed with other presents, to the shrine of the saint,
together with a letter of acknowledgment addressed to him (*Theophyl*.
V. 13, 14; *Evagr. H. E*. VI. 20).  But he certainly never became a
Christian, though it appears from the letter before us that Domitian had
done his best to convert him.  The earlier part of this epistle refers
evidently to some allegorical interpretation of Scripture by Gregory
after his usual manner, to which Domitian had taken objection.
