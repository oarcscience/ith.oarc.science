<p class="c18"><a name="iii.iv.iv.iv-p3"></A><i>Admonition</i>4.&#160; Differently to be admonished are the joyful and the sad.&#160; That is, before the joyful are to be set the sad things that follow upon punishment; but before the sad the promised glad things of the kingdom.&#160; Let the joyful learn by the asperity of threatenings what to be afraid of:&#160; let the sad bear what joys of reward they may look forward to.&#160; For to the former it is said, <i>Woe unto you that laugh now!&#160; For ye shall weep</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025">Luke vi. 25</a><a name="iii.iv.iv.iv-p3.1"></A>); but the latter hear from the teaching of the same Master, <i>I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man shall take from you</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022">Joh. xvi. 22</a><a name="iii.iv.iv.iv-p3.2"></A>).&#160; But some are not made joyful or sad by circumstances, but are so by temperament.&#160; And to such it should be intimated that certain defects are connected with certain temperaments; that the joyful have lechery close at hand, and the sad wrath.&#160; Hence it is necessary for every one to consider not only what he suffers from his peculiar temperament, but also what worse thing presses on him in connection with it; lest, while he fights not at all against that which he has, he succumb also to that from which he supposes himself free.</p>
