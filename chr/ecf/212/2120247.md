<span id="iii.iv.iii.i-p4"></span>How one who has in due order arrived
at a place of rule ought to demean himself in it.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.i-p5"></span>The conduct of a prelate ought so far
to transcend the conduct of the people as the life of a shepherd is wont
to exalt him above the flock.  For one whose estimation is such that the
people are called his flock is bound anxiously to consider what great
necessity is laid upon him to maintain rectitude.  It is necessary,
then, that in thought he should be pure, in action chief; discreet in
keeping silence, profitable in speech; a near neighbour to every one in
sympathy, exalted above all in contemplation; a familiar friend of good
livers through humility, unbending against the vices of evil-doers
through zeal for righteousness; not relaxing in his care for what is
inward from being occupied in outward things, nor neglecting to provide
for outward things in his solicitude for what is inward.  But the things
which we have thus briefly touched on let us now unfold and discuss more
at length.
