<span id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p2"></span>Of those who covet pre-eminence, and
seize on the language of the Apostle to serve the purpose of their own
cupidity.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p3"></span>But for the most part those who covet
pre-eminence seize on the language of the Apostle to serve the purpose
of their own cupidity, where he says, *If a man desire the office of a
bishop, he desireth a good work* ([1 Tim. iii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p3.1"></span>).  <span id="page_6b">p. 6b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.ix-Page_6b"></span>But, while praising the desire, he
forthwith turns what he has praised to fear when at once he adds, *but a
bishop must be blameless* ([1 Tim. iii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p3.2"></span>).  And, when he subsequently enumerates
the necessary virtues, he makes manifest what this blamelessness
consists in.  And so, with regard to their desire, he approves them, but
by his precept he alarms them; as if saying plainly, I praise what ye
seek; but first learn what it is ye seek; lest, while ye neglect to
measure yourselves, your blamefulness appear all the fouler for its
haste to be seen by all in the highest place of honour.  For the great
master in the art of ruling impels by approval and checks by alarms; so
that, by describing the height of blamelessness, he may restrain his
hearers from pride, and, by praising the office which is sought, dispose
them to the life required.  Nevertheless it is to be noted that this was
said at a time when whosoever was set over people was usually the first
to be led to the torments of martyrdom.  At that time, therefore, it was
laudable to seek the office of a bishop, since through it there was no
doubt that a man would come in the end to heavier pains.  Hence even the
office of a bishop itself is defined as a good work, when it is said,
*If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work* ([1
Tim. iii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p3.3"></span>).  Wherefore he that seeks, not this
ministry of a good work, but the glory of distinction, is himself a
witness against himself that he does not desire the office of a bishop;
inasmuch as that man not only does not love at all the sacred office,
but even knows not what it is, who, panting after supreme rule, is fed
by the subjection of others in the hidden meditation of his thought,
rejoices in his own praises, lifts up his heart to honour, exults in
abundant affluence.  Thus worldly gain is sought under colour of that
honour by which worldly gains should have been destroyed; and, when the
mind thinks to seize on the highest post of humility for its own
elation, it inwardly changes what it outwardly desires.

part flatters itself with a feigned promise of good works.](2120243.md)
