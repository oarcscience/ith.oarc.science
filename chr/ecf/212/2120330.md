<span id="iii.v.i.xxviii-p2"></span>To Peter, Subdeacon.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxviii-p3"></span>Gregory to Peter, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxviii-p4"></span>The venerable Paulinus bishop of the
city of Taurum (*Taurianum in Brutia*), has told us that his monks have
been scattered by reason of barbaric invasions, and that they are now
wandering through the whole of Sicily, and that, being without a ruler,
they neither have a care of their souls, nor pay attention to the
discipline of their profession.  On this account we enjoin thee to
search out with all care and diligence, and collect together, these same
monks, and to place them with the said bishop, their ruler, in the
monastery of Saint Theodorus situate in the city of Messana, that both
such as are there now, whom we find to be in need of a ruler, and those
of his congregation whom you may have found and brought back, may be
able, under his leadership, to serve the Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxviii-p4.1"></span>Lord</span> together.  Know also that we
have signified this matter to the venerable Felix, bishop of the same
city, lest anything ordained in the diocese committed to him should be
disturbed without his knowledge.
