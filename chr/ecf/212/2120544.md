<span id="iii.v.vii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vii.xii-p2"></span>*To the Clergy and People
Ariminum* <span id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697.md) .

<span id="iii.v.vii.xii-p4"></span>Gregory to the Clergy, &c.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xii-p5"></span>Our pastoral charge constrains us to
succour with anxious consideration any Churches that are deprived of the
government of a priest.  Accordingly, inasmuch as your Church has long
been deprived of pastoral rule from the malady, as you know, of its own
priest, we, moved by your entreaties, have not failed to admonish the
said bishop, that, if he should feel himself recovered from that malady,
he should resume the ministry of the priesthood undertaken by him.  And
he, having been again and again warned by us, has now under the pressure
of the same malady intimated by a supplication addressed to us in
writing that by reason of this malady he can by no means rise to the
government of the said Church or to the office undertaken by him.  We
therefore, compelled by the hopeless condition of this same person, have
held it necessary to take thought for the setting in order of your
Church.  We exhort, then, that all of you, with one consent, without
noise or disturbance, choose with the help of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xii-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> such a priest to preside over
you as may not be disapproved by the venerable canons, and also be found
worthy of so great a ministry.  And let him, when required, come to us
to be ordained, with the solemnity of a decree attested by the
subscriptions of all and followed up by the written approval of the
visitor <span id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698.md) , to the end that
your Church, by the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xii-p6.1"></span>Lord’s</span> ordering, may have its own
priest.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xii-p7"></span>We desire also that him whom your
unanimity may have chosen you take without delay to our brother and
fellow-bishop Marinianus at Ravenna <span
id="fr_1699"></span>[1700](#fn_1699.md) , that, having been thoroughly
examined and tested by him, he may be supported by his testimony also
when he comes to us.

been commissioned, as was usual in such cases, to visit the church of
Ariminum during the incapacity of its proper bishop.  The Epistle which
follows this (Ep. XXI., which, as not throwing further light on the
proceedings, has not been translated) is addressed to him, directing him
to see to the due election, &c., of a successor to Castorius.
