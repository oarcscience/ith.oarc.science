<span id="iii.v.v.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.xviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXIX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xviii-p2"></span>*To Anastasius, Bishop* <span
id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md) .

<span id="iii.v.v.xviii-p4"></span>Gregory to Anastasius, Bishop of
Antioch.

<span id="iii.v.v.xviii-p5"></span>*Glory to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xviii-p5.1"></span>God</span> in the highest and on earth
peace to men of good will* ([Luke ii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xviii-p5.2"></span>), because that great river which once
had left the rocks of Antioch dry has returned at length to its proper
channel, and waters the subject valleys that are near, so as also to
bring forth fruit, some thirty-fold, some sixty-fold, and some an
hundred-fold.  For now there is no doubt that many flowers of souls are
growing up in its valleys, and that they will come even to ripe fruit
through the streams of your tongue.  Wherefore with voice of heart and
mouth from our inmost soul we render due <span id="page_175b">p.
175b</span> <span id="iii.v.v.xviii-Page_175b"></span>praise to Almighty
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xviii-p5.3"></span>God</span>, and
rejoice in your Blessedness, not with you only, but with all who are
subject to you.  I have received the letters of your Holiness, to me
most sweet and pleasant, while we ourselves, if I may so speak, are
sweating under the same toil with you.  And indeed I know how heavy must
be to thee the burden of external cares after those heights of rest,
wherein with the hand of the heart thou wert touching heavenly secrets. 
But remember that thou rulest an Apostolic See, and assuagest sorrow the
more readily from being made all things to all men.  In the Books of
Kings, as your accomplished Holiness knows, a certain man is described
who used either hand for the right hand ([1 Chron. xii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xviii-p5.4"></span>).  And, with regard to this, I am not
doubtful about the lord Anastasius, of old my most sweet and most holy
patron, that, while he draws earthly works to heavenly profit, he turns
the left hand to the right hand’s use; so that his heavenly intentness
may accomplish its work, so to speak, with the right hand, and also,
when he is led in his care of temporal things towards the interests of
justice, the left hand may acquire the strength of the right.

<span id="iii.v.v.xviii-p6"></span>And indeed these things cannot be
without heavy labour and trouble.  But let us remember the labours of
those who went before us; and what we endure will not be hard.  For *We
must through many tribulations enter into the kingdom of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xviii-p6.1"></span>God</span>* ([Acts xiv.
22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xviii-p6.2"></span>).  And, *We were pressed out of measure,
yea and above strength, insomuch that we were weary even of life.  But
we ourselves, too, had the answer of death in ourselves, that we should
not trust in ourselves* ([2 Cor. 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xviii-p6.3"></span>).  And yet *The sufferings of this
present time are not worthy to be compared with the supervening glory
which shall be revealed in us* ([Rom. viii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xviii-p6.4"></span>).  How then can we that are weak sheep
pass without labour through the heat of this world wherein we know that
even rams have suffered under heavy toil?

<span id="iii.v.v.xviii-p7"></span>Further, what tribulations I suffer
in this land from the swords of the Lombards, from the iniquities of
judges, from the press of business, from the care of subjects, and also
from bodily affliction, I am unable to express either by pen or tongue. 
Concerning which things even though I might say something briefly, I
hesitate, lest to your most holy Charity, while afflicted by your own
tribulations, I should add mine also.  But may Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xviii-p7.1"></span>God</span> both in the
abundance of His loving-kindness fill the mind of your most holy
Blessedness with all comfort, and grant at some time, on account of your
intercession, to unworthy me to rest from these evils which I suffer. 
Amen.  Grace.  These words, as you see, taken from what you had written,
I insert in my epistles, that your Blessedness may perceive with regard
to Saint Ignatius that he is not only yours, but also ours <span
id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md) .  For, as we have his master, the
Prince of the apostles in common, so also no one of us ought to have to
himself alone the disciple of this same Prince <span
id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md) .  Moreover, we have received your
blessing <span id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604.md) , which is of sweet
smell and of a good savour, with the feelings that were due to it.  And
we give thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xviii-p10.1"></span>God</span> that what you do, what you
say, and what you give, is fragrant and savoury.  For your life
therefore let us say together, let us say all, *Glory to <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xviii-p10.2"></span>God</span> in the
highest, and on earth peace to men of good will.*
