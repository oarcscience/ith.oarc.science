<span id="ii.iv.clxv"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.clxv-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.clxv-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXXI.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.clxv-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.clxv-p2.1"></span>To Timothy, Bishop of Alexandria.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.clxv-p3"></span>Leo, the bishop, to Timothy, catholic
bishop of the church of Alexandria.

<span id="ii.iv.clxv-p4"></span>I.  *He congratulates him on his
election, and bids him win back wanderers to the fold*.

<span id="ii.iv.clxv-p5"></span>It is clearly apparent from the
brightness of the sentiment quoted by the Apostle, that “all things work
together for good to them that love <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.clxv-p5.1"></span>God <span id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md)
</span>,” and by the dispensation of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.clxv-p6.2"></span>God’s</span> pity, where adversities are
received, there also prosperity is given.  This the experience of the
Alexandrine church shows, in which the moderation and long suffering of
the humble has laid up for themselves great store in return for their
patience:  because “the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.clxv-p6.3"></span>Lord</span> is nigh them that are of a
contrite heart, and shall save those that are humble in spirit <span
id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) ,” our noble Prince’s faith being
glorified in all things, through whom “the right-hand of the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.clxv-p7.2"></span>Lord</span> hath done great
acts <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md) ,” in preventing the
abomination of antichrist any longer occupying the throne of the blessed
Fathers; whose blasphemy has hurt no one more than himself, because
although he has induced some to be partners of his guilt, yet he has
inexpiably stained himself with blood.  And hence concerning that which
under the direction of Faith your election, brother, by the clergy, and
the laity, and all the faithful, has brought about, I assure you that
the whole of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.clxv-p8.2"></span>Lord’s</span> Church rejoices with me, and
it is my strong desire that the Divine pity will in its loving-kindness
confirm this joy with manifold signs of grace, your own devotion
ministering thereto in all things, so that you may sedulously win over,
through the Church’s prayers, those also who have hitherto resisted the
Truth, to reconciliation with <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.clxv-p8.3"></span>God</span>, and, as a zealous ruler, bring
them into union with the mystic body of the catholic Faith, whose
entirety admits of no division, imitating that true and gentle Shepherd,
who laid down His <span id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span
id="ii.iv.clxv-Page_114"></span>life for His sheep, and, when one sheep
wandered, drove it not back with the lash, but carried it back to the
fold on His own shoulders.

<span id="ii.iv.clxv-p9"></span>II.  *Let him be watchful against heresy
and send frequent reports to Rome.*

<span id="ii.iv.clxv-p10"></span>Take heed, then, dearly beloved
brother, lest any trace of either Nestorius’ or Eutyches’ error be found
in <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.clxv-p10.1"></span>God’s</span>
people:  because “no one can lay any foundation except that which is
laid, which is Christ Jesus <span id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md) ;”
who would not have reconciled the whole world to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.clxv-p11.2"></span>God</span> the Father, had He not by the
regeneration of Faith adopted us all in the reality of our flesh <span
id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) .  Whenever, therefore, opportunities
arise which you can use for writing, brother, even as you necessarily
and in accordance with custom have done in sending a report of your
ordination to us by our sons, Daniel the presbyter and Timothy the
deacon, so continue to act at all times and send us, who will be anxious
for them, as frequent accounts as possible of the progress of peace, in
order that by regular intercourse we may feel that “the love of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.clxv-p12.1"></span>God</span> is shed abroad
in our hearts through the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us <span
id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) .”  Dated the 18th of August, in the
consulship of Magnus and Apollonius (460).

and I have therefore translated the expression as literally as possible.
