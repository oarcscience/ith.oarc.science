<span id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXVII <span
id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) .</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p3.1"></span>To Theodosius Augustus.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p4"></span>Leo to Theodosius Augustus.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p5"></span>Unity of Faith is essential but the
point at issue hardly required a general council, it is so clear.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p6"></span>On receiving your clemency’s letter, I
perceived that the universal Church has much cause for joy, that you
will have the Christian Faith, whereby the Divine Trinity is honoured
and worshipped, to be different or out of harmony with itself in
nothing.  For what more effectual support can be given to human affairs
in calling upon <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p6.1"></span>God’s</span> mercy than when one
thanksgiving, and the sacrifice of one confession is offered to His
majesty by all.  Wherein the devotions of the priests and all the
faithful will reach at last their completeness, if in what was done for
our redemption by <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p6.2"></span>God</span> the Word, the only Son of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p6.3"></span>God,</span> nothing else
be believed than what He Himself ordered to be preached and believed. 
Wherefore although every consideration prevents my attendance on the day
which your piety has fixed for the councils of bishops <span
id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md) :  for there are no precedents for
such a thing, and the needs of the times do not allow me to leave the
city, especially as the point of Faith at issue is so clear, that it
would have been more reasonable to abstain from proclaiming a synod: 
yet as far as the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p7.1"></span>Lord</span> vouchsafes to help me, I have
bestowed my zeal upon obeying your clemency’s commands, by appointing my
brethren who are competent to act as the case requires in removing
offences, and who can represent me:  because no question has arisen on
which there can or ought to be any doubt.  Dated 21st of June, in the
consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes, (449).

<span id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p2"></span> This letter is on the same subject as
Lett. XXIX. above, but as the wording of it contains some interesting
matter, it is here given in full.  There is no Gk. version extant, and
how there came to be two letters within a week of one another on the
same topic is not clear.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[50:356](2120047.htm#fr_355.md) <span
id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p6.4"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxxvii-p7"></span> Cf. Lett. XXIX. above, and especially
XXXI., chap. iv., where the reasons are given rather more fully.
