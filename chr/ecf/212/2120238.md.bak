<span id="iii.iv.ii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii.v-p2"></span>That for the most part the occupation
of government dissipates the solidity of the mind.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.v-p3"></span>Often the care of government, when
undertaken, distracts the heart in divers directions; and one is found
unequal to dealing with particular things, while with confused mind
divided among many.  Whence a certain wise man providently dissuades,
saying, *My son, meddle not with many matters* ([Ecclesiasticus
11.10](../../../bib/apo/sir011.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.v-p3.1"></span>); because, that is, the mind is by no
means collected on the plan of any single work while parted among
divers.  And, when it is drawn abroad by unwonted care, it is emptied of
the solidity of inward fear:  it becomes anxious in the ordering of
things that are without, and, ignorant of itself alone, knows how to
think of many things, while itself it knows not.  For, when it
implicates itself more than is needful in things that are without, it is
as though it were so occupied during a journey as to forget where it was
going; so that, being estranged from the business of self-examination,
it does not even consider the losses it is suffering, or know how great
they are.  For neither did <span id="page_4b">p. 4b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.v-Page_4b"></span>Hezekiah believe himself to be sinning
([2 Kings xx. 13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.v-p3.2"></span>), when he shewed to the strangers who came
to him his storehouses of spices; but he fell under the anger of the
judge, to the condemnation of his future offspring, from what he
supposed himself to be doing lawfully ([Isa.
1:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000.md), [Isa.
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.v-p3.3"></span>).  Often, when means are abundant, and
many things can be done for subordinates to admire, the mind exalts
itself in thought, and fully provokes to itself the anger of the judge,
though not breaking out in overt acts of iniquity.  For he who judges is
within; that which is judged is within.  When, then, in heart we
transgress, what we are doing within ourselves is hidden from men. but
yet in the eyes of the judge we sin.  For neither did the King of
Babylon then first stand guilty of elation ([Dan. iv.
16](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#016.md)<span id="iii.iv.ii.v-p3.4"></span>,
*seq*.) when he came to utter words of elation, inasmuch as even before,
when he had given no utterance to his elation, he heard the sentence of
reprobation from the prophet’s mouth.  For he had already wiped off the
fault of the pride he had been guilty of, when he proclaimed to all the
nations under him the omnipotent <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.v-p3.5"></span>God</span> whom he found himself to have
offended.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.v-p4"></span>But after this, elevated by the success
of his dominion, and rejoicing in having done great things, he first
preferred himself to all in thought, and afterwards, still
vain-glorious, said, *Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for
the house of the kingdom, and in the might of my power, and for the
honour of my majesty?* ([Dan. iv.
30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.v-p4.1"></span>.)  Which utterance of his, as we see, fell
openly under the vengeance of the wrath which his hidden elation
kindled.  For the strict judge first sees invisibly what he afterwards
reproves by publicly smiting it.  Hence him He turned even into an
irrational animal, separated him from human society, changed his mind
and joined him to the beasts of the field, that in obviously strict and
just judgment he who had esteemed himself great beyond men should lose
even his being as a man.  Now in adducing these things we are not
finding fault with dominion, but guarding the infirmity of the heart
from coveting it, lest any that are imperfect should venture to snatch
at supreme rule, or those who stumble on plain ground set foot on a
precipice.
