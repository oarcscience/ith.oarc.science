<span id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXIII.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>To the Synod of Ephesus <span
id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330.md) .</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p4"></span>Leo, bishop, to the holy Synod which
is assembled at Ephesus.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p5"></span>I.  *He commends the Emperor’s appeal
to the chair of Peter*.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p6"></span>The devout faith of our most clement
prince, <span id="page_47">p. 47</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xxxiii-Page_47"></span>knowing that it especially concerns his
glory to prevent any seed of error from springing up within the catholic
Church, has paid such deference to the Divine institutions as to apply
to the authority of the Apostolic See for a proper settlement:  as if he
wished it to be declared by the most blessed Peter himself what was
praised in his confession, when the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p6.1"></span>Lord</span> said, “whom do men say that I,
the Son of man, am <span id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md) ?” and the
disciples mentioned various people’s opinion:  but, when He asked what
they themselves believed, the chief of the apostles, embracing the
fulness of the Faith in one short sentence, said, “Thou art the Christ,
the son of the living <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p7.2"></span>God <span
id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332.md) </span>:”  that is, Thou who truly art
Son of man art also truly Son of the living <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p8.2"></span>God</span>:  Thou, I say, true in Godhead,
true in flesh and one altogether <span id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md)
, the properties of the two natures being kept intact.  And if Eutyches
had believed this intelligently and thoroughly, he would never have
retreated from the path of this Faith.  For Peter received this answer
from the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p9.4"></span>Lord</span> for his confession.  “Blessed
art thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto
thee, but My Father which is in heaven.  And I say unto thee, that thou
art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church:  and the gates of
Hades shall not prevail against it <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) .”  But he who both rejects the
blessed Peter’s confession, and gainsays Christ’s Gospel, is far removed
from union with this building; for he shows himself never to have had
any zeal for understanding the Truth, and to have only the empty
appearance of high esteem, who did not adorn the hoary hairs of old age
with any ripe judgment of the heart.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p11"></span>II.  *The heresy of Eutyches is to be
condemned, though his full repentance may lead to his restitution.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p12"></span>But because the healing even of such
men must not be neglected, and the most Christian Emperor has piously
and devoutly desired a council of bishops to be held, that all error may
be destroyed by a fuller judgment, I have sent our brothers Julius the
bishop, Renatus the presbyter, and my son Hilary the deacon, and with
them Dulcitius the notary, whose faith we have proved, to be present in
my stead at your holy assembly, brethren, and settle in common with you
what is in accordance with the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p12.1"></span>Lord’s</span> will.  To wit, that the
pestilential error may be first condemned, and then the restitution of
him, who has so unwisely erred, discussed, but only if embracing the
true doctrine he fully and openly with his own voice and signature
condemns those heretical opinions in which his ignorance has been
ensnared:  for this he has promised in the appeal which he sent to us,
pledging himself to follow our judgment in all things <span
id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md) .  On receiving our brother and
fellow-bishop Flavian’s letter, we have replied to him at some length on
the points which he seems to have referred to us <span
id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md) :  that when this error which seems to
have arisen, has been destroyed, there may be one Faith and one and the
same confession throughout the whole world to the praise and glory of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p14.1"></span>God</span>, and
that “in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven,
and things on earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue
should confess that the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p14.2"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ is in the glory
of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p14.3"></span>God</span> the
Father <span id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) .”  Dated 13th June in
the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).
