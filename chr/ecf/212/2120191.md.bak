id="ii.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Sermon XXIV.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p2.1"></span>On the Feast of the Nativity, IV.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p3"></span>I.  *The Incarnation fulfils all its
types and promises.*

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p4"></span>The Divine goodness, dearly beloved, has
indeed always taken thought for mankind in divers manners, and in many
portions, and of His mercy has imparted many gifts of His providence to
the ages of old; but in these last times has exceeded all the abundance
of His usual kindness, when in Christ the very Mercy has descended to
sinners, the very Truth to those that are astray, the very Life to those
that are dead:  so that Word, which is co-eternal and co-equal with the
Father, might take our humble nature into union with His Godhead, and,
being born <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xiii-p4.1"></span>God</span>
of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xiii-p4.2"></span>God</span>, might
also be born Man of man.  This was indeed promised from the foundation
of the world, and had always been prophesied by many intimations of
facts and words <span id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md) :  but how small
a portion of mankind would these types and fore-shadowed mysteries have
saved, had not the coming of Christ fulfilled those long and secret
promises:  and had not that which then benefited but a few believers in
the prospect, now benefited myriads of the faithful in its
accomplishment.  Now no longer then are we led to believe by signs and
types, but being confirmed by the gospel story we worship that which we
believe to have been done; the prophetic lore <span
id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md) assisting our knowledge, so that we
have no manner of doubt about that which we know to have been predicted
by such sure oracles.  For hence it is that the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p6.1"></span>Lord</span> says to Abraham:  “In thy seed
shall all nations be blessed <span id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md) :” 
hence David, in the spirit of prophecy, sings, saying:  “The <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xiii-p7.2"></span>Lord</span> swore truth to
David, and He shall not frustrate it:  of the fruit of thy loins will I
set upon thy seat <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md) ;” hence the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xiii-p8.2"></span>Lord</span> again says
through Isaiah:  “behold a virgin shall conceive in her womb, and shall
bear a Son, and His Name shall be called Emmanuel, which is interpreted,
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xiii-p8.3"></span>God</span> with
us <span id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md) ,” and again, “a rod shall
come forth from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall arise from his
root <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) .”  In which rod, no doubt
the blessed Virgin Mary is predicted, who sprung from the stock of Jesse
and David and fecundated by the Holy Ghost, brought forth a new <span
id="page_135">p. 135</span> <span id="ii.v.xiii-Page_135"></span>flower
of human flesh, becoming a virgin-mother.

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p11"></span>II.  *The Incarnation was the only
effective remedy to the fall.*

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p12"></span>Let the righteous then rejoice in the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xiii-p12.1"></span>Lord</span>, and let
the hearts of believers turn to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p12.2"></span>God’s</span> praise, and the sons of men
confess His wondrous acts; since in this work of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p12.3"></span>God</span> especially our humble estate
realizes how highly its Maker values it:  in that, after His great gift
to mankind in making us after His image, He contributed far more largely
to our restoration when the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p12.4"></span>Lord</span> Himself took on Him “the form of
a slave.”  For though all that the Creator expends upon His creature is
part of one and the same Fatherly love, yet it is less wonderful than
man should advance to divine things than that <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p12.5"></span>God</span> should descend to humanity.  But
unless the Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p12.6"></span>God</span> did deign to do this, no kind of
righteousness, no form of wisdom could rescue any one from the devil’s
bondage and from the depths of eternal death.  For the condemnation that
passes with sin from one upon all would remain, and our nature, corroded
by its deadly wound, would discover no remedy, because it could not
alter its state in its own strength.  For the first man received the
substance of flesh from the earth, and was quickened with a rational
spirit by the in-breathing of his Creator <span
id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md) , so that living after the image and
likeness of his Maker, he might preserve the form of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xiii-p13.2"></span>God’s</span> goodness and
righteousness as in a bright mirror.  And, if he had perseveringly
maintained this high dignity of his nature by observing the Law that was
given him, his uncorrupt mind would have raised the character even of
his earthly body to heavenly glory.  But because in unhappy rashness he
trusted the envious deceiver, and agreeing to his presumptuous counsels,
preferred to forestall rather than to win the increase of honour that
was in store for him, not only did that one man, but in him all that
came after him also hear the verdict:  “earth thou art, and unto earth
shalt thou go <span id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md) ;” “as in the
earthy,” therefore, “such are they also that are earthy <span
id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md) ,” and no one is immortal, because no
one is heavenly.

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p16"></span>III.  *We all become partakers in the
Birth of Christ, by the re-birth of baptism.*

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p17"></span>And so to undo this chain of sin and
death, the Almighty Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p17.1"></span>God</span>, that fills all things and
contains all things, altogether equal to the Father and co-eternal in
one essence from Him and with Him, took on Him man’s nature, and the
Creator and <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p17.2"></span>Lord</span> of all things deigned to be a
mortal:  choosing for His mother one whom He had made, one who, without
loss of her maiden honour, supplied so much of bodily substance, that
without the pollution of human seed the New Man might be possessed of
purity and truth.  In Christ, therefore, born of the Virgin’s womb, the
nature does not differ from ours, because His nativity is wonderful. 
For He Who is true <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p17.3"></span>God</span>, is also true man:  and there is
no lie in either nature.  “The Word became flesh” by exaltation of the
flesh, not by failure of the Godhead:  which so tempered its power and
goodness as to exalt our nature by taking it, and not to lose His own by
imparting it.  In this nativity of Christ, according to the prophecy of
David, “truth sprang out of the earth, and righteousness looked down
from heaven <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md) .”  In this nativity
also, Isaiah’s saying is fulfilled, “let the earth produce and bring
forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together <span
id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md) .”  For the earth of human flesh,
which in the first transgressor, was cursed, in this Offspring of the
Blessed Virgin only produced a seed that was blessed and free from the
fault of its stock.  And each one is a partaker of this spiritual origin
in regeneration; and to every one when he is re-born, the water of
baptism is like the Virgin’s womb; for the same Holy Spirit fills the
font, Who filled the Virgin, that the sin, which that sacred conception
overthrew, may be taken away by this mystical washing.

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p20"></span>IV.  *The Manichæans, by rejecting the
Incarnation, have fallen into terrible iniquities.*

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p21"></span>In this mystery, dear beloved, the mad
error of the Manichæans has no part, nor have they any partnership in
the regeneration of Christ, who say that He was corporeally born of the
Virgin Mary:  so that, as they do not believe in His real nativity, they
do not accept His real passion either; and, not acknowledging Him really
buried, they reject His genuine resurrection.  For, having entered on
the perilous path of their abominable dogma, where all is dark and
slippery, they rush into the abyss of death over the precipice of
falsehood, and find no sure ground on which to rest; because, besides
all their other diabolical enormities, on the very chief feast of
Christ’s worship, as their latest confession has made manifest <span
id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md) , they revel in bodily as well as
mental pollution, losing their own modesty as well as the purity of
their Faith; so that they <span id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span
id="ii.v.xiii-Page_136"></span>are found to be as filthy in their rites
as they are blasphemers in their doctrines.

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p23"></span>V.  *Other heresies contain some portion
of truth, but the Manichæans contain none whatever.*

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p24"></span>Other heresies, dearly beloved, although
they are all rightly to be condemned in their variety, yet have each in
some part of them that which is true.  Arius, in laying down that the
Son of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xiii-p24.1"></span>God</span> is
less than the Father and a creature, and in thinking that the Holy
Spirit was like all else made by the same (Father), has lost himself in
great blasphemy; but he has not denied the eternal and unchangeable
Godhead in the essence of the Father, though he could not see it in the
Unity of the Trinity.  Macedonius was devoid of the light of the Truth
when he did not receive the Godhead of the Holy Spirit, but he did
acknowledge one power and the same nature in the Father and the Son. 
Sabellius was plunged into inextricable error by holding the unity of
substance to be inseparable in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, but
granted to a singleness of nature what he should have attributed to an
equality of nature <span id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md) , and because
he could not understand a true Trinity, he believed in one and the same
person under a threefold appellation.  Photinus, misled by his mental
blindness, acknowledged in Christ true man of our substance, but did not
believe Him born <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p25.1"></span>God</span> of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p25.2"></span>God</span> before all ages, and so losing
the entirety of the Faith, believed the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p25.3"></span>God</span> to have taken on Him the true
nature of human flesh in such a way as to assert that there was no soul
in it, because the Godhead Itself took its place <span
id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md) .  Thus, if all the errors which the
catholic Faith has anathematized are recanted, something is found in one
after another which can be separated from its damnable setting.  But in
the detestable dogma of the Manicheans there is absolutely nothing which
can be adjudged tolerable in any degree.

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p27"></span>VI.  *Christians must cling to the one
Faith and not be led astray.*

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p28"></span>But you, dearly beloved, whom I address
in no less earnest terms than those of the blessed Apostle Peter, “a
chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xiii-p28.1"></span>God’s</span> own
possession <span id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) ,” built upon the
impregnable rock, Christ, and joined to the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p29.2"></span>Lord</span> our Saviour by His true
assumption of our flesh, remain firm in that Faith, which you have
professed before many witnesses, and in which you were reborn through
water and the Holy Ghost, and received the anointing of salvation, and
the seal of eternal life <span id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md) .  But
“if any one preach to you any thing beside that which you have learnt,
let him be anathema <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md) :”  refuse
to put wicked fables before the clearest truth, and what you may happen
to read or hear contrary to the rule of the catholic and Apostolic
creed, judge it altogether deadly and diabolical.  Be not carried away
by their deceitful keepings of sham and pretended fasts which tend not
to the cleansing, but to the destroying of men’s souls.  They put on
indeed a cloke of piety and chastity, but under this deceit they conceal
the filthiness of their acts, and from the recesses of their ungodly
heart hurl shafts to wound the simple; that, as the prophet says, “they
may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart <span
id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md) .”  A mighty bulwark is a sound faith,
a true faith, to which nothing has to be added or taken away:  because
unless it is one, it is no faith, as the Apostle says, “one <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xiii-p32.2"></span>Lord</span>, one faith, one
baptism, one <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p32.3"></span>God</span> and Father of all, who is above
all, and through all, and in us all <span
id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md) .”  Cling to this unity, dearly
beloved, with minds unshaken, and in it “follow after” all
“holiness <span id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md) ,” in it carry out the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xiii-p34.2"></span>Lord’s</span>
commands, because “without faith it is impossible to please <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xiii-p34.3"></span>God <span
id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783.md) </span>,” and without it nothing is
holy, nothing is pure, nothing alive:  “for the just lives by
faith <span id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md) ,” and he who by the
devil’s deception loses it, is dead though living, because as
righteousness is gained by faith, so too by a true faith is eternal life
gained, as says our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p36.2"></span>Lord</span> and Saviour.  And this is life
eternal, that they may know Thee, the only true <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p36.3"></span>God</span>, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast
sent <span id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785.md) .  May He make you to
advance and persevere to the end, Who lives and reigns with the Father
and the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.  Amen.

[Next: Sermon XXVI](2120192.md)
