<p><a name="iii.v.viii.xvii-p4"></A>An address from a learned man is always profitable, because the hearer either learns what he had known himself to be ignorant of, or, what is more, comes to know what he did not know he had been ignorant of.&#160; A hearer of the latter kind I have now become, your most holy Blessedness having been minded to write to me, asking me to send you the acts of all the martyrs, which were collected in the times of Constantine, of pious memory, by Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea.&#160; But before receiving the letter of your Blessedness I did not know of these acts, whether they had been collected, or whether not.&#160; I therefore give thanks that, instructed by your most holy teaching, I have begun to know what I was ignorant of.&#160; For beside what is contained about the acts of the holy martyrs in the books of the same Eusebius, I am not aware of any collections in the archives of this our Church, or in the libraries of the city of Rome, unless it be some few things collected in one single volume.&#160; We have indeed the names of almost all the martyrs, with their passions assigned to particular days, collected in one volume; and we celebrate the solemnities of mass on such days in commemoration of them.&#160; Yet it is not indicated in this volume who each was, and how he suffered; but only his name, the place, and day, of his passion are put down.&#160; Hence it results that many of divers countries and provinces are known to have been crowned with martyrdom, as I have said, through their several days.&#160; But these we believe you have.&#160; That, however, which you wish to have sent to you we have sought for, but have not found; but, though we have not found it, we will still search, and, if it can be found, will send it.</p>

<p><a name="iii.v.viii.xvii-p6"></A>We have received with the kindliness wherewith it was sent the blessing of Saint Mark the Evangelist, nay, it may be said more truly, of Saint Peter the Apostle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1750"></A><A HREF="#fn_1750"><FONT SIZE="1">1751</FONT></A>
; and, greeting you well, we beg your Blessedness to deign to pray for us, that so we may be counted worthy to be soon delivered from present evils, and not to be excluded from future joys.</p>
