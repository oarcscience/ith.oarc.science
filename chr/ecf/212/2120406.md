<span id="iii.v.iii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.xx-p2"></span>*To Libertinus, Præfect* <span
id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) .

<span id="iii.v.iii.xx-p4"></span>Gregory to Libertinus, Præfect of
Sicily.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xx-p5"></span>From the very beginning of your
administration <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xx-p5.1"></span>God</span> has willed you to go forth to
vindicate His cause, and of His mercy has reserved for you this reward,
with praise attending it.  For it is reported that one Nasas, a most
wicked Jew, has with a temerity that calls for punishment erected an
altar under the name of the blessed Elias, and by sacrilegious seduction
has enticed many Christians to worship there; nay, has also, it is said,
acquired Christian slaves, and devoted them to his own service and
profit.  Whilst, then, he ought to have been most severely punished for
such great crimes, the glorious Justinus <span
id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) , soothed (as has been written to
us) by the charm of avarice, put off avenging the injury done to <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iii.xx-p6.1"></span>God</span>.  But let your
Glory institute a strict examination into all these things, and, if it
should be found manifest that such things have been done, make haste to
visit <span id="page_132b">p. 132b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iii.xx-Page_132b"></span>them most strictly and corporally on
this wicked Jew, in such sort that you may thereby both conciliate the
favour of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xx-p6.2"></span>God</span> to yourself, and shew yourself
by this example, to your own reward, a model to posterity.  Moreover,
set at liberty, without any equivocation, according to the injunctions
of the laws <span id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) , whatever
Christian slaves it shall appear that he has acquired; lest (which <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iii.xx-p7.1"></span>God</span> forbid) the
Christian religion should be polluted by being subjected to Jews.  Do
you therefore with all speed correct these things most strictly, that
not only may we give thanks to you for this discipline, but also bear
testimony to your goodness in case of need.

id="iii.v.iii.xx-p3.1"></span>mss.</span> *prætori*, in others
*exprætori*.  It seems probable from the contents of this letter that
Libertinus had succeeded Justinus (see I. 2) as prætor of Sicily.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xx-p7"></span> In Cod. *lib*. 1, *tit*. 10; “Judæus
servum Christianum nec comparare debebit, nec largitatis aut
alioquocunque titulo consequetur.  Quod si aliquis Judæorum…, non solum
mancipii damno multetur, verum etiam capitali sententia puniatur.” 
Eusebius also (*De Vita Constantini*, *lib*. iv. c. 27) speaks of a law
passed by Constantine forbidding Jews to have Christian slaves, and
ordering any that might be found to be set at liberty, and the Jew to be
fined.  Cf. II. 21.
