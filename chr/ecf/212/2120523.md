<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LVI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p2"></span>*To Stephen, Abbot* <span
id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669) .

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p4"></span>Gregory to Stephen, &c.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p5"></span>The account given us by Augustine,
servant of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p5.1"></span>God</span>, the bearer of these
presents, has made us joyful, in that he has told us that your Love is
vigilant as you ought to be; and he further affirms that the presbyters
and deacons and the whole congregation live in unanimity and concord. 
And, since the goodness of presidents is the salutary rule of their
subjects, we implore Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p5.2"></span>God</span> to enkindle thee always in
good works by the grace of His loving-kindness, and to keep those who
are committed to thee from all temptation of diabolical deceit, and
grant to them to live with thee in charity and in the manner of life
that pleases Him.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p6"></span>But, since the enemy of the human
race never rests from plotting against our doings, so as to deceive in
some part souls that are serving <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p6.1"></span>God</span>, therefore, most beloved
son, we exhort thee to exercise vigilantly thy anxious care, and so to
keep those who are committed to thee by prayer and heedfulness that the
prowling wolf may find no opportunity for tearing the flock:  to the end
that, when thou shalt have rendered to our <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p6.2"></span>God</span> unharmed those of whom thou
hast undertaken the charge, He may both of His grace repay thee with
rewards for thy labour and multiply in thee longings for eternal life.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p7"></span> <span id="page_205b">p.
205b</span> <span id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-Page_205b"></span>We have received
the spoons and plates which thou hast sent us, and we thank thy Charity,
because thou hast shewn how thou lovest the poor in having sent for
their use such things as they need.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p3"></span> In *Cod. Colbert*.  Stephen is
described as “abbati de monasterio quod est Lirino;” i.e. the famous
monastery on the island of that name (*<span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p3.1"></span>Lerins*) now known as *<span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p3.2"></span>L’ile de St. Honorat*.  This was
probably Stephen’s monastery.
