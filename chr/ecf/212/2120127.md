<span id="ii.iv.cxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.cxvii-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXIII.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxvii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.cxvii-p2.1"></span>To Eudocia Augusta <span
id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) , about the Monks of Palestine <span
id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) .</span>

<span id="ii.iv.cxvii-p5"></span>Leo, the bishop, to Eudocia Augusta.

<span id="ii.iv.cxvii-p6"></span>I.  *A request that she should use her
influence with the monks of Palestine in reducing them to order.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxvii-p7"></span>I do not doubt that your piety is aware
how great is my devotion to the catholic Faith, and with what care I am
bound, <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxvii-p7.1"></span>God</span>
helping me, to guard against the Gospel of truth being withstood at any
time by ignorant or disloyal men.  And, therefore, after expressing to
you my dutiful greetings which your clemency is ever bound to receive at
my hands, I entreat the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxvii-p7.2"></span>Lord</span> to gladden me with the news of
your safety, and to bring aid evermore and more by your means to the
maintenance of that article of the Faith over which the minds of certain
monks within the province of Palestine have been much disturbed; so that
to the best of your pious zeal all confidence in such heretical
perversity may be destroyed.  For what but sheer destruction was to be
feared by men who were not moved either by the principles of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxvii-p7.3"></span>God’s</span>
mysteries <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) , or by the authority
of the Scriptures, or by the evidence of the sacred places
themselves <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) .  May it advantage
then the Churches, as by <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxvii-p9.1"></span>God’s</span> favour it does advantage them,
and may it advantage the human race itself which the Word of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxvii-p9.2"></span>God</span> adopted at the
Incarnation, that you have conceived the wish to take up your abode in
that country <span id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) where the proofs of
His wondrous acts and the signs of His sufferings speak to you of our
Lord Jesus Christ as not only true <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxvii-p10.1"></span>God</span> but also true Man.

<span id="ii.iv.cxvii-p11"></span>II.  *They are to be told that the
catholic Faith rejects both the Eutychian and the Nestorian extremes. 
He wishes to be informed how far she succeeds.*

<span id="ii.iv.cxvii-p12"></span>If then the aforesaid revere and love
the name of “catholic,” and wish to be numbered among the members of the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.cxvii-p12.1"></span>Lord’s</span> body,
let them reject the crooked errors which in their rashness they have
committed, and let them show penitence <span
id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) for their wicked blasphemies and deeds
of bloodshed <span id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) .  For the
salvation of their souls let them yield to the synodal decrees which
have been confirmed in the city of Chalcedon.  And because nothing but
true faith and quiet humility attains to the understanding of the
mystery of man’s salvation, let them believe what they read in the
Gospel, what they confess in the Creed, and not mix themselves up with
unsound doctrines.  For as the catholic Faith condemns Nestorius, who
dared to maintain two persons in our one <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxvii-p14.1"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, so does it also
condemn Eutyches and Dioscorus <span id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md)
who deny that the <span id="page_91">p. 91</span> <span
id="ii.iv.cxvii-Page_91"></span>true human flesh was assumed in the
Virgin Mother’s womb by the only-begotten Word of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxvii-p15.1"></span>God</span>.

<span id="ii.iv.cxvii-p16"></span>If your exhortations have any success
in convincing these persons, which will win for you eternal glory, I
beseech your clemency to inform me of it by letter; that I may have the
joy of knowing that you have reaped the fruit of your good work, and
that they through the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.cxvii-p16.1"></span>Lord’s</span> mercy have not perished. 
Dated the 15th of June, in the consulship of the illustrious Opilio
(453).

<span id="ii.iv.cxvii-p8"></span> *Ratio sacramentorum*, it cannot be
too often repeated that to Leo and other early Fathers, all nature, and
all its phenomena, and all God’s dealings with mankind are *sacramenta*,
and capable of a sacramental (i.e. higher, inner) interpretation:  the
particular *sacramentum* he is thinking of here is the incarnation,
which he speaks of just below, as often elsewhere, as the *sacramentum
salutis humanæ* (the sacrament or mystery whereby man is saved).
