<span id="ii.v.xxxiv"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Sermon LXVIII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p2.1"></span>(On the Passion, XVII.:  delivered on the
Wednesday.)</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p3"></span>I.  *Christ’s Godhead never forsook Him
in His Passion.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p4"></span>The last discourse, dearly-beloved, of
which we desire now to give the promised portion, had reached that point
in the argument where we were speaking of that cry which the crucified
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p4.1"></span>Lord</span> uttered
to the Father:  we bade the simple and unthinking hearer not take the
words “My <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p4.2"></span>God</span>,
&c.,” in a sense as if, when Jesus was fixed upon the wood of the cross,
the Omnipotence of the Father’s Deity had gone away from Him; seeing
that <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p4.3"></span>God’s</span> and
Man’s Nature were so completely joined in Him that the union could not
be destroyed by punishment nor by death.  For while each substance
retained its own properties, <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p4.4"></span>God</span> neither held aloof from the
suffering of His body nor was made passible by the flesh, because the
Godhead which was in the Sufferer did not actually suffer.  And hence,
in accordance with the Nature of the Word made Man, He Who was made in
the midst of all is the same as He through Whom all things were made. 
He Who is arrested by the hands of wicked men is the same as He Who is
bound by no limits.  He Who is pierced with nails is the same as He Whom
no wound can affect.  Finally, He Who underwent death is the same as He
Who never ceased to be eternal, so that both facts are established by
indubitable signs, namely, the truth of the humiliation in Christ and
the truth of the majesty; because Divine power joined itself to human
frailty to this end, that <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p4.5"></span>God</span>, while making what was ours His,
might at the same time make what was His ours.  The Son, therefore, was
not separated from the Father, nor the Father from the Son; and the
unchangeable Godhead and the inseparable Trinity did not admit of any
division.  For although the task of undergoing Incarnation belonged
peculiarly to the Only-begotten Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p4.6"></span>God</span>, yet the Father was not separated
from the Son any more than the flesh was separated from the Word <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) .

<span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p6"></span>II.  *Christ’s death was voluntary on
His part, and yet in saving others He could not save Himself.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p7"></span>Jesus, therefore, cried with a loud
voice, saying, “Why hast Thou forsaken Me?” in order to notify to all
how it behoved Him not to be rescued, not to be defended, but to be
given up into the hands of cruel men, that is to become the Saviour of
the world and the Redeemer of all men, not by misery but by mercy; and
not by the failure of succour but by the determination to die.  But what
must we feel to be the intercessory power of His life Who died and rose
again by His own inherent power. <span
id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md)   For the blessed Apostle says the
Father “spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us all <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md) ;” and again, he says, “For Christ
loved the Church, and gave Himself up for her, that He might sanctify
it <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) .”  And hence the giving
up of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p10.2"></span>Lord</span> to His Passion was as much of
the Father’s as of His own will, so that not only did the Father
“forsake” Him, but He also abandoned Himself in a certain sense, not in
hasty flight, but in voluntary withdrawal.  For the might of the
Crucified restrained itself from those wicked men, and in order to avail
Himself of a secret design, He refused to avail Himself of His open
power.  For how would He who had come to destroy death and the author of
death by His Passion have saved sinners, if he had resisted His
persecutors?  This, then, had been the Jews’ belief, that Jesus had been
forsaken by <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p10.3"></span>God</span>, against Whom they had been
<span id="page_181">p. 181</span> <span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-Page_181"></span>able to commit such unholy cruelty; for
not understanding the mystery of His wondrous endurance, they said in
blasphemous mockery:  “He saved others, Himself He cannot save.  If He
be the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we
believe Him <span id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) .”  Not at your
blind will, O foolish scribes and wicked priests, was the Saviour’s
power to be displayed, nor in obedience to blasphemers’ evil tongues was
the Redemption of mankind to be delayed; for if you had wished to
recognize the Godhead of the Son of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p11.2"></span>God</span>, you would have observed His
numberless works, and they must have confirmed you in that faith, which
you so deceitfully promise.  But if, as you yourselves acknowledge, it
is true that He saved others, why have those many, great miracles, which
have been done under the public gaze, done nothing to soften the
hardness of your hearts, unless it be because you have always so
resisted the Holy Ghost as to turn all <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p11.3"></span>God’s</span> benefits towards you into your
destruction?  For even though Christ should descend from the cross, you
would yet remain in your crime.

<span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p12"></span>III.  *A transition was then being
effected from the Old to the New Dispensation.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p13"></span>Therefore the insults of empty
exultation were scorned, and the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p13.1"></span>Lord’s</span> mercy in restoring the lost
and the fallen was not turned from the path of its purpose by contumely
or reviling.  For a peerless victim was being offered to <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p13.2"></span>God</span> for the world’s
salvation, and the slaying of Christ the true Lamb, predicted through so
many ages, was transferring the sons of promise into the liberty of the
Faith.  The New Testament also was being ratified, and in the blood of
Christ the heirs of the eternal Kingdom were being enrolled; the High
Pontiff was entering the Holy of Holies, and to intercede with <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p13.3"></span>God</span> the spotless
Priest was passing in through the veil of His flesh <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) .  In fine, so evident a transition
was being effected from the Law to the Gospel, from the synagogue to the
Church, from many sacrifices to the One Victim <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md) , that, when the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p15.2"></span>Lord</span> gave up the
ghost, that mystic veil which hung before and shut out the inner part of
the Temple and its holy recess was by sudden force torn from top to
bottom <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md) , for the reason that
Truth was displacing figures, and forerunners were needless in the
presence of Him they announced.  To this was added a terrible confusion
of all the elements, and nature herself withdrew her support from
Christ’s crucifiers.  And although the centurion in charge of the
crucifixion, in fright at what he had seen, said “truly this man was the
Son of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p16.2"></span>God <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md) </span>,” yet the wicked hearts of
the Jews, which were harder than all tombs and rocks, is not reported to
have been pierced by any compunction:  so that it seems the Roman
soldiers were then readier to recognize the Son of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p17.2"></span>God</span> than the
priests of Israel.

<span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p18"></span>IV.  *Let us profit by fasting and good
works at this sacred season of the year.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p19"></span>Because, then, the Jews, deprived of
all the sanctification imparted by these mysteries, turned their light
into darkness and their “feasts into mourning <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md) ,” let us, dearly-beloved,
prostrate our bodies and our souls and worship <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p20.2"></span>God’s</span> Grace, which has been poured
out upon all nations, beseeching the merciful Father and the rich
Redeemer from day to day to give us His aid and enable us to escape all
the dangers of this life.  For the crafty tempter is present everywhere,
and leaves nothing free from his snares.  Whom, <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p20.3"></span>God’s</span> mercy helping us, which is
stretched out to us amid all dangers, we must ever with stedfast faith
resist <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090.md) so that, though he
never ceases to assail, he may never succeed in carrying the assault. 
Let all, dearly-beloved, religiously keep and profit by the fast, and
let no excesses mar the benefits of such self-restraint as we have
proved convenient both for soul and body.  For the things which pertain
to sobriety and temperance must be the more diligently observed at this
season, that a lasting habit may be contracted from a brief zeal; and
whether in works of mercy or in strict self-denial, no hours may be left
idle by the faithful, seeing that, as years increase and time glides by,
we are bound to increase our store of works, and not squander our
opportunities.  And to devout wills and religious souls <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p21.2"></span>God’s</span> Mercy will be
granted, that He may enable us to obtain that which He enabled us to
desire, Who liveth and reigneth with our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p21.3"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ His Son, and with
the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever.  Amen.
