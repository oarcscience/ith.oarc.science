<span id="ii.iv.ciii"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.ciii-p1.1"></span>Letter CVIII.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.ciii-p2.1"></span>To Theodore, Bishop of Forum Julii.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p3"></span>Leo, the bishop, to Theodore, bishop of
Forum Julii.

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p4"></span>I.   *Theodorus should not have
approached him except through his metropolitan.*

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p5"></span>Your first proceeding, when anxious,
should have been to have consulted your metropolitan on the point which
seemed to need inquiry, and if he too was unable to help you, beloved,
you should both have asked to be instructed (by us); for in matters,
which concern all the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ciii-p5.1"></span>Lord’s</span> priests as a whole, no inquiry
ought to be made without the primates.  But in order that the
consulter’s doubts may in any case be set at rest, I will not keep back
the Church’s rules about the state of penitents.

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p6"></span> <span id="page_80">p. 80</span> <span
id="ii.iv.ciii-Page_80"></span>II.  *The grace of penitence is for those
who fall after baptism.*

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p7"></span>The manifold mercy of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.ciii-p7.1"></span>God</span> so assists men
when they fall, that not only by the grace of baptism but also by the
remedy of penitence is the hope of eternal life revived, in order that
they who have violated the gifts of the second birth, condemning
themselves by their own judgment, may attain to remission of their
crimes, the provisions of the Divine Goodness having so ordained that
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.ciii-p7.2"></span>God’s</span>
indulgence cannot be obtained without the supplications of priests.  For
the Mediator between <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ciii-p7.3"></span>God</span> and men, the Man Christ Jesus,
has transmitted this power to those that are set over the Church that
they should both grant a course of penitence <span
id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460) to those who confess, and, when they
are cleansed by wholesome correction admit them through the door of
reconciliation to communion in the sacraments.  In which work assuredly
the Saviour Himself unceasingly takes part and is never absent from
those things, the carrying out of which He has committed to His
ministers, saying:  “Lo, I am with you all the days even to the
completion of the age <span id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461) :”  so
that whatever is accomplished through our service in due order and with
satisfactory results we doubt not to have been vouchsafed through the
Holy Spirit.

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p10"></span>III.  *Penitence is sure only in this
life.*

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p11"></span>But if any one of those for whom we
entreat <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.ciii-p11.1"></span>God</span>
be hindered by some obstacle and lose the benefit of immediate
absolution, and before he attain to the remedies appointed, end his days
in the course of nature, he will not be able when stripped of the flesh
to gain that which when yet in the body he did not receive.  And there
will be no need for us to weigh the merits and acts of those who have
thus died, seeing that the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ciii-p11.2"></span>Lord</span> our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ciii-p11.3"></span>God</span>, whose judgments cannot be found
out, has reserved for His own decision that which our priestly ministry
could not complete:  for He wishes His power to be so feared that this
fear may benefit all, and every one may dread that which happens to the
lukewarm or careless.  For it is most expedient and essential that the
guilt of sins should be loosed by priestly supplication before the last
day of life.

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p12"></span>IV.  *And yet penitence and
reconciliation must not be refused to men in extremis.*

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p13"></span>But to those who in time of need and in
urgent danger implore the aid first of penitence, then of
reconciliation, must neither means of amendment nor reconciliation be
forbidden:  because we cannot place limits to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ciii-p13.1"></span>God’s</span> mercy nor fix times for Him
with whom true conversion suffers no delay of forgiveness, as says <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.ciii-p13.2"></span>God’s</span> Spirit by the
prophet, “when thou hast turned and lamented, then shalt thou be
saved <span id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462) ;” and elsewhere, “Declare
thou thy iniquities beforehand, that thou may’st be justified <span
id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463) ;” and again, “For with the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.ciii-p15.2"></span>Lord</span> there is
mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption <span
id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464) .”  And so in dispensing <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.ciii-p16.2"></span>God’s</span> gifts we must
not be hard, nor neglect the tears and groans of self-accusers, seeing
that we believe the very feeling of penitence springs from the
inspiration of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ciii-p16.3"></span>God</span>, as says the Apostle, “lest
perchance <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.ciii-p16.4"></span>God</span>
will give them repentance that they may recover themselves from the
snares of the devil, by whom they are held captive at his will <span
id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465) .”

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p18"></span>V.  *Hazardous as deathbed repentance
is, the grace of absolution must not be refused even when it can be
asked for only by signs.*

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p19"></span>Hence it behoves each individual
Christian to listen to the judgment of his own conscience, lest he put
off the turning to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ciii-p19.1"></span>God</span> from day to day and fix the time
of his amendment at the end of his life; for it is most perilous for
human frailty and ignorance to confine itself to such conditions as to
be reduced to the uncertainty of a few hours, and instead of winning
indulgence by fuller amendment, to choose the narrow limits of that time
when space is scarcely found even for the penitent’s confession or the
priest’s absolution.  But, as I have said, even such men’s needs must be
so assisted that the free action of penitence and the grace of communion
be not denied them, if they demand it even when their voice is gone, by
the signs of a still clear intellect.  And if they be so overcome by the
stress of their malady that they cannot signify in the priest’s presence
what just before they were asking for, the testimony of believers
standing by must prevail for them, that they may obtain the benefit of
penitence and reconciliation simultaneously, so long as the regulations
of the Fathers’ canons be observed in reference to those persons who
have sinned against <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ciii-p19.2"></span>God</span> by forsaking the Faith.

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p20"></span>VI.  *He is to bring this letter to the
notice of the metropolitan.*

<span id="ii.iv.ciii-p21"></span>These answers, brother, which I have
given to your questions in order that nothing different be done under
the excuse of ignorance, you shall bring to the notice of your <span
id="page_81">p. 81</span> <span
id="ii.iv.ciii-Page_81"></span>metropolitan; that if there chance to be
any of the brethren who before now have thought there was any doubt
about these points, they may be instructed by him concerning what I have
written to you.  Dated June 11th in the consulship of the illustrious
Herculanus (452).
