id="iii.v.i.xi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xi-p2"></span>To John, Bishop of Urbs Vetus (Orvieto).

<span id="iii.v.i.xi-p3"></span>Gregory to John, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xi-p4"></span>Agapitus, abbot of the monastery of St.
George, informs us that he endures many grievances from your Holiness;
and not only in things that might be of service to the monastery in time
of need, but that you even prohibit the celebration of masses in the
said monastery, and also interdict burial of the dead there.  Now, if
this is so, we exhort you to desist from such inhumanity, and allow the
dead to be buried, and masses to be celebrated there without any further
opposition, lest the aforesaid venerable Agapitus should be compelled to
complain anew concerning the matters referred to.
