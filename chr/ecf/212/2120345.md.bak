id="iii.v.i.xliii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xliii-p2"></span>*To Januarius, Bishop of Caralis
(Cagliari) in Sardinia* <span id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377.md) .

<span id="iii.v.i.xliii-p4"></span>Gregory to Januarius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xliii-p5"></span>Though your Fraternity in the zeal of
righteousness <span id="page_97b">p. 97b</span> <span
id="iii.v.i.xliii-Page_97b"></span>gives fitting attention to the
protection of divers persons, yet we believe that you will be the more
prone to succour those whom a letter from us may commend to you.  Know
then that Pompeiana, a religious woman, has represented to us through
one of her people that she endures many grievances continually and
unreasonably from certain men, and on this account has petitioned us to
commend her in our letters to you.  Wherefore, greeting your Fraternity
with the affection of charity that is due to you, we have felt that we
must needs commend the aforesaid woman to you, that, with due regard to
justice, thy Fraternity may not allow her to be aggrieved in any way
contrary to equity, or to be subjected to any expense unadvisedly.  But
if it should happen that she has any suits, let the matter of dispute be
debated before chosen arbitrators, and whatsoever shall be decided, let
it be so carried into effect quietly through your assistance that both
reward may accrue to you for such a work, and she who has been commended
by our letters may rejoice in having found justice.
