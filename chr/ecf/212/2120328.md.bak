<span id="iii.v.i.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXVI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xxvi-p2"></span>To Peter the Subdeacon.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxvi-p3"></span>Gregory, bishop, servant of the
servants of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxvi-p3.1"></span>God</span>, to Peter the Subdeacon.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxvi-p4"></span>The code of instructions which I gave
thee on thy going to Sicily must be diligently perused, so that the
greatest care may be taken concerning bishops, lest they mix themselves
up in secular causes, except so far as the necessity of defending the
poor compels them.  But what is inserted in the same code concerning
monks or clerics ought, I think, in no respect to be varied from.  But
let thy <span id="page_86b">p. 86b</span> <span
id="iii.v.i.xxvi-Page_86b"></span>Experience observe these things with
such great attention as may fulfil my desire in this regard.  Further,
it has come to my ears that from the times of Antoninus, the defensor,
till now, during these last ten years, many persons have endured certain
acts of violence from the Roman Church, so that some publicly complain
of their boundaries having been violently invaded, their slaves
abstracted, and their moveables carried off by force, and not by any
judicial process.  In all such cases I desire thy Experience to keep
intent watch, and whatsoever during these last ten years may be found to
have been taken away by violence, or retained unjustly in the name of
the Church, to restore it by authority of this my order to him to whom
it is found to belong; lest he who has suffered violence should be
obliged to come to me, and undertake the labour of so long a journey, in
which case it could not be ascertained here before me whether or not he
spoke the truth.  Having regard, then, to the majesty of the Judge who
is to come, restore all things that have been sinfully taken away,
knowing that thou bringest great gain to me, if thou gatherest
\[heavenly\] reward rather than riches.  But we have ascertained that
what the greater part complain of is the loss of their slaves, saying
that, if any man’s bondman, peradventure running away from his master,
has declared himself to belong to the Church, the rectors <span
id="fr_1332"></span>[1333](#fn_1332.md) of the Church have at once kept him
as a bondman belonging to the Church, without any trial of the case, but
supporting with a high hand the word of the bondman.  This displeases me
as much as it is abhorrent from the judgment of truth.  Wherefore I
desire thy Experience to correct without delay whatever may be found to
have been so done:  and it is also fit that any such slaves as are now
kept in ecclesiastical possession, as they were taken away without
trial, should be restored before trial; so that, if holy Church has any
legitimate claim to them, their possessors may then be dispossessed by
regular process of law.  Correct all these things irretractably, since
thou wilt be truly a soldier of the blessed apostle Peter if in his
causes thou keep guard over the truth, even without his receiving
anything.  But, if thou seest anything that may justly be claimed as
belonging to the Church, beware lest thou ever try to assert such claim
by force; especially as I have established a decree under pain of
anathema, that *tituli* may not ever be put by our Church on any urban
or rural farm <span id="fr_1333"></span>[1334](#fn_1333.md) ; but whatever
may in reason be claimed for the poor ought also to be defended by
reason; lest, a good thing being done in a manner that is not good, we
be convicted of injustice before Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxvi-p6.1"></span>God</span> even in what we justly seek. 
Moreover, I pray thee, let noble laymen, and the glorious
\[Prætor\] <span id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md) love thee for thy
humility, not dread thee for thy pride.  And yet, if by any chance thou
knowest them to be doing any injustice to the indigent, turn thy
humility at once into exaltation, so as to be always submissive to them
when they do well, and opposed to them when they do ill.  But so behave
that neither thy humility be remiss nor thy authority stiff, to the end
that uprightness season humility, and humility render thy very
uprightness gentle.  Further, since it has been customary for bishops to
assemble here for the anniversary <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) of the pontiff, forbid their coming
for the day of my ordination, since foolish and vain superfluity
delights me not.  But if they must needs assemble, let them come for the
anniversary <span id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md) of Peter, the
prince of the apostles, to render thanks to him by whose bounty they are
pastors.  Farewell.  Given this XVII day of the Kalends of April, in the
ninth year of the Emperor Mauricius.
