<span id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Epistle LVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p2"></span>*To all the Bishops throughout
Helladia* <span id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625.md) .

<span id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p4"></span>Gregory to all bishops constituted in
the province of Helladia.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p5"></span>I return thanks with you, dearest
brethren, to Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p5.1"></span>God</span>, who has caused the hidden sore
which the ancient enemy had introduced to come to the knowledge of all,
and has cut it away by a wholesome incision from the body of His
Church.  Herein we have cause both to rejoice and to mourn; to rejoice,
that is, for <span id="page_187b">p. 187b</span> <span
id="iii.v.v.xxxi-Page_187b"></span>the correction of a crime, but to
mourn for the fall of a brother.  But, since for the most part the fall
of one is wont to be the safeguard of another, whosoever fears to fall,
let him give heed to this, that he afford no way of approach to the
enemy, nor think that deeds done lie hidden.  For the Truth proclaims,
*There is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed* ([Matth. x.
26](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p5.2"></span>).  For this voice is already the herald
of our doings, and He himself, being witness, brings in all ways to
public view what is done in secret.  And who may strive to hide his
deeds before Him Who is both their witness and their judge?  But, since
sometimes, when one thing is attended to, another is not guarded
against, it behoves every one to be watchful against all the snares of
the enemy, lest, while he conquers in one point he be vanquished in
another.  For an earthly enemy too, when he desires to invade fortified
places, thus employs the art of warfare.  For indeed he lays ambushes
latently; but shews himself as though entirely bent on the storming of
one place, so that, while there is a running together for defence of
that place where the danger is imminent, other places about which there
is no suspicion may be taken.  And the result is, that he who, when
perceived, was repulsed by the valour of his opponent, obtains by
stealth what he could not obtain by fighting.  But, since in all these
things there is need of the aid of divine protection, let every one of
us cry to the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p5.3"></span>Lord</span> with the voice of the heart,
saying, *<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p5.4"></span>Lord</span>, remove not Thy help far from
me; Look Thou to my defence* ([Psa.
22.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p5.5"></span>) <span
id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626.md) .  For it is manifest that, unless
He Himself should help, and defend those who cry to Him, our enemy
cannot be vanquished.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p7"></span>Furthermore, know ye that, having
received the letter of your Charity through Andrew our brother and
fellow-bishop, we have transmitted the pallium to John our brother, the
bishop of the Corinthians; whom it is by all means fitting that you
should obey, especially as the order of ancient custom claims this, and
his good qualities, to which you yourselves bear testimony, invite it. 
For from the account given me by certain persons I have learnt that in
those parts no one attains to any sacred order without the giving of a
consideration.  If this is so, I say with tears, I declare with groans,
that, when the priestly order has fallen inwardly, neither will it be
able to stand long outwardly.  For we know from the Gospel what our
Redeemer did in person; how He went into the temple, and overthrew the
seats of them that sold doves.  For in truth to sell doves is to receive
a temporal consideration for the Holy Spirit, whom, being consubstantial
with Himself, Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p7.1"></span>God</span> gives to men through imposition
of hands.  And, as I have said before, what follows from this evil is
intimated; for the seats of them that presumed to sell doves in the
temple of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p7.2"></span>God</span> fell by <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p7.3"></span>God’s</span> judgment.  And in truth this
transgression is propagated with increase among subordinates.  For he
who is advanced to a sacred order already tainted in the very root of
his promotion is himself more prepared to sell to others what he has
bought.  And where is that which is written, *Freely ye have received;
freely give* ([Matth. x. 8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xxxi-p7.4"></span>)?  And, since the simoniacal heresy was
the first to arise against the holy Church, why is it not considered,
why is it not seen, that whosoever ordains any one for a price in
promoting him causes him to become a heretic?  And so we exhort that
none of you suffer this to be done any more; or dare to promote any to
sacred orders for the favour or supplication of any person, except such
a one as the character of his life and actions has shewn to be worthy. 
For, if we should perceive the contrary in future, know ye that it will
be repressed with strict and canonical punishment.  Given on the 15th
day of the month of August, Indiction 13.
