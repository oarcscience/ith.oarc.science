 which he sent us, he reserved to himself the right of earning our forgiveness by promising to correct whatever our opinion disapproved of in his opinion.&#160; But what the catholic Church universally believes and teaches on the mystery of the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxix-p7.1"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> Incarnation is contained more fully in the letter which I have sent to my brother and fellow-bishop Flavian.&#160; Dated 13th June in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).</p>
