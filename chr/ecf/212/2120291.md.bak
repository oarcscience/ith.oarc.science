<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p2"></span>How those are to be admonished who
sin from sudden impulse and those who sin deliberately.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p3"></span>(*Admonition* 33.).  Differently
to be admonished are those who are overcome by sudden passion and those
who are bound in guilt of set purpose.  For those whom sudden passion
overcomes are to be admonished to regard themselves as daily set in the
warfare of the present life, and to protect the heart, which cannot
foresee wounds, with the shield of anxious fear; to dread the hidden
darts of the ambushed foe, and, in so dark a contest, to guard with
continual attention the inward camp of the soul.  For, if the heart is
left destitute of the solicitude of circumspection, it is laid open to
wounds; since the crafty enemy strikes the breast the more freely as he
catches it bare of the breastplate of forethought.  Those who are
overcome by sudden passion are to be admonished to cease caring too much
for earthly things; since, while they entangle their attention
immoderately in transitory things, they are not aware of the darts of
sins which pierce them.  Whence, also, the utterance of one that is
stricken and yet sleeps is expressed by Solomon, who says, *They have
beaten me, and I was not pained; they have dragged me, and I felt it
not.  When shall I awake and again find wine* ([Prov. xxiii.
35](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#035.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p3.1"></span>)?  For the soul that sleeps from the
care of its solicitude is beaten and feels not pain, because, as it
foresees not impending evils, so neither is it aware of those which it
has perpetrated.  It is dragged, and in no wise feels it, because it is
led by the allurements of vices, and yet is not roused to keep guard
over itself.  But again it wishes to awake, that it may again find wine,
because, although weighed down by the sleep of its torpor from keeping
guard over itself, it still strives to be awake to the cares of the
world, that it may be ever drunk with pleasures; and, while sleeping to
that wherein it ought to have been wisely awake, it desires to be awake
to something else, to which it might have laudably slept.  Hence it is
written previously, *And thou shalt be as one that sleepeth in the midst
of the sea, and as a steersman that is lulled to rest, having let go the
rudder* ([Prov. xxiii. 35](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#035.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p3.2"></span>).  For he sleeps in the midst of the
sea who, placed among the temptations of this world, neglects to look
out for the motions of vices that rush in upon him like impending heaps
of waves.  And the steersman, as it were, lets go the rudder when the
mind loses the earnestness of solicitude for guiding the ship of the
body.  For, indeed, to let go the rudder in the sea is to leave off
intentness of forethought among the storms of this life.  For, if the
steersman holds fast the rudder with anxious care, he now directs the
ship among the billows right against them, now cleaves the assaults of
the winds aslant.  So, when the mind vigilantly guides the soul, it now
surmounts some things and treads them down, now warily turns aside from
others, so that it may both by hard exertion overcome present dangers,
and by foresight gather strength against future struggle.  Hence, again,
of the strong warriors of the heavenly country it is said, *Every man
hath his sword upon his thigh because of fears in the night* ([Song of
Sol. 3.8](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p3.3"></span>).  For the sword is put upon the
thigh when the evil suggestion of the flesh is subdued by the sharp edge
of holy preaching.  But by the night is expressed the blindness of our
infirmity; since any opposition that is impending in the night is not
seen.  Every man’s sword, therefore, is put upon his thigh because of
fears in the night; that is, because holy men, while they fear things
which they do not see, stand always prepared for the strain of a
struggle.  Hence, again, it is said to the bride, *Thy nose is as* <span
id="page_65b">p. 65b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-Page_65b"></span>*the tower that is in Lebanon*
([Song of Sol. 7.4](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p3.4"></span>).  For the thing which we perceive
not with our eyes we usually anticipate by the smell.  By the nose,
also, we discern between odours and stenches.  What, then, is signified
by the nose of the Church but the foreseeing discernment of Saints?  It
is also said to be like to the tower that is in Lebanon, because their
discerning foresight is so set on a height as to see the struggles of
temptations even before they come, and to stand fortified against them
when they do come.  For things that are foreseen when future are of less
force when they are present; because, when every one has become more
prepared against the blow, the enemy, who supposed himself to be
unexpected, is weakened by the very fact of having been anticipated.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p4"></span>But, on the other hand, those who
of set purpose are bound in guilt, are to be admonished to perpend with
wary consideration how that, when they do what is evil of their own
judgment, they kindle stricter judgment against themselves; and that by
so much the harder sentence will smite them as the chains of
deliberation have bound them more tightly in guilt.  Perhaps they might
sooner wash away their transgressions by penitence, had they fallen into
them through precipitancy alone.  For the sin is less speedily loosened
which of set purpose is firmly bound.  For unless the soul altogether
despised eternal things, it would not perish in guilt advisedly.  In
this, then, those who perish of set purpose differ from those who fall
through precipitancy; that the former, when they fall by sin from the
state of righteousness, for the most part fall also into the snare of
desperation.  Hence it is that the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p4.1"></span>Lord</span> through the Prophet
reproves not so much the wrong doings of precipitance as purposes of
sin, saying, *Lest perchance my indignation come out as fire, and be
inflamed, and there be none to quench it because of the wickedness of
your purposes* ([Jer. iv. 4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p4.2"></span>).  Hence, again, in wrath He says, *I
will visit upon you according to the fruit of your purposes* ([Jer.
23.2](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p4.3"></span>).  Since, then, sins which are
perpetrated of set purpose differ from other sins, the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p4.4"></span>Lord</span> censures
purposes of wickedness rather than wicked deeds.  For in deeds the sin
is often of infirmity or of negligence, but in purposes it is always of
malicious intent.  Contrariwise, it is well said through the Prophet in
describing a blessed man, *And he sitteth not in the chair of
pestilence* ([Ps. i. 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxxiii-p4.5"></span>).  For a chair is wont to be the seat
of a judge or a president.  And to sit in the chair of pestilence is to
commit what is wrong judicially; to sit in the chair of pestilence is to
discern with the reason what is evil, and yet deliberately to perpetrate
it.  He sits, as it were, in the chair of perverse counsel who is lifted
up with so great elation of iniquity as to endeavour even by counsel to
accomplish evil.  And, as those who are supported by the dignity of the
chair are set over the crowds that stand by, so sins that are purposely
sought out transcend the transgressions of those who fall through
precipitancy.  Those, then, who even by counsel bind themselves in guilt
are to be admonished hence to gather with what vengeance they must at
some time be smitten, being now made, not companions, but princes, of
evil-doers.
