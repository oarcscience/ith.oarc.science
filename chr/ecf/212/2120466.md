id="iii.v.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xii-p2"></span>To Castorius, Notary.

<span id="iii.v.v.xii-p3"></span>Gregory to Castorius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.v.xii-p4"></span>Our hearing of the death of our brother
and fellow-bishop John <span id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593.md) has
greatly saddened us especially as that city at this time has lost the
solace of pastoral care.  Wherefore, since very many advantages to the
Church itself demand that, under the guidance of Christ, a priest should
be ordained without delay, we accordingly charge thy Experience to
exhort the clergy and people with all urgency that they delay not to
elect for themselves a priest to be consecrated.  This however, and
before all things, we desire thee to press upon them, that in the
general cause they regard not their own private interests.  Let there be
no venality, then, in this election, lest, while they covet rewards,
they lose their discrimination of choice and think that man worthy for
this office who may have pleased them, not by his merits, but by his
gifts.  For let them especially and absolutely know this, that he is not
only unworthy of the priesthood, but will also certainly become further
culpable, whosoever may presume to make merchandise of the gift of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xii-p5.1"></span>God</span> by thinking to
purchase it for a price.  Wherefore let not him that is liberal in
bribes, but him that is worthy for his merits, be chosen.  For the
penalty will affect both the elected and the electors, if they attempt
with sacrilegious mind to violate the purity of the priesthood. 
Moreover, whether one or two may have been elected, by all means warn
five of the senior presbyters and five of the leading people <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594.md) to come to us together.  But with
respect to the clergy, if, besides those who determine to come, you are
of opinion that the presence of any others is necessary, send them to us
without delay, that there may be no plea of excuse, nor any delay ensue,
in setting the Church in order.
