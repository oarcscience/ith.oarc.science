<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p2"></span>How the married and the single are
to be admonished.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p3"></span>(*Admonition* 28.)  Differently to
be admonished are those who are bound in wedlock and those who are free
from the ties of wedlock.  For those who are bound in wedlock are to be
admonished that, while they take thought for each other’s good, they
study, both of them, so to please their consorts as not to displease
their Maker; that they so conduct the things that are of this world as
still not to omit desiring the things that are of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p3.1"></span>God</span>; that they so rejoice in
present good as still, with earnest solicitude, to fear eternal evil;
that they so sorrow for temporal evils as still to fix their hope with
entire comfort on everlasting good; to the end that, while they know
what they are engaged in to be transitory, but what they desire to be
permanent, neither the evils of the world may break their heart while it
is strengthened by the hope of heavenly good, nor the good things of the
present life deceive them, while they are saddened by the apprehended
evils of the judgment to come.  Wherefore the mind of married Christians
is both weak and stedfast, in that it cannot fully despise all temporal
things, and yet can join itself in desire to eternal things.  Although
it lies low meanwhile in the delights of the flesh, let it grow strong
in the refreshment of supernal hope:  and, if it has the things that are
of the world for the service of its journey, let it hope for the things
that are of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p3.2"></span>God</span> for the fruit of its
journey’s end:  nor let it devote itself entirely to what it is engaged
in now, lest it fall utterly from what it ought stedfastly to hope for. 
Which thing Paul well expresses briefly, saying, *They that have wives
as though they had none, and they that weep as though they wept not, and
they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not* ([1 Cor.
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029.md),
[30](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p3.3"></span>).  For he has a wife as though he had
none who so enjoys carnal consolation through her as still never to be
turned by love of her to evil deeds from the rectitude of a better aim. 
He has a wife as though he had none who, seeing all things to be
transitory, endures of necessity the care of the flesh, but looks
forward with longing to the eternal joys of the spirit.  Moreover, to
weep as though we wept not is so to lament outward adversities as still
to know how to rejoice in the consolation of eternal hope.  And again,
to rejoice as though we rejoiced not is so to take heart from things
below as still never to cease from fear concerning the things above.  In
the same place also a little afterwards he aptly adds, *For the fashion
of this world passeth away* ([1 Cor.
7.31](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p3.4"></span>); as if he had said plainly, Love not
the world abidingly, since the world which ye love cannot itself abide. 
In vain ye fix your affections on it as though it were continuing, while
that which ye love itself is fleeting.  Husbands and wives are to be
admonished, that those <span id="page_57b">p. 57b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-Page_57b"></span>things wherein they sometimes
displease one another they bear with mutual patience, and by mutual
exhortations remedy.  *For it is written, Bear ye one another’s burdens,
and so ye shall fulfil the law of Christ* ([Galat. vi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p3.5"></span>).  For the law of Christ is Charity;
since it has from Him bountifully bestowed on us its good things, and
has patiently borne our evil things.  We, therefore, then fulfil by
imitation the law of Christ, when we both kindly bestow our good things,
and piously endure the evil things of our friends.  They are also to be
admonished to give heed, each of them, not so much to what they have to
bear from the other as to what the other has to bear from them.  For, if
one considers what is borne from one’s self, one bears more lightly what
one endures from another.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p4"></span>Husbands and wives are to be
admonished to remember that they are joined together for the sake of
producing offspring; and, when, giving themselves to immoderate
intercourse, they transfer the occasion of procreation to the service of
pleasure, to consider that, though they go not outside wedlock yet in
wedlock itself they exceed the just dues of wedlock.  Whence it is
needful that by frequent supplications they do away their having fouled
with the admixture of pleasure the fair form of conjugal union.  For
hence it is that the Apostle, skilled in heavenly medicine, did not so
much lay down a course of life for the whole as point out remedies to
the weak when he said, *It is good for a man not to touch a woman:  but
on account of fornication let every man have his own wife, and let every
woman have her own husband* ([1 Cor.
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p4.1"></span>).  For in that he premised the fear
of fornication, he surely did not give a precept to such as were
standing, but pointed out the bed to such as were falling, lest haply
they should tumble to the ground.  Whence to such as were still weak he
added, *Let the husband render unto the wife her due; and likewise also
the wife unto the husband* ([1 Cor.
7.3](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p4.2"></span>).  And, while in the most honourable
estate of matrimony allowing to them something of pleasure, he added,
*But this I say by way of indulgence, not by way of command* ([1 Cor.
7.6](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p4.3"></span>).  Now where indulgence is spoken of,
a fault is implied; but one that is the more readily remitted in that it
consists, not in doing what is unlawful, but in not keeping what is
lawful under control.  Which thing Lot expresses well in his own person,
when he flies from burning Sodom, and yet, finding Zoar, does not still
ascend the mountain heights.  For to fly from burning Sodom is to avoid
the unlawful fires of the flesh.  But the height of the mountains is the
purity of the continent.  Or, at any rate, they are as it were upon the
mountain, who, though cleaving to carnal intercourse, still, beyond the
due association for the production of offspring, are not loosely lost in
pleasure of the flesh.  For to stand on the mountain is to seek nothing
in the flesh except the fruit of procreation.  To stand on the mountain
is not to cleave to the flesh in a fleshly way.  But, since there are
many who relinquish indeed the sins of the flesh, and yet, when placed
in the state of wedlock, do not observe solely the claims of due
intercourse, Lot went indeed out of Sodom, but yet did not at once reach
the mountain heights; because a damnable life is already relinquished,
but still the loftiness of conjugal continence is not thoroughly
attained.  But there is midway the city of Zoar, to save the weak
fugitive; because, to wit, when the married have intercourse with each
other even incontinently, they still avoid lapse into sin, and are still
saved through mercy.  For they find as it were a little city, wherein to
be protected from the fire; since this married life is not indeed
marvellous for virtue, but yet is secure from punishment.  Whence the
same Lot says to the angel, *This city is near to flee unto, and it is
small, and I shall be saved therein.  Is it not a little one, and my
soul shall live in it* ([Gen. xix.
20](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p4.4"></span>)?  So then it is said to be near, and
yet is spoken of as a refuge of safety, since married life is neither
far separated from the world, nor yet alien from the joy of safety.  But
the married, in this course of conduct, then preserve their lives as it
were in a small city, when they intercede for each other by continual
supplications.  Whence it is also rightly said by the Angel to the same
Lot, *See I have accepted thy prayers concerning this thing also, that I
will not overthrow the city for the which thou hast spoken* ([Gen.
19.21](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p4.5"></span>).  For in truth, when supplication is
poured out to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p4.6"></span>God</span>, such married life is by no
means condemned.  Concerning which supplication Paul also admonishes,
saying, *Defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a
time, that ye may give yourselves to prayer* ([1 Cor. vii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p4.7"></span>).

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p5"></span>But, on the other hand, those who
are not bound by wedlock are to be admonished that they observe heavenly
precepts all the more closely in that no yoke of carnal union bows them
down to worldly cares; that, as they are free from the lawful burden of
wedlock, the unlawful weight of earthly anxiety by no means press them
down; that the last day find them all the more prepared, as it finds
them less encumbered; lest from being free and able, and yet neglecting,
to do better things, they therefore be found deserving of worse
punishment.  Let them hear how the <span id="page_58b">p. 58b</span>
<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-Page_58b"></span>Apostle, when he would train
certain persons for the grace of celibacy, did not contemn wedlock, but
guarded against the worldly cares that are born of wedlock, saying,
*This I say for your profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but
for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> without
hindrance* ([1 Cor. 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#003.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p5.2"></span>).  For from wedlock proceed earthly
anxieties; and therefore the teacher of the Gentiles persuaded his
bearers to better things, lest they should be bound by earthly anxiety. 
The man, then, whom, being single, the hindrance of secular cares
impedes, though he has not subjected himself to wedlock, has still not
escaped the burdens of wedlock.  The single are to be admonished not to
think that they can have intercourse with disengaged women without
incurring the judgment of condemnation.  For, when Paul inserted the
vice of fornication among so many execrable crimes, he indicated the
guilt of it, saying, *Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor
thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners,
shall possess the kingdom of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p5.3"></span>God</span>* ([1 Cor.
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p5.4"></span>).  And again, *But fornicators and
adulterers <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p5.5"></span>God</span> will judge* ([Heb. xiii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p5.6"></span>).  They are therefore to be
admonished that, if they suffer from the storms of temptation with risk
to their safety, they should seek the port of wedlock.  For it is
written, *It is better to marry than to burn* ([1 Cor. vii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p5.7"></span>).  They come, in fact, to marriage
without blame, if only they have not vowed better things.  For whosoever
has proposed to himself the attainment of a greater good has made
unlawful the less good which before was lawful.  For it is written, *No
man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the
kingdom of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p5.8"></span>God</span>* ([Luke ix.
62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#062.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxviii-p5.9"></span>).  He therefore who has been intent
on a more resolute purpose is convicted of looking back, if, leaving the
larger good, he reverts to the least.
