<span id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p2"></span>How the impudent and bashful are to
be admonished.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3"></span>(*Admonition* 8).  Differently to be
admonished are the impudent and the bashful.  For those nothing but hard
rebuke restrains from the vice of impudence; while these for the most
part a modest exhortation disposes to amendment.  Those do not know that
they are in fault, unless they be rebuked even by many; to these it
usually suffices for their conversion that the teacher at least gently
reminds them of their evil deeds.  For those one best corrects who
reprehends them by direct invective; but to these greater profit ensues,
if what is rebuked in them be touched, as it were, by a side stroke. 
Thus the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.1"></span>Lord</span>, openly upbraiding the
impudent people of the Jews, saying, *There is come unto thee a whore’s
forehead; thou wouldest not blush* ([Jerem. iii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.2"></span>).  But again He revives them when
ashamed, saying, *Thou shalt forget the confusion of thy youth, and
shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood; for thy Maker will
reign over thee* ([Isa. 1:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000.md), [Isa.
54:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.3"></span>).  Paul also openly upbraids the
Galatians impudently sinning, when he says, *O foolish Galatians, who
hath bewitched you* ([Galat. iii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.4"></span>)?  And again, *Are ye so foolish, that,
having begun in the Spirit, ye are now made perfect in the flesh* ([Gal.
3.3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.5"></span>)?  But the faults of those who are
ashamed he reprehends as though sympathizing with them, saying, *I
rejoiced in the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.6"></span>Lord</span> greatly, that now at the
last ye have flourished again to care for me, as indeed ye did care, for
ye lacked opportunity* <span id="page_29b">p. 29b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.viii-Page_29b"></span>([Philipp. iv.
10](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.7"></span>); so that hard upbraiding might
discover the faults of the former, and a softer address veil the
negligence of the latter.
