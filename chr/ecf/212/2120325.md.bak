<span id="iii.v.i.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xxiii-p2"></span>To Romanus, Patrician, and Exarch of
Italy.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxiii-p3"></span>Gregory to Romanus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxiii-p4"></span>Even though there were no immediate
cause for writing to your Excellency, yet we ought to shew solicitude
for your health and safety so as to learn through frequent
intercommunication what we desire to hear about you.  Besides, it has
come to our knowledge that Blandus, bishop of the city of Hortanum <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328.md) , has been detained now for a long
time by your Excellency in the city of Ravenna.  And the result is that
the Church decays, being without a ruler, and the people as being
without a shepherd; and infants there, for their sins, die without
baptism <span id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329.md) .  And again, since
we do not believe that your Excellency has detained him except on the
ground of some probable transgression, it is proper that a synod should
be held to bring to light any crime that is charged against him.  And,
if such fault is found in him as to lead to his degradation from the
priesthood, it is necessary that we should look out for another to be
ordained, lest the Church of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxiii-p6.1"></span>God</span> should remain untended, and
destitute in what the Christian religion does not allow it to be
without.  But, if your Excellency should perceive that the case is
otherwise with him than it is said to be, allow him, I pray you, to
return to his church, that he may fulfil his duty to the souls committed
to his charge.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxiii-p7"></span>The month of March; the ninth
Indiction.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxiii-p6"></span> This alleged consequence of the
bishop’s absence from his See does not imply that he alone could
administer baptism, but only that his authorization was required for its
administration.  See Bingham, Bk. II. ch. iii. Sect. 3, 4, and
references there given:  e.g. Ignat. *Ep. ad Smyrn*. n. viii., “It is
not lawful either to baptize or celebrate the Eucharist without the
bishop; but that which he allows is well-pleasing to God:”  Hieron.
*Dialog. c. Lucifer*, p. 139, “Thence it comes that, without the order
of the bishop neither presbyter nor deacon has the right of baptizing;”
*Can. Apost*. c. xxxviii., “Let the presbyters and deacons execute no
office without the knowledge of the bishop; for it is to him that the
Lord’s people are committed, and he must give an account of their
souls.”  It was usual in episcopal cities to have only one baptistery,
connected with the bishop’s church; and these all would be baptized, if
not by the bishop himself (who was accounted the chief minister of
baptism), yet under his direction and superintendence.  Cf. Bingham, Bk.
VIII., ch. vii., Sect. 6; Bk. XI., ch. vii., Sect. 12, 13.
