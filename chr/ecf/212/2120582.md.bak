<span id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p2"></span>To Leontius, Ex-Consul.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p3"></span>Gregory to Leontius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p4"></span>Since in a great house there are not
only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and
some indeed to honour but some to dishonour ([2 Tim. ii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p4.1"></span>), who can be ignorant that in the bosom
of the Universal Church some as vessels of dishonour are deputed to the
lowest uses, but others, as vessels of honour, are fitted for clean
uses.  And yet it commonly comes to pass that the citizens of Babylon
serve in task-work for Jerusalem, while the citizens of Jerusalem, that
is of the heavenly country, are deputed to the task-work of Babylon. 
For when the elect of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p4.2"></span>God</span>, endowed with moral
excellence, distinguished for moderation, seeking not their own gain,
are deputed to earthly business, what else is it but that the citizens
of holy Jerusalem serve in the work of Babylon?  And when some,
unbridled in immorality, hold places of holy dignity, and in the very
things which they seem to do well seek praise to themselves, what else
is it but that the citizens of Babylon execute the task-work of the
heavenly Jerusalem?  For so Judas, mixed with the apostles, long
preached the Redeemer of the human race, and did signs with the rest;
but, because he had been a citizen of Babylon, he executed his work as
task-work for the heavenly Jerusalem.  But on the other hand Joseph,
being carried into Egypt, served an earthly court, <span
id="page_243b">p. 243b</span> <span
id="iii.v.viii.xxi-Page_243b"></span>bore the charge of administration
in temporal things, exhibited whatever was justly due to a transitory
kingdom; but, because he was still a citizen of holy Jerusalem, he
administered the service of Babylon, as has been seen above, in the way
of task-work only.  A follower of him, good man, I believe thee to be,
knowing thee, though involved in earthly action, to act with a gentle
spirit, to keep in all respects the citadel of humility, and to give to
every one what is just.  For such good things are reported by many of
your Glory that I would fain not hear of such things, but see them:  yet
still I am fed by the good renown of him whom I am not allowed to see. 
But the woman who poured from the alabaster box, exhibiting a type of
the Holy Church, that is of all the elect, filled the house with the
ointment ([Luke vii](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#000.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p4.3"></span>.).  And we, as often as we hear
anything of good people, draw in as it were through our nostrils a
breath of sweetness.  And when Paul the Apostle said, We are a good
odour of Christ unto God ([2 Cor. ii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p4.4"></span>), it is plainly given to be understood
that he exhibited himself as a savour indeed to the present, but as an
odour to the absent.  We therefore, while we cannot be nourished by the
savour of your presence, are so by the odour of your absence.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p5"></span>For this also we greatly rejoice,
that the gifts which you sent us were not unlike your character.  For
indeed we received oil of the holy cross <span
id="fr_1760"></span>[1761](#fn_1760.md) , and wood of aloes; one to bless
by the touch, the other to give a sweet smell when kindled.  For it was
becoming that a good man should send us things that might appease the
wrath of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p6.1"></span>God</span> against us.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p7"></span>Many other things also you have sent
for our store-houses, since, as we subsist both in soul and in flesh, it
was needful that we should be sustained in both.  And yet in
transmitting these things your most sweet soul declares that it blushes
much for shame, and holds out the shield of charity before this same
shame-facedness.  But I altogether rejoice in these words, since from
this attestation of the soul I know that he can never take away what is
another’s who blushes even in bestowing what is his own.  Your gifts
however, which you call small, are great:  but I think that your Glory’s
very humility enhances them yet the more.  And you beg me to receive
them kindly.  But meanwhile recall to your memory the two mites of a
certain widow (Luke xxvii<span id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p7.1"></span>.).  For,
if she pleased <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p7.2"></span>God</span> who offered a little with a
good will, why should not he please men who with a humble mind has given
much?  Furthermore we send you, as a blessing from Saint Peter, Prince
of the apostles, a key of his most sacred sepulchre, in which is
inserted a blessing from his chains <span
id="fr_1761"></span>[1762](#fn_1761.md) , that what bound his neck for
martyrdom may loose yours from all sins.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p6"></span> “Oil of the cross” is spoken of not
infrequently from the 6th century downward as efficient for healing.  In
the *Itinerarium* attributed to Antoninus of Placentia in that century
mention is made of *ampullæ* of onyx stone containing oil being brought
into contact with the wood of the true cross which was supposed to be
preserved in Constantine’s Church on Golgotha, and the oil thereupon at
once boiling over.  It may have been oil which was believed to have thus
acquired healing virtue that was originally meant by “oil of the
cross.”  But in the following century we find notice of a belief that
oil flowed miraculously from the wood of the cross itself.  For Adamnan,
in his book *De locis sanctis* (which is mentioned by Bede, *H. E.* V.
15, as presented by him to King Aldfrid of Northumbria, and published by
Mabillon, *de S. Adamn. Act. Benedict. sæc.* iii. part ii. p. 456),
speaks of his informant, Arcuulf, a Gallic bishop, having seen at
Constantinople, a piece of the true cross which had been sent thither by
Helena, from the knots of which an odorous liquid with healing virtues
flowed.

id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p7.3"></span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.xxi-p8"></span> Filings from the supposed chains of
St. Peter, preserved at Rome, were inserted in keys for his sepulchre
(cf. IV. 30), and these keys were sent by Gregory to various persons as
valuable charms.  Cf. I. 26, note 3.
