<span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p2"></span>*To Narses, the Religious (Narsæ
Relegioso)* <span id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709.md) .

<span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p4"></span>Gregory to Narses, &c.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p5"></span>When I was sending Romanus the
guardian (*defensorem*) to the royal city, he sought long your letters,
but they could not be found:  <span id="page_223b">p. 223b</span> <span
id="iii.v.vii.xviii-Page_223b"></span>but afterwards they were found
among many letters from other persons, your Sweetness, therein telling
me of your afflictions and tribulations of spirit, and making known the
oppositions to you of bad men.  But, I pray you, in all this recall to
your mind what I believe too that you never forget, *That all who will
live godly in Christ suffer persecution.*  ([2 Tim. iii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p5.1"></span>).  And with regard to this I
confidently say that you would live less godly if you suffered
persecution less.  For let us hear what else the same teacher of the
Gentiles says to his disciples; *Yourselves know, brethren, our entrance
in unto you, that it was not in vain; for we had before suffered and
been shamefully entreated* ([1 Thess. ii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p5.2"></span>).  Lo, most sweet son, the holy
preacher declared that his entrance would have been of no effect, if he
had not been shamefully entreated; and thy Charity wishes to say good
things, but refuses to endure evil things.  Wherefore thou must needs
gird thyself up more tightly in the midst of adverse circumstances, that
adversity itself may the more increase thy desire for the love of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p5.3"></span>God</span> and thy
earnestness in good works.  So the seeds of harvests germinate the more
fruitfully for being covered over with frost; so fire is kept down by a
blast, that it may grow greater.  I know indeed that from the perverse
speeches of so many evil tongues thou endurest a violent storm, and
bearest in thy soul billows of contradictions.  But remember what the
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p5.4"></span>Lord</span> says
by the Psalmist, *I heard thee in the secret place of storm; I proved
thee at the waters of contradiction* ([Psa.
81.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p5.5"></span>) <span
id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710.md) .  For, if in the midst of them
that contradict thou doest the things that are of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p6.2"></span>God</span>, then thou art proved a true
worker.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p7"></span>Further, your most sweet Charity
has written to me that I should write something in the way of admonition
to the monasteries which, through your prayers and influence, have been
instituted by our son the lord Paul.  But, if they are vessels of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p7.1"></span>God</span>, I know
that they have through the grace of compunction a fountain of wisdom
within, and ought not to take in the little drops of my dryness. 
Further, your perfect wisdom recollects that in Paradise there was no
rain, but a fountain ascended from the midst of Paradise to water the
face of the ground.  Those souls, then, that through the grace of
compunction have a fountain in themselves have no need of rain from
another’s tongue.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p8"></span>Further, you inform me in your
letter of the passing away of the lady Esychia <span
id="fr_1711"></span>[1712](#fn_1711.md) ; and I rejoiced with great
exultation that that good soul, which laboured in a foreign country, has
arrived happily at its own.  Further, greet in my behalf my glorious
daughters, the lady Dominica and the lady Eudochia.  But, inasmuch as I
hear that it is now a long time since the aforesaid lady Dominica was
made a prioress, let your Charity watch over her in this regard; that,
as she is no longer compelled to serve in the toil of an earthy court,
she may fly perfectly from all noises of this world, devote herself
entirely to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p9.1"></span>God</span>, and leave no part of
herself outside herself; but that she also gather together as many souls
as she can to the service of her Creator, that their minds through her
word may receive the grace of compunction, and that she herself may so
much the more speedily be absolved from all her sins as, through her
life and her tongue, the souls of others also shall have broken loose
from the bands of sins.  Moreover, since no one among men in this world
is without sin (and what else is sinning but flying from <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p9.2"></span>God</span>?), I say
confidently that this my daughter also has some sins.  Wherefore, that
she may perfectly satisfy her mistress, that is eternal Wisdom, let her,
who fled alone, return with many.  For the guilt of turning away will be
imputed to no one who in returning brings back gain.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p10"></span>Further, I beg you to greet in my
behalf the lord Alexander and the lord Theodorus.  But with respect to
your saying in your letter that I ought to write to my most excellent
daughter the lady Gurdia, and her most holy daughter the lady
Theoctista <span id="fr_1712"></span>[1713](#fn_1712.md) , and their
magnificent husbands, the lord Marinus and the lord Christidorus, and to
give them some admonition about their souls, your most sweet Greatness
well knows that there are none at present in the city of Constantinople
who can translate well into Greek what has been dictated in Latin.  For
keeping to the words, but attending little to the sense, they both fail
to make the words understood and also mangle the sense.  On this account
I have written shortly to my aforesaid daughter the lady Gurdia; but
have not addressed the others.  Further, I have sent you two *camisiæ*
and four *oraria*, which I beg may be humbly <span id="page_224b">p.
224b</span> <span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-Page_224b"></span>offered, with
the blessing of St. Peter, to the aforesaid men.  Besides, a certain
person on his death has left me by will a little boy; taking thought for
whose soul, I have sent him to your Sweetness, that he may live in this
world in the service of one through whom he may be able to attain to the
liberty of heaven.  Further, I beg your most sweet Charity to visit
frequently my most beloved son, the deacon Anatolius, whom I have sent
to represent the Church in the royal city, that after the toils which he
endures in secular causes he may find rest with you in the word of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p11.1"></span>God</span>, and wipe
away the sweat of this his earthly toil as it were with a kind of white
napkin.  Commend him to all who are known to you, though I am sure that,
if he is perfectly known, he needs no commendation.  Yet do you shew
with regard to him how much you love the holy apostle Peter, and me. 
Now may Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p11.2"></span>God</span> guard your Charity, to me
most sweet, from enemies within and without, and, when it shall please
Him, bring you to heavenly kingdoms.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p3"></span> On the designation *Religiosus,*
cf. I. 61, note 7.  The Narses here addressed as “Religiosus” was
probably the same as the “Narses Comes” of I. 6, and VI. 14, and the
“Narses Patricius” of IV. 32 (see note to I. 6).  For it is evident from
the letters that he was of high rank at Constantinople, and greetings
are sent through him to the same persons as in the other letters.  He
had now, we may suppose, devoted himself to the service of the Church in
some capacity.

<span id="fn_1710"></span>[223b:1711](2120550.htm#fr_1710.md) <span

<span id="fn_1711"></span>[223b:1712](2120550.htm#fr_1711.md) <span
id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p9"></span> Cf. I. 6, where greetings were
sent to this lady, there also designated as *Domna*.

<span id="fn_1712"></span>[223b:1713](2120550.htm#fr_1712.md) <span
id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii.xviii-p11"></span> The Emperor Maurice is said to
have had a sister called Gordia, who may have been the lady here
referred to.  Her daughter Theoctista may be concluded from the epithet
“sanctissima” to have been piously disposed; and it may have been a fear
lest her piety should suffer through the temptations of fashionable life
that had led Narses, who was himself religious, to suggest to Gregory
that he should write letters of admonition to the husbands of these
ladies, as well as to themselves.  Gregory’s reluctance to do so may
have arisen from a fear of giving offence to such distinguished people
from the purport of what he could only write in Latin being
misunderstood.  Elsewhere apparent are his caution and delicacy in
dealing with great people.
