id="ii.iv.clix-p2.1"></span>To Leo Augustus.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.clix-p3"></span>\[This letter, which is sometimes called
the Second Tome, contains the detailed statement of the catholic
doctrine of the Incarnation, which Leo had promised the Emperor in
Letter CLVI.  It consists of 9 chapters, but, as chaps. iii. to viii.
and parts of ii. and ix. are almost identical in language with Letter
CXXIV., already given in full, I have not thought it necessary to
reproduce the letter here.  At the end a long series of quotations <span
id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span id="ii.iv.clix-Page_108"></span>from
Hilary, Ambrose and other Fathers bearing upon the doctrine are also
added, but these also are dispensed with in accordance with our general
practice, as we are now presenting Leo and no one else to the reader.\]
