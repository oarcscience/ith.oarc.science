<span id="iii.v.viii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xix-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.xix-p2"></span>To Dominicus.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xix-p3"></span>Gregory to Dominicus, Bishop of
Carthage.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xix-p4"></span>The letter of your Holiness, which
we received at the hands of the bearer of these presents, so expressed
priestly moderation as to soothe us, in a manner, with the bodily
presence of its author.  Nor indeed does infrequency of communication
cause any harm where the affection of love remains uninterrupted in
one’s mind.  Great, moreover, is the power of charity, beloved brother,
which binds hearts one to another in mutual affection with the chain of
its sincerity, and suffers them not to be loosened from the cohesion of
grace, which conjoins things disjoined, keeps together things united,
and causes persons who are unknown by sight to be known through love. 
Whosoever therefore fixes his heart on the hinge of charity, him no
impulse of any adversity whatever tears from the habitation of the
heavenly country, since, in whatever direction he may turn himself, he
parts not from the threshold of the commandments.  Hence also it is said
by the excellent preacher in praise of this same charity, *Which is the
bond of perfectness* ([Coloss. iii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii.xix-p4.1"></span>).  We see, then, what great praise is
due to that which not only engenders perfectness in the soul, but also
binds it.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xix-p5"></span>Wherefore, since the language of thy
letters shews thee to be inflamed with the fire of this virtue, I
rejoice in the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xix-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> with abundant exultation,
and hope that it may shine forth in thee more and more, seeing that the
flame of the shepherd is the light of the flock.  For it becomes the
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.viii.xix-p5.2"></span>Lord’s</span>
priest <span id="fr_1753"></span>[1754](#fn_1753.md) to shine in manners
and life, to the end that the people committed to him may be able, as it
were in the mirror of his life, both to choose what to follow, and to
see what to correct.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xix-p7"></span>Knowing, furthermore, whence
priestly ordination took its beginning in the African parts, you act
laudably in recurring with wise recollection, in your love of the
Apostolic See, to the origin of your office, and in continuing with
commendable constancy in your affection towards it <span
id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754.md) .  For indeed it is certain that
whatever reverence and devotion in priestly wise you shew to it, this
you add to your own honour; seeing that you hereby invite it to be bound
with answering love to you.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xix-p9"></span>It remains, most dear brother, that
we beseech Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xix-p9.1"></span>God</span> with continual prayer that He
would direct the steps of our hearts into the pathway of His truth, and
bring us to the heavenly kingdoms, granting us by the grace of His
protection to exhibit in our works the office which we bear in name. 
The Month of August, first Indiction <span
