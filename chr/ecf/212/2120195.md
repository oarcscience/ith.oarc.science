<span id="ii.v.xvii"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>Sermon XXXI.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xvii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xvii-p2.1"></span>On the Feast of the Epiphany, I.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xvii-p3"></span>I.  *The Epiphany a necessary sequel to
the Nativity.*

<span id="ii.v.xvii-p4"></span>After celebrating but lately the day on
which immaculate virginity brought forth the Saviour of mankind, the
venerable feast of the Epiphany, dearly beloved, gives us continuance of
joy, that the force of our exultation and the fervour of our faith may
not grow cool, in the midst of neighbouring and kindred mysteries <span
id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849) .  For it concerns all men’s
salvation, that the infancy of the Mediator between <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xvii-p5.1"></span>God</span> and men was
already manifested to the whole world, while He was still detained in
the tiny town.  For although He had chosen the Israelitish nation, and
one family out of that nation, from whom to assume the nature of all
mankind, yet He was unwilling that the early days of His birth should be
concealed within the narrow limits of His mother’s home:  but desired to
be soon recognized by all, seeing that He deigned to be born for all. 
To three <span id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850) wise men, therefore,
appeared a star of new splendour in the region of the East, which, being
brighter and fairer than the other stars, might easily attract the eyes
and minds of those that looked on it, so that at once that might be
observed not to be meaningless, which had so unusual an appearance.  He
therefore who gave the sign, gave to the beholders understanding of it,
and caused inquiry to be made about that, of which He had thus caused
understanding, and after inquiry made, offered Himself to be found.

<span id="ii.v.xvii-p7"></span>II.  *Herod’s evil designs were
fruitless.  The wise men’s gifts were consciously symbolical.*

<span id="ii.v.xvii-p8"></span>These three men follow the leading of the
light above, and with stedfast gaze obeying the indications of the
guiding splendour, are led to the recognition of the Truth by the
brilliance of Grace, for they supposed that a king’s birth was notified
in a human sense <span id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851) , and that it
must be sought in a royal city.  Yet He who had taken a slave’s form,
and had come not to judge, but to be judged, chose Bethlehem for His
nativity, Jerusalem for His passion.  But Herod, hearing that a prince
of the Jews was born, suspected a successor, and was in great terror: 
and to compass the death of the Author of Salvation, pledged himself to
a false homage.  How happy had he been, if he had imitated the wise
men’s faith, and turned to a pious use what he designed for deceit. 
What blind wickedness of foolish jealousy, to think thou canst overthrow
the Divine plan by thy frenzy.  The <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xvii-p9.1"></span>Lord</span> of the world, who offers an
eternal Kingdom, seeks not a temporal.  Why dost thou attempt to change
the unchangeable order of things ordained, and to forestall others in
their crime?  The death of Christ belongs not to thy time.  The Gospel
must be first set on foot, the Kingdom of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xvii-p9.2"></span>God</span> first preached, healings first
given to the sick, wondrous acts first performed.  Why dost thou wish
thyself to have the blame of what will belong to another’s work, and why
without being able to effect thy wicked design, dost thou bring on
thyself alone the charge of wishing the evil?  Thou gainest nothing and
carriest out nothing by this intriguing.  He that was born voluntarily
shall die of His own free will.  The Wise men, therefore, fulfil their
desire, and come to the child, the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xvii-p9.3"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, the same star going
before them.  They adore the Word in flesh, the Wisdom in infancy, the
Power in weakness, the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xvii-p9.4"></span>Lord</span> of majesty in the reality of man:
 and by their gifts make <span id="page_145">p. 145</span> <span
id="ii.v.xvii-Page_145"></span>open acknowledgment of what they believe
in their hearts, that they may show forth the mystery of their faith and
understanding <span id="fr_852"></span>[853](#fn_852) .  The incense
they offer to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xvii-p10.1"></span>God</span>, the myrrh to Man, the gold to
the King, consciously paying honour to the Divine and human Nature in
union:  because while each substance had its own properties, there was
no difference in the power <span id="fr_853"></span>[854](#fn_853) of
either.

<span id="ii.v.xvii-p12"></span>III.  *The massacre of the innocents is
in harmony with the Virgin’s conception, which again teaches us purity
of life.*

<span id="ii.v.xvii-p13"></span>And when the wise men had returned to
their own land, and Jesus had been carried into Egypt at the Divine
suggestion, Herod’s madness blazes out into fruitless schemes.  He
orders all the little ones in Bethlehem to be slain, and since he knows
not which infant to fear, extends a general sentence against the age he
suspects.  But that which the wicked king removes from the world, Christ
admits to heaven:  and on those for whom He had not yet spent His
redeeming blood, He already bestows the dignity of martyrdom.  Lift your
faithful hearts then, dearly-beloved, to the gracious blaze of eternal
light, and in adoration of the mysteries dispensed for man’s
salvation <span id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854) give your diligent
heed to the things which have been wrought on your behalf.  Love the
purity of a chaste life, because Christ is the Son of a virgin. 
“Abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul <span
id="fr_855"></span>[856](#fn_855) ,” as the blessed Apostle, present in
his words as we read, exhorts us, “In malice be ye children <span
id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856) ,” because the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xvii-p16.2"></span>Lord</span> of glory conformed Himself to
the infancy of mortals.  Follow after humility which the Son of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xvii-p16.3"></span>God</span> deigned to teach
His disciples.  Put on the power of patience, in which ye may be able to
gain <span id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857) your souls; seeing that He
who is the Redemption of all, is also the Strength of all.  “Set your
minds on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the
earth <span id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858) .”  Walk firmly along the
path of truth and life:  let not earthly things hinder you for whom are
prepared heavenly things through our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xvii-p18.2"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, who with the
Father and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth for ever and ever.  Amen.

<span id="ii.v.xvii-p6"></span> The number “three” has no further
scriptural support than the possible inference from their threefold
offerings.  It will be noticed that S. Leo knows nothing of their being
kings, though that tradition is apparently as old as Tertullian (adv.
Marc. iii. 13), see Bright’s n. 38.

<span id="ii.v.xvii-p9"></span> *Humano sensu significatum sibi regis
ortum*, “by their natural thoughts” in Bright’s translation:  but I
doubt whether the words could bear that meaning, and whether they suit
the context:  cf. Serm. XXXIV. chap. 2.

<span id="ii.v.xvii-p10"></span> *Sacramentum fidei suæ
intelligentiæque*:  here *sacramentum* seems to come nearer to the older
and more general use of the word among the Fathers, viz. symbol or sign.

It is not clear from this whether in Leo’s time the reading was future,
“ye shall win” (R.V.), or imperative, “possess ye” (A.V.).  The Vulgate
now reads *possidebitis*.
