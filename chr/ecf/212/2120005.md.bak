<span id="ii.iii.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="ii.iii.i-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iii.i-p3.1"></span>Life.</span>

<span id="ii.iii.i-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iii.i-p4.1"></span>The</span> details of Leo’s early life are
extremely scanty and uncertain.  It is probable that he was born between
390 and 400 <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iii.i-p4.2"></span>a.d. </span> There is a tradition that his
father was a Tuscan named Quintian, and that Volaterræ <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) , a town in the north of Etruria, was his
birthplace.  Of his youth we know nothing:  his writings contain no
allusions to that or to any other part of his personal history.  One may
reasonably infer from the essentially Roman character of his literary
style, from the absence of quotations out of pagan literature, and from
his self-confessed ignorance of Greek, that his education was, though
thorough after its kind, limited to Christian and Latin culture.  A
reference to the pages of any secular history of the Roman empire will
give the reader an idea of the scenes amidst which, and no doubt by the
aid of which, Leo the boy was formed and moulded into Leo Magnus, the
first great Latin-speaking pope and bishop of Rome, the first great
Italian theologian, “the final defender of the truth of our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iii.i-p5.1"></span>Lord’s</span> Person against
both its assailants <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) ” (i.e. Nestorius
and Eutyches), whom it pleased <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iii.i-p6.1"></span>God</span> in His providence to raise up in
the Western (and not as oftenest hitherto in the Eastern) portion of His
Church.  Politically, intellectually, and theologically the period in
which this great character grew up, lived and worked, was one of
transition:  the Roman Empire, learning and thought, paganism were each
alike at the last gasp, and neither in Church nor State was there any
other at all of Leo’s calibre.  This consideration will account for the
wonderful influence, partly for good and partly for bad, which his
master-mind and will was permitted to exercise on the after-ages of
Christendom.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p7"></span>During his early manhood the Pelagian
controversy was raging, and it is thought that the acolyte named Leo,
whom Augustine mentions in his letters on this subject as employed by
pope Zosimus to carry communications between Rome and the African
church, is the future pope.  Under Celestine, who was pope from 422 to
432, he was archdeacon of Rome, and he seems already to have made a name
for himself:  for Cassian, the Gallican writer whom he had urged to
write a work on the Incarnation, in yielding to his suggestion, calls
him “the ornament of the Roman church and of the Divine ministry,” and
S. Cyril (in 431, the date of the Council of Ephesus) appeals to Leo (as
Leo has himself recorded in Letter CXIX., chap. 4) to procure the pope’s
support in stopping the ambitious designs of Juvenal, bishop of
Jerusalem.  Under the next pope, Sixtus (432–440), we hear of him in
Prosper’s *Chronicon* (under the year 439) again in connexion with
Pelagianism <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) :  he seems to have
stirred up the vigilance of the pope against the crafty designs of one
Julius of Eclanum, who, having been deprived of his bishopric for
holding that heresy, was attempting to be restored without full proof of
orthodoxy.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p9"></span> <span id="page_vi">p. vi</span> <span
id="ii.iii.i-Page_vi"></span>Next year (440) was a momentous one in the
life of Leo, and in the history of the papacy.  Leo was away on one of
those political missions, which bear out our estimate of him as perhaps
the most conspicuous and popular figure of his times <span
id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) .  The powerful general Aetius Placidia, the
queen-regent’s chief adviser and *aide-de-camp*, was quarrelling (a not
unusual occurrence at this stage of the empire) with Albinus, a rival
general in Gaul.  Leo was sent to bring about a reconciliation, and
apparently with success.  In his absence Sixtus died, and it is not
surprising that without any hesitation clergy and people should have
elected Leo into his place.  A deputation was sent after him to hasten
his return, and after an interval of forty days he arrived.  The whole
church received him with acclamation, and on Sept. 29 he was ordained
both priest and 47th bishop of Rome.  His brief sermon on the occasion
is the earliest in the collection, and will be found translated on p.
115 of our selection.  His earliest extant letter belongs likewise to
the first year of his episcopate, which we have also included in our
selection:  it is addressed to the bishop of Aquileia in reproof of his
and his fellow-bishops’ remissness in dealing with Pelagianism in that
province.  Thus early did he give proof of his conception of his office,
as investing him with an authority which extended over the whole of
Christendom as the successor of S. Peter.  Still clearer proofs were
soon forthcoming.  Not to speak of a letter in a similarly dictatorial
strain to the bishops of the home provinces of Campania, Picenum, and
Etruria, which belongs to the year 443, we find him in 444 interfering,
though more guardedly, with the province of Illyricum, which was then
debatable ground between the East and West; in 445 dictating church
regulations to S. Cyril’s new successor at Alexandria, Dioscorus, his
future adversary; and in 446 and 447 asserting his authority on various
pretexts, now in Africa, now in Spain, now in Sicily; while in 444 also
occurred his famous and not very creditable encounter with Hilary,
bishop of Arles in Gaul.  The incidents in this quarrel are briefly
these:  Hilary in a provincial synod had deposed a bishop, Celidonius,
for technical irregularities in accordance with the Gallican canons. 
Celidonius appealed to Rome.  Thereupon Hilary set out in the depth of
winter on foot to Rome, but, after an ineffectual statement of his case
and some rough treatment from Leo, returned to Gaul.  Leo gave orders
that Celidonius was to be restored, and Hilary deprived of all his
metropolitical rights in the province of Vienne.  How far the sentence
was carried out is not clear.  In a later letter he desires that the
bishop of Vienne should be regarded as metropolitan, and yet he seems to
recognize Hilary’s successor, Ravennius, as still metropolitan in Letter
XL., while in 450 the bishops of the one district addressed a formal
petition for the restoration of Arles to its old rank, and the bishops
of the other a counter-petition in favour of Vienne; whereupon Leo
effected a temporary *modus vivendi* by dividing the jurisdiction
between the two sees.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p11"></span>Returning to the year 444, besides
consulting S. Cyril and Paschasinus, bishop of Lilybæum, on the right
day for keeping Easter that year (a moot point which recurred in other
years) we find Leo still taking active measures against heresy, this
time that of the Manichæans <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) .  The
followers of this sect had since 439 greatly increased at Rome, owing to
the number of refugees who came over from Carthage after its capture by
Genseric and his Vandal hosts (see Sermon XVI. 5).  They were an
universally abhorred body, and deservedly so, if all we read about them
be really true.  In 444, therefore, it was determined, if possible, to
stamp them out.  By Leo’s order a strict search was instituted
throughout the city, and the large number of those who were discovered,
were brought up for trial before a combined bench of civil and
ecclesiastical judges.  The most heinous crimes were revealed.  Those
<span id="page_vii">p. vii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.i-Page_vii"></span>who refused to recant were banished for
life and suffered various other penalties by the emperor Valentinian’s
decree, while Leo used all his influence to obtain similar treatment for
them in other parts of Christendom.  Three years later the spread of
Priscillianism, a heresy which in some points was akin to Manichæism
among other heresies, and a long account of which will be found in
Letter XV., was the occasion to which we have referred as giving a
pretext for his interference in the affairs of the Spanish church.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p13"></span>We now reach the famous Eutychian
controversy, on which Leo’s chief claim to our thanks and praise rests: 
for to his action in it the Church owes the final and complete
definition of the cardinal doctrine of the Incarnation.  The heresy of
Eutyches, as was the case with so many other heresies, sprang from the
reaction against a counter heresy.  Most of the controversies which have
again and again imperilled the cause of Christianity, have been due to
human frailty, which has been unable to keep the proportion of the
Faith.  Over-statement on the one side leads to over-statement on the
other, and thus the golden mean is lost sight of.  Eutyches, an
archimandrite (or head of a monastery) at Constantinople, had
distinguished himself for zeal during the years 428 to 431 in combating
the heresy of Nestorius, who had denied the perfect union of the Godhead
and the Manhood in the one Person, Christ Jesus.  He had objected to the
Virgin being called *Theotokos* (God-bearing), and said that
*Christotokos* (Christ-bearing) would be more correct.  This position,
as involving two persons as well as two natures in our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iii.i-p13.1"></span>Lord</span>, was condemned
by the 3rd General Council, which met at Ephesus in 431, S. Cyril being
its chief opponent.  But Eutyches in his eagerness to proclaim the Unity
of the Person of Christ fell into the opposite extreme, and asserted
that though the two natures of Christ were originally distinct, yet
after the union they became but one nature, the human being changed into
the Divine.  Eutyches appears to have been a highly virtuous person, but
possessed of a dull, narrow mind, unfit for the subtleties of
theological discussion, and therefore unable to grasp the conception of
two Natures in one Person:  and nothing worse than stupidity and
obstinacy is brought against him by his stern but clear-headed opponent
Leo.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p14"></span>The person, however, who first brought
the poor recluse’s heretical statements prominently into notice was much
more reckless and intemperate in his language.  This was Eusebius,
bishop of Dorylæum, who took the opportunity of a local synod held in
Constantinople under the presidency of the gentle Flavian, in November,
448, for other business, to petition against his former friend and ally
as a blasphemer and a madman.  The synod, after expostulating with the
accuser for his violence, at last reluctantly consented to summon
Eutyches to an account.  The summons was at least twice repeated and
disobeyed under the pretext first that he might not leave the monastery,
then that he was ill.  At last Eutyches yielded, and appeared
accompanied by a crowd of monks and soldiers and by Florentius, a
patrician for whom the weak Emperor (Theodosius II.) had been influenced
by the eunuch Chrysaphius, Eutyches’ godson, to demand a seat at the
council.  After a long conversation, in which Eutyches tried to evade a
definite statement, he was at last forced to confess that our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iii.i-p14.1"></span>Lord</span> was of two
natures before the union, but that after the union there was but one
nature (see Letter XXVIII. (Tome), chap. vi.).  As he persisted in
maintaining this position, he was condemned and thrust out of the
priesthood and Church-communion.  During the reading of the condemnation
and the breaking up of the conclave, Eutyches is alleged to have told
Florentius that he appealed to the bishops of Rome, Alexandria, and
Jerusalem.  Flavian, as president of the council, thought it his duty to
acquaint the bishops of Rome and other Sees of the first rank with what
had taken place.  For some unknown reason his letter to Leo was delayed,
and the appeal of Eutyches and a letter from the Emperor was the first
information that he received.  As might be expected from Leo’s
conception of his office, he was much incensed at this apparent neglect,
and wrote to the Emperor explaining his ignorance of the facts, and to
<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.i-Page_viii"></span>Flavian, complaining of being kept in
ignorance, and *prima facie* of Eutyches’ treatment.  Meanwhile the
delayed epistle arrived from Flavian, and the account given was enough
to satisfy Leo, who thereupon (May, 449) replied briefly expressing his
approval and promising a fuller treatment of the question.  This promise
was fulfilled next month in the shape of the world-famous “Tome,” which
forms Letter XXVIII. in the Leonine collection.  The proper significance
of this document is well expressed by Mr. Gore <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) :  it is, he says, “still more remarkable
for its contents than for the circumstances which produced it,” though
“in itself it is a sign of the times:  for here we have a Latin bishop,
ignorant of Greek, defining the faith for Greek-speaking bishops, in
view of certain false opinions of Oriental origin.”  Without reviewing
in detail the further correspondence that Leo carried on with the
various civil and ecclesiastical authorities at Constantinople (among
them being the influential and orthodox Pulcheria the Emperor’s sister),
we pass on to the events connected with the second council of Ephesus. 
Through the influence of Chrysaphius, as we have already seen, the
Emperor was all along on the side of Eutyches, and it was apparently at
his instigation and in spite of Leo’s guarded dissuasion that the
council was now convened and met in August, 449.  The bishop of Rome
excused himself from personal attendance on the score of pressing
business at home, and sent three legates with instructions to represent
his views, viz. Julius, bishop of Puteoli, Renatus, a presbyter, and
Hilary, a deacon, together with Dulcitius, a notary <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) .  They started about the middle of June,
and the Synod opened on the 8th of August, in the church of the B.V.M. 
By the Emperor’s order Dioscorus, patriarch of Alexandria, was
president, Leo’s chief representative sat next him, and Flavian was
placed only 5th, the bishop of Antioch and Jerusalem being set above
him:  130 bishops in all were admitted, those who had condemned Eutyches
being excluded.  Owing partly to the presence of the soldiery and a
number of turbulent monks under the Syrian archimandrite Barsubas, the
proceedings soon became riotous and disorderly.  The “Tome” was not read
at all, though that was the purpose of its composition.  Eutyches was
admitted to make his defence, which was received as completely
satisfactory.  The acts of the Synod of Constantinople on being read
excited great indignation.  Amid tremendous uproar Eutyches was formally
restored to communion and his former position, and the president
pronounced deposition upon Flavian and Eusebius.  Flavian appealed, and
Hilary <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) , after uttering a monosyllabic
protest, “*contradicitur*,” managed to make good his escape and carry
the lamentable tidings to his anxiously-expectant chief at Rome.  The
other bishops all more or less reluctantly subscribed the restoration of
Eutyches and the deposition of Flavian and Eusebius.  The end of Flavian
is variously recorded, but the most accurate version appears to be that
amid many blows and rough usage he was cast into prison, then driven
into exile, and that within a few days he died of the bodily and mental
injuries he had received at Epypa, a village in Lydia.  These calamitous
proceedings Leo afterwards stigmatized as *Latrocinium* (brigandage),
and the council is generally known as the Robber council of Ephesus.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p18"></span>At the time when the disastrous news
arrived at Rome, Leo was presiding over a council which he had convened;
in violent indignation he immediately dispatched letters right and left
in his own and his colleagues’ name.  There is a letter to Flavian, of
whose death of course he was not yet aware; there are others to the
archimandrites and the whole church of Constantinople, to Julian, bishop
of Cos, and to Anastasius, bishop of Thessalonica.  He used all his
influence to prevail on the Emperor to summon a fresh council, this time
in Italy, <span id="page_ix">p. ix</span> <span
id="ii.iii.i-Page_ix"></span>writing to him himself, and getting
Pulcheria on the spot, and Valentinian, his mother Placidia and his wife
Eudoxia, by letters from Rome, to assist his cause.  As yet, however,
the very stars in their courses seemed to fight against him, and the
outlook grew yet darker.  In the spring of 450 Dioscorus’ predominance
in the East had become so great that ten bishops were found to join with
him in actually excommunicating the bishop of Rome.  At the Court,
though Pulcheria remained true to the Faith, Chrysaphius still seems to
have swayed the Emperor, and to have obtained from him the edict which
was issued confirming the acts of the Ephesine council.  The fact, too,
that Flavian’s successor, Anatolius, had in the past been associated
with Dioscorus caused him not unnatural anxiety, and this feeling turned
to one of actual offence on receiving a letter from Anatolius, in which
he simply announces his consecration without asking his consent. 
Thereupon Leo demanded of the Emperor that Anatolius should make some
public proof and profession of his orthodoxy on the lines of the Tome
and other catholic statements, and in the month of July sent legates to
support this demand.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p19"></span>At this moment the horizon suddenly
brightened.  Before the arrival of the legates, Theodosius was killed by
a fall from his horse, and to the triumph of the orthodox cause, his
sister, Pulcheria (the first Roman Empress), succeeded him.  The whole
aspect of things was soon changed.  Chrysaphius was almost at once
executed, and shortly afterwards Pulcheria married and shared the
Eastern empire with Marcian, who was for bravery, wisdom and orthodoxy
an altogether suitable partner of her throne.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p20"></span>Leo’s petition for a new Synod was now
granted, but the place of meeting was to be in the East, not in the
West, as more convenient for the Emperor.  In the interval S. Flavian’s
body was brought by reverent hands to Constantinople and buried in the
church of the Apostles, and a still more hopeful sign of the
times—Anatolius and many other bishops signed the Tome.  Hitherto Leo
had asked that both councils (that which had condemned and that which
had acquitted Eutyches of heresy) should be treated as null and void,
and that the matter should be discussed *de novo*.  Now, however, he
shows a significant change of front:  the Faith, he maintains, is
decided:  nothing needs now to be done but to reject the heretics and to
use proper caution in re-admitting the penitents:  there is no occasion
for a general council.  And consequently he sends bishop Lucentius and
Basil a presbyter as legates to assist Anatolius in this matter of
rejection and re-admission.  But, as the Emperor adhered to his
determination, Leo was obliged to give way, and though still declining
to attend in person, sent bishop Paschasinus of Sicily and Boniface a
presbyter with written instructions to act with the former two as his
representatives; Julian of Cos, who from his knowledge of Greek and
Eastern affairs was a most useful addition, was also asked to be of the
number.  Nicæa in Bithynia had been fixed upon as the rendezvous, and
there on Sept. 1, 451, 520 bishops assembled <span
id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) .  The Emperor, however, was too busy and
too anxious over his military operations against Attila and the Huns to
meet them there, and therefore invites them to Chalcedon, which being on
the Bosporus was much nearer to Constantinople.  There accordingly on
Oct. 8, in the church of S. Euphemia the Martyr, the council was at last
opened.  The Emperor himself was still absent, but he was well
represented by a goodly number of state officials.  In accordance with
Leo’s request, Paschasinus, with his brother legates, presided:  next
sat Anatolius, Dioscorus, Maximus of Antioch and Juvenal of Jerusalem,
with a copy of the Gospels in the midst.  Leo’s representatives began by
trying to have Dioscorus ejected:  they only succeeded in getting him
deposed from his seat of honour and placed in the middle of the room
together with Eusebius of Dorylæum, his accuser, and Theodoret of Cyrus,
the eminent theologian, who was suspected of Nestorianizing <span
id="page_x">p. x</span> <span id="ii.iii.i-Page_x"></span>language.  The
remainder of the first day was spent in reading the acts of the Ephesine
council, which in the midst of much uproar were provisionally condemned.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p22"></span>At the second session (Oct. 10), the Tome
was read by the Imperial secretary, Veronician, and enthusiastically
received:  “Peter has spoken by Leo,” they said.  But objections being
raised by the bishops of Palestine and Illyria that the twofold Nature
was over-stated, its final acceptance was postponed for a few days, that
a committee which was nominated might reason with the dissentients.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p23"></span>At the third Session (Oct. 13),
Dioscorus, who refused to appear, was accused by Eusebius and by general
consent condemned, being deprived of his rank and office as bishop, and
the Emperor having confirmed the sentence, he was banished to Gangra in
Paphlagonia, and there three years later (in 454) died.  His successor
at Alexandria was the orthodox Proterius, who was however never
recognized by a large portion of the Egyptian Church:  even in the Synod
of Chalcedon many of the Egyptian bishops refused to sign the “Tome” at
the fourth session, on the plea that the custom of their church forbade
them to act without the consent of the archbishop, who was not yet
appointed, and the still surviving “Jacobite” schism originated with the
deposition of Dioscorus.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p24"></span>The fourth session was held on the 17th,
and the misgivings of the Palestinian and Illyrian bishops having been
quieted in the interval, the Tome was adopted.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p25"></span>In the fifth session (Oct. 24), a
difficulty arose over a definition of the Faith which had been composed,
but did not satisfy the Roman legates with regard to Eutychianism. 
However a committee, which was appointed, took it in hand again, and the
result of their labours was accepted as fully guarding against the
errors both of Nestorius and Eutyches.  The remaining sessions were
occupied with less important matters, and with drawing up the canons of
the Council, of which one—the 28th—was designed to settle the precedence
of the patriarch of Constantinople (“New Rome” as it was called), and to
give him a place second to the bishop of old Rome.  Against this
audacious innovation the Roman legates in vain protested; the bitter
pill, enwrapped in much sugar, was conveyed to Leo in the synodal
letter, and produced the most lamentable results.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p26"></span>The last meeting of the Council on Nov. 1
was graced by the attendance in full state of Marcian and Pulcheria. 
The Emperor delivered an address, and at its conclusion he and the
Empress were vociferously applauded, Marcian being styled the “second
Constantine.”

<span id="ii.iii.i-p27"></span>To return to Leo, we have letters from
Marcian, Anatolius, and Julian, all trying to carry off the difficulty
of the 28th Canon under the triumph of the Roman views in other
respects.  But Leo refused to be conciliated.  The canon, he maintains,
is in direct violation of the decrees of Nicæa (in which statement he
makes an unpardonable <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) confusion
between the Nicene canons and those of Sardica, which were often
appended to them).  With Anatolius he was especially displeased,
considering that his doubtful precedents ought to have made him
extremely careful not to offend.  He therefore ceased all communication
with him, eagerly seizing at pretexts of complaint against him, and
appointing Julian his *apocrisiarius* or resident representative and
correspondent.  All this time Marcian continued pleading and Leo
inflexible, until Anatolius at last yielded, and the matter for the time
is satisfactorily settled, though it must not be imagined that the
disputed canon was ever annulled.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p29"></span>Eutychianism still lingered on and caused
disturbances in various parts of the East, especially among the monks. 
In Palestine, Juvenal, the bishop of Jerusalem, was deposed, and the
Empress Eudocia, Theodosius II.’s widow, who was living in retirement in
that city, was suspected of favouring the rioters.  Leo therefore wrote
letters to her and to others, <span id="page_xi">p. xi</span> <span
id="ii.iii.i-Page_xi"></span>in which he restates the doctrine of the
Incarnation, endeavouring to clear up any misconceptions which the
inaccuracy of the Greek version of the Tome may possibly have caused. 
Eventually he was able to congratulate the Emperor on the restoration of
peace and order in that quarter of their empire.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p30"></span>Similar riots were reported in
Cappadocia, where the monks were led by one of their number named
George, in Constantinople itself, where the ringleaders were Carosus and
Dorotheus, and in Egypt.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p31"></span>But before we narrate the final victory
of the orthodox cause throughout Christendom against the Eutychians,
there are two events in the political world, belonging one to the year
452 and the other to 455, to which reference must be made, as showing
the remarkable prestige which Leo’s character had gained for him among
all classes of society.  When he was made pope we found him absent in
Gaul mediating between rival generals.  We now find him employed on
still harder missions.  Leo himself makes none but the slightest
indirect allusion to either of these later incidents, but this silence
is only characteristic of the man, in whom there is no trace of
vain-boasting, and who consistently sank the personality of himself as
well as of others in the principles and causes which absorbed him. 
There seems no reason, however, to doubt the substantial truth of what
Prosper and others have related.  In 452 Attila and the Huns,
notwithstanding the defeat they had sustained from Aetius at Chalons,
continued their devastating inroad into Italy.  The whole city of Rome
was paralysed with terror, and at last sent Leo with the Consular
Avienus and the Prefect Tregetius to intercede with them.  The meeting
took place on lake Benacus, and Leo’s arguments, aided, it is thought,
by rumours of threatened invasion at home, persuaded Attila to retire
beyond the Danube, on condition of receiving Honoria with a rich dowry
as his wife.  This was the last time that Attila troubled the Romans: 
for he died the next year.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p32"></span>Less than three years after this
successful encounter with the barbarian, in 455 Leo’s powerful services
were again brought into requisition by the State.  That year the
licentious Valentinian was murdered at the instigation of an enraged
husband, Maximus, who subsequently compelled the widow, Eudoxia, to
marry him.  Eudoxia, however, discovering the part Maximus had taken in
Valentinian’s death, invited the Vandals under Genseric to invade
Italy.  Maximus himself was put to death before the invaders reached
Rome:  but, when they did arrive, the panic-stricken citizens again
threw themselves into the hands of Leo, who at the head of the clergy
went forth to meet the foe outside the city.  Once more his
intercessions in some measure prevailed, but not sufficiently to prevent
the city being pillaged fourteen days.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p33"></span>We now return to more purely religious
matters.  In 457 Marcian died (his wife having pre-deceased him four
years), and was succeeded by a Thracian, named Leo <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) .  Fresh outbreaks immediately took place
both at Constantinople and at Alexandria:  at the former place they were
soon stopped, but at Alexandria they were more serious and prolonged. 
The disaffected monks set up one of their number, Timothy Ælurus (or the
Cat) in opposition to Proterius, who was soon after foully murdered in
the baptistery, to which he had fled.  This flagrant outrage at once
aroused the bishop of Rome to fresh energy in every direction:  by his
promptitude the new Emperor was stirred to action, among the other means
employed being a re-statement of the Faith in a long epistle with a
catena of patristic authority, sometimes called “the Second Tome.” 
Ælurus was deposed and banished, and another Timothy, surnamed
Solophaciolus, of well-approved orthodoxy, elected into his place.  This
satisfactory consummation was effected in 460, while a no less orthodox
successor, named Gennadius, had been found two years before, when
Anatolius died, for the See of Constantinople.  Thus <span
id="page_xii">p. xii</span> <span id="ii.iii.i-Page_xii"></span>Leo’s
joy was full at last, as his latest letters testify.  Late in the year
461 he died, after a rule of twenty-one years, during which he had won
at least one great victory for the Faith, and had given the See of Rome
a prestige, which may be said to have lasted even to the present day.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p35"></span>His body was buried in the church of S.
Peter’s, since which time it has been thrice moved to different
positions, once towards the end of the 7th century by Pope Sergius,
again in 1607, after the re-building of the church in its present form,
and lastly in 1715.  As “saint” and “confessor” from the earliest times,
as “doctor of the church” since 1754, he is commemorated in the East on
Feb. 18, in the West on April 11.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p36"></span>“It will not be wholly out of place,”
says Mr. Gore <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) , “to mention that
tradition looks back to Leo as the benefactor of many of the Roman
churches:  he is said to have restored their silver ornaments after the
ravages of the Vandals, and to have repaired the basilicas of S. Peter
and S. Paul, placing a mosaic in the latter, which represented the
adoration of the four and twenty elders:  we are told also that he built
a church of S. Cornelius, established some monks at S. Peter’s,
instituted guardians for the tombs of the Apostles, and erected a
fountain before S. Paul’s, where the people might wash before entering
the church.”

<span id="ii.iii.i-p38"></span>The only writings of Leo which are
usually accepted as authentic are his numerous Sermons and Letters. 
Certain anti-Pelagian treatises and a long tract upon Humility in the
form of a letter to Demetrias, a virgin, have been ascribed to him; but
the most important work of all the doubtful ones is a “Sacramentary,”
which is one of the earliest extant of the Roman church, and is
sometimes held to be Leo’s composition or compilation.  Many of the
collects and prayers which it contains bear a remarkable resemblance to
his teaching, and may well have come from his pen:  there is indeed good
reason for the opinion that the Collect proper, which is a distinct
feature of the Western Church, owes its origin to Leo.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p39"></span>As a theologian Leo is thoroughly Western
in type, being not speculative but dogmatic:  no one was better suited
in <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iii.i-p39.1"></span>God’s</span>
Providence to give the final completeness to the Church’s Doctrine of
the Incarnation than this clear-sighted, unimaginative, and persistent
bishop of Rome.  His theological position on the cardinal doctrines of
the Faith is identical with that of the Athanasian symbol, to the
language of which his own language often bears a close resemblance. 
With his theory of the Pope as universal Ruler of the Church in virtue
of his being the successor of S. Peter, the vast majority of
English-speaking people will have but little sympathy:  and yet it can
but be admired from an objective standpoint as a bold, grand, and almost
original <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) conception.  And there are
no doubt many smaller points of detail in his writings connected more
with discipline than with doctrine, which will now be reckoned if not as
actually objectionable, at least as arising from forgotten needs or
belonging to a byegone system:  among these may be instanced his
objection to slaves as clergy and to the celebration of the Eucharist
more than once in one day except on festivals, where the church is too
small to hold all the worshippers at once:  his advocacy of the
innovation of private instead of public confession for ordinary
penitents, and on the other hand his insisting on the old rule that
baptism should be administered only twice a year (at Easter and at
Whitsuntide):  and again the somewhat undue prominence that he gives to
fasting and almsgiving as being on a level with prayer for Lenten or
Ember exercises, and to the intercessions of the saints—particularly of
the patron saints of Rome, SS. Peter, Paul, and Lawrence.  And yet at
the same time there is very much more to <span id="page_xiii">p.
xiii</span> <span id="ii.iii.i-Page_xiii"></span>be thankful for as
instructive than to object to as obsolete or dangerous.  For on the
negative side we have no trace after all of the later direct invocation
of the saints, nor of the modern *cultus* of the B.V.M. and of relics,
while among the many positive good points in his teaching must be
reckoned his most proper theory of a bishop as not only the channel of
divine grace in virtue of ordination (*sacerdos*) but also the overseer
of the flock (*episcopus*), in virtue of the people’s choice and
approval, which is essential to his office; his strong condemnation of
the practice of usury in laity as well as clergy; his high appreciation
of corporate even more than individual action among the faithful; the
thoroughly practical view he always puts before us of the Christian
life; and above all the “singularly Christian” character of all his
sermons, in which Christ is the Alpha and Omega of all his thoughts and
of all his exhortations.  These are some of the benefits which Leo has
conferred upon the Church, and which have rightfully earned for him the
title “Great.”

<span id="ii.iii.i-p5"></span> The objection that Prosper and Leo
himself both speak of Rome as his *patria* does not seem of sufficient
weight to overthrow a tradition, which it is somewhat hard to account
for the existence of.  To a native of central Italy under the Empire,
who had spent all his public life in Rome, the Eternal city was equally
*patria*, whether it was his actual birthplace or not.  At the same time
there is no evidence that Volaterræ any more than Rome or any other
Italian city can claim the honour with certainty.
