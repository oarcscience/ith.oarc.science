id="iii.v.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Epistle X.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.v-p2"></span>*To Paulus, Bishop of Naples* <span
id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401.md) .

<span id="iii.v.ii.v-p4"></span>Gregory to Paulus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.ii.v-p5"></span>If we administer safely the priestly
office which we have received, without doubt both Divine assistance and
the affection of our spiritual sons will not be wanting to us. 
Wherefore let thy Fraternity take care to shew thyself in all things
such that the testimony which the clergy, the nobility, and all the
people together, of the city of Naples bears to thee may be strengthened
by the increase of thy goodness.  Thou oughtest, then, so to bind
thyself to continual employment in exhorting the aforesaid people that
the Divine husbandman may store in his garners the fruit of thy word,
which thou shalt have gathered from them by thy labours.  But till such
time as we shall be able, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.v-p5.1"></span>God</span> revealing to us His will, to
deliberate concerning the things which our aforesaid sons request us
should be done, we grant leave for clerics to be ordained from the ranks
of the laity, and also for manumissions to be solemnly celebrated before
thee in the same church.  Moreover we desire thee to observe without
hesitation the customs of the clerical order and of the presbyters <span
id="page_103b">p. 103b</span> <span id="iii.v.ii.v-Page_103b"></span>of
the above-named church:  and do thou also keep such diligent watch in
the instruction of the same, that, abstaining from all that is
unsuitable or unlawful, they may stand fast, under thy exhortations,
ministering with due obedience, in the service of our <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.v-p5.2"></span>God</span>.  The month of
January, the tenth Indiction.

<span id="iii.v.ii.v-p3"></span> Though called here Episcopus
Neapolitanus, it is apparent from this and other Epistles that he was as
yet only the episcopal visitor, not the regular, or cardinal, bishop of
Naples.
