<span id="iii.v.iv.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXVI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxviii-p2"></span>To Leo, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxviii-p3"></span>Gregory to Leo, Bishop of
Catana <span id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560) .

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxviii-p5"></span>We have found from the report of
many that a custom has of old obtained among you, for subdeacons to be
allowed to have intercourse with their wives.  That any one should any
more presume to do this was prohibited by the servant of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xxviii-p5.1"></span>God</span>, the deacon
of our see, under the authority of our predecessor <span
id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561) , in this way; that those who at
that time had been coupled to wives should choose one of two things,
that is, either to abstain from their wives, or on no account whatever
presume to exercise their ministry.  And, according to report,
Speciosus, then a subdeacon, did for this reason suspend himself from
the office of administration, and up to the time of his death bore
indeed the office of a notary, but ceased from the ministry which a
subdeacon should have exercised.  After his death we have learnt that
his widow, Honorata, has been relegated to a monastery by thy Fraternity
for having associated herself with a husband.  And so if, as is said,
her husband <span id="page_159b">p. 159b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iv.xxviii-Page_159b"></span>suspended himself from
ministration, it ought not to be to the prejudice of the aforesaid woman
that she has contracted a second marriage, especially if she had not
been joined to the subdeacon with the intention of abstaining from the
pleasures of the flesh.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxviii-p7"></span>If, then, you find the truth to be
as we have been informed, it is right for you to release altogether the
aforesaid woman from the monastery, that she may be at liberty to return
without any fear to her husband.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxviii-p8"></span>But for the future let thy
Fraternity be exceedingly careful, in the case of any who may be
promoted to this office, to look to this with the utmost diligence,
that, if they have wives, they shall enjoy no licence to have
intercourse with them:  but you must still strictly order them to
observe all things after the pattern of the Apostolic See.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxviii-p6"></span> This order had been given by pope
Pelagius II. <span class="sc"><span

seen fit to relax the stringency of this order in the case of existing
subdeacons who had not on their ordination pledged themselves to
chastity.
