<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Epistle LVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p2"></span>*To Theodoric and Theodebert* <span
id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671.md) .

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p4"></span>Gregory to Theodoric and Theodebert,
brethren, Kings of the Franks.  *A paribus* <span
id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672.md) .

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p6"></span>Since Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p6.1"></span>God</span> has adorned
your kingdom with rectitude of faith, and has made it conspicuous among
other nations by the purity of its Christian religion, we have conceived
great expectations of you, that you will by all means desire that your
subjects should be converted to that faith in virtue of which you are
their kings and lords.  This being so, it has come to our knowledge that
the nation of the Angli is desirous, through the mercy of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p6.2"></span>God</span>, of being
converted to the Christian faith, but that the priests in their
neighbourhood neglect them, and are remiss in kindling their desires by
their own exhortations.  On this account therefore we have taken thought
to send to them the servant of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p6.3"></span>God</span> Augustine, the bearer of
these presents, whose zeal and earnestness are well known to us, with
other servants of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p6.4"></span>God</span>.  And we have also charged
them to take with them some priests from the neighbouring parts, with
whom they may be able to ascertain the disposition of the Angli, and, as
far as <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p6.5"></span>God</span>
may grant it to them, to aid their wishes by their admonition.  Now,
that they may have it in their power to shew themselves efficient and
capable in this business, we beseech your Excellency, greeting you with
paternal charity, that these whom we have sent may be counted worthy to
find the grace of your favour.  And, since it is a matter of souls, let
your power protect and aid them; that Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p6.6"></span>God</span>, who knows that with devout
mind and with all your heart you take an interest in His cause, may
propitiously direct your causes, and after earthly dominion bring you to
heavenly kingdoms.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p7"></span>Furthermore, we request your
Excellency to hold as commended to you our most beloved son, Candidus, a
presbyter, and the rector of the patrimony of our Church, to the end
that the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, may answer you by his
intercession, while, looking to the reward, you afford your protection
in the concerns of his poor.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p3"></span> Childebert II. son of Sigebert I.
and Brunechild, who had reigned over nearly all the dominions of the
Franks in Gaul (see VI. 5, note 5), died in this year, <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.xxxix-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 596, and
was succeeded by his illegitimate son Theodebert II. as king of
Austrasia, and by his second son Theoderic II. as king of Burgundy. 
These two kings were only ten and seven years of age respectively when
their father died, and their grandmother Brunechild was appointed
guardian of the former.  Hence Gregory, writing now after the death of
Childebert, addresses formal letters in identical terms to the two
minors, but another (Ep. LIX.) to Brunechild.  See *Pedigree of Kings of
Gaul*, p. xxx.
