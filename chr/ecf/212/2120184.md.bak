<span id="ii.v.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Sermon XII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.vi-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.vi-p2.1"></span>On the Fast of The Tenth Month, I. <span
id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) </span>

<span id="ii.v.vi-p4"></span>I.  *Restoration to the Divine image in
which we were made is only possible by our imitation of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p4.1"></span>God’s</span> will.*

<span id="ii.v.vi-p5"></span>If, dearly beloved, we comprehend
faithfully and wisely the beginning of our creation, we shall find that
man was made in <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vi-p5.1"></span>God’s</span> image, to the end that he might
imitate his Creator, and that our race attains its highest natural
dignity, by the form of the Divine goodness being reflected in us, as in
a mirror.  And assuredly to this form the Saviour’s grace is daily
restoring us, so long as that which, in the <span id="page_122">p.
122</span> <span id="ii.v.vi-Page_122"></span>first Adam fell, is raised
up again in the second.  And the cause of our restoration is naught else
but the mercy of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vi-p5.2"></span>God</span>, Whom we should not have loved,
unless He had first loved us, and dispelled the darkness of our
ignorance by the light of His truth.  And the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vi-p5.3"></span>Lord</span> foretelling this by the holy Isaiah
says, “I will bring the blind into a way that they knew not, and will
make them walk in paths which they were ignorant of.  I will turn
darkness into light for them, and the crooked into the straight.  These
words will I do for them, and not forsake them <span
id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) .”  And again he says, “I was found by
them that sought Me not, and openly appeared to them that asked not for
Me <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) .”  And the Apostle John
teaches us how this has been fulfilled, when he says, “We know that the
Son of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p7.2"></span>God</span> is
come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him that is
true, and may be in Him that is true, even His Son <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) ,” and again, “let us therefore love
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p8.2"></span>God</span>, because He
first loved us <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) .”  Thus it is
that <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p9.2"></span>God</span>, by
loving us, restores us to His image, and, in order that He may find in
us the form of His goodness, He gives us that whereby we ourselves too
may do the work that He does, kindling that is the lamps of our minds,
and inflaming us with the fire of His love, that we may love not only
Himself, but also whatever He loves.  For if between men that is the
lasting friendship which is based upon similarity of character
notwithstanding that such identity of wills is often directed to wicked
ends, how ought we to yearn and strive to differ in nothing from what is
pleasing to <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p9.3"></span>God</span>. 
Of which the prophet speaks, “for wrath is in His indignation, and life
in His pleasure <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) ,” because we
shall not otherwise attain the dignity of the Divine Majesty, unless we
imitate His will.

<span id="ii.v.vi-p11"></span>II.  *We must love both <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p11.1"></span>God</span> and our neighbour,
and “our neighbour” must be interpreted in its widest sense.*

<span id="ii.v.vi-p12"></span>And so, when the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vi-p12.1"></span>Lord</span> says, “Thou shalt love the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p12.2"></span>Lord</span> thy <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p12.3"></span>God</span>, from all thy
heart and from all thy mind:  and thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself <span id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) ,” let the faithful soul
put on the unfading love of its Author and Ruler, and subject itself
also entirely to His will in Whose works and judgments true justice and
tender-hearted compassion never fail.  For although a man be wearied out
with labours and many misfortunes, there is good reason for him to
endure all in the knowledge that adversity will either prove him good or
make him better.  But this godly love cannot be perfect unless a man
love his neighbour also.  Under which name must be included not only
those who are connected with us by friendship or neighbourhood, but
absolutely all men, with whom we have a common nature, whether they be
foes or allies, slaves or free.  For the One Maker fashioned us, the One
Creator breathed life into us; we all enjoy the same sky and air, the
same days and nights, and, though some be good, others bad, some
righteous, others unrighteous, yet <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vi-p13.2"></span>God</span> is bountiful to all, kind to all,
as Paul and Barnabas said to the Lycaonians concerning <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p13.3"></span>God’s</span> Providence, “who
in generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own
ways.  And yet He left Himself not without witness, doing them good,
giving rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, and filling our hearts
with food and gladness <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) .”  But
the wide extent of Christian grace has given us yet greater reasons for
loving our neighbour, which, reaching to all parts of the whole world,
looks down on <span id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) no one, and
teaches that no one is to be neglected.  And full rightly does He
command us to love our enemies, and to pray to Him for our persecutors,
who, daily grafting shoots of the wild olive from among all nations upon
the holy branches of His own olive, makes men reconciled instead of
enemies, adopted sons instead of strangers, just instead of ungodly,
“that every knee may bow of things in heaven, of things on earth, and of
things under the earth, and every tongue confess that the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p15.1"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ is
in the glory of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vi-p15.2"></span>God</span> the Father <span
id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) .”

<span id="ii.v.vi-p17"></span>III.  *We must be thankful, and show our
thankfulness for what we have received, whether much or little.*

<span id="ii.v.vi-p18"></span>Accordingly, as <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vi-p18.1"></span>God</span> wishes us to be good, because He is
good, none of His judgments ought to displease us.  For not to give Him
thanks in all things, what else is it but to blame Him in some degree. 
Man’s folly too often dares to murmur against his Creator, not only in
time of want, but also in time of plenty, so that, when something is not
supplied, he complains, and when certain things are in abundance he is
ungrateful.  The lord of rich harvests thought scorn of his well-filled
garners, and groaned over his abundant grape-gathering:  he did not give
thanks for the size of the crop, but complained of its poorness <span
id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) .  And if the ground has been less
prolific than its wont in the seed it has reared, and the vines <span
id="page_123">p. 123</span> <span id="ii.v.vi-Page_123"></span>and the
olives have failed in their supply of fruit, the year is accused, the
elements blamed, neither the air nor the sky is spared, whereas nothing
better befits and reassures the faithful and godly disciples of Truth
than the persistent and unwearied lifting of praise to <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p19.2"></span>God</span>, as says the
Apostle, “Rejoice alway, pray without ceasing:  in all things give
thanks.  For this is the will of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vi-p19.3"></span>God</span> in Christ Jesus in all things for
you <span id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) .”  But how shall we be
partakers of this devotion, unless vicissitudes of fortune train our
minds in constancy, so that the love directed towards <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p20.2"></span>God</span> may not be puffed
up in prosperity nor faint in adversity.  Let that which pleases <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p20.3"></span>God</span>, please us too. 
Let us rejoice in whatever measure of gifts He gives.  Let him who has
used great possessions well, use small ones also well.  Plenty and
scarcity may be equally for our good, and even in spiritual progress we
shall not be cast down at the smallness of the results, if our minds
become not dry and barren.  Let that spring from the soil of our heart,
which the earth gave not.  To him that fails not in good will, means to
give are ever supplied.  Therefore, dearly beloved, in all works of
godliness let us use what each year gives us, and let not seasons of
difficulty hinder our Christian benevolence.  The <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vi-p20.4"></span>Lord</span> knows how to replenish the widow’s
vessels, which her pious deed of hospitality has emptied:  He knows how
to turn water into wine:  He knows how to satisfy 5,000 hungry persons
with a few loaves.  And He who is fed in His poor, can multiply when He
takes what He increased when He gave.

<span id="ii.v.vi-p21"></span>IV.  *Prayer, fasting and almsgiving are
the three comprehensive duties of a Christian.*

<span id="ii.v.vi-p22"></span>But there are three things which most
belong to religious actions, namely prayer, fasting, and almsgiving, in
the exercising of which while every time is accepted, yet that ought to
be more zealously observed, which we have received as hallowed by
tradition from the apostles:  even as this tenth month brings round
again to us the opportunity when according to the ancient practice we
may give more diligent heed to those three things of which I have
spoken.  For by prayer we seek to propitiate <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vi-p22.1"></span>God</span>, by fasting we extinguish the lusts
of the flesh, by alms we redeem our sins:  and at the same time <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p22.2"></span>God’s</span> image is
throughout renewed in us, if we are always ready to praise Him,
unfailingly intent on our purification and unceasingly active in
cherishing our neighbour.  This threefold round of duty, dearly beloved,
brings all other virtues into action:  it attains to <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.vi-p22.3"></span>God’s</span> image and
likeness and unites us inseparably with the Holy Spirit.  Because in
prayer faith remains stedfast, in fastings life remains innocent, in
almsgiving the mind remains kind.  On Wednesday and Friday therefore let
us fast:  and on Saturday let us keep vigil with the most blessed
Apostle Peter, who will deign to aid our supplications and fast and alms
with his own prayers through our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.vi-p22.4"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, who with the Father
and the Holy Ghost lives and reigns for ever and ever.  Amen.
