id="iii.v.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.vii-p2"></span>To Paul, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.ii.vii-p3"></span>Gregory to Paul, &c.

<span id="iii.v.ii.vii-p4"></span>I appointed thy Fraternity to preside
for the present over the church of Naples, to the end that thou mightest
convert all thou canst to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.vii-p4.1"></span>God</span> by persuasive preaching.  And,
while thou oughtest to be giving thy whole mind to this work, thou art
in haste to return before bringing forth this fruit to the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.vii-p4.2"></span>Lord</span>, and
requestest me to settle the affairs of this same church speedily, my
mind being meanwhile by no means unoccupied in this matter.  But, being
desirous of fortifying securely the well-being of this Church, I hold it
needful to consider the matter with long continued deliberation, so as
to be able to arrange its affairs by the ordination of a worthy whom
Christ may reveal to us.  Wherefore let thy Fraternity meanwhile study
to watch for the good of souls, so that the opinion I have of thee may
be strengthened by the effect of thy working.  All thou hast written
concerning the deacon Peter has now been made known to us by the
ex-consul Theodorus.  And so, now that I know that he is constant to
thee, and, according to thy testimony, studies the advantage of the
Church, he ought to be afraid of no one’s opposition or enmity, but
persevere in benefiting the Church and serving <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.vii-p4.3"></span>God</span> all the more watchfully as he
feels that others have a grudge against him; that so they may have no
power at all to injure him.  Moreover, thy Fraternity ought not
hereafter to be suspected with regard to him; since no surreptitious
proceedings will have effect on me <span
