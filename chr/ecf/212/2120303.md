<span id="iii.v.i.i-p6"></span>To all the Bishops of Sicily.

<span id="iii.v.i.i-p7"></span>Gregory, servant of the servants of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.i-p7.1"></span>God <span
id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296.md) </span>, to all the bishops
constituted throughout Sicily.

<span id="iii.v.i.i-p9"></span>We have plainly perceived it to be very
necessary that, even as our predecessors thought fit to do, we should
commit all things to one and the same person; and that, where we cannot
be present ourselves, our authority should be represented through him to
whom we send our instructions.  Wherefore, with the help of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.i-p9.1"></span>God</span>, we have
appointed Peter, subdeacon of our See, our delegate in the province of
Sicily.  Nor can we doubt as to the conduct of him to whom, with the
help of <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.i-p9.2"></span>God</span>, we
are known to have committed the charge of the whole patrimony of our
church.

<span id="iii.v.i.i-p10"></span>This also we have plainly perceived to
be a thing that ought to be done; that once in the year your whole
fraternity should assemble, at Syracuse or Catana, receiving, as we have
charged him, the honour due to you; to the end that, together with the
aforesaid Peter, subdeacon of our See, you may settle with due
discretion whatever things pertain to the advantage of the churches of
the province, or to the relief of the necessities of the poor and
oppressed, or to the admonition of all, and the correction of those
whose transgressions may peradventure be proved.  From which council far
be animosities, which are the nutriment of crimes, and may inward
grudges die away, and that discord of souls which is beyond measure
execrable.  Let concord well-pleasing to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.i-p10.1"></span>God</span>, and charity, approve you as His
priests.  Conduct all things, therefore, with such deliberation and
calmness that yours may most worthily be called an Episcopal Council.

<span id="iii.v.i.i-p8"></span> “Sanctus Gregorius primus omnium se
principio epistolarum suarum servum servorum.  Dei satis humiliter
definivit.”  (*Joan Diac. in Vit. S. Greg*. l. ii. c. 1).  The
designation, however, had been used by others before him, as by Pope
Damasus (*Ep*. IV. *ad Stephanum et Africæ Episcopos*), and Augustine
(*Ep. ad Vitalem*).  Gregory may have been the first to use it
habitually.  It is true that in the *Registrum Epistolarum* we find it
four times only, viz., in the headings of Epistles I. 1, I. 36, VI. 51,
XIII. 1.  But it may have been omitted in the copies of his letters
preserved at Rome.  This is probable from the fact that it occurs in the
letters relating to the English Mission as given by Bede, though absent
from the same letters in the *Registrum*.
