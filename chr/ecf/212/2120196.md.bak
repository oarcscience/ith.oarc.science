<span id="ii.v.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p1.1"></span>Sermon XXXIII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p2.1"></span>On the Feast of the Epiphany, III.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xviii-p3"></span>I.  *When we were yet sinners, Christ
came to save.*

<span id="ii.v.xviii-p4"></span>Although I know, dearly-beloved, that
you are fully aware of the purpose of to-day’s festival, and that the
words of the Gospel <span id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859.md) have
according to use unfolded it to you, yet that nothing may be omitted on
our part, I shall venture to say on the subject what the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xviii-p5.2"></span>Lord</span> has put in my
mouth:  so that in our common joy the devotion of our hearts may be so
much the more sincere as the reason of our keeping the feast is better
understood.  The providential Mercy of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p5.3"></span>God</span>, having determined to succour the
perishing world in these latter times, fore-ordained the salvation of
all nations in the Person of Christ; in order that, because all nations
had long been turned aside from the worship of the true <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xviii-p5.4"></span>God</span> by wicked error,
and even <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xviii-p5.5"></span>God’s</span>
peculiar people Israel had well-nigh entirely fallen away from the
enactments of the Law, now that all were shut up under sin <span
id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860.md) , He might have mercy upon all.

<span id="ii.v.xviii-p7"></span>For as justice was everywhere failing
and the whole world was given over to vanity and wickedness, if the
Divine Power had not deferred its judgment, the whole of mankind would
have received the sentence of damnation.  But wrath was changed to
forgiveness, and, that the greatness of the Grace to be displayed might
be the more conspicuous, it pleased <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p7.1"></span>God</span>, to apply the mystery of
remission to the abolishing of men’s sins at a time when no one could
boast of his own merits.

<span id="ii.v.xviii-p8"></span>II.  *The wise men from the East are
typical fulfilments of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p8.1"></span>God’s</span> promise to Abraham.*

<span id="ii.v.xviii-p9"></span>Now the manifestation of this
unspeakable mercy, dearly-beloved, came to pass when Herod held the
royal power in Judea, where the legitimate succession of Kings having
failed and the power of the High-priests having been overthrown, an
alien-born had gained the sovereignty:  that the rising of the true King
might be attested by the voice of prophecy, which had said:  “a prince
shall not fail from Juda, nor a leader from his loins, until He come for
whom it is reserved <span id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md) , and He
shall <span id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span
id="ii.v.xviii-Page_146"></span>be the expectation of the nations.” 
Concerning which an innumerable succession was once promised to the most
blessed patriarch Abraham to be begotten not by fleshly seed but by
fertile faith; and therefore it was compared to the stars in multitude
that as father of all the nations he might hope not for an earthly but
for a heavenly progeny.  And therefore, for the creating of the promised
posterity, the heirs designated under the figure of the stars are
awakened by the rising of a new star, that the ministrations of the
heaven might do service in that wherein the witness of the heaven had
been adduced.  A star more brilliant than the other stars arouses wise
men that dwell in the far East, and from the brightness of the wondrous
light these men, not unskilled in observing such things, appreciate the
importance of the sign:  this doubtless being brought about in their
hearts by Divine inspiration, in order that the mystery of so great a
sight might not be hid from them, and, what was an unusual appearance to
their eyes, might not be obscure to their minds.  In a word they
scrupulously set about their duty and provide themselves with such gifts
that in worshipping the One they may at the same time show their belief
in His threefold function:  with gold they honour the Person of a King,
with myrrh that of Man, with incense that of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p10.8"></span>God <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md)
</span>.

<span id="ii.v.xviii-p12"></span>III.  *The chosen race is no longer the
Jews, but believers of every nation.*

<span id="ii.v.xviii-p13"></span>And so they enter the chief city of the
Kingdom of Judæa, and in the royal city ask that He should be shown them
Whom they had learnt was begotten to be King.  Herod is perturbed:  he
fears for his safety, he trembles for his power, he asks of the priests
and teachers of the Law what the Scripture has predicted about the birth
of Christ, he ascertains what had been prophesied:  truth enlightens the
wise men, unbelief blinds the experts:  carnal Israel understands not
what it reads, sees not what it points out; refers to the pages, whose
utterances it does not believe.  Where is thy boasting, O Jew? where thy
noble birth drawn from the stem of Abraham? is not thy circumcision
become uncircumcision <span id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md) ?  Behold
thou, the greater servest the less <span
id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md) , and by the reading of that
covenant <span id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) which thou keepest in
the letter only, thou becomest the slave of strangers born, who enter
into the lot of thy heritage.  Let the fulness of the nations enter into
the family of the patriarchs, yea let it enter, and let the sons of
promise receive in Abraham’s seed the blessing which his sons, according
to the flesh, renounce their claim to.  In the three Magi <span
id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md) let all people worship the Author of
the universe:  and let <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p17.1"></span>God</span> be known not in Judæa alone, but
in all the world, so that everywhere “His name” may be “great in
Israel <span id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) .”  For while the dignity
of the chosen race is proved to be degenerate by unbelief in its
descendants, it is made common to all alike by our belief.

<span id="ii.v.xviii-p19"></span>IV.  *The massacre of the Innocents
through the consequent flight of Christ, brings the truth into Egypt.*

<span id="ii.v.xviii-p20"></span>Now when the wise men had worshipped
the <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xviii-p20.1"></span>Lord</span> and
finished all their devotions, according to the warning of a dream, they
return not by the same route by which they had come.  For it behoved
them now that they believed in Christ not to walk in the paths of their
old line of life, but having entered on a new way to keep away from the
errors they had left:  and it was also to baffle Herod’s design, who,
under the cloke of homage, was planning a wicked plot against the Infant
Jesus.  Hence when his crafty hopes were overthrown, the king’s wrath
rose to a greater fury.  For reckoning up the time which the wise men
had indicated, he poured out his cruel rage on all the men-children of
Bethlehem, and in a general massacre of the whole of that city <span
id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md) slew the infants, who thus passed to
their eternal glory, thinking that, if every single babe was slain
there, Christ too would be slain.  But He Who was postponing the
shedding of His blood for the world’s redemption till another time, was
carried and brought into Egypt by his parents’ aid, and thus sought the
ancient cradle of the Hebrew race, and in the power of a greater
providence dispensing the princely office of the true Joseph, in that
He, the Bread of Life and the Food of reason that came down from heaven,
removed that worse than all famines under which the Egyptians’ minds
were labouring, the lack of truth <span
id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869.md) , nor without <span id="page_147">p.
147</span> <span id="ii.v.xviii-Page_147"></span>that sojourn would the
symbolism of that One Victim have been complete; for there first by the
slaying of the lamb was fore-shadowed the health-bringing sign of the
Cross and the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p22.1"></span>Lord’s</span> Passover.

<span id="ii.v.xviii-p23"></span>V.  *We must keep this festival as
thankful sons of light.*

<span id="ii.v.xviii-p24"></span>Taught then, dearly-beloved, by these
mysteries of Divine grace, let us with reasonable joy celebrate the day
of our first-fruits and the commencement of the nations’ calling: 
“giving thanks to” the merciful <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p24.1"></span>God</span> “who made us worthy,” as the
Apostle says, “to be partakers of the lot of the saints in light:  who
delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the
kingdom of the Son of His love <span id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870.md)
:”  since as Isaiah prophesied, “the people of the nations that sat in
darkness, have seen a great light, and they that dwelt in the land of
the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined <span
id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871.md) .”  Of whom he also said to the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xviii-p26.2"></span>Lord</span>, “nations
which knew not thee, shall call on thee:  and peoples which were
ignorant of thee, shall run together unto thee <span
id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872.md) .”  This day “Abraham saw and was
glad <span id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873.md) ,” when he understood that
the sons of his faith would be blessed in his seed that is in Christ,
and foresaw that by believing he should be the father of all nations,
“giving glory to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p28.2"></span>God</span> and being fully assured that
What He had promised, He was able also to perform <span
id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874.md) .”  This day David sang of in the
psalms saying:  “all nations that thou hast made shall come and worship
before Thee, O <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p29.2"></span>Lord</span>:  and they shall glorify Thy
name <span id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875.md) ;” and again:  “The <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xviii-p30.2"></span>Lord</span> hath made
known His salvation:  His righteousness hath He openly showed in the
sight of the nations <span id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876.md) .”  This in
good truth we know to have taken place ever since the three wise men
aroused in their far-off land were led by a star to recognize and
worship the King of heaven and earth, \[which to those who gaze aright
ceases not daily to appear.  And if it could make Christ known when
concealed in infancy, how much more able was it to reveal Him when
reigning in majesty\] <span id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877.md) .  And
surely their worship of Him exhorts us to imitation; that, as far as we
can, we should serve our gracious <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p32.2"></span>God</span> who invites us all to Christ. 
For whosoever lives religiously and chastely in the Church and “sets his
mind on the things which are above, not on the things that are upon the
earth <span id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878.md) ,” is in some measure like
the heavenly light:  and whilst he himself keeps the brightness of a
holy life, he points out to many the way to the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p33.2"></span>Lord</span> like a star.  In which regard,
dearly-beloved, ye ought all to help one another in turn, that in the
kingdom of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xviii-p33.3"></span>God</span>, which is reached by right faith
and good works, ye may shine as the sons of light:  through our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xviii-p33.4"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ,
Who with <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xviii-p33.5"></span>God</span>
the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns for ever and ever. 
Amen.

1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.v.xviii-p5.1"></span>:  but the manifestation of Christ to the
wise men was not universally so prominent a feature of the Festival as
other manifestations of Him, e.g. His birth (Jan. 6 having been in the
East the original Christmas Day), His baptism, &c.

thus:  “He should come for Whom the things were reserved, that is, the
Christ of <span class="sc"><span

promises.  He alone could be called the expectation of the nations, for
