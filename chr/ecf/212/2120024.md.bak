<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Letter XIV.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xiv-p2.1"></span>To Anastasius, Bishop of Thessalonica.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p3"></span>Leo, bishop of the City of Rome, to
Anastasius, bishop of Thessalonica.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p4"></span>I.  *Prefatory*.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p5"></span>If with true reasoning you perceived all
that has been committed to you, brother, by the blessed apostle Peter’s
authority, and what has also been entrusted to you by our favour, and
would weigh it fairly, we should be able greatly to rejoice at your
zealous discharge of the responsibility imposed on you <span
id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) .

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p7"></span>II.  *Anastasius is taxed with exceeding
the limits of his vicariate, especially in his violent and unworthy
treatment of Atticus.*

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p8"></span>Seeing that, as my predecessors acted
towards yours, so too I, following their example, have delegated my
authority to you <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) , beloved:  so
that you, imitating our gentleness, might assist us in the care which we
owe primarily to all the churches by Divine institution, and might to a
certain extent make up for our personal presence in visiting those
provinces which are far off from us:  for it would be easy for you by
regular and well-timed inspection to tell what and in what cases you
could either, by your own influence, settle or reserve for our
judgment.  For as it was free for you to suspend the more important
matters and the harder issues while you awaited our opinion, there was
no reason nor necessity for you to go out of your way to decide what was
beyond your powers.  For you have numerous written warnings of ours in
which we have often instructed you to be temperate in all your actions: 
that with loving exhortations you might provoke the churches of Christ
committed to you to healthy obedience.  Because, although as a rule
there exist among careless or slothful brethren things which demand a
strong hand in rectifying them; yet the correction ought to be so
applied as ever to keep love inviolate.  Wherefore also it is that the
blessed Apostle Paul, in instructing Timothy upon the ruling of the
Church, says:  “an elder rebuke not, but intreat him as a father:  the
young men as brethren:  old women as mothers:  young women as sisters in
all purity <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) .”  And if this
moderation is due by the Apostle’s precept to all and any of the lower
members, how much more is it to be paid without offence to our brethren
and <span id="page_17">p. 17</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xiv-Page_17"></span>fellow-bishops? in order that although
things sometimes happen which have to be reprimanded in the persons of
priests, yet kindness may have more effect on those who are to be
corrected than severity:  exhortation than perturbation:  love than
power.  But they who “seek their own, not the things which are Jesus
Christ’s <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) ,” easily depart from
this law, and finding pleasure rather in domineering over their subjects
than in consulting their interests, are swoln with the pride of their
position, and thus what was provided to secure harmony ministers to
mischief.  That we are obliged to speak thus causes us no small grief. 
For I feel myself in a certain measure drawn into blame, on discovering
you to have so immoderately departed from the rules handed down to you. 
If you were careless of your own reputation, you ought at least to have
spared my good name:  lest what only your own mind prompted should seem
done with our approval.  Do but read, brother, our pages with care, and
peruse all the letters sent by holders of the Apostolic See to your
predecessors, and you will find injunctions either from me or from my
predecessors on that in which we learn you have presumed.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p12"></span>For there has come to us our brother
Atticus, the metropolitan <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) bishop
of Old Epirus, with the bishops of his province, and with tearful
pleading has complained of the undeserved contumely he has suffered, in
the presence of your own deacons who, by giving no contradiction to
these woeful complaints, showed that what was impressed upon us did not
want for truth.  We read also in your letter, which those same deacons
of yours brought, that brother Atticus had come to Thessalonica, and
that he had also sealed his agreement in a written profession, so that
we could not but understand concerning him that it was of his own will
and free devotion that he had come, and that he had composed the
statement of his promise of obedience, although in the very mention of
this statement a sign of injury was betrayed.  For it was not necessary
that he should be bound in writing, who was already proving his
obedience by the very dutifulness of his voluntary coming.  Wherefore
these words in your letter bore witness to the bewailings of the
aforesaid, and through his outspoken account that which had been passed
over in silence is laid bare, namely that the Præfecture of Illyricum
had been approached, and the most exalted functionary among the
potentates of the world <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) had been
set in motion to expose an innocent prelate:  so that a company was sent
to carry out the aweful deed who were to enlist all the public servants
in giving effect to their orders, and from the church’s holy sanctuary
charged with no crime, or at best a false one, was dragged a priest, to
whom no truce was granted in consideration of his grievous ill-health or
the cruel winter weather:  but he was forced to take a journey full of
hardships and dangers through the pathless snows.  And this was a task
of such toil and peril that some of those who accompanied the bishop are
said to have succumbed <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) .

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p16"></span>I am quite dumb-founded, beloved
brother, yea and I am also sore grieved that you brought yourself to be
so savagely and violently moved against one about whom you had laid no
further information than that when summoned to appear he put off and
excused himself on the grounds of illness; especially when, even if he
deserved any such treatment, you should have waited till I had replied
to your consulting letter.  But, as I perceive, you thought too well of
my habits, and most truly foresaw how fair-minded <span
id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) an answer I was likely to make to
preserve harmony among priests:  and therefore you made haste to carry
out your movements without concealment, lest when you had received the
letter of our forbearance dictating another course, you should have no
licence to do that which is done.  Or perhaps some crime had reached
your ears, and metropolitan <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md)
bishop that you are, the weight of some new charge pressed you hard? 
But that this is not consistent with the fact, you yourself make certain
by laying nothing against him.  Yet even if he had committed some grave
and intolerable misdemeanour, you should have waited for our opinion: 
so as to arrive at no decision by yourself until you knew our pleasure. 
For we made you our deputy, beloved, on the understanding that you were
engaged to share our responsibility, not to take plenary powers on
yourself.  Wherefore as what you bestow a pious care on delights us
much, so your wrongful acts grieve us sorely.  And after experience in
many cases we must show greater foresight, and use more diligent
precaution:  to the end that through the spirit of love and peace all
matter of offence may be removed from the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xiv-p18.1"></span>Lord’s</span> churches, <span
id="page_18">p. 18</span> <span id="ii.iv.xiv-Page_18"></span>which we
have commended to you:  the pre-eminence of your bishopric being
retained in the provinces, but all your usurping excesses being shorn
off.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p19"></span>III.  *The rights of the metropolitans
under the vicariate of Anastasius are to be observed.*

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p20"></span>Therefore according to the canons of the
holy Fathers, which are framed by the spirit of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xiv-p20.1"></span>God</span> and hollowed by the whole world’s
reverence, we decree that the metropolitan bishops of each province over
which your care, brother, extends by our delegacy, shall keep untouched
the rights of their position which have been handed down to them from
olden times:  but on condition that they do not depart from the existing
regulations by any carelessness or arrogance.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p21"></span>IV.  *The negative qualifications of a
bishop determined.*

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p22"></span>In cities whose governors <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) have died let this form be observed in
filling up their place:  he, who is to be ordained, even though his good
life be not attested, shall be not a layman, not a neophyte, nor yet the
husband of a second wife, or one who, though he has or has had but one,
married a widow.  For the choosing of priests is of such surpassing
importance that things which in other members of the Church are not
blame-worthy, are yet held unlawful in them.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p24"></span>V.  *Continence is required even in
sub-deacons.*

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p25"></span>For although they who are not within the
ranks of the clergy are free to take pleasure in the companionship of
wedlock and the procreation of children, yet for the exhibiting of the
purity of complete continence, even sub-deacons are not allowed carnal
marriage:  that “both those that have, may be as though they had
not <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) ,” and those who have not,
may remain single.  But if in this order, which is the fourth from the
Head <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) , this is worthy to be
observed, how much more is it to be kept in the first, or second, or
third, lest any one be reckoned fit for either the deacon’s duties or
the presbyter’s honourable position, or the bishop’s pre-eminence, who
is discovered not yet to have bridled his uxorious desires.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p28"></span>VI.  *The election of a bishop must
proceed by the wishes of the clergy and people.*

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p29"></span>When therefore the choice of the chief
priest is taken in hand, let him be preferred before all whom the
unanimous consent of clergy and people demands, but if the votes chance
to be divided between two persons, the judgment of the metropolitan
should prefer him who is supported by the preponderance of votes and
merits:  only let no one be ordained against the express wishes of the
place:  lest a city should either despise or hate a bishop whom they did
not choose, and lamentably fall away from religion because they have not
been allowed to have whom they wished.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p30"></span>VII.  *Metropolitans are to refer to
their Vicar:  the mode of electing metropolitans is laid down.*

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p31"></span>However the metropolitan bishop should
refer to you, brother, about the person to be consecrated bishop, and
about the consent of the clergy and people:  and he should acquaint you
with the wishes of the province:  that the due celebration of the
ordination may be strengthened by your authority also.  But to right
selections it will be your duty to cause no delay or hindrance, lest the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xiv-p31.1"></span>Lord’s</span> flocks
should remain too long with their shepherd’s care.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p32"></span>Moreover when a metropolitan is defunct
and another has to be elected in to his place, the bishops of the
province must meet together in the metropolitical city:  that after the
wishes of all the clerics and all the citizens have been sifted, the
best man may be chosen from the presbyters of that same church or from
the deacons, and you are to be informed of his name by the priests of
the province, who will carry out the wishes of his supporters on
ascertaining that you agree with their choice <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) .  For whilst we desire proper
elections to be hampered by no delays, we yet allow nothing to be done
presumptuously without your knowledge.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p34"></span>VIII.  *Bishops are to hold provincial
councils twice a year.*

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p35"></span>Concerning councils of bishops we give
no other instructions than those laid down for the Church’s health by
the holy Fathers <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) :  to wit that
two meetings should be held a year, in which judgment should be passed
upon all the complaints which are wont to arise between the various
ranks of the Church.  But if perchance among the rulers themselves a
<span id="page_19">p. 19</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xiv-Page_19"></span>cause arise (which <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xiv-p36.1"></span>God</span> forbid) concerning one of the
greater sins, such as cannot be decided by a provincial trial, the
metropolitan shall take care to inform you, brother, concerning the
nature of the whole matter, and if, after both parties have come before
you, the thing be not set at rest even by your judgment, whatever it be,
let it be transferred to our jurisdiction.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p37"></span>IX.  *Translation from one see to
another is to be prohibited.*

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p38"></span>If any bishop, despising the
insignificance of his city, shall intrigue for the government of a more
populous place, and transfer himself by whatever means to a larger
flock, he shall first be driven from the chair he has usurped, and also
shall be deprived of his own:  so shall he preside neither over those
whom in his greed he coveted, nor over those whom in his arrogance he
spurned.  Therefore let each be content with his own bounds, and not
seek to be raised above the limits of his present post.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p39"></span>X.  *Bishops are not to entice or
receive the clergy of another diocese.*

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p40"></span>A cleric from another diocese let no
(bishop) accept or invite against the wishes of his own bishop:  but
only when giver and receiver agree together thereupon by friendly
compact.  For a man is guilty of a serious injury who ventures either to
entice or withhold from a brother’s church that which is of great use or
high value.  And so, if such a thing happen within the province, the
metropolitan shall force the deserting cleric to return to his church: 
but if he has withdrawn himself still further off, he shall be recalled
by your authoritative command:  so that no occasion be left for either
desire of gain or intrigue.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p41"></span>XI.  *When the Vicar shall require a
meeting of bishops, two from each province will be sufficient.*

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p42"></span>In summoning bishops to your presence,
we wish you to show great forbearance:  lest under a show of much
diligence you seem to exult in your brethren’s injuries.  Wherefore if
any greater case arise for which it is reasonable and necessary to
convene a meeting of brethren, it may suffice, brother, that two bishops
should attend from each province, whom the metropolitans shall think
proper to be sent, on the understanding that those who answer the
summons be not detained longer than fifteen days from the time fixed.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p43"></span>XII.  *In case of difference of opinion
between the Vicar and the bishops, the bishop of Rome must be
consulted.  The subordination of authorities in the Church expounded.*

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p44"></span>But if in that which you believed
necessary to be discussed and settled with the brethren, their opinion
differs from your own wishes, let all be referred to us, with the
minutes of your proceedings attested, that all ambiguities may be
removed, and what is pleasing to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xiv-p44.1"></span>God</span> decided.  For to this end we
direct all our desires and pains, that what conduces to our harmonious
unity and to the protection of discipline may be marred by no dissension
and neglected by no slothfulness.  Therefore, dearly beloved brother,
you and those our brethren who are offended at your extravagant conduct
(though the matter of complaint is not the same with all), we exhort and
warn not to disturb by any wrangling what has been rightfully ordained
and wisely settled.  Let none “seek what is his own, but what is
another’s,” as the Apostle says:  “Let each one of you please his
neighbour for his good unto edifying <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) .”  For the cementing of our unity
cannot be firm unless we be bound by the bond of love into an
inseparable solidity:  because “as in one body we have many members, but
all the members have not the same office; so we being many are one body
in Christ, and all of us members one of another <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) .”  The connexion of the whole body
makes all alike healthy, all alike beautiful:  and this connexion
requires the unanimity indeed of the whole body, but it especially
demands harmony among the priests.  And though they have a common
dignity, yet they have not uniform rank; inasmuch as even among the
blessed Apostles, notwithstanding the similarity of their honourable
estate, there was a certain distinction of power, and while the election
of them all was equal, yet it was given to one <span
id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) to take the lead of the rest.  From
which model has arisen a distinction between bishops also, and by an
important ordinance it has been provided <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) that every one should not claim
everything for himself:  but that there should be in each province one
whose opinion should have the priority among the brethren:  and again
that certain whose appointment is in the greater cities should undertake
a fuller responsibility, through whom the care of the universal Church
should converge towards Peter’s one seat, and nothing anywhere should be
separated from its Head.  Let not him then who knows he has been set
over certain others <span id="page_20">p. 20</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xiv-Page_20"></span>take it ill that some one has been set
over him, but let him himself render the obedience which he demands of
them:  and as he does not wish to bear a heavy load of baggage, so let
him not dare to place on another’s shoulders a weight that is
insupportable.  For we are disciples of the humble and gentle Master who
says:  “Learn of Me, for I am gentle and humble of heart, and ye shall
find rest for your souls.  For My yoke is easy and My burden light <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) .”  And how shall we experience this,
unless this too comes to our remembrance which the same <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xiv-p49.2"></span>Lord</span> says:  “He that
is greater among you, shall be your servant.  But he that exalteth
himself, shall be humbled:  and he that humbleth himself, shall be
exalted <span id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) .”

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p14"></span> The language is, I think, intentionally
exaggerated and high-flown:  *parturiunt montes nascetur ridiculus mus*.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p15"></span> Anastasius seems to have arraigned
Atticus before the civil court of the Prefect of Illyricum:  he sent his
apparitors, who violently dragged him out of the church, and brought him
in midwinter across country to be tried.

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p17"></span> The word is *civilia*, in which
Brissonius thinks he sees an allusion either to the opposition between
*civil* law and *prætor’s* law (to which Anastasius had appealed), or
else to the technical meaning of the word in jurisprudence as equivalent
to ‘Legitimate’ or ‘fair’.  The latter is more likely.

A reference to this passage will show that S. Paul does not limit
himself to the clergy in what he says:  for an interesting note on the

<span id="ii.iv.xiv-p33"></span> This method of electing the
metropolitan will at once strike the reader:  the electors apparently
are (1) the bishops of the province (who are not eligible for the
office); (2) the clergy of the diocese (who alone are eligible); and (3)
the laity of the diocese.  Only if one remembers how limited each
diocese was in extent, can one realise the working of the method.
