<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p2"></span>How they are to be admonished who
lament sins of deed, and those who lament only sins of thought.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p3"></span>(*Admonition* 30.)  Differently to be
admonished are those who deplore sins of deed, and those who deplore
sins of thought.  For those who deplore sins of deed are to be
admonished that perfected lamentations should wash out consummated
evils, lest they be bound by a greater debt of perpetrated deed than
they pay in tears of satisfaction for it.  For it is written, *He hath
given us drink in tears by measure* ([Ps. lxxix.
6](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p3.1"></span>):  which means that each person’s soul
should in its penitence drink the tears of compunction to such extent as
it remembers itself to have been dried up from <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p3.2"></span>God</span> through sins.  They are to be
admonished to bring back their past offences incessantly before their
eyes, and so to live that these may not have to be viewed by the strict
judge.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p4"></span>Hence David, when he prayed, saying,
*Turn away thine eyes from my sins* ([Psa.
51.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p4.1"></span> <span
id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287) .md), had said also a little before,
*My fault is ever before me* ([Psa.
51.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p5.1"></span>); as if to say, I beseech thee not to
regard my sin, since I myself cease not to regard it.  Whence also the
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p5.2"></span>Lord</span> says
through the prophet, *And I will not be mindful of thy sins, but be thou
mindful of them* ([Isa. 1:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000.md), [Isa.
43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025.md), [Isa.
26:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#000.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p5.3"></span>).  They are to be admonished to consider
singly all their past offences, and, in bewailing the defilements of
their former wandering one by one, to cleanse at the same time even
their whole selves with tears.  Whence it is well said through Jeremiah,
when the several transgressions of Judæa were being considered, *Mine
eye hath shed divisions of waters* ([Lam. iii.
48](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#048.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p5.4"></span>).  For indeed we shed divided waters
from our eyes, when to our several sins we give separate tears.  For the
mind does not sorrow at one and the same time alike for all things; but,
while it is more sharply touched by memory now of this fault and now of
that, being moved concerning all in each, it is purged at once from all.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p6"></span>They are to be admonished to build
upon the mercy which they crave, lest they perish through the force of
immoderate affliction.  For the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p6.1"></span>Lord</span> would not set sins to be
deplored before the eyes of offenders, were it His will to smite them
with strict severity Himself.  For it is evident that it has been His
will to hide from His own judgment those whom in anticipation He has
made judges of themselves.  For hence it is written, *Let us come
beforehand before the face of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p6.2"></span>Lord</span> in confession* ([Psa.
95.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p6.3"></span> <span
id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288) .md).  Hence through Paul it is said,
*If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged* ([1 Cor. xi.
31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p7.1"></span>).  And again, they are to be admonished
so to be confident in hope as not to grow torpid in careless security. 
For commonly the crafty foe, when he sees the soul which he trips up by
sin to be afflicted for its fall, seduces it by the blandishments of
baneful security.  Which thing is figuratively expressed in the history
of Dinah.  For it is written, *Dinah went* <span id="page_61b">p.
61b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-Page_61b"></span>*out to see the
women of that land; and when Sichem, the son of Hemor the Hivite, prince
of the country, saw her, he loved her, and seized her, and lay with her,
and defiled her by force; and his soul clave unto her, and he soothed
her with kind blandishments when she was sad* ([Gen. xxxiv.
1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p7.2"></span>).  For indeed Dinah goes out to see the
women of a foreign land, when any soul, neglecting its own concerns, and
giving heed to the actions of others, wanders forth out of its own
proper condition and order.  And Sichem, prince of the country,
overpowers it inasmuch as the devil corrupts it, when found occupied in
external cares.  *And his soul clave unto her*, because he regards it as
united to himself through iniquity.  And because, when the soul comes to
a sense of its sin, it stands condemned, and would fain deplore its
transgression, but the corrupter recalls before its eyes empty hopes and
grounds of security to the end that he may withdraw from it the benefit
of sorrow, therefore it is rightly added in the text, *And soothed her
with blandishments when she was sad.*  For he tells now of the heavier
offences of others, now of what has been perpetrated being nothing, now
of <span class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p7.3"></span>God</span>
being merciful; or again he promises time hereafter for repentance; so
that the soul, seduced by these deceptions, may be suspended from its
purpose of penitence, to the end that it may receive no good hereafter,
being saddened by no evil now, and that it may then be more fully
overwhelmed with punishment, in that now it even rejoices in its
transgressions.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p8"></span>But, on the other hand, those who
bewail sins of thought are to be admonished to consider anxiously within
the recesses of their soul whether they have sinned in delight only, or
also in consent.  For commonly the heart is tempted, and in the
sinfulness of the flesh experiences delight, and yet in its judgment
resists this same sinfulness; so that in the secrets of thought it is
both saddened by what pleases it and pleased by what saddens it.  But
sometimes the soul is so whelmed in a gulph of temptation as not to
resist at all, but follows of set purpose that whereby it is assailed
through delight; and, if outward opportunity be at hand, it soon
consummates in effect its inward wishes.  And certainly, if this is
regarded according to the just animadversion of a strict judge, the sin
is one, not of thought, but of deed; since, though the tardiness of
circumstances has deferred the sin outwardly, the will has accomplished
it inwardly by the act of consent.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p9"></span>Moreover, we have learnt in the case
of our first parent that we perpetrate the iniquity of every sin in
three ways; that is to say, in suggestion, delight, and consent.  Thus
the first is perpetrated through the enemy, the second through the
flesh, the third through the spirit.  For the lier-in-wait suggests
wrong things; the flesh submits itself to delight; and at last the
spirit, vanquished by delight, consents.  Whence also that serpent
suggested wrong things; then Eve, as though she had been the flesh,
submitted herself to delight; but Adam, as the spirit, overcome by the
suggestion and the delight, assented.  Thus by suggestion we have
knowledge of sin, by delight we are vanquished, by consent we are also
bound.  Those, therefore, who bewail iniquities of thought are to be
admonished to consider anxiously in what measure they have fallen into
sin, to the end that they may be lifted up by a measure of lamentation
corresponding to the degree of the downfall of which they are inwardly
conscious; lest, if meditated evils torment them too little, they lead
them on even to the perpetration of deeds.  But in all this they should
be alarmed in such wise that they still be by no means broken down.  For
often merciful <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p9.1"></span>God</span> absolves sins of the heart the
more speedily in that He allows them not to issue in deeds; and
meditated iniquity is the more speedily loosed from not being too
tightly bound by effected deed.  Whence it is rightly said by the
Psalmist, *I said I will declare against myself my iniquities to the
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p9.2"></span>Lord</span>, and
thou forgavest the impiety of my heart* ([Ps. xxxi.
5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxx-p9.3"></span>).  For in that he added impiety of
heart, he indicated that it was iniquities of thought that he would
declare:  and in saying, *I said I will declare*, and straightway
subjoining, *And thou forgavest*, he shewed how easy in such a case
pardon was.  For, while but promising that he would ask, he obtained
what he promised to ask for; so that, since his sin had not advanced to
deed, neither should his penitence go so far as to be torment; and that
meditated affliction should cleanse the soul which in truth no more than
meditated iniquity had defiled.
