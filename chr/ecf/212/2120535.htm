<p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p1.1"></A>Epistle V.</span></p>  
<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p2"></A>To Cyriacus, Bishop.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p3"></A>Gregory to Cyriacus, Bishop of Constantinople.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p4"></A>When in time past I represented the Apostolic See in the royal city, I became acquainted with the good qualities of your Holiness.&#160; And I greatly rejoice that the care of souls has been committed to you.&#160; And though unworthy, I beseech Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p4.1"></A>God</span> with all the prayers in my power that He would even increase His grace in you, and cause you to gather gain of souls for the eternal country.&#160; But, whereas you say that you are weak for this work that has been put upon you, we know that the first virtue is acknowledgment of infirmity; and from this we gather that you can fulfil well the ministry you have undertaken, that we see how, out of humility, you acknowledge your own infirmity.&#160; For we are all infirm; but he is more infirm who has not strength to consider his infirmity.&#160; But you, most blessed brethren, are for this reason strong, that, distrusting your own strength, you trust in the power of Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p4.2"></A>God</span>.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p5"></A>I cannot, however, express by the words of a letter how much my heart is bound to your Charity.&#160; But I pray that Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p5.1"></A>God</span> may by the gift of His grace multiply the same charity that is between us, and may take away all occasion of offence, lest the holy Church, united by the profession of the true faith, and compacted by conjunction of the hearts of the faithful, should suffer any damage from priests disputing with each other, which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p5.2"></A>God</span> forbid.&#160; I at any rate, in all that I speak, in all that I say, against the proud conduct of certain persons, still, through the bounty of Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p5.3"></A>God</span>, never relinquish custody of inward charity; but so execute outwardly what belongs to justice as by no means to disregard inwardly what belongs to love and kindness.&#160; And do you also ever return my love, and guard what belongs to peace and kindness; that, remaining of one mind, so as to allow no dissension to come in between us, we may be better able from the very unity of our hearts to obtain what we seek from the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p5.4"></A>Lord</span>.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p6"></A>Furthermore, I commend to your Holiness John, presbyter of Chalcedon, and Athanasius of Isauria, that no one may set you against them by underhand misrepresentations; for I have thoroughly examined their faith, and have found them sound in their confessions, which have also been given in writing.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.iii-p7"></A>Now may the Holy Trinity protect you with His hand, and render you always vigilant and careful in the custody of souls, to the end that in the eternal retribution you may be counted worthy to be crowned, not only for your own work, but also for the amelioration of your subjects.</p>
