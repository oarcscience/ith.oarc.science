<span id="ii.v.xxvii"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Sermon LIV.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.xxvii-p2.1"></span>On the Passion, III.; delivered on the
Sunday before Easter.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p3"></span>I.  *The two-fold nature of Christ set
forth.*

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p4"></span>Among all the works of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxvii-p4.1"></span>God’s</span> mercy,
dearly-beloved, which from the beginning have been bestowed upon men’s
salvation, none is more wondrous, and none more sublime, than that
Christ was crucified for the world.  For to this mystery all the
mysteries of the ages preceding led up, and every variation which the
will of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxvii-p4.2"></span>God</span>
ordained in sacrifices, in prophetic signs, and in the observances of
the Law, foretold that this was fixed, and promised its fulfilment:  so
that now types and figures are at an end, and we find our profit in
believing that accomplished which before we found our profit in looking
forward to.  In all things, therefore, dearly-beloved, which pertain to
the Passion of our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxvii-p4.3"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, the Catholic Faith
maintains and demands that we acknowledge the two Natures to have met in
our Redeemer, and while their properties remained, such a union of both
Natures to have been effected that, from the time when, as the cause of
mankind required, in the blessed Virgin’s womb, “the Word became flesh,”
we may not think of Him as <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxvii-p4.4"></span>God</span> without that which is man, nor as
man without that which is <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxvii-p4.5"></span>God</span>.  Each Nature does indeed express
its real existence by actions that distinguish it, but neither separates
itself from connexion with the other.  Nothing is wanting there on
either side; in the majesty the humility is complete, in the humility
the majesty is complete:  and the unity does not introduce confusion,
nor does the distinctiveness destroy the unity.  The one is passible,
the other inviolable; and yet the degradation belongs to the same
Person, as does the glory.  He is present at once in weakness and in
power; at once capable of death and the vanquisher of it.  Therefore,
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxvii-p4.6"></span>God</span> took on
Him whole Manhood, and so blended the two Natures together by means of
His mercy and power, that each Nature was present in the other, and
neither passed out of its own properties into the other.

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p5"></span>II.  *The two natures acted conjointly,
and the human sufferings were not compulsory, but in accordance with the
Divine will.*

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p6"></span>But because the design of that mystery
which was ordained for our restoration before the eternal ages, was not
to be carried out without human weakness and without Divine power <span
id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972.md) , both “form” does that which is
proper to it in common with the other, the Word, that is, performing
that which is the Word’s and the flesh that which is of the flesh.  One
of them gleams bright with miracles, the other succumbs to injuries. 
The one departs not from equality with the Father’s glory, the other
leaves not the nature of our race.  But nevertheless even His very
endurance of sufferings does not so far expose Him to a participation in
our humility as to separate Him from the power of the Godhead.  All the
mockery and insults, all the persecution and pain which the madness of
the wicked inflicted on the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxvii-p7.1"></span>Lord</span>, was not endured of necessity,
but undertaken of free-will:  “for the Son of Man came to seek and to
save that which had perished <span id="fr_973"></span>[974](#fn_973.md) :” 
and He used the wickedness of His persecutors for the redemption of all
men in such a way that in the mystery of His Death and Resurrection even
His murderers could have been saved, if they had believed.

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p9"></span>III.  *Judas’ infamy has never been
exceeded.*

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p10"></span>And hence, Judas, thou art proved more
criminal and unhappier than all; for when repentance should have called
thee back to the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxvii-p10.1"></span>Lord</span>, despair dragged thee to the
halter.  Thou shouldest have awaited the completion of thy crime, and
have put off thy ghastly death by hanging, until Christ’s Blood was shed
for all sinners.  And among the many miracles and gifts of the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxvii-p10.2"></span>Lord’s</span> which might
have aroused thy conscience, those holy mysteries, at least, might have
rescued thee from thy headlong fall, which at the Paschal supper thou
hadst received, being even then detected in thy treachery by the sign of
Divine knowledge.  Why dost thou <span id="page_166">p. 166</span> <span
id="ii.v.xxvii-Page_166"></span>distrust the goodness of Him, Who did
not repel thee from the communion of His body and blood, Who did not
deny thee the kiss of peace when thou camest with crowds and a band of
armed men to seize Him.  But O man that nothing could convert, O “spirit
going and not returning <span id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974.md) ,” thou
didst follow thy heart’s rage, and, the devil standing at thy right
hand, didst turn the wickedness, which thou hadst prepared against the
life of all the saints, to thine own destruction, so that, because thy
crime had exceeded all measure of punishment, thy wickedness might make
thee thine own judge, thy punishment allow thee to be thine own hangman.

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p12"></span>IV.  *Christ voluntarily bartered His
glory for our weakness.*

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p13"></span>When, therefore, “<span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxvii-p13.1"></span>God</span> was in Christ
reconciling the world to Himself <span id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975.md)
,” and the Creator Himself was wearing the creature which was to be
restored to the image of its Creator; and after the Divinely-miraculous
works had been performed, the performance of which the spirit of
prophecy had once predicted, “then shall the eyes of the blind be opened
and the ears of the deaf shall hear; then shall the lame man leap as a
hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be plain <span
id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976.md) ;” Jesus knowing that the time was now
come for the fulfilment of His glorious Passion, said, “My soul is
sorrowful even unto death <span id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977.md) ;” and
again, “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me <span
id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978.md) .”  And these words, expressing a
certain fear, show His desire to heal the affection of our weakness by
sharing them, and to check our fear of enduring pain by undergoing it. 
In our Nature, therefore, the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxvii-p17.2"></span>Lord</span> trembled with our fear, that He
might fully clothe our weakness and our frailty with the completeness of
His own strength.  For He had come into this world a rich and merciful
Merchant from the skies, and by a wondrous exchange had entered into a
bargain of salvation with us, receiving ours and giving His, honour for
insults, salvation for pain, life for death:  and He Whom more than
12,000 of the angel-hosts might have served <span
id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979.md) for the annihilation of His
persecutors, preferred to entertain our fears, rather than employ His
own power.

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p19"></span>V*.  S. Peter was the first to benefit
by his Master’s humiliation.*

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p20"></span>And how much this humiliation conferred
upon all the faithful, the most blessed Apostle Peter was the first to
prove, who, after the fierce blast of threatening cruelty had dismayed
him, quickly changed, and was restored to vigour, finding remedy from
the great Pattern, so that the suddenly-shaken member returned to the
firmness of the Head.  For the bond-servant could not be “greater than
the <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxvii-p20.1"></span>Lord</span>, nor
the disciple greater than the master <span
id="fr_980"></span>[981](#fn_980.md) ,” and he could not have vanquished
the trembling of human frailty had not the Vanquisher of Death first
feared.  The <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxvii-p21.2"></span>Lord</span>, therefore, “looked back upon
Peter <span id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981.md) ,” and amid the calumnies
of priests, the falsehoods of witnesses, the injuries of those that
scourged and spat upon Him, met His dismayed disciple with those eyes
wherewith He had foreseen his dismay:  and the gaze of the Truth entered
into him, on whose heart correction must be wrought, as if the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxvii-p22.2"></span>Lord’s</span> voice were
making itself heard there, and saying, Whither goest thou, Peter? why
retirest thou upon thyself? turn thou to Me, put thy trust in Me, follow
Me:  this is the time of My Passion, the hour of thy suffering is not
yet come.  Why dost thou fear what thou, too, shalt overcome?  Let not
the weakness, in which I share, confound thee.  I was fearful for thee;
do thou be confident of Me.

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p23"></span>VI.  *The mad counsel of the Jews was
turned to their own destruction.*

<span id="ii.v.xxvii-p24"></span>“And when morning was come all the
chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put
him to death <span id="fr_982"></span>[983](#fn_982.md) .”  This morning, O
ye Jews, was for you not the rising, but the setting of the sun, nor did
the wonted daylight visit your eyes, but a night of blackest darkness
brooded on your naughty hearts.  This morning overthrew for you the
temple and its altars, did away with the Law and the Prophets, destroyed
the Kingdom and the priesthood, turned all your feasts into eternal
mourning.  For ye resolved on a mad and bloody counsel, ye “fat bulls,”
ye “many oxen,” ye “roaring” wild beasts, ye rabid “dogs <span
id="fr_983"></span>[984](#fn_983.md) ,” to give up to death the Author of
life and the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxvii-p26.2"></span>Lord</span> of glory; and, as if the
enormity of your fury could be palliated by employing the verdict of
him, who ruled your province, you lead Jesus bound to Pilate’s judgment,
that the terror-stricken judge being overcome by your persistent shouts,
you might choose a man that was a murderer for pardon, and demand the
crucifixion of the Saviour of the world.  After this condemnation of
Christ, brought about more by the cowardice than the power of Pilate,
who with <span id="page_167">p. 167</span> <span
id="ii.v.xxvii-Page_167"></span>washed hands but polluted mouth sent
Jesus to the cross with the very lips that had pronounced Him innocent,
the licence of the people, obedient to the looks of the priests, heaped
many insults on the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxvii-p26.3"></span>Lord</span>, and the frenzied mob wreaked
its rage on Him, Who meekly and voluntarily endured it all.  But
because, dearly-beloved, the whole story is too long to go through
to-day, let us put off the rest till Wednesday, when the reading of the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxvii-p26.4"></span>Lord’s</span>
Passion will be repeated <span id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984.md) .  For
the <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.xxvii-p27.1"></span>Lord</span> will
grant to your prayers, that of His own free gift we may fulfil our
promise:  through our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.xxvii-p27.2"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, Who liveth and
reigneth for ever and ever.  Amen.
