<span id="iii.v.iv.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxix-p2"></span>To Queen Theodelinda.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxix-p3"></span>Gregory to Theodelinda, Queen of the
Lombards <span id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md) .

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxix-p5"></span>It has come to our knowledge from the
report of certain persons that your Glory has been led on by some
bishops even to the offence against holy Church of suspending yourself
from the communion of Catholic unanimity.  Now the more we sincerely
love you, the more seriously are we distressed about you, that you
believe unskilled and foolish men, who not only do not know what they
talk about, but can hardly understand what they have heard; who, while
they neither read themselves, nor believe those who do, remain in the
same error which they have themselves feigned to themselves concerning
us.  For we venerate the four holy synods; the Nicene, in which Arius,
the Constantinopolitan, in which Macedonius, the first Ephesine, in
which Nestorius, and the Chalcedonians, in which Eutyches and Dioscorus,
were condemned; declaring that whosoever thinks otherwise than these
four synods did is alien from the true faith.  We also condemn
whomsoever they condemn, and absolve whomsoever they absolve, smiting,
with interposition of anathema, any one who presumes to add to or take
away from the faith of the same four synods, and especially that of
Chalcedon, with respect to which doubt and occasion of superstition has
arisen in the minds of certain unskilled men.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxix-p6"></span>Seeing, then, that you know the
integrity of our faith from my plain utterance and profession, it is
right that you should have no further scruple of doubt with respect to
the Church of the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles:  but persist ye
in the true faith, and make your life firm on the rock of the Church;
that is on the confession of the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles,
lest all those tears of yours and all those good works should come to
nothing, if they are found alien from the true faith.  For as branches
dry up without the virtue of the root, so works, to whatsoever degree
they may seem good, are nothing, if they are disjoined from the solidity
of the faith.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxix-p7"></span>It therefore becomes your Glory to
send a communication with all speed to our most reverend brother and
fellow-bishop Constantius, of whose faith and life I have long been well
assured, and to signify by your letters addressed to him how kindly you
accept his ordination, and that you are in no wise separated from the
communion of his Church, so that we may truly rejoice with a common
exultation, as for a good and faithful daughter.  Know also that you and
your works will please <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxix-p7.1"></span>God</span>, if, before his assize comes,
they be approved by the judgment of his priests.
