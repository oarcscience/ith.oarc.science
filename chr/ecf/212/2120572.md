<span id="iii.v.viii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.xi-p2"></span>To Agnellus, Bishop of Terracina.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xi-p3"></span>Gregory to Agnellus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xi-p4"></span>It has come to our ears—a thing
shocking to be told—that some in your parts worship trees, and
perpetrate many other unlawful things contrary to the Christian faith. 
And we wonder why your Fraternity has delayed correcting this by strict
punishment.  On this account we exhort you by this present writing to
cause these persons to be sought out by diligent enquiry, and such
vengeance to be executed on them that both <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xi-p4.1"></span>God</span> may be pacified and their
punishment may be an example of rebuke to others.

<span id="iii.v.viii.xi-p5"></span>We have written also to Maurus the
Viscount that he should afford aid to your Fraternity in this matter,
that so you may be unable to find <span id="page_237b">p. 237b</span>
<span id="iii.v.viii.xi-Page_237b"></span>any excuse for not
apprehending them.  Further, as we find that many excuse themselves from
keeping watch over the walls, let your Fraternity be careful to suffer
no man, either under the name of our or your Church, or under any other
pretext, to be exempted from keeping watch:  but let all generally be
compelled, to the end that, while all keep watch, the custody of the
city may, by the help of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.xi-p5.1"></span>Lord</span>, be the better provided for.
