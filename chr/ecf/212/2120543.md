<span id="iii.v.vii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XIX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vii.xi-p2"></span>To Marinianus, Archbishop.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xi-p3"></span>Gregory to Marinianus, Archbishop of
Ravenna <span id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693.md) .

<span id="iii.v.vii.xi-p5"></span>Your Fraternity has been long aware
after what manner the Church of Ariminum has been hitherto deprived of
pastoral government by reason of the known bodily affliction of the
priest who was ordained by us <span id="fr_1694"></span>[1695](#fn_1694.md)
.  Now we, moved by the prayers of the inhabitants of that place, having
frequently exhorted him to return with the help of the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.xi-p6.1"></span>Lord</span> to his
Church, if he should feel himself relieved from this affliction of the
head whereby he was kept away, he has been expected now for four years
since the leave of absence given him.  And, when at the instance of
clergy and citizens who have come from thence and urged us with <span
id="page_218b">p. 218b</span> <span
id="iii.v.vii.xi-Page_218b"></span>entreaties, we urgently exhorted him
to return with them, the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xi-p6.2"></span>Lord</span> helping him, if able to do so,
he begged of us by a supplication in writing <span
id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695.md) , that, inasmuch as by reason of
this affliction wherewith he is held he can in no wise rise to the
government of the same Church, or to the office undertaken by him, we
should ordain a bishop to this same Church.  Hence, seeing that the
charge laid upon us of caring for all the Churches constrains us to see
that pastoral guardianship be no longer wanting to the flock of the
faithful, and being compelled by their entreaties, and by his
renunciation on the ground of his own inability, we have resolved that a
bishop should be ordained to this same Church of Ariminum:  and, having
issued our precept according to custom, we have not failed to admonish
the clergy and people of the same Church, to the end that they may
concur with concordant provision to choose for themselves a
prelate <span id="fr_1696"></span>[1697](#fn_1696.md) .  We therefore
exhort your Fraternity that him whom all with one consent shall choose
(as they themselves also have requested leave to do) you cause to be
summoned before you; and test him by cautious enquiry on all sides.  And
if, by favour of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xi-p8.1"></span>Lord</span>, none of the things that are
punished with death in the text of the Heptateuch are found in him, and
if, on the report of trustworthy persons, his life should approve itself
to you, send him to us with the certification of his election, adding
your own letter of testification, to the end that a prelate of this same
Church may, under the ordering of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xi-p8.2"></span>Lord</span>, be by us consecrated.
