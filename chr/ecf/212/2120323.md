id="iii.v.i.xxi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xxi-p2"></span>To Sebastian, Bishop of Rhisinum \[in
Dalmatia\].

<span id="iii.v.i.xxi-p3"></span>Gregory to Sebastian, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxi-p4"></span>Although I deserved to receive no
letters from your Blessedness, yet I also do not forget my own
forgetfulness; I blame my negligence, I stir up my sluggishness with
goads of love, that one who will not pay what he owes of his own accord,
may learn even under blows to render it.  Furthermore, I inform you that
I have prepared a full representation, with urgent prayers to our most
pious lords, to the effect that they ought to have sent the most blessed
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xxi-p4.1"></span>Lord</span>
patriarch Anastasius, with the use of the pallium granted him, to the
threshold of the blessed Peter, prince of the apostles, to celebrate
with me the solemnities of Mass; to the end that, though he were not
allowed to return to his See, he might at least live with me, retaining
his dignity.  But of the reason that has arisen for keeping back what I
had thus written the bearer of these presents will inform you. 
Nevertheless, ascertain the mind of the said lord Anastasius, and inform
me in your letters of whatever he may wish to be done in this
business <span id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326.md) .
