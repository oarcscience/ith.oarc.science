<span id="ii.iv.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xlii-p1.1"></span>Letter XLII.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xlii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xlii-p2.1"></span>To Ravennius, Bishop of Arles.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xlii-p3"></span>Leo the Pope to his well-beloved brother
Ravennius.

<span id="ii.iv.xlii-p4"></span> <span id="page_52">p. 52</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xlii-Page_52"></span>*He asks him to deal with the imposture
of a certain Petronianus.*

<span id="ii.iv.xlii-p5"></span>We wish you to be circumspect and
careful lest any blameworthy presumption should put forth undue claims: 
for, when it once finds an entrance by crafty stealth, it spreads itself
into greater rashness in the name of the dignity it has assumed.  We
have learnt, on the trustworthy evidence of your clergy, that a certain
wandering and vagabond Petronianus has boasted himself throughout the
provinces of Gaul as our deacon, and under cover of this office is going
about the various churches of that country.  We desire you, beloved
brother, so to check his abominable effrontery, as to disclose his
imposture, by warning the bishops of the whole district, and to expel
him from communion with all the Churches, lest he continue his claim. 
The <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xlii-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> keep
you safe, dearly beloved brother.  Dated 26th, August, in the consulship
of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).
