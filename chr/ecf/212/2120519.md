<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxiii-p2"></span>To Pelagius and Serenus, Bishops.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxiii-p3"></span>Gregory to Pelagius of Turni <span
id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666) and Serenus of Masilia
(*Marseilles*) Bishops of Gaul.  *A paribus* <span
id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667) .

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxiii-p6"></span>Although with priests who have the
charity that is well pleasing to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxiii-p6.1"></span>God</span> religious men need no
commendation, yet, since an apt time for writing has offered itself, we
have thought well to send a letter to your Fraternity, mentioning that
we have sent into your parts, with the help of the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.xxxiii-p6.2"></span>Lord</span>, for the
benefit of souls, the servant of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxiii-p6.3"></span>God</span> Augustine, of whose
earnestness we are assured, with other servants of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.xxxiii-p6.4"></span>God</span>.  Him your
Holiness must needs assist with priestly earnestness, and hasten to
afford him your succour.  We have also enjoined him, that so you may be
the more ready to support him, to make you fully acquainted with the
matter he has in hand, knowing that, when it is known to you, you will
lend yourselves with entire devotion for <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxxiii-p6.5"></span>God’s</span> sake to succour him as the
case requires.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxiii-p7"></span>Moreover, we commend in all ways to
your charity our common son the presbyter Candidus, whom we have sent
for the government of the patrimony of our Church.  Given on the tenth
day of the Kalends of August, Indiction 14.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxxiii-p4"></span> *De Turnis*; in Colbert.
*Turonis*.  The latter name itself would seem to denote *Tours*.  But it
is not easy to see why a common letter should have been addressed to the
Bishops of Tours and Marseilles.  And, further, would Tours on the Loire
be likely to lie on the route which the missionaries would take to
Britain?
