<span id="ii.iv.xxxii"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXII.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxii-p2.1"></span>To the Archimandrites of
Constantinople <span id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md) .</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxxii-p4"></span>To his well-beloved sons Faustus,
Martinus, and the rest of the archimandrites, Leo the bishop.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxii-p5"></span>He acknowledges their zeal and refers
them to the Tome.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxii-p6"></span>As on behalf of the faith which
Eutyches has tried to disturb, I was sending legates *de latere* <span
id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md) to assist the defence of the Truth, I
thought it fitting that I should address a letter to you also, beloved: 
whom I know for certain to be so zealous in the cause of religion that
you can by no means listen calmly to such blasphemous and profane
utterances:  for the Apostle’s command lingers in your hearts, in which
it is said, “If any man hath preached unto you any gospel other than
that which he received, let him be anathema <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md) .”  And we also decide that the
opinion of the said Eutyches is to be rejected, which, as we have learnt
from perusing the proceedings, has been deservedly condemned:  so that,
if its foolish maintainer will abide by his perverseness, he may have
fellowship with those whose error he has followed.  For one who says
that Christ had not a human, that is our, nature, is deservedly put out
of Christ’s Church.  But, if he be corrected through the pity of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxxii-p8.2"></span>God’s</span> Spirit and
acknowledge his wicked error, so as to condemn unreservedly what
catholics reject, we wish him not to be denied mercy, that the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxxii-p8.3"></span>Lord’s</span> Church may
suffer no loss:  for the repentant can always be readmitted, it is only
error that must be shut out.  Upon the mystery of great godliness <span
id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328.md) , whereby through the Incarnation of
the Word of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxii-p9.4"></span>God</span> comes our justification and
redemption, what is our opinion, drawn from the tradition of the
fathers, is now sufficiently explained according to my judgment in the
letter which I have sent to our brother Flavian the bishop <span
id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329.md) :  so that through the declaration of
your chief you may know what, according to the gospel of our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxxii-p10.1"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ,
we desire to be fixed in the hearts of all the faithful.  Dated 13th
June, in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes
(449).

<span id="ii.iv.xxxii-p7"></span> *De latere meo*.  This is interesting
as an early instance of the use of this expression for the legates of
the pope (now so familiar):  even though Quesnel is incorrect in saying
for certain that Leo is the first Bishop of Rome who employed them.  He
himself quotes Concil. Sardic., canon 7, where the fathers ask the Roman
bishop to send some one *e latere suo* (<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxii-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 347).
