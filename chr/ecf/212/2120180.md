<span id="ii.v.ii"></span>

<span id="ii.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Sermon II.</span>

<span id="ii.v.ii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.ii-p2.1"></span>On his Birthday, II.:  Delivered on the
Anniversary <span id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md) of his
Consecration.</span>

<span id="ii.v.ii-p4"></span>I.  *The <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii-p4.1"></span>Lord</span> raises up the weak and gives him
grace according to his need.*

<span id="ii.v.ii-p5"></span>The Divine condescension has made this an
honourable day for me, for it has shown by raising <span
id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md) my humbleness to the highest rank,
that He despised not any of His own.  And hence, although one must be
diffident of merit, yet it is one’s bounden duty to rejoice over the
gift, since He who is the Imposer of the burden <span
id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md) is Himself <span
id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) the Aider in its execution:  and lest
the weak recipient should fall beneath the greatness of the grace, He
who conferred the dignity will also give the power.  As the day
therefore returns in due course on which the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii-p8.1"></span>Lord</span> purposed that I should begin my
episcopal office, there is true cause for me to rejoice to the glory of
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.ii-p8.2"></span>God</span>, Who that I
might love Him much, has forgiven me much, and that I might make His
Grace wonderful, has conferred His gifts upon me in whom He found no
recommendations of merit.  And by this His work what does the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.ii-p8.3"></span>Lord</span> suggest and
commend to our hearts but that no one should presume upon his own
righteousness nor distrust <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii-p8.4"></span>God’s</span> mercy which shines out more
pre-eminently then, when the sinner is made holy and the downcast lifted
<span id="page_116">p. 116</span> <span
id="ii.v.ii-Page_116"></span>up.  For the measure of heavenly gifts does
not rest upon the quality of our deeds, nor in this world, in which “all
life is temptation <span id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) ,” is each
one rewarded according to his deserving, for if the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.ii-p9.2"></span>Lord</span> were to take count
of a man’s iniquities, no one could stand before His judgment.

<span id="ii.v.ii-p10"></span>II.  *The mighty assemblage of prelates
testifies to men’s loyal acceptance of Peter in Peter’s unworthy
successor.*

<span id="ii.v.ii-p11"></span>Therefore, dearly-beloved, “magnify the
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.ii-p11.1"></span>Lord</span> with me and
let us exalt His name together <span id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md)
,” that the whole reason of to-day’s concourse may be referred to the
praise of Him Who brought it to pass.  For so far as my own feelings are
concerned, I confess that I rejoice most over the devotion of you all;
and when I look upon this splendid assemblage of my venerable
brother-priests <span id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) I feel that,
where so many saints are gathered, the very angels are amongst us.  Nor
do I doubt that we are to-day visited by a more abundant outpouring of
the Divine Presence, when so many fair tabernacles of <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.ii-p13.1"></span>God</span>, so many excellent
members of the Body of Christ are in one place and shine with one
light.  Nor yet I feel sure, is the fostering condescension and true
love of the most blessed Apostle Peter absent from this congregation: 
he has not deserted your devotion, in whose honour you are met
together.  And so he too rejoices over your good feeling and welcomes
your respect for the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii-p13.2"></span>Lord’s</span> own institution as shown towards
the partners of His honour, commending the well ordered love of the
whole Church, which ever finds Peter in Peter’s See, and from affection
for so great a shepherd grows not lukewarm even over so inferior a
successor as myself.  In order therefore, dearly beloved, that this
loyalty which you unanimously display towards my humbleness may obtain
the fruit of its zeal, on bended knee entreat the merciful goodness of
our <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.ii-p13.3"></span>God</span> that in
our days He will drive out those who assail us, strengthen faith,
increase love, increase peace and deign to render me His poor slave,
whom to show the riches of His grace He has willed to stand at the helm
of the Church, sufficient for so great a work and useful in building you
up, and to this end to lengthen our time for service that the years He
may grant us may be used to His glory through Christ our <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.ii-p13.4"></span>Lord</span>.  Amen.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[115:654](2120180.htm#fr_653.md) <span
id="ii.v.ii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="ii.v.ii-p3"></span> This sermon, which in the older editions
used to be joined in one with the first, was separated by the Ballerinii
and assigned to the (1st?) anniversary of his pontifical consecration. 
Quesnel, who did not go so far as to separate the two parts, saw that
there were certain expressions in the first portion which did not suit
the common title given to the whole in *anniversario die assumptionis
eius*, proposed to alter it to *in octava consecrationis eius* (on the
octave, &c.).  I have adhered to the Ball.’s division, though I am not
entirely convinced by their arguments.

id="ii.v.ii-p12.2"></span>

<span id="ii.v.ii-p13"></span> The Ball. quote from several more or less
contemporary authorities to prove that this concourse is more likely to
have been on the anniversary than on the day of consecration itself and
they say that such a celebration of the octave as Quesnel suggests is
unknown to all antiquity.
