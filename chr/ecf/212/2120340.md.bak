<span id="iii.v.i.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LVI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxviii-p2"></span>To Peter, Subdeacon.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxviii-p3"></span>Gregory to Peter, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxviii-p4"></span>Being exceedingly desirous of
observing the festivals of saints, we have thought it needful to address
this our letter of direction to thy Experience, informing thee that we
have arranged for the dedication with all solemnity, with the help of
the <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xxxviii-p4.1"></span>Lord</span>,
in the month of August, of the Oratory of the Blessed Mary lately built
in the cell of brethren where the abbot Marinianus is known to preside,
to the end that what we have begun may through the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xxxviii-p4.2"></span>Lord’s</span>
operation be completed.  But, inasmuch as the poverty of that cell
requires that we should assist in that day of festival, we therefore
desire thee to give for celebrating the dedication, to be distributed to
the poor, ten *solidi* in gold, thirty *amphoræ* of wine, two hundred
lambs, two *orcæ* of oil, twelve wethers, and a hundred hens, which may
be afterwards charged in thy accounts.  Provide therefore for this being
done at once without any delay, that our desires, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxxviii-p4.3"></span>God</span> granting it, may take speedy
effect.
