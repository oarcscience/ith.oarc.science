<span id="iii.v.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.xiv-p2"></span>To John, Subdeacon.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xiv-p3"></span>Gregory to John, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xiv-p4"></span>Inasmuch as it is manifest that the
Apostolic See is, by the ordering of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xiv-p4.1"></span>God</span>, set over all Churches, there
is, among our manifold cares, especial demand for our attention, when
our decision is awaited with a view to the consecration of a bishop. 
Now on the death of Laurentius, bishop of the church of Mediolanum, the
clergy reported to us that they had unanimously agreed in the election
of our son Constantius, their deacon.  But, their report not having been
subscribed, it becomes necessary, that we may omit nothing in the way of
caution, for thee to proceed to Genua (*Genoa*), supported by the
authority of this order <span id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485) . 
And, inasmuch as there are many Milanese at <span id="page_130b">p.
130b</span> <span id="iii.v.iii.xiv-Page_130b"></span>present there
under stress of barbarian ferocity, thou must call them together, and
enquire into their wishes in common.  And, if no diversity of opinion
separates them from the unanimity of the election—that is to say, if
thou ascertainest that the desire and consent of all continues in favour
of our aforesaid son, Constantius,—then thou art to cause him to be
consecrated by his own bishops, as ancient usage requires, with the
assent of our authority, and the help of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xiv-p5.1"></span>Lord</span>; to the end that through the
observance of such custom both the Apostolic See may retain the power
belonging to it, and at the same time may not diminish the rights which
it has conceded to others.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xiv-p5"></span> The reason of John the subdeacon
being directed to go to Genoa rather than to Milan may have been danger
from the Lombards in approaching the latter place, as well as the fact
of many of the Milanese having, for the same reason, taken refuge in
Genoa.
