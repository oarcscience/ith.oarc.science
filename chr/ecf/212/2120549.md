<span id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p2"></span>To Theodore, Physician.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p3"></span>Gregory to Theodore, Physician at
Constantinople.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p4"></span>My most beloved son the deacon
Sabinianus <span id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708.md) , on his return to
me, brought me no letter from your Glory; but he conveyed hither what
had been sent for the poor and captives; whence I understood the
reason.  It was that you would not speak by letters to a man, having by
a good deed made your address to Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.1"></span>God</span>.  For this same deed of yours
has a voice of its own, which calls to the secret ears of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.2"></span>God</span>, as it is
written, *Hide thy alms in the bosom of the poor, and it shall entreat
for thee* ([Ecclesiasticus 29.15](../../../bib/apo/sir029.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.3"></span>).  And indeed to me, I confess, it is
sad to expend what is not my own, and to add to the accounts which I
keep of the substance of the Church those also of the property of my
most sweet son the lord Theodore.  And yet I rejoice with your benignity
that you carefully attend to and observe what the Truth says; *Give
alms, and behold, all things are clean unto you* ([Luke xi.
41](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#041.md)<span
id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.4"></span>); and this which is written, *Even as
water quencheth fire, so alms quench sin* ([Ecclesiasticus
3.33](../../../bib/apo/sir003.htm#033.md)<span
id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.5"></span>).  Paul the apostle also says, *Let
your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may be a
supply to your want* ([2 Cor. viii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.6"></span>).  Tobias admonishes his son, saying,
*If thou hast much, give abundantly; but if thou hast little, of that
little impart willingly* ([Tob. iv.
9](../../../bib/apo/tob004.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.7"></span>).  You therefore observe all these
precepts:  but we beg you to pray for us, lest we should dispense the
fruits of your labours indiscreetly, and not as need requires; lest from
that whereby you diminish sins we should heap up sins.  Now may Almighty
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.8"></span>God</span> keep
you under His protection, and so grant you human favour in an earthly
court as to bring you after a long life to the eternal joys of a
heavenly court.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xvii-p6"></span>We send you as the benediction of
Saint Peter, Prince of the apostles, whom you greatly love, a key from
his most sacred body, in which is enclosed iron from his chains, that
what bound his neck for martyrdom, may loose yours from all sins.
