<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle LIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p2"></span>To Virgilius, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p3"></span>Gregory to Virgilius, Bishop of
Arelate (*Arles*).

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p4"></span>O how good is charity, which through
an image in the mind exhibits what is absent as present to ourselves,
through love unites what is divided, settles what is confused,
associates things that are unequal, completes things that are
imperfect!  Rightly does the excellent preacher call it the bond of
perfectness; since, though the other virtues indeed produce perfectness,
yet still charity binds them together so that they can no longer be
loosened from the heart of one who loves.  Of this virtue, then, most
dear brother, I find thee to be full, as both those who came from the
Gallican parts and the words also of thy letter addressed to me testify
to me of thee.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p5"></span>Now as to thy having asked therein,
according to ancient custom, for the use of the pallium and the
vicariate of the Apostolic See, far be it from me to suspect that thou
hast sought eminence of transitory power, or the adornment of external
worship, in our vicariate and in the pallium.  But, since it is well
known to all whence the holy faith proceeded in the regions of Gaul,
when your Fraternity asks for a repetition of the old custom of the
Apostolic See, what is it but that a good offspring reverts to the bosom
of its mother? <span id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md)   With willing
mind therefore we grant what has been asked for, lest we should seem
either to withdraw from you anything of the honour due to you, or to
have despised the petition of our most excellent son king Childebert.
 But the present state of things requires the greater earnestness, that
with increase of dignity solicitude also may advance, and watchfulness
in the custody of others may grow, and the merits of your life may serve
as an example to your subjects, and that your Fraternity may never seek
your own through the dignity accorded you, but the gains of the heavenly
country.  For you know what the blessed apostle says, groaning, *For all
seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s* ([Philip. ii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p6.2"></span>).

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p7"></span>For I have learnt from information
given me by certain persons that in the parts of Gaul and Germany no one
attains to holy orders except for a consideration given.  If this is so,
I say it with tears, I declare it with groans, that, when the priestly
order has fallen inwardly, neither will it be able to stand outwardly
for long.  For we know from the Gospel what our Redeemer in person did;
how He went into the temple, and overthrew the seats of them that sold
doves ([Matth. xxi. 12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p7.1"></span>).  For to sell doves is to receive a
temporal consideration for the Holy Spirit, whom, being consubstantial
with Himself, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p7.2"></span>God</span> Almighty gives to men through
the imposition of hands.  From which evil what follows is already
intimated.  For of those who presumed to sell doves in the temple of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p7.3"></span>God</span> the
seats fell by <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p7.4"></span>God’s</span> judgment.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p8"></span>And in truth this transgression is
propagated with increase among subordinates.  For he who is promoted to
any sacred order for a price, being already corrupted in the very root
of his advancement, is the more ready to sell to others what he has
bought.  And where is that which is written, *Freely ye have received,
freely give* ([Matth. x. 8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p8.1"></span>)?

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p9"></span>And, seeing that the simoniacal heresy
was <span id="page_183b">p. 183b</span> <span
id="iii.v.v.xxvi-Page_183b"></span>the first to arise against the holy
Church, why is it not considered, why is it not seen, that whoso ordains
any one for money, causes him in advancing him, to become a heretic?

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p10"></span>Another very detestable thing has
also been reported to us; that some persons, being laymen, through
desire of temporal glory, are tonsured on the death of bishops, and all
at once are made priests.  In such cases it is already known what manner
of man he is who attains to priesthood, passing suddenly from a lay
estate to sacred leadership.  And one who has never served as a soldier
fears not to become a leader of the religious <span
id="fr_1617"></span>[1618](#fn_1617.md) .  How is that man to preach who
has perhaps never heard any one else preach?  Or how shall he correct
the ills of others who has never yet bewailed his own?  And, where Paul
the apostle prohibits a neophyte from coming to sacred orders, we are to
understand that, as one was then called a neophyte who had been newly
planted in the faith, so we now reckon among neophytes one who is still
new in holy conversation.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p12"></span>Moreover, we know that walls after
being built, are not made to carry a weight of timber till they are
dried of the moisture of their newness, lest, if a weight be put on them
before they are settled, it bear down the whole fabric together to the
ground.  And, when we cut trees for a building, we wait for the moisture
of their greenness to be first dried out, lest, if the weight of the
fabric is imposed on them while still fresh, they be bent from their
very newness, and be the sooner broken and fall down from having been
elevated prematurely.  Why, then, is not this scrupulously seen to among
men, which is so carefully considered even in the case of timber and
stones?

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p13"></span>On this account your Fraternity must
needs take care to admonish our most excellent son king Childebert that
he remove entirely the stain of this sin from his kingdom, to the end
that Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p13.1"></span>God</span> may give him the greater
recompense with Himself as He sees him both love what He loves and shun
what He hates.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p14"></span>And so we commit to your Fraternity,
according to ancient custom, under <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p14.1"></span>God</span>, our vicariate in the Churches
which are under the dominion of our most excellent son Childebert <span
id="fr_1618"></span>[1619](#fn_1618.md) , with the understanding that their
proper dignity, according to primitive usage, be preserved to the
several metropolitans.  We have also sent a pallium for thy Fraternity
to use within the Church for the solemnization of mass only.  Further,
if any one of the bishops should by any chance wish to travel to any
considerable distance, let it not be lawful for him to remove to other
places without the authority of thy Holiness.  If any question of faith,
or it may be relating to other matters, should have arisen among the
bishops, which cannot easily be settled, let it be ventilated and
decided in an assembly of twelve bishops.  But, if it cannot be decided
after the truth has been investigated, let it be referred to our
judgment.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p16"></span>Now may Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p16.1"></span>God</span> keep you
under His protection, and grant unto you to preserve by your behaviour
the dignity that you have received.  Given the 12th day of August,
Indiction 13.

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p6"></span> Gregory here asserts the view of his
day, which after his manner he takes for granted that Gaul had derived
its Christianity from Rome.  Similarly, long before him, pope Zosimus
(417–418), writing to the bishops of Gaul in support of the jurisdiction
over them of Patroclus of Arles, speaks of such jurisdiction being of
ancient right, derived from Trophimus having been sent from Rome as
first bishop of Arles, and all Gaul having received the stream of faith
from that fountain.  Gregory of Tours (*Hist. Franc*. i. 28), referring
to *Passio S. Saturnini Episc. Solos*., speaks of seven missionary
bishops having been sent from Rome to Gaul “Decio et Grato consulibus,”
i.e. <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span>
250, including Trophimus, who is said to have founded the see of Arles. 
But the see of Arles must have existed before the date assigned, since
it appears from Cyprian (Ep. VI. 7), that in 254 Marcian had long been
its bishop.  And generally, the well-known differences of the Gallican
liturgy and usages from the Roman, to which pope Gregory himself alludes
in his letter to Augustine (XI. 64), as well as Irenæus of Lyons, in the
second century, being said to have been a disciple of Polycarp points to
an Asiatic rather than Roman origin of the Church in Gaul.

<span id="fn_1617"></span>[183b:1618](2120480.htm#fr_1617.md) <span
id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p11"></span> *Religiosorum*.  The appellation is
applied to persons generally who gave themselves to a religious life,
including monks, nuns, dedicated virgins, and the like.  It must be here
taken to include the clergy.

<span id="fn_1618"></span>[183b:1619](2120480.htm#fr_1618.md) <span
id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p14.2"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p15"></span> Childebert II., the son of Sigebert
I. and Brunechild, was at this time the ruler of nearly all the
dominions of the Franks in Gaul.  Having been proclaimed by the
Austrasian nobles king of Austrasia on the death of his father, <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xxvi-p15.1"></span>a.d.</span> 575, he
acquired also Burgundy on the death of his uncle Guntramn in 593.  These
kingdoms at this time comprised by far the greatest part of Gaul, the
kingdom of what was called Neustria under Clotaire II. including only a
small territory on the north-west coast.
