<span id="ii.iv.xcvi-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xcvi-p1.1"></span>Letter CI.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xcvi-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xcvi-p2.1"></span>From Anatolius, Bishop of Constantinople, to
Leo.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xcvi-p3"></span>(Dealing with much the same subjects as
Letter XCVIII. from Anatolius’ own standpoint:  Chap. iii. is translated
*in extenso* as illustrating XCVIII., chap. iii.)

<span id="ii.iv.xcvi-p4"></span>III.  *He describes the circumstances
under which the doctrine of the Incarnation had been formulated by the
Synod.*

<span id="ii.iv.xcvi-p5"></span>But since after passing judgment upon
him we had to come to an agreement with prayers and tears upon a
definition of the right Faith; for that was the chief reason for the
Emperor’s summoning the holy Synod, at which your holiness was present
in the spirit with us, and wrought with us by the God-fearing men who
were sent from you; we, having the protection of the most holy and
beautiful martyr Euphemia, have all given ourselves to this important
matter with all deliberateness.  And as the occasion demanded that all
the assembled holy bishops should publish a unanimous decision for
clearness and for an explicit statement of the Faith in our Lord Jesus
Christ the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xcvi-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xcvi-p5.2"></span>God</span> who is found and revealed even to
those who seek Him not, yes, even to those who ask not for Him <span
id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md) , in spite of some attempts to resist
at first, nevertheless showed us His Truth, and ordained that it should
be written down and proclaimed by all unanimously and without
gainsaying, which thus confirmed the souls of the strong, and invited
into the way of Truth all who were swerving therefrom.  And, indeed,
after unanimously setting our names to this document, we who have
assembled in this ecumenical Synod in the name of the Faith of the same
most holy and triumphant martyr, Euphemia, and of our most religious and
Christ-loving Emperor Marcian, and our most religious and in all things
most faithful daughter the Empress Pulcheria Augusta, with prayer and
joy and happiness, having laid on the holy altar the definition written
in accordance with your holy epistle for the confirmation of our
Fathers’ Faith, presented it to their pious care; for thus they had
asked to receive it, and, having received it, they glorified with us
their Master Christ, who had driven away all the mist of heresy and had
graciously made clear the word of Truth.  And in this way was
simultaneously established the peace of the Church and the agreement of
the priests concerning the pure Faith by the Saviour’s mercy.
