<span id="iii.v.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Epistle VII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.vii-p2"></span>To Gennadius, Patrician.

<span id="iii.v.iv.vii-p3"></span>Gregory to Gennadius, Patrician and
Exarch of Africa.

<span id="iii.v.iv.vii-p4"></span>We are well assured that the mind of
your religious Excellency is inflamed with zeal of divine love against
those things especially which are done in unseemly wise in the
churches.  We therefore the more gladly impose on you the correction of
faults in ecclesiastical cases as we have confidence in the bent of your
pious disposition.  Be it known, then, to your Excellence that it has
been reported to us by some who have come to us <span id="page_147b">p.
147b</span> <span id="iii.v.iv.vii-Page_147b"></span>from the African
parts that many things are being committed in the council of Numidia
contrary to the way of the Fathers and the ordinances of the canons. 
And, being unable to bear any longer the frequent complaints that have
reached us about such things, we committed them to be enquired into to
our brother and fellow-bishop Columbus <span
id="fr_1528"></span>[1529](#fn_1528) , of whose gravity his very
reputation, which is spread abroad, now allows us not to doubt. 
Wherefore, greeting you with fatherly affection, we exhort your
Excellence that in all things pertaining to ecclesiastical discipline
you should lend him the support of your assistance, lest, if what is
done amiss should not be enquired into and visited, it should grow with
greater license into future excesses through precedent of long
continuance.  Know moreover, most excellent son, that if you seek
victories, and are dealing for the security of the province committed to
you, nothing will avail you more for this end than being zealous in
restraining as far as possible the lives of priests and the intestine
wars of Churches.
