id="iii.v.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Epistle VIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.vii-p2"></span>To Natalis, Archbishop.

<span id="iii.v.iii.vii-p3"></span>Gregory to Natalis, archbishop of
Salona <span id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476.md) .

<span id="iii.v.iii.vii-p5"></span>Whilst every kind of business
demands <span id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477.md) anxious investigation
of the truth, what pertains to deposition from sacerdotal rank should be
considered with especial strictness, since here the matter in hand is
not concerning persons constituted in a humble position, but, as it
were, concerning reversal of divine benediction.  This consideration has
also moved us to exhort your Fraternity with respect to the person of
Florentius, bishop of the city of Epidaurus.  For indeed we have been
told that he had been accused on certain criminal charges, and that,
without any canonical proof being sought, and without previous sentence
of any sacerdotal council, he has been deposed from his office of
dignity, not by law, but by authority.  Inasmuch, then, as no man can be
removed from the rank of episcopacy except for just causes by the
concordant sentence of priests, we exhort your Fraternity to cause the
aforesaid man to be recalled from the banishment into which he has been
driven, and his case enquired into in a consultation of bishops.  And,
should he be convicted by canonical proof of the charges brought against
him, without doubt he must be visited with canonical punishment.  But,
should the facts be found by the synodical inquisition to be otherwise
than had been supposed, it is necessary both that his accusers should
dread the rigour of justice, and that the incriminated person should
have the approbation of his innocence preserved inviolate.  But we have
committed by our order the execution of the above-mentioned business to
Antoninus, our subdeacon, to the end that decisions may be come to in
accordance with the laws and <span id="page_127b">p. 127b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iii.vii-Page_127b"></span>canons, and, with the help of the
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iii.vii-p6.1"></span>Lord</span>, be
carried into effect.
