<p class="c19"><a name="v.iii.xxviii-p2"></A>Grant, then, that all have erred; that the apostle was mistaken in giving his testimony; that the Holy Ghost had no such respect to any one (church) as to lead it into truth, although sent with this view by Christ,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2145"></A><A HREF="#fn_2145"><FONT SIZE="1">2146</FONT></A>

 grant, also, that He, the Steward of God, the Vicar of Christ,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2147"></A><A HREF="#fn_2147"><FONT SIZE="1">2148</FONT></A>
 neglected His office, permitting the churches for a time to understand differently, (and) to believe differently, what He Himself was preaching by the apostles,&#8212;is it likely that so many churches, and they so great, should have gone astray into one and the same faith?&#160; No casualty distributed among many men issues in one and the same result.

Can any one, then, be reckless&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2148"></A><A HREF="#fn_2148"><FONT SIZE="1">2149</FONT></A>
 enough to say that they were in error who handed on the tradition?</p>
