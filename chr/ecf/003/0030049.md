<span id="iv.iii.xliii-p2"></span>I will confess, however, without
hesitation, that there are some who in a sense may complain of
Christians that they are a sterile race:  as, for instance, pimps, and
panders, and bath-suppliers; assassins, and poisoners, and sorcerers;
soothsayers, too, diviners, and astrologers. But it is a noble fruit of
Christians, that they have no fruits for such as these.  And yet,
whatever loss your interests suffer from the religion we profess, the
protection you have from us makes amply up for it. What value do you set
on persons, I do not here urge who deliver you from demons, I do not
urge who for your sakes present prayers before the throne of the true
God, for perhaps you have no belief in that—but from whom you can have
nothing to fear?
