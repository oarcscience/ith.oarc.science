<span id="v.iv.iv.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Miracles Alone, Without
Prophecy, an Insufficient Evidence of Christ’s Mission.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.iii-p2"></span>A procedure <span
id="fr_3115"></span>[3116](#fn_3115) of this kind, you say, was not
necessary, because He was forthwith to prove Himself the Son and the
Sent One, and the Christ of God in very deed, by means of the evidence
of His wonderful works. <span id="fr_3116"></span>[3117](#fn_3116) On my
side, however, I have to deny that evidence simply of this sort was
sufficient as a testimony to Him. He Himself afterwards deprived it of
its authority, <span id="fr_3117"></span>[3118](#fn_3117) because when
He declared that many would come and “show great signs and
wonders,” <span id="fr_3118"></span>[3119](#fn_3118) so as to turn aside
the very elect, and yet for all that were not to be received, He showed
how rash was belief in signs and wonders, which were so very easy of
accomplishment by even false christs. Else how happens it, if He meant
Himself to be approved and understood, and received on a certain
evidence—I mean that of miracles—that He forbade the recognition of
those others who had the very same sort of proof to show, and whose
coming was to be quite as sudden and unannounced by any authority? <span
id="fr_3119"></span>[3120](#fn_3119) If, because He came before them,
and was beforehand with them in displaying the signs of His mighty
deeds, He therefore seized the first right to men’s faith,—just as the
firstcomers do the first place in the baths,—and so forestalled all who
came after Him in that right, take care that He, too, be not caught in
the condition of the later comers, if He be found to be behindhand with
the Creator, who had already been made known, and had already worked
miracles like Him, <span id="fr_3120"></span>[3121](#fn_3120) and like
Him had forewarned men not to believe in others, even such as should
come after Him. If, therefore, to have been the first to come and utter
this warning, is to bar and limit faith, <span
id="fr_3121"></span>[3122](#fn_3121) He will Himself have to be
condemned, because He was later in being acknowledged; and authority to
prescribe such a rule about later comers will belong to the Creator
alone, who could have been posterior to none. And now, when I am about
to prove that the Creator sometimes displayed by His servants of old,
and in other cases reserved for His Christ to display, the self-same
miracles which you claim as solely due to faith in your Christ, I may
fairly even from this maintain that there was so much the greater reason
wherefore Christ should not be believed in simply on account of His
miracles, inasmuch as these would have shown Him to belong to none other
(God) than the Creator, because answering to the mighty deeds of the
Creator, both as performed by His servants and reserved for <span
id="fr_3122"></span>[3123](#fn_3122) His Christ; although, even if some
other proofs should be found in your Christ—new ones, to wit—we should
more readily believe that they, too, belong to the same God as do the
old ones, rather than to him who <span id="page_323">p. 323</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.iii-Page_323"></span>has no other than new <span
id="fr_3123"></span>[3124](#fn_3123) proofs, such as are wanting in the
evidences of that antiquity which wins the assent of faith, <span
id="fr_3124"></span>[3125](#fn_3124) so that even on this ground he
ought to have come announced as much by prophecies of his own building
up faith in him, as by miracles, especially in opposition to the
Creator’s Christ who was to come fortified by signs and prophets of His
own, in order that he might shine forth as the rival of Christ by help
of evidence of different kinds.  But how was his Christ to be foretold
by a god who was himself never predicted? This, therefore, is the
unavoidable inference, that neither your god nor your Christ is an
object of faith, because God ought not to have been unknown, and Christ
ought to have been made known through God. <span
