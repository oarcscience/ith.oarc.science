<span id="v.iii.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL.—No Difference in the Spirit of
Idolatry and of Heresy. In the Rites of Idolatry, Satan Imitated and
Distorted the Divine Institutions of the Older Scriptures. The Christian
Scriptures Corrupted by Him in the Perversions of the Various
Heretics.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xl-p2"></span>The question will arise, By whom is to be
interpreted <span id="fr_2265"></span>[2266](#fn_2265.md) the sense of the
passages which make for heresies? By the devil, of course, to whom
pertain those wiles which pervert the truth, and who, by the mystic
rites of his idols, vies even with the essential portions <span
id="fr_2266"></span>[2267](#fn_2266.md) of the sacraments of God. <span
id="fr_2267"></span>[2268](#fn_2267.md) He, too, baptizes some—that is, his
own believers and faithful followers; <span
id="fr_2268"></span>[2269](#fn_2268.md) he promises the putting away <span
id="fr_2269"></span>[2270](#fn_2269) of sins by a laver (of his own.md);
and if my memory still serves me, Mithra there, (in the kingdom of
Satan,) sets his marks on the foreheads of his soldiers; celebrates also
the oblation of bread, and introduces an image of a resurrec<span
id="page_263">p. 263</span> <span id="v.iii.xl-Page_263"></span>tion,
and before a sword wreathes a crown. <span
id="fr_2270"></span>[2271](#fn_2270) What also must we say to (Satan’s.md)
limiting his chief priest <span id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271.md) to
a single marriage? He, too, has his virgins; he, too, has his
proficients in continence. <span id="fr_2272"></span>[2273](#fn_2272.md)
Suppose now we revolve in our minds the superstitions of Numa Pompilius,
and consider his priestly offices and badges and privileges, his
sacrificial services, too, and the instruments and vessels of the
sacrifices themselves, and the curious rites of his expiations and vows:
is it not clear to us that the devil imitated the well-known <span
id="fr_2273"></span>[2274](#fn_2273.md) moroseness of the Jewish law?
Since, therefore he has shown such emulation in his great aim of
expressing, in the concerns of his idolatry, those very things of which
consists the administration of Christ’s sacraments, it follows, of
course, that the same being, possessing still the same genius, both set
his heart upon, <span id="fr_2274"></span>[2275](#fn_2274.md) and succeeded
in, adapting <span id="fr_2275"></span>[2276](#fn_2275.md) to his profane
and rival creed the very documents of divine things and of the Christian
saints <span id="fr_2276"></span>[2277](#fn_2276.md) —his interpretation
from their interpretations, his words from their words, his parables
from their parables. For this reason, then, no one ought to doubt,
either that “spiritual wickednesses,” from which also heresies come,
have been introduced by the devil, or that there is any real difference
between heresies and idolatry, seeing that they appertain both to the
same author and the same work that idolatry does. They either pretend
that there is another god in opposition to the Creator, or, even if they
acknowledge that the Creator is the one only God, they treat of Him as a
different being from what He is in truth. The consequence is, that every
lie which they speak of God is in a certain sense a sort of idolatry.
