<span id="vi.vii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The Power of This Twofold
Patience, the Spiritual and the Bodily. Exemplified in the Saints of
Old.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.xiv-p2"></span>With this strength of patience, Esaias
is cut *asunder*, and ceases not to speak concerning the Lord; Stephen
is stoned, and prays for pardon to his foes. <span
id="fr_9168"></span>[9169](#fn_9168) Oh, happy also he who met all the
violence of the devil by the exertion of every species of
patience! <span id="fr_9169"></span>[9170](#fn_9169) —whom neither the
driving away of his cattle nor those riches of his in sheep, nor the
sweeping away of his children in one swoop of ruin, nor, finally, the
agony of his own body in (one universal) wound, estranged from the
patience and the faith which he had plighted to the Lord; whom the devil
smote with all his might in vain. For by all his pains he was not drawn
away from his reverence for God; but he has been set up as an example
and testimony to us, for the thorough accomplishment of patience as well
in spirit as in flesh, as well in mind as in body; in order that we
succumb neither to damages of our worldly goods, nor to losses of those
who are dearest, nor even to bodily afflictions.  What a bier <span
id="fr_9170"></span>[9171](#fn_9170) for the devil did God erect in the
person of that hero! What a banner did He rear over the enemy of His
glory, when, at every bitter message, that man uttered nothing out of
his mouth but thanks to God, while he denounced his wife, now quite
wearied with ills, and urging him to resort to crooked remedies! How did
God smile, <span id="fr_9171"></span>[9172](#fn_9171) how was the evil
one cut asunder, <span id="fr_9172"></span>[9173](#fn_9172) while Job
with mighty equanimity kept scraping off <span
id="fr_9173"></span>[9174](#fn_9173) the unclean overflow of his own
ulcer, while he sportively replaced the vermin that brake out thence, in
the same caves and feeding-places of his pitted flesh! And so, when all
the darts of temptations had blunted themselves against the corslet and
shield of his patience, that instrument <span
id="fr_9174"></span>[9175](#fn_9174) of God’s victory not only presently
recovered from God the soundness of his body, but possessed in redoubled
measure what he had lost. And if he had wished to have his children also
restored, he might again have been called father; but he preferred to
have them restored him “in that day.” <span
id="fr_9175"></span>[9176](#fn_9175) Such joy as *that*—secure so
entirely concerning the Lord—he deferred; meantime he endured a
voluntary bereavement, that he might not live without *some* (exercise
of) patience.

\[It is his inference rather.\]
