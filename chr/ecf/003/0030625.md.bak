<span id="v.viii.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIII.—No Disparagement of Our
Doctrine in St. Paul’s Phrase, Which Calls Our Residence in the Flesh
Absence from the Lord.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xliii-p2"></span>In the same way, when he says,
“Therefore we are always confident, and fully aware, that while we are
at home in the body we are absent from the Lord; for we walk by faith,
not be sight,” <span id="fr_7565"></span>[7566](#fn_7565.md) it is manifest
that in this statement there is no design of disparaging the flesh, as
if it separated us from the Lord.  For there is here pointedly addressed
to us an exhortation to disregard this present life, since we are absent
from the Lord as long as we are passing through it—walking by faith, not
by sight; in other words, in hope, not in reality. Accordingly he adds:
“We are indeed confident and deem it good rather to be absent from the
body, and present with the Lord;” <span
id="fr_7566"></span>[7567](#fn_7566.md) in order, that is, that we may walk
by sight rather than by faith, in realization rather than in hope.
Observe how he here also ascribes to the excellence of martyrdom a
contempt for the body. For no one, on becoming absent from the body, is
at once a dweller in the presence of the Lord, except by the prerogative
of martyrdom, <span id="fr_7567"></span>[7568](#fn_7567.md) he gains a
lodging in Paradise, not in the lower regions. Now, had the apostle been
at a loss for words to describe the departure from the body?  Or does he
purposely use a novel phraseology? For, wanting to express our temporary
absence <span id="page_577">p. 577</span> <span
id="v.viii.xliii-Page_577"></span>from the body, he says that we are
strangers, absent from it, because a man who goes abroad returns after a
while to his home. Then he says even to all: “We therefore earnestly
desire to be acceptable unto God, whether absent or present; for we must
all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ Jesus.” <span
id="fr_7568"></span>[7569](#fn_7568.md) If all of us, then all of us
wholly; if wholly, then our inward man and outward too—that is, our
bodies no less than our souls. “That every one,” as he goes on to say,
“may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath
done, whether it be good or bad.” <span
id="fr_7569"></span>[7570](#fn_7569.md) Now I ask, how do you read this
passage? Do you take it to be confusedly constructed, with a
transposition <span id="fr_7570"></span>[7571](#fn_7570.md) of ideas? Is
the question about what things will have to be received by the body, or
the things which have been already done in the body? Well, if the things
which are to be borne by the body are meant, then undoubtedly a
resurrection of the body is implied; and if the things which have been
already done in the body are referred to, (the same conclusion follows):
for of course the retribution will have to be paid by the body, since it
was by the body that the actions were performed. Thus the apostle’s
whole argument from the beginning is unravelled in this concluding
clause, wherein the resurrection of the flesh is set forth; and it ought
to be understood in a sense which is strictly in accordance with this
conclusion.
