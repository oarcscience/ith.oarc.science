id="iv.iii.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIX.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xlix-p2"></span>These are what are called presumptuous
speculations in our case alone; in the philosophers and poets they are
regarded as sublime speculations and illustrious discoveries. They are
men of wisdom, we are fools. They are worthy of all honour, we are folk
to have the finger pointed at; nay, besides that, we are even to have
punishments inflicted on us. But let things which are the defence of
virtue, if you will, have no foundation, and give them duly the name of
fancies, yet still they are necessary; let them be absurd if you will,
yet they are of use: they make all who believe them better men and
women, under the fear of never-ending punishment and the hope of
never-ending bliss.  It is not, then, wise to brand as false, nor to
regard as absurd, things the truth of which it is expedient to presume. 
On no ground is it right positively to condemn as bad what beyond all
doubt is profitable. Thus, in fact, you are guilty of the very
presumption of which you accuse us, in condemning what is useful. It is
equally out of the question to regard them as nonsensical; at any rate,
if they are false and foolish, they hurt nobody. For they are just (in
that case) like many other things on which you inflict no
penalties—foolish and fabulous things, I mean, which, as quite
innocuous, are never charged as crimes or punished. But in a thing of
the kind, if this be so indeed, we should be adjudged to ridicule, not
to swords, and flames, and crosses, and wild beasts, in which iniquitous
cruelty not only the blinded populace exults and insults over us, but in
which some of you too glory, not scrupling to gain the popular favour by
your injustice. As though all you can do to us did not depend upon our
pleasure.  It is assuredly a matter of my own inclination, being a
Christian. Your condemnation, then, will only reach me in that case, if
I wish to be condemned; but when all you can do to me, you can do only
at my will, all you can do is dependent on my will, and is not in your
power. The joy of the people in our trouble is therefore utterly
reasonless.  For it is our joy they appropriate to themselves, since we
would far rather be condemned than apostatize from God; on the contrary,
our haters should be sorry rather than rejoice, as we have obtained the
very thing of our own choice.
