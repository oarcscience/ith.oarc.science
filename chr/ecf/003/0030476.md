<span id="v.v.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Hermogenes Held to His Theory in
Order that Its Absurdity May Be Exposed on His Own Principles.</span>

<span id="v.v.vii-p2"></span>When he contends that matter is less than
God, and inferior to Him, and therefore diverse from Him, and for the
same reason not a fit subject of comparison with Him, who is a greater
and superior Being, I meet him with this prescription, that what is
eternal and unborn is incapable of any diminution and inferiority,
because it is simply this which makes even God to be as great as He is,
inferior and subject to none—nay, greater and higher than all.  For,
just as all things which are born, or which come to an end, and are
therefore not eternal, do, by reason of their exposure at once to an end
and a beginning, admit of qualities which are repugnant to God—I mean
diminution and inferiority, because they are born and made—so likewise
God, for this very reason, is unsusceptible of these accidents, because
He is absolutely unborn, <span id="fr_6193"></span>[6194](#fn_6193.md) and
also unmade. And yet such also is the condition of Matter. <span
id="fr_6194"></span>[6195](#fn_6194.md) Therefore, of the two Beings which
are eternal, as being unborn and unmade—God and Matter—by reason of the
identical mode of their common condition (both of them equally
possessing that which admits neither of diminution nor subjection—that
is, the attribute of eternity), we affirm that neither of them is less
or greater than the other, neither of them is inferior or superior to
the other; but that they both stand on a par in greatness, on a par in
sublimity, *and* on the same level of that complete and perfect felicity
of which eternity is reckoned to consist.  Now we must not resemble the
heathen in our opinions; for they, when constrained to acknowledge God,
insist on having other deities below Him. The Divinity, however, has no
degrees, because it is unique; and if it shall be found in Matter—as
being equally unborn and unmade and eternal—it must be resident in both
alike, <span id="fr_6195"></span>[6196](#fn_6195.md) because in no case can
it be inferior to itself. In what way, then, will Hermogenes have the
courage to draw distinctions; and thus to subject matter to God, an
eternal to the Eternal, an unborn to the Unborn, an author to the
Author? seeing that it dares to say, I also am the first; I too am
before all things; and I am that from which all things proceed; equal we
have been, together we have been—both alike without beginning, without
end; both alike without an Author, without a God. <span
id="fr_6196"></span>[6197](#fn_6196.md) What God, then, is He who subjects
me to a contemporaneous, co-eternal power? If it be He who is called
God, then I myself, too, have my own (divine) name. Either I am God, or
He is Matter, because we both are that which neither of us is. Do you
suppose, therefore, that he <span id="fr_6197"></span>[6198](#fn_6197.md)
has not made Matter equal with God, although, forsooth, he pretends it
to be inferior to Him?
