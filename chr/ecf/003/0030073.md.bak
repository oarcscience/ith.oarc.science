<span id="iv.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Concerning Festivals in Honour of
Emperors, Victories, and the Like.  Examples of the Three Children and
Daniel.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xv-p2"></span>But “let your works shine,” saith
He; <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) but now all our shops and
gates shine!  You will now-a-days find more doors of heathens without
lamps and laurel-wreaths than of Christians. What does the case seem to
be with regard to that species (of ceremony) also? If it is an idol’s
honour, without doubt an idol’s honour is idolatry. If it is for a man’s
sake, let us again consider that all idolatry is for man’s sake; <span
id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) let us again consider that all
idolatry is a worship done to men, since it is generally agreed even
among their worshippers that aforetime the gods themselves of the
nations were men; and so it makes no difference whether that
superstitious homage be rendered to men of a former age or of this.
Idolatry is condemned, not on account of the persons which are set up
for worship, but on account of those its observances, which pertain to
demons. “The things which are Cæsar’s are to be rendered to
Cæsar.” <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) It is enough that He set
in apposition thereto, “and to God the things which are God’s.” What
things, then, are Cæsar’s? Those, to wit, about which the consultation
was then held, whether the poll-tax should be furnished to Cæsar or no.
Therefore, too, the Lord demanded that the money should be shown Him,
and inquired about the image, whose it was; and when He had heard it was
Cæsar’s, said, “Render to Cæsar what are Cæsar’s, and what are God’s to
God;” that is, the image of Cæsar, which is on the coin, to Cæsar, and
the image of God, which is on man, <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) to God; so as to render to Cæsar
indeed money, to God yourself. Otherwise, what will be God’s, if all
things are Cæsar’s? “Then,” do you say, “the lamps before my doors, and
the laurels on my posts are an honour to God?” *They are there* of
course, not because they are an honour to God, but to him who is honour
in God’s stead by ceremonial observances of that kind, so far as is
manifest, saving the religious performance, which is in secret
appertaining to demons. For we ought to be sure if there are any whose
notice it escapes through ignorance of this world’s literature, that
there are among the Romans even gods of entrances; Cardea
(Hinge-goddess), called after hinges, and Forculus (Door-god) after
doors, and Limentinus (Threshold-god) after the threshold, and Janus
himself (Gate-god) after the gate: and of course we know that, though
names be empty and feigned, yet, when they are drawn down into
superstition, demons and every unclean spirit seize them for themselves,
through the bond of consecration. Otherwise demons have no name
individually, but they there find a name where they find also a token.
Among the Greeks likewise we read of Apollo Thyræus, *i.e.* of the door,
and the Antelii, or Anthelii, demons, as presiders over entrances. These
things, therefore, the Holy Spirit foreseeing from the beginning,
fore-chanted, through the most ancient prophet Enoch, that even
entrances would come <span id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span
id="iv.iv.xv-Page_71"></span>into superstitious use. For we see too that
other entrances <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) are adored in
the baths. But if there are beings which are adored in *entrances*, it
is to them that both the lamps and the laurels will pertain. To an idol
you will have done whatever you shall have done to an *entrance*. In
this place I call a witness on the authority also of God; because it is
not safe to suppress whatever may have been shown to *one*, of course
for the sake of *all*. I know that a brother was severely chastised, the
same night, through a vision, because on the sudden announcement of
public rejoicings his servants had wreathed his gates.  And yet himself
had not wreathed, or commanded them to be wreathed; for he had gone
forth *from home* before, and on his return had reprehended the deed. 
So strictly are we appraised with God in matters of this kind, even with
regard to the discipline of our family. <span
id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) Therefore, as to what relates to the
honours due to kings or emperors, we have a prescript sufficient, that
it behoves us to be in all obedience, according to the apostle’s
precept, <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) “subject to
magistrates, and princes, and powers;” <span
id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) but within the limits of discipline,
so long as we keep ourselves separate from idolatry. For it is for this
reason, too, that that example of the three brethren has forerun us,
who, in other respects obedient toward king Nebuchodonosor rejected with
all constancy the honour to his image, <span
id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md) proving that whatever is extolled
beyond the measure of human honour, unto the resemblance of divine
sublimity, is idolatry.  So too, Daniel, in all other points submissive
to Darius, remained in his duty so long as it was free from danger to
his religion; <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) for, to avoid
undergoing *that* danger, *he* feared the royal lions no more than
*they* the royal fires. Let, therefore, them who have no light, light
their lamps daily; let them over whom the fires of hell are imminent,
affix to their posts, laurels doomed presently to burn:  to them the
testimonies of darkness and the omens of their penalties are suitable.
*You* are a light of the world, <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md)
and a tree ever green. <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) If you
have renounced temples, make not your own gate a temple. I have said too
little. If you have renounced stews, clothe not your own house with the
appearance of a new brothel.
