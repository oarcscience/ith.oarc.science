<span id="v.iii.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIV.—Heresy Lowers Respect for
Christ, and Destroys All Fear of His Great Judgment. The Tendency of
Heretical Teaching on This Solemn Article of the Faith. The Present
Treatise an Introduction to Certain Other Anti-Heretical Works of Our
Author.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xliv-p2"></span>These evidences, then, of a stricter
discipline existing among us, are an additional proof of truth, from
which no man can safely turn aside, who bears in mind that future
judgment, when “we must all stand before the judgment-seat of
Christ,” <span id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298) to render an account
of our faith itself before all things. What, then, will they say who
shall have defiled it, even the virgin which Christ committed to them
with the adultery of heretics? I suppose they will allege that no
injunction was ever addressed to them by Him or by His apostles
concerning depraved <span id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299) and
perverse doctrines assailing them, <span
id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300) or about their avoiding and
abhorring the same.  (He and His apostles, perhaps,) will
acknowledge <span id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301) that the blame
rather lies with themselves and their disciples, in not having given us
previous warning and instruction!  They <span
id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302) will, besides, add a good deal
respecting the high authority of each doctor of heresy,—how that these
mightily strengthened belief in their own doctrine; how that they raised
the dead, <span id="page_265">p. 265</span> <span
id="v.iii.xliv-Page_265"></span>restored the sick, foretold the future,
that so they might deservedly be regarded as apostles. As if this
caution were not also in the written record: that many should come who
were to work even the greatest miracles, in defence of the deceit of
their corrupt preaching. So, forsooth, they will deserve to be forgiven!
If, however, any, being mindful of the writings and the denunciations of
the Lord and the apostles, shall have stood firm in the integrity of the
faith, I suppose *they* will run great risk of missing pardon, when the
Lord answers: I plainly forewarned you that there should be teachers of
false doctrine in my name, as well as that of the prophets and apostles
also; and to my own disciples did I give a charge, that they should
preach the same things to you. But as for you, it was not, of course, to
be supposed <span id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303) that you would
believe me! I once gave the gospel and the doctrine of the said rule (of
life and faith) to my apostles; but afterwards it was my pleasure to
make considerable changes in it! I had promised a resurrection, even of
the flesh; but, on second thoughts, it struck me <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304) that I might not be able to keep my
promise!  I had shown myself to have been born of a virgin; but this
seemed to me afterwards to be a discreditable thing. <span
id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305) I had said that He was my Father,
who is the Maker of the sun and the showers; but another and better
father has adopted me! I had forbidden you to lend an ear to heretics;
but in this I erred! Such (blasphemies), it is possible, <span
id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306) do enter the minds of those who go
out of the right path, <span id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307) and
who do not defend <span id="fr_2308"></span>[2309](#fn_2308) the true
faith from the danger which besets it.  On the present occasion, indeed,
our treatise has rather taken up a general position against heresies,
(showing that they must) all be refuted on definite, equitable, and
necessary rules, without <span id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309) any
comparison with the Scriptures. For the rest, if God in His grace
permit, we shall prepare answers to certain of these heresies in
separate treatises. <span id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310) To those
who may devote their leisure in reading through these (pages), in the
belief of the truth, be peace, and the grace of our God Jesus Christ for
ever. <span id="fr_2311"></span>[2312](#fn_2311)

<span id="v.iii.xliv-p6"></span> It seems to us, that this is the force
of the strong irony, indicated by the “credo,” which pervades this
otherwise unintelligible passage.  Dodgson’s version seems untenable: 
“Let them (the heretics) acknowledge that the fault is with themselves
rather than with those who prepared us so long beforehand.”

<span id="v.iii.xliv-p8"></span> This must be the force of a sentence
which is steeped in irony:  “Scilicet cum vos non crederetis.” We are
indebted to Oehler for restoring the sentence thus.
