<span id="v.iv.ii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—St. Paul Preached No New God,
When He Announced the Repeal of Some of God’s Ancient Ordinances. Never
Any Hesitation About Belief in the Creator, as the God Whom Christ
Revealed, Until Marcion’s Heresy.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xxi-p2"></span>Now if it was with the view of
preaching a new god that he was eager to abrogate the law of the old
God, how is it that he prescribes no rule about <span
id="fr_2563"></span>[2564](#fn_2563.md) the new god, but solely about the
old law, if it be not because faith in the Creator <span
id="fr_2564"></span>[2565](#fn_2564.md) was still to continue, and His law
alone was to come to an end? <span id="fr_2565"></span>[2566](#fn_2565.md)
—just as the Psalmist had declared: “Let us break their bands asunder,
and cast away their cords from us. Why do the heathen rage, and the
people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth stand up, and the
rulers take counsel together against the Lord, and against His
Anointed.” <span id="fr_2566"></span>[2567](#fn_2566.md) And, indeed, if
another god were preached by Paul, there could be no doubt about the
law, whether it were to be kept or not, because of course it would not
belong to the new lord, the enemy <span
id="fr_2567"></span>[2568](#fn_2567.md) of the law. The very newness and
difference of the god would take away not only all question about the
old and alien law, but even all mention of it.  But the whole question,
as it then stood, was this, that although the God of the law was the
same as was preached in Christ, yet there was a disparagement <span
id="fr_2568"></span>[2569](#fn_2568.md) of His law. Permanent still,
therefore, stood faith in the Creator and in His Christ; manner of life
and discipline alone fluctuated. <span
id="fr_2569"></span>[2570](#fn_2569.md) Some disputed about eating idol
sacrifices, others about the veiled dress of women, others again about
marriage and divorce, and some even about the hope of the resurrection;
but about God no one disputed. Now, if this question also had entered
into dispute, surely it would be found in the apostle, and that too as a
great and vital point. No doubt, after the time of the apostles, the
truth respecting the belief of God suffered corruption, but it is
equally certain that during the life of the apostles their teaching on
this great article did not suffer at all; so that no other teaching will
have the right of being received as apostolic than that which is at the
present day proclaimed in the churches of apostolic foundation. You
will, however, find no church of apostolic origin <span
id="fr_2570"></span>[2571](#fn_2570.md) but such as reposes its Christian
faith in the Creator. <span id="fr_2571"></span>[2572](#fn_2571.md) But if
the churches shall prove to have been corrupt from the beginning, where
shall the pure ones be found? Will it be amongst the adversaries of the
Creator? Show us, then, one of your churches, tracing its descent from
an apostle, and you will have gained the day. <span
id="fr_2572"></span>[2573](#fn_2572.md) Forasmuch then as it is on all
accounts evident that there was from Christ down to Marcion’s time no
other God in the rule of sacred truth <span
id="fr_2573"></span>[2574](#fn_2573.md) than the Creator, the proof of our
argument is sufficiently established, in which we have shown that the
god of our heretic first became known by his separation of the gospel
and the law.  Our previous position <span
id="fr_2574"></span>[2575](#fn_2574.md) is accordingly made good, that no
god is to be believed whom any man has devised out of his own conceits;
except indeed the man be a prophet, <span
id="fr_2575"></span>[2576](#fn_2575.md) and then his own conceits would not
be concerned in the matter. If Marcion, however, shall be able to lay
claim to this inspired character, it will be necessary for it to be
shown. There must be no doubt or paltering. <span
id="fr_2576"></span>[2577](#fn_2576.md) For all heresy is thrust out by
this wedge of the truth, that Christ is proved to be the revealer of no
God else but the Creator. <span id="fr_2577"></span>[2578](#fn_2577.md)
