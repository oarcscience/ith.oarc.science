<span id="v.v.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIV.—Curious Views Respecting God’s
Method of Working with Matter Exposed. Discrepancies in the Heretic’s
Opinion About God’s Local Relation to Matter.</span>

<span id="v.v.xliv-p2"></span>But it remains that I should show also how
you make God work. You are plainly enough at variance with the
philosophers; but neither are you in accord with the prophets. The
Stoics maintain that God pervaded Matter, just as honey the honeycomb.
You, however, affirm that it is not by pervading Matter that God makes
the world, but simply by appearing, and approaching it, just as beauty
affects <span id="fr_6588"></span>[6589](#fn_6588.md) a thing by simply
appearing, and a loadstone by approaching it. Now what similarity is
there in God forming the world, and beauty wounding a soul, or a magnet
attracting iron? For even if God appeared to Matter, He yet did not
wound it, as beauty does the soul; if, again, He approached it, He yet
did not cohere to it, as the magnet does to the iron. Suppose, however,
that your examples are suitable ones. Then, of course, <span
id="fr_6589"></span>[6590](#fn_6589.md) it was by appearing and approaching
to Matter that God made the world, and He made it when He appeared and
when He approached to it. Therefore, since He had not made it before
then, <span id="fr_6590"></span>[6591](#fn_6590.md) He had neither appeared
nor approached to it.  Now, by whom can it be believed that God had not
appeared to Matter—of the same nature as it even was owing to its
eternity? Or that He had been at a distance from it—even He whom we
believe to be existent everywhere, and everywhere apparent; whose
praises all things chant, even inanimate things and things incorporeal,
ac<span id="page_502">p. 502</span> <span
id="v.v.xliv-Page_502"></span>cording to (the prophet) Daniel? <span
id="fr_6591"></span>[6592](#fn_6591.md) How immense the place, where God
kept Himself so far aloof from Matter as to have neither appeared nor
approached to it before the creation of the world! I suppose He
journeyed to it from a long distance, as soon as He wished to appear and
approach to it.
