<span id="iv.vi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.iv-p2"></span>If, for these and other such rules, you
insist upon having positive Scripture injunction, you will find none.
Tradition will be held forth to you as the originator of them, custom as
their strengthener, and faith as their observer. That reason will
support tradition, and custom, and faith, you will either yourself
perceive, or learn from some one who has. Meanwhile you will believe
that there is some reason to which submission is due. I add still one
case more, as it will be proper to show you how it was among the
ancients also. Among the Jews, so usual is it for their women to have
the head veiled, that they may thereby be recognised. I ask in this
instance for the law. I put the apostle aside. If Rebecca at once drew
down her veil, when in the distance she saw her betrothed, this modesty
of a mere private individual could not have made a law, or it will have
made it only for those who have the reason which she had. Let virgins
alone be veiled, and this when they are coming to be married, and not
till they have recognised their destined husband. If Susanna also, who
was subjected to unveiling on her trial, <span
id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390.md) furnishes an argument for the veiling
of women, I can say here also, the veil was a voluntary thing. She had
come accused, ashamed of the disgrace she had brought on herself,
properly concealing her beauty, even because now she feared to please.
But I should not suppose that, when it was her aim to please, she took
walks with a veil on in her husband’s avenue. Grant, now, that she was
always veiled. In this particular case, too, or, in fact, in that of any
other, I demand the dress-law.  If I nowhere find a law, it follows that
tradition has given the fashion in question to custom, to find
subsequently (its authorization in) the apostle’s sanction, from the
true interpretation of reason. This instances, therefore, will make it
sufficiently plain that you can vindicate the keeping of even unwritten
tradition established by custom; the proper witness for tradition when
demonstrated by long-continued observance. <span
id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391.md) But even in civil matters custom is
accepted as law, when positive legal enactment is wanting; and it is the
same thing whether it depends on writing or on reason, since reason is,
in fact, the basis of law. But, (you say), if reason is the ground of
law, all will now henceforth have to be counted law, whoever brings it
forward, which shall have reason as its ground. <span
id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392.md) Or do you think that every believer is
entitled to originate and establish a law, if only it be such as is
agreeable to God, as is helpful to discipline, as promotes salvation,
when the Lord says, “But why do you not even of your own selves judge
what is right?” <span id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393.md) And not merely
in regard to a judicial sentence, but in regard to every decision in
matters we are called on to consider, the apostle also says, “If of
anything you are ignorant, God shall reveal it unto you;” <span
id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md) he himself, too, being accustomed to
afford counsel though he had not the command of the Lord, and to dictate
of himself <span id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395.md) as possessing the
Spirit of God who guides into all truth. Therefore his advice has, by
the warrant of divine reason, become equivalent to nothing less than a
divine command. Earnestly now inquire of this teacher, <span
id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396.md) keeping intact your regard for
tradition, from whomsoever it originally sprang; nor have regard to the
author, but to the authority, and especially that of custom itself,
which on this very account we should revere, that we may not want an
interpreter; so that if reason too is God’s gift, you may then learn,
not whether custom has to be followed by you, but why.
