<span id="v.vi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Another Account of the Strange
Aberrations of Sophia, and the Restraining Services of Horus.  Sophia
Was Not Herself, After All, Ejected from the Pleroma, But Only Her
Enthymesis.</span>

<span id="v.vi.x-p2"></span>But some dreamers have given another account
of the aberration <span id="fr_6722"></span>[6723](#fn_6722.md) and
recovery of <span id="page_509">p. 509</span> <span
id="v.vi.x-Page_509"></span>Sophia. After her vain endeavours, and the
disappointment of her hope, she was, I suppose, disfigured with paleness
and emaciation, and that neglect of her beauty which was natural to one
who <span id="fr_6723"></span>[6724](#fn_6723.md) was deploring the denial
of the Father,—an affliction which was no less painful than his loss.
Then, in the midst of all this sorrow, she by herself alone, without any
conjugal help, conceived and bare a female offspring. Does this excite
your surprise? Well, even the hen has the power of being able to bring
forth by her own energy. <span id="fr_6724"></span>[6725](#fn_6724.md) They
say, too, that among vultures there are only females, which become
parents alone.  At any rate, she was another without aid from a male,
and she began at last to be afraid that her end was even at hand. She
was all in doubt about the treatment <span
id="fr_6725"></span>[6726](#fn_6725.md) of her case, and took pains at
self-concealment. Remedies *could* nowhere *be found*. For where, then,
should we have tragedies and comedies, from which to borrow the process
of exposing what has been born without connubial modesty? While the
thing is in this evil plight, she raises her eyes, and turns them to the
Father. Having, however, striven in vain, as her strength was failing
her, she falls to praying. Her entire kindred also supplicates in her
behalf, and especially Nus. Why not? What was the cause of so vast an
evil? Yet not a single casualty <span
id="fr_6726"></span>[6727](#fn_6726.md) befell Sophia without its effect.
All her sorrows operate. Inasmuch as all that conflict of hers
contributes to the origin of Matter. *Her* ignorance, *her* fear, *her*
distress, become substances. Hereupon the Father by and by, being moved,
produces in his own image, with a view to these *circumstances* <span
id="fr_6727"></span>[6728](#fn_6727.md) the Horos whom we have mentioned
above; (and this he does) by means of Monogenes Nus, a male-female
(Æon), because there is this variation of statement about the
Father’s <span id="fr_6728"></span>[6729](#fn_6728.md) sex. They also go on
to tell us that Horos is likewise called Metagogius, that is, “a
conductor about,” as well as Horothetes (*Setter of Limits*). By his
assistance they declare that Sophia was checked in her illicit courses,
and purified from all evils, and henceforth strengthened (in virtue),
and restored to the conjugal state: (they add) that she indeed remained
within the bounds <span id="fr_6729"></span>[6730](#fn_6729.md) of the
Pleroma, but that her Enthymesis, with the accruing <span
id="fr_6730"></span>[6731](#fn_6730.md) Passion, was banished by Horos, and
crucified and cast out from the Pleroma,—even as they say, *Malum
foras*! (Evil, avaunt!) Still, that was a spiritual essence, as being
the natural impulse of an Æon, although without form or shape, inasmuch
as it had apprehended nothing, and therefore was pronounced to be an
infirm and feminine fruit. <span id="fr_6731"></span>[6732](#fn_6731.md)
