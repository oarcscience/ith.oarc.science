<span id="iv.viii.i.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV. <span
id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) —The Charge of Infanticide Retorted on
the Heathen.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xv-p3"></span>Since we are on a par in respect of
the gods, it follows that there is no difference between us on the point
of sacrifice, or even of worship, <span
id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) if I may be allowed to make good our
comparison from another sort of evidence. We begin our religious
service, or initiate our mysteries, with slaying an infant. As for you,
since your own transactions in human blood and infanticide have faded
from your memory, you shall be duly reminded of them in the proper
place; we now postpone most of the instances, that we may not seem to be
everywhere <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) handling the selfsame
topics. Meanwhile, as I have said, the comparison between us does not
fail in another point of view. For if we are infanticides in one sense,
you also can hardly be deemed such in any other sense; because, although
you are forbidden by the laws to slay new-born infants, it so happens
that no laws are evaded with more impunity or greater safety, with the
deliberate knowledge of the public, and the suffrages <span
id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) of this entire age. <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) Yet there is no great difference
between us, only you do not kill your infants in the way of a sacred
rite, nor (as a service) to God. But then you make away with them in a
more cruel manner, <span id="page_124">p. 124</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.xv-Page_124"></span>because you expose them to the cold
and hunger, and to wild beasts, or else you get rid of them by the
slower death of drowning. If, however, there does occur any
dissimilarity between us in this matter, <span
id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) you must not overlook the fact that it
is your own dear children <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) whose
life you quench; and this will supplement, nay, abundantly aggravate, on
your side of the question, whatever is defective in us on other grounds.
Well, but we are said to sup off our impious sacrifice! Whilst we
postpone to a more suitable place <span
id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) whatever resemblance even to this
practice is discoverable amongst yourselves, we are not far removed from
you in voracity.  If in the one case there is unchastity, and in ours
cruelty, we are still on the same footing (if I may so far admit our
guilt <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693) .md) in nature, where cruelty
is always found in concord with unchastity. But, after all, what do you
less than we; or rather, what do you not do in excess of us?  I wonder
whether it be a small matter to you <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) to pant for human entrails, because
you devour full-grown men alive? Is it, forsooth, only a trifle to lick
up human blood, when you draw out <span
id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) the blood which was destined to live?
Is it a light thing in your view to feed on an infant, when you consume
one wholly before it is come to the birth? <span
id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md)
