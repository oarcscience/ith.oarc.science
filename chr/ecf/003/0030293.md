<span id="v.iii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Granted that the Apostles
Transmitted the Whole Doctrine of Truth, May Not the Churches Have Been
Unfaithful in Handing It On? Inconceivable that This Can Have Been the
Case.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxvii-p2"></span>Since, therefore, it is incredible that
the apostles were either ignorant of the whole scope of the message
which they had to declare, <span id="fr_2138"></span>[2139](#fn_2138.md) or
failed to make known to all men the entire rule of faith, let us see
whether, while the apostles proclaimed it, perhaps, simply and fully,
the churches, through their own fault, set it forth otherwise than the
apostles had done. All these suggestions of distrust <span
id="fr_2139"></span>[2140](#fn_2139.md) you may find put forward by the
heretics.  They bear in mind how the churches were rebuked by the
apostle: “O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you?” <span
id="fr_2140"></span>[2141](#fn_2140.md) and, “Ye did run so well; who hath
hindered you?” <span id="fr_2141"></span>[2142](#fn_2141.md) and how the
epistle actually begins: “I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him,
who hath called you as His own in grace, to another gospel.” <span
id="fr_2142"></span>[2143](#fn_2142) That they likewise (remember.md), what
was written to the Corinthians, that they “were yet carnal,” who
“required to be fed with milk,” being as yet “unable to bear strong
meat;” <span id="fr_2143"></span>[2144](#fn_2143.md) who also “thought that
they knew somewhat, whereas they knew not yet anything, as they ought to
know.” <span id="fr_2144"></span>[2145](#fn_2144.md) When they raise the
objection that the churches were rebuked, let them suppose that they
were also corrected; let them also remember those (churches), concerning
whose faith and knowledge and conversation the apostle “rejoices and
gives thanks to God,” which nevertheless even at this day, unite with
those which were rebuked in the privileges of one and the same
institution.
