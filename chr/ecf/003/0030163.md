<span id="iv.viii.ii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Philosophers Had Not
Succeeded in Discovering God. The Uncertainty and Confusion of Their
Speculations.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ii-p2"></span>But the authority of the physical
philosophers is maintained *among you* <span
id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797) as the special property <span
id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798) of wisdom. *You mean* of course, that
pure and simple wisdom of the philosophers which attests its own
weakness mainly by that variety of opinion which proceeds from an
ignorance of the truth. Now what wise man is so devoid of truth, as not
to know that God is the Father and Lord of wisdom itself and truth?
Besides, there is that divine oracle uttered by Solomon:  “The fear of
the Lord,” says he, “is the beginning of wisdom.” <span
id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799) But <span
id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800) fear has its origin in knowledge; for
how will a man fear that of which he knows nothing? Therefore he who
shall have the fear of God, even if he be ignorant of all things else,
if he has attained to the knowledge and truth of God, <span
id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801) will possess full and perfect wisdom. 
This, however, is what philosophy has not clearly realized. For
although, in their inquisitive disposition to search into all kinds of
learning, *the philosophers* may seem to have investigated the sacred
Scriptures themselves for their antiquity, and to have derived thence
some of their opinions; yet because they have interpolated *these
deductions* they prove that they have either despised them wholly or
have not fully believed them, for in other cases also the simplicity of
truth is shaken <span id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802) by the
over-scrupulousness of an irregular belief, <span
id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803) and that they therefore changed them,
as their desire of glory grew, into products of their own mind. The
consequence of this is, that even that which they had discovered
degenerated into uncertainty, and there arose from one or two drops of
truth a perfect flood of argumentation. For after they had simply <span
id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804) found God, they did not expound Him as
they found Him, but rather disputed about His quality, and His nature,
and even about His abode. The Platonists, indeed, (held) Him to care
about worldly things, both as the disposer and judge thereof. The
Epicureans *regarded* Him as apathetic <span
id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805) and inert, and (so to say) a
non-entity. <span id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806) The Stoics believed
Him to be outside of the world; the Platonists, within the world.  The
God whom they had so imperfectly admitted, they could neither know nor
fear; and therefore they could not be wise, since they wandered away
indeed from the beginning of wisdom,” that is, “the fear of God.” Proofs
are not wanting that among the philosophers there was not only an
ignorance, but actual doubt, about the divinity. Diogenes, when asked
what was taking place in heaven, answered by saying, “I have never been
up there.” Again, whether there were any gods, he replied, “I do not
know; only there ought to be gods.” <span
id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807) When Crœsus inquired of Thales of
Miletus what he thought of the gods, the latter having taken some
time <span id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808) to consider, answered by
the word “Nothing.”  Even Socrates denied with an air of certainty <span
id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809) those gods of yours. <span
id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810) Yet he with a like certainty requested
that a cock should be sacrificed to Æsculapius.  And therefore when
philosophy, in its practice of defining about God, is detected in such
uncertainty and inconsistency, <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.ii-Page_131"></span>what “fear” could it possibly have
had of Him whom it was not competent <span
id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811) clearly to determine? We have been
taught to believe of the world that it is god. <span
id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812) For such the physical class of
theologizers conclude it to be, since they have handed down such views
about the gods that Dionysius the Stoic divides them into three kinds.
The first, he supposes, includes those gods which are most obvious, as
the Sun, Moon, *and* Stars; the next, those which are not apparent, as
Neptune; the remaining one, those which are said to have passed from the
human state to the divine, as Hercules *and* Amphiaraus. In like manner,
Arcesilaus makes a threefold form of the divinity—the Olympian, the
Astral, the Titanian—sprung from Cœlus and Terra; from which through
Saturn and Ops came Neptune, Jupiter, and Orcus, and their entire
progeny. Xenocrates, of the Academy, makes a twofold division—the
Olympian and the Titanian, which descend from Cœlus and Terra. Most of
the Egyptians believe that there are four gods—the Sun and the Moon, the
Heaven and the Earth. Along with all the supernal fire Democritus
conjectures that the gods arose. Zeno, too, will have it that their
nature resembles it. Whence Varro also makes fire to be the soul of the
world, that in the world fire governs all things, just as the soul does
in ourselves. But all this is most absurd. For he says, Whilst it is in
us, we have existence; but as soon as it has left us, we die. Therefore,
when fire quits the world in lightning, the world comes to its end.
