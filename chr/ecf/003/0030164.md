<span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Physical Philosophers
Maintained the Divinity of the Elements; The Absurdity of the Tenet
Exposed.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p2"></span>From these developments of opinion,
we see that your <span id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813) physical class
*of philosophers* are driven to the necessity of contending that the
elements are gods, since it alleges that other gods are sprung from
them; for it is only from gods that gods could be born. Now, although we
shall have to examine these other gods more fully in the proper place,
in the mythic section of the poets, yet, inasmuch as we must meanwhile
treat of them in their connection with the present class, <span
id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814) we shall probably even from their
present class, <span id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815) when once we turn
to the gods themselves, succeed in showing that they can by no means
appear to be gods who are said to be sprung from the elements; so that
we have at once a presumption <span id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816)
that the elements are not gods, since they which are born of the
elements are not gods. In like manner, whilst we show that the elements
are not gods, we shall, according to the law of natural
relationship, <span id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817) get a presumptive
argument that they cannot rightly be maintained to be gods whose parents
(in this case the elements) are not gods. It is a settled point <span
id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818) that a god is born of a god, and that
what lacks divinity <span id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819) is born of
what is not divine. Now, so far as <span
id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820) the world of which your philosophers
treat <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821) (for I apply this term to
the *universe* in the most comprehensive sense <span
id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822) ) contains the elements, ministering
to them as its component parts (for whatever its own condition may be,
the same of course will be that of its elements and constituent
portions), it must needs have been formed either by some being,
according to the enlightened view <span
id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823) of Plato, or else by none, according
to the harsh opinion <span id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824) of
Epicurus; and since it was formed, by having a beginning, it must also
have an end. That, therefore, which at one time before its beginning had
no existence, and will by and by after its end cease to have an
existence, cannot of course, by any possibility, seem to be a god,
wanting as it does that essential character of divinity, eternity, which
is reckoned to be <span id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825) without
beginning, and without end. If, however, it <span
id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826) is in no wise formed, and therefore
ought to be accounted divine—since, as divine, it is subject neither to
a beginning nor an end of itself—how is it that some assign generation
to the elements, which they hold to be gods, when the Stoics deny that
anything can be born of a god? Likewise, how is it that they wish those
beings, whom they suppose to be born of the elements, to be regarded as
gods, when they deny that a god can be born?  Now, what must hold good
of the universe <span id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827) will have to be
predicated of the elements, I mean of heaven, and of earth, and of the
stars, and of fire, which Varro has vainly proposed that you should
believe <span id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828) to be gods, and the
parents of gods, contrary to that generation and nativity which he had
declared to be impossible in a god. Now this same Varro had shown that
the earth and the <span id="page_132">p. 132</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.iii-Page_132"></span>stars were animated. <span
id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829) But if this be the case, they must
needs be also mortal, according to the condition <span
id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830) of animated nature; for although the
soul is evidently immortal, this attribute is limited to it alone: it is
not extended to that with which it is associated, that is, the body.
Nobody, however, will deny that the elements have body, since we both
touch them and are touched by them, and we see certain bodies fall down
from them. If, therefore, they are animated, laying aside the
principle <span id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831) of a soul, as befits
their condition as bodies, they are mortal—of course not immortal. And
yet whence is it that the elements appear to Varro to be animated? 
Because, forsooth, the elements have motion. And then, in order to
anticipate what may be objected on the other side, that many things else
have motion—as wheels, as carriages, as several other machines—he
volunteers the statement that he believes only such things to be
animated as move of themselves, without any apparent mover or impeller
from without, like the apparent mover of the wheel, or propeller of the
carriage, or director of the machine. If, then, they are not animated,
they have no motion of themselves. Now, when he thus alleges a power
which is not apparent, he points to what it was his duty to seek after,
even the creator and controller of the motion; for it does not at once
follow that, because we do not see a thing, we believe that it does not
exist. Rather, it is necessary the more profoundly to investigate what
one does not see, in order the better to understand the character of
that which is apparent. Besides if (you admit) only the existence of
those things which appear and are supposed to exist simply because they
appear, how is it that you also admit them to be gods which do not
appear? If, moreover, those things seem to have existence which have
none, why may they not have existence also which do not seem to have it?
Such, for instance, as the Mover <span id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832)
of the heavenly beings. Granted, then, that things are animated because
they move of themselves, and that they move of themselves when they are
not moved by another:  still it does not follow that they must
straightway be gods, because they are animated, nor even because they
move of themselves; else what is to prevent all animals whatever being
accounted gods, moving as they do of themselves? This, to be sure, is
allowed to the Egyptians, but their *superstitious* vanity has another
basis. <span id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833)
