<p class="c19"><a name="v.iv.v.xxxii-p2"></A>Who sought after the lost sheep and the lost piece of silver?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4766"></A><A HREF="#fn_4766"><FONT SIZE="1">4767</FONT></A>
 Was it not the loser? But who was the loser? Was it not he who once possessed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4767"></A><A HREF="#fn_4767"><FONT SIZE="1">4768</FONT></A>
 them? Who, then, was that? Was it not he to whom they belonged?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4768"></A><A HREF="#fn_4768"><FONT SIZE="1">4769</FONT></A>
 Since, then, <i>man</i> is the property of none other than the Creator, He possessed Him who owned him; He lost him who once possessed him; He sought him who lost him; He found him who sought him; He rejoiced who found him. Therefore the purport&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4769"></A><A HREF="#fn_4769"><FONT SIZE="1">4770</FONT></A>
 of neither parable has anything whatever to do with him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4770"></A><A HREF="#fn_4770"><FONT SIZE="1">4771</FONT></A>
 to whom belongs neither the sheep nor the piece of silver, that is to say, <i>man</i>.&#160; For he lost him not, because he possessed him not; and he sought him not, because he lost him not; and he found him not, because he sought him not; and he rejoiced not, because he found him not.&#160; Therefore, to rejoice over the sinner&#146;s repentance&#8212;that is, at the recovery of lost man&#8212;is the attribute of Him who long ago professed that He would rather that the sinner should repent and not die.</p>
