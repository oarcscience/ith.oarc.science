<span id="v.viii.i-p3"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="v.viii.i-p3.1"></span>The heretics against whom this work is
directed, were the same who maintained that the demiurge, or the god who
created this world and gave the Mosaic dispensation, was opposed to the
supreme God. Hence they attached an idea of inherent corruption and
worthlessness to all his works—amongst the rest, to the flesh or body of
man; affirming that it could not rise again, and that the soul alone was
capable of inheriting immortality. <span

the Body Brought to Light by the Gospel. The Faintest Glimpses of
Something Like It Occasionally Met with in Heathenism.  Inconsistencies
of Pagan Teaching.</span>

<span id="v.viii.i-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.viii.i-p8.1"></span>The</span> resurrection of the dead is the
Christian’s trust. <span id="fr_7284"></span>[7285](#fn_7284) By it we
are believers. To the belief of this (article of the faith) truth
compels us—that truth which God reveals, but the crowd derides, which
supposes that nothing will survive after death.  And yet they do
honour <span id="fr_7285"></span>[7286](#fn_7285) to their dead, and
*that* too in the most expensive way according to their bequest, and
with the daintiest banquets which the seasons can produce, <span
id="fr_7286"></span>[7287](#fn_7286) on the presumption that those whom
they declare to be incapable of all perception still retain an
appetite. <span id="fr_7287"></span>[7288](#fn_7287) But (let the crowd
deride): I on my side must deride it still more, especially when it
burns up its dead with harshest inhumanity, only to pamper them
immediately afterwards with gluttonous satiety, using the selfsame fires
to honour them and to insult them. What piety is that which mocks *its
victims* with cruelty? Is it sacrifice or insult (which the crowd
offers), when it burns its offerings to those it has already
burnt? <span id="fr_7288"></span>[7289](#fn_7288) But the wise, too,
join with the vulgar crowd in their opinion sometimes. There is nothing
after death, according to the school of Epicurus. After death all things
come to an end, even death itself, says Seneca to like effect.  It is
satisfactory, however, that the no less important philosophy of
Pythagoras and Empedocles, and the Plantonists, take the contrary view,
and declare the soul to be immortal; affirming, moreover, in a way which
most nearly approaches (to our own doctrine), <span
id="fr_7289"></span>[7290](#fn_7289) that the soul actually returns into
bodies, although not the same bodies, and not even those of human beings
invariably:  thus Euphorbus is supposed to have passed into Phythagoras,
and Homer into a peacock. They firmly pronounced the soul’s
renewal <span id="fr_7290"></span>[7291](#fn_7290) to be in a
body, <span id="fr_7291"></span>[7292](#fn_7291) (deeming it) more
tolerable to change the quality (of the corporeal state) than to deny it
wholly: they at least knocked at the door of truth, although they
entered not. Thus the world, with all its errors, does not ignore the
resurrection of the dead.
