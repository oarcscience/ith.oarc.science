<span id="vi.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Types of the Red Sea, and the
Water from the Rock.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix-p2"></span>How many, therefore, are the pleas <span
id="fr_8616"></span>[8617](#fn_8616.md) of nature, how many the privileges
of grace, how many the solemnities of discipline, the figures, the
preparations, the prayers, which have ordained the sanctity of water?
First, indeed, when the people, set unconditionally free, <span
id="fr_8617"></span>[8618](#fn_8617.md) escaped the violence of the
Egyptian king by crossing over *through water*, it was *water* that
extinguished <span id="fr_8618"></span>[8619](#fn_8618.md) the king
himself, with his entire forces. <span
id="fr_8619"></span>[8620](#fn_8619.md) What figure more manifestly
fulfilled in the sacrament of baptism? The nations are set free from the
world <span id="fr_8620"></span>[8621](#fn_8620.md) by means of *water*, to
wit: and the devil, their old tyrant, they leave quite behind,
overwhelmed in the *water*. Again, *water* is restored from its defect
of “bitterness” to its native grace of “sweetness” by the tree <span
id="fr_8621"></span>[8622](#fn_8621.md) of Moses. That tree was
Christ, <span id="fr_8622"></span>[8623](#fn_8622.md) restoring, to wit, of
Himself, the *veins* of sometime envenomed and bitter nature into the
all-salutary *waters* of baptism. This is the *water* which flowed
continuously down for the people from the “accompanying rock;” for if
Christ is “the Rock,” without doubt we see baptism blest by the *water*
in Christ. How mighty is the grace of *water*, in the sight of God and
His Christ, for the confirmation of baptism!  Never is Christ without
*water*: if, that is, He is Himself baptized in *water*; <span
id="fr_8623"></span>[8624](#fn_8623.md) inaugurates in *water* the first
rudimentary displays of His power, when invited to the nuptials; <span
id="fr_8624"></span>[8625](#fn_8624.md) invites the thirsty, when He makes
a discourse, to His own sempiternal *water*; <span
id="fr_8625"></span>[8626](#fn_8625.md) approves, when teaching concerning
love, <span id="fr_8626"></span>[8627](#fn_8626.md) among works of
charity, <span id="fr_8627"></span>[8628](#fn_8627.md) the cup of *water*
offered to a poor (child); <span id="fr_8628"></span>[8629](#fn_8628.md)
recruits His strength at a *well*; <span
id="fr_8629"></span>[8630](#fn_8629.md) walks over the *water*; <span
id="fr_8630"></span>[8631](#fn_8630.md) willingly crosses the *sea*; <span
id="fr_8631"></span>[8632](#fn_8631.md) ministers *water* to His
disciples. <span id="fr_8632"></span>[8633](#fn_8632.md) Onward even to the
passion does the witness of baptism last: while He is being surrendered
to the cross, *water* intervenes; witness Pilate’s hands: <span
id="fr_8633"></span>[8634](#fn_8633.md) when He is wounded, forth from His
side bursts *water*; witness the soldier’s lance! <span
id="fr_8634"></span>[8635](#fn_8634.md)
