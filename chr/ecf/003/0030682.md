<span id="v.x.i-p6"></span> ————————————

<span id="v.x.i-p7"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.x.i-p7.1"></span>Chapter I.</span>

<span id="v.x.i-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.x.i-p8.1"></span>The</span> earth brings forth, as if by
suppuration, great evil from the diminutive scorpion. The poisons are as
many as are the kinds of it, the disasters as many as are also the
species of it, the pains as many as are also the colours of it. Nicander
writes *on the subject of scorpions*, and depicts them. And yet to smite
with the tail—which tail will be whatever is prolonged from the hindmost
part of the body, and scourges—is the one movement which they all use
when making an assault. Wherefore that succession of knots in the
scorpion, which in the inside is a thin poisoned veinlet, rising up with
a bow-like bound, draws tight a barbed sting at the end, after the
manner of an engine for shooting missiles.  From which circumstance they
also call after the scorpion, the warlike implement which, by its being
drawn back, gives an impetus to the arrows. The point in their case is
also a duct of extreme minuteness, to inflict the wound; and where it
penetrates, it pours out poison. The usual time of danger is the summer
season: fierceness hoists the sail when the wind is from the south and
the south-west. Among cures, *certain* substances supplied by nature
have very great efficacy; magic also puts on some bandage; the art of
healing counteracts with lancet and cup. For some, making haste, take
also beforehand a protecting draught; but sexual intercourse drains it
off, and they are dry again. We have faith for a defence, if we are not
smitten with distrust itself also, in immediately making the sign <span
id="fr_8215"></span>[8216](#fn_8215.md) and adjuring, <span
id="fr_8216"></span>[8217](#fn_8216.md) and besmearing the heel with the
beast.  Finally, we often aid in this way even the heathen, seeing we
have been endowed by God with that power which the apostle first used
when he despised the viper’s bite. <span
id="fr_8217"></span>[8218](#fn_8217.md) What, then, does this pen of yours
offer, if faith is safe by what it has of its own?  That it may be safe
by what it has of its own also at other times, when it is subjected to
scorpions of its own.  These, too, have a troublesome littleness, and
are of different sorts, and are armed in one manner, and are stirred up
at a definite time, and that not another than one of burning heat.  This
among Christians is a *season of* persecution. When, therefore, faith is
greatly agitated, and the Church burning, as represented by the
bush, <span id="fr_8218"></span>[8219](#fn_8218.md) then the Gnostics break
out, then the Valentinians creep forth, then all the opponents of
martyrdom bubble up, being themselves also hot to strike, penetrate,
kill. For, because they know that many are artless and also
inexperienced, and weak moreover, that a very great number in truth are
Christians who veer about with the wind and conform to its moods, they
perceive that they are never to be approached more than when fear has
opened the entrances to the soul, especially when some *display of*
ferocity has already arrayed with a crown the faith of martyrs. 
Therefore, drawing along the tail hitherto, they first of all apply it
to the feelings, or whip with it as if on empty space. Innocent persons
undergo such suffering. So that you may suppose *the speaker* to be a
brother or a heathen of the better sort. <span id="page_634">p.
634</span> <span id="v.x.i-Page_634"></span>A sect troublesome to nobody
so dealt with! Then they pierce. Men are perishing without a reason. For
that they are perishing, and without a reason, is the first insertion.
Then they now strike mortally. But the unsophisticated souls <span
id="fr_8219"></span>[8220](#fn_8219.md) know not what is written, and what
meaning it bears, where and when and before whom we must confess, *or
ought*, save that this, to die for God, is, since He preserves me, not
even artlessness, but folly, nay madness. If He kills me, how will it be
His duty to preserve me? Once for all Christ died for us, once for all
He was slain that we might not be slain. If He demands the like from me
in return, does He also look for salvation from my death by violence? Or
does God importune for the blood of men, especially if He refuses that
of bulls and he-goats? <span id="fr_8220"></span>[8221](#fn_8220.md)
Assuredly He had rather have the repentance than the death of the
sinner. <span id="fr_8221"></span>[8222](#fn_8221.md) And how is He eager
for the death of those who are not sinners? Whom will not these, and
perhaps other subtle devices containing heretical poisons, pierce either
for doubt if not for destruction, or for irritation if not for death? As
for you, therefore, do you, if faith is on the alert, smite on the spot
the scorpion with a curse, so far as you can, with your sandal, and
leave it dying in its own stupefaction? But if it gluts the wound, it
drives the poison inwards, and makes it hasten into the bowels;
forthwith all the former senses become dull, the blood of the mind
freezes, the flesh of the spirit pines away, loathing for the Christian
name is accompanied by a sense of sourness. Already the understanding
also seeks for itself a place where it may throw up; and thus, once for
all, the weakness with which it has been smitten breathes out wounded
faith either in heresy or in heathenism. And now the present state of
matters is *such, that we are in* the midst of an intense heat, the very
dog-star of persecution,—a state originating doubtless with the
dog-headed one himself. <span id="fr_8222"></span>[8223](#fn_8222.md) Of
some Christians the fire, of others the sword, of others the beasts,
have made trial; others are hungering in prison for the martyrdoms of
which they have had a taste in the meantime by being subjected to clubs
and claws <span id="fr_8223"></span>[8224](#fn_8223.md) besides. We
ourselves, having been appointed for pursuit, are like hares being
hemmed in from a distance; and heretics go about according to their
wont.  Therefore the state of the times has prompted me to prepare by my
pen, in opposition to the little beasts which trouble our sect, our
antidote against poison, that I may thereby effect cures.  You who read
will at the same time drink. Nor is the draught bitter. If the
utterances of the Lord are sweeter than honey and the honeycombs, <span
id="fr_8224"></span>[8225](#fn_8224.md) the juices are from that source. If
the promise of God flows with milk and honey, <span
id="fr_8225"></span>[8226](#fn_8225.md) the ingredients which go to make
that draught have the smack of this. “But woe to them who turn sweet
into bitter, and light into darkness.” <span
id="fr_8226"></span>[8227](#fn_8226.md) For, in like manner, they also who
oppose martyrdoms, representing salvation to be destruction, transmute
sweet into bitter, as well as light into darkness; and thus, by
preferring this very wretched life to that most blessed one, they put
bitter for sweet, as well as darkness for light.
