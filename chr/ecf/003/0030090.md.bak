<span id="iv.v.vi-p2"></span>To the testimony of antiquity is added that
of later games instituted in their turn, and betraying their origin from
the titles which they bear even at the present day, in which it is
imprinted as on their very face, for what idol and for what religious
object games, whether of the one kind or the other, were designed. You
have festivals bearing the name of *the great Mother* <span
id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) and Apollo of Ceres too, and Neptune,
and Jupiter Latiaris, and Flora, all celebrated for a common end; the
others have their religious origin in the birthdays and solemnities of
kings, in public successes in municipal holidays.  There are also
testamentary exhibitions, in which funeral honours are rendered to the
memories of private persons; and this according to an institution of
ancient times. For from the first the “Ludi” were regarded as of two
sons, sacred and funereal, that is in honour of the heathen deities and
of the dead. But in the matter of idolatry, it makes no difference with
us under what name or title it is practised, while it has to do with the
wicked spirits whom we abjure.  If it is lawful to offer homage to the
dead, it will be just as lawful to offer it to their gods: you have the
same origin in both cases; there is the same idolatry; there is on our
part the same solemn renunciation of all idolatry.
