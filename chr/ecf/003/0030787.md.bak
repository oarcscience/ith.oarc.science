<span id="vi.vi.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Argument. Saturus, in a Vision,
and Perpetua Being Carried by Angels into the Great Light, Behold the
Martyrs. Being Brought to the Throne of God, are Received with a Kiss.
They Reconcile Optatus the Bishop and Aspasius the Presbyter.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.vi-p2"></span>1. Moreover, also, the blessed Saturus
related this his vision, which he himself committed to writing:—“We had
suffered,” says he, “and we were gone forth from the flesh, and we were
beginning to be borne by four angels into the east; and their hands
touched <span id="page_703">p. 703</span> <span
id="vi.vi.vi-Page_703"></span>us not. And we floated not supine, looking
upwards, but as if ascending a gentle slope. And being set free, we at
length saw the first boundless light; and I said, ‘Perpetua’ (for she
was at my side), ‘this is what the Lord promised to us; we have received
the promise.’ And while we are borne by those same four angels, there
appears to us a vast space which was like a pleasure-garden, having
rose-trees and every kind of flower. And the height of the trees was
after the measure of a cypress, and their leaves were falling <span
id="fr_8997"></span>[8998](#fn_8997.md) incessantly. Moreover, there in the
pleasure-garden four other angels appeared, brighter than the previous
ones, who, when they saw us, gave us honour, and said to the rest of the
angels, ‘Here they are! Here they are!’ with admiration. And those four
angels who bore us, being greatly afraid, put us down; and we passed
over on foot the space of a furlong in a broad path. There we found
Jocundus and Saturninus and Artaxius, who having suffered the same
persecution were burnt alive; and Quintus, who also himself a martyr had
departed in the prison. And we asked of them where the rest were. And
the angels said to us, ‘Come first, enter and greet your Lord.’

<span id="vi.vi.vi-p4"></span>2. “And we came near to place, the walls
of which were such as if they were built of light; and before the gate
of that place stood four angels, who clothed those who entered with
white robes. And being clothed, we entered and saw the boundless light,
and heard the united voice of some who said without ceasing, ‘Holy!
Holy! Holy!’ <span id="fr_8998"></span>[8999](#fn_8998.md) And in the midst
of that place we saw as it were a hoary man sitting, having snow-white
hair, and with a youthful countenance; and his feet we saw not.  And on
his right hand and on his left were four-and-twenty elders, and behind
them a great many others were standing.  We entered with great wonder,
and stood before the throne; and the four angels raised us up, and we
kissed Him, and He passed His hand over our face. And the rest of the
elders said to us, ‘Let us stand;’ and we stood and made peace. And the
elders said to us, ‘Go and enjoy.’ And I said, ‘Perpetua, you have what
you wish.’ And she said to me, ‘Thanks be to God, that joyous as I was
in the flesh, I am now more joyous here.’

<span id="vi.vi.vi-p6"></span>3. “And we went forth, and saw before the
entrance Optatus the bishop at the right hand, and Aspasius the
presbyter, a teacher, <span id="fr_8999"></span>[9000](#fn_8999.md) at the
left hand, separate and sad; and they cast themselves at our feet, and
said to us, ‘Restore peace between us, because you have gone forth and
have left us thus.’ And we said to them, ‘Art not thou our father, and
thou our presbyter, that you should cast yourselves at our feet?’ And we
prostrated ourselves, and we embraced them; and Perpetua began to speak
with them, and we drew them apart in the pleasure-garden under a
rose-tree.  And while we were speaking with them, the angels said unto
them, ‘Let them alone, that they may refresh themselves; <span
id="fr_9000"></span>[9001](#fn_9000.md) and if you have any dissensions
between you, forgive one another.’ And they drove them away. And they
said to Optatus, ‘Rebuke thy people, because they assemble to you as if
returning from the circus, and contending about factious matters.’ And
then it seemed to us as if they would shut the doors.  And in that place
we began to recognise many brethren, and moreover martyrs. We were all
nourished with an indescribable odour, which satisfied us.  Then, I
joyously awoke.”
