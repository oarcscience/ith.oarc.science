<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p2"></span>For, like some others, you are under the
delusion that our god is an ass’s head. <span
id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) Cor<span id="page_31">p. 31</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xvi-Page_31"></span>nelius Tacitus first put this notion into
people’s minds. In the fifth book of his histories, beginning the
(narrative of the) Jewish war with an account of the origin of the
nation; and theorizing at his pleasure about the origin, as well as the
name and the religion of the Jews, he states that having been delivered,
or rather, in his opinion, expelled from Egypt, in crossing the vast
plains of Arabia, where water is so scanty, they were in extremity from
thirst; but taking the guidance of the wild asses, which it was thought
might be seeking water after feeding, they discovered a fountain, and
thereupon in their gratitude they consecrated a head of this species of
animal. And as Christianity is nearly allied to Judaism, from this, I
suppose, it was taken for granted that we too are devoted to the worship
of the same image.  But the said Cornelius Tacitus (the very opposite of
*tacit* in telling lies) informs us in the work already mentioned, that
when Cneius Pompeius captured Jerusalem, he entered the temple to see
the arcana of the Jewish religion, but found no image there. Yet surely
if worship was rendered to any visible object, the very place for its
exhibition would be the shrine; and that all the more that the worship,
however unreasonable, had no need there to fear outside beholders.  For
entrance to the holy place was permitted to the priests alone, while all
vision was forbidden to others by an outspread curtain. You will not,
however, deny that all beasts of burden, and not parts of them, but the
animals entire, are with their goddess Epona objects of worship with
you.  It is this, perhaps, which displeases you in us, that while your
worship here is universal, we do homage only to the ass. Then, if any of
you think we render superstitious adoration to the cross, in that
adoration he is sharer with us. If you offer homage to a piece of wood
at all, it matters little what it is like when the substance is the
same: it is of no consequence the form, if you have the very body of the
god.  And yet how far does the Athenian Pallas differ from the stock of
the cross, or the Pharian Ceres as she is put up uncarved to sale, a
mere rough stake and piece of shapeless wood? Every stake fixed in an
upright position is a portion of the cross; we render our adoration, if
you will have it so, to a god entire and complete. We have shown before
that your deities are derived from shapes modelled from the cross.  But
you also worship victories, for in your trophies the cross is the heart
of the trophy. <span id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) The camp religion of
the Romans is all through a worship of the standards, a setting the
standards above all gods. Well, as those images decking out the
standards are ornaments of crosses.  All those hangings of your
standards and banners are robes of crosses. I praise your zeal: you
would not consecrate crosses unclothed and unadorned. Others, again,
certainly with more information and greater verisimilitude, believe that
the sun is our god. We shall be counted Persians perhaps, though we do
not worship the orb of day painted on a piece of linen cloth, having
himself everywhere in his own disk. The idea no doubt has originated
from our being known to turn to the east in prayer. <span
id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) But you, many of you, also under pretence
sometimes of worshipping the heavenly bodies, move your lips in the
direction of the sunrise. In the same way, if we devote Sun-day to
rejoicing, from a far different reason than Sun-worship, we have some
resemblance to those of you who devote the day of Saturn to ease and
luxury, though they too go far away from Jewish ways, of which indeed
they are ignorant. But lately a new edition of our god has been given to
the world in that great city: it originated with a certain vile man who
was wont to hire himself out to cheat the wild beasts, and who exhibited
a picture with this inscription: The God of the Christians, born of an
ass. <span id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) He had the ears of an ass, was
hoofed in one foot, carried a book, <span
id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) and wore a toga. Both the name and the
figure gave us amusement. But our opponents ought straightway to have
done homage to this biformed divinity, for they have acknowledged gods
dog-headed and lion-headed, with horn of buck and ram, with goat-like
loins, with serpent legs, with wings sprouting from back or foot. These
things we have discussed *ex abundanti*, that we might not seem
willingly to pass by any rumor against us unrefuted. Having thoroughly
cleared ourselves, we turn now to an exhibition of what our religion
really is.
