<span id="v.viii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—From Our Author’s View of a
Verse in the Ninety-Second Psalm, the Phœnix is Made a Symbol of the
Resurrection of Our Bodies.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xiii-p2"></span>If, however, all nature but faintly
figures our resurrection; if creation affords no sign precisely like it,
inasmuch as its several phenomena can hardly be said to die so much as
to come to an end, nor again be deemed to be reanimated, but only
re-formed; then take a most complete and unassailable symbol of our
hope, for it shall be an animated being, and subject alike to life and
death. I refer to the bird which is peculiar to the East, famous for its
singularity, marvelous from its posthumous life, which renews its life
in a voluntary death; its dying day is its birthday, for on it it
departs and returns; once more a phœnix where just now there was none;
once more himself, but just now out of existence; another, yet the same.
What can be more express and more significant for our subject; or to
what other thing can such a phenomenon bear witness? God even in His own
Scripture says: “*The righteous* shall flourish like the phœnix;” <span
id="fr_7366"></span>[7367](#fn_7366.md) that is, shall flourish or revive,
from death, from the grave—to teach you to believe that a bodily
substance may be recovered even from the fire. Our Lord has declared
that we are “better than many sparrows:” <span
id="fr_7367"></span>[7368](#fn_7367.md) well, if not better than many a
phœnix too, it were no great thing. But must men die once for all, while
birds in Arabia are sure of a resurrection?
