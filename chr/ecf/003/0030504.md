<span id="v.v.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—Contradictory Propositions
Advanced by Hermogenes Respecting Matter and Its Qualities.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxxv-p2"></span>As regards all other points touching
Matter, although there is no necessity why we should treat of them (for
our first point was the manifest proof of its existence), we must for
all that pursue our discussion just as if it did exist, in order that
its non-existence may be the more apparent, when these other points
concerning it prove inconsistent with each other, and in order at the
same time that Hermogenes may acknowledge his own contradictory
positions.  Matter, says he, at first sight seems to us to be
incorporeal; but when examined by *the light of* right reason, it is
found to be neither corporeal nor incorporeal. What is this right reason
of yours, <span id="fr_6505"></span>[6506](#fn_6505) which declares
nothing right, that is, nothing certain? For, if I mistake not,
everything must of necessity be either corporeal or incorporeal
(although I may for the moment <span
id="fr_6506"></span>[6507](#fn_6506) allow that there is a certain
incorporeality in even substantial things, <span
id="fr_6507"></span>[6508](#fn_6507) although their very substance is
the body of particular things); at all events, after the corporeal and
the incorporeal there is no third *state*. But if it be contended <span
id="fr_6508"></span>[6509](#fn_6508) that there is a third state
discovered by this right reason of Hermogenes, which makes Matter
neither corporeal nor incorporeal, (I ask,) Where is it? what sort of
thing is it? what is it called? what is its description? what is it
understood to be? This only has his reason declared, that Matter is
neither corporeal nor incorporeal.
