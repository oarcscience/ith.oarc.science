<span id="v.iv.v.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—A Sort of Sorites, as the
Logicians Call It, to Show that the Parables of the Lost Sheep and the
Lost Drachma Have No Suitable Application to the Christ of
Marcion.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxxii-p2"></span>Who sought after the lost sheep and
the lost piece of silver? <span id="fr_4766"></span>[4767](#fn_4766.md) Was
it not the loser? But who was the loser? Was it not he who once
possessed <span id="fr_4767"></span>[4768](#fn_4767.md) them? Who, then,
was that? Was it not he to whom they belonged? <span
id="fr_4768"></span>[4769](#fn_4768.md) Since, then, *man* is the property
of none other than the Creator, He possessed Him who owned him; He lost
him who once possessed him; He sought him who lost him; He found him who
sought him; He rejoiced who found him. Therefore the purport <span
id="fr_4769"></span>[4770](#fn_4769.md) of neither parable has anything
whatever to do with him <span id="fr_4770"></span>[4771](#fn_4770.md) to
whom belongs neither the sheep nor the piece of silver, that is to say,
*man*.  For he lost him not, because he possessed him not; and he sought
him not, because he lost him not; and he found him not, because he
sought him not; and he rejoiced not, because he found him not. 
Therefore, to rejoice over the sinner’s repentance—that is, at the
recovery of lost man—is the attribute of Him who long ago professed that
He would rather that the sinner should repent and not die.
