<span id="v.iv.iii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Trace God’s Government in
History and in His Precepts, and You Will Find It Full of His
Goodness.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xvii-p2"></span>These considerations show that the
entire order of God as Judge is an operative one, and (that I may
express myself in worthier words) protective of His Catholic <span
id="fr_2897"></span>[2898](#fn_2897.md) and supreme goodness, which,
removed as it is from judiciary emotions, and pure in its own condition,
the Marcionites refuse to acknowledge to be in one and the same Deity,
“raining on the just and on the unjust, and making His sun to rise on
the evil and on the good,” <span id="fr_2898"></span>[2899](#fn_2898.md) —a
bounty which no other god at all exercises.  It is true that Marcion has
been bold enough to erase from the gospel this testimony of Christ to
the Creator; but yet the world itself is inscribed *with the goodness of
its Maker*, and the inscription is read by each man’s conscience.  Nay,
this very long-suffering of the Creator will tend to the condemnation of
Marcion; that patience, (I mean,) which waits for the sinner’s
repentance rather than his death, which prefers mercy to
sacrifice, <span id="fr_2899"></span>[2900](#fn_2899.md) averting from the
Ninevites the ruin which had been already denounced against them, <span
id="fr_2900"></span>[2901](#fn_2900.md) and vouchsafing to Hezekiah’s tears
an extension of his life, <span id="fr_2901"></span>[2902](#fn_2901.md) and
restoring his kingly state to the monarch of Babylon after his complete
repentance; <span id="fr_2902"></span>[2903](#fn_2902.md) that mercy, too,
which conceded to the devotion of the people the son of Saul when about
to die, <span id="fr_2903"></span>[2904](#fn_2903.md) and gave free
forgiveness to David on his confessing his sins against <span
id="page_311">p. 311</span> <span id="v.iv.iii.xvii-Page_311"></span>the
house of Uriah; <span id="fr_2904"></span>[2905](#fn_2904.md) which also
restored the house of Israel as often as it condemned it, and addressed
to it consolation no less frequently than reproof. Do not therefore look
at God simply as Judge, but turn your attention also to examples of His
conduct as the Most Good. <span id="fr_2905"></span>[2906](#fn_2905.md)
Noting Him, as you do, when He takes vengeance, consider Him likewise
when He shows mercy. <span id="fr_2906"></span>[2907](#fn_2906.md) In the
scale, against His severity place His gentleness. When you shall have
discovered both qualities to co-exist in the Creator, you will find in
Him that very circumstance which induces you to think there is another
God. Lastly, come and examine into His doctrine, discipline, precepts,
and counsels. You will perhaps say that there are equally good
prescriptions in human laws. But Moses and God existed before all your
Lycurguses and Solons. There is not one after-age <span
id="fr_2907"></span>[2908](#fn_2907.md) which does not take from primitive
sources.  At any rate, my Creator did not learn from your God to issue
such commandments as: Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit
adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou
shalt not covet what is thy neighbour’s; honour thy father and thy
mother; and, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. To these prime
counsels of innocence, chastity, and justice, and piety, are also added
prescriptions of humanity, as when every seventh year slaves are
released for liberty; <span id="fr_2908"></span>[2909](#fn_2908.md) when at
the same period the land is spared from tillage; a place is also granted
to the needy; and from the treading ox’s mouth the muzzle is removed,
for the enjoyment of the fruit of his labour before him, in order that
kindness first shown in the case of animals might be raised from such
rudiments <span id="fr_2909"></span>[2910](#fn_2909.md) to the
refreshment <span id="fr_2910"></span>[2911](#fn_2910.md) of men.
