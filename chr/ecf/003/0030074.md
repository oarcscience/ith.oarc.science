<span id="iv.iv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Concerning Private
Festivals.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xvi-p2"></span>Touching the ceremonies, however, of
private and social solemnities—as those of the white toga, of espousals,
of nuptials, of name-givings—I should think no danger need be guarded
against from the breath of the idolatry which is mixed up with them. For
the causes are to be considered to which the ceremony is due. Those
above-named I take to be clean in themselves, because neither manly
garb, nor the marital ring or union, descends from honours done to any
idol. In short, I find no dress cursed by God, except a woman’s dress on
a man: <span id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) for “cursed,” saith He,
“is every man who clothes himself in woman’s attire.” The toga, however,
is a dress of manly *name* as well as *of manly use*. <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) God no more prohibits nuptials to be
celebrated than a name to be given. “But there are sacrifices
appropriated to these occasions.” Let me be invited, and let not the
title of the ceremony be “assistance at a sacrifice,” and the discharge
of my good offices is at the service *of my friends*. Would that it were
“at *their* service” indeed, and that we could escape *seeing* what is
unlawful for us to *do*.  But since the evil one has so surrounded the
world with idolatry, it will be lawful for us to be present at some
ceremonies which see us doing service to a *man*, not to an *idol*. 
Clearly, if invited unto priestly function and sacrifice, I will not go,
for that is service peculiar to an idol; but neither will I furnish
advice, or expense, or any other good office in a matter of *that* kind.
If it is on account of the *sacrifice* that I be invited, and stand by,
I shall be partaker of idolatry; if any *other* cause conjoins me to the
sacrificer, I shall be merely a spectator of the sacrifice. <span

<span id="iv.iv.xvi-p3"></span> Tertullian should have added, “and a
man’s on a woman.” See [Deut. xxii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.iv.xvi-p3.1"></span>.
Moreover, the word “cursed” is not used there, but “abomination” is.

<span id="iv.iv.xvi-p4"></span> Because it was called *toga
virilis*—“the *manly* toga.”
