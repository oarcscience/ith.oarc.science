<span id="v.viii.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIV.—Sundry Other Passages of St.
Paul Explained in a Sentence Confirmatory of Our Doctrine.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xliv-p2"></span>Now, if you will examine the words
which precede the passage where mention is made of the outward and the
inward man, will you not discover the whole truth, both of the dignity
and the hope of the flesh? For, when he speaks of the “light which God
hath commanded to shine in our hearts, to give the light of the
knowledge of the glory of the Lord in the person of Jesus Christ,” <span
id="fr_7571"></span>[7572](#fn_7571.md) and says that “we have this
treasure in earthen vessels,” <span id="fr_7572"></span>[7573](#fn_7572.md)
meaning of course the flesh, which is meant—that the flesh shall be
destroyed, because it is “an earthen vessel,” deriving its origin from
clay; or that it is to be glorified, as being the receptacle of a divine
treasure? Now if that true light, which is in the person of Christ,
contains in itself life, and that life with its light is committed to
the flesh, is that destined to perish which has life entrusted to it?
Then, of course, the treasure will perish also; for perishable things
are entrusted to things which are themselves perishable, which is like
putting new wine into old bottles. When also he adds, “Always bearing
about in our body the dying of *the Lord* Jesus Christ,” <span
id="fr_7573"></span>[7574](#fn_7573.md) what sort of substance is that
which, after (being called) the temple of God, can now be also
designated the tomb of Christ?  But why do we bear about in the body the
dying of the Lord? In order, as he says, “that His life also may be
manifested.” <span id="fr_7574"></span>[7575](#fn_7574.md) Where?  “In the
body.” In what body? “In our mortal body.” <span
id="fr_7575"></span>[7576](#fn_7575.md) Therefore in the flesh, which is
mortal indeed through sin, but living through grace—how great a grace
you may see when the purpose is, “that the life of Christ may be
manifested in it.” Is it then in a thing which is a stranger to
salvation, in a substance which is perpetually dissolved, that the life
of Christ will be manifested, which is eternal, continuous,
incorruptible, and already the life of God? Else to what epoch belongs
that life of the Lord which is to be manifested in our body? It surely
is the life which He lived up to His passion, which was not only openly
shown among the Jews, but has now been displayed even to all nations.
Therefore that life is meant which “has broken the adamantine gates of
death and the brazen bars of the lower world,” <span
id="fr_7576"></span>[7577](#fn_7576.md) —a life which thenceforth has been
and will be ours. Lastly, it is to be manifested in the body. When?
After death.  How? By rising in our body, as Christ also *rose in His*.
But lest any one should here object, that the life of Jesus has even now
to be manifested in our body by the discipline of holiness, and
patience, and righteousness, and wisdom, in which the Lord’s life
abounded, the most provident wisdom of the apostle inserts this purpose:
“For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that
His life may be manifested in our mortal body.” <span
id="fr_7577"></span>[7578](#fn_7577.md) In us, therefore, even when dead,
does he say that this is to take place in us. And if so, how is this
possible except in our body after its resurrection? Therefore he adds in
the concluding sentence: “Knowing that He which raised up *the Lord*
Jesus, shall raise up us also with Him,” <span
id="fr_7578"></span>[7579](#fn_7578.md) risen as He is already from the
dead.  But perhaps “*with* Him” means “*like* Him:” well then, if it be
*like* Him, it is not of course without the flesh.
