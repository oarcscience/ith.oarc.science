<span id="iv.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V. <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) —Sundry Objections or Excuses Dealt
with.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.v-p3"></span>We will certainly take more pains in
answering the excuses of artificers of this kind, who ought never to be
admitted into the house of God, if any have a knowledge of that
Discipline. <span id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) To begin with, that
speech, wont to be cast in our teeth, “I have nothing else whereby to
live,” may be more severely retorted, “You have, then, whereby to live? 
If by your own laws, what have you to do with God?” <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) Then, as to the argument they have the
hardihood to bring even from the Scriptures, “that the apostle has said,
‘As each has been found, so let him persevere.’” <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) We may all, therefore, persevere in
*sins*, as the result of *that* interpretation! for there is not any one
of us who has not been found as a *sinner*, since no other cause was the
source of Christ’s descent than that of setting *sinners* free. Again,
they say the same apostle has left a precept, according to his own
example, “That each one work with his own hands for a living.” <span
id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) If this precept is maintained in
respect to *all* hands, I believe even the bath-thieves <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) live by their hands, and robbers
themselves gain the means to live by their hands; forgers, again,
execute their evil handwritings, not of course with their feet, but
hands; actors, however, achieve a livelihood not with hands alone, but
with their entire limbs. Let the Church, therefore, stand open to *all*
who are supported by their hands and by their own work; if there is no
exception of arts which the Discipline of God receives not. But some one
says, in opposition to our proposition of “similitude being
interdicted,” “Why, then, did Moses in the desert make a likeness of a
serpent out of bronze?” The figures, which used to be laid as a
groundwork for some secret future dispensation, not with a view to the
repeal of the law, but as a type of their own final cause, stand in a
class by themselves. Otherwise, if we should interpret these things as
the adversaries of the law do, do we, too, as the Marcionites do,
ascribe inconsistency to the Almighty, whom *they* <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) in this manner destroy as being
mutable, while in one place He forbids, in another commands? But if any
feigns ignorance of the fact that that effigy of the serpent of bronze,
after the manner of one uphung, denoted the shape of the Lord’s
cross, <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) which <span
id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span id="iv.iv.v-Page_64"></span>was to free
us from serpents—that is, from the devil’s angels—while, through itself,
it hanged up the devil slain; or whatever other exposition of that
figure has been revealed to worthier men <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) no matter, provided we remember the
apostle affirms that all things happened at that time to the
People <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) *figuratively*. <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) It is enough that the same God, as by
law He forbade the making of similitude, did, by the extraordinary
precept in the case of the serpent, interdict similitude. <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) If you reverence the same God, you
have His law, “Thou shalt make no similitude.” <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) If you look back, too, to the precept
enjoining the subsequently made similitude, do you, too, imitate Moses:
make not any likeness in opposition to the law, unless to *you*, too,
God have bidden it. <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v-p4"></span> i.e., the Discipline of the house of God,
the Church. Oehler reads, “*eam* disciplinam,” and takes the meaning to
be that no artificer of this class should be admitted into the Church,
if he applies for admittance, with a knowledge of the law of God
referred to in the former chapters, yet persisting in his unlawful
craft. Fr. Junius would read, “*ejus* disciplinam.”

<span id="iv.iv.v-p5"></span> i.e., If laws of your own, and not the
will and law of God, are the source and means of your life, you owe no
thanks and no obedience to God, and therefore need not seek admittance
into His house (Oehler).

<span id="iv.iv.v-p10"></span> \[The argument amounts to this, that
*symbols* were not *idols*:  yet even so, God only could ordain
*symbols* that were innocent. The *<span class="c42"><span

the “peril of Idolatry” ([2 Kings xviii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004)<span id="iv.iv.v-p10.2"></span>.md) and
that even a divine symbol may be destroyed justly if it be turned to a
violation of the Second Commandment.\]

<span id="iv.iv.v-p12"></span> i.e., the *Jewish* people, who are
generally meant by the expression “the People” in the singular number in
Scripture. We shall endeavour to mark that distinction by writing the
word, as here, with a capital.

id="iv.iv.v-p13.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.v-p14"></span> On the principle that the exception
proves the rule. As Oehler explains it: “By the fact of the
extraordinary precept in that particular case, God gave an indication
that likeness-making had before been forbidden and interdicted by Him.”

etc. \[The absurd “brazen serpent” which I have seen in the Church of
St. Ambrose, in Milan, is with brazen hardihood affirmed to be the
identical serpent which Moses lifted up in the wilderness. But it lacks
all *symbolic* character, as it is not set upon a pole nor in any way
fitted to a cross. It greatly resembles a *vane* set upon a pivot.\]
