<span id="iv.vii.i-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.i-p7.1"></span>We</span> are not in any great perturbation or
alarm about the persecutions we suffer from the ignorance of men; for we
have attached ourselves to this sect, fully accepting the terms of its
covenant, so that, as men whose very lives are not their own, we engage
in these conflicts, our desire being to obtain God’s promised rewards,
and our dread lest the woes with which He threatens an unchristian life
should overtake us. Hence we shrink not from the grapple with your
utmost rage, coming even forth of our own accord to the contest; and
condemnation gives us more pleasure than acquittal. We have sent,
therefore, this tract to you in no alarm about ourselves, but in much
concern for you and for all our enemies, to say nothing of our friends.
For our religion commands us to love even our enemies, and to pray for
those who persecute us, aiming at a perfection all its own, and seeking
in its disciples something of a higher type than the commonplace
goodness of the world. For all love those who love them; it is peculiar
to Christians alone to love those that hate them. Therefore mourning
over your ignorance, and compassionating human error, and looking on to
that future of which every day shows threatening signs, necessity is
laid on us to come forth in this way also, that we may set before you
the truths you will not listen to openly.

author’s life, this tract contains no trace of Montanism, and shows that
his heart was with the common cause of all Christians. Who can give up
such an Ephraim without recalling the words of inspired love for the
erring?— [Jer. 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020.md), [Hos.
