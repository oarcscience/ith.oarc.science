<span id="v.iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—A Proper Seeking After Divine
Knowledge, Which Will Never Be Out of Place or Excessive, is Always
Within the Rule of Faith.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xii-p2"></span>As for us, although we must still seek,
and *that* always, yet where ought our search to be made?  Amongst the
heretics, where all things are foreign <span
id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988.md) and opposed to our own verity, and
to whom we are forbidden to draw near? What slave looks for food from a
stranger, not to say an enemy of his master? What soldier expects to get
bounty and pay from kings who are unallied, I might almost say
hostile—unless forsooth he be a deserter, and a runaway, and a rebel?
Even that old woman <span id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989.md) searched
for the piece of silver within her own house. It was also at his
neighbour’s door that the persevering assailant kept knocking. Nor was
it to a hostile judge, although a severe one, that the widow made her
appeal. No man gets instruction <span
id="fr_1990"></span>[1991](#fn_1990.md) from that which tends to
destruction. <span id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991.md) No man receives
illumination from a quarter where all is darkness. Let our “seeking,”
therefore be in that which is our own, and from those who are our own:
and concerning that which is our own,—that, and only that, <span
id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992.md) which can become an object of
inquiry without impairing the rule of faith.
