<span id="v.iv.vi.vii-p2"></span>“And the hidden things of darkness He
will Himself bring to light,” <span id="fr_5471"></span>[5472](#fn_5471.md)
even by Christ; for He has promised Christ to be a Light, <span
id="fr_5472"></span>[5473](#fn_5472.md) and Himself He has declared to be a
lamp, “searching the hearts and reins.” <span
id="fr_5473"></span>[5474](#fn_5473.md) From Him also shall “praise be had
by every man,” <span id="fr_5474"></span>[5475](#fn_5474.md) from whom
proceeds, as from a judge, the opposite also of praise. But here, at
least, you say he interprets the world to be the God thereof, when he
says:  “We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to
men.” <span id="fr_5475"></span>[5476](#fn_5475.md) For if by world he had
meant the people thereof, he would not have afterwards specially
mentioned “*men*.” To prevent, however, your using such an argument as
this, the Holy Ghost has providentially explained the meaning of the
passage thus:  “We are made a spectacle to the world,” *i.e.* “both to
*angels*,” who minister therein, “and to *men*,” who are the objects of
their ministration. <span id="fr_5476"></span>[5477](#fn_5476.md) Of
course, <span id="fr_5477"></span>[5478](#fn_5477.md) a man of the noble
courage of our apostle (to say nothing of the Holy Ghost) was afraid,
when writing to the children whom he had begotten in <span
id="page_443">p. 443</span> <span id="v.iv.vi.vii-Page_443"></span>the
gospel, to speak freely of the God of the world; for against Him he
could not possibly seem to have a word to say, except only in a
straightforward manner! <span id="fr_5478"></span>[5479](#fn_5478.md) I
quite admit, that, according to the Creator’s law, <span
id="fr_5479"></span>[5480](#fn_5479.md) the man was an offender “who had
his father’s wife.” <span id="fr_5480"></span>[5481](#fn_5480.md) He
followed, no doubt, <span id="fr_5481"></span>[5482](#fn_5481.md) the
principles of natural and public law.  When, however, he condemns the
man “to be delivered unto Satan,” <span
id="fr_5482"></span>[5483](#fn_5482.md) he becomes the herald of an
avenging God.  It does not matter <span
id="fr_5483"></span>[5484](#fn_5483.md) that he also said, “For the
destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the
Lord,” <span id="fr_5484"></span>[5485](#fn_5484.md) since both in the
destruction of the flesh and in the saving of the spirit there is, on
His part, judicial process; and when he bade “the wicked person be put
away from the midst of them,” <span id="fr_5485"></span>[5486](#fn_5485.md)
he only mentioned what is a very frequently recurring sentence of the
Creator. “Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are
unleavened.” <span id="fr_5486"></span>[5487](#fn_5486.md) The unleavened
bread was therefore, in the Creator’s ordinance, a figure of us
(Christians). “For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.” <span
id="fr_5487"></span>[5488](#fn_5487.md) But why is Christ our passover, if
the passover be not a type of Christ, in the similitude of the blood
which saves, and of the Lamb, which is Christ? <span
id="fr_5488"></span>[5489](#fn_5488) Why does (the apostle.md) clothe us
and Christ with symbols of the Creator’s solemn rites, unless they had
relation to ourselves? When, again, he warns us against fornication, he
reveals the resurrection of the flesh. “The body,” says he, “is not for
fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body,” <span
id="fr_5489"></span>[5490](#fn_5489.md) just as the temple is for God, and
God for the temple. A temple will therefore pass away <span
id="fr_5490"></span>[5491](#fn_5490.md) with its god, and its god with the
temple.  You see, then, how that “He who raised up the Lord will also
raise us up.” <span id="fr_5491"></span>[5492](#fn_5491.md) In the body
will He raise us, because the body is for the Lord, and the Lord for the
body. And suitably does he add the question: “Know ye not that your
bodies are the members of Christ?” <span
id="fr_5492"></span>[5493](#fn_5492.md) What has the heretic to say? That
these members of Christ will not rise again, for they are no longer our
own?  “For,” he says, “ye are bought with a price.” <span
id="fr_5493"></span>[5494](#fn_5493.md) A price! surely none at all was
paid, since Christ was a phantom, nor had He any corporeal substance
which He could pay for our bodies! But, in truth, Christ had wherewithal
to redeem us; and since He has redeemed, at a great price, these bodies
of ours, against which fornication must not be committed (because they
are now members of Christ, and not our own), surely He will secure, on
His own account, the safety of those whom He made His own at so much
cost! Now, how shall we glorify, how shall we exalt, God in our
body, <span id="fr_5494"></span>[5495](#fn_5494.md) which is doomed to
perish? We must now encounter the subject of marriage, which Marcion,
more continent <span id="fr_5495"></span>[5496](#fn_5495.md) than the
apostle, prohibits. For the apostle, although preferring the grace of
continence, <span id="fr_5496"></span>[5497](#fn_5496.md) yet permits the
contraction of marriage and the enjoyment of it, <span
id="fr_5497"></span>[5498](#fn_5497.md) and advises the continuance therein
rather than the dissolution thereof. <span
id="fr_5498"></span>[5499](#fn_5498.md) Christ plainly forbids divorce,
Moses unquestionably permits it. <span
id="fr_5499"></span>[5500](#fn_5499.md)

<span id="v.iv.vi.vii-p32"></span>Now, when Marcion wholly prohibits all
carnal intercourse to the faithful (for we will say nothing <span
id="fr_5500"></span>[5501](#fn_5500) about his catechumens.md), and when he
prescribes repudiation of all engagements before marriage, whose
teaching does he follow, that of Moses or of Christ? Even Christ, <span
id="fr_5501"></span>[5502](#fn_5501.md) however, when He here commands “the
wife not to depart from her husband, or if she depart, to remain
unmarried or be reconciled to her husband,” <span
id="fr_5502"></span>[5503](#fn_5502.md) both permitted divorce, which
indeed He never absolutely prohibited, and confirmed (the sanctity) of
marriage, by first forbidding its dissolution; and, if separation had
taken place, by wishing the nuptial bond to be resumed by
reconciliation. But what reasons does (the apostle) allege for
continence?  Because “the time is short.” <span
id="fr_5503"></span>[5504](#fn_5503.md) I had almost thought it was because
in Christ there was another god! And yet He from whom emanates this
shortness of the time, will also send what suits the said brevity. No
one makes provision for the time which is another’s. You degrade your
god, O Marcion, when you make him circumscribed at all by the Creator’s
time. Assuredly also, when (the apostle) rules that marriage should be
“only in the Lord,” <span id="fr_5504"></span>[5505](#fn_5504.md) that no
Christian should intermarry with a <span id="page_444">p. 444</span>
<span id="v.iv.vi.vii-Page_444"></span>heathen, he maintains a law of
the Creator, who everywhere prohibits marriage with strangers. But when
he says, “although there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or
in earth,” <span id="fr_5505"></span>[5506](#fn_5505.md) the meaning of his
words is clear—not as if there were gods in reality, but as if there
were some who are called gods, without being truly so. He introduces his
discussion about meats offered to idols with a statement concerning
idols (themselves): “We know that an idol is nothing in the
world.” <span id="fr_5506"></span>[5507](#fn_5506.md) Marcion, however,
does not say that the Creator is not God; so that the apostle can hardly
be thought to have ranked the Creator amongst those who are called gods,
without being so; since, even if they had been gods, “to us there is but
one God, the Father.” <span id="fr_5507"></span>[5508](#fn_5507.md) Now,
from whom do all things come to us, but from Him to whom all things
belong? And pray, what things are these? You have them in a preceding
part of the epistle:  “All things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos,
or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things
to come.” <span id="fr_5508"></span>[5509](#fn_5508.md) He makes the
Creator, then the God of all things, from whom proceed both the world
and life and death, which cannot possibly belong to the other god. From
Him, therefore, amongst the “*all things*” comes also Christ. <span
id="fr_5509"></span>[5510](#fn_5509.md) When he teaches that every man
ought to live of his own industry, <span
id="fr_5510"></span>[5511](#fn_5510.md) he begins with a copious induction
of examples—of soldiers, and shepherds, and husbandmen. <span
id="fr_5511"></span>[5512](#fn_5511.md) But he <span
id="fr_5512"></span>[5513](#fn_5512.md) wanted divine authority. What was
the use, however, of adducing the Creator’s, which he was destroying? It
was vain to do so; for his god had no such authority! (The apostle)
says: “Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn,” <span
id="fr_5513"></span>[5514](#fn_5513.md) and adds: “Doth God take care of
oxen?” Yes, of oxen, for the sake of men! For, says he, “it is written
for our sakes.” <span id="fr_5514"></span>[5515](#fn_5514.md) Thus he
showed that the law had a symbolic reference to ourselves, and that it
gives its sanction in favour of those who live of the gospel. (He
showed) also, that those who preach the gospel are on this account sent
by no other god but Him to whom belongs the law, which made provision
for them, when he says: “For our sakes was this written.” <span
id="fr_5515"></span>[5516](#fn_5515.md) Still he declined to use this power
which the law gave him, because he preferred working without any
restraint. <span id="fr_5516"></span>[5517](#fn_5516.md) Of this he
boasted, and suffered no man to rob him of such glory <span
id="fr_5517"></span>[5518](#fn_5517.md) —certainly with no view of
destroying the law, which he proved that another man might use. For
behold Marcion, in his blindness, stumbled at the rock whereof our
fathers drank in the wilderness. For since “that rock was Christ,” <span
id="fr_5518"></span>[5519](#fn_5518.md) it was, of course, the Creator’s,
to whom also belonged the people. But why resort to the figure of a
sacred sign given by an extraneous god? <span
id="fr_5519"></span>[5520](#fn_5519.md) Was it to teach the very truth,
that ancient things prefigured the Christ who was to be educed <span
id="fr_5520"></span>[5521](#fn_5520.md) out of them? For, being about to
take a cursory view of what befell the people (of Israel) he begins with
saying: “Now these things happened as examples for us.” <span
id="fr_5521"></span>[5522](#fn_5521.md) Now, tell me, were these examples
given by the Creator to men belonging to a rival god?  Or did one god
borrow examples from another, and a hostile one too? He withdraws me to
himself in alarm <span id="fr_5522"></span>[5523](#fn_5522.md) from Him
from whom he transfers my allegiance.  Will his antagonist make me
better disposed to him? Should I now commit the same sins as the people,
shall I have to suffer the same penalties, or not? <span
id="fr_5523"></span>[5524](#fn_5523.md) But if not the same, how vainly
does he propose to me terrors which I shall not have to endure! From
whom, again, shall I have to endure them? If from the Creator, What
evils does it appertain to *Him* to inflict? And how will it happen
that, jealous God as He is, He shall punish the man who offends His
rival, instead of rather encouraging <span
id="fr_5524"></span>[5525](#fn_5524.md) him. If, however, from the other
god—but *he* knows not how to punish. So that the whole declaration of
the apostle lacks a reasonable basis, if it is not meant to relate to
the Creator’s discipline. But the fact is, the apostle’s conclusion
corresponds to the beginning:  “Now all these things happened unto them
for ensamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the
ends of the world are come.” <span id="fr_5525"></span>[5526](#fn_5525.md)
What a Creator! how prescient already, and considerate in warning
Christians who belong to another god! Whenever cavils occur the like to
those which have been already dealt with, I pass them by; certain others
I despatch briefly. A great argument for another god is the permission
to eat of all kinds of meats, contrary to the law. <span
id="fr_5526"></span>[5527](#fn_5526.md) Just as if we did not ourselves
allow that the burdensome <span id="page_445">p. 445</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.vii-Page_445"></span>ordinances of the law were
abrogated—but by Him who imposed them, who also promised the new
condition of things. <span id="fr_5527"></span>[5528](#fn_5527.md) The
same, therefore, who prohibited meats, also restored the use of them,
just as He had indeed allowed them from the beginning. If, however, some
strange god had come to destroy our God, his foremost prohibition would
certainly have been, that his own votaries should abstain from
supporting their lives on the resources of his adversary.
