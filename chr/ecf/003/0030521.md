<span id="v.vi.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Although Writing in Latin He
Proposes to Retain the Greek Names of the Valentinian Emanations of
Deity.  Not to Discuss the Heresy But Only to Expose It. This with the
Raillery Which Its Absurdity Merits.</span>

<span id="v.vi.vi-p2"></span>In order then, that no one may be blinded
by so many outlandish <span id="fr_6672"></span>[6673](#fn_6672.md) names,
collected together, and adjusted at pleasure, <span
id="fr_6673"></span>[6674](#fn_6673.md) and of doubtful import, I mean in
this little work, wherein we merely undertake to propound this
(heretical) mystery, to explain in what manner we are to use them. Now
the rendering of some of these *names* from the Greek so as to produce
an equally obvious sense of the word, is by no means an easy process: in
the case of some others, the genders are not suitable; while others,
again, are more familiarly known in their Greek form. For the most part,
therefore, we shall use the Greek names; their meanings will be seen on
the margins of the pages. Nor will the Greek be unaccompanied with the
Latin *equivalents*; only these will be marked in lines above, for the
purpose of explaining <span id="fr_6674"></span>[6675](#fn_6674.md) the
personal names, rendered necessary by the ambiguities of such of them as
admit some different meaning. But although I must postpone all
discussion, and be content at present with the mere exposition (of the
heresy), still, wherever any scandalous feature shall seem to require a
castigation, it must be attacked <span
id="fr_6675"></span>[6676](#fn_6675.md) by all means, if only with a
passing thrust. <span id="fr_6676"></span>[6677](#fn_6676.md) Let the
reader regard it as the skirmish before the battle. It will be my drift
to show how to wound <span id="fr_6677"></span>[6678](#fn_6677.md) rather
than to inflict deep gashes. If in any instance mirth be excited, this
will be quite as much as the subject deserves. There are many things
which deserve refutation in such a way as to have no gravity expended on
them. Vain and silly topics are met with especial fitness by laughter.
Even the truth may indulge in ridicule, because it is jubilant; it may
play with its enemies, because it is fearless. <span
id="fr_6678"></span>[6679](#fn_6678.md) Only we must take care that its
laughter be not unseemly, and so itself be laughed at; but wherever its
mirth is decent, there it is a duty *to indulge it*. And so at last I
enter on my task.
