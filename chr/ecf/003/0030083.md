<span id="iv.iv.xxv-p4"></span>(The Second Commandment, p. 64*.)*

<span id="iv.iv.xxv-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.xxv-p5.1"></span>Tertullian’s</span> teaching agrees with that
of Clement of Alexandria <span id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345) and
with all the Primitive Fathers. But compare the Trent Catechism,
(chapter ii., quest. 17.)—“Nor let any one suppose that this commandment
prohibits the arts of painting, modelling or sculpture, *for*, in the
Scriptures we are informed that God himself commanded images of
cherubim, and *also of the brazen serpent*, to be made, etc.” So far,
the comparison is important, because while our author limits any
inference from this instance as an *exception*, this Catechism turns it
into a *rule*: and so far, we are only looking at the matter with
reference to Art. But, the Catechism, (quest. xxiii. xxiv.), goes on to
teach that images of the Saints, *etc*. ought to be made and honoured
“as a holy practice.” It affirms, also, that it is a practice which has
been *attended with the greatest advantage to the faithful*: which
admits of a doubt, especially when the *honour* thus mentioned is
everywhere turned into *worship*, precisely like that offered to the
Brazen Serpent, when the People “burned incense to it,” and often much
more. But even this is not my point; for that Catechism, with what
verity need not be argued, affirms, also, that this doctrine “*derives
confirmation* from the monuments of the Apostolic age, the general
Councils of the Church, and the writings of so many most holy and
learned Fathers, *who are of one accord upon the subject.*” Doubtless
they are “of one accord,” but all the other way.

<span id="iv.iv.xxv-p8"></span>(Military service, cap. xix., p. 73.)

<span id="iv.iv.xxv-p9"></span>This chapter must prepare us for a much
more sweeping condemnation of the military profession in the *De
Spectaculis* and the *De Corona*; but Neander’s judgment seems to me
very just. The *Corona*, itself, is rather Montanistic than Montanist,
in the opinion of some critics, among whom Gibbon is not to count for
much, for the reasons given by Kaye (p. 52), and others hardly less
obvious. Surely, if this ascetic opinion and some similar instances were
enough to mark a man as a heretic, what are we to say of the thousand
crotchets maintained by good Christians, in our day?

<span id="iv.iv.xxv-p11"></span>(Passive idolatry, cap. xxii., pp. 74,
75.)

<span id="iv.iv.xxv-p12"></span>Neander’s opinion as to the freedom of
*De Idololatria* from Montanistic taint, is mildly questioned by Bp.
Kaye, chiefly on the ground of the agreement of this chapter with the
extravagances of the *Scorpiace*. He thinks “the utmost pitch” of such
extravagance is reached in the positions here taken. But Neander’s
judgment seems to me preferable. Lapsers usually give tokens of the bent
of their minds, and unconsciously betray their inclinations before they
themselves see whither they are tending.  Thus they become victims of
their own plausible self-deceptions.

<span id="iv.iv.xxv-p14"></span>(Tacit consents and reservations, cap.
xxiii., p. 75.)

<span id="iv.iv.xxv-p15"></span>It cannot be doubted that apart from the
specific case which Tertullian is here maintaining, his appeal to
conscience is maintained by reason, by the Morals of the Fathers and by
Holy Scripture. Now compare with this the Morality which has been made
dogmatic, among Latins, by the elevation of Liguori to the dignities of
a “Saint” and a “Doctor of the Church.” Even Cardinal Newman cannot
accept it without *reservations*, so thoroughly does it commit the soul
to fraud and hypocrisy.  See Liguori, *Opp. Tom.* II., pp. 34–44, and
Meyrick, *Moral Theology of the Church of Rome*, London, 1855. 
Republished, with an Introduction, by the Editor of this Series,
Baltimore, 1857. Also Newman, *Apologia*, p. 295 *et seqq.*
