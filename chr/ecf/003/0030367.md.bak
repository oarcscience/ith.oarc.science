<span id="v.iv.iii.xxiii-Page_315"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—God’s Purposes in
Election and Rejection of the Same Men, Such as King Saul, Explained, in
Answer to the Marcionite Cavil.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xxiii-p2"></span>Now, although you will have it that
He is inconstant <span id="fr_2979"></span>[2980](#fn_2979.md) in respect
of persons, sometimes disapproving where approbation is deserved; or
else wanting in foresight, bestowing approbation on men who ought rather
to be reprobated, as if He either censured <span
id="fr_2980"></span>[2981](#fn_2980.md) His own past judgments, or could
not forecast His future ones; yet <span
id="fr_2981"></span>[2982](#fn_2981.md) nothing is so consistent for even a
good judge <span id="fr_2982"></span>[2983](#fn_2982.md) as both to reject
and to choose on the merits of the present moment. Saul is chosen, <span
id="fr_2983"></span>[2984](#fn_2983.md) but he is not yet the despiser of
the prophet Samuel. <span id="fr_2984"></span>[2985](#fn_2984.md) Solomon
is rejected; but he is now become a prey to foreign women, and a slave
to the idols of Moab and Sidon. What must the Creator do, in order to
escape the censure of the Marcionites? Must He prematurely condemn men,
who are thus far correct in their conduct, because of future
delinquencies? But it is not the mark of a good God to condemn
beforehand persons who have not yet deserved condemnation. Must He then
refuse to eject sinners, on account of their previous good deeds? But it
is not the characteristic of a just judge to forgive sins in
consideration of former virtues which are no longer practised. Now, who
is so faultless among men, that God could always have him in His choice,
and never be able to reject him? Or who, on the other hand, is so void
of any good work, that God could reject him for ever, and never be able
to choose him? Show me, then, the man who is always good, and he will
not be rejected; show me, too, him who is always evil, and he will never
be chosen.  Should, however, the same man, being found on different
occasions in the pursuit of both (good and evil) be recompensed <span
id="fr_2985"></span>[2986](#fn_2985.md) in both directions by God, who is
both a good and judicial Being, He does not change His judgments through
inconstancy or want of foresight, but dispenses reward according to the
deserts of each case with a most unwavering and provident
decision. <span id="fr_2986"></span>[2987](#fn_2986.md)
