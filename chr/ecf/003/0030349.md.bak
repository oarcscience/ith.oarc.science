<span id="v.iv.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Marcion’s Cavils Considered. His
Objection Refuted, I.e., Man’s Fall Showed Failure in God. The
Perfection of Man’s Being Lay in His Liberty, Which God Purposely
Bestowed on Him. The Fall Imputable to Man’s Own Choice.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.v-p2"></span>Now then, ye dogs, whom the apostle puts
outside, <span id="fr_2760"></span>[2761](#fn_2760.md) and who yelp at the
God of truth, let us come to your various questions. These are the bones
of contention, which you are perpetually gnawing! If God is good, and
prescient of the future, and able to avert evil, why did He permit man,
the very image and likeness of Himself, and, by the origin of his soul,
His own substance too, to be deceived by the devil, and fall from
obedience of the law into death? For if He had been good, and so
unwilling that such a catastrophe should happen, and prescient, so as
not to be ignorant of what was to come to pass, and powerful enough to
hinder its occurrence, that issue would never have come about, which
should be impossible under these three conditions of the divine
greatness. Since, however, it has occurred, the contrary proposition is
most certainly true, that God must <span id="page_301">p. 301</span>
<span id="v.iv.iii.v-Page_301"></span>be deemed neither good, nor
prescient, nor powerful. For *as* no such issue could have happened had
God been such as He is reputed—good, and prescient, and mighty—*so* has
this issue actually happened, because He is not such a God. In reply, we
must first vindicate those attributes in the Creator which are called in
question—namely, His goodness and foreknowledge, and power. But I shall
not linger long over this point <span
id="fr_2761"></span>[2762](#fn_2761.md) for Christ’s own definition <span
id="fr_2762"></span>[2763](#fn_2762.md) comes to our aid at once. From
works must proofs be obtained. The Creator’s works testify at once to
His goodness, since they are good, as we have shown, and to His power,
since they are mighty, and spring indeed out of nothing. And even if
they were made out of some (previous) matter, as some <span
id="fr_2763"></span>[2764](#fn_2763.md) will have it, they are even thus
out of nothing, because they *were* not what they *are*. In short, both
they are great because they are good; and <span
id="fr_2764"></span>[2765](#fn_2764.md) God is likewise mighty, because all
things are His own, whence He is almighty. But what shall I say of His
prescience, which has for its witnesses as many prophets as it inspired?
After all, <span id="fr_2765"></span>[2766](#fn_2765.md) what title to
prescience do we look for in the Author of the universe, since it was by
this very attribute that He foreknew all things when He appointed them
their places, and appointed them their places when He foreknew them?
There is sin itself. If He had not foreknown this, He would not have
proclaimed a caution against it under the penalty of death. Now if there
were in God such attributes as must have rendered it both impossible and
improper for any evil to have happened to man, <span
id="fr_2766"></span>[2767](#fn_2766.md) and yet evil did occur, let us
consider man’s condition also—whether *it* were not, in fact, rather the
cause why that came to pass which could not have happened through God. I
find, then, that man was by God constituted free, master of his own will
and power; indicating the presence of God’s image and likeness in him by
nothing so well as by this constitution of his nature. For it was not by
his face, and by the lineaments of his body, though they were so varied
in his human nature, that he expressed his likeness to the form of God;
but he showed his stamp <span id="fr_2767"></span>[2768](#fn_2767.md) in
that essence which he derived from God Himself (that is, the
spiritual, <span id="fr_2768"></span>[2769](#fn_2768.md) which answered to
the form of God), and in the freedom and power of his will. This his
state was confirmed even by the very law which God then imposed upon
him. For a law would not be imposed upon one who had it not in his power
to render that obedience which is due to law; nor again, would the
penalty of death be threatened against sin, if a contempt of the law
were impossible to man in the liberty of his will. So in the Creator’s
subsequent laws also you will find, when He sets before man good and
evil, life and death, that the entire course of discipline is arranged
in precepts by God’s calling men from sin, and threatening and exhorting
them; and this on no other ground than <span
id="fr_2769"></span>[2770](#fn_2769.md) that man is free, with a will
either for obedience or resistance.
