<span id="v.iv.iv.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—The Dispersion of the
Jews, and Their Desolate Condition for Rejecting Christ,
Foretold.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>Now, since you join the Jews in
denying that their Christ has come, recollect also what is that end
which they were predicted as about to bring on themselves after the time
of Christ, for the impiety wherewith they both rejected and slew Him.
For it began to come to pass from that day, when, according to Isaiah,
“a man threw away his idols of gold and of silver, which they made into
useless and hurtful objects of worship;” <span
id="fr_3415"></span>[3416](#fn_3415.md) in other words, from the time when
he threw away his idols after the truth had been made clear by Christ.
Consider whether what follows in the prophet has not received its
fulfilment: “The Lord of hosts hath taken away from Judah and from
Jerusalem, amongst other things, both the prophet and the wise
artificer;” <span id="fr_3416"></span>[3417](#fn_3416.md) that is, His Holy
Spirit, who builds the church, which is indeed the temple, and household
and city of God. For thenceforth God’s grace failed amongst them; and
“the clouds were commanded to rain no rain upon the vineyard” of Sorech;
to withhold, that is, the graces of heaven, that they shed no blessing
upon “the house of Israel,” which had but produced “the thorns”
wherewith it had crowned the Lord, and “instead of righteousness, the
cry” wherewith it had hurried Him away to the cross. <span
id="fr_3417"></span>[3418](#fn_3417.md) And so in this manner the law and
the prophets were until John, but the dews of divine grace were
withdrawn from the nation. After his time their madness still continued,
and the name of the Lord was blasphemed by them, as saith the Scripture:
“Because of you my name is continually blasphemed amongst the
nations” <span id="fr_3418"></span>[3419](#fn_3418.md) (for from them did
the blasphemy originate); neither in the interval from Tiberius to
Vespasian did they learn repentance. <span
id="fr_3419"></span>[3420](#fn_3419.md) Therefore “has their land become
desolate, their cities are burnt with fire, their country strangers are
devouring before their own eyes; the daughter of Sion has been deserted
like a cottage in a vineyard, or a lodge in a garden of
cucumbers,” <span id="fr_3420"></span>[3421](#fn_3420.md) ever since the
time when “Israel acknowledged not the Lord, and the people understood
Him not, but forsook Him, and provoked the Holy One of Israel unto
anger.” <span id="fr_3421"></span>[3422](#fn_3421.md) So likewise that
conditional threat of the sword, “If ye refuse and hear me not, the
sword shall devour you,” <span id="fr_3422"></span>[3423](#fn_3422.md) has
proved that it was Christ, for rebellion against whom they have
perished. In the fifty-eighth Psalm He demands of the Father their
dispersion:  “Scatter them in Thy power.” <span
id="fr_3423"></span>[3424](#fn_3423.md) By Isaiah He also says, as He
finishes a prophecy of their consumption by fire: <span
id="fr_3424"></span>[3425](#fn_3424.md) “Because of me has this happened to
you; ye shall lie down in sorrow.” <span
id="fr_3425"></span>[3426](#fn_3425.md) But all this would be unmeaning
enough, if they suffered this retribution not on account of Him, who had
in prophecy assigned their suffering to His own cause, but for the sake
of the Christ of the other god. Well, then, although you affirm that it
is the Christ of the other god who was driven to the cross by the powers
and authorities of the Creator, as it were by hostile beings, still I
have to say, See how manifestly He was defended <span
id="fr_3426"></span>[3427](#fn_3426.md) by the Creator: there were given to
Him both “the wicked for His burial,” even those who had strenuously
maintained that <span id="page_342">p. 342</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.xxiii-Page_342"></span>His corpse had been stolen, “and the
rich for His death,” <span id="fr_3427"></span>[3428](#fn_3427.md) even
those who had redeemed Him from the treachery of Judas, as well as from
the lying report of the soldiers that His body had been taken away.
Therefore these things either did not happen to the Jews on His account,
in which case you will be refuted by the sense of the Scriptures
tallying with the issue of the facts and the order of the times, or else
they did happen on His account, and then the Creator could not have
inflicted the vengeance except for His own Christ; nay, He must have
rather had a reward for Judas, if it had been his master’s enemy whom
they put to death. At all events, <span
id="fr_3428"></span>[3429](#fn_3428.md) if the Creator’s Christ has not
come yet, on whose account the prophecy dooms them to such sufferings,
they will have to endure the sufferings when He shall have come. Then
where will there be a daughter of Sion to be reduced to desolation, for
there is none now to be found? Where will there be cities to be burnt
with fire, for they are now in heaps? <span
id="fr_3429"></span>[3430](#fn_3429.md) Where a nation to be dispersed,
which is already in banishment? Restore to Judæa its former state, that
the Creator’s Christ may find it, and then you may contend that another
Christ has come.  But then, again, <span
id="fr_3430"></span>[3431](#fn_3430.md) how is it that He can have
permitted to range through <span id="fr_3431"></span>[3432](#fn_3431.md)
His own heaven one whom He was some day to put to death on His own
earth, after the more noble and glorious region of His kingdom had been
violated, and His own very palace and sublimest height had been trodden
by him? Or was it only in appearance rather that he did this? <span
id="fr_3432"></span>[3433](#fn_3432.md) God is no doubt <span
id="fr_3433"></span>[3434](#fn_3433.md) a jealous God! Yet he gained the
victory. You should blush with shame, who put your faith in a vanquished
god!  What have you to hope for from him, who was not strong enough to
protect himself? For it was either through his infirmity that he was
crushed by the powers and human agents of the Creator, or else through
maliciousness, in order that he might fasten so great a stigma on them
by his endurance of their wickedness.
