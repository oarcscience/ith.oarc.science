<span id="iv.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Idols Not to Be Made, Much Less
Worshipped. Idols and Idol-Makers in the Same Category.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p2"></span>God prohibits an idol as much to be *made*
as to be *worshipped*. In so far as the *making* what may be worshipped
is the prior act, so far is the prohibition to *make* (if the worship is
unlawful) the prior prohibition. For this cause—the eradicating, namely,
of the material of idolatry—the divine law proclaims, “Thou shalt make
no idol;” <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) and by conjoining,
“Nor a similitude of the things which are in the heaven, and which are
in the earth, and which are in the sea,” has interdicted the servants of
God from acts of that kind all the universe over. Enoch had preceded,
predicting that “the demons, and the spirits of the angelic
apostates, <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) would turn into
idola<span id="page_63">p. 63</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv-Page_63"></span>try all the elements, all the garniture of
the universe, all things contained in the heaven, in the sea, in the
earth, that they might be consecrated as God, in opposition to God.” All
things, therefore, does human error worship, except the Founder of all
Himself.  The images of those things are idols; the consecration of the
images is idolatry. Whatever guilt idolatry incurs, must necessarily be
imputed to every artificer of every idol. In short, the same Enoch
fore-condemns in general menace both idol-worshippers and idol-makers
together. And again:  “I swear to you, sinners, that against the day of
perdition of blood <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) repentance is
being prepared. Ye who serve stones, and ye who make images of gold, and
silver, and wood, and stones and clay, and serve phantoms, and demons,
and spirits in fanes, <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) and all
errors not according to knowledge, shall find no help from them.” But
Isaiah <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) says, “Ye are witnesses
whether there is a God except Me.” “And they who mould and carve out at
that time were not: all vain! who do that which liketh them, which shall
not profit them!” And that whole ensuing discourse sets a ban as well on
the artificers as the worshippers:  the close of which is, “Learn that
their heart is ashes and earth, and that none can free his own soul.” In
which sentence David equally includes the makers too. “Such,” says he,
“let them become who make them.” <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md)
And why should I, a man of limited memory, suggest anything further? Why
recall anything more from the Scriptures? As if either the voice of the
Holy Spirit were not sufficient; or else any further deliberation were
needful, whether the Lord cursed and condemned by priority the
*artificers* of those things, of which He curses and condemns the
*worshippers!*

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p3"></span> [Lev.

It must of course be borne in mind that Tertullian has defined the
meaning of the word *idol* in the former chapter, and speaks with
reference to that definition.

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p5"></span> “Sanguinis perditionis:” such is the
reading of Oehler and others. If it be correct, probably the phrase
“perdition of blood” must be taken as equivalent to “bloody perdition,”
after the Hebrew fashion. Compare, for similar instances, [2 Sam.
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#007.md), [Ps.
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#006.md), [Ps.
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#009.md), [Ps.
55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023.md), [Ezek.
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.iv.iv-p5.1"></span>,
with the marginal readings. But Fr. Junius would read, “Of blood *and*
of perdition”—sanguinis et perditionis. Oehler’s own interpretation of
the reading he gives—“blood-shedding”—appears unsatisfactory.

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p6"></span> “In fanis.” This is Oehler’s reading on
conjecture. Other readings are—infamis, infamibus, insanis, infernis.

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p8"></span> [Ps. cxv.
8](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.iv.iv-p8.1"></span>. In
our version, “They that make them are like unto them.” Tertullian again
agrees with the LXX.
