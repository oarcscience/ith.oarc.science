<p class="c30"><a name="iv.iv.x-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iv.iv.x-p1.1"></A>Chapter X.&#8212;Of Schoolmasters and Their Difficulties.</span></p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="iv.iv.x-p2"></A>Moreover, we must inquire likewise touching schoolmasters; nor only of them, but also all other professors of literature. Nay, on the contrary, we must not doubt that they are in affinity with manifold idolatry: <i>first</i>, in that it is necessary for them to preach the gods of the nations, to express their names, genealogies, honourable distinctions, all and singular; and <i>further</i>, to observe the solemnities and festivals of the same, as of them by whose means they compute their revenues. What schoolmaster, without a table of the seven idols,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">222</FONT></A>
 will yet frequent the Quinquatria? The very first payment of every pupil he consecrates both to the honour and to the name of Minerva; so that, even though he be not said &#8220;to eat of that which is sacrificed to idols&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">223</FONT></A>
 <i>nominally</i> (not being dedicated to any particular idol), he is shunned as an idolater.&#160; What less of defilement does he recur on that ground,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">224</FONT></A>
 than a business brings which, both nominally and virtually, is consecrated publicly to an idol? The Minervalia are as much Minerva&#146;s, as the Saturnalia Saturn&#146;s; Saturn&#146;s, which must necessarily be celebrated even by little slaves at the time of the Saturnalia. New-year&#146;s gifts likewise must be caught at, and the Septimontium kept; and all the presents of Midwinter and the feast of Dear Kinsmanship must be exacted; the schools must be wreathed with flowers; the flamens&#146; wives and the &aelig;diles sacrifice; the school is honoured on the appointed holy-days. The same thing takes place on an idol&#146;s birthday; every pomp of the devil is frequented. Who will think that these things are befitting to a Christian master,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">225</FONT></A>
 unless <i>it be he</i> who shall think them suitable likewise to one who is not a master?&#160; We know it may be said, &#8220;If teaching literature is not lawful to God&#146;s servants, neither will learning be likewise;&#8221; and, &#8220;How could one be trained unto ordinary human intelligence, or unto any sense or action whatever, since literature is the means of training for all life? How do we repudiate secular studies, without which divine studies cannot be pursued?&#8221;&#160; Let us see, then, the necessity of literary erudition; let us reflect that partly it cannot be admitted, partly cannot be avoided. Learning literature is allowable for believers, rather than teaching; for the principle of learning and of teaching is different. If a believer teach literature, while he is teaching doubtless he commends, while he delivers he affirms, while he recalls he bears testimony to, the praises of idols interspersed <A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.x-Page_67"></A>therein. He seals the gods themselves with this name;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">226</FONT></A>
 whereas the Law, as we have said, prohibits &#8220;the names of gods to be pronounced,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">227</FONT></A>
 and this name&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">228</FONT></A>
 to be conferred on vanity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_228"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">229</FONT></A>
 Hence the devil gets men&#146;s early faith built up from the beginnings of their erudition.&#160; Inquire whether he who catechizes about idols commit idolatry. But when a believer <i>learns</i> these things, if he is already capable of understanding what idolatry is, he neither receives nor allows them; much more if he is not yet capable. Or, when he <i>begins</i> to understand, it behoves him first to understand what he has previously learned, that is, touching God and the faith. Therefore he will reject those things, and will not receive them; and will be as safe as one who from one who knows it not, knowingly <i>accepts</i> poison, but does not <i>drink</i> it. To <i>him</i> necessity is attributed as an excuse, because he has no other way to learn. Moreover, the not <i>teaching</i> literature is as much easier than the not <i>learning</i>, as it is easier, too, for the pupil not to attend, than for the master not to frequent, the rest of the defilements incident to the schools from public and scholastic solemnities.</p>
