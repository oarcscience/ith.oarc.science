<span id="v.iv.v.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—The Precept of Loving One’s
Enemies. It is as Much Taught in the Creator’s Scriptures of the Old
Testament as in Christ’s Sermon. The Lex Talionis of Moses Admirably
Explained in Consistency with the Kindness and Love Which Jesus Christ
Came to Proclaim and Enforce in Behalf of the Creator. Sundry Precepts
of Charity Explained.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xvi-p2"></span>“But I say unto you which hear”
(displaying here that old injunction, of the Creator: “Speak to the ears
of those who lend them to you” <span
id="fr_4034"></span>[4035](#fn_4034) .md), “Love your enemies, and
bless <span id="fr_4035"></span>[4036](#fn_4035.md) those which hate you,
and pray for them which calumniate you.” <span
id="fr_4036"></span>[4037](#fn_4036.md) These commands the Creator included
in one precept by His prophet Isaiah: “Say, Ye are our brethren, to
those who hate you.” <span id="fr_4037"></span>[4038](#fn_4037.md) For if
they who are our enemies, and hate us, and speak evil of us, and
calumniate us, are to be called our brethren, surely He did in effect
bid us bless them that hate us, and pray for them who calumniate us,
when He instructed us to reckon them as brethren. Well, but Christ
plainly teaches a new kind of patience, <span
id="fr_4038"></span>[4039](#fn_4038.md) when He actually prohibits the
reprisals which the Creator permitted in requiring “an eye for an
eye, <span id="fr_4039"></span>[4040](#fn_4039.md) and a tooth for a
tooth,” <span id="fr_4040"></span>[4041](#fn_4040.md) and bids us, on the
contrary, “to him who smiteth us on the one cheek, to offer the other
also, and to give up our coat to him that taketh away our cloak.” <span
id="fr_4041"></span>[4042](#fn_4041.md) No doubt these are supplementary
additions by Christ, but they are quite in keeping with the teaching of
the Creator. And therefore this question must at once be
determined, <span id="fr_4042"></span>[4043](#fn_4042.md) Whether the
discipline of patience be enjoined by <span
id="fr_4043"></span>[4044](#fn_4043.md) the Creator? When by Zechariah He
commanded, “Let none of you imagine evil against his *brother*,” <span
id="fr_4044"></span>[4045](#fn_4044.md) He did not expressly include his
*neighbour*; but then in another passage He says, “Let none of you
imagine evil in your hearts against his *neighbour*.” <span
id="fr_4045"></span>[4046](#fn_4045.md) He who counselled that an injury
should be forgotten, was still more likely to counsel the patient
endurance of it. But then, when He said, “Vengeance is mine, and I will
repay,” <span id="fr_4046"></span>[4047](#fn_4046.md) He thereby teaches
that patience calmly waits for the infliction of vengeance. Therefore,
inasmuch as it is incredible <span id="fr_4047"></span>[4048](#fn_4047.md)
that the same (God) should seem to require “a tooth for a tooth and an
eye for an eye,” in return for an injury, who forbids not only all
reprisals, but even a revengeful thought or recollection of an injury,
in so far does it become plain to us in what sense He required “an eye
for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,”—not, indeed, for the purpose of
permitting the repetition of the injury by retaliating it, which it
virtually prohibited when it forbade vengeance; but for the purpose of
restraining the injury in the first instance, which it had forbidden on
pain of retaliation or reciprocity; <span
id="fr_4048"></span>[4049](#fn_4048.md) so that every man, in view of the
permission to inflict a second (or retaliatory) injury, might abstain
from the commission of the first (or provocative) wrong. For He knows
how much more easy it is to repress violence by the prospect of
retaliation, than by the promise of (indefinite) vengeance.  Both
results, however, it was necessary to provide, in consideration of the
nature and the faith of men, that the man who believed in God might
expect vengeance from God, while he who had no faith (to restrain him)
might fear the laws which prescribed retaliation. <span
id="fr_4049"></span>[4050](#fn_4049.md) This purpose <span
id="fr_4050"></span>[4051](#fn_4050.md) of the law, which it was difficult
to understand, Christ, as the Lord of the Sabbath and of the law, and of
all the dispensations of the Father, both revealed and made
intelligible, <span id="fr_4051"></span>[4052](#fn_4051.md) when He
commanded that “the other cheek should be offered (to the smiter),” in
order that He might the more effectually extinguish all reprisals of an
injury, which the law had wished to prevent by the method of
retaliation, (and) which most certainly revelation <span
id="fr_4052"></span>[4053](#fn_4052.md) had manifestly restricted, both by
prohibiting the memory of the wrong, and referring the vengeance thereof
to God.  Thus, whatever (new <span id="page_371">p. 371</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xvi-Page_371"></span>provision) Christ introduced, He did it
not in opposition to the law, but rather in furtherance of it, without
at all impairing the prescription <span
id="fr_4053"></span>[4054](#fn_4053.md) of the Creator. If,
therefore, <span id="fr_4054"></span>[4055](#fn_4054.md) one looks
carefully <span id="fr_4055"></span>[4056](#fn_4055.md) into the very
grounds for which patience is enjoined (and *that* to such a full and
complete extent), one finds that it cannot stand if it is not the
precept of the Creator, who promises vengeance, who presents Himself as
the judge (in the case).  If it were not so, <span
id="fr_4056"></span>[4057](#fn_4056.md) —if so vast a weight of
patience—which is to refrain from giving blow for blow; which is to
offer the other cheek; which is not only not to return railing for
railing, but contrariwise blessing; and which, so far from keeping the
coat, is to give up the cloak also—is laid upon me by one who means not
to help me,—(then all I can say is,) he has taught me patience to no
purpose, <span id="fr_4057"></span>[4058](#fn_4057.md) because he shows me
no reward to his precept—I mean no fruit of such patience. There is
revenge which he ought to have permitted me to take, if he meant not to
inflict it himself; if he did not give me that permission, then he
should himself have inflicted it; <span
id="fr_4058"></span>[4059](#fn_4058.md) since it is for the interest of
discipline itself that an injury should be avenged. For by the fear of
vengeance all iniquity is curbed. But if licence is allowed to it
without discrimination, <span id="fr_4059"></span>[4060](#fn_4059.md) it
will get the mastery—it will put out (a man’s) both eyes; it will knock
out <span id="fr_4060"></span>[4061](#fn_4060.md) every tooth in the safety
of its impunity.  This, however, is (the principle) of your good and
simply beneficent god—to do a wrong to patience, to open the door to
violence, to leave the righteous undefended, and the wicked
unrestrained! “Give to every one that asketh of thee” <span
id="fr_4061"></span>[4062](#fn_4061.md) —to the indigent of course, or
rather to the indigent more especially, although to the affluent
likewise. But in order that no man may be indigent, you have in
Deuteronomy a provision commanded by the Creator to the creditor. <span
id="fr_4062"></span>[4063](#fn_4062.md) “There shall not be in thine hand
an indigent man; so that the Lord thy God shall bless thee with
blessings,” <span id="fr_4063"></span>[4064](#fn_4063.md) —*thee* meaning
the creditor to whom it was owing that the man was not indigent. But
more than this. To one who does not ask, He bids a gift to be given.
“Let there be, not,” He says, “a poor man in thine hand;” in other
words, see that there be not, so far as thy will can prevent; <span
id="fr_4064"></span>[4065](#fn_4064.md) by which command, too, He all the
more strongly by inference requires <span
id="fr_4065"></span>[4066](#fn_4065.md) men to give to him that asks, as in
the following words also: “If there be among you a poor man of thy
brethren, thou shalt not turn away thine heart, nor shut thine hand from
thy poor brother. But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and
shalt surely lend him as much as he wanteth.” <span
id="fr_4066"></span>[4067](#fn_4066.md) Loans are not usually given, except
to such as ask for them. On this subject of lending, <span
id="fr_4067"></span>[4068](#fn_4067.md) however, more hereafter. <span
id="fr_4068"></span>[4069](#fn_4068.md) Now, should any one wish to argue
that the Creator’s precepts extended only to a man’s brethren, but
Christ’s to all that ask, so as to make the latter a new and different
precept, (I have to reply) that one rule only can be made out of those
principles, which show the law of the Creator to be repeated in
Christ. <span id="fr_4069"></span>[4070](#fn_4069.md) For that is not a
different thing which Christ enjoined to be done towards all men, from
that which the Creator prescribed in favour of a man’s brethren.  For
although that is a greater charity, which is shown to strangers, it is
yet not preferable to that <span id="fr_4070"></span>[4071](#fn_4070.md)
which was previously due to one’s neighbours.  For what man will be able
to bestow the love (which proceeds from knowledge of character, <span
id="fr_4071"></span>[4072](#fn_4071.md) upon strangers? Since, however, the
second step <span id="fr_4072"></span>[4073](#fn_4072.md) in charity is
towards strangers, while the first is towards one’s neighbours, the
second step will belong to him to whom the first also belongs, more
fitly than the second will belong to him who owned no first. <span
id="fr_4073"></span>[4074](#fn_4073.md) Accordingly, the Creator, when
following the course of nature, taught in the first instance kindness to
*neighbours*, <span id="fr_4074"></span>[4075](#fn_4074.md) intending
afterwards to enjoin it towards *strangers*; and when following the
method of His dispensation, He limited charity first to the Jews, but
afterwards extended it to the whole race of mankind. So long, therefore,
as the mystery *of His government* <span
id="fr_4075"></span>[4076](#fn_4075.md) was confined to Israel, He properly
commanded that pity should be shown only to a man’s brethren; but when
Christ had given to Him “the Gentiles for His heritage, and the ends of
the earth for His possession,” then began to be accomplished what was
said by Hosea: “Ye are not my people, who were my people; ye have not
obtained mercy, who <span id="page_372">p. 372</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xvi-Page_372"></span>once obtained mercy” <span
id="fr_4076"></span>[4077](#fn_4076) —that is, the (Jewish.md) nation.
Thenceforth Christ extended to all men the law of His Father’s
compassion, excepting none from His mercy, as He omitted none in His
invitation. So that, whatever was the ampler scope of His teaching, He
received it all in His heritage of the nations. “And as ye would that
men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.” <span
id="fr_4077"></span>[4078](#fn_4077.md) In this command is no doubt implied
its counterpart: “And as ye would *not* that men should do to you, so
should ye also *not* do to them likewise.” Now, if this were the
teaching of the new and previously unknown and not yet fully proclaimed
deity, who had favoured me with no instruction beforehand, whereby I
might first learn what I ought to choose or to refuse for myself, and to
do to others what I would wish done to myself, not doing to them what I
should be unwilling to have done to myself, it would certainly be
nothing else than the chance-medley of my own sentiments <span
id="fr_4078"></span>[4079](#fn_4078.md) which he would have left to me,
binding me to no proper rule of wish or action, in order that I might do
to others what I would like for myself, or refrain from doing to others
what I should dislike to have done to myself. For he has not, in fact,
defined what I ought to wish or not to wish for myself as well as for
others, so that I shape my conduct <span
id="fr_4079"></span>[4080](#fn_4079.md) according to the law of my own
will, and have it in my power <span id="fr_4080"></span>[4081](#fn_4080.md)
not to render <span id="fr_4081"></span>[4082](#fn_4081.md) to another what
I would like to have rendered to myself—love, obedience, consolation,
protection, and such like blessings; and in like manner to do to another
what I should be unwilling to have done to myself—violence, wrong,
insult, deceit, and evils of like sort.  Indeed, the heathen who have
not been instructed by God act on this incongruous liberty of the will
and the conduct. <span id="fr_4082"></span>[4083](#fn_4082.md) For although
good and evil are severally known by nature, yet life is not thereby
spent <span id="fr_4083"></span>[4084](#fn_4083.md) under the discipline of
God, which alone at last teaches men the proper liberty of their will
and action in faith, as in the fear of God. The god of Marcion,
therefore, although specially revealed, was, in spite of his revelation,
unable to publish any summary of the precept in question, which had
hitherto been so confined, <span id="fr_4084"></span>[4085](#fn_4084.md)
and obscure, and dark, and admitting of no ready interpretation, except
according to my own arbitrary thought, <span
id="fr_4085"></span>[4086](#fn_4085.md) because he had provided no previous
discrimination in the matter of such a precept. This, however, was not
the case with my God, for <span id="fr_4086"></span>[4087](#fn_4086.md) He
always and everywhere enjoined that the poor, and the orphan, and the
widow should be protected, assisted, refreshed; thus by Isaiah He says:
“Deal thy bread to the hungry, and them that are houseless bring into
thine house; when thou seest the naked, cover him.” <span
id="fr_4087"></span>[4088](#fn_4087.md) By Ezekiel also He thus describes
the just man: “His bread will he give to the hungry, and the naked will
he cover with a garment.” <span id="fr_4088"></span>[4089](#fn_4088.md)
That teaching was even then a sufficient inducement to me to do to
others what I would that they should do unto me. Accordingly, when He
uttered such denunciations as, “Thou shalt do no murder; thou shalt not
commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false
witness,” <span id="fr_4089"></span>[4090](#fn_4089.md) —He taught me to
refrain from doing to others what I should be unwilling to have done to
myself; and therefore the precept developed in the Gospel will belong to
Him alone, who anciently drew it up, and gave it distinctive point, and
arranged it after the decision of His own teaching, and has now reduced
it, suitably to its importance, <span
id="fr_4090"></span>[4091](#fn_4090.md) to a compendious formula, because
(as it was predicted in another passage) the Lord—that is, Christ—“was
to make (or utter) a concise word on earth.” <span
id="fr_4091"></span>[4092](#fn_4091.md)

<span id="v.iv.v.xvi-p38"></span> This obscure passage runs thus: “Immo
unum erit ex his per quæ lex Creatoris erit in Christo.”

<span id="v.iv.v.xvi-p40"></span> This is the idea, apparently, of
Tertullian’s question: “Quis enim poterit *diligere* extraneos?” But a
different turn is given to the sense in the older reading of the
passage: Quis enim non diligens proximos poterit diligere extraneos?
“For who that loveth not his neighbours will be able to love strangers?”
The inserted words, however, were inserted conjecturally by Fulvius
Ursinus without <span class="sc"><span
