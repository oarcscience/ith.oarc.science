<span id="iv.iii.xl-p2"></span>On the contrary, *they* deserve the name
of faction who conspire to bring odium on good men and virtuous, who cry
out against innocent blood, offering as the justification of their
enmity the baseless plea, that they think the Christians the cause of
every public disaster, of every affliction with which the people are
visited.  If the Tiber rises as high as the city walls, if the Nile does
not send its waters up over the fields, if the heavens give no rain, if
there is an earthquake, if there is famine or pestilence, straightway
the cry <span id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) is, “Away with the
Christians to the lion!”  What! shall you give such multitudes to a
single beast? Pray, tell me how many calamities befell the world and
particular cities before Tiberius reigned—before the coming, that is, of
Christ? We read of the islands of Hiera, and Anaphe, and Delos, and
Rhodes, and Cos, with many thousands of human beings, having been
swallowed up. Plato informs us that a region larger than Asia or Africa
was seized by the Atlantic Ocean. An earthquake, too, drank up the
Corinthian sea; and the force of the waves cut off a part of Lucania,
whence it obtained the name of Sicily. These things surely could not
have taken place without the inhabitants suffering by them. But where—I
do not say were Christians, those despisers of your gods—but where were
your gods themselves in those days, when the flood poured its destroying
waters over all the world, or, as Plato thought, merely the level
portion of it?  For that they are of later date <span id="page_48">p.
48</span> <span id="iv.iii.xl-Page_48"></span>than that calamity, the
very cities in which they were born and died, nay, which they founded,
bear ample testimony; for the cities could have no existence at this day
unless as belonging to postdiluvian times.  Palestine had not yet
received from Egypt its Jewish swarm (of emigrants), nor had the race
from which Christians sprung yet settled down there, when its neighbors
Sodom and Gomorrah were consumed by fire from heaven. The country yet
smells of that conflagration; and if there are apples there upon the
trees, it is only a promise to the eye they give—you but touch them, and
they turn to ashes. Nor had Tuscia and Campania to complain of
Christians in the days when fire from heaven overwhelmed Vulsinii, and
Pompeii was destroyed by fire from its own mountain.  No one yet
worshipped the true God at Rome, when Hannibal at Cannæ counted the
Roman slain by the pecks of Roman rings. Your gods were all objects of
adoration, universally acknowledged, when the Senones closely besieged
the very Capitol. And it is in keeping with all this, that if adversity
has at any time befallen cities, the temples and the walls have equally
shared in the disaster, so that it is clear to demonstration the thing
was not the doing of the gods, seeing it also overtook themselves. The
truth is, the human race has always deserved ill at God’s hand.  First
of all, as undutiful to Him, because when it knew Him in part, it not
only did not seek after Him, but even invented other gods of its own to
worship; and further, because, as the result of their willing ignorance
of the Teacher of righteousness, the Judge and Avenger of sin, all vices
and crimes grew and flourished. But had men sought, they would have come
to know the glorious object of their seeking; and knowledge would have
produced obedience, and obedience would have found a gracious instead of
an angry God. They ought then to see that the very same God is angry
with them now as in ancient times, before Christians were so much as
spoken of. It was *His* blessings they enjoyed—created before they made
any of their deities: and why can they not take it in, that their evils
come from the Being whose goodness they have failed to recognize? They
suffer at the hands of Him to whom they have been ungrateful. And, for
all that is said, if we compare the calamities of former times, they
fall on us more lightly now, since God gave Christians to the world; for
from that time virtue put some restraint on the world’s wickedness, and
men began to pray for the averting of God’s wrath. In a word, when the
summer clouds give no rain, and the season is matter of anxiety, you
indeed—full of feasting day by day, and ever eager for the banquet,
baths and taverns and brothels always busy—offer up to Jupiter your
rain-sacrifices; you enjoin on the people barefoot processions; you seek
heaven at the Capitol; you look up to the temple-ceilings for the
longed-for clouds—God and heaven not in all your thoughts. We, dried up
with fastings, and our passions bound tightly up, holding back as long
as possible from all the ordinary enjoyments of life, rolling in
sackcloth and ashes, assail heaven with our importunities—touch God’s
heart—and when we have extorted divine compassion, why, Jupiter gets all
the honour!
