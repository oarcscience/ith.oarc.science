id="iv.ix.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Further Proofs from the Calling
of the Gentiles.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.xii-p2"></span>Look at the universal nations thenceforth
emerging from the vortex of human error to the Lord God the Creator and
His Christ; and if you dare to deny that this was prophesied, forthwith
occurs to you the promise of the Father in the Psalms, which says, “My
Son art Thou; to-day have I begotten Thee.  Ask of Me, and I will give
Thee Gentiles *as* Thine heritage, and *as* Thy possession *the* bounds
of the earth.” <span id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md) For you will
not be able to affirm that “son” to be David rather than Christ; or the
“bounds of the earth” to have been promised rather to David, who reigned
within the single (country of) Judea, than to Christ, who has already
taken captive the whole orb with the faith of His gospel; as He says
through Isaiah:  “Behold, I have given Thee for a covenant <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379.md) of my family, for a light of
Gentiles, that Thou mayst open the eyes of the blind”—of course, such as
err—“to outloose from bonds the bound”—that is, to free them from
sins—“and from the house of prison”—that is, of death—“such as sit in
darkness” <span id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380.md) —of ignorance, to
wit. And if these blessings accrue through Christ, they will not have
been prophesied of another than Him through whom we consider them to
have been accomplished. <span id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381.md)
