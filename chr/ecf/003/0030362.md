<span id="v.iv.iii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Some of God’s Laws
Defended as Good, Which the Marcionites Impeached, Such as the Lex
Talionis. Useful Purposes in a Social and Moral Point of View of This,
and Sundry Other Enactments.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xviii-p2"></span>But what parts of the law can I
defend as good with a greater confidence than those which heresy has
shown such a longing for?—as the statute of retaliation, requiring eye
for eye, tooth for tooth, and stripe for stripe. <span
id="fr_2911"></span>[2912](#fn_2911) Now there is not here any smack of
a permission to mutual injury; but rather, on the whole, a provision for
restraining violence. To a people which was very obdurate, and wanting
in faith towards God, it might seem tedious, and even incredible, to
expect from God that vengeance which was subsequently to be declared by
the prophet: “Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_2912"></span>[2913](#fn_2912) Therefore, in the meanwhile, the
commission of wrong was to be checked <span
id="fr_2913"></span>[2914](#fn_2913) by the fear of a retribution
immediately to happen; and so the permission of this retribution was to
be the prohibition of provocation, that a stop might thus be put to all
hot-blooded <span id="fr_2914"></span>[2915](#fn_2914) injury, whilst by
the permission of the second the first is prevented by fear, and by this
deterring of the first the second fails to be committed. By the same law
another result is also obtained, <span
id="fr_2915"></span>[2916](#fn_2915) even the more ready kindling of the
fear of retaliation by reason of the very savour of passion which is in
it. There is no more bitter thing, than to endure the very suffering
which you have inflicted upon others. When, again, the law took somewhat
away from men’s food, by pronouncing unclean certain animals which were
once blessed, you should understand this to be a measure for encouraging
continence, and recognise in it a bridle imposed on that appetite which,
while eating angels’ food, craved after the cucumbers and melons of the
Egyptians. Recognise also therein a precaution against those companions
of the appetite, even lust and luxury, which are usually chilled by the
chastening of the appetite. <span id="fr_2916"></span>[2917](#fn_2916)
For “the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to
play.” <span id="fr_2917"></span>[2918](#fn_2917) Furthermore, that an
eager wish for money might be restrained, so far as it is caused by the
need of food, the desire for costly meat and drink was taken out of
their power. Lastly, in order that man might be more readily educated by
God for fasting, he was accustomed to such articles of food as were
neither plentiful nor sumptuous, and not likely to pamper the appetite
of the luxurious. Of course the Creator deserved all the greater blame,
because it was from His own people that He took away food, rather than
from the more ungrateful Marcionites. As for the burdensome sacrifices
also, and the troublesome scrupulousness of their ceremonies <span
id="fr_2918"></span>[2919](#fn_2918) and oblations, no one should blame
them, as if God specially required them for Himself: for He plainly
asks, “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?”
and, <span id="page_312">p. 312</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.xviii-Page_312"></span>“Who hath required them at your
hand?” <span id="fr_2919"></span>[2920](#fn_2919) But he should see
herein a careful provision <span id="fr_2920"></span>[2921](#fn_2920) on
God’s part, which showed His wish to bind to His own religion a people
who were prone to idolatry and transgression by that kind of services
wherein consisted the superstition of that period; that He might call
them away therefrom, while requesting it to be performed to Himself, as
if He desired that no sin should be committed in making idols.
