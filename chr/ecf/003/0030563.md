<span id="v.vii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Apelles and His Followers,
Displeased with Our Earthly Bodies, Attributed to Christ a Body of a
Purer Sort. How Christ Was Heavenly Even in His Earthly Flesh.</span>

<span id="v.vii.viii-p2"></span>These passages alone, in which Apelles
and Marcion seem to place their chief reliance when interpreted
according to the truth of the entire uncorrupted gospel, ought to have
been sufficient for proving the human flesh of Christ by a defence of
His birth. But since Apelles’ precious set <span
id="fr_7055"></span>[7056](#fn_7055) lay a very great stress on the
shameful condition <span id="fr_7056"></span>[7057](#fn_7056) of the
flesh, which they will have to have been furnished with souls tampered
with by the fiery author of evil, <span
id="fr_7057"></span>[7058](#fn_7057) and so unworthy of Christ; and
because they on that account suppose that a sidereal substance is
suitable for Him, I am bound to refute them on their own ground. They
mention a certain angel of great renown as having created this world of
ours, and as having, after the creation, repented of his work. This
indeed we have treated of in a passage by itself; for we have written a
little work in opposition to them, *on the question* whether one who had
the spirit, and will, and power of Christ for such operations, could
have done anything which required repentance, since they describe the
*said* angel by the figure of “the lost sheep.” The world, then, must be
a wrong thing, <span id="fr_7058"></span>[7059](#fn_7058) according to
the evidence of its Creator’s repentance; for all repentance is the
admission of fault, nor has it indeed any existence except through
fault. Now, if the world <span id="fr_7059"></span>[7060](#fn_7059) is a
fault, as is the body, such must be its parts—faulty too; so in like
manner must be the heaven and its celestial (contents), and everything
which is conceived and produced out of it. And “a corrupt tree must
needs bring forth evil fruit.” <span
id="fr_7060"></span>[7061](#fn_7060) The flesh of Christ, therefore, if
composed of celestial elements, consists of faulty materials, sinful by
reason of its sinful origin; <span id="fr_7061"></span>[7062](#fn_7061)
so that it must be a part of that substance which they disdain to clothe
Christ with, because of its sinfulness,—in other words, our own. Then,
as there is no difference in the point of ignominy, let them either
devise for Christ some substance of a purer stamp, since they are
displeased with our own, or else let them recognise this too, than which
even a heavenly substance could not have been better. We read in so many
words: <span id="fr_7062"></span>[7063](#fn_7062) “The first man is of
the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.” <span
id="fr_7063"></span>[7064](#fn_7063) This passage, however, has nothing
to do with any difference of substance; it only contrasts with the
once <span id="fr_7064"></span>[7065](#fn_7064) “earthy” substance of
the flesh of the first man, Adam, the “heavenly” substance of the spirit
of the second man, Christ. And so entirely does the passage refer the
celestial man to the spirit and not to the flesh, that those whom it
compares to Him evidently become celestial—by the Spirit, of course—even
in this “earthy flesh.” Now, since Christ is heavenly even in regard to
the flesh, they could not be compared to Him, who are not heavenly in
reference to their flesh. <span id="fr_7065"></span>[7066](#fn_7065) If,
then, they who become heavenly, as Christ also was, carry about an
“earthy” substance of flesh, the conclusion which is affirmed by this
fact is, that Christ Himself also was heavenly, but in an “earthy”
flesh, even as they are who are put on a level with Him. <span
