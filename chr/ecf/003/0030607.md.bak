<span id="v.viii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—St. John, in the Apocalypse,
Equally Explicit in Asserting the Same Great Doctrine.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxv-p2"></span>In the Revelation of John, again, the
order of these times is spread out to view, which “the souls of the
martyrs” are taught to wait for beneath the altar, whilst they earnestly
pray to be avenged and judged: <span
id="fr_7454"></span>[7455](#fn_7454) (taught, I say, to wait.md), in order
that the world may first drink to the dregs the plagues that await it
out of the vials of the angels, <span
id="fr_7455"></span>[7456](#fn_7455.md) and that the city of fornication
may receive from the ten kings its deserved doom, <span
id="fr_7456"></span>[7457](#fn_7456.md) and that the beast Antichrist with
his false prophet may wage war on the Church of God; and that, after the
casting of the devil into the bottomless pit for a while, <span
id="fr_7457"></span>[7458](#fn_7457.md) the blessed prerogative of the
first resurrection may be ordained from the thrones; <span
id="fr_7458"></span>[7459](#fn_7458.md) and then again, after the
consignment of him to the fire, that the judgment of the final and
universal resurrection may be determined out of the books. <span
id="fr_7459"></span>[7460](#fn_7459.md) Since, then, the Scriptures both
indicate the stages of the last times, and concentrate the harvest of
the Christian hope in the very end of the world, it is evident, either
that all which God promises to us receives its accomplishment then, and
thus what the heretics pretend about a resurrection here falls to the
ground; or else, even allowing that a confession of the mystery (of
divine truth) is a resurrection, that there is, without any detriment to
this view, room for believing in that which is announced for the end. It
moreover follows, that the very maintenance of this spiritual
resurrection amounts to a presumption in favour of the other bodily
resurrection; for if none were announced for that time, there would be
fair ground for asserting only this purely spiritual resurrection.
Inasmuch, however, as (a resurrection) is proclaimed for the last time,
it is proved to be a bodily one, because there is no spiritual one also
then announced. For why make a second announcement of a resurrection of
only one character, that is, the spiritual one, since this ought to be
undergoing accomplishment either now, without any regard to different
times, or else then, at the very conclusion of all the periods? It is
therefore more competent for us even to maintain a spiritual
resurrection at the commencement of *a life of* faith, who acknowledge
the full completion thereof at the end of the world.
