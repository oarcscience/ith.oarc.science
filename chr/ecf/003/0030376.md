<span id="v.iv.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Why Christ’s Coming Should Be
Previously Announced.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.ii-p2"></span>Coming then at once to the point, <span
id="fr_3102"></span>[3103](#fn_3102.md) I have to encounter the question,
Whether Christ ought to have come so suddenly? <span
id="fr_3103"></span>[3104](#fn_3103) (I answer, No..md) First, because He
was the Son of God His Father. For this was a point of order, that the
Father should announce <span id="fr_3104"></span>[3105](#fn_3104.md) the
Son before the Son should the Father, and that the Father should testify
of the Son before the Son should testify of the Father. Secondly,
because, in addition to the title of Son, He was the Sent. The
authority, <span id="fr_3105"></span>[3106](#fn_3105.md) therefore, of the
Sender must needs have first appeared <span id="page_322">p. 322</span>
<span id="v.iv.iv.ii-Page_322"></span>in a testimony of the Sent;
because none who comes in the authority of another does himself set it
forth <span id="fr_3106"></span>[3107](#fn_3106.md) for himself on his own
assertion, but rather looks out for protection from it, for first comes
the support <span id="fr_3107"></span>[3108](#fn_3107.md) of him who gives
him his authority. Now (Christ) will neither be acknowledged as Son if
the Father never named Him, nor be believed in as the Sent One if no
Sender <span id="fr_3108"></span>[3109](#fn_3108.md) gave Him a commission:
the Father, if any, purposely naming Him; and the Sender, if any,
purposely commissioning Him. Everything will be open to suspicion which
transgresses a rule. Now the primary order of all things will not allow
that the Father should come after the Son in recognition, or the Sender
after the Sent, or God after Christ. Nothing can take precedence of its
own original in being acknowledged, nor in like manner can it in its
ordering. <span id="fr_3109"></span>[3110](#fn_3109.md) Suddenly a Son,
suddenly Sent, and suddenly Christ! On the contrary, I should suppose
that from God nothing comes suddenly, because there is nothing which is
not ordered and arranged by God. And if ordered, why not also foretold,
that it may be proved to have been ordered by the prediction, and by the
ordering to be divine? And indeed so great a work, which (we may be
sure) required preparation, <span id="fr_3110"></span>[3111](#fn_3110.md)
as being for the salvation of man, could not have been on that very
account a sudden thing, because it was through faith that it was to be
of avail. <span id="fr_3111"></span>[3112](#fn_3111.md) Inasmuch, then, as
it had to be believed in order to be of use, so far did it require, for
the securing of this faith, a preparation built upon the foundations of
pro-arrangement and fore-announcement. Faith, when informed by such a
process, might justly be required <span
id="fr_3112"></span>[3113](#fn_3112.md) of man by God, and by man be
reposed in God; it being a duty, after that knowledge <span
id="fr_3113"></span>[3114](#fn_3113.md) has made it a possibility, to
believe those things which a man had learned indeed to believe from the
fore-announcement. <span id="fr_3114"></span>[3115](#fn_3114.md)
