<p class="c19"><a name="v.iv.v.xli-p2"></A>&#8220;Woe,&#8221; says He, &#8220;to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5093"></A><A HREF="#fn_5093"><FONT SIZE="1">5094</FONT></A>
 Now it is certain that in this <i>woe</i> must be understood the imprecation and threat of an angry and incensed Master, unless Judas was to escape with impunity after so vast a sin. If he were meant to escape with impunity, the <i>&#8220;woe&#8221;</i> was an idle word; if not, he was of course to be punished by Him against whom he had committed the sin of treachery.&#160; Now, if He knowingly permitted the man, whom He&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5094"></A><A HREF="#fn_5094"><FONT SIZE="1">5095</FONT></A>
 deliberately elected to be one of His companions, to plunge into so great a crime, you must no longer use an argument against the Creator in Adam&#146;s case, which may now recoil on your own God:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5095"></A><A HREF="#fn_5095"><FONT SIZE="1">5096</FONT></A>
 either that he was <i>ignorant</i>, and had no foresight to hinder the future sinner;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5096"></A><A HREF="#fn_5096"><FONT SIZE="1">5097</FONT></A>
 or that he was <i>unable</i> to hinder him, even if he was ignorant;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5097"></A><A HREF="#fn_5097"><FONT SIZE="1">5098</FONT></A>
 or else that he was <i>unwilling</i>, even if he had the foreknowledge and the ability; and so deserved the stigma of maliciousness, in having permitted the man of his own choice to perish in his sin. I advise you therefore (willingly) to acknowledge the Creator in that god of yours, rather than against your will to be assimilating your excellent god to Him.&#160; For in the case of Peter,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5098"></A><A HREF="#fn_5098"><FONT SIZE="1">5099</FONT></A>
 too, he gives you proof that he is a jealous God, when he destined the apostle, after his presumptuous protestations of zeal, to a flat denial of him, rather than <i>prevent his fall</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5099"></A><A HREF="#fn_5099"><FONT SIZE="1">5100</FONT></A>
 The Christ of the prophets was destined, moreover, to be betrayed with a kiss,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5100"></A><A HREF="#fn_5100"><FONT SIZE="1">5101</FONT></A>
 for He was the Son indeed of Him who was &#8220;honoured <i>with the lips</i>&#8221; by the people.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5101"></A><A HREF="#fn_5101"><FONT SIZE="1">5102</FONT></A>
 When led before the council, He is asked whether He is the Christ.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5102"></A><A HREF="#fn_5102"><FONT SIZE="1">5103</FONT></A>
 Of what Christ could the Jews have inquired&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5103"></A><A HREF="#fn_5103"><FONT SIZE="1">5104</FONT></A>
 but their own? Why, therefore, did He not, even at that moment, declare to them the rival (Christ)? You reply, In order that He might be able to suffer. In other words, that this most excellent god might plunge men into crime, whom he was still keeping in ignorance. But even if he had told them, he would yet have to suffer. For he said, &#8220;If I tell you, ye will not believe.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5104"></A><A HREF="#fn_5104"><FONT SIZE="1">5105</FONT></A>
 And refusing to believe, they would have continued to insist on his death. And would he not even more probably still have had to suffer, if had announced himself as sent by the rival god, and as being, therefore, the enemy of the Creator? It was not, then, in order that He might suffer, that He at that critical moment refrained from proclaiming&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5105"></A><A HREF="#fn_5105"><FONT SIZE="1">5106</FONT></A>
 Himself the other <i>Christ</i>, but because they wanted to extort a confession from His mouth, which they did not mean to believe even if He had given it to them, whereas it was their bounden duty to have acknowledged Him in consequence of His works, which were fulfilling their Scriptures. It was thus plainly His course to keep Himself at that moment unrevealed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5106"></A><A HREF="#fn_5106"><FONT SIZE="1">5107</FONT></A>
 because a spontaneous recognition was due to Him. But yet for all this, He with a solemn gesture&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5107"></A><A HREF="#fn_5107"><FONT SIZE="1">5108</FONT></A>
 says, &#8220;Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5108"></A><A HREF="#fn_5108"><FONT SIZE="1">5109</FONT></A>
 For it was on the authority of the prophecy of Daniel that He intimated to them that He was &#8220;the Son of man,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5109"></A><A HREF="#fn_5109"><FONT SIZE="1">5110</FONT></A>
 and of David&#146;s Psalm, that He would &#8220;sit at the right hand of God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5110"></A><A HREF="#fn_5110"><FONT SIZE="1">5111</FONT></A>
 Accordingly, after He had said this, and so suggested a comparison of the Scripture, a ray of light did seem to show them whom He would have them understand Him to be; for they say: &#8220;Art thou then the Son of God?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5111"></A><A HREF="#fn_5111"><FONT SIZE="1">5112</FONT></A>
 Of what God, but of Him whom alone they knew? Of what God but of Him whom they remembered in the Psalm as having said to <A NAME="page_420"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 420</FONT></A> <a name="v.iv.v.xli-Page_420"></A>His Son, &#8220;Sit Thou on my right hand?&#8221; Then He answered, &#8220;Ye say that I am;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5112"></A><A HREF="#fn_5112"><FONT SIZE="1">5113</FONT></A>
 as if He meant: It is <i>ye</i> who say this&#8212;not I. But at the same time He allowed Himself to be all that they had said, in this their second question.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5113"></A><A HREF="#fn_5113"><FONT SIZE="1">5114</FONT></A>
 By what means, however, are you going to prove to us that they pronounced the sentence &#8220;<i>Ergo tu filius Dei es</i>&#8221; interrogatively, and not affirmatively?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5114"></A><A HREF="#fn_5114"><FONT SIZE="1">5115</FONT></A>
 Just as, (on the one hand,) because He had shown them in an indirect manner,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5115"></A><A HREF="#fn_5115"><FONT SIZE="1">5116</FONT></A>
 by passages of Scripture, that they ought to regard Him as the Son of God, they therefore meant their own words, &#8220;Thou art then the Son of God,&#8221; to be taken in a like (indirect) sense,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5116"></A><A HREF="#fn_5116"><FONT SIZE="1">5117</FONT></A>
 as much as to say, &#8220;You do not wish to say this of yourself plainly,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5117"></A><A HREF="#fn_5117"><FONT SIZE="1">5118</FONT></A>
 so, (on the other hand,) He likewise answered them, &#8220;Ye say that I am,&#8221; in a sense equally free from doubt, even affirmatively;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5118"></A><A HREF="#fn_5118"><FONT SIZE="1">5119</FONT></A>
 and so completely was His statement to this effect, that they insisted on accepting that sense which His statement indicated.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5119"></A><A HREF="#fn_5119"><FONT SIZE="1">5120</FONT></A>
