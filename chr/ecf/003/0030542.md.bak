<span id="v.vi.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—The Christ of the Demiurge,
Sent into the World by the Virgin. Not of Her. He Found in Her, Not a
Mother, But Only a Passage or Channel. Jesus Descended Upon Christ, at
His Baptism, Like a Dove; But, Being Incapable of Suffering, He Left
Christ to Die on the Cross Alone.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxvii-p2"></span>I now adduce <span
id="fr_6855"></span>[6856](#fn_6855) (what they say.md) concerning Christ,
upon whom some of them engraft Jesus with so much licence, that they
foist into Him a spiritual seed together with an animal *inflatus*.
Indeed, I will not undertake to describe <span
id="fr_6856"></span>[6857](#fn_6856.md) these incongruous crammings, <span
id="fr_6857"></span>[6858](#fn_6857.md) which they have contrived in
relation both to their men and their gods. Even the Demiurge has a
Christ of His own—His natural Son. An animal, in short, produced by
Himself, proclaimed by the prophets—His position being one which must be
decided by prepositions; in other words, He was produced *by means of* a
virgin, rather than *of* a virgin! On the ground that, having descended
into the virgin rather in the manner of a passage through her than of a
birth by her, He came into existence *through* her, not *of* her—not
experiencing a mother in her, but nothing more than a way. Upon this
same Christ, therefore (so they say), Jesus descended in the sacrament
of baptism, in the likeness of a dove.  Moreover, there was even in
Christ accruing from Achamoth the condiment of a spiritual seed, in
order of course to prevent the corruption of all the other
stuffing. <span id="fr_6858"></span>[6859](#fn_6858.md) For after the
precedent of the principal Tetrad, they guard him with four
substances—the spiritual one of Achamoth, the animal one of the
Demiurge, the corporeal one, which cannot be described, and that of
Soter, or, in other phrase, the columbine. <span
id="fr_6859"></span>[6860](#fn_6859) As for Soter (*Jesus*.md), he remained
in Christ to the last, impassible, incapable of injury, incapable of
apprehension. By and by, when it came to a question of capture, he
departed from him during the examination before Pilate. In like manner,
his mother’s seed did not admit of being injured, being equally exempt
from all manner of outrage, <span id="fr_6860"></span>[6861](#fn_6860.md)
and being undiscovered even by the Demiurge himself. The animal and
carnal Christ, however, does suffer after the fashion <span
id="fr_6861"></span>[6862](#fn_6861.md) of the superior Christ, who, for
the purpose of producing Achamoth, had been stretched upon the cross,
that is, Horos, in a substantial though not a cognizable <span
id="fr_6862"></span>[6863](#fn_6862.md) form. In this manner do they reduce
all things to mere images—Christians themselves being indeed nothing but
imaginary beings!
