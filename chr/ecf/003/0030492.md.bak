<span id="v.v.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Hermogenes Pursued to Another
Passage of Scripture. The Absurdity of His Interpretation
Exposed.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p2"></span>But he draws an argument from the
following words, where it is written:  “And the earth was without form,
and void.” <span id="fr_6348"></span>[6349](#fn_6348.md) For he
resolves <span id="fr_6349"></span>[6350](#fn_6349.md) the word *earth*
into Matter, because that which is made out of it is the earth.  And to
the word *was* he gives the same direction, as if it pointed to what had
always existed unbegotten and unmade. It was *without form*, moreover,
*and* void, because he will have Matter to have existed shapeless and
confused, and without the finish of a maker’s hand. <span
id="fr_6350"></span>[6351](#fn_6350.md) Now these opinions of his I will
refute singly; but first I wish to say to him, by way of general answer:
We are of opinion that Matter is pointed at in these terms. But yet does
the Scripture intimate that, because Matter was in existence before all,
anything of *like* condition <span id="fr_6351"></span>[6352](#fn_6351.md)
was even formed out of it? Nothing of the kind. Matter might have had
existence, if it so pleased—or rather if Hermogenes so pleased. It
might, I say, have existed, and yet God might not have made anything out
of it, either as it was unsuitable to Him to have required the aid of
anything, or at least because He is not shown to have made anything out
of Matter. Its existence must therefore be without a cause, you will
say. Oh, no! certainly <span id="fr_6352"></span>[6353](#fn_6352.md) not
without cause. For even if the world were not made out of it, yet a
heresy has been hatched there from; and a specially impudent one too,
because it is not Matter which has produced the heresy, but the heresy
has rather made Matter itself.
