<span id="v.ix.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—A Brief Reference to the
Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. Their Agreement with St. John, in
Respect to the Distinct Personality of the Father and the Son.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xxvi-p2"></span>In addition to Philip’s conversation, and
<span id="page_622">p. 622</span> <span
id="v.ix.xxvi-Page_622"></span>the Lord’s reply to it, the reader will
observe that we have run through John’s Gospel *to show* that many other
passages of a clear purport, both before and after that chapter, are
only in strict accord with that single and prominent statement, which
must be interpreted agreeably to all other places, rather than in
opposition to them, and indeed to its own inherent and natural sense. I
will not here largely use the support of the other Gospels, which
confirm our belief by the Lord’s *nativity*: it is sufficient to remark
that He who had to be born of a virgin is announced in express terms by
the angel himself as the Son of God: “The Spirit of God shall come upon
thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also
the Holy Thing that shall be born of thee shall be called *the Son of
God*.” <span id="fr_8124"></span>[8125](#fn_8124.md) On this passage even
they will wish to raise a cavil; but truth will prevail. Of course, they
say, the Son of God is God, and the power of the highest is the Most
High. And they do not hesitate to insinuate <span
id="fr_8125"></span>[8126](#fn_8125.md) what, if it had been true, would
have been written. Whom was he <span
id="fr_8126"></span>[8127](#fn_8126.md) so afraid of as not plainly to
declare, “God shall come upon thee, and the Highest shall overshadow
thee?” Now, by saying “the Spirit of God” (although the Spirit of God
*is God*,) and by not directly naming God, he wished that portion <span
id="fr_8127"></span>[8128](#fn_8127.md) of the whole *Godhead* to be
understood, which was about to retire into the designation of “the Son.”
The Spirit of God in this passage must be the same *as the* Word. For
just as, when John says, “The Word was made flesh,” <span
id="fr_8128"></span>[8129](#fn_8128.md) we understand the Spirit also in
the mention of the Word: so here, too, we acknowledge the Word likewise
in the name of the Spirit. For both the Spirit is the substance of the
Word, and the Word is the operation of the Spirit, and the Two are One
(and the same). <span id="fr_8129"></span>[8130](#fn_8129.md) Now John must
mean *One* when he speaks of Him as “having been made flesh,” and the
angel *Another* when he announces Him as “about to be born,” if the
Spirit is not the Word, and the Word the Spirit. For just as the Word of
God is not actually He whose *Word* He is, so also the Spirit (although
He is called God) is not actually He whose *Spirit* He is said to be.
Nothing which belongs to something else is actually the very same thing
as that to which it belongs. Clearly, when anything proceeds from a
personal subject, <span id="fr_8130"></span>[8131](#fn_8130.md) and so
belongs to him, since it comes from him, it may possibly be such in
quality exactly as the personal subject himself is from whom it
proceeds, and to whom it belongs. And thus the Spirit is God, and the
Word is God, because proceeding from God, but yet is not actually the
very same as He from whom He proceeds. Now that which is God of God,
although He is an actually existing thing, <span
id="fr_8131"></span>[8132](#fn_8131.md) yet He cannot be God Himself <span
id="fr_8132"></span>[8133](#fn_8132) (exclusively.md), but so far God as He
is of the same substance as God Himself, and as being an actually
existing thing, and as a portion of the Whole. Much more will “the power
of the Highest” not be the Highest Himself, because It is not an
actually existing thing, as being Spirit—in the same way as the *wisdom*
(of God) and the *providence* (of God) is not God: these *attributes*
are not substances, but the accidents of the particular substance. Power
is incidental to the Spirit, but cannot itself be the Spirit.  These
things, therefore, whatsoever they are—(I mean) the Spirit of God, and
the Word and the Power—having been conferred on the Virgin, that which
is born of her is the Son of God. This He Himself, in those other
Gospels also, testifies Himself to have been from His very boyhood:
“Wist ye not,” says He, “that I must be about *my Father’s*
business?” <span id="fr_8133"></span>[8134](#fn_8133.md) Satan likewise
knew Him to be this in his temptations: “Since Thou art *the Son of
God*.” <span id="fr_8134"></span>[8135](#fn_8134.md) This, accordingly, the
devils also acknowledge Him to be: “we know Thee, who Thou art, the
*Holy Son of God*.” <span id="fr_8135"></span>[8136](#fn_8135.md) His
“*Father*” He Himself adores. <span id="fr_8136"></span>[8137](#fn_8136.md)
When acknowledged by Peter as the “Christ (the Son) of God,” <span
id="fr_8137"></span>[8138](#fn_8137.md) He does not deny *the relation*. He
exults in spirit when He says to the Father, “I thank Thee, *O Father*,
because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent.” <span
id="fr_8138"></span>[8139](#fn_8138.md) He, moreover, affirms also that to
no man is the Father known, but to *His Son*; <span
id="fr_8139"></span>[8140](#fn_8139.md) and promises that, as *the Son of
the Father*, He will confess those who confess Him, and deny those who
deny Him, before His Father. <span id="fr_8140"></span>[8141](#fn_8140.md)
He also introduces a parable of the mission to the vineyard of the Son
(not the Father), who was sent after so many servants, <span
id="fr_8141"></span>[8142](#fn_8141.md) and slain by the husbandmen, and
<span id="page_623">p. 623</span> <span
id="v.ix.xxvi-Page_623"></span>avenged by the Father. He is also
ignorant of the last day and hour, which is known to the Father
only. <span id="fr_8142"></span>[8143](#fn_8142.md) He awards the kingdom
to His disciples, as He says it had been appointed to Himself by the
Father. <span id="fr_8143"></span>[8144](#fn_8143.md) He has power to ask,
if He will, legions of angels from the Father for His help. <span
id="fr_8144"></span>[8145](#fn_8144.md) He exclaims that God had forsaken
Him. <span id="fr_8145"></span>[8146](#fn_8145.md) He commends His spirit
into the hands of the Father. <span id="fr_8146"></span>[8147](#fn_8146.md)
After His resurrection He promises in a pledge to His disciples that He
will send them the promise of His Father; <span
id="fr_8147"></span>[8148](#fn_8147.md) and lastly, He commands them to
baptize into the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, not into a
unipersonal God. <span id="fr_8148"></span>[8149](#fn_8148.md) And indeed
it is not once only, but three times, that we are immersed into the
Three Persons, at each several mention of Their names.
