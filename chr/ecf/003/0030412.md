<span id="v.iv.v.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Christ’s Connection with the
Creator Shown. Many Quotations Out of the Old Testament Prophetically
Bear on Certain Events of the Life of Jesus—Such as His Ascent to
Praying on the Mountain; His Selection of Twelve Apostles; His Changing
Simon’s Name to Peter, and Gentiles from Tyre and Sidon Resorting to
Him.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xiii-p2"></span>Surely to Sion He brings good tidings,
and to Jerusalem peace and all blessings; He goes up into a mountain,
and there spends a night in prayer, <span
id="fr_3903"></span>[3904](#fn_3903) and He is indeed heard by the
Father.  Accordingly turn over the prophets, and learn therefrom His
entire course. <span id="fr_3904"></span>[3905](#fn_3904) “Into the high
mountain,” says Isaiah, “get Thee up, who bringest good tidings to Sion;
lift up Thy voice with strength, who bringest good tidings to
Jerusalem.” <span id="fr_3905"></span>[3906](#fn_3905) “They were
mightily <span id="fr_3906"></span>[3907](#fn_3906) astonished at His
doctrine; for He was teaching as one who had power.” <span
id="fr_3907"></span>[3908](#fn_3907) And again:  “Therefore, my people
shall know my name in that day.” What name *does the prophet mean*, but
Christ’s?  “That I am He that doth speak—even I.” <span
id="fr_3908"></span>[3909](#fn_3908) For it was He who used to speak in
the prophets—the Word, the Creator’s Son. “I am present, while it is the
hour, upon the mountains, as one that bringeth glad tidings of peace, as
one that publisheth good tidings of good.” <span
id="fr_3909"></span>[3910](#fn_3909) So one of the twelve (minor
prophets), Nahum: “For behold upon the mountain the swift feet of Him
that bringeth glad tidings of peace.” <span
id="fr_3910"></span>[3911](#fn_3910) Moreover, concerning the voice of
His prayer to the Father by night, the psalm manifestly says: “O my God,
I will cry in the day-time, and Thou shalt hear; and in the night
season, and it shall not be in vain to me.” <span
id="fr_3911"></span>[3912](#fn_3911) In another passage touching the
same voice and place, the psalm says: “I cried unto the Lord with my
voice, and He heard me out of His holy mountain.” <span
id="fr_3912"></span>[3913](#fn_3912) You have a representation of the
name; you have the action of the Evangelizer; you have a mountain for
the site; and the night as the time; and the sound of a voice; and the
audience of the Father: you have, (in short,) the Christ of the
prophets. But why was it that He chose *twelve* apostles, <span
id="fr_3913"></span>[3914](#fn_3913) and not some other number? In
truth, <span id="fr_3914"></span>[3915](#fn_3914) I might from this very
point conclude <span id="fr_3915"></span>[3916](#fn_3915) of my Christ,
that He was foretold not only by the words of prophets, but by the
indications of facts. For of this number I find figurative hints up and
down the Creator’s dispensation <span
id="fr_3916"></span>[3917](#fn_3916) in the twelve springs of
Elim; <span id="fr_3917"></span>[3918](#fn_3917) in the twelve gems of
Aaron’s priestly vestment; <span id="fr_3918"></span>[3919](#fn_3918)
and in the twelve stones appointed by Joshua to be taken out of the
Jordan, and set up for the ark of the covenant. Now, the same number of
apostles was thus portended, as if they were to be fountains and rivers
which should water the Gentile world, which was formerly dry and
destitute of knowledge (as He says by Isaiah:  “I will put streams in
the unwatered ground” <span id="fr_3919"></span>[3920](#fn_3919) ); as
if they were to be gems to shed lustre upon the church’s sacred <span
id="page_365">p. 365</span> <span id="v.iv.v.xiii-Page_365"></span>robe,
which Christ, the High Priest of the Father, puts on; as if, also, they
were to be stones massive in their faith, which the true Joshua took out
of the laver of the Jordan, and placed in the sanctuary of His
covenant.  What equally good defence of such a number has Marcion’s
Christ to show? It is impossible that anything can be shown to have been
done by him unconnectedly, <span id="fr_3920"></span>[3921](#fn_3920)
which cannot be shown to have been done by my Christ in connection (with
preceding types). <span id="fr_3921"></span>[3922](#fn_3921) To him will
appertain the event <span id="fr_3922"></span>[3923](#fn_3922) in whom
is discovered the preparation for the same. <span
id="fr_3923"></span>[3924](#fn_3923) Again, He changes the name of Simon
to Peter, <span id="fr_3924"></span>[3925](#fn_3924) inasmuch as the
Creator also altered the names of Abram, and Sarai, and Oshea, by
calling the latter Joshua, and adding a syllable to each of the former.
But why *Peter*? If it was because of the vigour of his faith, there
were many solid materials which might lend a name from their strength.
Was it because Christ was both a rock and a stone? For we read of His
being placed “for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence.” <span
id="fr_3925"></span>[3926](#fn_3925) I omit the rest of the
passage. <span id="fr_3926"></span>[3927](#fn_3926) Therefore He would
fain <span id="fr_3927"></span>[3928](#fn_3927) impart to the dearest of
His disciples a name which was suggested by one of His own especial
designations in figure; because it was, I suppose, more peculiarly fit
than a name which might have been derived from no figurative description
of Himself. <span id="fr_3928"></span>[3929](#fn_3928) There come to Him
from Tyre, and from other districts even, a transmarine multitude.  This
fact the psalm had in view:  “And behold tribes of foreign people, and
Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians; they were there. Sion is my
mother, shall a man say; and in her was born a man” (forasmuch as the
God-man was born), and He built her by the Father’s will; that you may
know how Gentiles then flocked to Him, because He was born the God-man
who was to build the church according to the Father’s will—even of other
races also. <span id="fr_3929"></span>[3930](#fn_3929) So says Isaiah
too: “Behold, these come from far; and these from the north and from the
west; <span id="fr_3930"></span>[3931](#fn_3930) and these from the land
of the Persians.” <span id="fr_3931"></span>[3932](#fn_3931) Concerning
whom He says again: “Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold, all
these have gathered themselves together.” <span
id="fr_3932"></span>[3933](#fn_3932) And yet again: “Thou seest these
unknown and strange ones; and thou wilt say in thine heart, Who hath
begotten me these? But who hath brought me up these? And these, where
have they been?” <span id="fr_3933"></span>[3934](#fn_3933) Will such a
Christ not be (the Christ) of the prophets? And what will be the Christ
of the Marcionites? Since perversion of truth is their pleasure, he
could not be (the Christ) of the prophets.
