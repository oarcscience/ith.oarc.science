<span id="v.viii.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—Explanation of What is Meant
by the Body, Which is to Be Raised Again. Not the Corporeality of the
Soul.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxxv-p2"></span>But He also teaches us, that “He is
rather to be feared, who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell,”
that is, the Lord alone; “not those which kill the body, but are not
able to hurt the soul,” <span id="fr_7511"></span>[7512](#fn_7511.md) that
is to say, all human powers. Here, then, we have a recognition of the
natural immortality of the soul, which cannot be killed by men; and of
the mortality of the body, which may be killed: *whence we learn* that
the resurrection of the dead is a resurrection of the flesh; for unless
it were raised again, it would be impossible for the flesh to be “killed
in hell.” But as a question may be here captiously raised about the
meaning of “the body” (or “the flesh”), I will at once state that I
understand by the human body nothing else than that fabric of the flesh
which, whatever be the kind of material of which it is constructed and
modified, is seen and handled, and sometimes indeed killed, by men. In
like manner, I should not admit that anything but cement and stones and
bricks form the *body* of a wall. If any one imports into our argument
some body of a subtle, secret nature, he must show, disclose, and prove
to me that that identical body is the very one which was slain by human
violence, and then (I will grant) that it is of such a body that (our
scripture) speaks. If, again, the body *or corporeal nature* of the
soul <span id="fr_7512"></span>[7513](#fn_7512.md) is cast in my teeth, it
will only be an idle subterfuge! For since both substances are set
before us (in this passage, which affirms) that “body and soul” are
destroyed in hell, a distinction is obviously made between the two; and
we are left to understand the body to be that which is tangible to us,
that is, the flesh, which, as it will be destroyed in hell—since it did
not “rather fear” being destroyed by God—so also will it be restored to
life eternal, since it preferred to be killed by human hands. If,
therefore, any one shall violently suppose that the destruction of the
soul and the flesh in hell amounts to a final annihilation of the two
substances, and not to their penal treatment (as if they were to be
consumed, not punished), let him recollect that the fire of hell is
eternal—expressly announced as an everlasting penalty; and let him then
admit that it is from this circumstance that this never-ending “killing”
is more formidable than a merely human murder, which is only temporal.
He will then <span id="page_571">p. 571</span> <span
id="v.viii.xxxv-Page_571"></span>come to the conclusion that substances
must be eternal, when their penal “killing” is an eternal one. Since,
then, the body after the resurrection has to be killed by God in hell
along with the soul, we surely have sufficient information in this fact
respecting both the issues *which await it*, namely the resurrection of
the flesh, and its eternal “killing.” Else it would be most absurd if
the flesh should be raised up and destined to “the killing in hell,” in
order to be put an end to, when it might suffer such an annihilation
(more directly) if not raised again at all. A pretty paradox, <span
id="fr_7513"></span>[7514](#fn_7513.md) to be sure, that an essence must be
refitted with life, in order that it may receive that annihilation which
has already in fact accrued to it! *But Christ*, whilst confirming us in
the selfsame hope, adds the example of “the sparrows”—how that “not one
of them falls to the ground without the will of God.” <span
id="fr_7514"></span>[7515](#fn_7514.md) *He says this*, that you may
believe that the flesh which has been consigned to the ground, is able
in like manner to rise again by the will of the same God. For although
this is not allowed to the sparrows, yet “we are of more value than many
sparrows,” <span id="fr_7515"></span>[7516](#fn_7515.md) for the very
reason that, when fallen, we rise again. He affirms, lastly, that “the
very hairs of our head are all numbered,” <span
id="fr_7516"></span>[7517](#fn_7516.md) and in the affirmation He of course
includes the promise of their safety; for if they were to be lost, where
would be the use of having taken such a numerical care of them? Surely
the only use lies (in this truth): “That of all which the Father hath
given to me, I should lose none,” <span
id="fr_7517"></span>[7518](#fn_7517.md) —not even a hair, as also not an
eye nor a tooth.  And yet whence shall come that “weeping and gnashing
of teeth,” <span id="fr_7518"></span>[7519](#fn_7518.md) if not from *eyes
and teeth*?—even at that time when the body shall be slain in hell, and
thrust out into that outer darkness which shall be the suitable torment
of the eyes. He also who shall not be clothed at the marriage feast in
the raiment of good works, will have to be “bound hand and foot,”—as
being, of course, raised in his body.  So, again, the very reclining at
the feast in the kingdom of God, and sitting on Christ’s thrones, and
standing at last on His right hand and His left, and eating of the tree
of life:  what are all these but most certain proofs of a bodily
appointment and destination?
