<span id="v.iii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Heretics Not to Be Allowed to
Argue Out of the Scriptures. The Scriptures, in Fact, Do Not Belong to
Them. <span id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022.md) </span>

<span id="v.iii.xv-p3"></span>We are therefore come to (the gist of) our
position; for at this point we were aiming, and for this we were
preparing in the preamble of our address (which we have just
completed),—so that we may now join issue on the contention to which our
adversaries challenge us. They put forward <span
id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023.md) the Scriptures, and by this
insolence <span id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024.md) of theirs they at
once influence some.  In the encounter itself, however, they weary the
strong, they catch the weak, and dismiss waverers with a doubt. 
Accordingly, we oppose to them this step above all others, of not
admitting them to any discussion of the Scriptures. <span
id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025.md)

<span id="v.iii.xv-p7"></span>If in these lie their resources, before
they can use them, it ought to be clearly seen to whom belongs the
possession of the Scriptures, that none may be admitted to the use
thereof who has no title at all to the privilege.

<span id="v.iii.xv-p6"></span> De Scripturis. But as this preposition is
often the sign of the *instrument* in Tertullian, this phrase may mean
“*out of*,” or “*by means of* the Scriptures.” See the last chapter.
