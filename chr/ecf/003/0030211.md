<span id="iv.xi.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Soul’s Corporeality
Demonstrated Out of the Gospels.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.vii-p2"></span>So far as the philosophers are concerned,
we have said enough. As for our own teachers, indeed, our reference to
them is *ex abundanti*—a surplusage of authority: in the Gospel itself
they will be found to have the <span id="page_187">p. 187</span> <span
id="iv.xi.vii-Page_187"></span>clearest evidence for the corporeal
nature of the soul. In hell the soul of a certain man is in torment,
punished in flames, suffering excruciating thirst, and imploring from
the finger of a happier soul, for his tongue, the solace of a drop of
water. <span id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533) Do you suppose that
this end of the blessed poor man and the miserable rich man is only
imaginary? Then why the name of Lazarus in this narrative, if the
circumstance is not in (the category of) a real occurrence? But even if
it is to be regarded as imaginary, it will still be a testimony to truth
and reality. For unless the soul possessed corporeality, the image of a
soul could not possibly contain a finger of a bodily substance; nor
would the Scripture feign a statement about the limbs of a body, if
these had no existence. But what is that which is removed to Hades <span
id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534) after the separation of the body;
which is there detained; which is reserved until the day of judgment; to
which Christ also, on dying, descended? I imagine it is the souls of the
patriarchs. But wherefore (all this), if the soul is nothing in its
subterranean abode?  For *nothing* it certainly is, if it is not a
bodily substance. For whatever is incorporeal is incapable of being kept
and guarded in any way; it is also exempt from either punishment or
refreshment. That must be a body, by which punishment and refreshment
can be experienced. Of this I shall treat more fully in a more fitting
place. Therefore, whatever amount of punishment or refreshment the soul
tastes in Hades, in its prison or lodging, <span
id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535) in the fire or in Abraham’s bosom,
it gives proof thereby of its own corporeality. For an incorporeal thing
suffers nothing, not having that which makes it capable of suffering;
else, if it has such capacity, it must be a bodily substance. For in
*as* far as every corporeal thing is capable of suffering, in *so* far
is that which is capable of suffering also corporeal. <span

<span id="iv.xi.vii-p6"></span> Compare *De Resur. Carnis*, xvii. There
is, however, some variation in Tertullian’s language on this subject. 
In his *Apol.* xlviii. he speaks as if the soul could not suffer when
separated from the body. See also his *De Testimonio Animæ*, ch. iv., p.
177, *supra*; and see Bp. Kaye, p. 183.
