<span id="v.vi.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The Strange Jumble of the
Pleroma. The Frantic Delight of the Members Thereof. Their Joint
Contribution of Parts Set Forth with Humorous Irony.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xii-p2"></span>Thus they are all on the self-same footing
in respect of form and knowledge, all of them having become what each of
them severally is; none being a different being, because they are all
what the others are. <span id="fr_6744"></span>[6745](#fn_6744) They are
all turned into <span id="fr_6745"></span>[6746](#fn_6745) Nuses, into
Homos, into Theletuses; <span id="fr_6746"></span>[6747](#fn_6746) and
so in the case of the females, into Siges, into Zoes, into Ecclesias,
into Fortunatas, so that Ovid would have blotted out his own
Metamorphoses if he had only known our larger one in the present day. 
Straightway they were reformed and thoroughly established, and being
composed to rest from the truth, they celebrate the Father in a
chorus <span id="fr_6747"></span>[6748](#fn_6747) of praise in the
exuberance of their joy.  *The Father* himself also revelled <span
id="fr_6748"></span>[6749](#fn_6748) in the glad feeling; of course,
because his children and grandchildren sang so well. And why should he
not revel in absolute delight? Was not the Pleroma freed (from all
danger)? What ship’s captain <span id="fr_6749"></span>[6750](#fn_6749)
fails to rejoice even with indecent frolic?  Every day we observe the
uproarious ebullitions of sailors’ joys. <span
id="fr_6750"></span>[6751](#fn_6750) Therefore, as sailors always exult
over the reckoning they pay in common, so do these Æons enjoy a similar
pleasure, one as they now all are in form, and, as I may add, <span
id="fr_6751"></span>[6752](#fn_6751) in feeling too. With the
concurrence of even their new brethren and masters, <span
id="fr_6752"></span>[6753](#fn_6752) they contribute into one common
stock the best and most beautiful thing with which they are severally
adorned.  Vainly, as I suppose. For if they were all one by reason by
the above-mentioned thorough equalization, there was no room for the
process of a common reckoning, <span
id="fr_6753"></span>[6754](#fn_6753) which for the most part consists of
a pleasing variety. They all contributed the one good thing, which they
all were. There would be, in all probability, a formal procedure <span
id="fr_6754"></span>[6755](#fn_6754) in the mode or in the form of the
very equalization in question. Accordingly, out of the donation which
they contributed <span id="fr_6755"></span>[6756](#fn_6755) to the
honour and glory of the Father, they jointly fashion <span
id="fr_6756"></span>[6757](#fn_6756) the most beautiful constellation of
the Pleroma, and its perfect fruit, Jesus. Him they also surname <span
id="fr_6757"></span>[6758](#fn_6757) Soter (*Saviour*) and Christ, and
Sermo (*Word*) after his ancestors; <span
id="fr_6758"></span>[6759](#fn_6758) and lastly Omnia (*All Things*), as
formed from a universally culled nosegay, <span
id="fr_6759"></span>[6760](#fn_6759) *like* the jay of Æsop, the Pandora
of Hesiod, the bowl <span id="fr_6760"></span>[6761](#fn_6760) of
Accius, the honey-cake of Nestor, the miscellany of Ptolemy. How much
nearer the mark, if these idle title-mongers had called him Pancarpian,
after certain Athenian customs. <span
id="fr_6761"></span>[6762](#fn_6761) By way of adding external honour
also to their wonderful puppet, they produce for him a bodyguard of
angels of like nature. If this be their mutual condition, it may be all
right; if, however, they are consubstantial with Soter (for I have
discovered how doubtfully the case is stated), where will be his
eminence when surrounded by attendants who are co-equal with himself?
