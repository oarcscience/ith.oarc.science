<span id="v.iv.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—St. Luke’s Gospel, Selected by
Marcion as His Authority, and Mutilated by Him.  The Other Gospels
Equally Authoritative.  Marcion’s Terms of Discussion, However,
Accepted, and Grappled with on the Footing of St. Luke’s Gospel
Alone.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.ii-p2"></span>You have now our answer to the
*Antitheses* compendiously indicated by us. <span
id="fr_3515"></span>[3516](#fn_3515.md) I pass on to give a proof of the
Gospel <span id="fr_3516"></span>[3517](#fn_3516.md) —not, to be sure, of
Jewry, but of Pontus—having become meanwhile <span
id="fr_3517"></span>[3518](#fn_3517.md) adulterated; and this shall
indicate <span id="fr_3518"></span>[3519](#fn_3518.md) the order by which
we proceed. We lay it down as our first position, that the evangelical
Testament <span id="fr_3519"></span>[3520](#fn_3519.md) has apostles for
its authors, <span id="fr_3520"></span>[3521](#fn_3520.md) to whom was
assigned by the Lord Himself this office of publishing the gospel.
Since, however, there are apostolic <span
id="fr_3521"></span>[3522](#fn_3521.md) men also, <span
id="fr_3522"></span>[3523](#fn_3522.md) they are yet not alone, but appear
with apostles and after apostles; because the preaching of disciples
might be open to the suspicion of an affectation of glory, if there did
not accompany it <span id="fr_3523"></span>[3524](#fn_3523.md) the
authority of the masters, which means that of Christ, <span
id="fr_3524"></span>[3525](#fn_3524.md) for it was that which made the
apostles their masters. Of the apostles, therefore, John and Matthew
first instil <span id="fr_3525"></span>[3526](#fn_3525.md) faith into us;
whilst of apostolic men, Luke and Mark renew it afterwards. <span
id="fr_3526"></span>[3527](#fn_3526.md) These all start with the same
principles of the faith, <span id="fr_3527"></span>[3528](#fn_3527.md) so
far as relates to the one only God the Creator and His Christ, how that
He was born of the Virgin, and came to fulfil <span
id="fr_3528"></span>[3529](#fn_3528.md) the law and the prophets. Never
mind <span id="fr_3529"></span>[3530](#fn_3529.md) if there does occur some
variation in the order of their narratives, provided that there be
agreement in the essential matter <span
id="fr_3530"></span>[3531](#fn_3530.md) of the faith, in which there is
disagreement with Marcion. Marcion, on the other hand, you must
know, <span id="fr_3531"></span>[3532](#fn_3531.md) ascribes no author to
his Gospel, as if it could not be allowed him to affix a title to that
from which it was no crime (in his eyes) to subvert <span
id="fr_3532"></span>[3533](#fn_3532.md) the very body. And here I might now
make a stand, and contend that a work ought not to be recognised, which
holds not its head erect, which exhibits no consistency, which gives no
promise of credibility from the fulness of its title and the just
profession of its author. But we prefer to join issue <span
id="fr_3533"></span>[3534](#fn_3533.md) on every point; nor shall we leave
unnoticed <span id="fr_3534"></span>[3535](#fn_3534.md) what may fairly be
understood to be on our side. <span id="fr_3535"></span>[3536](#fn_3535.md)
Now, of the authors whom we possess, Marcion seems to have singled out
Luke <span id="fr_3536"></span>[3537](#fn_3536.md) for his mutilating
process. <span id="fr_3537"></span>[3538](#fn_3537.md) Luke, however, was
not an apostle, but only an apostolic man; not a master, but a disciple,
and so inferior to a master—at least as far subsequent to <span
id="fr_3538"></span>[3539](#fn_3538.md) him as the apostle whom he followed
(and that, no doubt, was Paul <span id="fr_3539"></span>[3540](#fn_3539.md)
) was subsequent to the others; so that, had Marcion even published his
Gospel in the name of St. Paul himself, the single authority of the
document, <span id="fr_3540"></span>[3541](#fn_3540.md) destitute of all
support from preceding authorities, would not be a sufficient basis for
our faith. There would be still wanted that Gospel which St. Paul found
in existence, to which he yielded <span id="page_348">p. 348</span>
<span id="v.iv.v.ii-Page_348"></span>his belief, and with which he so
earnestly wished his own to agree, that he actually on that account went
up to Jerusalem to know and consult the apostles, “lest he should run,
or had been running in vain;” <span id="fr_3541"></span>[3542](#fn_3541.md)
in other words, that the faith which he had learned, and the gospel
which he was preaching, might be in accordance with theirs. Then, at
last, having conferred with the (primitive) authors, and having agreed
with them touching the rule of faith, they joined their hands in
fellowship, and divided their labours thenceforth in the office of
preaching the gospel, so that they were to go to the Jews, and St. Paul
to the Jews and the Gentiles.  Inasmuch, therefore, as the enlightener
of St. Luke himself desired the authority of his predecessors for both
his own faith and preaching, how much more may not I require for Luke’s
Gospel that which was necessary for the Gospel of his master. <span
