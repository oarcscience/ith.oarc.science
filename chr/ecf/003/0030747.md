<span id="vi.iv.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Second Clause.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p2"></span>The name of “God the Father” had been
published to none. Even Moses, who had interrogated Him on that very
point, had heard a different name. <span
id="fr_8772"></span>[8773](#fn_8772.md) To us it has been revealed in the
Son, for the Son is now the Father’s new name. “I am come,” saith He,
“in the Father’s name;” <span id="fr_8773"></span>[8774](#fn_8773.md) and
again, “Father, glorify Thy name;” <span
id="fr_8774"></span>[8775](#fn_8774.md) and more openly, “I have manifested
Thy name to men.” <span id="fr_8775"></span>[8776](#fn_8775.md) That
*name*, therefore, we pray may “be hallowed.”  Not that it is becoming
for men to *wish* God *well*, as if there were any other <span
id="fr_8776"></span>[8777](#fn_8776.md) by whom He may be wished well, or
as if He would suffer unless we do so wish. Plainly, it is universally
becoming for God to be *blessed* <span
id="fr_8777"></span>[8778](#fn_8777.md) in every place and time, on account
of the memory of His benefits ever due from every man. But this petition
also serves the turn of a blessing. Otherwise, when is the name of God
not “holy,” and “hallowed” through Himself, seeing that of Himself He
sanctifies all others—He to whom that surrounding circle of angels cease
not to say, “Holy, holy, holy?” <span
id="fr_8778"></span>[8779](#fn_8778.md) In like wise, therefore, we too,
candidates for angelhood, if we succeed in deserving it, begin even here
on earth to learn by heart that strain hereafter to be raised unto God,
and the function of future glory. So far, for the glory of God. On the
other hand, for our own petition, when we say, “Hallowed be Thy name,”
we pray this; that it may be hallowed *in us* who are in Him, as well in
all others for whom the grace of God is still waiting; <span
id="fr_8779"></span>[8780](#fn_8779.md) that we may obey this precept, too,
in “praying for all,” <span id="fr_8780"></span>[8781](#fn_8780.md) even
for our personal enemies. <span id="fr_8781"></span>[8782](#fn_8781.md) And
therefore with suspended utterance, not saying, “Hallowed be it *in
us*,” we say,—“*in all*.”
