<span id="iv.xi.l-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter L.—The Absurd Opinion of Epicurus and
the Profane Conceits of the Heretic Menander on Death, Even Enoch and
Elijah Reserved for Death.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.l-p2"></span>We have by this time said enough about
sleep, the mirror and image of death; and likewise about the occupations
of sleep, even dreams. Let us now go on to consider the cause of our
departure hence—that is, the appointment and course of death—because we
must not leave even it unquestioned and unexamined, although it is
itself the very end of all questions and investigations. According to
the general sentiment of the human race, we declare death to be “the
debt of nature.” So much has been settled by the voice of God; <span
id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781.md) such is the contract with
everything which is born: so that even from this the frigid conceit of
Epicurus is refuted, who says that no such debt is due from us; and not
only so, but the insane opinion of the Samaritan heretic Menander is
also rejected, who will have it that death has not only nothing to do
with his disciples, but in fact never reaches them. He pretends to have
received such a commission from the secret power of One above, that all
who partake of his baptism become immortal, incorruptible and
instantaneously invested with resurrection-life. We read, no doubt, of
very many wonderful kinds of waters: how, for instance, the vinous
quality of the stream intoxicates people who drink of the Lyncestis; how
at Colophon the waters of an oracle-inspiring fountain <span
id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782.md) affect men with madness; how
Alexander was killed by the poisonous water from Mount Nonacris in
Arcadia. Then, again, there was in Judea before the time of Christ a
pool of medicinal virtue. It is well known how the poet has commemorated
the marshy Styx as preserving men from death; although Thetis had, in
spite of the preservative, to lament her son. And for the matter of
that, were Menander himself to take a plunge into this famous Styx, he
would certainly have to die after all; for you must come to the Styx,
placed as it is by all accounts in the regions of the dead. Well, but
what and where are those blessed and charming waters which not even John
Baptist ever used in his preministrations, nor Christ after him ever
revealed to His disciples? What was this wondrous bath of Menander? He
is a comical fellow, I ween. <span id="fr_1783"></span>[1784](#fn_1783.md)
But why (was such a font) so seldom in request, so obscure, one to which
so very few ever resorted for their cleansing? I really see something to
suspect in so rare an occurrence of a sacrament to which is attached so
very much security and safety, and which dispenses with the ordinary law
of dying even in the service of God Himself, when, on the contrary, all
nations have “to ascend to the mount of the Lord and to the house of the
God of Jacob,” who demands of His saints in martyrdom that death which
He exacted even of His Christ. No one will ascribe to magic such
influence as shall exempt from death, or which shall refresh and vivify
life, like the vine by the renewal of its condition. Such power was not
accorded to the great Medea herself—over a human being at any rate, if
allowed her over a silly sheep. Enoch no doubt was translated, <span
id="fr_1784"></span>[1785](#fn_1784.md) and so was Elijah; <span
id="fr_1785"></span>[1786](#fn_1785.md) nor did they experience death: it
was postponed, (and only postponed,) most certainly: they are reserved
for the suffering of death, that by their blood <span id="page_228">p.
228</span> <span id="iv.xi.l-Page_228"></span>they may extinguish
Antichrist. <span id="fr_1786"></span>[1787](#fn_1786.md) Even John
underwent death, although concerning him there had prevailed an
ungrounded expectation that he would remain alive until the coming of
the Lord. <span id="fr_1787"></span>[1788](#fn_1787.md) Heresies, indeed,
for the most part spring hurriedly into existence, from examples
furnished by ourselves: they procure their defensive armour from the
very place which they attack. The whole question resolves itself, in
short, into this challenge: Where are to be found the men whom Menander
himself has baptized? whom he has plunged into his Styx? Let them come
forth and stand before us—those apostles of his whom he has made
immortal?  Let my (doubting) Thomas see them, let him hear them, let him
handle them—and he is convinced.
