<span id="v.x.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.x.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.</span>

<span id="v.x.viii-p2"></span>We keep therefore the one position, and,
in respect of this question only, summon to an encounter, whether
martyrdoms have been commanded by God, that you may believe that they
have been commanded by reason, if you know that they have been commanded
by Him, because God will not command ought without reason. Since the
death of His own saints is precious is His sight, as David sings, <span
id="fr_8263"></span>[8264](#fn_8263.md) it is not, I think, that one which
falls to the lot of men generally, and is a debt due by all (rather is
that one even disgraceful on account of the trespass, and the desert of
condemnation *to which it is to be traced*), but that *other* which is
met in this very work—in bearing witness for religion, and maintaining
the fight of confession in behalf of righteousness and the sacrament. As
saith Esaias, “See how the righteous man perisheth, and no one layeth it
to heart; and righteous men are taken away, and no one considereth it:
for from before the face of unrighteousness the righteous man perisheth,
and he shall have honour at his burial.” <span
id="fr_8264"></span>[8265](#fn_8264.md) Here, too, you have both an
announcement of martyrdoms, and *of* the recompense they bring. From the
beginning, indeed, righteousness suffers violence.  Forthwith, as soon
as God has begun to be worshipped, religion has got ill-will for her
portion. He who had pleased God is slain, and that by his brother. 
Beginning with kindred blood, in order that it might the more easily go
in quest of that of strangers, ungodliness made the object of its
pursuit, finally, that not only of righteous persons, but even of
prophets also. David is persecuted; Elias put to flight; Jeremias
stoned; Esaias cut asunder; Zacharias butchered between the altar and
the temple, imparting to the hard stones lasting marks of his
blood. <span id="fr_8265"></span>[8266](#fn_8265.md) That person himself,
at the close of the law and the prophets, and called not a prophet, but
a messenger, is, suffering an ignominious death, beheaded to reward a
dancing-girl. And certainly they who were wont to be led by the Spirit
of God used to be guided by Himself to martyrdoms; so that they had even
already to endure what they had also proclaimed as requiring to be
borne. Wherefore the brotherhood of the three also, when the dedication
of the royal image was the occasion of the citizens being pressed to
offer worship, knew well what faith, which alone in them had not been
taken captive, required,—namely, that they must resist idolatry to the
death. <span id="fr_8266"></span>[8267](#fn_8266.md) For they remembered
also the words of Jeremias writing to those over whom that captivity was
impending: “And now ye shall see borne upon (men’s) shoulders the gods
of the Babylonians, of gold and silver and wood, causing fear to the
Gentiles. Beware, therefore, that ye also do not be altogether like the
foreigners, and be seized with fear while ye behold crowds worshipping
those gods before and behind, but say in your mind, Our duty is to
worship Thee, O Lord.” <span id="fr_8267"></span>[8268](#fn_8267.md)
Therefore, having got confidence from God, they said, when with strength
of mind they set at defiance the king’s threats against the disobedient:
“There is no necessity for our making answer to this command of yours.
For our God whom we worship is able to deliver us from the furnace of
fire and from your hands; and then it will be made plain to you that we
shall neither serve your idol, nor worship your golden image which you
have set up.” <span id="fr_8268"></span>[8269](#fn_8268.md) O martyrdom
even without suffering perfect! Enough did they suffer! enough were they
burned, <span id="page_641">p. 641</span> <span
id="v.x.viii-Page_641"></span>whom on this account God shielded, that it
might not seem that they had given a false representation of His power.
For forthwith, certainly, would the lions, with their pent-up and wonted
savageness, have devoured Daniel also, a worshipper of none but God, and
therefore accused and demanded by the Chaldeans, if it had been right
that the worthy anticipation of Darius concerning God should have proved
delusive.  For the rest, every preacher of God, and every worshipper
also, such as, having been summoned to the service of idolatry, had
refused compliance, ought to have suffered, agreeably to the tenor of
that argument too, by which the truth ought to have been recommended
both to those who were then living and to those following in
succession,—(namely), that the suffering of its defenders themselves
bespeak trust for it, because nobody would have been willing to be slain
but one possessing the truth. Such commands as well as instances,
remounting to earliest times, show that believers are under obligation
to suffer martyrdom.
