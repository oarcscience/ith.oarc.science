<span id="iv.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Other Arts Made Subservient to
Idolatry. Lawful Means of Gaining a Livelihood Abundant.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p2"></span>There are also other species of very
many arts which, although they extend not to the *making* of idols, yet,
with the same criminality, *furnish the adjuncts* without which idols
have no power. For it matters not whether you erect or equip: if you
have embellished his temple, altar, or niche; if you have pressed out
gold-leaf, or have wrought his insignia, or even his house:  work of
that kind, which confers not *shape*, but *authority*, is more
important. If the necessity of main<span id="page_65">p. 65</span> <span
id="iv.iv.viii-Page_65"></span>tenance <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) is urged so much, the arts have other
species withal to afford means of livelihood, without outstepping the
path of discipline, that is, without the confiction of an idol. The
plasterer knows both how to mend roofs, and lay on stuccoes, and polish
a cistern, and trace ogives, and draw in relief on party-walls many
other ornaments beside likenesses. The painter, too, the marble mason,
the bronze-worker, and every graver whatever, knows expansions <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) of his own art, of course much easier
of execution. For how much more easily does he who delineates a statue
overlay a sideboard! <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) How much
sooner does he who carves a Mars out of a lime-tree, fasten together a
chest!  No art but is either mother or kinswoman of some neighbour <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) art: nothing is independent of its
neighbour. The veins of the arts are many as are the concupiscences of
men.  “But there is difference in wages and the rewards of handicraft;”
therefore there is difference, too, in the labour required. Smaller
wages are compensated by more frequent earning. How many are the
party-walls which require statues? How many the temples and shrines
which are built for idols? But houses, and official residences, and
baths, and tenements, how many are they?  Shoe- and slipper-gilding is
daily work; not so the gilding of Mercury and Serapis. Let that suffice
for the gain <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) of handicrafts.
Luxury and ostentation have more votaries than all superstition. 
Ostentation will require dishes and cups more easily than superstition.
Luxury deals in wreaths, also, more than ceremony. When, therefore, we
urge men generally to such kinds of handicrafts as do not come in
contact with an idol indeed and with the things which are appropriate to
an idol; since, moreover, the things which are common to idols are often
common to men too; of this also we ought to beware that nothing be, with
our knowledge, demanded by any person from our idols’ service.  For if
we shall have made that concession, and shall not have had recourse to
the remedies so often used, I think we are not free of the contagion of
idolatry, we whose (not unwitting) hands <span
id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) are found busied in the tendence, or
in the honour and service, of demons.

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p5"></span> Abacum. The word has various meanings;
but this, perhaps, is its most general use: as, for instance, in Horace
and Juvenal.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[65:204](0030066.htm#fr_203.md) <span

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p6"></span> Alterius = <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.viii-p6.1"></span>ἑτέρον</span> which in the New Testament is
= to “neighbour” in [Rom. xiii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.iv.viii-p6.2"></span>, etc. \[Our author must have borne in mind
Cicero’s beautiful words—“Etenim omnes artes quæ ad humanitatem
pertinent habent quoddam commune vinculum,” etc. *Pro Archia*, i. tom.
x. p. 10. *Ed.* Paris, 1817.\]

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p7"></span> Quæstum. Another reading is “questum,”
which would require us to translate “plaint.”

<span id="fn_205"></span>[65:206](0030066.htm#fr_205.md) <span
id="iv.iv.viii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p8"></span> “Quorum manus non ignorantium,” i.e.,
“the hands of whom not unwitting;” which may be rendered as above,
because in English, as in the Latin, in adjective “unwitting” belongs to
the “whose,” not to the “hands.”
