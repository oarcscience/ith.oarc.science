id="v.iv.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Man the Image of the
Creator, and Christ the Head of the Man.  Spiritual Gifts. The Sevenfold
Spirit Described by Isaiah. The Apostle and the Prophet Compared.
Marcion Challenged to Produce Anything Like These Gifts of the Spirit
Foretold in Prophecy in His God.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.viii-p2"></span>“The head of every man is
Christ.” <span id="fr_5528"></span>[5529](#fn_5528.md) What Christ, if He
is not the author of man? The *head* he has here put for *authority*;
now “authority” will accrue to none else than the “author.” Of what man
indeed is He the head? Surely of him concerning whom he adds soon
afterwards: “The man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the
image of God.” <span id="fr_5529"></span>[5530](#fn_5529.md) Since then he
is the image of the Creator (for *He*, when looking on Christ His Word,
who was to become man, said, “Let us make man in our own image, after
our likeness” <span id="fr_5530"></span>[5531](#fn_5530) .md), how can I
possibly have another head but Him whose image I am? For if I am the
image of the Creator there is no room in me for another head. But
wherefore “ought the woman to have power over her head, because of the
angels?” <span id="fr_5531"></span>[5532](#fn_5531.md) If it is because
“she was created for the man,” <span
id="fr_5532"></span>[5533](#fn_5532.md) and taken out of the man, according
to the Creator’s purpose, then in this way too has the apostle
maintained the discipline of that God from whose institution he explains
the reasons of His discipline. He adds:  “Because of the angels.” <span
id="fr_5533"></span>[5534](#fn_5533.md) What angels?  In other words, whose
angels? If he means the fallen angels of the Creator, <span
id="fr_5534"></span>[5535](#fn_5534.md) there is great propriety in his
meaning.  It is right that that face which was a snare to them should
wear some mark of a humble guise and obscured beauty.  If, however, the
angels of the rival god are referred to, what fear is there for them?
for not even Marcion’s disciples, (to say nothing of his angels,) have
any desire for women. We have often shown before now, that the apostle
classes heresies as evil <span id="fr_5535"></span>[5536](#fn_5535.md)
among “works of the flesh,” and that he would have those persons
accounted estimable <span id="fr_5536"></span>[5537](#fn_5536.md) who shun
heresies as an evil thing. In like manner, when treating of the
gospel, <span id="fr_5537"></span>[5538](#fn_5537.md) we have proved from
the sacrament of the bread and the cup <span
id="fr_5538"></span>[5539](#fn_5538.md) the verity of the Lord’s body and
blood in opposition to Marcion’s phantom; whilst throughout almost the
whole of my work it has been contended that all mention of judicial
attributes points conclusively to the Creator as to a God who judges.
Now, on the subject of “spiritual gifts,” <span
id="fr_5539"></span>[5540](#fn_5539.md) I have to remark that these also
were promised by the Creator through Christ; and I think that we may
derive from this a very just conclusion that the bestowal of a gift is
not the work of a god other than Him who is proved to have given the
promise. Here is a prophecy of Isaiah: “There shall come forth a rod out
of the stem of Jesse, and a flower <span
id="fr_5540"></span>[5541](#fn_5540.md) shall spring up from his root; and
upon Him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord.” After which he enumerates
the special gifts of the same: “The spirit of wisdom and understanding,
the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of
religion. <span id="fr_5541"></span>[5542](#fn_5541.md) And with the fear
of the Lord <span id="fr_5542"></span>[5543](#fn_5542.md) shall the Spirit
fill Him.” <span id="fr_5543"></span>[5544](#fn_5543.md) In this figure of
*a flower* he shows that Christ was to arise out of the rod which sprang
from the stem of Jesse; in other words, from the virgin of the race of
David, the son of Jesse. In this Christ the whole *substantia* of the
Spirit would have to rest, not meaning that it would be as it were some
subsequent acquisition accruing to Him who was always, even before His
incarnation, the Spirit of God; <span
id="fr_5544"></span>[5545](#fn_5544.md) so that you cannot argue from this
that the prophecy has reference to that Christ who (as mere man of the
race only of David) was to obtain the Spirit of his God. (The prophet
says,) on the contrary, that from the time when (the true Christ) should
appear in the flesh as *the flower predicted*, <span
id="fr_5545"></span>[5546](#fn_5545.md) rising from the root of Jesse,
there would have to rest upon Him the entire operation of the Spirit of
grace, which, so far as the Jews were concerned, would cease and come to
an end. This result the case itself shows; for after this time the
Spirit <span id="page_446">p. 446</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.viii-Page_446"></span>of the Creator never breathed amongst
*them*. From Judah were taken away “the wise man, and the cunning
artificer, and the counsellor, and the prophet;” <span
id="fr_5546"></span>[5547](#fn_5546.md) that so it might prove true that
“the law and the prophets were until John.” <span
id="fr_5547"></span>[5548](#fn_5547.md) Now hear how he declared that by
Christ Himself, when returned to heaven, these spiritual gifts were to
be sent: “He ascended up on high,” that is, into heaven; “He led
captivity captive,” meaning death or slavery of man; “He gave gifts to
the sons of men,” <span id="fr_5548"></span>[5549](#fn_5548.md) that is,
the gratuities, which we call *<span class="c42"><span
id="v.iv.vi.viii-p23.2"></span>charismata</span>*. He says specifically
“*sons of men*,” <span id="fr_5549"></span>[5550](#fn_5549.md) and not men
promiscuously; thus exhibiting to us those who were the children of men
truly so called, choice men, apostles.  “For,” says he, “I have begotten
you through the gospel;” <span id="fr_5550"></span>[5551](#fn_5550.md) and
“Ye are my children, of whom I travail again in birth.” <span
id="fr_5551"></span>[5552](#fn_5551.md) Now was absolutely fulfilled that
promise of the Spirit which was given by the word of Joel:  “In the last
days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and
their daughters shall prophesy; and upon my servants and upon my
handmaids will I pour out of my Spirit.” <span
id="fr_5552"></span>[5553](#fn_5552.md) Since, then, the Creator promised
the gift of His Spirit in the latter days; and since Christ has in these
last days appeared as the dispenser of spiritual gifts (as the apostle
says, “When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His
Son;” <span id="fr_5553"></span>[5554](#fn_5553.md) and again, “This I say,
brethren, that the time is short” <span
id="fr_5554"></span>[5555](#fn_5554) .md), it evidently follows in
connection with this prediction of the last days, that this gift of the
Spirit belongs to Him who is the Christ of the predicters. Now compare
the Spirit’s specific graces, as they are described by the apostle, and
promised by the prophet Isaiah. “To one is given,” says he, “by the
Spirit the word of wisdom;” this we see at once is what Isaiah declared
to be “the spirit of wisdom.”  “To another, the word of knowledge;” this
will be “the (prophet’s) spirit of understanding and counsel.” “To
another, faith by the same Spirit;” this will be “the spirit of religion
and the fear of the Lord.” “To another, the gifts of healing, and to
another the working of miracles;” this will be “the spirit of might.”
“To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another
divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues;” this
will be “the spirit of knowledge.” <span
id="fr_5555"></span>[5556](#fn_5555.md) See how the apostle agrees with the
prophet both in making the distribution of the one Spirit, and in
interpreting His special graces. This, too, I may confidently say: he
who has likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers
members to the compacting together of the various gifts of the
Spirit, <span id="fr_5556"></span>[5557](#fn_5556.md) shows also that there
is but one Lord of the human body and of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit,
(according to the apostle’s showing,) <span
id="fr_5557"></span>[5558](#fn_5557.md) meant not <span
id="fr_5558"></span>[5559](#fn_5558.md) that the service <span
id="fr_5559"></span>[5560](#fn_5559.md) of these gifts should be in the
body, <span id="fr_5560"></span>[5561](#fn_5560.md) nor did He place them
in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love <span
id="fr_5561"></span>[5562](#fn_5561.md) above all these gifts, He even
taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment, <span
id="fr_5562"></span>[5563](#fn_5562.md) just as Christ has shown it to be:
“Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul, <span
id="fr_5563"></span>[5564](#fn_5563.md) with all thy strength, and with all
thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.” <span
id="fr_5564"></span>[5565](#fn_5564.md) When he mentions the fact that “*it
is written in the law*,” <span id="fr_5565"></span>[5566](#fn_5565.md) how
that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst
confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot
be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his
reference to the Creator’s prediction. <span
id="fr_5566"></span>[5567](#fn_5566.md) In precisely the same manner, <span
id="fr_5567"></span>[5568](#fn_5567.md) when enjoining on women silence in
the church, that they speak not for the mere sake <span
id="fr_5568"></span>[5569](#fn_5568.md) of learning <span
id="fr_5569"></span>[5570](#fn_5569.md) (although that even they have the
right of prophesying, he has already shown <span
id="fr_5570"></span>[5571](#fn_5570.md) when he covers the woman that
prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman
should be under obedience. <span id="fr_5571"></span>[5572](#fn_5571.md)
Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other
acquaintance with, than to destroy it. But that we may now leave the
subject of spiritual gifts, facts themselves will be enough to prove
which of us acts rashly in claiming them for his God, and whether it is
possible that they are opposed to our side, even if <span
id="fr_5572"></span>[5573](#fn_5572.md) the Creator promised them for His
Christ who is not yet revealed, as being destined only for the Jews, to
have their operations in His time, in His Christ, and among His people.
Let Marcion <span id="page_447">p. 447</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.viii-Page_447"></span>then exhibit, as gifts of his god,
some prophets, such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the
Spirit of God, such as have both predicted things to come, and have made
manifest <span id="fr_5573"></span>[5574](#fn_5573.md) the secrets of the
heart; <span id="fr_5574"></span>[5575](#fn_5574.md) let him produce a
psalm, a vision, a prayer <span id="fr_5575"></span>[5576](#fn_5575.md)
—only let it be by the Spirit, <span
id="fr_5576"></span>[5577](#fn_5576.md) in an ecstasy, that is, in a
rapture, <span id="fr_5577"></span>[5578](#fn_5577.md) whenever an
interpretation of tongues has occurred to him; let him show to me also,
that any woman of boastful tongue <span
id="fr_5578"></span>[5579](#fn_5578.md) in his community has ever
prophesied from amongst those specially holy sisters of his. Now all
these signs (of spiritual gifts) are forthcoming from my side without
any difficulty, and they agree, too, with the rules, and the
dispensations, and the instructions of the Creator; therefore without
doubt the Christ, and the Spirit, and the apostle, belong
severally <span id="fr_5579"></span>[5580](#fn_5579.md) to my God. Here,
then, is my frank avowal for any one who cares to require it.
