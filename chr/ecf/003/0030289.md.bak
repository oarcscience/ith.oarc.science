<span id="v.iii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—The Apostles Not Ignorant.
The Heretical Pretence of St. Peter’s Imperfection Because He Was
Rebuked by St. Paul. St. Peter Not Rebuked for Error in Teaching.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxiii-p2"></span>Now, with the view of branding <span
id="fr_2090"></span>[2091](#fn_2090.md) the apostles with some mark of
ignorance, they put forth the case of Peter and them that were with him
having been rebuked by Paul. “Something therefore,” they say, “was
wanting in them.” (This they allege,) in order that they may from this
construct that other position of theirs, that a fuller knowledge may
possibly have afterwards come over (the apostles,) such as fell to the
share of Paul when he rebuked those who preceded him. I may here say to
those who reject *The Acts of the Apostles*: “It is first necessary that
you show us who this Paul was,—both what he was before he was an
apostle, and how he became an apostle,”—so very great is the use which
they make of him in respect of other <span id="page_254">p. 254</span>
<span id="v.iii.xxiii-Page_254"></span>questions also. It is true that
he tells us himself that he was a persecutor before he became an
apostle, <span id="fr_2091"></span>[2092](#fn_2091.md) still this is not
enough for any man who examines before he believes, since even the Lord
Himself did not bear witness of Himself. <span
id="fr_2092"></span>[2093](#fn_2092.md) But let them believe without the
Scriptures, if their object is to believe contrary to the
Scriptures. <span id="fr_2093"></span>[2094](#fn_2093.md) Still they should
show, from the circumstance which they allege of Peter’s being rebuked
by Paul, that Paul added yet another form of the gospel besides that
which Peter and the rest had previously set forth. But the fact
is, <span id="fr_2094"></span>[2095](#fn_2094.md) having been converted
from a persecutor to a preacher, he is introduced as one of the brethren
to brethren, by brethren—to them, indeed, by men who had put on faith
from the apostles’ hands.  Afterwards, as he himself narrates, he “went
up to Jerusalem for the purpose of seeing Peter,” <span
id="fr_2095"></span>[2096](#fn_2095.md) because of his office, no
doubt, <span id="fr_2096"></span>[2097](#fn_2096.md) and by right of a
common belief and preaching.  Now they certainly would not have been
surprised at his having become a preacher instead of a persecutor, if
his preaching were of something contrary; nor, moreover, would they have
“glorified the Lord,” <span id="fr_2097"></span>[2098](#fn_2097.md) because
Paul had presented himself as an adversary to Him. They accordingly even
gave him “the right hand of fellowship,” <span
id="fr_2098"></span>[2099](#fn_2098.md) as a sign of their agreement with
him, and arranged amongst themselves a distribution of office, not a
diversity of gospel, so that they should severally preach not a
different gospel, but (the same), to different persons, <span
id="fr_2099"></span>[2100](#fn_2099.md) Peter to the circumcision, Paul to
the Gentiles. Forasmuch, then, as Peter was rebuked because, after he
had lived with the Gentiles, he proceeded to separate himself from their
company out of respect for persons, the fault surely was one of
conversation, not of preaching. <span
id="fr_2100"></span>[2101](#fn_2100.md) For it does not appear from this,
that any other God than the Creator, or any other Christ than (the son)
of Mary, or any other hope than the resurrection, was (by him)
announced.
