<span id="v.iv.v.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—Moses, Allowing Divorce,
and Christ Prohibiting It, Explained. John Baptist and Herod. Marcion’s
Attempt to Discover an Antithesis in the Parable of the Rich Man and the
Poor Man in Hades Confuted. The Creator’s Appointment Manifested in Both
States.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxxiv-p2"></span>But Christ prohibits divorce, saying,
“Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth
adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband,
also committeth adultery.” <span id="fr_4802"></span>[4803](#fn_4802.md) In
order to forbid divorce, He makes it unlawful to marry a woman that has
been put away. Moses, however, permitted repudiation in Deuteronomy:
“When a man hath taken a wife, and hath lived with her, and it come to
pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found
unchastity in her; then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give
it in her hand, and send her away out of his house.” <span
id="fr_4803"></span>[4804](#fn_4803.md) You see, therefore, that there is a
difference between the law and the gospel—between Moses and
Christ? <span id="fr_4804"></span>[4805](#fn_4804.md) To be sure there
is! <span id="fr_4805"></span>[4806](#fn_4805.md) But then you have
rejected that other gospel which witnesses to the same verity and the
same Christ. <span id="fr_4806"></span>[4807](#fn_4806.md) There, while
prohibiting divorce, He has given us a solution of this special question
respecting it: “Moses,” says He, “because of the hardness of your
hearts, suffered you to give a bill of divorcement; but from the
beginning it was not so” <span id="fr_4807"></span>[4808](#fn_4807.md) —for
this reason, indeed, because He who had “made them male and female” had
likewise said, “They twain shall become one flesh; what therefore God
hath joined together, let not man put asunder.” <span
id="fr_4808"></span>[4809](#fn_4808.md) Now, by this answer of His (to the
Pharisees), He both sanctioned the provision of Moses, who was His own
(servant), and restored to its primitive purpose <span
id="fr_4809"></span>[4810](#fn_4809.md) the institution of the Creator,
whose Christ He was. Since, however, you are to be refuted out of the
Scriptures which you have received, I will meet you on your own ground,
as if your Christ were mine. When, therefore, He prohibited divorce, and
yet at the same time represented <span
id="fr_4810"></span>[4811](#fn_4810.md) the Father, even Him who united
male and female, must He not have rather exculpated <span
id="fr_4811"></span>[4812](#fn_4811.md) than abolished the enactment of
Moses?  But, observe, if this Christ be yours when he teaches contrary
to Moses and the Creator, on the same principle must He be mine if I can
show that <span id="page_405">p. 405</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxxiv-Page_405"></span>His teaching is not contrary to them.
I maintain, then, that there was a condition in the prohibition which He
now made of divorce; the case supposed being, that a man put away his
wife for the express purpose of <span
id="fr_4812"></span>[4813](#fn_4812.md) marrying another. His words are:
“Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth
adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband,
also committeth adultery,” <span id="fr_4813"></span>[4814](#fn_4813.md)
—“put away,” that is, for the reason wherefore a woman ought not to be
dismissed, that another wife may be obtained. For he who marries a woman
who is unlawfully put away is as much of an adulterer as the man who
marries one who is un-divorced.  Permanent is the marriage which is not
rightly dissolved; to marry, <span id="fr_4814"></span>[4815](#fn_4814.md)
therefore, whilst matrimony is undissolved, is to commit adultery.
Since, therefore, His prohibition of divorce was a conditional one, He
did not prohibit absolutely; and what He did not absolutely forbid, that
He permitted on some occasions, <span
id="fr_4815"></span>[4816](#fn_4815.md) when there is an absence of the
cause why He gave His prohibition. In very deed <span
id="fr_4816"></span>[4817](#fn_4816.md) His teaching is not contrary to
Moses, whose precept He partially <span
id="fr_4817"></span>[4818](#fn_4817.md) defends, I will not <span
id="fr_4818"></span>[4819](#fn_4818.md) say confirms. If, however, you deny
that divorce is in any way permitted by Christ, how is it that you on
your side <span id="fr_4819"></span>[4820](#fn_4819.md) destroy marriage,
not uniting man and woman, nor admitting to the sacrament of baptism and
of the eucharist those who have been united in marriage anywhere
else, <span id="fr_4820"></span>[4821](#fn_4820.md) unless they should
agree together to repudiate the fruit of their marriage, and so the very
Creator Himself? Well, then, what is a husband to do in your sect, <span
id="fr_4821"></span>[4822](#fn_4821.md) if his wife commit adultery? Shall
he keep her? But your own apostle, you know, <span
id="fr_4822"></span>[4823](#fn_4822.md) does not permit “the members of
Christ to be joined to a harlot.” <span
id="fr_4823"></span>[4824](#fn_4823.md) Divorce, therefore, when justly
deserved, <span id="fr_4824"></span>[4825](#fn_4824.md) has even in Christ
a defender. So that Moses for the future must be considered as being
confirmed by Him, since he prohibits divorce in the same sense as Christ
does, if any unchastity should occur in the wife. For in the Gospel of
Matthew he says, “Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the
cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery.” <span
id="fr_4825"></span>[4826](#fn_4825.md) He also is deemed equally guilty of
adultery, who marries a woman put away by her husband.  The Creator,
however, except on account of adultery, does not put asunder what He
Himself joined together, the same Moses in another passage enacting that
he who had married after violence to a damsel, should thenceforth not
have it in his power to put away his wife. <span
id="fr_4826"></span>[4827](#fn_4826.md) Now, if a compulsory marriage
contracted after violence shall be permanent, how much rather shall a
voluntary one, the result of agreement! This has the sanction of the
prophet: “Thou shalt not forsake the wife of thy youth.” <span
id="fr_4827"></span>[4828](#fn_4827.md) Thus you have Christ following
spontaneously the tracks of the Creator everywhere, both in permitting
divorce and in forbidding it. You find Him also protecting marriage, in
whatever direction you try to escape. He prohibits divorce when He will
have the marriage inviolable; He permits divorce when the marriage is
spotted with unfaithfulness. You should blush when you refuse to unite
those whom even your Christ has united; and repeat the blush when you
disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would have them
separated. I have <span id="fr_4828"></span>[4829](#fn_4828.md) now to show
whence the Lord derived this decision <span
id="fr_4829"></span>[4830](#fn_4829.md) of His, and to what end He directed
it.  It will thus become more fully evident that His object was not the
abolition of the Mosaic ordinance <span
id="fr_4830"></span>[4831](#fn_4830.md) by any suddenly devised proposal of
divorce; because it was not suddenly proposed, but had its root in the
previously mentioned John. For John reproved Herod, because he had
illegally married the wife of his deceased brother, who had a daughter
by her (a union which the law permitted only on the one occasion of the
brother dying childless, <span id="fr_4831"></span>[4832](#fn_4831.md) when
it even prescribed such a marriage, in order that by his own brother,
and from his own wife, <span id="fr_4832"></span>[4833](#fn_4832.md) seed
might be reckoned to the deceased husband), <span
id="fr_4833"></span>[4834](#fn_4833.md) and was in consequence cast into
prison, and finally, by the same Herod, was even put to death. The Lord
having therefore made mention of John, and of course of the occurrence
of his death, hurled His censure <span
id="fr_4834"></span>[4835](#fn_4834.md) against Herod in the form of
unlawful marriages and of adultery, pronouncing as an adulterer even the
man who married a woman that had been put away from her husband. This he
said in order the more severely to load Herod with guilt, who had taken
his brother’s wife, after she had been loosed from her husband not less
by death than by divorce; who had been impelled <span id="page_406">p.
406</span> <span id="v.iv.v.xxxiv-Page_406"></span>thereto by his lust,
not by the prescription of the (Levirate) law—for, as his brother had
left a daughter, the marriage with the widow could not be lawful on that
very account; <span id="fr_4835"></span>[4836](#fn_4835.md) and who, when
the prophet asserted against him the law, had therefore put him to
death. The remarks I have advanced on this case will be also of use to
me in illustrating the subsequent parable of the rich man <span
id="fr_4836"></span>[4837](#fn_4836.md) tormented in hell, and the poor man
resting in Abraham’s bosom. <span id="fr_4837"></span>[4838](#fn_4837.md)
For this passage, so far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly;
but if we regard its sense and purport, it naturally <span
id="fr_4838"></span>[4839](#fn_4838.md) fits in with the mention of John
wickedly slain, and of Herod, who had been condemned by him for his
impious marriage. <span id="fr_4839"></span>[4840](#fn_4839.md) It sets
forth in bold outline <span id="fr_4840"></span>[4841](#fn_4840.md) the end
of both of them, the “torments” of Herod and the “comfort” of John, that
even now Herod might hear that warning:  “They have there Moses and the
prophets, let them hear them.” <span
id="fr_4841"></span>[4842](#fn_4841.md) Marcion, however, violently turns
the passage to another end, and decides that both the torment and the
comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life <span
id="fr_4842"></span>[4843](#fn_4842.md) for those who have obeyed the law
and the prophets; whilst he defines the heavenly bosom and harbour to
belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the
Scripture itself which dazzles <span
id="fr_4843"></span>[4844](#fn_4843.md) his sight expressly distinguishes
between Abraham’s bosom, where the poor man dwells, and the infernal
place of torment.  “Hell” (I take it) means one thing, and “Abraham’s
bosom” another. “A great gulf” is said to separate those regions, and to
hinder a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not
have “lifted up his eyes,” <span id="fr_4844"></span>[4845](#fn_4844.md)
and from a distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said
distance all up through the vast immensity of height and depth. It must
therefore be evident to every man of intelligence who has ever heard of
the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place called
Abraham’s bosom, and that it is designed for the reception of the souls
of Abraham’s children, even from among the Gentiles (since he is “the
father of many nations,” which must be classed amongst his family), and
of the same faith as that wherewithal he himself believed God, without
the yoke of the law and the sign of circumcision. This region,
therefore, I call Abraham’s bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is
yet higher than hell, <span id="fr_4845"></span>[4846](#fn_4845.md) and is
appointed to afford an interval of rest to the souls of the righteous,
until the consummation of all things shall complete the resurrection of
all men with the “full recompense of their reward.” <span
id="fr_4846"></span>[4847](#fn_4846.md) This consummation will then be
manifested in heavenly promises, which Marcion, however, claims for his
own god, just as if the Creator had never announced them.  Amos,
however, tells us of “those stories towards heaven” <span
id="fr_4847"></span>[4848](#fn_4847.md) which Christ “builds”—of course for
His people.  There also is that everlasting abode of which Isaiah asks,
“Who shall declare unto you *the eternal place*, but He (that is, of
course, Christ) who walketh in righteousness, speaketh of the straight
path, hateth injustice and iniquity?” <span
id="fr_4848"></span>[4849](#fn_4848.md) Now, although this everlasting
abode is promised, and the ascending stories (or steps) to heaven are
built by the Creator, who further promises that the seed of Abraham
shall be even as the stars of heaven, by virtue certainly of the
heavenly promise, why may it not be possible, <span
id="fr_4849"></span>[4850](#fn_4849.md) without any injury to that promise,
that by Abraham’s bosom is meant some temporary receptacle of faithful
souls, wherein is even now delineated an image of the future, and where
is given some foresight of the glory <span
id="fr_4850"></span>[4851](#fn_4850.md) of both judgments? If so, you have
here, O heretics, during your present lifetime, a warning that Moses and
the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His only Christ, and
how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal salvation
rest with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive.  Well,
but the admonition, says *Marcion*, of our God from heaven has commanded
us not to hear Moses and the prophets, but Christ; Hear Him *is the
command*. <span id="fr_4851"></span>[4852](#fn_4851.md) This is true
enough. For the apostles had by that time sufficiently heard Moses and
the prophets, for they had followed Christ, being persuaded by Moses and
the prophets. For even Peter would not have been able <span
id="fr_4852"></span>[4853](#fn_4852.md) to say, “Thou art the
Christ,” <span id="fr_4853"></span>[4854](#fn_4853.md) unless he had
beforehand heard and believed Moses and the prophets, by whom alone
Christ had been hitherto announced.  Their faith, indeed, had deserved
this confirmation by such a voice from heaven as should bid them *hear*
<span id="page_407">p. 407</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxxiv-Page_407"></span>*Him*, whom they had recognized as
preaching peace, announcing glad tidings, promising an everlasting
abode, building for them steps upwards into heaven. <span
id="fr_4854"></span>[4855](#fn_4854.md) Down in hell, however, it was said
concerning them: “They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear
them!”—even those who did not believe them or at least did not
sincerely <span id="fr_4855"></span>[4856](#fn_4855.md) believe that after
death there were punishments for the arrogance of wealth and the glory
of luxury, announced indeed by Moses and the prophets, but decreed by
that God, who deposes princes from their thrones, and raiseth up the
poor from dunghills. <span id="fr_4856"></span>[4857](#fn_4856.md) Since,
therefore, it is quite consistent in the Creator to pronounce different
sentences in the two directions *of reward and punishment*, we shall
have to conclude that there is here no diversity of gods, <span
id="fr_4857"></span>[4858](#fn_4857.md) but only a difference in the actual
matters <span id="fr_4858"></span>[4859](#fn_4858.md) before us.
