<span id="vi.iv.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Of the Power of Prayer.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxix-p2"></span>For what has God, who exacts it *ever*
denied <span id="fr_8944"></span>[8945](#fn_8944.md) to prayer coming from
“spirit and truth?”  How mighty specimens of its efficacy do we read,
and hear, and believe! *Old-world* prayer, indeed, used to free from
fires, <span id="fr_8945"></span>[8946](#fn_8945.md) and from beasts, <span
id="fr_8946"></span>[8947](#fn_8946.md) and from famine; <span
id="fr_8947"></span>[8948](#fn_8947) and yet it had not (then.md) received
its form from Christ. But how far more amply operative is *Christian*
prayer! It does not station the angel of dew <span id="page_691">p.
691</span> <span id="vi.iv.xxix-Page_691"></span>in mid-fires, <span
id="fr_8948"></span>[8949](#fn_8948.md) nor muzzle lions, nor transfer to
the hungry the rustics’ bread; <span
id="fr_8949"></span>[8950](#fn_8949.md) it has no delegated grace to avert
any sense of suffering; <span id="fr_8950"></span>[8951](#fn_8950.md) but
it supplies the suffering, and the feeling, and the grieving, with
endurance: it amplifies grace by virtue, that faith may know what she
obtains from the Lord, understanding what—for God’s name’s sake—she
suffers. But in days gone by, withal prayer used to call down <span
id="fr_8951"></span>[8952](#fn_8951.md) plagues, scatter the armies of
foes, withhold the wholesome influences of the showers. Now, however,
the prayer of righteousness averts all God’s anger, keeps bivouac on
behalf of personal enemies, makes supplication on behalf of persecutors.
Is it wonder if *it* knows how to extort the *rains* of heaven <span
id="fr_8952"></span>[8953](#fn_8952) —(prayer.md) which was *once* able to
procure its *fires*? <span id="fr_8953"></span>[8954](#fn_8953.md) Prayer
is alone that which vanquishes <span
id="fr_8954"></span>[8955](#fn_8954.md) God. But Christ has willed that it
be operative for no evil: He had conferred on it all its virtue in the
cause of good.  And so it knows nothing save how to recall the souls of
the departed from the very path of death, to transform the weak, to
restore the sick, to purge the possessed, to open prison-bars, to loose
the bonds of the innocent. Likewise it washes away faults, repels
temptations, extinguishes persecutions, consoles the faint-spirited,
cheers the high-spirited, escorts travellers, appeases waves, makes
robbers stand aghast, nourishes the poor, governs the rich, upraises the
fallen, arrests the falling, confirms the standing. Prayer is the wall
of faith: her arms and missiles <span
id="fr_8955"></span>[8956](#fn_8955.md) against the foe who keeps watch
over us on all sides. And, so never walk we unarmed. By day, be we
mindful of Station; by night, of vigil. Under the arms of prayer guard
we the standard of our General; await we in prayer the angel’s
trump. <span id="fr_8956"></span>[8957](#fn_8956.md) The angels, likewise,
all pray; every creature prays; cattle and wild beasts pray and bend
their knees; and when they issue from their layers and lairs, <span
id="fr_8957"></span>[8958](#fn_8957.md) they look up heavenward with no
idle mouth, making their breath vibrate <span
id="fr_8958"></span>[8959](#fn_8958.md) after their own manner. Nay, the
birds too, rising out of the nest, upraise themselves heavenward, and,
instead of hands, expand the cross of their wings, and say somewhat to
seem like prayer. <span id="fr_8959"></span>[8960](#fn_8959.md) What more
then, touching the office of prayer? Even the Lord Himself prayed; to
whom be honour and virtue unto the ages of the ages!

corpus pondere suo fertur ad ima. Sic disciplinam Christi, sic suave
jugum, sic onus leve, quo deponimus, eo deprimimur ipsi:  quia portat
potius quam portatur.” Epistola, ccclxxxv. Bernardi Opp. Tom. i. p. 691.
Ed. (Mabillon.) Gaume, Paris, 1839. Bearing the cross uplifts the
Christian.\]
