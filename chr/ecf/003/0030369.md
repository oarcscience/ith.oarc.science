<span id="v.iv.iii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—God’s Dealings with Adam at
the Fall, and with Cain After His Crime, Admirably Explained and
Defended.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xxv-p2"></span>It is now high time that I should, in
order to meet all <span id="fr_3015"></span>[3016](#fn_3015.md) objections
of this kind, proceed to the explanation and clearing up <span
id="fr_3016"></span>[3017](#fn_3016.md) of the other trifles, <span
id="fr_3017"></span>[3018](#fn_3017.md) weak points, and inconsistencies,
as you deemed them. God calls out to Adam, <span
id="fr_3018"></span>[3019](#fn_3018.md) Where art thou? as if ignorant
where he was; and when he alleged that the shame of his nakedness was
the cause (of his hiding himself), He inquired whether he had eaten of
the tree, as if He were in doubt.  By no means; <span
id="fr_3019"></span>[3020](#fn_3019.md) God was neither uncertain about the
commission of the sin, nor ignorant of Adam’s whereabouts. It was
certainly proper to summon the offender, who was concealing himself from
the consciousness of his sin, and to bring him forth into the presence
of his Lord, not merely by the calling out of his name, but <span
id="page_317">p. 317</span> <span id="v.iv.iii.xxv-Page_317"></span>with
a home-thrust blow <span id="fr_3020"></span>[3021](#fn_3020.md) at the sin
which he had at that moment committed. For the question ought not to be
read in a merely interrogative tone, Where art thou, Adam? but with an
impressive and earnest voice, and with an air of imputation, Oh, Adam,
*where* art thou?—as much as to intimate: thou art no longer here, thou
art in perdition—so that the voice is the utterance of One who is at
once rebuking and sorrowing. <span id="fr_3021"></span>[3022](#fn_3021.md)
But of course some part of paradise had escaped the eye of Him who holds
the universe in His hand as if it were a bird’s nest, and to whom heaven
is a throne and earth a footstool; so that He could not see, before He
summoned him forth, where Adam was, both while lurking and when eating
of the forbidden fruit!  The wolf or the paltry thief escapes not the
notice of the keeper of your vineyard or your garden! And God, I
suppose, with His keener vision, <span
id="fr_3022"></span>[3023](#fn_3022.md) from on high was unable to miss the
sight of <span id="fr_3023"></span>[3024](#fn_3023.md) aught which lay
beneath Him! Foolish heretic, who treat with scorn <span
id="fr_3024"></span>[3025](#fn_3024.md) so fine an argument of God’s
greatness and man’s instruction! God put the question with an appearance
of uncertainty, in order that even here He might prove man to be the
subject of a free will in the alternative of either a denial or a
confession, and give to him the opportunity of freely acknowledging his
transgression, and, so far, <span id="fr_3025"></span>[3026](#fn_3025.md)
of lightening it. <span id="fr_3026"></span>[3027](#fn_3026.md) In like
manner He inquires of Cain where his brother was, just as if He had not
yet heard the blood of Abel crying from the ground, in order that he too
might have the opportunity from the same power of the will of
spontaneously denying, and to this degree aggravating, his crime; and
that thus there might be supplied to us examples of confessing sins
rather than of denying them: so that even then was initiated the
evangelic doctrine, “By thy words <span
id="fr_3027"></span>[3028](#fn_3027.md) thou shalt be justified, and by thy
words thou shalt be condemned.” <span
id="fr_3028"></span>[3029](#fn_3028.md) Now, although Adam was by reason of
his condition under law <span id="fr_3029"></span>[3030](#fn_3029.md)
subject to death, yet was hope preserved to him by the Lord’s saying,
“Behold, Adam is become as one of us;” <span
id="fr_3030"></span>[3031](#fn_3030.md) that is, in consequence of the
future taking of the man into the divine nature. Then what follows? “And
now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, (and
eat), and live for ever.” Inserting thus the particle of present time,
“And now,” He shows that He had made for a time, and at present, a
prolongation of man’s life. Therefore He did not actually <span
id="fr_3031"></span>[3032](#fn_3031.md) curse Adam and Eve, for they were
candidates for restoration, and they had been relieved <span
id="fr_3032"></span>[3033](#fn_3032.md) by confession. Cain, however, He
not only cursed; but when he wished to atone for his sin by death, He
even prohibited his dying, so that he had to bear the load of this
prohibition in addition to his crime. This, then, will prove to be the
ignorance of our God, which was simulated on this account, that
delinquent man should not be unaware of what he ought to do. Coming down
to the case of Sodom and Gomorrha, he says: “I will go down now, and see
whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is
come unto me; and if not, I will know.” <span
id="fr_3033"></span>[3034](#fn_3033.md) Well, was He in this instance also
uncertain through ignorance, and desiring to know?  Or was this a
necessary tone of utterance, as expressive of a minatory and not a
dubious sense, under the colour of an inquiry? If you make merry at
God’s “going down,” as if He could not except by the descent have
accomplished His judgment, take care that you do not strike your own God
with as hard a blow. For He also came down to accomplish what He wished.
