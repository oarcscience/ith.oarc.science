<span id="v.v.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Earth Does Not Mean Matter as
Hermogenes Would Have It.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxiv-p2"></span>I now return to the several points <span
id="fr_6353"></span>[6354](#fn_6353) by means of which he thought that
Matter was signified. And first I will inquire about the <span
id="page_491">p. 491</span> <span id="v.v.xxiv-Page_491"></span>terms.
For we read only of one of them, *Earth*; the other, namely *Matter*, we
do not meet with. I ask, then, since Matter is not mentioned in
Scripture, how the term earth can be applied to it, which marks a
substance of another kind? There is all the greater need why mention
should also have been made of Matter, if this has acquired the further
sense of Earth, in order that I may be sure that Earth is one and the
same name as Matter, and so not claim the designation for merely one
substance, as the proper name thereof, and by which it is better known;
or else be unable (if I should feel the inclination), to apply it to
some particular species of Matter, instead, indeed, <span
id="fr_6354"></span>[6355](#fn_6354) of making it the common term <span
id="fr_6355"></span>[6356](#fn_6355) of all Matter. For when a proper
name does not exist for that thing to which a common term is ascribed,
the less apparent <span id="fr_6356"></span>[6357](#fn_6356) is the
object to which it may be ascribed, *the more* capable will it be of
being applied to any other object whatever. Therefore, even supposing
that Hermogenes could show us the *name* <span
id="fr_6357"></span>[6358](#fn_6357) Matter, he is bound to prove to us
further, that the same object has the *surname* <span
id="fr_6358"></span>[6359](#fn_6358) Earth, in order that he may claim
for it both designations alike.

<span id="v.v.xxiv-p6"></span> We have construed Oehler’s reading:
“Quanto non comparet” (*i.e.*, by a frequent ellipse of Tertullian,
“quanto *magis* non comparet”). Fr. Junius, however, suspects that
instead of “quanto” we should read “quando”: this would produce the
sense, “since it is not apparent to what object it may be ascribed,”
etc.
