<span id="vi.iii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Unity of Baptism. Remarks on
Heretical And Jewish Baptism.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xv-p2"></span>I know not whether any further point is
mooted to bring baptism into controversy. Permit me to call to mind what
I have omitted above, lest I seem to break off the train of impending
thoughts in the middle. There is to us one, and but one, baptism; as
well according to the Lord’s gospel <span
id="fr_8688"></span>[8689](#fn_8688) as according to the apostle’s
letters, <span id="fr_8689"></span>[8690](#fn_8689) inasmuch as *he
says*, “One God, and one baptism, and one church in the heavens.” <span
id="fr_8690"></span>[8691](#fn_8690) But it must be admitted that the
question, “What rules are to be observed with regard to heretics?” is
worthy of being treated. For it is to *us* <span
id="fr_8691"></span>[8692](#fn_8691) that that assertion <span
id="fr_8692"></span>[8693](#fn_8692) refers. Heretics, however, have no
fellowship in our discipline, whom the mere fact of their
excommunication <span id="fr_8693"></span>[8694](#fn_8693) testifies to
be outsiders. I am not bound to recognize in *them* a thing which is
enjoined on *me*, because they and we have not the same God, nor
one—that is, *the same*—Christ. And therefore their baptism is not one
*with ours* either, because it is not *the same; a baptism* which, since
they have it not duly, doubtless they have *not at all*; nor is that
capable of being *counted* which is not *had*. <span
id="fr_8694"></span>[8695](#fn_8694) Thus they cannot *receive* it
either, because they *have it not*. But this point has already received
a fuller discussion from us in Greek.  We enter, then, the font <span
id="fr_8695"></span>[8696](#fn_8695) *once:  once* are sins washed away,
because they ought never to be repeated. But the Jewish Israel bathes
daily, <span id="fr_8696"></span>[8697](#fn_8696) because he is daily
being defiled: and, for fear that *defilement* should be practised among
*us* also, therefore was the definition touching the one bathing <span
id="fr_8697"></span>[8698](#fn_8697) made. Happy water, which *once*
washes away; which does not mock sinners (with vain hopes); which does
not, by <span id="page_677">p. 677</span> <span
id="vi.iii.xv-Page_677"></span>being infected with the repetition of
impurities, again defile them whom it has washed!
