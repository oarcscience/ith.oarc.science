<span id="v.iii.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Comparative Lateness of
Heresies. Marcion’s Heresy. Some Personal Facts About Him. The Heresy of
Apelles. Character of This Man; Philumene; Valentinus; Nigidius, and
Hermogenes.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxx-p2"></span>Where was Marcion *then*, that shipmaster
of Pontus, the zealous student of Stoicism? Where was Valentinus *then*,
the disciple of Platonism? For it is evident that those men lived not so
long ago,—in the reign of Antoninus for the most part, <span
id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155) —and that they at first were
believers in the doctrine of the Catholic Church, in the church of Rome
under the episcopate of the blessed Eleutherus, <span
id="fr_2156"></span>[2157](#fn_2156) until on account of their ever
restless curiosity, with which they even infected the brethren, they
were more than once expelled. Marcion, indeed, \[went\] with the two
hundred sesterces which he had brought into the church, and, <span
id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157) when banished at last to a
permanent excommunication, they scattered abroad the poisons of their
doctrines. Afterwards, it is true, Marcion professed repentance, and
agreed to the conditions granted to him—that he should receive
reconciliation if he restored to the church all the others whom he had
been training for perdition: he was prevented, however, by death. It was
indeed <span id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158) necessary that there
should be heresies; <span id="fr_2159"></span>[2160](#fn_2159) and yet
it does not follow from that necessity, that heresies are a good thing.
As if it has not been necessary also that there should be evil! It was
even necessary that the Lord should be betrayed; but woe to the
traitor! <span id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160) So that no man may
from this defend heresies. If we must likewise touch the descent <span
id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161) of Apelles, he is far from being
“one of the old school,” <span id="fr_2162"></span>[2163](#fn_2162) like
his instructor and moulder, Marcion; he rather forsook the continence of
Marcion, by resorting to the company of a woman, and withdrew to
Alexandria, out of sight of his most abstemious <span
id="fr_2163"></span>[2164](#fn_2163) master. Returning therefrom, after
some years, unimproved, except that he was no longer a Marcionite, he
clave <span id="fr_2164"></span>[2165](#fn_2164) to another woman, the
maiden Philumene (whom we have already <span
id="fr_2165"></span>[2166](#fn_2165) mentioned), who herself afterwards
became an enormous prostitute. Having been imposed on by her vigorous
spirit, <span id="fr_2166"></span>[2167](#fn_2166) he committed to
writing *the revelations* which he had learned of her. Persons are still
living who remember them,—their own actual disciples and successors,—who
cannot therefore deny the lateness of their date. But, in fact, by their
own works they are convicted, even as the Lord said. <span
id="fr_2167"></span>[2168](#fn_2167) For since Marcion separated the New
Testament from the Old, he is (necessarily) subsequent to that which he
separated, inasmuch as it was only in his power to separate what was
(previously) united. Having then been united previous to its separation,
the fact of its subsequent separation proves the subsequence also of the
man who effected the separation.  In like manner Valentinus, by his
different expositions and acknowledged <span
id="fr_2168"></span>[2169](#fn_2168) emendations, makes these changes on
the express ground of previous faultiness, and therefore demonstrates
the difference <span id="fr_2169"></span>[2170](#fn_2169) of the
documents. These corrupters of the truth we mention as being more
notorious and more public <span id="fr_2170"></span>[2171](#fn_2170)
than others. There is, however, a certain man <span
id="fr_2171"></span>[2172](#fn_2171) named Nigidius, and Hermogenes, and
several others, who still pursue the course <span
id="fr_2172"></span>[2173](#fn_2172) of perverting the ways of the Lord.
Let them show me by what authority they come!  If it be some other God
they preach, how comes it that they employ the things and the writings
and the names of that God against whom they preach? If it be the same
God, why treat Him in some other way? Let them prove themselves to be
new apostles! <span id="fr_2173"></span>[2174](#fn_2173) Let them
maintain that Christ has come down a second time, taught in person a
second time, has been twice crucified, twice dead, twice raised! For
thus has the apostle described (the order of events in the life of
Christ); for thus, too, is He <span id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174)
accustomed to make His apostles—to give them, (that is), power besides
of working the same miracles which He worked Himself. <span
id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175) I would therefore have their mighty
deeds also brought forward; except that I allow their <span
id="page_258">p. 258</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxx-Page_258"></span>mightiest deed to be that by which they
perversely vie with the apostles.  For whilst they used to raise men to
life from the dead, these consign men to death from their living state.

passage: “Sic enim apostolus descripsit, sic enim apostolos solet
facere, dare præterea illis virtutem eadem signa edendi quæ et ipse.”
\[“It is worthy of remark” (says Kaye, p. 95), “that he does not appeal
*to any instance* of the exercise of miraculous powers in his own
day.”\]
