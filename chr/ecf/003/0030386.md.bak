<span id="v.iv.iv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Isaiah’s Prophecy of Emmanuel.
Christ Entitled to that Name.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xii-p2"></span>And challenge us first, as is your
wont, to consider Isaiah’s description of Christ, while <span
id="page_331">p. 331</span> <span id="v.iv.iv.xii-Page_331"></span>you
contend that in no point does it suit. For, to begin with, you say that
Isaiah’s Christ will have to be called Emmanuel; <span
id="fr_3250"></span>[3251](#fn_3250.md) then, that He takes the riches of
Damascus and the spoils of Samaria against the king of Assyria. <span
id="fr_3251"></span>[3252](#fn_3251.md) But yet He who is come was neither
born under such a name, nor ever engaged in any warlike enterprise. I
must, however, remind you that you ought to look into the contexts <span
id="fr_3252"></span>[3253](#fn_3252.md) of the two passages. For there is
immediately added the interpretation of Emmanuel, “God with us;” so that
you have to consider not merely the name as it is uttered, but also its
meaning. The utterance is Hebrew, *Emmanuel*, of the prophet’s own
nation; but the meaning of the word, *God with us*, is by the
interpretation made common property. Inquire, then, whether this name,
God-with-us, which is Emmanuel, be not often used for the name of
Christ, <span id="fr_3253"></span>[3254](#fn_3253.md) from the fact that
Christ has enlightened the world. And I suppose you will not deny it,
inasmuch as you do yourself admit that He is called God-with-us, that
is, Emmanuel. Else if you are so foolish, that, because with you He gets
the designation God-with-us, not Emmanuel, you therefore are unwilling
to grant that He is come whose property it is to be called Emmanuel, as
if this were not the same name as God-with-us, you will find among the
Hebrew Christians, and amongst Marcionites too, that they name Him
Emmanuel when they mean Him to be called God-with-us; just indeed as
every nation, by whatever word they would express God-with-us, has
called Him Emmanuel, completing the sound in its sense. Now since
Emmanuel is God-with-us, and God-with-us is Christ, who is in us (for
“as many of you as are baptized into Christ, have put on Christ” <span
id="fr_3254"></span>[3255](#fn_3254) .md), Christ is as properly implied in
the meaning of the name, which is God-with-us, as He is in the
pronunciation of the name, which is Emmanuel. And thus it is evident
that He is now come who was foretold as Emmanuel, because what Emmanuel
signifies is come, that is to say, God-with-us.
