<span id="iv.viii.ii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Inventors of Useful Arts
Unworthy of Deification. They Would Be the First to Acknowledge a
Creator. The Arts Changeable from Time to Time, and Some Become
Obsolete.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xvi-p2"></span>Well, but <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md) certain men have discovered fruits
and sundry necessaries of life, (and hence are worthy of
deification). <span id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md) Now let me ask,
when you call these persons “discoverers,” do you not confess that what
they discovered was already in existence? Why then do you not prefer to
honour the Author, from whom the gifts really come, instead of
converting the Author into *mere* discoverers? Previously he who made
the discover, the inventor himself no doubt expressed his gratitude to
the Author; no doubt, too, he felt that He was God, to whom really
belonged the religious service, <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074) as the Creator (of the gift.md), by
whom also both he who discovered and that which was discovered were
alike created.  The green fig of Africa nobody at Rome had heard of when
Cato introduced it to the Senate, in order that he might show how near
was that province of the enemy <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) whose subjugation he was constantly
urging.  The cherry was first made common in Italy by Cn. Pompey, who
imported it from Pontus. I might possibly have thought the earliest
introducers of apples amongst the Romans deserving of the public
honour <span id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md) of deification. This,
however, would be as foolish a ground for making gods as even the
invention of the useful arts. And yet if the skilful men <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md) of our own time be compared with
these, how much more suitable would deification be to the later
generation than to the former! For, tell me, have not all the extant
inventions superseded antiquity, <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md) whilst daily experience goes on
adding to the new stock? Those, therefore, whom you regard as divine
because of their arts, you are really injuring by your very arts, and
challenging (their divinity) by means of rival attainments, which cannot
be surpassed. <span id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md)
