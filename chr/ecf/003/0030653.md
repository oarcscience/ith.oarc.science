<span id="v.ix.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The Word of God is Also the Wisdom
of God. The Going Forth of Wisdom to Create the Universe, According to
the Divine Plan.</span>

<span id="v.ix.vi-p2"></span>This power and disposition <span
id="fr_7817"></span>[7818](#fn_7817.md) of the Divine Intelligence <span
id="fr_7818"></span>[7819](#fn_7818.md) is set forth also in the Scriptures
under the name of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ix.vi-p4.1"></span>Σοφία</span>, Wisdom; for what can be better
entitled to the name of Wisdom <span
id="fr_7819"></span>[7820](#fn_7819.md) than the Reason or the Word of
God?  Listen therefore to Wisdom herself, constituted in the character
of a Second Person: “At the first the Lord created me as the beginning
of His ways, with a view to His own works, before He made the earth,
before the mountains were settled; moreover, before all the hills did He
beget me;” <span id="fr_7820"></span>[7821](#fn_7820.md) that is to say, He
created and generated me in His own intelligence. Then, again, observe
the distinction between them implied in the companionship of Wisdom with
the Lord. “When He prepared the heaven,” says *Wisdom*, “I was present
with Him; and when He made His strong places upon the winds, which are
the clouds above; and when He secured the fountains, (and all things)
which are beneath the sky, I was by, arranging all things with Him; I
was by, in whom He delighted; and daily, too, did I rejoice in His
presence.” <span id="fr_7821"></span>[7822](#fn_7821.md) Now, as soon as it
pleased God to put forth into their respective substances and forms the
things which He had planned and ordered within Himself, in conjunction
with His Wisdom’s Reason and Word, He first put forth the Word Himself,
having within Him His own inseparable Reason and Wisdom, in order that
all things might be made through Him through whom they had been planned
and disposed, yea, and already made, so far forth as (they were) in the
mind and intelligence of God. This, however, was still wanting to them,
that they should also be openly known, and kept permanently in their
proper forms and substances.
