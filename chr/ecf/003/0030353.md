<span id="v.iv.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Another Cavil Answered, I.e.,
the Fall Imputable to God, Because Man’s Soul is a Portion of the
Spiritual Essence of the Creator.  The Divine Afflatus Not in Fault in
the Sin of Man, But the Human Will Which Was Additional to It.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.ix-p2"></span>But, you say, in what way soever the
substance of the Creator is found to be susceptible of fault, when the
*afflatus* of God, that is to say, the soul, <span
id="fr_2812"></span>[2813](#fn_2812.md) offends in man, it cannot but be
that that fault of the portion is refferible to the original whole. Now,
to meet this objection, we must explain the nature <span
id="fr_2813"></span>[2814](#fn_2813.md) of the soul. We must at the outset
hold fast the meaning of the Greek scripture, which has *afflatus*, not
spirit. <span id="fr_2814"></span>[2815](#fn_2814.md) Some interpreters of
the Greek, without reflecting on the difference of the words, and
careless about their exact meaning, put spirit for *afflatus*; they thus
afford to heretics an opportunity of tarnishing <span
id="fr_2815"></span>[2816](#fn_2815.md) the Spirit of God, that is to say,
God Himself, with default. And now comes the question. *Afflatus*,
observe then, is less than spirit, although it comes from spirit; it is
the spirit’s gentle breeze, <span id="fr_2816"></span>[2817](#fn_2816.md)
but it is not the spirit. Now a breeze is rarer than the wind; and
although it proceeds from wind, yet a breeze is not the wind. One may
call a breeze the image of the spirit. In the same manner, man is the
image of God, that is, of spirit; for God is spirit. *Afflatus* is
therefore the image of the spirit. Now the image is not in any case
equal to the very thing. <span id="fr_2817"></span>[2818](#fn_2817.md) It
is one thing to be like the reality, and another thing to be the reality
itself.  So, although the *afflatus* is the image of the spirit, it is
yet not possible to compare the image of God in such a way, that,
because the reality—that is, the spirit, or in other words, the Divine
Being—is faultless, therefore the *afflatus* also, that is to say, the
image, ought not by any possibility to have done wrong. In this respect
will the image be less than the reality, and the *afflatus* inferior to
the spirit, in that, while it possesses beyond doubt the true lineaments
of divinity, such as an immortal soul, freedom and its own mastery over
itself, foreknowledge in a great degree, <span
id="fr_2818"></span>[2819](#fn_2818.md) reasonableness, capacity of
understanding and knowledge, it is even in these respects an image
still, and never amounts to the actual power of Deity, nor to absolute
exemption from fault,—a property which is only conceded to God, that is,
to the reality, and which is simply incompatible with an image. An
image, although it may express all the lineaments of the reality, is yet
wanting in its intrinsic power; it is destitute of motion. In like
manner, the soul, the image of the spirit, is unable to express the
simple power thereof, that is to say, its happy exemption from
sinning. <span id="fr_2819"></span>[2820](#fn_2819.md) Were it
otherwise, <span id="fr_2820"></span>[2821](#fn_2820.md) it would not be
soul, but spirit; not man, who received a soul, but God. Besides, to
take another view of the matter, <span
id="fr_2821"></span>[2822](#fn_2821.md) not everything which pertains to
God will be regarded as God, so that you would not maintain that His
*afflatus* was God, that is, exempt from fault, because it is the breath
of God.  And in an act of your own, such as blowing into a flute, you
would not thereby make the flute human, although it was your own human
breath which you breathed into it, precisely as God breathed of His own
Spirit. In fact, <span id="fr_2822"></span>[2823](#fn_2822.md) the
Scripture, by expressly saying <span
id="fr_2823"></span>[2824](#fn_2823.md) that God breathed into man’s
nostrils the breath of life, and that man became thereby a living soul,
not a life-giving spirit, has distinguished that *soul* from the
condition of the Creator. The work must <span id="page_305">p.
305</span> <span id="v.iv.iii.ix-Page_305"></span>necessarily be
distinct from the workman, and it is inferior to him.  The pitcher will
not be the potter, although made by the potter; nor in like manner, will
the *afflatus*, because made by the spirit, be on that account the
spirit.  The soul has often been called by the same name as the breath.
You should also take care that no descent be made from the breath to a
still lower quality.  So you have granted (you say) the infirmity of the
soul, which you denied before! Undoubtedly, when you demand for it an
equality with God, that is, a freedom from fault, I contend that it is
infirm. But when the comparison is challenged with an angel, I am
compelled to maintain that the head over all things is the stronger of
the two, to whom the angels are ministers, <span
id="fr_2824"></span>[2825](#fn_2824.md) who is destined to be the judge of
angels, <span id="fr_2825"></span>[2826](#fn_2825.md) if he shall stand
fast in the law of God—an obedience which he refused at first. Now this
disobedience <span id="fr_2826"></span>[2827](#fn_2826.md) it was possible
for the *afflatus* of God to commit: it was possible, but it was not
proper. The *possibility* lay in its slenderness of nature, as being the
breath and not the spirit; the *impropriety*, however, arose from its
power of will, as being free, and not a slave.  It was furthermore
assisted by the warning against committing sin under the threat of
incurring death, which was meant to be a support for its slender nature,
and a direction for its liberty of choice. So that the soul can no
longer appear to have sinned, because it has an affinity with God, that
is to say, through the *afflatus*, but rather through that which was an
addition to its nature, that is, through its free-will, which was indeed
given to it by God in accordance with His purpose and reason, but
recklessly employed <span id="fr_2827"></span>[2828](#fn_2827.md) by man
according as he chose. This, then, being the case, the entire
course <span id="fr_2828"></span>[2829](#fn_2828.md) of God’s action is
purged from all imputation to evil. For the liberty of the will will not
retort its own wrong on Him by whom it was bestowed, but on him by whom
it was improperly used. What is the evil, then, which you want to impute
to the Creator?  If it is man’s sin, it will not be God’s fault, because
it is man’s doing; nor is that Being to be regarded as the author of the
sin, who turns out to be its forbidder, nay, its condemner.  If death is
the evil, death will not give the reproach of being its own author to
Him who threatened it, but to him who despised it. For by his contempt
he introduced it, which assuredly <span
id="fr_2829"></span>[2830](#fn_2829.md) would not have appeared had man not
despised it.
