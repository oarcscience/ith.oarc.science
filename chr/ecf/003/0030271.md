<span id="v.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Heresy, as Well as Schism and
Dissension, Disapproved by St. Paul, Who Speaks of the Necessity of
Heresies, Not as a Good, But, by the Will of God, Salutary Trials for
Training and Approving the Faith of Christians.</span>

<span id="v.iii.v-p2"></span>Moreover, when he blames dissensions and
schisms, which undoubtedly are evils, he immediately adds *heresies*
likewise. Now, that which he subjoins to evil things, he of course
confesses to be itself an evil; and all the greater, indeed, because he
tells us that his belief of their schisms and dissensions was grounded
on his knowledge that “there must be heresies also.” <span
id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890.md) For he shows us that it was owing
to the prospect of the greater evil that he readily believed the
existence of the lighter ones; and so far indeed was he from believing,
in respect of evils (of such a kind), that heresies were good, that his
object was to forewarn us that we ought not to be surprised at
temptations of even a worse stamp, since (he said) they tended “to make
manifest all such as were approved;” <span
id="fr_1891"></span>[1892](#fn_1891.md) in other words, those whom they
were unable to pervert. <span id="fr_1892"></span>[1893](#fn_1892.md) In
short, since the whole passage <span
id="fr_1893"></span>[1894](#fn_1893.md) points to the maintenance of unity
and the checking of divisions, inasmuch as heresies sever men from unity
no less than schisms and dissensions, no doubt he classes heresies under
the same head of censure as he does schisms also and dissensions. And by
so doing, he makes those to be “not approved,” who have fallen into
heresies; more especially when with reproofs he exhorts <span
id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894.md) men to turn away from such,
teaching them that they should “all speak and think the selfsame
thing,” <span id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895.md) the very object which
heresies do not permit.
