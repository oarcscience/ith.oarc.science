<span id="v.iv.vi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Second Epistle to the
Corinthians. The Creator the Father of Mercies. Shown to Be Such in the
Old Testament, and Also in Christ.  The Newness of the New Testament. 
The Veil of Obdurate Blindness Upon Israel, Not Reprehensible on
Marcion’s Principles. The Jews Guilty in Rejecting the Christ of the
Creator.  Satan, the God of This World. The Treasure in Earthen Vessels
Explained Against Marcion. The Creator’s Relation to These Vessels, I.e.
Our Bodies.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.xi-p2"></span>If, owing to the fault of human error,
the word *God* has become a common name (since in the world there are
said and believed to be “gods many” <span
id="fr_5678"></span>[5679](#fn_5678) .md), yet “the blessed God,” (who is
“the Father) of our Lord Jesus Christ,” <span
id="fr_5679"></span>[5680](#fn_5679.md) will be understood to be no other
God than the Creator, who both blessed all things (that He had made), as
you find in Genesis, <span id="fr_5680"></span>[5681](#fn_5680.md) and is
Himself “blessed by all things,” as Daniel tells us. <span
id="fr_5681"></span>[5682](#fn_5681.md) Now, if the title of *Father* may
be claimed for (Marcion’s) sterile god, how much more for the Creator?
To none other than Him is it suitable, who is also “the Father of
mercies,” <span id="fr_5682"></span>[5683](#fn_5682.md) and (in the
prophets) has been described as “full of compassion, and gracious, and
plenteous in mercy.” <span id="fr_5683"></span>[5684](#fn_5683.md) In Jonah
you find the signal act of His mercy, which He showed to the praying
Ninevites. <span id="fr_5684"></span>[5685](#fn_5684.md) How inflexible was
He at the tears of Hezekiah! <span id="fr_5685"></span>[5686](#fn_5685.md)
How ready to forgive Ahab, the husband of Jezebel, the blood of Naboth,
when he deprecated His anger. <span id="fr_5686"></span>[5687](#fn_5686.md)
How prompt in pardoning David on his confession of his sin <span
id="fr_5687"></span>[5688](#fn_5687.md) —preferring, indeed, the sinner’s
repentance to his death, of course because of His gracious attribute of
mercy. <span id="fr_5688"></span>[5689](#fn_5688.md) Now, if Marcion’s god
has exhibited or proclaimed any such thing as this, I will allow him to
be “the Father of mercies.” Since, however, he ascribes to him this
title only from the time he has been revealed, as if he were the father
of mercies from the time only when he began to liberate the human race,
then we on our side, too, <span id="fr_5689"></span>[5690](#fn_5689.md)
adopt the same precise date of his alleged revelation; but it is that we
may deny him! It is then not competent to him to ascribe any quality to
his god, whom indeed he only promulged by the fact of such an
ascription; for only if it were previously evident that his god had an
existence, could he be permitted to ascribe an attribute to him. The
ascribed attribute is only an accident; but accidents <span
id="fr_5690"></span>[5691](#fn_5690.md) are preceded by the statement of
the thing itself of which they are predicated, especially when another
claims the attribute which is ascribed to him who has not been
previously shown to exist. Our denial of his existence will be all the
more peremptory, because of the fact that the attribute which is alleged
in proof of it belongs to that God who has been already revealed.
Therefore “the New Testament” will appertain to none other than Him who
promised it—if not “its letter, yet its spirit;” <span
id="fr_5691"></span>[5692](#fn_5691.md) and herein will lie its *newness*.
Indeed, He who had engraved its letter in stones is the same as He who
had said of its spirit, “I will pour out of my Spirit upon all
flesh.” <span id="fr_5692"></span>[5693](#fn_5692.md) Even if “the letter
killeth, yet the Spirit giveth life;” <span
id="fr_5693"></span>[5694](#fn_5693.md) and both belong to Him who says: “I
kill, and I make alive; I wound, <span id="page_453">p. 453</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xi-Page_453"></span>and I heal.” <span
id="fr_5694"></span>[5695](#fn_5694.md) We have already made good the
Creator’s claim to this twofold character of judgment and goodness <span
id="fr_5695"></span>[5696](#fn_5695.md) —“killing in the letter” through
the law, and “quickening in the Spirit” through the Gospel. Now these
attributes, however different they be, cannot possibly make two gods;
for they have already (in the prevenient dispensation of the Old
Testament) been found to meet in One. <span
id="fr_5696"></span>[5697](#fn_5696.md) He alludes to Moses’ veil, covered
with which “his face could not be stedfastly seen by the children of
Israel.” <span id="fr_5697"></span>[5698](#fn_5697.md) Since he did this to
maintain the superiority of the glory of the New Testament, which is
permanent in its glory, over that of the Old, “which was to be done
away,” <span id="fr_5698"></span>[5699](#fn_5698.md) this fact gives
support to my belief which exalts the Gospel above the law and you must
look well to it that it does not even more than this. For only *there*
is superiority possible where was previously the thing over which
superiority can be affirmed. But then he says, “But their minds were
blinded” <span id="fr_5699"></span>[5700](#fn_5699.md) —of the world;
certainly not the Creator’s mind, but the minds of the people which are
in the world. <span id="fr_5700"></span>[5701](#fn_5700.md) Of Israel he
says, Even unto this day the same veil is upon their heart;” <span
id="fr_5701"></span>[5702](#fn_5701.md) showing that the veil which was on
the face of Moses was a figure of the veil which is on the heart of the
nation still; because even now Moses is not seen by them in heart, just
as he was not then seen by them in eye. But what concern has Paul with
the veil which still obscures Moses from their view, if the Christ of
the Creator, whom Moses predicted, is not yet come? How are the hearts
of the Jews represented as still covered and veiled, if the predictions
of Moses relating to Christ, in whom it was their duty to believe
through him, are as yet unfulfilled? What had the apostle of a strange
Christ to complain of, if the Jews failed in understanding the
mysterious announcements of their own God, unless the veil which was
upon their hearts had reference to that blindness which concealed from
their eyes the Christ of Moses? Then, again, the words which follow, But
when it shall turn to the Lord, the evil shall be taken away,” <span
id="fr_5702"></span>[5703](#fn_5702.md) properly refer to the Jew, over
whose gaze Moses’ veil is spread, to the effect that, when he is turned
to the faith of Christ, he will understand how Moses spoke of Christ.
But how shall the veil of the Creator be taken away by the Christ of
another god, whose mysteries the Creator could not possibly have
veiled—unknown mysteries, as they were of an unknown god? So he says
that “we now with open face” (meaning *the candour* of the heart, which
in the Jews had been covered with a veil), “beholding Christ, are
changed into the same image, from that glory” (wherewith Moses was
transfigured as by the glory of the Lord) “to another glory.” <span
id="fr_5703"></span>[5704](#fn_5703.md) By thus setting forth the glory
which illumined the person of Moses from his interview with God, and the
veil which concealed the same from the infirmity of the people, and by
superinducing thereupon the revelation and the glory of the Spirit in
the person of Christ—“even as,” to use his words, “by the Spirit of the
Lord” <span id="fr_5704"></span>[5705](#fn_5704.md) —he testifies that the
whole Mosaic system <span id="fr_5705"></span>[5706](#fn_5705.md) was a
figure of Christ, of whom the Jews indeed were ignorant, but who is
known to us Christians. We are quite aware that some passages are open
to ambiguity, from the way in which they are read, or else from their
punctuation, when there is room for these two causes of ambiguity. The
latter method has been adopted by Marcion, by reading the passage which
follows, “in whom the God of this world,” <span
id="fr_5706"></span>[5707](#fn_5706.md) as if it described the Creator as
the God of this world, in order that he may, by these words, imply that
there is another God for the other world. We, however, say that the
passage ought to be punctuated with a comma after God, to this effect:
“In whom God hath blinded the eyes of the unbelievers of this
world.” <span id="fr_5707"></span>[5708](#fn_5707.md) “In whom” means the
Jewish unbelievers, from some of whom the gospel is still hidden under
Moses’ veil. Now it is these whom God had threatened for “loving Him
indeed with the lip, whilst their heart was far from Him,” <span
id="fr_5708"></span>[5709](#fn_5708.md) in these angry words: “Ye shall
hear with your ears, and not understand; and see with your eyes, but not
perceive;” <span id="fr_5709"></span>[5710](#fn_5709.md) and, “If ye will
not believe, ye shall not understand;” <span
id="fr_5710"></span>[5711](#fn_5710.md) and again, “I will take away the
wisdom of their wise men, <span id="page_454">p. 454</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xi-Page_454"></span>and bring to nought <span
id="fr_5711"></span>[5712](#fn_5711.md) the understanding of their prudent
ones.”  But these words, of course, He did not pronounce against them
for concealing the gospel of the unknown God.  At any rate, if there is
a God of this world, <span id="fr_5712"></span>[5713](#fn_5712.md) He
blinds the heart of the unbelievers of this world, because they have not
of their own accord recognised His Christ, who ought to be understood
from His Scriptures. <span id="fr_5713"></span>[5714](#fn_5713.md) Content
with my advantage, I can willingly refrain from noticing to any greater
length <span id="fr_5714"></span>[5715](#fn_5714.md) this point of
ambiguous punctuation, so as not to give my adversary any
advantage, <span id="fr_5715"></span>[5716](#fn_5715.md) indeed, I might
have wholly omitted the discussion. A simpler answer I shall find ready
to hand in interpreting “the god of this world” of the devil, who once
said, as the prophet describes him: “I will be like the Most High; I
will exalt my throne in the clouds.” <span
id="fr_5716"></span>[5717](#fn_5716.md) The whole superstition, indeed, of
this world has got into his hands, <span
id="fr_5717"></span>[5718](#fn_5717.md) so that he blinds effectually the
hearts of unbelievers, and of none more than the apostate Marcion’s. Now
he did not observe how much this clause of the sentence made against
him: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath
shined in our hearts, to (give) the light of the knowledge (of His
glory) in the face of (Jesus) Christ.” <span
id="fr_5718"></span>[5719](#fn_5718.md) Now who was it that said; “Let
there be light?” <span id="fr_5719"></span>[5720](#fn_5719.md) And who was
it that said to Christ concerning giving light to the world: “I have set
Thee as a light to the Gentiles” <span
id="fr_5720"></span>[5721](#fn_5720.md) —to them, that is, “who sit in
darkness and in the shadow of death?” <span
id="fr_5721"></span>[5722](#fn_5721) (None else, surely, than He.md), to
whom the Spirit in the Psalm answers, in His foresight of the future,
saying, “The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, hath been displayed upon
us.” <span id="fr_5722"></span>[5723](#fn_5722.md) Now the countenance (or
person <span id="fr_5723"></span>[5724](#fn_5723) .md) of the Lord here is
Christ. Wherefore the apostle said above: “Christ, who is the image of
God.” <span id="fr_5724"></span>[5725](#fn_5724.md) Since Christ, then, is
the person of the Creator, who said, “Let there be light,” it follows
that Christ and the apostles, and the gospel, and the veil, and
Moses—nay, the whole of the dispensations—belong to the God who is the
Creator of this world, according to the testimony of the clause (above
adverted to), and certainly not to him who never said, “Let there be
light.” I here pass over discussion about another epistle, which we hold
to have been written to the Ephesians, but the heretics to the
Laodiceans. In it he tells <span id="fr_5725"></span>[5726](#fn_5725.md)
them to remember, that at the time when they were Gentiles they were
without Christ, aliens from (the commonwealth of) Israel, without
intercourse, without the covenants and any hope of promise, nay, without
God, even in his own world, <span id="fr_5726"></span>[5727](#fn_5726.md)
as the Creator thereof. Since therefore he said, that the Gentiles were
without God, whilst their god was the devil, not the Creator, it is
clear that he must be understood to be the lord of this world, whom the
Gentiles received as their god—not the Creator, of whom they were in
ignorance. But how does it happen, that “the treasure which we have in
these earthen vessels of ours” <span
id="fr_5727"></span>[5728](#fn_5727.md) should not be regarded as belonging
to the God who owns the vessels? Now since God’s glory is, that so great
a treasure is contained in earthen vessels, and since these earthen
vessels are of the Creator’s make, it follows that the glory is the
Creator’s; nay, since these vessels of His smack so much of the
excellency of the power of God, that power itself must be His also!
Indeed, all these things have been consigned to the said “earthen
vessels” for the very purpose that His excellence might be manifested
forth. Henceforth, then, the rival god will have no claim to the glory,
and consequently none to the power. Rather, dishonour and weakness will
accrue to him, because the earthen vessels with which he had nothing to
do have received all the excellency! Well, then, if it be in these very
earthen vessels that he tells us we have to endure so great
sufferings, <span id="fr_5728"></span>[5729](#fn_5728.md) in which we bear
about with us the very dying of God, <span
id="fr_5729"></span>[5730](#fn_5729) (Marcion’s.md) god is really
ungrateful and unjust, if he does not mean to restore this same
substance of ours at the resurrection, wherein so much has been endured
in loyalty to him, in which Christ’s very death is borne about, wherein
too the excellency of his power is treasured. <span
id="fr_5730"></span>[5731](#fn_5730.md) For he gives prominence to the
statement, “That the life also of Christ may be manifested in our
body,” <span id="fr_5731"></span>[5732](#fn_5731.md) as a contrast to the
preceding, that His death is borne about in our body. Now of *what life
of Christ* does he here speak?  Of that which we are now living?  Then
how is it, that in the words which follow he exhorts us not to the
things <span id="page_455">p. 455</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xi-Page_455"></span>which are seen and are temporal, but to
those which are not seen and are eternal <span
id="fr_5732"></span>[5733](#fn_5732.md) —in other words, not to the
present, but to the future? But if it be of the future life of Christ
that he speaks, intimating that it is to be made manifest in our
body, <span id="fr_5733"></span>[5734](#fn_5733.md) then he has clearly
predicted the resurrection of the flesh. <span
id="fr_5734"></span>[5735](#fn_5734.md) He says, too, that “our outward man
perishes,” <span id="fr_5735"></span>[5736](#fn_5735.md) not meaning by an
eternal perdition after death, but by labours and sufferings, in
reference to which he previously said, “For which cause we will not
faint.” <span id="fr_5736"></span>[5737](#fn_5736.md) Now, when he adds of
“the inward man” also, that it “is renewed day by day,” he demonstrates
both issues here—the wasting away of the body by the wear and tear <span
id="fr_5737"></span>[5738](#fn_5737.md) of its trials, and the renewal of
the soul <span id="fr_5738"></span>[5739](#fn_5738.md) by its contemplation
of the promises.

obdurate Jews. The text is:  “Sed obtunsi sunt sensus mundi.

the sentence as a qualification of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xi-p32.3"></span>τῶν ἀπίστων</span>. He adds another
interpretation just afterwards, which, we need not say, is both more
consistent with the sense of the passage and with the *consensus* of
Christian writers of all ages, although “it is historically curious” (as
Dean Alford has remarked) “that Irenæus \[*Hæres.* iv. 48, Origen,
Tertullian (v. 11, *contra Marcion*)\], Chrysostom, Œcumenius,
Theodoret, Theophylact, all repudiate, in their zeal against the
Manichæans, the grammatical rendering, and take <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.vi.xi-p32.4"></span>τῶν ἀπίστων τοῦ αἰῶνος

Alford’s reference to Tertullian which he makes B. iv. 11.\]
