<span id="v.viii.li-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter LI.—The Session of Jesus in His
Incarnate Nature at the Right Hand of God a Guarantee of the
Resurrection of Our Flesh.</span>

<span id="v.viii.li-p2"></span>That, however, which we have reserved for
a concluding argument, will now stand as a plea for all, and for the
apostle himself, who in very deed would have to be charged with extreme
indiscretion, if he had so abruptly, as some will have it, and as they
say, blindfold, and so indiscriminately, and so unconditionally,
excluded from the kingdom of God, and indeed from the court of heaven
itself, all flesh and blood whatsoever; since Jesus is still sitting
there at the right hand of the Father, <span
id="fr_7659"></span>[7660](#fn_7659) man, yet God—the last Adam, <span
id="fr_7660"></span>[7661](#fn_7660) yet the primary Word—flesh and
blood, yet purer than ours—who “shall descend in like manner as He
ascended *into heaven*” <span id="fr_7661"></span>[7662](#fn_7661) the
same both in substance and form, as the angels affirmed, <span
id="fr_7662"></span>[7663](#fn_7662) so as even to be recognised by
those who pierced Him. <span id="fr_7663"></span>[7664](#fn_7663)
Designated, as He is, “the Mediator <span
id="fr_7664"></span>[7665](#fn_7664) between God and man,” He keeps in
His own self the deposit of the flesh which has been committed to Him by
both parties—the pledge and security of its entire perfection. For as
“He has given to us the earnest of the Spirit,” <span
id="fr_7665"></span>[7666](#fn_7665) so has He received from us the
earnest of the flesh, and has carried it with Him into heaven as a
pledge of that complete entirety which is one day to be restored to it.
Be not disquieted, O flesh and blood, with any care; in Christ you have
acquired both heaven and the kingdom of God. Otherwise, if they say that
you are not in Christ, let them also say that Christ is not in heaven,
since they have denied you heaven.  Likewise “neither shall corruption,”
says he, “inherit incorruption.” <span
id="fr_7666"></span>[7667](#fn_7666) *This he says*, not that you may
take flesh and blood to be corruption, for they are themselves rather
the subjects of corruption,—I mean through death, since death does not
so much corrupt, as actually consume, our flesh and blood. But inasmuch
as he had plainly said that the works of the flesh and blood could not
obtain the kingdom of God, with the view of stating this with
accumulated stress, he deprived corruption itself—that is, death, which
profits so largely by the works of the flesh and blood—from all
inheritance of incorruption. For a little afterwards, he has described
what is, as it were, the death of death itself: “Death,” says he, “is
swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is
thy victory? The sting of death is sin”—here is the *corruption*; “and
the strength of sin is the law” <span
id="fr_7667"></span>[7668](#fn_7667) —that other law, no doubt, which he
has described “in his members as warring against the law of his
mind,” <span id="fr_7668"></span>[7669](#fn_7668) —meaning, of course,
the actual power of sinning against his will. Now he says in a previous
passage (of our Epistle to the Corinthians), that “the last enemy to be
destroyed is death.” <span id="fr_7669"></span>[7670](#fn_7669) In this
way, then, it is that corruption shall not inherit incorruption; in
other words, death shall not continue. When and how shall it cease? In
that “moment, that twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, when the dead
shall rise incorruptible.” <span id="fr_7670"></span>[7671](#fn_7670)
But what are these, if not they who were corruptible before—that is, our
bodies; in other words, our flesh and blood? And we undergo the change.
But in what condition, if not in that wherein we shall be found? “For
this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
immortality.” <span id="fr_7671"></span>[7672](#fn_7671) What mortal is
this but the flesh? what corruptible but the blood. Moreover, that you
may not suppose the apostle to have any other meaning, in his care to
teach you, and that you may understand him seriously to apply his
statement to the flesh, when he says “*this* corruptible” and “*this*
mortal,” he utters the words <span id="page_585">p. 585</span> <span
id="v.viii.li-Page_585"></span>while touching the surface of his own
body. <span id="fr_7672"></span>[7673](#fn_7672) He certainly could not
have pronounced these phrases except in reference to an object which was
palpable and apparent. The expression indicates a bodily exhibition.
Moreover, a corruptible body is one thing, and corruption is another; so
a mortal body is one thing, and mortality is another. For that which
suffers is one thing, and that which causes it to suffer is another.
Consequently, those things which are subject to corruption and
mortality, even the flesh and blood, must needs also be susceptible of
incorruption and immortality.
