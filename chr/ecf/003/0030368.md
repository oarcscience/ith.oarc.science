<span id="v.iv.iii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Instances of God’s
Repentance, and Notably in the Case of the Ninevites, Accounted for and
Vindicated.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xxiv-p2"></span>Furthermore, with respect to the
repentance which occurs in His conduct, <span
id="fr_2987"></span>[2988](#fn_2987) you interpret it with similar
perverseness just as if it were with fickleness and improvidence that He
repented, or on the recollection of some wrong-doing; because He
actually said, “It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be
king,” <span id="fr_2988"></span>[2989](#fn_2988) very much as if He
meant that His repentance savoured of an acknowledgment of some evil
work or error. Well, <span id="fr_2989"></span>[2990](#fn_2989) this is
not always implied. For there occurs even in good works a confession of
repentance, as a reproach and condemnation of the man who has proved
himself unthankful for a benefit. For instance, in this case of Saul,
the Creator, who had made no mistake in selecting him for the kingdom,
and endowing him with His Holy Spirit, makes a statement respecting the
goodliness of his person, how that He had most fitly chosen him as being
at that moment the choicest man, so that (as He says) there was not his
fellow among the children of Israel. <span
id="fr_2990"></span>[2991](#fn_2990) Neither was He ignorant how he
would afterwards turn out. For no one would bear you out in imputing
lack of foresight to that God whom, since you do not deny Him to be
divine, you allow to be also foreseeing; for this proper attribute of
divinity exists in Him.  However, He did, as I have said, burden <span
id="fr_2991"></span>[2992](#fn_2991) the guilt of Saul with the
confession of His own repentance; but as there is an absence of all
error and wrong in His choice of Saul, it follows that this repentance
is to be understood as upbraiding another <span
id="fr_2992"></span>[2993](#fn_2992) rather than as
self-incriminating. <span id="fr_2993"></span>[2994](#fn_2993) Look here
then, say you: I discover a self-incriminating case in the matter of the
Ninevites, when the book of Jonah declares, “And God repented of the
evil that He had said that He would do unto them; and He did it
not.” <span id="fr_2994"></span>[2995](#fn_2994) In accordance with
which Jonah himself says unto the Lord, “Therefore I fled before unto
Tarshish; for I knew that Thou art a gracious God and merciful, slow to
anger, and of great kindness, and repentest Thee of the evil.” <span
id="fr_2995"></span>[2996](#fn_2995) It is well, therefore, that he
premised the attribute <span id="fr_2996"></span>[2997](#fn_2996) of the
most good God as most patient over the wicked, and most abundant in
mercy and kindness over such as acknowledged and bewailed their sins, as
the Ninevites were then doing. For if He who has this attribute is the
Most Good, you will have first to relinquish that position of yours,
that the very contact with <span id="fr_2997"></span>[2998](#fn_2997)
evil is incompatible with such a Being, that is, with the most good God.
And because <span id="page_316">p. 316</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.xxiv-Page_316"></span>Marcion, too, maintains that a good
tree ought not to produce bad fruit; but yet he has mentioned “evil” (in
the passage under discussion), which the most good God is incapable
of, <span id="fr_2998"></span>[2999](#fn_2998) is there forthcoming any
explanation of these “evils,” which may render them compatible with even
the most Good?  There is. We say, in short, that evil in the present
case <span id="fr_2999"></span>[3000](#fn_2999) means, not what may be
attributed to the Creator’s nature as an evil being, but what may be
attributed to His power as a judge.  In accordance with which He
declared, “I create evil,” <span id="fr_3000"></span>[3001](#fn_3000)
and, “I frame evil against you;” <span
id="fr_3001"></span>[3002](#fn_3001) meaning not to sinful evils, but
avenging ones.  What sort of stigma <span
id="fr_3002"></span>[3003](#fn_3002) pertains to these, congruous as
they are with God’s judicial character, we have sufficiently
explained. <span id="fr_3003"></span>[3004](#fn_3003) Now although these
are called “evils,” they are yet not reprehensible in a judge; nor
because of this their name do they show that the judge is evil: so in
like manner will this particular evil <span
id="fr_3004"></span>[3005](#fn_3004) be understood to be one of this
class of judiciary evils, and along with them to be compatible with (God
as) a judge.  The Greeks also sometimes <span
id="fr_3005"></span>[3006](#fn_3005) use the word “evils” for troubles
and injuries (not malignant ones), as in this passage of yours <span
id="fr_3006"></span>[3007](#fn_3006) is also meant. Therefore, if the
Creator repented of such evil as this, as showing that the creature
deserve decondemnation, and ought to be punished for his sin, then,
in <span id="fr_3007"></span>[3008](#fn_3007) the present instance no
fault of a criminating nature will be imputed to the Creator, for having
deservedly and worthily decreed the destruction of a city so full of
iniquity. What therefore He had justly decreed, having no evil purpose
in His decree, He decreed from the principle of justice, <span
id="fr_3008"></span>[3009](#fn_3008) not from malevolence. Yet He gave
it the name of “evil,” because of the evil and desert involved in the
very suffering itself. Then, you will say, if you excuse the evil under
name of justice, on the ground that He had justly determined destruction
against the people of Nineveh, He must even on this argument be
blameworthy, for having repented of an act of justice, which surely
should not be repented of. Certainly not, <span
id="fr_3009"></span>[3010](#fn_3009) my reply is; God will never repent
of an act of justice. And it now remains that we should understand what
God’s repentance means. For although man repents most frequently on the
recollection of a sin, and occasionally even from the
unpleasantness <span id="fr_3010"></span>[3011](#fn_3010) of some good
action, this is never the case with God. For, inasmuch as God neither
commits sin nor condemns a good action, in so far is there no room in
Him for repentance of either a good or an evil deed. Now this point is
determined for you even in the scripture which we have quoted. Samuel
says to Saul, “The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this
day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine that is better than
thou;” <span id="fr_3011"></span>[3012](#fn_3011) and into two parts
shall Israel be divided:  “for He will not turn Himself, nor repent; for
He does not repent as a man does.” <span
id="fr_3012"></span>[3013](#fn_3012) According, therefore, to this
definition, the divine repentance takes in all cases a different form
from that of man, in that it is never regarded as the result of
improvidence or of fickleness, or of any condemnation of a good or an
evil work.  What, then, will be the mode of God’s repentance? It is
already quite clear, <span id="fr_3013"></span>[3014](#fn_3013) if you
avoid referring it to human conditions.  For it will have no other
meaning than a simple change of a prior purpose; and this is admissible
without any blame even in a man, much more <span
id="fr_3014"></span>[3015](#fn_3014) in God, whose every purpose is
faultless.  Now in Greek the word for repentance (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.iii.xxiv-p30.1"></span>μετάνοια</span>) is
formed, not from the confession of a sin, but from a change of mind,
which in God we have shown to be regulated by the occurrence of varying
circumstances.
