<span id="v.iv.iii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—To the Severity of God There
Belong Accessory Qualities, Compatible with Justice. If Human Passions
are Predicated of God, They Must Not Be Measured on the Scale of Human
Imperfection.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xvi-p2"></span>Even His severity then is good,
because just: when the judge is good, that is just. Other qualities
likewise are good, by means of which the good work of a good severity
runs out its course, whether wrath, or jealousy, <span
id="fr_2881"></span>[2882](#fn_2881.md) or sternness. <span
id="fr_2882"></span>[2883](#fn_2882.md) For all these are as
indispensable <span id="fr_2883"></span>[2884](#fn_2883.md) to severity as
severity is to justice.  The shamelessness of an age, which ought to
have been reverent, had to be avenged. Accordingly, qualities which
pertain to the judge, when they are actually free from blame, as the
judge himself is, will never be able to be charged upon him as a
fault. <span id="fr_2884"></span>[2885](#fn_2884.md) What would be said,
if, when you thought the doctor necessary, you were to find fault with
his instruments, because they cut, or cauterize, or amputate, or
tighten; whereas there could be no doctor of any value without his
professional tools?  Censure, if you please, the practitioner who cuts
badly, amputates clumsily, is rash in his cautery; and even blame his
implements as rough tools of his art. Your conduct is equally
unreasonable, <span id="fr_2885"></span>[2886](#fn_2885.md) when you allow
indeed that God is a judge, but at the same time destroy those
operations and dispositions by which He discharges His judicial
functions. We are taught <span id="fr_2886"></span>[2887](#fn_2886.md) God
by the prophets, and by Christ, not by the philosophers nor by Epicurus.
We who believe that God really lived on earth, and took upon Him the low
estate of human form, <span id="fr_2887"></span>[2888](#fn_2887.md) for the
purpose of man’s salvation, are very far from thinking as those do who
refuse to believe that God cares for <span
id="fr_2888"></span>[2889](#fn_2888.md) anything. Whence has found its way
to the heretics an argument of this kind:  If God is angry, and jealous,
and roused, and grieved, He must therefore be corrupted, and must
therefore die.  Fortunately, however, it is a part of the creed of
Christians even to believe that God did die, <span
id="fr_2889"></span>[2890](#fn_2889.md) and yet that He is alive for
evermore.  Superlative is their folly, who prejudge divine things from
human; so <span id="page_310">p. 310</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.xvi-Page_310"></span>that, because in man’s corrupt
condition there are found passions of this description, therefore there
must be deemed to exist in God also sensations <span
id="fr_2890"></span>[2891](#fn_2890.md) of the same kind. Discriminate
between the natures, and assign to them their respective senses, which
are as diverse as their natures require, although they seem to have a
community of designations. We read, indeed, of God’s right hand, and
eyes, and feet: these must not, however, be compared with those of human
beings, because they are associated in one and the same name.  Now, as
great as shall be the difference between the divine and the human body,
although their members pass under identical names, so great will also be
the diversity between the divine and the human soul, notwithstanding
that their sensations are designated by the same names.  These
sensations in the human being are rendered just as corrupt by the
corruptibility of man’s substance, as in God they are rendered
incorruptible by the incorruption of the divine essence.  Do you really
believe the Creator to be God? By all means, is your reply. How then do
you suppose that in God there is anything human, and not that all is
divine?  Him whom you do not deny to be God, you confess to be not
human; because, when you confess Him to be God, you have, in fact,
already determined that He is undoubtedly diverse from every sort of
human conditions. Furthermore, although you allow, with others, <span
id="fr_2891"></span>[2892](#fn_2891.md) that man was inbreathed by God into
a living soul, not God by man, it is yet palpably absurd of you to be
placing human characteristics in God rather than divine ones in man, and
clothing God in the likeness of man, instead of man in the image of God.
And this, therefore, is to be deemed the likeness of God in man, that
the human soul have the same emotions and sensations as God, although
they are not of the same kind; differing as they do both in their
conditions and their issues according to their nature. Then, again, with
respect to the opposite sensations,—I mean meekness, patience, mercy,
and the very parent of them all, goodness,—why do you form your opinion
of <span id="fr_2892"></span>[2893](#fn_2892.md) the divine displays of
these (from the human qualities)? For we indeed do not possess them in
perfection, because it is God alone who is perfect. So also in regard to
those others,—namely, anger and irritation, we are not affected by them
in so happy a manner, because God alone is truly happy, by reason of His
property of incorruptibility. Angry He will possibly be, but not
irritated, nor dangerously tempted; <span
id="fr_2893"></span>[2894](#fn_2893.md) He will be moved, but not
subverted. <span id="fr_2894"></span>[2895](#fn_2894.md) All appliances He
must needs use, because of all contingencies; as many sensations as
there are causes: anger because of the wicked, and indignation because
of the ungrateful, and jealousy because of the proud, and whatsoever
else is a hinderance to the evil. So, again, mercy on account of the
erring, and patience on account of the impenitent, and pre-eminent
resources <span id="fr_2895"></span>[2896](#fn_2895.md) on account of the
meritorious, and whatsoever is necessary to the good. All these
affections He is moved by in that peculiar manner of His own, in which
it is profoundly fit <span id="fr_2896"></span>[2897](#fn_2896.md) that He
should be affected; and it is owing to Him that man is also similarly
affected in a way which is equally his own.
