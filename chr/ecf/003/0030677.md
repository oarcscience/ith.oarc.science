<span id="v.ix.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—How the Son Was Forsaken by the
Father Upon the Cross. The True Meaning Thereof Fatal to Praxeas. So
Too, the Resurrection of Christ, His Ascension, Session at the Father’s
Right Hand, and Mission of the Holy Ghost.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xxx-p2"></span>However, if you persist in pushing your
views further, I shall find means of answering you with greater
stringency, and of meeting you with the exclamation of the Lord Himself,
so as to challenge you with the question, What is your inquiry and
reasoning about *that*?  You have Him exclaiming in the midst of His
passion: “My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?” <span
id="fr_8185"></span>[8186](#fn_8185) Either, then, the Son suffered,
being “forsaken” by the Father, and the Father consequently suffered
nothing, inasmuch as He forsook the Son; or else, if it was the Father
who suffered, then to what <span id="page_627">p. 627</span> <span
id="v.ix.xxx-Page_627"></span>God was it that He addressed His cry?  But
this was the voice of flesh and soul, that is to say, of man—not of the
Word and Spirit, that is to say, not of God; and it was uttered so as to
prove the impassibility of God, who “forsook” His Son, so far as He
handed over His human substance to the suffering of death.  This verity
the apostle also perceived, when he writes to this effect: “If the
Father spared not His own Son.” <span
id="fr_8186"></span>[8187](#fn_8186) This did Isaiah before him likewise
perceive, when he declared: “And the Lord hath delivered Him up for our
offences.” <span id="fr_8187"></span>[8188](#fn_8187) In this manner He
“forsook” Him, in *not sparing* Him; “forsook” Him, in *delivering Him
up*. In all other respects the Father did not forsake the Son, for it
was into His Father’s hands that the Son commended His spirit. <span
id="fr_8188"></span>[8189](#fn_8188) Indeed, after so commending it, He
instantly died; and as the Spirit <span
id="fr_8189"></span>[8190](#fn_8189) remained with the flesh, the flesh
cannot undergo the full extent of death, *i.e., in corruption and
decay*. For the Son, therefore, to die, amounted to His being forsaken
by the Father. The Son, then, both dies and rises again, according to
the Scriptures. <span id="fr_8190"></span>[8191](#fn_8190) It is the
Son, too, who ascends to the heights of heaven, <span
id="fr_8191"></span>[8192](#fn_8191) and also descends to the inner
parts of the earth. <span id="fr_8192"></span>[8193](#fn_8192) “He
sitteth at the Father’s right hand” <span
id="fr_8193"></span>[8194](#fn_8193) —not the Father at His own. He is
seen by Stephen, at his martyrdom by stoning, still sitting at the right
hand of God <span id="fr_8194"></span>[8195](#fn_8194) where He will
continue to sit, until the Father shall make His enemies His
footstool. <span id="fr_8195"></span>[8196](#fn_8195) He will come again
on the clouds of heaven, just as He appeared when He ascended into
heaven. <span id="fr_8196"></span>[8197](#fn_8196) Meanwhile He has
received from the Father the promised gift, and has shed it forth, even
the Holy Spirit—the Third Name in the Godhead, and the Third Degree of
the Divine Majesty; the Declarer of the One *Monarchy of God*, but at
the same time the Interpreter of the *Economy*, to every one who hears
and receives the words of the new prophecy; <span
id="fr_8197"></span>[8198](#fn_8197) and “the Leader into all
truth,” <span id="fr_8198"></span>[8199](#fn_8198) such as is in the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, according to the mystery of the
doctrine of Christ.
