<span id="iv.xi.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—Scripture Alone Offers Clear
Knowledge on the Questions We Have Been Controverting.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xxvi-p2"></span>Now there is no end to the uncertainty
and <span id="page_207">p. 207</span> <span
id="iv.xi.xxvi-Page_207"></span>irregularity of human opinion, until we
come to the limits which God has prescribed. I shall at last retire
within our own lines and firmly hold my ground there, for the purpose of
proving to the Christian (the soundness of) my answers to the
Philosophers and the Physicians. Brother (in Christ), on your own
foundation <span id="fr_1685"></span>[1686](#fn_1685) build up your
faith. Consider the wombs of the most sainted women instinct with the
life within them, and their babes which not only breathed therein, but
were even endowed with prophetic intuition. See how the bowels of
Rebecca are disquieted, <span id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686)
though her child-bearing is as yet remote, and there is no impulse of
(vital) air. Behold, a twin offspring chafes within the mother’s womb,
although she has no sign as yet of the twofold nation. Possibly we might
have regarded as a prodigy the contention of this infant progeny, which
struggled before it lived, which had animosity previous to animation, if
it had simply disturbed the mother by its restlessness within her.  But
when her womb opens, and the number of her offspring is seen, and their
presaged condition known, we have presented to us a proof not merely of
the (separate) souls of the infants, but of their hostile struggles too.
He who was the first to be born was threatened with detention by him who
was anticipated in birth, who was not yet fully brought forth, but whose
hand only had been born. Now if he actually imbibed life, and received
his soul, in Platonic style, at his first breath; or else, after the
Stoic rule, had the earliest taste of animation on touching the frosty
air; what was the other about, who was so eagerly looked for, who was
still detained within the womb, and was trying to detain (the other)
outside? I suppose he had not yet breathed when he seized his brother’s
heel; <span id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687) and was still warm with
his mother’s warmth, when he so strongly wished to be the first to quit
the womb. What an infant! so emulous, so strong, and already so
contentious; and all this, I suppose, because even now full of life! 
Consider, again, those extraordinary conceptions, which were more
wonderful still, of the barren woman and the virgin: these women would
only be able to produce imperfect offspring against the course of
nature, from the very fact that one of them was too old to bear seed,
and the other was pure from the contact of man. If there was to be
bearing at all in the case, it was only fitting that they should be born
without a soul, (as the philosopher would say,) who had been irregularly
conceived. However, even these have life, each of them in his mother’s
womb. Elizabeth exults with joy, (for) John had leaped in her
womb; <span id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688) Mary magnifies the
Lord, (for) Christ had instigated her within. <span
id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689) The mothers recognise each their
own offspring, being moreover each recognised by their infants, which
were therefore of course alive, and were not souls merely, but spirits
also. Accordingly you read the word of God which was spoken to Jeremiah,
“Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee.” <span
id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690) Since God forms us in the womb, He
also breathes upon us, as He also did at the first creation, when “the
Lord God formed man, and breathed into him the breath of life.” <span
id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691) Nor could God have known man in the
womb, except in his entire nature: “And before thou camest forth out of
the womb, I sanctified thee.” <span id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692)
Well, was it then a dead body at that early stage? Certainly not. For
“God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”
