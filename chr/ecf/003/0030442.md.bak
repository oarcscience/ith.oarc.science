<span id="v.iv.v.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIII.—Conclusions. Jesus as the
Christ of the Creator Proved from the Events of the Last Chapter of St.
Luke. The Pious Women at the Sepulchre. The Angels at the Resurrection.
The Manifold Appearances of Christ After the Resurrection. His Mission
of the Apostles Amongst All Nations. All Shown to Be in Accordance with
the Wisdom of the Almighty Father, as Indicated in Prophecy. The Body of
Christ After Death No Mere Phantom. Marcion’s Manipulation of the Gospel
on This Point.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xliii-p2"></span>It was very meet that the man who
buried the Lord should thus be noticed in prophecy, and thenceforth be
“blessed;” <span id="fr_5164"></span>[5165](#fn_5164.md) since prophecy
does not omit the (pious) office of the women who resorted before
day-break to the sepulchre with the spices which they had pre<span
id="page_422">p. 422</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xliii-Page_422"></span>pared. <span
id="fr_5165"></span>[5166](#fn_5165.md) For of this incident it is said by
Hosea: “To seek my face they will watch till day-light, saying unto me,
Come, and let us return to the Lord: for He hath taken away, and He will
heal us; He hath smitten, and He will bind us up; after two days will He
revive us: in the third day He will raise us up.” <span
id="fr_5166"></span>[5167](#fn_5166.md) For who can refuse to believe that
these words often revolved <span id="fr_5167"></span>[5168](#fn_5167.md) in
the thought of those women between the sorrow of that desertion with
which at present they seemed to themselves to have been smitten by the
Lord, and the hope of the resurrection itself, by which they rightly
supposed that all would be restored to them? But when “they found not
the body (of the Lord Jesus),” <span
id="fr_5168"></span>[5169](#fn_5168.md) “His sepulture was removed from the
midst of them,” <span id="fr_5169"></span>[5170](#fn_5169.md) according to
the prophecy of Isaiah.  “Two angels however, appeared there.” <span
id="fr_5170"></span>[5171](#fn_5170.md) For just so many honorary
companions <span id="fr_5171"></span>[5172](#fn_5171.md) were required by
the word of God, which usually prescribes “*two witnesses*.” <span
id="fr_5172"></span>[5173](#fn_5172.md) Moreover, the women, returning from
the sepulchre, and from this vision of the angels, were foreseen by
Isaiah, when he says, “Come, ye women, who return from the
vision;” <span id="fr_5173"></span>[5174](#fn_5173.md) that is, “come,” to
report the resurrection of the Lord. It was well, however, that the
unbelief of the disciples was so persistent, in order that to the last
we might consistently maintain that Jesus revealed Himself to the
disciples as none other than the Christ of the prophets.  For as two of
them were taking a walk, and when the Lord had joined their company,
without its appearing that it was He, and whilst He dissembled His
knowledge of what had just taken place, <span
id="fr_5174"></span>[5175](#fn_5174.md) they say: “But we trusted that it
had been He which should have redeemed Israel,” <span
id="fr_5175"></span>[5176](#fn_5175.md) —meaning their own, that is, the
Creator’s Christ.  So far had He been from declaring Himself to them as
another Christ! They could not, however, deem Him to be the Christ of
the Creator; nor, if He was so deemed by them, could He have tolerated
this opinion concerning Himself, unless He were really He whom He was
supposed to be. Otherwise He would actually be the author of error, and
the prevaricator of truth, contrary to the character of the good God.
But at no time even after His resurrection did He reveal Himself to them
as any other than what, on their own showing, they had always thought
Him to be. He pointedly <span id="fr_5176"></span>[5177](#fn_5176.md)
reproached them: “O fools, and slow of heart in not believing that which
He spake unto you.” <span id="fr_5177"></span>[5178](#fn_5177.md) By saying
this, He proves that He does not belong to the rival god, but to the
same God.  For the same thing was said by the angels to the women:
“Remember how He spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee, saying, The
Son of man must be delivered up, and be crucified, and on the third day
rise again.” <span id="fr_5178"></span>[5179](#fn_5178.md) “*Must* be
delivered up;” and why, except that it was so written by God the
Creator? He therefore upbraided them, because they were offended solely
at His passion, and because they doubted of the truth of the
resurrection which had been reported to them by the women, whereby (they
showed that) they had not believed Him to have been the very same as
they had thought Him to be. Wishing, therefore, to be believed by them
in this wise, He declared Himself to be just what they had deemed Him to
be—the Creator’s Christ, the Redeemer of Israel. But as touching the
reality of His body, what can be plainer? When they were doubting
whether He were not a phantom—nay, were supposing that He was one—He
says to them, “Why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your
hearts? See <span id="fr_5179"></span>[5180](#fn_5179.md) my hands and my
feet, that it is I myself; for a spirit hath not bones, as ye see me
have.” <span id="fr_5180"></span>[5181](#fn_5180.md) Now Marcion was
unwilling to expunge from his Gospel some statements which even made
against him—I suspect, on purpose, to have it in his power from the
passages which he did not suppress, when he could have done so, either
to deny that he had expunged anything, or else to justify his
suppressions, if he made any. But he spares only such passages as he can
subvert quite as well by explaining them away as by expunging them from
the text.  Thus, in the passage before us, he would have the words, “A
spirit hath not bones, as ye see me have,” so transposed, as to mean, “A
spirit, such as ye see me to be, hath not bones;” that is to say, it is
not the nature of a spirit to have bones. But what need of so tortuous a
construction, when He might have simply said, “A spirit hath not bones,
even as you observe that I have not?”  Why, moreover, does He offer His
hands and His feet for their examination—limbs which consist of bones—if
He had no bones? Why, too, does He add, “Know that <span
id="page_423">p. 423</span> <span id="v.iv.v.xliii-Page_423"></span>it
is I myself,” <span id="fr_5181"></span>[5182](#fn_5181.md) when they had
before known Him to be corporeal?  Else, if He were altogether a
phantom, why did He upbraid them for supposing Him to be a phantom? But
whilst they still believed not, He asked them for some meat, <span
id="fr_5182"></span>[5183](#fn_5182.md) for the express purpose of showing
them that He had teeth. <span id="fr_5183"></span>[5184](#fn_5183.md)

<span id="v.iv.v.xliii-p23"></span>And now, as I would venture to
believe, <span id="fr_5184"></span>[5185](#fn_5184.md) we have accomplished
our undertaking. We have set forth Jesus Christ as none other than the
Christ of the Creator. Our proofs we have drawn from His doctrines,
maxims, <span id="fr_5185"></span>[5186](#fn_5185.md) affections, feelings,
miracles, sufferings, and even resurrection—as foretold by the
prophets. <span id="fr_5186"></span>[5187](#fn_5186.md) Even to the last He
taught us (the same truth of His mission), when He sent forth His
apostles to preach His gospel “among all nations;” <span
id="fr_5187"></span>[5188](#fn_5187.md) for He thus fulfilled the psalm:
“Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the
end of the world.” <span id="fr_5188"></span>[5189](#fn_5188.md) Marcion, I
pity you; your labour has been in vain. For the Jesus Christ who appears
in your Gospel is mine.
