<span id="v.ix.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—More Passages from the Same
Gospel in Proof of the Same Portion of the Catholic Faith. Praxeas’
Taunt of Worshipping Two Gods Repudiated.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xxiii-p2"></span>Again, when Martha in a later passage
acknowledged Him to be the Son of God, <span
id="fr_8069"></span>[8070](#fn_8069) she no more made a mistake than
Peter <span id="fr_8070"></span>[8071](#fn_8070) and Nathanæl <span
id="fr_8071"></span>[8072](#fn_8071) had; and yet, even if she had made
a mistake, she would at once have learnt the truth: for, behold, when
about to raise her brother from the dead, the Lord looked up to heaven,
and, addressing the Father, said—as the Son, of course:  “Father, I
thank Thee that Thou always hearest me; it is because of these crowds
that are standing by that I have spoken *to Thee*, that they may believe
that Thou hast sent me.” <span id="fr_8072"></span>[8073](#fn_8072) But
in the trouble of His soul, (on a later occasion,) He said: “What shall
I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause is it that I
am come to this hour; only, O Father, do Thou glorify Thy name” <span
id="fr_8073"></span>[8074](#fn_8073) —in which He <span id="page_619">p.
619</span> <span id="v.ix.xxiii-Page_619"></span>spake as the Son. (At
another time) He said: “I am come in my Father’s name.” <span
id="fr_8074"></span>[8075](#fn_8074) Accordingly, the Son’s voice was
indeed alone sufficient, (when addressed) to the Father.  But, behold,
with an abundance (of evidence) <span
id="fr_8075"></span>[8076](#fn_8075) the Father from heaven replies, for
the purpose of testifying to the Son: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I
am well pleased; hear ye Him.” <span
id="fr_8076"></span>[8077](#fn_8076) So, again, in that *asseveration*,
“I have both glorified, and will glorify again,” <span
id="fr_8077"></span>[8078](#fn_8077) how many Persons do you discover,
obstinate Praxeas? Are there not as many as there are voices? You have
the Son on earth, you have the Father in heaven. Now this is not a
separation; it is nothing but the divine dispensation. We know, however,
that God is in the bottomless depths, and exists everywhere; but then it
is by power and authority. We are also sure that the Son, being
indivisible from Him, is everywhere with Him.  Nevertheless, in the
Economy *or Dispensation* itself, the Father willed that the Son should
be regarded <span id="fr_8078"></span>[8079](#fn_8078) as on earth, and
Himself in heaven; whither the Son also Himself looked up, and prayed,
and made supplication of the Father; whither also He taught us to raise
ourselves, and pray, “Our Father which art in heaven,” etc., <span
id="fr_8079"></span>[8080](#fn_8079) —although, indeed, He is everywhere
present. This *heaven* the Father willed to be His own throne; while He
made the Son to be “a little lower than the angels,” <span
id="fr_8080"></span>[8081](#fn_8080) by sending Him down to the earth,
but meaning at the same time to “crown Him with glory and honour,” <span
id="fr_8081"></span>[8082](#fn_8081) even by taking Him back to heaven.
This He now made good to Him when He said: “I have both glorified
*Thee*, and will glorify *Thee again*.” The Son offers His request from
earth, the Father gives His promise from heaven.  Why, then, do you make
liars of both the Father and the Son? If either the Father spake from
heaven to the Son when He Himself was the Son on earth, or the Son
prayed to the Father when He was Himself the Son in heaven, how happens
it that the Son made a request of His own very self, by asking it of the
Father, since the Son was the Father? Or, on the other hand, how is it
that the Father made a promise to Himself, by making it to the Son,
since the Father was the Son? Were we even to maintain that they are two
separate gods, as you are so fond of throwing out against us, it would
be a more tolerable assertion than the maintenance of so versatile and
changeful a God as yours!  Therefore it was that in the passage before
us the Lord declared to the people present: “Not on my own account has
this voice addressed me, but for your sakes,” <span
id="fr_8082"></span>[8083](#fn_8082) that these likewise may believe
both in the Father and in the Son, severally, in their own names and
persons and positions.  “Then again, Jesus exclaims, and says, He that
believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me;” <span
id="fr_8083"></span>[8084](#fn_8083) because it is through the Son that
men believe in the Father, while the Father also is the authority whence
springs belief in the Son. “And he that seeth me, seeth Him that sent
me.” <span id="fr_8084"></span>[8085](#fn_8084) How so?  Even because,
(as He afterwards declares,) “I have not spoken from myself, but the
Father which sent me: He hath given me a commandment what I should say,
and what I should speak.” <span id="fr_8085"></span>[8086](#fn_8085) For
“the Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should
know when I ought to speak” <span id="fr_8086"></span>[8087](#fn_8086)
the word which I actually speak. “Even as the Father hath said unto me,
so do I speak.” <span id="fr_8087"></span>[8088](#fn_8087) Now, in what
way these things were said to Him, the evangelist and beloved disciple
John knew better than Praxeas; and therefore he adds concerning his own
meaning:  “Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knew that the
Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from
God, and was going to God.” <span id="fr_8088"></span>[8089](#fn_8088)
Praxeas, however, would have it that it was the Father who proceeded
forth from Himself, and had returned to Himself; so that what the devil
put into the heart of Judas was the betrayal, not of the Son, but of the
Father Himself. But for the matter of that, things have not turned out
well either for the devil or the heretic; because, even in the Son’s
case, the treason which the devil wrought against Him contributed
nothing to his advantage. It was, then, the Son of God, who was in the
Son of man, that was betrayed, as the Scripture says afterwards: “Now is
the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.” <span
id="fr_8089"></span>[8090](#fn_8089) Who is here meant by “God?”
Certainly not the Father, but the Word of the Father, who was in the Son
of man—that is in the flesh, in which Jesus had been already glorified
by *the divine* power and word. “And God,” says He, “shall also glorify
Him in Himself;” <span id="fr_8090"></span>[8091](#fn_8090) that is to
say, the Father shall glorify the Son, because He has Him within
Himself; and even though prostrated to the <span id="page_620">p.
620</span> <span id="v.ix.xxiii-Page_620"></span>earth, and put to
death, He would soon glorify Him by His resurrection, and making Him
conqueror over death.
