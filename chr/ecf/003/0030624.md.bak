<span id="v.viii.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—Death Changes, Without
Destroying, Our Mortal Bodies.  Remains of the Giants.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xlii-p2"></span>It is the transformation these shall
undergo which he explains to the Corinthians, when he writes: “We shall
all indeed rise again (though we shall not all undergo the
transformation) in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trump”—for none shall experience this change but those only who shall be
found in the flesh. “And the dead,” he says, “shall be raised, *and* we
shall be changed.” Now, after a careful consideration of this appointed
order, you will be able to adjust what follows to the preceding sense.
For when he adds, “This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this
mortal must put on immortality,” <span
id="fr_7557"></span>[7558](#fn_7557.md) this will assuredly be that house
from heaven, with which we so earnestly desire to be clothed upon,
whilst groaning in this our present body,—meaning, of course, over this
flesh in which we shall be surprised at last; because he says that we
are burdened whilst in this tabernacle, which we do not wish indeed to
be stripped of, but rather to be *in it* clothed over, in such a way
that mortality may be swallowed up of life, that is, by putting on over
us whilst we are transformed that vestiture which is from heaven. For
who is there that will not desire, while he is in the flesh, to put on
immortality, and to continue his life by a happy escape from death,
through the transformation which must be experienced instead of it,
without encountering too that *Hades* which will exact the very last
farthing? <span id="fr_7558"></span>[7559](#fn_7558.md) Notwithstanding, he
who has already traversed *Hades* is destined also to obtain the change
after the resurrection. For from this circumstance it is that we
definitively declare that the flesh will *by all means* rise again, and,
from the change that is to come over it, will assume the condition of
angels. Now, if it were merely in the case of those who shall be found
in the flesh that the <span id="page_576">p. 576</span> <span
id="v.viii.xlii-Page_576"></span>change must be undergone, in order that
mortality may be swallowed up of life—in other words, that the flesh (be
covered) with the heavenly and eternal raiment—it would either follow
that those who shall be found in death would not obtain life, deprived
as they would then be of the material and so to say the aliment of life,
that is, the flesh; or else, these also must needs undergo the change,
that in them too mortality may be swallowed up of life, since it is
appointed that they too should obtain life. But, you say, in the case of
the dead, mortality is already swallowed up of life. No, not in all
cases, certainly. For how many will most probably be found of men who
had just died—so recently put into their graves, that nothing in them
would seem to be decayed? For you do not of course deem a thing to be
decayed unless it be cut off, abolished, and withdrawn from our
perception, as having in every possible way ceased to be apparent. There
are the carcases of the giants of old time; it will be obvious enough
that they are not absolutely decayed, for their bony frames are still
extant. We have already spoken of this elsewhere. <span
id="fr_7559"></span>[7560](#fn_7559.md) For instance, <span
id="fr_7560"></span>[7561](#fn_7560.md) even lately in this very
city, <span id="fr_7561"></span>[7562](#fn_7561.md) when they were
sacrilegiously laying the foundations of the Odeum on a good many
ancient graves, people were horror-stricken to discover, after some five
hundred years, bones, which still retained their moisture, and hair
which had not lost its perfume. It is certain not only that bones remain
indurated, but also that teeth continue undecayed for ages—both of them
the lasting germs of that body which is to sprout into life again in the
resurrection. Lastly, even if everything that is mortal in all the dead
shall then be found decayed—at any rate consumed by death, by time, and
through age,—is there nothing which will be “swallowed up of
life,” <span id="fr_7562"></span>[7563](#fn_7562.md) nor by being covered
over and arrayed in the vesture of immortality? Now, he who says that
mortality is going to be swallowed up of life has already admitted that
what is dead *is not destroyed* by those other *before-mentioned
devourers*. And verily it will be extremely fit that all shall be
consummated and brought about by the operations of God, *and* not by the
laws of nature. Therefore, inasmuch as what is mortal has to be
swallowed up of life, it must needs be brought out to view in order to
be so swallowed up; (needful) also to be swallowed up, in order to
undergo the ultimate transformation. If you were to say that a fire is
to be lighted, you could not possibly allege that what is to kindle it
is sometimes necessary *and* sometimes not. In like manner, when he
inserts the words “If so be that being unclothed <span
id="fr_7563"></span>[7564](#fn_7563.md) we be not found naked,” <span
id="fr_7564"></span>[7565](#fn_7564.md) —referring, of course, to those who
shall not be found in the day of the Lord alive and in the flesh—he did
not say that they whom he had just described as unclothed or stripped,
were naked in any other sense than meaning that they should be
understood to be reinvested with the very same substance they had been
divested of. For although they shall be found naked when their flesh has
been laid aside, or to some extent sundered or worn away (and this
condition may well be called *nakedness*,) they shall afterwards recover
it again, in order that, being reinvested with the flesh, they may be
able also to have put over that the supervestment of immortality; for it
will be impossible for the outside garment to fit except over one who is
already dressed.
