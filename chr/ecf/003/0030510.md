<span id="v.v.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLI.—Sundry Quotations from Hermogenes.
Now Uncertain and Vague are His Speculations Respecting Motion in
Matter, and the Material Qualities of Good and Evil.</span>

<span id="v.v.xli-p2"></span>I come back to the point of *motion*, <span
id="fr_6563"></span>[6564](#fn_6563.md) that I may show how slippery you
are at every step. Motion in Matter was disordered, and confused, and
turbulent. This is why you apply to it the comparison of a boiler of hot
water surging over. Now how is it, that in another passage another sort
of motion is affirmed by you?  For when you want to represent Matter as
neither good nor evil, you say: “Matter, which is the substratum (of
creation) <span id="fr_6564"></span>[6565](#fn_6564.md) possessing as it
does motion in an equable impulse, <span
id="fr_6565"></span>[6566](#fn_6565.md) tends in no very great degree
either to good or to evil.” Now if it had this equable impulse, it could
not be turbulent, nor be like the boiling water of the caldron; it would
rather be even and regular, oscillating indeed of its own accord between
good and evil, but yet not prone or tending to either side. It would
swing, as the phrase is, in a just and exact balance. Now this is not
unrest; this is not turbulence or inconstancy; <span
id="fr_6566"></span>[6567](#fn_6566.md) but rather the regularity, and
evenness, and exactitude of a motion, inclining to neither side. If it
oscillated this way and that way, and inclined rather to one particular
side, it would plainly in that case merit the reproach of unevenness,
and inequality, and turbulence. Moreover, although the motion *of
Matter* was not prone either to good or to evil, it would still, of
course, oscillate between good and evil; so that from this circumstance
too it is obvious that Matter is contained within certain limits, <span
id="fr_6567"></span>[6568](#fn_6567.md) because its motion, while prone to
neither good nor evil, since it had no natural bent either way,
oscillated from either between both, and therefore was contained within
the limits of the two.  But you, in fact, place both good and evil in a
local habitation, <span id="fr_6568"></span>[6569](#fn_6568.md) when you
assert that motion in Matter inclined to neither of them. For Matter
which was local, <span id="fr_6569"></span>[6570](#fn_6569.md) when
inclining neither hither nor thither, inclined not to the places in
which good and evil were. But when you assign locality to good and evil,
you make them corporeal by making them local, since those things which
have local space must needs first have bodily substance. In fact, <span
id="fr_6570"></span>[6571](#fn_6570.md) incorporeal things could not have
any locality of their own except in a body, when they have access to a
body. <span id="fr_6571"></span>[6572](#fn_6571.md) But when Matter
inclined not to good and evil, it was as corporeal or local *essences*
that it did not incline to them. You err, therefore, when you will have
it that good and evil are substances. For you make substances of the
things to which you assign locality; <span
id="fr_6572"></span>[6573](#fn_6572.md) but you assign locality when you
keep motion in Matter poised equally distant from both sides. <span
id="fr_6573"></span>[6574](#fn_6573.md)
