<span id="iv.viii.i.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII. <span
id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714) —The Christian Refusal to Swear by the
Genius of Cæsar. Flippancy and Irreverence Retorted on the
Heathen.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xvii-p3"></span>As to your charges of obstinacy and
presumption, whatever you allege against us, even in these respects,
there are not wanting points in which you will bear a comparison with
us. Our first step in this contumacious conduct concerns that which is
ranked by you immediately after <span id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715)
the worship due to God, that is, the worship due to the majesty of the
Cæsars, in respect of which we are charged with being irreligious
towards them, since we neither propitiate their images nor swear by
their genius. We are called enemies of the people. Well, be it so; yet
at the same time (it must not be forgotten, that) the emperors find
enemies amongst you heathen, and are constantly getting surnames to
signalize their triumphs—one becoming *Parthicus*, <span
id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716) and another *Medicus* and
*Germanicus*. <span id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717) On this head <span
id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718) the Roman people must see to it who
they are amongst whom <span id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719) there
still remain nations which are unsubdued and foreign to their rule. But,
at all events, you are of us, <span id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720)
and yet you conspire against us. (In reply, we need only state) a
well-known fact, <span id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721) that we
acknowledge the fealty of Romans to the emperors. No conspiracy has ever
broken out from our body: no Cæsar’s blood has ever fixed a stain upon
us, in the senate or even in the palace; no assumption of the purple has
ever in any of the provinces been affected by us. The Syrias still
exhale the odours of their corpses; still do the Gauls <span
id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722) fail to wash away (their blood) in the
waters of their Rhone. Your allegations of our insanity <span
id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723) I omit, be<span id="page_126">p.
126</span> <span id="iv.viii.i.xvii-Page_126"></span>cause they do not
compromise the Roman name. But I will grapple with <span
id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724) the charge of sacrilegious vanity, and
remind you of <span id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725) the irreverence of
your own lower classes, and the scandalous lampoons <span
id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726) of which the statues are so cognizant,
and the sneers which are sometimes uttered at the public games, <span
id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727) and the curses with which the circus
resounds.  If not in arms, you are in tongue at all events always
rebellious. But I suppose it is quite another affair to refuse to swear
by the genius of Cæsar?  For it is fairly open to doubt as to who are
perjurers on this point, when you do not swear honestly <span
id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728) even by your gods. Well, we do not
call the emperor God; for on this point *sannam facimus*, <span
id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729) as the saying is. But the truth is,
that you who call Cæsar God both mock him, by calling him what he is
not, and curse him, because he does not want to be what you call him.
For he prefers living to being made a god. <span
