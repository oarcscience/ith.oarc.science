id="vi.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—The First Clause.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p2"></span>The prayer begins with a testimony to God,
and with the reward of faith, when we say, “Our Father who art in the
heavens;” for (in so saying), we at once pray to God, and commend faith,
whose reward this appellation is.  It is written, “To them who believed
on Him He gave power to be called sons of God.” <span
id="fr_8767"></span>[8768](#fn_8767) However, our Lord very frequently
proclaimed God as a Father to us; nay, even gave a precept “that we call
no one on earth father, but the Father whom we have in the
heavens:” <span id="fr_8768"></span>[8769](#fn_8768) and so, in thus
praying, we are likewise obeying the precept. Happy they who recognize
their Father! This is the reproach that is brought against Israel, to
which the Spirit attests heaven and earth, saying, “I have begotten
sons, and they have not recognized me.” <span
id="fr_8769"></span>[8770](#fn_8769) Moreover, in saying “Father,” we
also call Him “God.” That appellation is one both of filial duty and of
power. Again, in the Father the Son is invoked; “for I,” saith He, “and
the Father are One.” <span id="fr_8770"></span>[8771](#fn_8770) Nor is
even our mother the Church passed by, if, that is, in the Father and the
Son is recognized the mother, from whom arises the name both of Father
and of Son.  In one general term, then, or word, we both honour God,
together with His own, <span id="fr_8771"></span>[8772](#fn_8771) and
are mindful of the precept, and set a mark on such as have forgotten
their Father.
