<span id="v.vii.i-p4"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="v.vii.i-p4.1"></span>This was written by our author in confutation
of certain heretics who denied the reality of Christ’s flesh, or at
least its identity with human flesh—fearing that, if they admitted the
reality of Christ’s flesh, they must also admit his resurrection in the
flesh; and, consequently, the resurrection of the human body after
death.</span>

id="v.vii.i-p7.1"></span>Chapter I.—The General Purport of This Work.
The Heretics, Marcion, Apelles, and Valentinus, Wishing to Impugn the
Doctrine of the Resurrection, Deprive Christ of All Capacity for Such a
Change by Denying His Flesh.</span>

<span id="v.vii.i-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.vii.i-p8.1"></span>They</span> who are so anxious to shake that
belief in the resurrection which was firmly settled <span
id="fr_6939"></span>[6940](#fn_6939.md) before the appearance of our modern
Sadducees, <span id="fr_6940"></span>[6941](#fn_6940.md) as even to deny
that the expectation thereof has any relation whatever to the flesh,
have great cause for besetting the flesh of Christ also with doubtful
questions, as if it either had no existence at all, or possessed a
nature altogether different from human flesh. *For they cannot but be
apprehensive* that, if it be once determined that *Christ’s flesh* was
human, a presumption would immediately arise in opposition to them, that
that flesh must by all means rise again, which has already risen in
Christ. Therefore we shall have to guard our belief in the
resurrection <span id="fr_6941"></span>[6942](#fn_6941.md) from the same
armoury, whence they get their weapons of destruction. Let us examine
our Lord’s bodily substance, for about His spiritual nature all are
agreed. <span id="fr_6942"></span>[6943](#fn_6942.md) It is His flesh that
is in question. Its verity and quality are the points in dispute. Did it
ever exist? whence was it derived? and of what kind was it? If we
succeed in demonstrating it, we shall lay down a law for our own
resurrection. Marcion, in order that he might deny the flesh of Christ,
denied also His nativity, or else he denied His flesh in order that he
might deny His nativity; because, of course, he was afraid that His
nativity and His flesh bore mutual testimony to each other’s reality,
since there is no nativity without flesh, and no flesh without nativity.
As if indeed, under the prompting of that licence which is ever the same
in all heresy, he too might not very well have either denied the
nativity, although admitting the flesh,—like Apelles, who was first a
disciple of his, and afterwards an apostate,—or, while admitting both
the flesh and the nativity, have interpreted them in a different sense,
as did Valentinus, who resembled Apelles both in his discipleship and
desertion *of Marcion*. At all events, he who represented the flesh of
Christ to be imaginary was equally able to pass off His nativity as a
phantom; so that the virgin’s conception, and pregnancy, and
child-bearing, and then the whole course <span
id="fr_6943"></span>[6944](#fn_6943.md) of her infant too, would have to be
regarded as putative. <span id="fr_6944"></span>[6945](#fn_6944.md) *These
facts pertaining to the nativity of Christ* would escape the notice of
the same eyes and the same senses as failed to grasp the full idea <span
id="fr_6945"></span>[6946](#fn_6945.md) of His flesh.

<span id="v.vii.i-p3"></span> In his work *On the Resurrection of the
Flesh* (chap. ii.), Tertullian refers to this tract, and calls it “De
Carne Domini adversus quatuor hæreses”: the four heresies being those of
Marcion, Apelles, Basilides, and Valentinus. Pamelius, indeed,
designates the tract by this fuller title instead of the usual one, “De
Carne Christi.” \[This tract contains references to works written while
our author was Montanistic, but it contains no positive Montanism. It
should not be dated earlier than <span class="sc"><span
id="v.vii.i-p3.2"></span>a.d</span>. 207.\]
