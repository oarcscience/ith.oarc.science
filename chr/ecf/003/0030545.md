<span id="v.vi.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—The Lax and Dangerous Views of
This Sect Respecting Good Works. That These are Unnecessary to the
Spiritual Man.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxx-p2"></span>For this reason it is that they neither
regard works <span id="fr_6882"></span>[6883](#fn_6882.md) as necessary for
themselves, nor do they observe any of the calls of duty, eluding even
the necessity of martyrdom on any pretence which may suit their
pleasure. For this rule, (they say), is enjoined upon the animal seed,
in order that the salvation, which we do not possess by any privilege of
our state, <span id="fr_6883"></span>[6884](#fn_6883.md) we may work out by
right <span id="fr_6884"></span>[6885](#fn_6884.md) of our conduct. Upon
us, who are of an imperfect nature, <span
id="fr_6885"></span>[6886](#fn_6885.md) is imprinted the mark of this
(animal) seed, because we are reckoned *as sprung* from the loves of
Theletus, <span id="fr_6886"></span>[6887](#fn_6886.md) and consequently as
an abortion, just as their mother was. But *woe* to us indeed, should we
in any point transgress the yoke of discipline, should we grow dull in
the works of holiness and justice, should we desire to make our
confession anywhere else, I know not where, and not before the powers of
this world at the tribunals of the chief magistrates! <span
id="fr_6887"></span>[6888](#fn_6887.md) As for them, however, they may
prove their nobility by the dissoluteness <span
id="fr_6888"></span>[6889](#fn_6888.md) of their life and their
diligence <span id="fr_6889"></span>[6890](#fn_6889.md) in sin, since
Achamoth fawns on them as her own; for she, too, found sin no
unprofitable pursuit. Now it is held amongst them, that, for the purpose
of honouring the celestial <span id="page_518">p. 518</span> <span
id="v.vi.xxx-Page_518"></span>marriages, <span
id="fr_6890"></span>[6891](#fn_6890.md) it is necessary to contemplate and
celebrate the mystery always by cleaving to a companion, that, is to a
woman; otherwise (they account any man) degenerate, and a bastard <span
id="fr_6891"></span>[6892](#fn_6891.md) to the truth, who spends his life
in the world without loving a woman or uniting himself to her. Then what
is to become of the eunuchs whom we see amongst them?
