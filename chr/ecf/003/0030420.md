<span id="v.iv.v.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Christ’s Connection with the
Creator Shown from Several Incidents in the Old Testament, Compared with
St. Luke’s Narrative of the Mission of the Disciples. The Feeding of the
Multitude. The Confession of St. Peter. Being Ashamed of Christ. This
Shame is Only Possible of the True Christ. Marcionite Pretensions
Absurd.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxi-p2"></span>He sends forth His disciples to preach
the kingdom of God. <span id="fr_4256"></span>[4257](#fn_4256.md) Does He
here say of what God? He forbids their taking anything for their
journey, by way of either food or raiment.  Who would have given such a
commandment as this, but He who feeds the ravens and clothes <span
id="fr_4257"></span>[4258](#fn_4257.md) the flowers of the field? Who
anciently enjoined for the treading ox an unmuzzled mouth, <span
id="fr_4258"></span>[4259](#fn_4258.md) that he might be at liberty to
gather his fodder from his labour, on the principle that the worker is
worthy of his hire? <span id="fr_4259"></span>[4260](#fn_4259.md) Marcion
may expunge such precepts, but no matter, provided the sense of them
survives.  But when He charges them to shake off the dust of their feet
against such as should refuse to receive them, He also bids that this be
done as a *witness*.  Now no one bears witness except in a case which is
decided by judicial process; and whoever orders inhuman conduct to be
submitted to the trial by testi<span id="page_381">p. 381</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxi-Page_381"></span>mony, <span
id="fr_4260"></span>[4261](#fn_4260.md) does really threaten as a judge.
Again, that it was no new god which recommended <span
id="fr_4261"></span>[4262](#fn_4261.md) by Christ, was clearly attested by
the opinion of all men, because some maintained to Herod that Jesus was
the Christ; others, that He was John; some, that He was Elias; and
others, that He was one of the old prophets. <span
id="fr_4262"></span>[4263](#fn_4262.md) Now, whosoever of all these He
might have been, He certainly was not raised up for the purpose of
announcing another god after His resurrection. He feeds the multitude in
the desert place; <span id="fr_4263"></span>[4264](#fn_4263.md) this, you
must know <span id="fr_4264"></span>[4265](#fn_4264.md) was after the
manner of the Old Testament. <span id="fr_4265"></span>[4266](#fn_4265.md)
Or else, <span id="fr_4266"></span>[4267](#fn_4266.md) if there was not the
same grandeur, it follows that He is now inferior to the Creator. For
*He*, not for one day, but during forty years, not on the inferior
aliment of bread and fish, but with the manna of heaven, supported the
lives <span id="fr_4267"></span>[4268](#fn_4267.md) of not five thousand,
but of six hundred thousand human beings. However, such was the
greatness *of His miracle*, that He willed the slender supply of food,
not only to be enough, but even to prove superabundant; <span
id="fr_4268"></span>[4269](#fn_4268.md) and herein He followed the ancient
precedent.  For in like manner, during the famine in Elijah’s time, the
scanty and final meal of the widow of Sarepta was multiplied <span
id="fr_4269"></span>[4270](#fn_4269.md) by the blessing of the prophet
throughout the period of the famine. You have the third book of the
Kings. <span id="fr_4270"></span>[4271](#fn_4270.md) If you also turn to
the fourth book, you will discover all this conduct <span
id="fr_4271"></span>[4272](#fn_4271.md) of Christ pursued by that man of
God, who ordered ten <span id="fr_4272"></span>[4273](#fn_4272.md) barley
loaves which had been given him to be distributed among the people; and
when his servitor, after contrasting the large number of the persons
with the small supply of the food, answered, “What, shall I set this
before a hundred men?” he said again, “Give them, and they shall eat:
for thus saith the Lord, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof,
according to the word of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_4273"></span>[4274](#fn_4273.md) O Christ, even in Thy novelties
Thou art old! Accordingly, when Peter, who had been an eye-witness of
the miracle, and had compared it with the ancient precedents, and had
discovered in them prophetic intimations of what should one day come to
pass, answered (as the mouthpiece of them all) the Lord’s inquiry, “Whom
say ye that I am?” <span id="fr_4274"></span>[4275](#fn_4274.md) in the
words, “Thou art the Christ,” he could not but have perceived that He
was that Christ, beside whom he knew of none else in the Scriptures, and
whom he was now surveying <span id="fr_4275"></span>[4276](#fn_4275.md) in
His wonderful deeds. This conclusion He even Himself confirms by thus
far bearing with it, nay, even enjoining silence respecting it. <span
id="fr_4276"></span>[4277](#fn_4276.md) For if Peter was unable to
acknowledge Him to be any other than the Creator’s *Christ*, while He
commanded them “to tell no man that saying,” surely <span
id="fr_4277"></span>[4278](#fn_4277.md) He was unwilling to have the
conclusion promulged which Peter had drawn. No doubt of that, <span
id="fr_4278"></span>[4279](#fn_4278.md) you say; but as Peter’s conclusion
was a wrong one, therefore He was unwilling to have a lie disseminated.
It was, however, a different reason which He assigned for the silence,
even because “the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of
the elders, and scribes, and priests, and be slain, and be raised again
the third day.” <span id="fr_4279"></span>[4280](#fn_4279.md) Now, inasmuch
as these *sufferings* were actually foretold for the Creator’s Christ
(as we shall fully show in the proper place <span
id="fr_4280"></span>[4281](#fn_4280) .md), so by this application of them
to His own case <span id="fr_4281"></span>[4282](#fn_4281.md) does He prove
that it is He Himself of whom they were predicted. At all events, even
if they had not been predicted, the reason which He alleged for imposing
silence (on the disciples) was such as made it clear enough that Peter
had made no mistake, that reason being the necessity of His undergoing
these sufferings. “Whosoever,” says He, “will save his life, shall lose
it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save
it.” <span id="fr_4282"></span>[4283](#fn_4282.md) Surely <span
id="fr_4283"></span>[4284](#fn_4283.md) it is the Son of man <span
id="fr_4284"></span>[4285](#fn_4284.md) who uttered this sentence. Look
carefully, then, along with the king of Babylon, into his burning fiery
furnace, and there you will discover one “like the Son of man” (for He
was not yet really Son of man, because not yet born of man), even as
early as then <span id="fr_4285"></span>[4286](#fn_4285.md) appointing
issues such as these. He saved the lives of the three brethren, <span
id="fr_4286"></span>[4287](#fn_4286.md) who had agreed to lose them for
God’s sake; but He destroyed those of the Chaldæans, when they had
preferred to save them by the means of their idolatry. Where is that
novelty, which you pretend <span id="fr_4287"></span>[4288](#fn_4287.md) in
a doctrine which possesses these ancient proofs? But all the predictions
have been fulfilled <span id="fr_4288"></span>[4289](#fn_4288.md)
concerning martyrdoms which were to happen, and were to receive <span
id="page_382">p. 382</span> <span id="v.iv.v.xxi-Page_382"></span>the
recompenses of their reward from God. “See,” says Isaiah, “how the
righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and just men are
taken away, and no man considereth.” <span
id="fr_4289"></span>[4290](#fn_4289.md) When does this more frequently
happen than in the persecution of His saints? This, indeed, is no
ordinary matter, <span id="fr_4290"></span>[4291](#fn_4290.md) no common
casualty of the law of nature; but it is that illustrious devotion, that
fighting for the faith, wherein whosoever loses his life for God saves
it, so that you may here again recognize the Judge who recompenses the
evil gain of life with its destruction, and the good loss thereof with
its salvation. It is, however, a jealous God whom He here presents to
me; one who returns evil for evil.  “For whosoever,” says He, “shall be
ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.” <span
id="fr_4291"></span>[4292](#fn_4291.md) Now to none but my Christ can be
assigned the occasion <span id="fr_4292"></span>[4293](#fn_4292.md) of such
a shame as this. His whole course <span
id="fr_4293"></span>[4294](#fn_4293.md) was so exposed to shame as to open
a way for even the taunts of heretics, declaiming <span
id="fr_4294"></span>[4295](#fn_4294.md) with all the bitterness in their
power against the utter disgrace <span
id="fr_4295"></span>[4296](#fn_4295.md) of His birth and bringing-up, and
the unworthiness of His very flesh. <span
id="fr_4296"></span>[4297](#fn_4296.md) But how can that Christ of yours be
liable to a shame, which it is impossible for him to experience? Since
he was never condensed <span id="fr_4297"></span>[4298](#fn_4297.md) into
human flesh in the womb of a woman, although a virgin; never grew from
human seed, although only after the law of corporeal substance, from the
fluids <span id="fr_4298"></span>[4299](#fn_4298.md) of a woman; was never
deemed flesh before shaped in the womb; never called *fœtus* <span
id="fr_4299"></span>[4300](#fn_4299.md) after such shaping; was never
delivered from a ten months’ writhing in the womb; <span
id="fr_4300"></span>[4301](#fn_4300.md) was never shed forth upon the
ground, amidst the sudden pains of parturition, with the unclean issue
which flows at such a time through the sewerage of the body, forthwith
to inaugurate the light <span id="fr_4301"></span>[4302](#fn_4301.md) of
life with tears, and with that primal wound which severs the child from
her who bears him; <span id="fr_4302"></span>[4303](#fn_4302.md) never
received the copious ablution, nor the meditation of salt and
honey; <span id="fr_4303"></span>[4304](#fn_4303.md) nor did he initiate a
shroud with swaddling clothes; <span
id="fr_4304"></span>[4305](#fn_4304.md) nor afterwards did he ever
wallow <span id="fr_4305"></span>[4306](#fn_4305.md) in his own
uncleanness, in his mother’s lap; nibbling at her breast; long an
infant; gradually <span id="fr_4306"></span>[4307](#fn_4306.md) a boy; by
slow degrees <span id="fr_4307"></span>[4308](#fn_4307.md) a man. <span
id="fr_4308"></span>[4309](#fn_4308.md) But he was revealed <span
id="fr_4309"></span>[4310](#fn_4309.md) from heaven, full-grown at once, at
once complete; immediately Christ; simply spirit, and power, and god.
But as withal he was not true, because not visible; therefore he was no
object to be ashamed of from the curse of the cross, the real
endurance <span id="fr_4310"></span>[4311](#fn_4310.md) of which he
escaped, because wanting in bodily substance. Never, therefore, could he
have said, “Whosoever shall be ashamed of me.” But as for our Christ, He
could do no otherwise than make such a declaration; <span
id="fr_4311"></span>[4312](#fn_4311.md) “made” by the Father “a little
lower than the angels,” <span id="fr_4312"></span>[4313](#fn_4312.md) “a
worm and no man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people;” <span
id="fr_4313"></span>[4314](#fn_4313.md) seeing that it was His will that
“with His stripes we should be healed,” <span
id="fr_4314"></span>[4315](#fn_4314.md) that by His humiliation our
salvation should be established. And justly did He humble Himself <span
id="fr_4315"></span>[4316](#fn_4315.md) for His own creature man, for the
image and likeness of Himself, and not of another, in order that man,
since he had not felt ashamed when bowing down to a stone or a stock,
might with similar courage give satisfaction to God for the
shamelessness of his idolatry, by displaying an equal degree of
shamelessness in his faith, in not being ashamed of Christ.  Now,
Marcion, which of these courses is better suited to your Christ, in
respect of a meritorious shame? <span
id="fr_4316"></span>[4317](#fn_4316.md) Plainly, you ought yourself to
blush with shame for having given him a fictitious existence. <span
id="fr_4317"></span>[4318](#fn_4317.md)

*doctrina* of the sentence just previous. Perhaps, however,
“*persecutione*” is the noun.

<span id="v.iv.v.xxi-p43"></span> Ipsius etiam carnis indignitatem;
because His flesh, being capable of suffering and subject to death,
seemed to them unworthy of God. So *Adv. Judæos*, chap. xiv., he says:
“Primo sordidis indutus est, id est carnis passibilis et mortalis
indignitate.” Or His “indignity” may have been <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.v.xxi-p43.1"></span>εἶδος οὐκ ἄξιον τυραννίδος</span>, His
“*unkingly aspect*” (as Origen expresses it, *Contra Celsum*, 6); His
“form of a servant,” or slave, as St. Paul says. See also Tertullian’s
*De Patientia*, iii. (Rigalt.)

<span id="v.iv.v.xxi-p46"></span> Pecus. Julius Firmicus, iii. 1, uses
the word in the same way: “*Pecus* intra viscera matris artuatim
concisum a medicis proferetur.” \[Jul. Firmicus Maternus, floruit
*circa*, <span class="sc"><span id="v.iv.v.xxi-p46.2"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxi-p47"></span> Such is probably the meaning of “non
decem mensium cruciatu deliberatus.” For such is the situation of the
infant in the womb, that it seems to writhe (*cruciari*) all curved and
contracted (Rigalt.). Latinius read *delibratus* instead of
*deliberatus*, which means, “suspended or poised in the womb as in a
scale.” This has my approbation. I would compare *De Carne Christi*,
chap. iv. (Fr. Junius). Oehler reads *deliberatus* in the sense of
*liberatus*.
