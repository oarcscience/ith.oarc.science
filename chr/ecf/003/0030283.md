<span id="v.iii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Heretics, in Fact, Do Not Use,
But Only Abuse, Scripture. No Common Ground Between Them and You.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xvii-p2"></span>Now this heresy of yours <span
id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033) does not receive certain
Scriptures; and whichever of them it does receive, it perverts by means
of additions and diminutions, for the accomplishment of it own purpose;
and such as it does receive, it receives not in their entirety; but even
when it does receive any up to a certain point <span
id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034) as entire, it nevertheless perverts
even these by the contrivance of diverse interpretations. Truth is just
as much opposed by an adulteration of its meaning as it is by a
corruption of its text. <span id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035) Their
vain presumptions must needs refuse to acknowledge the (writings)
whereby they are refuted. They rely on those which they have falsely put
together, and which they have selected, because of <span
id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036) their ambiguity. Though most
skilled <span id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037) in the Scriptures,
you will make no progress, <span id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038)
when everything which you maintain is denied on the other side, and
whatever you deny is (by them) maintained. As for yourself, indeed, you
will lose nothing but your breath, and gain nothing but vexation from
their blasphemy.
