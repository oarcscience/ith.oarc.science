<span id="v.iv.iii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—The Minute Prescriptions of
the Law Meant to Keep the People Dependent on God. The Prophets Sent by
God in Pursuance of His Goodness.  Many Beautiful Passages from Them
Quoted in Illustration of This Attribute.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xix-p2"></span>But even in the common transactions of
life, and of human intercourse at home and in public, even to the care
of the smallest vessels, He in every possible manner made distinct
arrangement; in order that, when they everywhere encountered these legal
instructions, they might not be at any moment out of the sight of God.
For what could better tend to make a man happy, than having “his delight
in the law of the Lord?” “In that law would he meditate day and
night.” <span id="fr_2921"></span>[2922](#fn_2921.md) It was not in
severity that its Author promulgated this law, but in the interest of
the highest benevolence, which rather aimed at subduing <span
id="fr_2922"></span>[2923](#fn_2922.md) the nation’s hardness of heart, and
by laborious services hewing out a fealty which was (as yet) untried in
obedience:  for I purposely abstain from touching on the mysterious
senses of the law, considered in its spiritual and prophetic relation,
and as abounding in types of almost every variety and sort.  It is
enough at present, that it simply bound a man to God, so that no one
ought to find fault with it, except him who does not choose to serve
God. To help forward this beneficent, not onerous, purpose of the law,
the prophets were also ordained by the self-same goodness of God,
teaching precepts worthy of God, how that men should “cease to do evil,
learn to do well, seek judgment, judge the fatherless, <span
id="fr_2923"></span>[2924](#fn_2923.md) and plead for the widow:” <span
id="fr_2924"></span>[2925](#fn_2924.md) be fond of the divine
expostulations: <span id="fr_2925"></span>[2926](#fn_2925.md) avoid contact
with the wicked: <span id="fr_2926"></span>[2927](#fn_2926.md) “let the
oppressed go free:” <span id="fr_2927"></span>[2928](#fn_2927.md) dismiss
the unjust sentence, <span id="fr_2928"></span>[2929](#fn_2928.md) “deal
their bread to the hungry; bring the outcast into their house; cover the
naked, when they see him; nor hide themselves from their own flesh and
kin:” <span id="fr_2929"></span>[2930](#fn_2929.md) “keep their tongue from
evil, and their lips from speaking guile: depart from evil, and do good;
seek peace, and pursue it:” <span id="fr_2930"></span>[2931](#fn_2930.md)
be angry, and sin not; that is, not persevere in anger, or be
enraged: <span id="fr_2931"></span>[2932](#fn_2931.md) “walk not in the
counsel of the ungodly; nor stand in the way of sinners; nor sit in the
seat of the scornful.” <span id="fr_2932"></span>[2933](#fn_2932.md) Where
then?  “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
together in unity;” <span id="fr_2933"></span>[2934](#fn_2933.md)
meditating (as they do) day and night in the law of the Lord, because
“it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man; better
to hope in the Lord than in man.” <span
id="fr_2934"></span>[2935](#fn_2934.md) For what recompense shall man
receive from God? “He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of
water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall
not wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.” <span
id="fr_2935"></span>[2936](#fn_2935.md) “He that hath clean hands and a
pure heart, who hath not taken God’s name in vain, nor sworn deceitfully
to his neighbour, he shall receive blessing from the Lord, and mercy
from the God of his salvation.” <span
id="fr_2936"></span>[2937](#fn_2936.md) “For the eyes of the Lord are upon
them that fear Him, upon them that hope in His mercy, to deliver their
souls from death,” even eternal death, “and to nourish them in their
hunger,” that is, after eternal life. <span
id="fr_2937"></span>[2938](#fn_2937.md) “Many are the afflictions of the
righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of them all.” <span
id="fr_2938"></span>[2939](#fn_2938.md) “Precious in the sight of the Lord
is the death of His saints.” <span id="fr_2939"></span>[2940](#fn_2939.md)
“The Lord keepeth all their bones; not one of them shall be
broken.” <span id="fr_2940"></span>[2941](#fn_2940.md) The Lord will redeem
the souls of His servants. <span id="fr_2941"></span>[2942](#fn_2941.md) We
have adduced these few quotations from a mass of the Creator’s
Scriptures; and no more, I suppose, are wanted to prove Him to be a most
good God, for they sufficiently indicate both the precepts of His
goodness and the first-fruits <span id="fr_2942"></span>[2943](#fn_2942.md)
thereof.
