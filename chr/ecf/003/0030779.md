id="vi.v.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.</span>

<span id="vi.v.v-p2"></span>I leave out of account now the motive of
glory. All these same cruel and painful conflicts, a mere vanity you
find among men—in fact, a sort of mental disease—as trampled under
foot.  How many ease-lovers does the conceit of arms give to the sword?
They actually go down to meet the very wild beasts in vain ambition; and
they fancy themselves more winsome from the bites and scars of the
contest. Some have sold themselves to fires, to run a certain distance
in a burning tunic. Others, with most enduring shoulders, have walked
about under the hunters’ whips.  The Lord has given these things a place
in the world, O blessed, not without some reason: for what reason, but
*now* to animate us, and on that day to confound us if we have feared to
suffer for the truth, that we might be saved, what others out of vanity
have eagerly sought for to their ruin?
