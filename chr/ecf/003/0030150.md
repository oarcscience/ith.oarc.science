<span id="iv.viii.i.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X. <span
id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603.md) —The Christians are Not the Only
Contemners of the Gods. Contempt of Them Often Displayed by Heathen
Official Persons. Homer Made the Gods Contemptible.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.x-p3"></span>Pour out now all your venom; fling
against this name of ours all your shafts of calumny: I shall stay no
longer to refute them; but they shall by and by be blunted, when we come
to explain our entire discipline. <span
id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604.md) I shall content myself now indeed with
plucking these shafts out of our own body, and hurling them back on
yourselves. The same wounds which you have inflicted on us by your
charges I shall show to be imprinted on yourselves, that you may fall by
your own swords and javelins. <span id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605.md)
Now, first, when you direct against us the general charge of divorcing
ourselves from the institutions of our forefathers, consider again and
again whether you are not yourselves open to that accusation in common
with us. For when I look through your life and customs, lo, what do I
discover but the old order of things corrupted, nay, destroyed by you? 
Of the laws I have already said, that you are daily supplanting them
with novel decrees and statutes. As to everything else in your manner of
life, how great are the changes you have made from your ancestors—in
your style, your dress, your equipage, your very food, and even in your
speech; for the old-fashioned you banish, as if it were offensive to
you! Everywhere, in your public pursuits and private duties, antiquity
is repealed; all the authority of your forefathers your own authority
has superseded. To be sure, <span id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606.md) you
are for ever praising old customs; but this is only to your greater
discredit, for you nevertheless persistently reject them. How great must
your perverseness have been, to have bestowed approbation on your
ancestors’ institutions, which were too inefficient to be lasting, all
the while that you were rejecting the very objects of your approbation!
But even that very heir-loom <span id="fr_607"></span>[608](#fn_607.md) of
your forefathers, which you seem to guard and defend with greatest
fidelity, in which you actually <span id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608.md)
find your strongest grounds for impeaching us as violators of the law,
and from which your hatred of the Christian name derives all its life—I
mean the worship of the gods—I shall prove to be undergoing ruin and
contempt from yourselves no less than <span
id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609) (from us.md),—unless it be that there is
no reason for our being regarded as despisers of the gods like
yourselves, on the ground that nobody despises what he knows has
absolutely no existence.  What certainly exists can be despised.  That
which *is* nothing, suffers nothing. From those, therefore, to whom it
is an existing thing, <span id="fr_610"></span>[611](#fn_610.md) must
necessarily proceed the suffering which affects it. All the heavier,
then, is the accusation which burdens you who believe that there are
gods and (at the same time) despise them, who worship and also reject
them, who honour and also assail them. One may also gather the same
conclusion from this consideration, above all:  since you worship
various gods, some one and some another, you of course despise those
which you do not worship.  A preference for the one is not possible
without slighting the other, and no choice can be made without a
rejection.  He who selects some *one* out of many, has already slighted
the other which he does not select. But it is impossible that so many
and so great gods can be worshipped by all.  Then you must have
exercised your contempt (in this matter) even at the beginning, since
indeed you were not then afraid of so ordering things, that all the gods
could not become objects of worship to all. For those very wise and
prudent ancestors of yours, whose institutions you know not how to
repeal, especially in respect of your gods, are themselves found to have
been impious. I am much mistaken, if they did not sometimes decree that
no general should dedicate a temple, which he may have vowed in battle,
before the senate gave its sanction; as in the case of Marcus Æmilius,
who had made <span id="page_119">p. 119</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.x-Page_119"></span>a vow to the god Alburnus. Now is it
not confessedly the greatest impiety, nay, the greatest insult, to place
the honour of the Deity at the will and pleasure of human judgment, so
that there cannot be a god except the senate permit him? Many times have
the censors destroyed <span id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611) (a god.md)
without consulting the people.  Father Bacchus, with all his ritual, was
certainly by the consuls, on the senate’s authority, cast not only out
of the city, but out of all Italy; whilst Varro informs us that Serapis
also, and Isis, and Arpocrates, and Anubis, were excluded from the
Capitol, and that their altars which the senate had thrown down were
only restored by the popular violence. The Consul Gabinius, however, on
the first day of the ensuing January, although he gave a tardy consent
to some sacrifices, in deference to the crowd which assembled, because
he had failed to decide about Serapis and Isis, yet held the judgment of
the senate to be more potent than the clamour of the multitude, and
forbade the altars to be built. Here, then, you have amongst your own
forefathers, if not the name, at all events the procedure, <span
id="fr_612"></span>[613](#fn_612.md) of the Christians, which despises the
gods.  If, however, you were even innocent of the charge of treason
against them in the honour you pay them, I still find that you have made
a consistent advance in superstition as well as impiety.  For how much
more irreligious are you found to be! There are your household gods, the
Lares and the Penates, which you possess <span
id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613.md) by a family consecration: <span
id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614.md) you even tread them profanely under
foot, you and your domestics, by hawking and pawning them for your wants
or your whims. Such insolent sacrilege might be excusable, if it were
not practised against your humbler deities; as it is, the case is only
the more insolent. There is, however, some consolation for your private
household gods under these affronts, that you treat your public deities
with still greater indignity and insolence. First of all, you advertise
them for auction, submit them to public sale, knock them down to the
highest bidder, when you every five years bring them to the hammer among
your revenues. For this purpose you frequent the temple of Serapis or
the Capitol, hold your sales there, <span
id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615.md) conclude your contracts, <span
id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616.md) as if they were markets, with the
well-known <span id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617.md) voice of the crier,
(and) the self-same levy <span id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618.md) of the
quæstor. Now lands become cheaper when burdened with tribute, and men by
the capitation tax diminish in value (these are the well-known marks of
slavery).  But the gods, the more tribute they pay, become more holy; or
rather, <span id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619.md) the more holy they are,
the more tribute do they pay. Their majesty is converted into an article
of traffic; men drive a business with their religion; the sanctity of
the gods is beggared with sales and contracts. You make merchandise of
the ground of your temples, of the approach to your altars, of your
offerings, <span id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620.md) of your
sacrifices. <span id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621.md) You sell the whole
divinity (of your gods). You will not permit their gratuitous worship.
The auctioneers necessitate more repairs <span
id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622.md) than the priests.

<span id="iv.viii.i.x-p23"></span>It was not enough that you had
insolently made a profit of your gods, if we would test the amount of
your contempt; and you are not content to have withheld honour from
them, you must also depreciate the little you do render to them by some
indignity or other. What, indeed, do you do by way of honouring your
gods, which you do not equally offer to your dead? You build temples for
the gods, you erect temples also to the dead; you build altars for the
gods, you build them also for the dead; you inscribe the same
superscription over both; you sketch out the same lineaments for their
statues—as best suits their genius, or profession, or age; you make an
old man of Saturn, a beardless youth of Apollo; you form a virgin from
Diana; in Mars you consecrate a soldier, a blacksmith in Vulcan. No
wonder, therefore, if you slay the same victims and burn the same odours
for your dead as you do for your gods. What excuse can be found for that
insolence which classes the dead of whatever sort <span
id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623.md) as equal with the gods? Even to your
princes there are assigned the services of priests and sacred
ceremonies, and chariots, <span id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624.md) and
cars, and the honours of the *solisternia* and the *lectisternia*,
holidays and games. Rightly enough, <span
id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625.md) since heaven is open to them; still it
is none the less contumelious to the gods: in the first place, because
it could not possibly be decent that other beings should be numbered
with them, even if it has been given to them to become divine after
their birth; in the second place, because the witness who beheld the man
caught up into heaven <span id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626.md) would not
forswear himself so freely and palpably before the people, if it were
not for the con<span id="page_120">p. 120</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.x-Page_120"></span>tempt felt about the objects sworn to
both by himself and those <span id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627.md) who
allow the perjury. For these feel of themselves, that what is sworn to
is nothing; and more than that, they go so far as to fee the witness,
because he had the courage to publicly despise the avengers of perjury.
Now, as to that, who among you is pure of the charge of perjury?  By
this time, indeed, there is an end to all danger in swearing by the
gods, since the oath by Cæsar carries with it more influential scruples,
which very circumstance indeed tends to the degradation of your gods;
for those who perjure themselves when swearing by Cæsar are more readily
punished than those who violate an oath to a Jupiter. But, of the two
kindred feelings of contempt and derision, contempt is the more
honourable, having a certain glory in its arrogance; for it sometimes
proceeds from confidence, or the security of consciousness, or a natural
loftiness of mind. Derision, however, is a more wanton feeling, and so
far it points more directly <span id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628.md) to a
carping insolence. Now only consider what great deriders of your gods
you show yourselves to be! I say nothing of your indulgence of this
feeling during your sacrificial acts, how you offer for your victims the
poorest and most emaciated creatures; or else of the sound and healthy
animals only the portions which are useless for food, such as the heads
and hoofs, or the plucked feathers and hair, and whatever at home you
would have thrown away. I pass over whatever may seem to the taste <span
id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629.md) of the vulgar and profane to have
constituted the religion <span id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630.md) of your
forefathers; but then the most learned and serious classes (for
seriousness and wisdom to some extent <span
id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631.md) profess <span
id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632) to be derived from learning.md) are
always, in fact, the most irreverent towards your gods; and if their
learning ever halts, it is only to make up for the remissness by a more
shameful invention of follies and falsehoods about their gods. I will
begin with that enthusiastic fondness which you show for him from whom
every depraved writer gets his dreams, to whom you ascribe as much
honour as you derogate from your gods, by magnifying him who has made
such sport of them. I mean Homer by this description. He it is, in my
opinion, who has treated the majesty of the Divine Being on the low
level of human condition, imbuing the gods with the falls <span
id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633.md) and the passions of men; who has
pitted them against each other with varying success, like pairs of
gladiators: he wounds Venus with an arrow from a human hand; he keeps
Mars a prisoner in chains for thirteen months, with the prospect of
perishing; <span id="fr_634"></span>[635](#fn_634.md) he parades <span
id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635.md) Jupiter as suffering a like indignity
from a crowd of celestial (rebels;) or he draws from him tears for
Sarpedon; or he represents him wantoning with Juno in the most
disgraceful way, advocating his incestuous passion for her by a
description and enumeration of his various amours. Since then, which of
the poets has not, on the authority of their great prince, calumniated
the gods, by either betraying truth or feigning falsehood? Have the
dramatists also, whether in tragedy or comedy, refrained from making the
gods the authors <span id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636.md) of the
calamities and retributions (of their plays)? I say nothing of your
philosophers, whom a certain inspiration of truth itself elevates
against the gods, and secures from all fear in their proud severity and
stern discipline. Take, for example, <span
id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637.md) Socrates. In contempt of your gods, he
swears by an oak, and a dog, and a goat.  Now, although he was condemned
to die for this very reason, the Athenians afterwards repented of that
condemnation, and even put to death his accusers. By this conduct of
theirs the testimony of Socrates is replaced at its full value, and I am
enabled to meet you with this retort, that in his case you have
approbation bestowed on that which is now-a-days reprobated in us.  But
besides this instance there is Diogenes, who, I know not to what extent,
made sport of Hercules; whilst Varro, that Diogenes of the Roman
cut, <span id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md) introduces to our view some
three hundred Joves, or, as they ought to be called, Jupiters, <span
id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639) (and all.md) without heads. Your other
wanton wits <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md) likewise minister to
your pleasures by disgracing the gods. Examine carefully the
sacrilegious <span id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md) beauties of your
Lentuli and Hostii; now, is it the players or your gods who become the
objects of your mirth in their tricks and jokes? Then, again, with what
pleasure do you take up the literature of the stage, which describes all
the foul conduct of the gods! Their majesty is defiled in your presence
in some unchaste body. The mask of some deity, at your will, <span
id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) covers some infamous paltry head. The
Sun mourns for the death of his son by a lightning-flash amid your rude
rejoicing. <span id="page_121">p. 121</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.x-Page_121"></span>Cybele sighs for a shepherd who
disdains her, without raising a blush on your cheek; and you quietly
endure songs which celebrate <span id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) the
gallantries of Jove. You are, of course, possessed of a more religious
spirit in the show of your gladiators, when your gods dance, with equal
zest, over the spilling of human blood, (and) over those filthy
penalties which are at once their proof and plot for executing your
criminals, or else (when) your criminals are punished personating the
gods themselves. <span id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) We have often
witnessed in a mutilated criminal your god of Pessinum, Attis; a wretch
burnt alive has personated Hercules. We have laughed at the sport of
your mid-day game of the gods, when Father Pluto, Jove’s own brother,
drags away, hammer in hand, the remains of the gladiators; when Mercury,
with his winged cap and heated wand, tests with his cautery whether the
bodies were really lifeless, or only feigning death.  Who now can
investigate every particular of this sort although so destructive of the
honour of the Divine Being, and so humiliating to His majesty? They all,
indeed, have their origin <span id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) in a
contempt (of the gods), on the part both of those who practise <span
id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) these personations, as well as of
those <span id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md) who are susceptible of
being so represented. <span id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md) I hardly
know, therefore, whether your gods have more reason to complain of
yourselves or of us. After despising them on the one hand, you flatter
them on the other; if you fail in any duty towards them, you appease
them with a fee; <span id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md) in short, you
allow yourselves to act towards them in any way you please. We, however,
live in a consistent and entire aversion to them.

<span id="iv.viii.i.x-p45"></span> It is best to add the original of
this almost unintelligible passage:  “Plane religiosiores estis in
gladiatorum cavea, ubi super sanguinem humanum, supra inquinamenta
pœnarum proinde saltant dei vestri *argumenta et historias nocentibus
erogandis, aut in ipsis deis nocentes puniuntur*.” Some little light may
be derived from the parallel passage of the *Apology* (c. xv.), which is
expressed somewhat less obscurely. Instead of the words in italics,
Tertullian there substitutes these: “Argumenta et historias noxiis
ministrantes, nisi quod et ipsos deos vestros sæpe noxii
induunt”—“whilst furnishing the proofs and the plots for (executing)
criminals, only that the said criminals often act the part of your gods
themselves.”  Oehler refers, in illustration of the last clause, to the
instance of the notorious robber Laureolus, who personated Prometheus;
others, again, personated Laureolus himself: some criminals had to play
the part of Orpheus; others of Mutius Scævola. It will be observed that
these executions were with infamous perverseness set off with scenic
show, wherein the criminal enacted some violent death in yielding up his
own life. The indignant irony of the whole passage, led off by the
“plane religiosiores estis,” is evident.
