<span id="v.iii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—Present Heresies
(Seedlings of the Tares Noted by the Sacred Writers) Already Condemned
in Scripture.  This Descent of Later Heresy from the Earlier Traced in
Several Instances.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxxiii-p2"></span>Besides all this, I add a review of
the doctrines themselves, which, existing as they did <span
id="page_259">p. 259</span> <span id="v.iii.xxxiii-Page_259"></span>in
the days of the apostles, were both exposed and denounced by the said
apostles. For by this method they will be more easily reprobated, <span
id="fr_2190"></span>[2191](#fn_2190.md) when they are detected to have been
even then in existence, or at any rate to have been seedlings <span
id="fr_2191"></span>[2192](#fn_2191) of the (tares.md) which then were.
Paul, in his first epistle to the Corinthians, sets his mark on certain
who denied and doubted the resurrection. <span
id="fr_2192"></span>[2193](#fn_2192.md) This opinion was the especial
property of the Sadducees. <span id="fr_2193"></span>[2194](#fn_2193.md) A
part of it, however, is maintained by Marcion and Apelles and
Valentinus, and all other impugners of the resurrection. Writing also to
the Galatians, he inveighs against such men as observed and defend
circumcision and the (Mosaic) law. <span
id="fr_2194"></span>[2195](#fn_2194.md) Thus runs Hebion’s heresy. Such
also as “forbid to marry” he reproaches in his instructions to
Timothy. <span id="fr_2195"></span>[2196](#fn_2195.md) Now, this is the
teaching of Marcion and his follower Apelles. (The apostle) directs a
similar blow <span id="fr_2196"></span>[2197](#fn_2196.md) against those
who said that “the resurrection was past already.” <span
id="fr_2197"></span>[2198](#fn_2197.md) Such an opinion did the
Valentinians assert of themselves. When again he mentions “endless
genealogies,” <span id="fr_2198"></span>[2199](#fn_2198.md) one also
recognises Valentinus, in whose system a certain Æon, whosoever he
be, <span id="fr_2199"></span>[2200](#fn_2199.md) of a new name, and that
not one only, generates of his own grace <span
id="fr_2200"></span>[2201](#fn_2200.md) Sense and Truth; and these in like
manner produce of themselves Word <span
id="fr_2201"></span>[2202](#fn_2201.md) and Life, while these again
afterwards beget Man and the Church. From these primary eight <span
id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202.md) ten other Æons after them spring,
and then the twelve others arise with their wonderful names, to complete
the mere story of the thirty Æons. The same apostle, when disapproving
of those who are “in bondage to elements,” <span
id="fr_2203"></span>[2204](#fn_2203.md) points us to some dogma of
Hermogenes, who introduces matter as having no beginning, <span
id="fr_2204"></span>[2205](#fn_2204.md) and then compares it with God, who
has no beginning. <span id="fr_2205"></span>[2206](#fn_2205.md) By thus
making the mother of the elements a goddess, he has it in his power “to
be in bondage” to a being which he puts on a par with <span
id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206.md) God. John, however, in the
Apocalypse is charged to chastise those “who eat things sacrificed to
idols,” and “who commit fornication.” <span
id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207.md) There are even now another sort of
Nicolaitans. Theirs is called the Gaian <span
id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208.md) heresy. But in his epistle he
especially designates those as “Antichrists” who “denied that Christ was
come in the flesh,” <span id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209.md) and who
refused to think that Jesus was the Son of God. The one dogma Marcion
maintained; the other, Hebion. <span
id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210.md) The doctrine, however, of Simon’s
sorcery, which inculcated the worship of angels, <span
id="fr_2211"></span>[2212](#fn_2211.md) was itself actually reckoned
amongst idolatries and condemned by the Apostle Peter in Simon’s own
person.
