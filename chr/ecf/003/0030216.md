<span id="iv.xi.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Difference Between the Mind and
the Soul, and the Relation Between Them.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xii-p2"></span>In like manner the mind also, or
*animus*, which the Greeks designate <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xi.xii-p2.1"></span>ΝΟΥΣ</span>, is taken by us in no other sense
than as indicating that faculty or apparatus <span
id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570) which is inherent and implanted in
the soul, and naturally proper to it, whereby it acts, whereby it
acquires knowledge, and by the possession of which it is capable of a
spontaneity of motion within itself, and of thus appearing to be
impelled by the mind, as if it were another substance, as is maintained
by those who determine the soul to be the moving principle of the
universe <span id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571) —the god of
Socrates, Valentinus’ “only-begotten” of his father <span
id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572) *Bythus*, and <span
id="page_192">p. 192</span> <span id="iv.xi.xii-Page_192"></span>his
mother *Sige*.  How confused is the opinion of Anaxagoras! For, having
imagined the mind to be the initiating principle of all things, and
suspending on its axis the balance of the universe; affirming, moreover,
that the mind is a simple principle, unmixed, and incapable of
admixture, he mainly on this very consideration separates it from all
amalgamation with the soul; and yet in another passage he actually
incorporates it with <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573) the
soul. This (inconsistency) Aristotle has also observed: but whether he
meant his criticism to be constructive, and to fill up a system of his
own, rather than destructive of the principles of others, I am hardly
able to decide. As for himself, indeed, although he postpones his
definition of the mind, yet he begins by mentioning, as one of the two
natural constituents of the mind, <span
id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574) that divine principle which he
conjectures to be impassible, or incapable of emotion, and thereby
removes from all association with the soul. For whereas it is evident
that the soul is susceptible of those emotions which it falls to it
naturally to suffer, it must needs suffer either by the mind or with the
mind. Now if the soul is by nature associated with the mind, it is
impossible to draw the conclusion that the mind is impassible; or again,
if the soul suffers not either by the mind or with the mind, it cannot
possibly have a natural association with the mind, with which it suffers
nothing, and which suffers nothing itself.  Moreover, if the soul
suffers nothing by the mind and with the mind, it will experience no
sensation, nor will it acquire any knowledge, nor will it undergo any
emotion through the agency of the mind, as they maintain it will. For
Aristotle makes even the senses passions, or states of emotion.  And
rightly too. For to exercise the senses is to suffer emotion, because to
suffer is to feel. In like manner, to acquire knowledge is to exercise
the senses; and to undergo emotion is to exercise the senses; and the
whole of this is a state of suffering.  But we see that the soul
experiences nothing of these things, in such a manner as that the mind
also is affected by the emotion, by which, indeed, and with which, all
is effected. It follows, therefore, that the mind is capable of
admixture, in opposition to Anaxagoras; and passible or susceptible of
emotion, contrary to the opinion of Aristotle. Besides, if a separate
condition between the soul and mind is to be admitted, so that they be
two things in substance, then of one of them, emotion and sensation, and
every sort of taste, and all action and motion, will be the
characteristics; whilst of the other the natural condition will be calm,
and repose, and stupor. There is therefore no alternative: either the
mind must be useless and void, or the soul. But if these affections may
certainly be all of them ascribed to both, then in that case the two
will be one and the same, and Democritus will carry his point when he
suppresses all distinction between the two. The question will arise how
two can be one—whether by the confusion of two substances, or by the
disposition of one?  We, however, affirm that the mind coalesces
with <span id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575) the soul,—not indeed as
being distinct from it in substance, but as being its natural function
and agent. <span id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576)
