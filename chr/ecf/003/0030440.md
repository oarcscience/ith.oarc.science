<span id="v.iv.v.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLI.—The Woe Pronounced on the
Traitor a Judicial Act, Which Disproves Christ to Be Such as Marcion
Would Have Him to Be. Christ’s Conduct Before the Council Explained.
Christ Even Then Directs the Minds of His Judges to the Prophetic
Evidences of His Own Mission. The Moral Responsibility of These Men
Asserted.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xli-p2"></span>“Woe,” says He, “to that man by whom the
Son of man is betrayed!” <span id="fr_5093"></span>[5094](#fn_5093) Now
it is certain that in this *woe* must be understood the imprecation and
threat of an angry and incensed Master, unless Judas was to escape with
impunity after so vast a sin. If he were meant to escape with impunity,
the *“woe”* was an idle word; if not, he was of course to be punished by
Him against whom he had committed the sin of treachery.  Now, if He
knowingly permitted the man, whom He <span
id="fr_5094"></span>[5095](#fn_5094) deliberately elected to be one of
His companions, to plunge into so great a crime, you must no longer use
an argument against the Creator in Adam’s case, which may now recoil on
your own God: <span id="fr_5095"></span>[5096](#fn_5095) either that he
was *ignorant*, and had no foresight to hinder the future sinner; <span
id="fr_5096"></span>[5097](#fn_5096) or that he was *unable* to hinder
him, even if he was ignorant; <span id="fr_5097"></span>[5098](#fn_5097)
or else that he was *unwilling*, even if he had the foreknowledge and
the ability; and so deserved the stigma of maliciousness, in having
permitted the man of his own choice to perish in his sin. I advise you
therefore (willingly) to acknowledge the Creator in that god of yours,
rather than against your will to be assimilating your excellent god to
Him.  For in the case of Peter, <span
id="fr_5098"></span>[5099](#fn_5098) too, he gives you proof that he is
a jealous God, when he destined the apostle, after his presumptuous
protestations of zeal, to a flat denial of him, rather than *prevent his
fall*. <span id="fr_5099"></span>[5100](#fn_5099) The Christ of the
prophets was destined, moreover, to be betrayed with a kiss, <span
id="fr_5100"></span>[5101](#fn_5100) for He was the Son indeed of Him
who was “honoured *with the lips*” by the people. <span
id="fr_5101"></span>[5102](#fn_5101) When led before the council, He is
asked whether He is the Christ. <span
id="fr_5102"></span>[5103](#fn_5102) Of what Christ could the Jews have
inquired <span id="fr_5103"></span>[5104](#fn_5103) but their own? Why,
therefore, did He not, even at that moment, declare to them the rival
(Christ)? You reply, In order that He might be able to suffer. In other
words, that this most excellent god might plunge men into crime, whom he
was still keeping in ignorance. But even if he had told them, he would
yet have to suffer. For he said, “If I tell you, ye will not
believe.” <span id="fr_5104"></span>[5105](#fn_5104) And refusing to
believe, they would have continued to insist on his death. And would he
not even more probably still have had to suffer, if had announced
himself as sent by the rival god, and as being, therefore, the enemy of
the Creator? It was not, then, in order that He might suffer, that He at
that critical moment refrained from proclaiming <span
id="fr_5105"></span>[5106](#fn_5105) Himself the other *Christ*, but
because they wanted to extort a confession from His mouth, which they
did not mean to believe even if He had given it to them, whereas it was
their bounden duty to have acknowledged Him in consequence of His works,
which were fulfilling their Scriptures. It was thus plainly His course
to keep Himself at that moment unrevealed, <span
id="fr_5106"></span>[5107](#fn_5106) because a spontaneous recognition
was due to Him. But yet for all this, He with a solemn gesture <span
id="fr_5107"></span>[5108](#fn_5107) says, “Hereafter shall the Son of
man sit on the right hand of the power of God.” <span
id="fr_5108"></span>[5109](#fn_5108) For it was on the authority of the
prophecy of Daniel that He intimated to them that He was “the Son of
man,” <span id="fr_5109"></span>[5110](#fn_5109) and of David’s Psalm,
that He would “sit at the right hand of God.” <span
id="fr_5110"></span>[5111](#fn_5110) Accordingly, after He had said
this, and so suggested a comparison of the Scripture, a ray of light did
seem to show them whom He would have them understand Him to be; for they
say: “Art thou then the Son of God?” <span
id="fr_5111"></span>[5112](#fn_5111) Of what God, but of Him whom alone
they knew? Of what God but of Him whom they remembered in the Psalm as
having said to <span id="page_420">p. 420</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xli-Page_420"></span>His Son, “Sit Thou on my right hand?”
Then He answered, “Ye say that I am;” <span
id="fr_5112"></span>[5113](#fn_5112) as if He meant: It is *ye* who say
this—not I. But at the same time He allowed Himself to be all that they
had said, in this their second question. <span
id="fr_5113"></span>[5114](#fn_5113) By what means, however, are you
going to prove to us that they pronounced the sentence “*Ergo tu filius
Dei es*” interrogatively, and not affirmatively? <span
id="fr_5114"></span>[5115](#fn_5114) Just as, (on the one hand,) because
He had shown them in an indirect manner, <span
id="fr_5115"></span>[5116](#fn_5115) by passages of Scripture, that they
ought to regard Him as the Son of God, they therefore meant their own
words, “Thou art then the Son of God,” to be taken in a like (indirect)
sense, <span id="fr_5116"></span>[5117](#fn_5116) as much as to say,
“You do not wish to say this of yourself plainly,” <span
id="fr_5117"></span>[5118](#fn_5117) so, (on the other hand,) He
likewise answered them, “Ye say that I am,” in a sense equally free from
doubt, even affirmatively; <span id="fr_5118"></span>[5119](#fn_5118)
and so completely was His statement to this effect, that they insisted
on accepting that sense which His statement indicated. <span
id="fr_5119"></span>[5120](#fn_5119)
