<span id="v.vi.i-p6"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.i-p6.1"></span>Chapter I.—Introductory. Tertullian Compares the
Heresy to the Old Eleusinian Mysteries.  Both Systems Alike in
Preferring Concealment of Error and Sin to Proclamation of Truth and
Virtue.</span>

<span id="v.vi.i-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.vi.i-p7.1"></span>The</span> Valentinians, who are no doubt a very
large body of heretics—comprising as they do so many apostates from the
truth, who have a propensity for fables, and no discipline to deter them
(therefrom) care for nothing so much as to obscure <span
id="fr_6610"></span>[6611](#fn_6610.md) what they preach, if indeed they
(can be said to) preach who obscure *their doctrine*. The officiousness
with which they guard their doctrine is an officiousness which betrays
their guilt. <span id="fr_6611"></span>[6612](#fn_6611.md) Their disgrace
is proclaimed in the very earnestness with which they maintain their
religious system. Now, in the case of those Eleusinian mysteries, which
are the very heresy of Athenian superstition, it is their secrecy that
is their disgrace. Accordingly, they previously beset all access to
their body with tormenting conditions; <span
id="fr_6612"></span>[6613](#fn_6612.md) *and* they require a long
initiation before they enrol (their members), <span
id="fr_6613"></span>[6614](#fn_6613.md) even instruction during five years
for their perfect disciples, <span id="fr_6614"></span>[6615](#fn_6614.md)
in order that they may mould <span id="fr_6615"></span>[6616](#fn_6615.md)
their opinions by this suspension of full knowledge, and apparently
raise the dignity of their mysteries in proportion to the craving for
them which they have previously created. Then follows the duty of
silence. Carefully is that guarded, which is so long in finding.  All
the divinity, however, lies in their secret recesses: <span
id="fr_6616"></span>[6617](#fn_6616.md) there are revealed *at last* all
the aspirations of the fully initiated, <span
id="fr_6617"></span>[6618](#fn_6617.md) the entire mystery of the sealed
tongue, the symbol of virility. But this allegorical
representation, <span id="fr_6618"></span>[6619](#fn_6618.md) under the
pretext of nature’s reverend name, obscures a real sacrilege by help of
an arbitrary symbol, <span id="fr_6619"></span>[6620](#fn_6619.md) and by
*empty* images obviates <span id="fr_6620"></span>[6621](#fn_6620.md) the
reproach of falsehood! <span id="fr_6621"></span>[6622](#fn_6621.md) In
like manner, the heretics who are now the object of our remarks, <span
id="fr_6622"></span>[6623](#fn_6622.md) the Valentinians, have formed
Eleusinian dissipations <span id="fr_6623"></span>[6624](#fn_6623.md) of
their own, consecrated by a profound silence, having nothing of the
heavenly in them but their mystery. <span
id="fr_6624"></span>[6625](#fn_6624.md) By the help of the sacred names and
titles and arguments of true religion, they have fabricated the vainest
and foulest figment for men’s pliant liking, <span
id="fr_6625"></span>[6626](#fn_6625.md) out of the affluent suggestions of
Holy Scripture, since from its many springs many *errors* may well
emanate. If you propose to them inquiries sincere and honest, they
answer you with stern <span id="fr_6626"></span>[6627](#fn_6626.md) look
and contracted brow, and say, “The subject is profound.” If you try them
with subtle questions, with the ambiguities of their double tongue, they
affirm a community of faith (with yourself). If you intimate to <span
id="page_504">p. 504</span> <span id="v.vi.i-Page_504"></span>them that
you understand *their opinions*, they insist on knowing nothing
themselves. If you come to a close engagement with them they destroy
your own fond hope of a victory over them by a self-immolation. <span
id="fr_6627"></span>[6628](#fn_6627.md) Not even to their own disciples do
they commit a secret before they have made sure of them. They have the
knack of persuading men before instructing them; although truth
persuades by teaching, but does not teach by first persuading.
