<span id="vi.v.i-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.v.i-p7.1"></span>Blessed</span> Martyrs Designate,—Along with the
provision which our lady mother the Church from her bountiful breasts,
and each brother out of his private means, makes for your bodily wants
in the prison, accept also from me some contribution to your spiritual
sustenance; for it is not good that the flesh be feasted and the spirit
starve: nay, if that which is weak be carefully looked to, it is but
right that that which is still weaker should not be neglected. Not that
I am specially entitled to exhort you; yet not only the trainers and
overseers, but even the unskilled, nay, all who choose, without the
slightest need for it, are wont to animate from afar by their cries the
most accomplished gladiators, and from the mere throng of onlookers
useful suggestions have sometimes come; first, then, O blessed, grieve
not the Holy Spirit, <span id="fr_8961"></span>[8962](#fn_8961.md) who has
entered the prison with you; for if He had not gone with you there, you
would not have been there this day. Do you give all endeavour,
therefore, to retain Him; so let Him lead you thence to your Lord. The
prison, indeed, is the devil’s house as well, wherein he keeps his
family. But you have come within its walls for the very purpose of
trampling the wicked one under foot in his chosen abode. You had already
in pitched battle outside utterly overcome him; let him have no reason,
then, to say to himself, “They are now in my domain; with vile hatreds I
shall tempt them, with defections or dissensions among themselves.” Let
him fly from your presence, and skulk away into his own abysses,
shrunken and torpid, as though he were an outcharmed or smoked-out
snake. Give him not the success in his own kingdom of setting you at
variance with each other, but let him find you armed and fortified with
concord; for peace among you is battle with him. Some, not able to find
this peace in the Church, have been used to seek it from the imprisoned
martyrs. <span id="fr_8962"></span>[8963](#fn_8962.md) And so you ought to
have it dwelling with you, and to cherish it, and to guard it, that you
may be able perhaps to bestow it upon others.

\[Some differences had risen between these holy sufferers, as to the
personal merits of offenders who had appealed to them for their interest
in restoring them to communion.

<span id="vi.v.i-p9"></span> \[He favours this resource as sanctioned by
custom, and gently persuades them, by agreeing as to its propriety, to
bestow peace upon others.  But, the foresight of those who objected was
afterwards justified, for in Cyprian’s day this practice led to greater
evils, and he was obliged to discourage it (ep. xi.) in an epistle to
confessors.\]
