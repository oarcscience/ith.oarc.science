<span id="v.viii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Sundry Passages of St.
Paul, Which Speak of a Spiritual Resurrection, Compatible with the
Future Resurrection of the Body, Which is Even Assumed in Them.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxiii-p2"></span>The apostle indeed teaches, in his
Epistle to the Colossians, that we were once dead, alienated, and
enemies to the Lord in our minds, whilst we were living in wicked
works; <span id="fr_7429"></span>[7430](#fn_7429) that we were then
buried with Christ in baptism, and also raised again with Him through
the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the
dead. <span id="fr_7430"></span>[7431](#fn_7430) “And you, (adds he),
when ye were dead in sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath He
quickened together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses.” <span
id="fr_7431"></span>[7432](#fn_7431) And again:  “If ye are dead with
Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the
world, are ye subject to ordinances?” <span
id="fr_7432"></span>[7433](#fn_7432) Now, since he makes us spiritually
dead—in such a way, however, as to allow that we shall one day have to
undergo a bodily death,—so, considering indeed that we have been also
raised in a like spiritual sense, he equally allows that we shall
further have to undergo a bodily resurrection. In so many words <span
id="fr_7433"></span>[7434](#fn_7433) he says: “Since ye are risen with
Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the
right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on
the earth.” <span id="fr_7434"></span>[7435](#fn_7434) Accordingly, it
is in our mind that he shows that we rise (with Christ), since it is by
this alone that we are as yet able to reach to heavenly objects. These
we should not “seek,” nor “set our affection on,” if we had them already
in our possession. He also adds: “For ye are dead”—to your sins, he
means, not to yourselves—“and your life is hid with Christ in
God.” <span id="fr_7435"></span>[7436](#fn_7435) Now that life is not
yet apprehended which is hidden. In like manner John says: “And it doth
not yet ap<span id="page_562">p. 562</span> <span
id="v.viii.xxiii-Page_562"></span>pear what we shall be: we know,
however, that when He shall be manifest, we shall be like Him.” <span
id="fr_7436"></span>[7437](#fn_7436) We are far indeed from being
already what we know not of; we should, of course, be sure to know it if
we were already (like Him). It is therefore the contemplation of our
blessed hope even in this life by faith (that he speaks of)—not its
presence nor its possession, but only its expectation. Concerning this
expectation and hope Paul writes to the Galatians: “For we through the
Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.” <span
id="fr_7437"></span>[7438](#fn_7437) He says “we wait for it,” not we
are in possession of it. By the righteousness of God, he means that
judgment which we shall have to undergo as the recompense *of our
deeds*. It is in expectation of this for himself that the apostle writes
to the Philippians:  “If by any means,” says he, “I might attain to the
resurrection of the dead. Not as though I had already attained, or were
already perfect.” <span id="fr_7438"></span>[7439](#fn_7438) And yet he
had believed, and had known all mysteries, as an elect vessel and the
*great* teacher of the Gentiles; but for all that he goes on to say: “I,
however, follow on, if so be I may apprehend that for which I also am
apprehended of Christ.” <span id="fr_7439"></span>[7440](#fn_7439) Nay,
more:  “Brethren,” (he adds), “I count not myself to have apprehended:
but this one thing (I do), forgetting those things which are behind, and
reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the
mark for the prize of blamelessness, <span
id="fr_7440"></span>[7441](#fn_7440) whereby I may attain it;” meaning
the resurrection from the dead in its proper time. Even as he says to
the Galatians: “Let us not be weary in well-doing: for *in due season*
we shall reap.” <span id="fr_7441"></span>[7442](#fn_7441) Similarly,
concerning Onesiphorus, does he also write to Timothy: “The Lord grant
unto him that he may find mercy in that day;” <span
id="fr_7442"></span>[7443](#fn_7442) unto which day and time he charges
Timothy himself “to keep what had been committed to his care, without
spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ: which
in His times He shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the
King of kings and Lord of lords,” <span
id="fr_7443"></span>[7444](#fn_7443) speaking of (Him as) God. It is to
these same times that Peter in the Acts refers, when he says: “Repent ye
therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the
times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and He
shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the
heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which
God hath spoken by the mouth of His holy prophets.” <span
id="fr_7444"></span>[7445](#fn_7444)
