<span id="iv.iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Professions of Some Kinds Allied
to Idolatry. Of Astrology in Particular.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ix-p2"></span>We observe among the arts <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) also some professions liable to the
charge of idolatry. Of astrologers there should be no speaking
even; <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) but since one in these
days has challenged us, defending on his own behalf perseverance in that
profession, I will use a few words. I allege not that he honours idols,
whose names he has inscribed on the heaven, <span
id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) to whom he has attributed all God’s
power; because men, presuming that we are disposed of by the immutable
arbitrament of the stars, think on that account that God is not to be
sought after. One proposition I lay down: that those angels, the
deserters from God, the lovers of women, <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) were likewise the discoverers of this
curious art, on that account also condemned by God. Oh divine sentence,
reaching even unto the earth in its vigour, whereto the unwitting render
testimony! The astrologers are expelled just like their angels. The city
and Italy are interdicted to the astrologers, just as heaven to their
angels. <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) There is the same
penalty of exclusion for disciples and masters. “But Magi and
astrologers came from the east.” <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md)
We know the mutual alliance of magic and astrology. The interpreters of
the stars, then, were the first to announce Christ’s birth the first to
present Him “gifts.” By this bond, \[must\] I imagine, they put Christ
under obligation to themselves?  What then? Shall therefore the religion
of those Magi act as patron now also to astrologers? Astrology
now-a-days, forsooth, treats of Christ—is the science of the stars of
Christ; not of Saturn, or Mars, and whomsoever else out of the same
class of the dead <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) it pays
observance to and preaches? But, however, that science has been allowed
until the Gospel, in order that after Christ’s birth no one should
thence forward interpret any one’s nativity by the heaven. For they
therefore offered to the then infant Lord that frankincense and myrrh
and gold, to be, as it were, the close of worldly <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) sacrifice and glory, which Christ was
<span id="page_66">p. 66</span> <span id="iv.iv.ix-Page_66"></span>about
to do away. What, then?  The dream—sent, doubtless, of the will of
God—suggested to the same Magi, namely, that they should go home, but by
another way, not that by which they came. It means this: that they
should not walk in their ancient path. <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) Not that Herod should not pursue them,
who in fact did not pursue them; unwitting even that they had departed
*by another way*, since he was withal unwitting by what way they *came*.
Just so we ought to understand by it the right Way and Discipline. And
so the precept was rather, that thence forward they should *walk
otherwise*. So, too, that other species of magic which operates by
miracles, emulous even in opposition to Moses, <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) tried God’s patience until the
Gospel.  For thenceforward Simon Magus, just turned believer, (since he
was still thinking somewhat of his juggling sect; to wit, that among the
miracles of his profession he might buy even the gift of the Holy Spirit
through imposition of hands) was cursed by the apostles, and ejected
from the faith. <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) Both he and that
other magician, who was with Sergius Paulus, (since he began opposing
himself to the same apostles) was mulcted with loss of eyes. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) The same fate, I believe, would
astrologers, too, have met, if any had fallen in the way of the
apostles. But yet, when magic is punished, of which astrology is a
species, of course the species is condemned in the genus. After the
Gospel, you will nowhere find either sophists, Chaldeans, enchanters,
diviners, or magicians, except as clearly punished. “Where is the wise,
where the grammarian, where the disputer of this age? Hath not God made
foolish the wisdom of this age?” <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md)
You know nothing, astrologer, if you know not that you should be a
Christian. If you did know it, you ought to have known this also, that
you should have nothing more to do with that profession of yours which,
of itself, fore-chants the climacterics of others, and might instruct
you of its own danger. There is no part nor lot for you in that system
of yours. <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) He cannot hope for the
kingdom of the heavens, whose finger or wand abuses <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) the heaven.
