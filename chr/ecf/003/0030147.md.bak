<span id="iv.viii.i.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII. <span
id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md) —The Christians Defamed. A Sarcastic
Description of Fame; Its Deception and Atrocious Slanders of the
Christians Lengthily Described.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.vii-p3"></span>Whence comes it to pass, you will say
to us, that such a character could have been attributed to you, as to
have justified the lawmakers perhaps by its imputation? Let me ask on my
side, what voucher they had then, or you now, for the truth of the
imputation? (You answer,) Fame. Well, now, is not this—

<span id="iv.viii.i.vii-p4"></span>“Fama malum, quo non aliud velocius
ullum?” <span id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md)

<span id="iv.viii.i.vii-p8"></span>Now, why *a plague*, <span
id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md) if it be always true? It never ceases
from lying; nor even at the moment when it reports the truth is it so
free from the wish to lie, as not to interweave the false with the true,
by processes of addition, diminution, or confusion of various facts.
Indeed, <span id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md) such is its condition,
that it can only continue to exist while it lies. For it lives only just
so long as it fails to prove anything. As soon as it proves itself true,
it falls; and, as if its office of reporting news were at an end, it
quits its post: thenceforward the thing is held to be a fact, and it
passes under that name. No one, then, says, to take an instance, “The
report is that this happened at Rome,” or, “The rumour goes that he has
got a province;” but, “He has got a province,” and, “This happened at
Rome.” Nobody mentions a rumour except at an uncertainty, because nobody
can be sure of a rumour, but only of certain knowledge; and none but a
fool believes a rumour, because no wise man puts faith in an
uncertainty. In however wide a circuit <span
id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) a report has been circulated, it must
needs have originated some time or other from one mouth; afterwards it
creeps on somehow to ears and tongues which pass it on <span
id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) and so obscures the humble error in
which it began, that no one considers whether the mouth which first set
it a-going disseminated a falsehood,—a circumstance which often happens
either from a temper of rivalry, or a suspicious turn, or even the
pleasure of feigning news. It is, however, well that time reveals all
things, as your own sayings and proverbs testify; yea, as nature herself
attests, which has so ordered it that nothing lies hid, not even that
which fame has not reported. See, now, what a witness <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) you have suborned against us: it has
not been able up to this time to prove the report it set in motion,
although it has had so long a time to recommend it to our acceptance.
This name of ours took its rise in the reign of Augustus; under Tiberius
it was taught with all clearness and publicity; <span
id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md) under Nero it was ruthlessly
condemned, <span id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md) and you may weigh its
worth and character even from the person of its persecutor. If that
prince was a pious man, then the Christians are impious; if he was just,
if he was pure, then the Christians are unjust and impure; if he was not
a public enemy, we are enemies of our country: what sort of men we are,
our persecutor himself shows, since he of course punished what produced
hostility to himself. <span id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) Now,
although every other institution which existed under Nero has been
destroyed, yet this of ours has firmly remained—righteous, it would
seem, as being unlike the author (of its persecution). Two hundred and
fifty years, then, have not yet passed since our life began. During the
interval there have been so many criminals; so many crosses have
obtained immortality; <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) so many
infants have been slain; so many loaves steeped in blood; so many
extinctions of candles; <span id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md) so many
dissolute marriages. And up to the present time it is mere report which
fights against the Christians. No doubt it has a strong support in the
wickedness of the human mind, and utters its falsehoods with more
success among cruel and savage men. For the more inclined you are to
maliciousness, the more ready are you to believe evil; in short, men
more easily believe the evil that is false, than the good which is true.
Now, if injustice has left any place within you for the exercise of
prudence in investigating the truth of reports, justice of course
demanded <span id="page_115">p. 115</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.vii-Page_115"></span>that you should examine by whom the
report could have been spread among the multitude, and thus circulated
through the world. For it could not have been by the Christians
themselves, I suppose, since by the very constitution and law of all
mysteries the obligation of silence is imposed. How much more would this
be the case in such (mysteries as are ascribed to us), which, if
divulged, could not fail to bring down instant punishment from the
prompt resentment of men! Since, therefore, the Christians are not their
own betrayers, it follows that it must be strangers. Now I ask, how
could strangers obtain knowledge of us, when even true and lawful
mysteries exclude every stranger from witnessing them, unless illicit
ones are less exclusive? Well, then, it is more in keeping with the
character of strangers both to be ignorant (of the true state of a
case), and to invent (a false account). Our domestic servants (perhaps)
listened, and peeped through crevices and holes, and stealthily got
information of our ways.  What, then, shall we say when our servants
betray them to you? <span id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) It is
better, (to be sure,) <span id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) for us all
not to be betrayed by any; but still, if our practices be so atrocious,
how much more proper is it when a righteous indignation bursts asunder
even all ties of domestic fidelity?  How was it possible for it to
endure what horrified the mind and affrighted the eye? This is also a
wonderful thing, both that he who was so overcome with impatient
excitement as to turn informer, <span id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558.md)
did not likewise desire to prove (what he reported), and that he who
heard the informer’s story did not care to see for himself, since no
doubt the reward <span id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559.md) is equal both
for the informer who proves what he reports, and for the hearer who
convinces himself of the credibility <span
id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560.md) of what he hears. But then you say
that (this is precisely what has taken place):  first came the rumour,
then the exhibition of the proof; first the hearsay, then the
inspection; and after this, fame received its commission. Now this, I
must say, <span id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561.md) surpasses all
admiration, that that was once for all detected and divulged which is
being for ever repeated, unless, forsooth, we have by this time ceased
from the reiteration of such things <span
id="fr_562"></span>[563](#fn_562) (as are alleged of us.md). But we are
called still by the same (offensive) name, and we are supposed to be
still engaged in the same practices, and we multiply from day to day;
the more <span id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563.md) we are, to the more
become we objects of hatred. Hatred increases as the material for it
increases. Now, seeing that the multitude of offenders is ever
advancing, how is it that the crowd of informers does not keep equal
pace therewith? To the best of my belief, even our manner of life <span
id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564.md) has become better known; you know the
very days of our assemblies; therefore we are both besieged, and
attacked, and kept prisoners actually in our secret congregations. Yet
who ever came upon a half-consumed corpse (amongst us)? Who has detected
the traces of a bite in our blood-steeped loaf? Who has discovered, by a
sudden light invading our darkness, any marks of impurity, I will not
say of incest, (in our feasts)? If we save ourselves by a bribe <span
id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565.md) from being dragged out before the
public gaze with such a character, how is it that we are still
oppressed? We have it indeed in our own power not to be thus apprehended
at all; for who either sells or buys information about a crime, if the
crime itself has no existence? But why need I disparagingly refer
to <span id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566.md) strange spies and informers,
when you allege against us such charges as we certainly do not ourselves
divulge with very much noise—either as soon as you hear of them, if we
previously show them to you, or after you have yourselves discovered
them, if they are for the time concealed from you? For no doubt, <span
id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567.md) when any desire initiation in the
mysteries, their custom is first to go to the master or father of the
sacred rites.  Then he will say (to the applicant), You must bring an
infant, as a guarantee for our rites, to be sacrificed, as well as some
bread to be broken and dipped in his blood; you also want candles, and
dogs tied together to upset them, and bits of meat to rouse the dogs. 
Moreover, a mother too, or a sister, is necessary for you. What,
however, is to be said if you have neither? I suppose in that case you
could not be a genuine Christian. Now, do let me ask you, Will such
things, when reported by strangers, bear to be spread about (as charges
against us)? It is impossible for such persons to understand proceedings
in which they take no part. <span id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568.md) The
first step of the process is perpetrated with artifice; our feasts and
our marriages are invented and detailed <span
id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569.md) by ignorant persons, <span
id="page_116">p. 116</span> <span id="iv.viii.i.vii-Page_116"></span>who
had never before heard about Christian mysteries. And though they
afterwards cannot help acquiring some knowledge of them, it is even then
as having to be administered by others whom they bring on the
scene. <span id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570.md) Besides, how absurd is it
that the profane know mysteries which the priest knows not!  They keep
them all to themselves, then, <span id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571.md)
and take them for granted; and so these tragedies, (worse than those) of
Thyestes or Œdipus, do not at all come forth to light, nor find their
way <span id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572.md) to the public. Even more
voracious bites take nothing away from the credit <span
id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573.md) of such as are initiated, whether
servants or masters. If, however, none of these allegations can be
proved to be true, how incalculable must be esteemed the grandeur (of
that religion) which is manifestly not overbalanced even by the burden
of these vast atrocities! O ye heathen; who have and deserve our
pity, <span id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574.md) behold, we set before you
the promise which our sacred system offers. It guarantees eternal life
to such as follow and observe it; on the other hand, it threatens with
the eternal punishment of an unending fire those who are profane and
hostile; while to both classes alike is preached a resurrection from the
dead.  We are not now concerned <span id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575.md)
about the doctrine of these (verities), which are discussed in their
proper place. <span id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576.md) Meanwhile,
however, believe them, even as we do ourselves, for I want to know
whether you are ready to reach them, as we do, through such crimes.
Come, whosoever you are, plunge your sword into an infant; or if that is
another’s office, then simply gaze at the breathing creature <span
id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577.md) dying before it has lived; at any
rate, catch its fresh <span id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578.md) blood in
which to steep your bread; then feed yourself without stint; and whilst
this is going on, recline.  Carefully distinguish the places where your
mother or your sister may have made their bed; mark them well, in order
that, when the shades of night have fallen upon them, putting of course
to the test the care of every one of you, you may not make the awkward
mistake of alighting on somebody else: <span
id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579.md) you would have to make an atonement,
if you failed of the incest. When you have effected all this, eternal
life will be in store for you. I want you to tell me whether you think
eternal life worth such a price. No, indeed, <span
id="fr_580"></span>[581](#fn_580.md) you do not believe it: even if you did
believe it, I maintain that you would be unwilling to give (the fee); or
if willing, would be unable. But why should others be able if you are
unable? Why should you be able if others are unable?  What would you
wish impunity (and) eternity to stand you in? <span
id="fr_581"></span>[582](#fn_581) Do you suppose that these (blessings.md)
can be bought by us at any price? Have Christians teeth of a different
sort from others? Have they more ample jaws? <span
id="fr_582"></span>[583](#fn_582.md) Are they of different nerve for
incestuous lust? I trow not. It is enough for us to differ from you in
condition <span id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583.md) by truth alone.

context.  “At all events,” says he, “they know this afterward, and yet
submit to it, and allow it. *They fear to be punished*, while, if they
proclaimed the truth, they would deserve universal approbation.” 
Tertullian here states what the enemies of the Christians used to allege
against them. After discovering the alleged atrocities of their secret
assemblies, they kept their knowledge forsooth to themselves, being
afraid of the consequences of a disclosure, etc.
