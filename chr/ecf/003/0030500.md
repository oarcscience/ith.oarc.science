<span id="v.v.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—A Further Vindication of the
Scripture Narrative of the Creation, Against a Futile View of
Hermogenes.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxxi-p2"></span>But this circumstance, too, will be caught
at, that Scripture meant to indicate of the heaven only, and this earth
of yours, <span id="fr_6442"></span>[6443](#fn_6442) that God made it in
the beginning, while nothing of the kind *is said* of the
above-mentioned specific parts; <span
id="fr_6443"></span>[6444](#fn_6443) and therefore that these, which are
not described as having been made, appertain to unformed Matter. To this
point <span id="fr_6444"></span>[6445](#fn_6444) also we must give an
answer. Holy Scripture would be sufficiently explicit, if it had
declared that the heaven and the earth, as the very highest works of
creation, were made by God, possessing of course their own special
appurtenances, <span id="fr_6445"></span>[6446](#fn_6445) which might be
understood to be implied in these highest works themselves. Now the
appurtenances of the heaven and the earth, made then in the beginning,
were the darkness and the deep, and the spirit, and the waters. For the
depth and the darkness underlay the earth.  Since <span id="page_495">p.
495</span> <span id="v.v.xxxi-Page_495"></span>the deep was under the
earth, and the darkness was over the deep, undoubtedly both the darkness
and the deep were under the earth. Below the heaven, too, lay the
spirit <span id="fr_6446"></span>[6447](#fn_6446) and the waters. For
since the waters were over the earth, which they covered, whilst the
spirit was over the waters, both the spirit and the waters were alike
over the earth. Now that which is over the earth, is of course under the
heaven. And even as the earth brooded over the deep and the darkness, so
also did the heaven brood over the spirit and the waters, and embrace
them.  Nor, indeed, is there any novelty in mentioning only that which
contains, as pertaining to the whole, <span
id="fr_6447"></span>[6448](#fn_6447) and understanding that which is
contained as included in it, in its character of a portion. <span
id="fr_6448"></span>[6449](#fn_6448) Suppose now I should say the city
built a theatre and a circus, but the stage <span
id="fr_6449"></span>[6450](#fn_6449) was of such and such a kind, and
the statues were on the canal, and the obelisk was reared above them
all, would it follow that, because I did not distinctly state that these
specific things <span id="fr_6450"></span>[6451](#fn_6450) were made by
the city, they were therefore not made by it along with the circus and
the theatre? Did I not, indeed, refrain from specially mentioning the
formation of these particular things because they were implied in the
things which I had already said were made, and might be understood to be
inherent in the things in which they were contained? But this example
may be an idle one as being derived from a human circumstance; I will
take another, which has the authority of Scripture itself.  It says that
“God made man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life, and man became a living soul.” <span
id="fr_6451"></span>[6452](#fn_6451) Now, although it here mentions the
nostrils, <span id="fr_6452"></span>[6453](#fn_6452) it does not say
that they were made by God; so again it speaks of skin <span
id="fr_6453"></span>[6454](#fn_6453) and bones, and flesh and eyes, and
sweat and blood, in subsequent passages, <span
id="fr_6454"></span>[6455](#fn_6454) and yet it never intimated that
they had been created by God. What will Hermogenes have to answer? That
the human limbs must belong to Matter, because they are not specially
mentioned as objects of creation? Or are they included in the formation
of man? In like manner, the deep and the darkness, and the spirit and
the waters, were *as* members of the heaven and the earth. For in the
bodies the limbs were made, in the bodies the limbs too were mentioned.
No element but what is a member of that element in which it is
contained. But all elements are contained in the heaven and the earth.
