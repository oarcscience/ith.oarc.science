id="iv.xi.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIV.—Whither Does the Soul Retire
When It Quits the Body?  Opinions of Philosophers All More or Less
Absurd. The Hades of Plato.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.liv-p2"></span>To the question, therefore, whither the
soul is withdrawn, we now give an answer. Almost all the philosophers,
who hold the soul’s immortality, notwithstanding their special views on
the subject, still claim for it this (eternal condition), as Pythagoras,
and Empedocles, and Plato, and as they who indulge it with some delay
from the time of its quitting the flesh to the conflagration of all
things, and as the Stoics, who place only their own souls, that is, the
souls of the wise, in the mansions above. Plato, it is true, does not
allow this destination to all the souls, indiscriminately, of even all
the philosophers, but only of those who have cultivated their philosophy
out of love to boys. So great is the privilege which impurity obtains at
the hands of philosophers!  In his system, then, the souls of the wise
are carried up on high into the ether: according to Arius, <span
id="fr_1796"></span>[1797](#fn_1796) into the air; according to the
Stoics, into the moon. I wonder, indeed, that they abandon to the earth
the souls of the unwise, when they affirm that even these are instructed
by the wise, so much their superiors.  For where is the school where
they can have been instructed in the vast space which divides them? By
what means can the pupil-souls have resorted to their teachers, when
they are parted from each other by so distant an interval?  What <span
id="page_231">p. 231</span> <span id="iv.xi.liv-Page_231"></span>profit,
too, can any instruction afford them at all in their posthumous state,
when they are on the brink of perdition by the universal fire? All other
souls they thrust down to Hades, which Plato, in his *Phædo*, <span
id="fr_1797"></span>[1798](#fn_1797) describes as the bosom of the
earth, where all the filth of the world accumulates, settles, and
exhales, and where every separate draught of air only renders denser
still the impurities of the seething mass.
