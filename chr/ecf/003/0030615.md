<span id="v.viii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—So Much for the Prophetic
Scriptures.  In the Gospels, Christ’s Parables, as Explained by Himself,
Have a Clear Reference to the Resurrection of the Flesh.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxxiii-p2"></span>This is evidence enough from the
prophetic Scriptures. I now appeal to the Gospels. But here also I must
first meet the same sophistry as advanced by those who contend that the
Lord, like (the prophets), said everything in the way of allegory,
because it is written: “All these things spake Jesus in parables, and
without a parable spake He not unto them,” <span
id="fr_7495"></span>[7496](#fn_7495) that is, to the Jews. Now the
disciples also asked Him, “Why speakest Thou in parables?” <span
id="fr_7496"></span>[7497](#fn_7496) And the Lord gave them this answer:
“Therefore I speak unto them in parables: because they seeing, see not;
and hearing, they hear not, according to the prophecy of Esaias.” <span
id="fr_7497"></span>[7498](#fn_7497) But since it was to the Jews that
He spoke in parables, it was not then to all men; and if not to all, it
follows that it was not always and in all things parables with Him, but
only in certain things, and when addressing a particular class. But He
addressed a particular class when He spoke to the Jews. It is true that
He spoke sometimes even to the disciples in parables. But observe how
the Scripture relates such a fact:  “And He spake a parable unto
them.” <span id="fr_7498"></span>[7499](#fn_7498) It follows, then, that
He did not usually address them in parables; because if He always did
so, special mention would not be made of His resorting to this mode of
address. Besides, there is not a parable which you will not find to be
either explained by the Lord Himself, as that of the sower, (which He
interprets) of the management of the word of God; <span
id="fr_7499"></span>[7500](#fn_7499) or else cleared by a preface from
the writer of the Gospel, as in the parable of the arrogant judge and
the importunate widow, *which is expressly applied* to earnestness in
prayer; <span id="fr_7500"></span>[7501](#fn_7500) or capable of being
spontaneously understood, <span id="fr_7501"></span>[7502](#fn_7501) as
in the parable of the fig-tree, which was spared a while in hopes of
improvement—an emblem of Jewish sterility.  Now, <span id="page_569">p.
569</span> <span id="v.viii.xxxiii-Page_569"></span>if even parables
obscure not the light of the gospel, how unlikely it is that plain
sentences and declarations, which have an unmistakeable meaning, should
signify any other thing than their literal sense! But it is by such
declarations and sentences that the Lord sets forth either the last
judgment, or the kingdom, or the resurrection: “It shall be more
tolerable,” He says, “for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment *than
for you*.” <span id="fr_7502"></span>[7503](#fn_7502) And “Tell them
that the kingdom of God is at hand.” <span
id="fr_7503"></span>[7504](#fn_7503) And again, “It shall be recompensed
to you at the resurrection of the just.” <span
id="fr_7504"></span>[7505](#fn_7504) Now, if the mention of these events
(I mean the judgment-day, and the kingdom of God, and the resurrection)
has a plain and absolute sense, so that nothing about them can be
pressed into an allegory, neither should those statements be forced into
parables which describe the arrangement, and the process, and the
experience of the kingdom *of God*, and of the judgment, and of the
resurrection. On the contrary, things which are destined for the body
should be carefully understood in a bodily sense,—not in a spiritual
sense, as having nothing figurative in their nature. This is the reason
why we have laid it down as a preliminary consideration, that the bodily
substance both of the soul and of the flesh is liable to the recompense,
which will have to be awarded in return for the co-operation of the two
natures, that so the corporeality of the soul may not exclude the bodily
nature of the flesh by suggesting a recourse to figurative descriptions,
since both of them must needs be regarded as destined to take part in
the kingdom, and the judgment, and the resurrection. And now we proceed
to the special proof of this proposition, that the bodily character of
the flesh is indicated by our Lord whenever He mentions the
resurrection, at the same time without disparagement to the corporeal
nature of the soul,—a point which has been actually admitted but by a
few.
