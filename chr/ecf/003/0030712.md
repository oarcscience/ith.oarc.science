<span id="vi.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Repentance Applicable to All the
Kinds of Sin. To Be Practised Not Only, Nor Chiefly, for the Good It
Brings, But Because God Commands It.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p2"></span>To all sins, then, committed whether by
flesh or spirit, whether by deed or will, the same *God* who has
destined penalty by means of judgment, has withal engaged to grant
pardon by means of repentance, saying to the people, “Repent thee, and I
will save thee;” <span id="fr_8439"></span>[8440](#fn_8439.md) and again,
“I live, saith the Lord, and I will (have) repentance rather than
death.” <span id="fr_8440"></span>[8441](#fn_8440.md) Repentance, then, is
“life,” since it is preferred to “death.” That repentance, O sinner,
like myself (nay, rather, less than myself, for pre-eminence in sins I
acknowledge to be mine <span id="fr_8441"></span>[8442](#fn_8441) .md), do
you so hasten to, so embrace, as a shipwrecked man the protection <span
id="fr_8442"></span>[8443](#fn_8442.md) of some plank. This will draw you
forth when sunk in the waves of sins, and will bear you forward into the
port of the divine clemency. Seize the opportunity of unexpected
felicity: that you, who sometime were in God’s sight nothing but “a drop
of a bucket,” <span id="fr_8443"></span>[8444](#fn_8443.md) and “dust of
the threshing-floor,” <span id="fr_8444"></span>[8445](#fn_8444.md) and “a
potter’s vessel,” <span id="fr_8445"></span>[8446](#fn_8445.md) may
thenceforward become that “tree which is sown beside <span
id="fr_8446"></span>[8447](#fn_8446.md) the waters, is perennial in leaves,
bears fruit at its own time,” <span id="fr_8447"></span>[8448](#fn_8447.md)
and shall not see “fire,” <span id="fr_8448"></span>[8449](#fn_8448.md) nor
“axe.” <span id="fr_8449"></span>[8450](#fn_8449.md) Having found “the
truth,” <span id="fr_8450"></span>[8451](#fn_8450.md) repent of errors;
repent of having loved what God loves not: even we ourselves do not
permit our slave-lads not to hate the things which <span
id="page_660">p. 660</span> <span id="vi.ii.iv-Page_660"></span>are
offensive to us; for the principle of voluntary obedience <span
id="fr_8451"></span>[8452](#fn_8451.md) consists in similarity of minds.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p16"></span>To reckon up the good, of repentance, the
subject-matter is copious, and therefore should be committed to great
eloquence. Let us, however, in proportion to our narrow abilities,
inculcate one point,—that what God enjoins is good and best. I hold it
audacity to dispute about the “good” of a divine precept; for, indeed,
it is not the fact that it is good which binds us to obey, but the fact
that God has enjoined it. To exact the rendering of obedience the
majesty of divine power has the prior <span
id="fr_8452"></span>[8453](#fn_8452.md) right; the authority of Him who
commands is prior to the utility of him who serves. “Is it good to
repent, or no?” Why do you ponder? God enjoins; nay, He not merely
enjoins, but likewise exhorts. He invites by (offering)
reward—salvation, to wit; even by an oath, saying “I live,” <span
id="fr_8453"></span>[8454](#fn_8453.md) He desires that credence may be
given Him.  Oh blessed we, for whose sake God swears! Oh most miserable,
if we believe not the Lord even when He swears! What, therefore, God so
highly commends, what He even (after human fashion) attests on oath, we
are bound of course to approach, and to guard with the utmost
seriousness; that, abiding permanently in (the faith of) the solemn
pledge <span id="fr_8454"></span>[8455](#fn_8454.md) of divine grace, we
may be able also to persevere in like manner in its fruit <span
id="fr_8455"></span>[8456](#fn_8455.md) and its benefit.
