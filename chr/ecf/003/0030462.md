<span id="v.iv.vi.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—The Second Epistle to the
Thessalonians. An Absurd Erasure of Marcion; Its Object Transparent. The
Final Judgment on the Heathen as Well as the Jews Could Not Be
Administered by Marcion’s Christ. The Man of Sin—What? Inconsistency of
Marcion’s View. The Antichrist. The Great Events of the Last Apostasy
Within the Providence and Intention of the Creator, Whose are All Things
from the Beginning. Similarity of the Pauline Precepts with Those of the
Creator.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.xvi-p2"></span>We are obliged from time to time to
recur to certain topics in order to affirm *truths* which are connected
with them. We repeat then here, that as the Lord is by the apostle
proclaimed <span id="fr_5919"></span>[5920](#fn_5919) as the awarder of
both weal and woe, <span id="fr_5920"></span>[5921](#fn_5920) He must be
either the Creator, or (as Marcion would be loth to admit) One like the
Creator—“with whom it is a righteous thing to recompense tribulation to
them who afflict us, and to ourselves, who are afflicted, rest, when the
Lord Jesus shall be revealed as coming from heaven with the angels of
His might and in flaming fire.” <span
id="fr_5921"></span>[5922](#fn_5921) The heretic, however, has erased
*the flaming fire*, no doubt that he might extinguish all traces herein
of our own God.  But the folly of the obliteration is clearly seen. For
as the apostle declares that the Lord will come “to take vengeance on
them that know not God and that obey not the gospel, who,” he says,
“shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the
Lord, and from the glory of His power” <span
id="fr_5922"></span>[5923](#fn_5922) —it follows that, as He comes to
inflict punishment, He must require “the flaming fire.” Thus on this
consideration too we must, notwithstanding Marcion’s opposition,
conclude that Christ belongs to a God who kindles the flames <span
id="fr_5923"></span>[5924](#fn_5923) (of vengeance), and therefore to
the Creator, inasmuch as He takes vengeance on such as know not the
Lord, that is, on the heathen. For he has mentioned separately “those
who obey not the gospel *of our Lord Jesus Christ*,” <span
id="fr_5924"></span>[5925](#fn_5924) whether they be sinners among
Christians or among Jews. Now, to inflict punishment on the heathen, who
very likely have never heard of the Gospel, is not the function of that
God who is naturally unknown, and who is revealed nowhere else than in
the Gospel, and therefore cannot be known by all men. <span
id="fr_5925"></span>[5926](#fn_5925) The Creator, however, ought to be
known even by (the light of) nature, for He may be understood from His
works, and may thereby become the object of a more widely spread
knowledge. To *Him*, therefore, does it appertain to punish such as know
not God, for none ought to be ignorant of Him. In the (apostle’s)
phrase, “From the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His
power,” <span id="fr_5926"></span>[5927](#fn_5926) he uses the words of
Isaiah who for the express reason makes the self-same Lord “arise to
shake terribly the earth.” <span id="fr_5927"></span>[5928](#fn_5927)
Well, but who is the man of sin, the son of perdition,” who must first
be revealed before the Lord comes; “who opposeth and exalteth <span
id="page_464">p. 464</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xvi-Page_464"></span>himself above all that is called God,
or that is worshipped; who is to sit in the temple of God, and boast
himself as being God?” <span id="fr_5928"></span>[5929](#fn_5928)
According indeed to our view, he is Antichrist; as it is taught us in
both the ancient and the new prophecies, <span
id="fr_5929"></span>[5930](#fn_5929) and *especially* by the Apostle
John, who says that “already many false prophets are gone out into the
world,” the fore-runners of Antichrist, who deny that Christ is come in
the flesh, <span id="fr_5930"></span>[5931](#fn_5930) and do not
acknowledge <span id="fr_5931"></span>[5932](#fn_5931) Jesus (to be the
Christ), meaning in God the Creator. According, however, to Marcion’s
view, it is really hard to know whether He might not be (after all) the
Creator’s Christ; because according to him *He* is not yet come. But
whichsoever of the two it is, I want to know why he comes “in all power,
and with lying signs and wonders?” <span
id="fr_5932"></span>[5933](#fn_5932) “Because,” he says, “they received
not the love of the truth, that they might be saved; for which cause God
shall send them an instinct of delusion <span
id="fr_5933"></span>[5934](#fn_5933) (to believe a lie), that they all
might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in
unrighteousness.” <span id="fr_5934"></span>[5935](#fn_5934) If
therefore he be Antichrist, (as we hold), and *comes* according to the
Creator’s purpose, it must be God the Creator who sends him to fasten in
their error those who did not believe the truth, that they might be
saved; *His* likewise must be the truth and the salvation, who avenges
(the contempt of) them by sending error as their substitute <span
id="fr_5935"></span>[5936](#fn_5935) —that is, the Creator, to whom that
very wrath is a fitting attribute, which deceives with a lie those who
are not captivated with truth. If, however, he is not Antichrist, as we
suppose (him to be) then He is the Christ of the Creator, as Marcion
will have it. In this case how happens it that he <span
id="fr_5936"></span>[5937](#fn_5936) can suborn the Creator’s Christ to
avenge his truth? But should he after all agree with us, that Antichrist
is here meant, I must then likewise ask how it is that he finds Satan,
an angel of the Creator, necessary to his purpose? Why, too, should
*Antichrist* be slain by Him, whilst commissioned by the Creator to
execute the function <span id="fr_5937"></span>[5938](#fn_5937) of
inspiring men with their love of untruth?  In short, it is incontestable
that the emissary, <span id="fr_5938"></span>[5939](#fn_5938) and the
truth, and the salvation belong to Him to whom also appertain the wrath,
and the jealousy, <span id="fr_5939"></span>[5940](#fn_5939) and “the
sending of the strong delusion,” <span
id="fr_5940"></span>[5941](#fn_5940) on those who despise and mock, as
well as upon those who are ignorant of Him; and therefore even Marcion
will now have to come down a step, and concede to us that his god is “a
jealous god.” (This being then an unquestionable position, I ask) which
God has the greater right to be angry? He, as I suppose, who from the
beginning of all things has given to man, as primary witnesses for the
knowledge of Himself, nature in her (manifold) works, kindly
providences, plagues, <span id="fr_5941"></span>[5942](#fn_5941) and
indications (of His divinity), <span
id="fr_5942"></span>[5943](#fn_5942) but who in spite of all this
evidence has not been acknowledged; or he who has been brought out to
view <span id="fr_5943"></span>[5944](#fn_5943) once for all in one only
copy of the gospel—and even that without any sure authority—which
actually makes no secret of proclaiming another god? Now He who has the
right of inflicting the vengeance, has also sole claim to that which
occasions <span id="fr_5944"></span>[5945](#fn_5944) the vengeance, I
mean the Gospel; (in other words,) both the truth and (its accompanying)
salvation. The charge, that “if any would not work, neither should he
eat,” <span id="fr_5945"></span>[5946](#fn_5945) is in strict accordance
with the precept of Him who ordered that “the mouth of the ox that
treadeth out the corn should not be muzzled.” <span
id="fr_5946"></span>[5947](#fn_5946)

receives some explanation from the Vulgate version of [1 John iv.
3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003)<span id="v.iv.vi.xvi-p15.1"></span>:
“Et omnis spiritus qui *solvit* Jesum Christum ex Deo non est.” From
Irenæus, Vol. I., 443 (Harvey, ii. 89), we learn that the Gnostics
*divided* Jesus from Christ: “Alterum quidem Jesum intelligunt, alterum
autem Christum,”—an error which was met in the clause of the creed
expressing faith in “*One Lord Jesus Christ*.” Grabe, after Socrates,
*Hist. Eccles.* vii. 32, says that the oldest <span class="sc"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xvi-p15.3"></span>mss.</span> of St. John’s epistle read
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.vi.xvi-p15.4"></span>πᾶν πνεῦμα ὅ
λύει τὸν ᾽Ιησοῦν</span>. If so, Tertullian must be regarded as combining
the two readings, viz., that which we find in the received text and this
just quoted. Thus Grabe. It would be better to say that T. read [John
4.2](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#002)<span
id="v.iv.vi.xvi-p15.5"></span> as we have it, only omitting <span
