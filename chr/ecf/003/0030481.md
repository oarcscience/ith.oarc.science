<span id="v.v.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The Mode of Controversy Changed.
The Premisses of Hermogenes Accepted, in Order to Show into What
Confusion They Lead Him.</span>

<span id="v.v.xii-p2"></span>Come now, let us suppose Matter to be evil,
nay, very evil, by *nature* of course, just as <span id="page_484">p.
484</span> <span id="v.v.xii-Page_484"></span>we believe God to be good,
even very good, in like manner by *nature*. Now nature must be regarded
as sure and fixed, just as persistently fixed in evil in the case of
Matter, as immoveable and unchangeable in good in the case of God. 
Because, as is evident, <span id="fr_6246"></span>[6247](#fn_6246) if
nature admits of change from evil to good in Matter, it can be changed
from good to evil in God. Here some man will say, Then will “children
not be raised up to Abraham from the stones?” <span
id="fr_6247"></span>[6248](#fn_6247) Will “generations of vipers not
bring forth the fruit of repentance?” <span
id="fr_6248"></span>[6249](#fn_6248) And “children of wrath” fail to
become sons of peace, if nature be unchangeable?  Your reference to such
examples as these, my friend, <span id="fr_6249"></span>[6250](#fn_6249)
is a thoughtless <span id="fr_6250"></span>[6251](#fn_6250) one. For
things which owe their existence to birth such as stones and vipers and
human beings—are not apposite to the case of Matter, which is unborn;
since their nature, by possessing a beginning, may have also a
termination.  But bear in mind <span
id="fr_6251"></span>[6252](#fn_6251) that Matter has once for all been
determined to be eternal, as being unmade, unborn, and therefore
supposably of an unchangeable and incorruptible nature; and this from
the very opinion of Hermogenes himself, which he alleges against us when
he denies that God was able to make (anything) of Himself, on the ground
that what is eternal is incapable of change, because it would lose—so
the opinion runs <span id="fr_6252"></span>[6253](#fn_6252) —what it
once was, in becoming by the change that which it was not, if it were
not eternal. But as for the Lord, who is also eternal, (he maintained)
that He could not be anything else than what He always is. Well, then, I
will adopt this definite opinion of his, and by means thereof refute
him. I blame Matter with a like censure, because out of it, evil though
it be—nay, very evil—good things have been created, nay, “very good”
ones: “And God saw that they were good, and God blessed them” <span
id="fr_6253"></span>[6254](#fn_6253) —because, of course, of their very
great goodness; certainly not because they were evil, or very evil.
Change is therefore admissible in Matter; and this being the case, it
has lost its condition of eternity; in short, <span
id="fr_6254"></span>[6255](#fn_6254) its beauty is decayed in
death. <span id="fr_6255"></span>[6256](#fn_6255) Eternity, however,
cannot be lost, because it cannot be eternity, except by reason of its
immunity from loss. For the same reason also it is incapable of change,
inasmuch as, since it is eternity, it can by no means be changed.
