<span id="iv.iii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxii-p2"></span>And we affirm indeed the existence of
certain spiritual essences; nor is their name unfamiliar. The
philosophers acknowledge there are demons; Socrates himself waiting on a
demon’s will. Why not? since it is said an evil spirit attached itself
specially to him even from his childhood—turning his mind no doubt from
what was good. The poets are all acquainted with demons too; even the
ignorant common people make frequent use of them in cursing. In fact,
they call upon Satan, the demon-chief, in their execrations, as though
from some instinctive soul-knowledge of him. Plato also admits the
existence of angels. The dealers in magic, no less, come forward as
witnesses to the existence of both kinds of spirits. We are instructed,
moreover, by our sacred books how from certain angels, who fell of their
own free-will, there sprang a more wicked demon-brood, condemned of God
along with the authors of their race, and that chief we have referred
to. It will for the present be enough, however, that some account is
given of their work.  Their great business is the ruin of mankind. So,
from the very first, spiritual wickedness sought our destruction. They
inflict, accordingly, upon our bodies diseases and other grievous
calamities, while by violent assaults they hurry the soul into sudden
and extraordinary excesses. Their marvellous subtleness and tenuity give
them access to both parts of our nature. As spiritual, they can do no
harm; for, invisible and intangible, we are not cognizant of their
action save by its effects, as when some inexplicable, unseen poison in
the breeze blights the apples and the grain while in the flower, or
kills them in the bud, or destroys them when they have reached maturity;
as though by the tainted atmosphere in some unknown way spreading abroad
its pestilential exhalations. So, too, by an influence equally obscure,
demons and angels breathe into the soul, and rouse up its corruptions
with furious passions and vile excesses; or with cruel lusts accompanied
by various errors, of which the worst is that by which these deities are
commended to the favour of deceived and deluded human beings, that they
may get their proper food of flesh-fumes and blood when that is offered
up to idol-images. What is daintier food to the spirit of evil, than
turning men’s minds away from the true God by the illusions of a false
divination? And here I explain how these illusions are managed. Every
spirit is possessed of wings. This is a common property of both angels
and demons. So they are everywhere in a single moment; the whole world
is as one place to them; all that is done over the whole extent of it,
it is as easy for them to know as to report. Their swiftness of motion
is taken for divinity, because their nature is unknown. Thus they would
have themselves thought <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xxii-Page_37"></span>sometimes the authors of the things
which they announce; and sometimes, no doubt, the bad things are their
doing, never the good. The purposes of God, too, they took up of old
from the lips of the prophets, even as they spoke them; and they gather
them still from their works, when they hear them read aloud. Thus
getting, too, from this source some intimations of the future, they set
themselves up as rivals of the true God, while they steal His
divinations.  But the skill with which their responses are shaped to
meet events, your Crœsi and Pyrrhi know too well. On the other hand, it
was in that way we have explained, the Pythian was able to declare that
they were cooking a tortoise <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)
with the flesh of a lamb; in a moment he had been to Lydia. From
dwelling in the air, and their nearness to the stars, and their commerce
with the clouds, they have means of knowing the preparatory processes
going on in these upper regions, and thus can give promise of the rains
which they already feel.  Very kind too, no doubt, they are in regard to
the healing of diseases. For, first of all, they make you ill; then, to
get a miracle out of it, they command the application of remedies either
altogether new, or contrary to those in use, and straightway withdrawing
hurtful influence, they are supposed to have wrought a cure. What need,
then, to speak of their other artifices, or yet further of the deceptive
power which they have as spirits: of these Castor apparitions, <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) of water carried by a sieve, and a
ship drawn along by a girdle, and a beard reddened by a touch, all done
with the one object of showing that men should believe in the deity of
stones, and not seek after the only true God?
