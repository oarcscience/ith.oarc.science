<span id="v.iv.ii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—This Perverse Doctrine
Deprives Baptism of All Its Grace. If Marcion Be Right, the Sacrament
Would Confer No Remission of Sins, No Regeneration, No Gift of the
Spirit.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xxviii-p2"></span>And what will happen to him after he
is cast away? He will, they say, be thrown into the Creator’s fire. 
Then has no remedial provision been made (by their god) for the purpose
of banishing those that sin against him, without resorting to the cruel
measure of delivering them over to the Creator?  And what will the
Creator then do?  I suppose He will prepare for them a hell doubly
charged with brimstone, <span id="fr_2665"></span>[2666](#fn_2665.md) as
for blasphemers against Himself; except indeed their god in his zeal, as
perhaps might happen, should show clemency to his rival’s revolted
subjects. Oh, what a god is this! everywhere perverse; nowhere rational;
in all cases vain; and therefore a nonentity! <span
id="fr_2666"></span>[2667](#fn_2666.md) —in whose state, and condition, and
nature, and every appointment, I see no coherence and consistency; no,
not even in the very sacrament of his faith! For what end does baptism
serve, according to him? If the remission of sins, how will he make it
evident that he remits sins, when he affords no evidence that he retains
them? Because he would retain them, if he performed the functions of a
judge. If deliverance from death, how could he deliver *from* death, who
has not delivered *to* death? For he must have delivered the sinner to
death, if he had from the beginning condemned sin. If the regeneration
of man, how can he regenerate, who has never generated? For the
repetition of an act is impossible to him, by whom nothing any time has
been ever done. If the bestowal of the Holy Ghost, how will he bestow
the Spirit, who did not at first impart the life? For the life is in a
sense the supplement <span id="fr_2667"></span>[2668](#fn_2667.md) of the
Spirit. He therefore seals man, who had never been unsealed <span
id="fr_2668"></span>[2669](#fn_2668.md) in respect of him; <span
id="fr_2669"></span>[2670](#fn_2669.md) washes man, who had never been
defiled so far as he was concerned; <span
id="fr_2670"></span>[2671](#fn_2670.md) and into this sacrament of
salvation wholly plunges that flesh which is beyond the pale of
salvation! <span id="fr_2671"></span>[2672](#fn_2671.md) No farmer will
irrigate ground that will yield him no fruit in return, except he be as
stupid as Marcion’s god. Why then impose sanctity upon our most infirm
and most unworthy flesh, either as a burden or as a glory? What shall I
say, too, of the uselessness of a discipline which sanctifies what is
already sanctified? Why burden the infirm, or glorify the unworthy? Why
not remunerate with salvation what it burdens or else glorifies?  Why
keep back from a work its due reward, by not recompensing the flesh with
salvation? Why even permit the honour of sanctity in it to die?

to his love of antithesis, and makes almost nonsense of *signo* and
*resigno*. The latter verb has the meaning *violate* (in opposition to
*signo*, in the phrase *virgo signata*, a pure unviolated virgin).
