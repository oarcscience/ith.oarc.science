<span id="v.vi.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—These Heretics Brand the Christians
as Simple Persons.  The Charge Accepted, and Simplicity Eulogized Out of
the Scriptures.</span>

<span id="v.vi.ii-p2"></span>For this reason we are branded <span
id="fr_6628"></span>[6629](#fn_6628.md) by them as simple, and as being
merely so, without being wise also; as if indeed wisdom were compelled
to be wanting in simplicity, whereas the Lord unites them both: “Be ye
therefore wise as serpents, and simple as doves.” <span
id="fr_6629"></span>[6630](#fn_6629.md) Now if we, on our parts, be
accounted foolish because we are simple, does it then follow that they
are not simple because they are wise? Most perverse, however, are they
who are not simple, even as they are most foolish who are not wise. And
yet, (if I must choose) I should prefer taking <span
id="fr_6630"></span>[6631](#fn_6630.md) the *latter* condition for the
lesser fault; since it is perhaps better to have a wisdom which falls
short in quantity, than that which is bad in quality <span
id="fr_6631"></span>[6632](#fn_6631.md) —better to be in error than to
mislead. Besides, the face of the Lord <span
id="fr_6632"></span>[6633](#fn_6632.md) is patiently waited for by those
who “seek Him in simplicity of heart,” as says the very Wisdom—not of
Valentinus, but—of Solomon. <span id="fr_6633"></span>[6634](#fn_6633.md)
Then, again, infants have borne <span
id="fr_6634"></span>[6635](#fn_6634.md) by their blood a testimony to
Christ.  (Would you say) that it was children who shouted “Crucify
Him”? <span id="fr_6635"></span>[6636](#fn_6635.md) They were neither
children nor infants; in other words, they were not simple. The apostle,
too, bids us to “become children again” towards God, <span
id="fr_6636"></span>[6637](#fn_6636.md) “to be as children in malice” by
our simplicity, yet as being also “wise in our practical
faculties.” <span id="fr_6637"></span>[6638](#fn_6637.md) At the same time,
with respect to the order of development in Wisdom, I have
admitted <span id="fr_6638"></span>[6639](#fn_6638.md) that it flows from
simplicity. In brief, “the dove” has usually served to figure Christ;
“the serpent,” to tempt Him. The one even from the first has been the
harbinger of divine peace; the other from the beginning has been the
despoiler of the divine image.  Accordingly, simplicity alone <span
id="fr_6639"></span>[6640](#fn_6639.md) will be more easily able to know
and to declare God, *whereas* wisdom alone will rather do Him
violence, <span id="fr_6640"></span>[6641](#fn_6640.md) and betray Him.
