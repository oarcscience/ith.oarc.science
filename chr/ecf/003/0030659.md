<span id="v.ix.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Other Quotations from Holy
Scripture Adduced in Proof of the Plurality of Persons in the
Godhead.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xii-p2"></span>If the number of the Trinity also offends
you, as if it were not connected in the simple Unity, I ask you how it
is possible for a Being who is merely and absolutely One and Singular,
to speak in plural phrase, saying, “Let us make man in our own image,
and after our own likeness;” <span id="fr_7893"></span>[7894](#fn_7893.md)
whereas He ought to have said, “Let me make man in my own image, and
after my own likeness,” as being a unique and singular Being? In the
following passage, however, “Behold the man is become as one of
us,” <span id="fr_7894"></span>[7895](#fn_7894.md) He is either deceiving
or amusing us in speaking plurally, if He is One only and singular. Or
was it to the angels that He spoke, as the Jews interpret the passage,
because these also acknowledge not the Son? Or was it because He was at
once the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, that He spoke to Himself in
plural terms, making Himself plural on that very account? Nay, it was
because He had already His Son close at His side, as a second Person,
His own Word, and a third Person also, the Spirit in the Word, that He
purposely adopted the plural phrase, “Let *us* make;” and, “in *our*
image;” and, “become as one *of us*.” For with whom did He make man? and
to whom did He make him like? (The answer must be), the Son on <span
id="page_607">p. 607</span> <span id="v.ix.xii-Page_607"></span>the one
hand, who was one day to put on human nature; and the Spirit on the
other, who was to sanctify man. With these did He then speak, in the
Unity of the Trinity, as with His ministers and witnesses. In the
following text also He distinguishes among the Persons: “So God created
man in His own image; in the image of God created He him.” <span
id="fr_7895"></span>[7896](#fn_7895.md) Why say “image of God?” Why not
“His own image” merely, if He was only one who was the Maker, and if
there was not also One in whose image He made man? But there was One in
whose image God was making man, that is to say, Christ’s image, who,
being one day about to become Man (more surely and more truly so), had
already caused the man to be called His image, who was then going to be
formed of clay—the image and similitude of the true and perfect Man. 
But in respect of the previous works of the world what says the
Scripture? Its first statement indeed is made, when the Son has not yet
appeared:  “And God said, Let there be light, and there was
light.” <span id="fr_7896"></span>[7897](#fn_7896.md) Immediately there
appears the Word, “that true light, which lighteth man on his coming
into the world,” <span id="fr_7897"></span>[7898](#fn_7897.md) and through
Him also came light upon the world. <span
id="fr_7898"></span>[7899](#fn_7898.md) From that moment God willed
creation to be effected in the Word, Christ being present and
ministering unto Him: and so God created. And God said, “Let there be a
firmament,…and God made the firmament;” <span
id="fr_7899"></span>[7900](#fn_7899.md) and God also said, “Let there be
lights (in the firmament); and *so* God made a greater and a lesser
light.” <span id="fr_7900"></span>[7901](#fn_7900.md) But all the rest of
the created things did He in like manner make, who made the former
ones—I mean the Word of God, “through whom all things were made, and
without whom nothing was made.” <span
id="fr_7901"></span>[7902](#fn_7901.md) Now if He too is God, according to
John, (who says,) “The Word was God,” <span
id="fr_7902"></span>[7903](#fn_7902.md) then you have two Beings—One that
commands that the thing be made, and the Other that *executes the order
and* creates. In what sense, however, you ought to understand Him to be
another, I have already explained, on the ground of Personality, not of
Substance—in the way of distinction, not of division. <span
id="fr_7903"></span>[7904](#fn_7903.md) But although I must everywhere hold
one only substance in three coherent and inseparable (Persons), yet I am
bound to acknowledge, from the necessity of the case, that He who issues
a command is different from Him who executes it. For, indeed, He would
not be issuing a command if He were all the while doing the work
Himself, while ordering it to be done by the second. <span
id="fr_7904"></span>[7905](#fn_7904.md) But still He did issue the command,
although He would not have intended to command Himself if He were only
one; or else He must have worked without any command, because He would
not have waited to command Himself.
