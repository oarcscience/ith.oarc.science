<span id="v.ix.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Unity of the Godhead and the
Supremacy and Sole Government of the Divine Being. The Monarchy Not at
All Impaired by the Catholic Doctrine.</span>

<span id="v.ix.iv-p2"></span>But as for me, who derive the Son from no
other source but from the substance of the Father, and (represent Him)
as doing nothing without the Father’s will, and as having received all
power from the Father, how can I be possibly destroying the Monarchy
from the faith, when I preserve it in the Son just as it was committed
to Him by the Father? The same remark (I wish also to be formally) made
by me with respect to the third degree *in the Godhead*, because I
believe the Spirit *to proceed* from no other source than from the
Father through the Son. <span id="fr_7797"></span>[7798](#fn_7797.md) Look
to it then, that it be not *you* rather who are destroying the Monarchy,
when you overthrow the arrangement and dispensa<span id="page_600">p.
600</span> <span id="v.ix.iv-Page_600"></span>tion of it, which has been
constituted in just as many names as it has pleased God *to employ*. But
it remains so firm and stable in its own state, notwithstanding the
introduction into it of the Trinity, that the Son actually has to
restore it entire to the Father; even as the apostle says in his
epistle, concerning the very end of all: “When He shall have delivered
up the kingdom to God, even the Father; for He must reign till He hath
put all enemies under His feet;” <span
id="fr_7798"></span>[7799](#fn_7798.md) following of course the words of
the Psalm:  “Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy
footstool.” <span id="fr_7799"></span>[7800](#fn_7799.md) “When, however,
all things shall be subdued to Him, (with the exception of Him who did
put all things under Him,) then shall the Son also Himself be subject
unto Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in
all.” <span id="fr_7800"></span>[7801](#fn_7800.md) We thus see that the
Son is no obstacle to the Monarchy, although it is now administered
by <span id="fr_7801"></span>[7802](#fn_7801.md) the Son; because with the
Son it is still in its own state, and with its own state will be
restored to the Father by the Son. No one, therefore, will impair it, on
account of admitting the Son (to it), since it is certain that it has
been committed to Him by the Father, and by and by has to be again
delivered up by Him to the Father. Now, from this one passage of the
epistle of the *inspired* apostle, we have been already able to show
that the Father and the Son are two *separate Persons*, not only by the
mention of their separate names as Father and the Son, but also by the
fact that He who delivered up the kingdom, and He to whom it is
delivered up—and in like manner, He who subjected (all things), and He
to whom they were subjected—must necessarily be two different Beings.
