<span id="v.iii.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—The Apostolic Churches the
Voice of the Apostles. Let the Heretics Examine Their Apostolic Claims,
in Each Case, Indisputable. The Church of Rome Doubly Apostolic; Its
Early Eminence and Excellence. Heresy, as Perverting the Truth, is
Connected Therewith.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxxvi-p2"></span>Come now, you who would indulge a
better curiosity, if you would apply it to the business of your
salvation, run over the apostolic churches, in which the very
thrones <span id="fr_2229"></span>[2230](#fn_2229.md) of the apostles are
still pre-eminent in their places, <span
id="fr_2230"></span>[2231](#fn_2230.md) in which their own authentic
writings <span id="fr_2231"></span>[2232](#fn_2231.md) are read, uttering
the voice and representing the face of each of them severally. Achaia is
very near you, (in which) you find Corinth. Since you are not far from
Macedonia, you have Philippi; (and there too) you have the
Thessalonians. Since you are able to cross to Asia, you get Ephesus.
Since, moreover, you are close upon Italy, <span
id="fr_2232"></span>[2233](#fn_2232.md) you have Rome, from which there
comes even into our own hands the very authority (of apostles
themselves). <span id="fr_2233"></span>[2234](#fn_2233.md) How happy is its
church, on which apostles poured forth all their doctrine along with
their blood! where Peter endures a passion like his Lord’s! where Paul
wins his crown in a death like John’s <span
id="fr_2234"></span>[2235](#fn_2234.md) where the Apostle John was first
plunged, unhurt, into boiling oil, and thence remitted to his
island-exile! See what she has learned, what taught, what fellowship has
had with even (our) churches in Africa! <span
id="fr_2235"></span>[2236](#fn_2235.md) One Lord God does she acknowledge,
the Creator of the universe, and Christ Jesus (born) of the Virgin Mary,
the Son of God the Creator; and the Resurrection of the flesh; the law
and the prophets she unites <span id="fr_2236"></span>[2237](#fn_2236.md)
in one volume with the writings of evangelists and apostles, from which
she drinks in her faith. This she seals with the water (of baptism),
arrays with the Holy <span id="page_261">p. 261</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxxvi-Page_261"></span>Ghost, feeds with the Eucharist, cheers
with martyrdom, <span id="fr_2237"></span>[2238](#fn_2237.md) and against
such a discipline thus (maintained) she admits no gainsayer. This is the
discipline which I no longer say foretold that heresies should come, but
from <span id="fr_2238"></span>[2239](#fn_2238.md) which they proceeded.
However, they were not of her, because they were opposed to her. <span
id="fr_2239"></span>[2240](#fn_2239.md) Even the rough wild-olive arises
from the germ <span id="fr_2240"></span>[2241](#fn_2240.md) of the
fruitful, rich, and genuine <span id="fr_2241"></span>[2242](#fn_2241.md)
olive; also from the seed <span id="fr_2242"></span>[2243](#fn_2242.md) of
the mellowest and sweetest fig there springs the empty and useless
wild-fig. In the same way heresies, too, come from our plant, <span
id="fr_2243"></span>[2244](#fn_2243.md) although not of our kind; (they
come) from the grain of truth, <span
id="fr_2244"></span>[2245](#fn_2244.md) but, owing to their falsehood, they
have only wild leaves to show. <span
id="fr_2245"></span>[2246](#fn_2245.md)

may refer to the *autographs* or the Greek *originals* (rather than the
Latin translations), or full *unmutilated* copies as opposed to the
garbled ones of the heretics. The second sense is probably the correct
one.

<span id="v.iii.xxxvi-p11"></span> We have taken Oehler’s hint in favour
of “martyrio.” The usual reading “martyrium” (meaning “she exhorts to
martyrdom”) is stiff, and unsuited to the context.

<span id="v.iii.xxxvi-p18"></span> We again follow Oehler’s hint, who
would like to read “de grano veritatis.” The texts are obscure, and vary
much here.
