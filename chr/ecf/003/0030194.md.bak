<span id="iv.ix.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.ix.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Argument from the Destruction
of Jerusalem and Desolation of Judea.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.xiii-p2"></span>Therefore, since the sons of Israel
affirm <span id="page_169">p. 169</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xiii-Page_169"></span>that we err in receiving the Christ, who
is already come, let us put in a demurrer against them out of the
Scriptures themselves, to the effect that the Christ who was the theme
of prediction *is* come; albeit by the times of Daniel’s prediction we
*have* proved that the Christ is come already who was the theme of
announcement. Now it behoved Him to be born in Bethlehem of Judah. For
thus it is written in the prophet: “And thou, Bethlehem, are not the
least in the leaders of Judah: for out of thee shall issue a Leader who
shall feed my People Israel.” <span id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md)
But if hitherto he has not been born, what “leader” was it who was thus
announced as to proceed from the tribe of Judah, out of Bethlehem? For
it behoves him to proceed from the tribe of Judah and from Bethlehem.
But we perceive that *now* none of the race of Israel has remained in
Bethlehem; and (so it has been) ever since the interdict was issued
forbidding any one of the Jews to linger in the confines of the very
district, in order that this prophetic utterance also should be
perfectly fulfilled:  “Your land is desert, your cities burnt up by
fire,”—that is, (he is foretelling) what *will have happened* to them in
time of war “your region strangers shall eat up in your sight, and it
shall be desert and subverted by alien peoples.” <span
id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383.md) And in another place it is thus
said through the prophet: “The King with *His* glory ye shall see,”—that
is, Christ, doing deeds of power in the glory of God the Father; <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384.md) “and your eyes shall see the land
from afar,” <span id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385.md) —which is what
you do, being prohibited, in reward of your deserts, since the storming
of Jerusalem, to enter into your land; it is permitted you merely to see
it with your eyes from afar: “your soul,” he says, “shall meditate
terror,” <span id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386.md) —namely, at the time
when they suffered the ruin of themselves. <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387.md) How, therefore, will a “leader” be
born from Judea, and how far will he “proceed from Bethlehem,” as the
divine volumes of the prophets do plainly announce; since none at all is
left there to this day of (the house of) Israel, of whose stock Christ
could be born?

<span id="iv.ix.xiii-p9"></span>Now, if (according to the Jews) He is
hitherto not come, when He begins to come whence will He be
anointed? <span id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388.md) For the Law
enjoined that, in captivity, it was not lawful for the unction of the
royal chrism to be compounded. <span
id="fr_1389"></span>[1390](#fn_1389.md) But, if there is no longer
“unction” *there* <span id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390.md) as Daniel
prophesied (for he says, “Unction shall be exterminated”), it follows
that *they* <span id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391.md) no longer have
it, because neither have they a *temple* where was the “horn” <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392.md) from which kings were wont to be
anointed.  If, then, there is no unction, whence shall be anointed the
“leader” who shall be born in Bethlehem? or how shall he proceed “from
Bethlehem,” seeing that of the seed of Israel none at all exists in
Bethlehem.

<span id="iv.ix.xiii-p15"></span>A second time, in fact, let us show
that Christ is already come, (as foretold) through the prophets, and has
suffered, and is already received back in the heavens, and thence is to
come accordingly as the predictions prophesied. For, after His advent,
we read, according to Daniel, that the city itself had to be
exterminated; and we recognise that so it has befallen. For the
Scripture says thus, that “the city and the holy place are
simultaneously exterminated together with *the leader*,” <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393) —undoubtedly (that Leader.md) who was
to proceed “from Bethlehem,” and from the tribe of “Judah.” Whence,
again, it is manifest that “the city must simultaneously be
exterminated” at the time when its “Leader” had to suffer in it, (as
foretold) through the Scriptures of the prophets, who say: “I have
outstretched my hands the whole day unto a People contumacious and
gainsaying Me, who walketh in a way not good, but after their own
sins.” <span id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394.md) And in the Psalms,
*David* says: “They exterminated my hands and feet: they counted all my
bones; they themselves, moreover, contemplated and saw me, and in my
thirst slaked me with vinegar.” <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395.md) These things *David* did not
suffer, so as to seem justly to have spoken of himself; but the Christ
who was crucified.  Moreover, the “hands and feet,” are not
“exterminated,” <span id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396.md) except His
who is suspended on a “tree.”  Whence, again, David said that “the Lord
would reign *from the tree*:” <span id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397.md)
for elsewhere, too, the prophet predicts the fruit of this “tree,”
saying “The earth hath given her blessings,” <span
id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398.md) —of course that virgin-earth, not
yet irrigated with rains, nor fertilized by <span id="page_170">p.
170</span> <span id="iv.ix.xiii-Page_170"></span>showers, out of which
man was of yore first formed, out of which now Christ through the flesh
has been born of a virgin; “and *the tree*,” <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399.md) he says, “hath brought his
fruit,” <span id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400.md) —not that “tree” in
paradise which yielded death to the protoplasts, but the “tree” of the
passion of Christ, whence life, hanging, was by you not believed! <span
id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401.md) For this “tree” in a mystery, <span
id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402.md) it was of yore wherewith Moses
sweetened the bitter water; whence the People, which was perishing of
thirst in the desert, drank and revived; <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403.md) just as we do, who, drawn out from
the calamities of the heathendom <span
id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404.md) in which we were tarrying perishing
with thirst (that is, deprived of the divine word), drinking, “by the
faith which is on Him,” <span id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405.md) the
baptismal water of the “tree” of the passion of Christ, have revived,—a
faith from which Israel has fallen away, (as foretold) through Jeremiah,
who says, “Send, and ask exceedingly whether such things have been done,
whether nations will change their gods (and these are not gods!). But My
People hath changed their glory: whence no profit shall accrue to them:
the heaven turned pale thereat” (and when did it turn pale? undoubtedly
when Christ suffered), “and shuddered,” he says, “most
exceedingly;” <span id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406.md) and “the sun
grew dark at mid-day:” <span id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407.md) (and
when did it “shudder exceedingly” except at the passion of Christ, when
the earth also trembled to her centre, and the veil of the temple was
rent, and the tombs were burst asunder? <span
id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408.md) “because these two evils hath My
People done; Me,” He says, “they have quite forsaken, the fount of water
of life, <span id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409.md) and they have digged
for themselves worn-out tanks, which will not be able to contain water.”
Undoubtedly, by not receiving Christ, the “fount of water of life,” they
have begun to have “worn-out tanks,” that is, synagogues for the use of
the “dispersions of the Gentiles,” <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410.md) in which the Holy Spirit no longer
lingers, as for the time past He was wont to tarry in the temple before
the advent of Christ, who is the true temple of God. For, that they
should withal suffer this thirst of the Divine Spirit, the prophet
Isaiah had said, saying: “Behold, they who serve Me shall eat, but ye
shall be hungry; they who serve Me shall drink, but ye shall thirst, and
from general tribulation of spirit shall howl: for ye shall transmit
your name for a satiety to Mine elect, but you the Lord shall slay; but
for them who serve Me shall be named a new name, which shall be blessed
in the lands.” <span id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xiii-p35"></span>Again, the mystery of this “tree” <span
id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412.md) we read as being celebrated even in
the Books of the Reigns. For when the sons of the prophets were cutting
“wood” <span id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413.md) with axes on the bank
of the river Jordan, the iron flew off and sank in the stream; and so,
on Elisha <span id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414.md) the prophet’s
coming up, the sons of the prophets beg of him to extract from the
stream the iron which had sunk. And accordingly Elisha, having taken
“wood,” and cast it into that place where the iron had been submerged,
forthwith it rose and swam on the surface, <span
id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415.md) and the “wood” sank, which the sons
of the prophets recovered. <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416.md)
Whence they understood that Elijah’s spirit was presently conferred upon
him. <span id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417.md) What is more manifest
than the mystery <span id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418.md) of this
“wood,”—that the obduracy of this world <span
id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419.md) had been sunk in the profundity of
error, and is freed in baptism by the “wood” of Christ, that is, of His
passion; in order that what had formerly perished through the “tree” in
Adam, should be restored through the “tree” in Christ? <span
id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420.md) while we, of course, who have
succeeded to, and occupy, the room of the prophets, at the present day
sustain in the world <span id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421.md) that
treatment which the prophets always suffered on account of divine
religion: for some they stoned, some they banished; more, however, they
delivered to mortal slaughter, <span
id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422.md) —a fact which they cannot
deny. <span id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xiii-p48"></span>This “wood,” again, Isaac the son of
Abraham personally carried for his own sacrifice, when God had enjoined
that he should be made a victim to Himself. But, because these had been
mysteries <span id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424.md) which were being
kept for perfect fulfilment in the times of Christ, Isaac, on the one
hand, with his “wood,” was reserved, the ram being of<span
id="page_171">p. 171</span> <span id="iv.ix.xiii-Page_171"></span>fered
which was caught by the horns in the bramble; <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425.md) Christ, on the other hand, in His
times, carried His “wood” on His own shoulders, adhering to the horns of
the cross, with a thorny crown encircling His head. For Him it behoved
to be made a sacrifice on behalf of all Gentiles, who “was led as a
sheep for a victim, and, like a lamb voiceless before his shearer, so
opened not His mouth” (for He, when Pilate interrogated Him, spake
nothing <span id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426) .md); for “in humility
His judgment was taken away:  His nativity, moreover, who shall
declare?” Because no one at all of human beings was conscious of the
nativity of Christ at His conception, when as the Virgin Mary was found
pregnant by the word of God; and because “His life was to be taken from
the land.” <span id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md) Why, accordingly,
after His resurrection from the dead, which was effected on the third
day, did the heavens receive Him back? It was in accordance with a
prophecy of Hosea, uttered on this wise:  “Before daybreak shall they
arise unto Me, saying, Let us go and return unto the Lord our God,
because Himself will draw *us* out and free us. After a space of two
days, on the third day” <span id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md)
—which is His glorious resurrection—He received back into the heavens
(whence withal the Spirit Himself had come to the Virgin <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429) .md) Him whose nativity and passion
alike the Jews have failed to acknowledge. Therefore, since the Jews
still contend that the Christ is not yet come, whom we have in so many
ways approved <span id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) to be come, let
the Jews recognise their own fate,—a fate which they were constantly
foretold as destined to incur after the advent of the Christ, on account
of the impiety with which they despised and slew Him. For first, from
the day when, according to the saying of Isaiah, “a man cast forth his
abominations of gold and silver, which they made to adore with vain and
hurtful (rites),” <span id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md) —that is,
ever since we Gentiles, with our breast doubly enlightened through
Christ’s truth, cast forth (let the Jews see it) our idols,—what follows
has likewise been fulfilled. For “the Lord of Sabaoth *hath taken away*,
among the Jews from Jerusalem,” among the other things named, “the wise
architect” too, <span id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) who builds
the church, God’s temple, and the holy city, and the house of the Lord.
For thenceforth God’s grace desisted (from working) among them. And “the
clouds were commanded not to rain a shower upon the vineyard of
Sorek,” <span id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) —the clouds being
celestial benefits, which were commanded not to be forthcoming to the
house of Israel; for it “had borne *thorns*”—whereof that house of
Israel had wrought a crown for Christ—and not “*righteousness*, but a
*clamour*,”—the clamour whereby it had extorted His surrender to the
cross. <span id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md) And thus, the former
gifts of grace being withdrawn, “the law and the prophets were until
John,” <span id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) and the fishpool of
Bethsaida <span id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) until the advent of
Christ: thereafter it ceased curatively to remove from Israel
infirmities of health; since, as the result of their perseverance in
their frenzy, the name of the Lord was through them blasphemed, as it is
written: “On your account the name of God is blasphemed among the
Gentiles:” <span id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) for it is from
them that the infamy (attached to that name) began, and (was propagated
during) the interval from Tiberius to Vespasian. And because they had
committed these crimes, and had failed to understand that Christ “was to
be found” <span id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438.md) in “the time of
their visitation,” <span id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439.md) their land
has been made “desert, and their cities utterly burnt with fire, while
strangers devour their region in their sight: the daughter of Sion is
derelict, as a watch-tower in a vineyard, or as a shed in a cucumber
garden,”—ever since the time, to wit, when “Israel knew not” the Lord,
and “the People understood Him not;” but rather “quite forsook, and
provoked unto indignation, the Holy One of Israel.” <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440.md) So, again, we find a *conditional*
threat of *the sword*: “If ye shall have been unwilling, and shall not
have been obedient, the glaive shall eat you up.” <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441.md) Whence we prove that *the sword*
was <span class="sc"><span id="iv.ix.xiii-p66.2"></span>Christ</span>,
by not hearing whom they perished; who, again, in the Psalm, demands of
the Father their dispersion, saying, “Disperse them in Thy power;” <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) who, withal, again through Isaiah
prays for their *utter burning*. “On My account,” He says, “have these
things happened to you; in anxiety shall ye sleep.” <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xiii-p69"></span>Since, therefore, the Jews were
predicted as destined to suffer these calamities *on Christ’s account*,
and we find that they *have* suffered them, and see them sent into
dispersion and <span id="page_172">p. 172</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xiii-Page_172"></span>abiding in it, manifest it is that it is
on Christ’s account that these things *have* befallen the Jews, the
sense of the Scriptures harmonizing with the issue of events and of the
order of the times. Or else, if Christ is not yet come, on whose account
they were predicted as destined thus to suffer, when He *shall have*
come it follows that they *will* thus suffer. And where will then be a
daughter of Sion to be derelict, who *now* has no existence? where the
cities to be exust, which are already exust and in heaps? where the
dispersion of a race which is now in exile? Restore to Judea the
condition which Christ is to find; and (then, if you will), contend that
some other (Christ) is coming.
