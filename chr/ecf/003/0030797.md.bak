<span id="vi.vii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Patience Both Antecedent and
Subsequent to Faith.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.vi-p2"></span>Accordingly it is patience which is both
subsequent and antecedent to faith. In short, Abraham believed God, and
was accredited by Him with righteousness; <span
id="fr_9074"></span>[9075](#fn_9074.md) but it was patience which *proved*
his faith, when he was bidden to immolate his son, with a view to (I
would not say the temptation, but) the typical attestation of his faith.
But God knew whom He had accredited with righteousness. <span
id="fr_9075"></span>[9076](#fn_9075.md) So heavy a precept, the perfect
execution whereof was not even pleasing to the Lord, he patiently both
heard, and (if God had willed) would have fulfilled.  Deservedly then
was he “blessed,” because he was “faithful;” deservedly “faithful,”
because “patient.” So faith, illumined by patience, when it was becoming
propagated among the nations through “Abraham’s seed, which is
Christ,” <span id="fr_9076"></span>[9077](#fn_9076.md) and was
superinducing grace over the law, <span
id="fr_9077"></span>[9078](#fn_9077.md) made patience her pre-eminent
coadjutrix for amplifying and fulfilling the law, because that alone had
been lacking unto the doctrine of righteousness. For men were of old
wont to require “eye for eye, and tooth for tooth” <span
id="fr_9078"></span>[9079](#fn_9078.md) and to repay with usury “evil with
evil;” for, as yet, patience was not on earth, because faith was not
either. Of course, meantime, impatience used to enjoy the opportunities
which the law gave. That was easy, while the Lord and Master of patience
was absent. But after He has supervened, and has united <span
id="fr_9079"></span>[9080](#fn_9079.md) the grace of faith with patience,
*now* it is no longer lawful to assail even with *word*, nor to say
“fool” <span id="fr_9080"></span>[9081](#fn_9080.md) even, without “danger
of the judgment.”  Anger has been prohibited, our spirits retained, the
petulance of the hand checked, the poison of the tongue <span
id="fr_9081"></span>[9082](#fn_9081.md) extracted. The law has found more
than it has lost, while Christ says, “Love your personal enemies, and
bless your cursers, and pray for your persecutors, that ye may be sons
of your heavenly Father.” <span id="fr_9082"></span>[9083](#fn_9082.md) Do
you see whom patience gains for us as a Father? In this principal
precept the universal discipline of patience is succinctly comprised,
since evil-doing is not conceded even when it is deserved.
