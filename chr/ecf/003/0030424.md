<span id="v.iv.v.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Christ Thanks the Father for
Revealing to Babes What He Had Concealed from the Wise. This Concealment
Judiciously Effected by the Creator. Other Points in St. Luke’s Chap. X.
Shown to Be Only Possible to the Creator’s Christ.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxv-p2"></span>Who shall be invoked as the Lord of
heaven, that does not first show Himself <span
id="fr_4464"></span>[4465](#fn_4464.md) to have been the maker thereof? For
He says, “I thank thee, (O Father,) and own Thee, Lord of heaven,
because those things which had been hidden from the wise and prudent,
Thou has revealed unto babes.” <span
id="fr_4465"></span>[4466](#fn_4465.md) What things are these? And whose? 
And by whom hidden? And by whom revealed? If it was by Marcion’s god
that they were hidden and revealed, it was an extremely iniquitous
proceeding; <span id="fr_4466"></span>[4467](#fn_4466.md) for nothing at
all had he ever produced <span id="fr_4467"></span>[4468](#fn_4467.md) in
which anything could have been hidden—no prophecies, no parables, no
visions, no evidences <span id="fr_4468"></span>[4469](#fn_4468.md) of
things, or words, or names, obscured by allegories and figures, or
cloudy enigmas, but he had concealed the greatness even of himself,
which he was with all his might revealing by his Christ.  Now in what
respect had the wise and prudent done wrong, <span
id="fr_4469"></span>[4470](#fn_4469.md) that God should be hidden from
them, when their wisdom and prudence had been insufficient to come to
the knowledge of Him?  No way had been provided by himself, <span
id="fr_4470"></span>[4471](#fn_4470.md) by any declaration of his works, or
any vestiges whereby they might become <span
id="fr_4471"></span>[4472](#fn_4471.md) wise and prudent. However, if they
had even failed in any duty towards a god whom they knew not, suppose
him now at last to be known still they ought not to have found a jealous
god in him who is introduced as unlike the Creator.  Therefore, since he
had neither provided any materials in which he could have hidden
anything, nor had any offenders from whom he could have hidden himself:
since, again, even if he had had any, he ought not to have hidden
himself from them, he will not now be himself the revealer, who was not
previously the concealer; so neither will any be the Lord of heaven nor
the Father of Christ but He in whom all these attributes consistently
meet. <span id="fr_4472"></span>[4473](#fn_4472.md) For He conceals by His
preparatory apparatus of prophetic obscurity, the understanding of which
is open to faith (for “if ye will not believe, ye shall not
understand” <span id="fr_4473"></span>[4474](#fn_4473) .md); and He had
offenders in those wise and prudent ones who would not seek after God,
although He was to be discovered in His so many and mighty works, <span
id="fr_4474"></span>[4475](#fn_4474.md) or who rashly philosophized about
Him, and thereby furnished to heretics their arts; <span
id="fr_4475"></span>[4476](#fn_4475.md) and lastly, He is a jealous God. 
Accordingly, <span id="fr_4476"></span>[4477](#fn_4476.md) that which
Christ thanks God for doing, He long ago <span
id="fr_4477"></span>[4478](#fn_4477.md) announced by Isaiah: “I will
destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the prudent
will I hide.” <span id="fr_4478"></span>[4479](#fn_4478.md) So in another
passage He intimates both that He has concealed, and that He will also
reveal:  “I will give unto them treasures that have been hidden, and
secret ones will I discover to them.” <span
id="fr_4479"></span>[4480](#fn_4479.md) And again:  “Who else shall scatter
the tokens of ventriloquists, <span id="fr_4480"></span>[4481](#fn_4480.md)
and the devices of those who divine out of their own heart; turning wise
men backward, and making their counsels foolish?” <span
id="fr_4481"></span>[4482](#fn_4481.md) Now, if He has designated His
Christ as an enlightener of the Gentiles, saying, “I have set thee for a
light of the Gentiles;” <span id="fr_4482"></span>[4483](#fn_4482.md) and
if we understand these to be meant in the word *babes* <span
id="fr_4483"></span>[4484](#fn_4483.md) —as having been once dwarfs in
knowledge and infants in prudence, and even now also babes in their
lowliness of faith—we shall of course more easily understand how He who
had once hidden “these things,” and promised a revelation of them
through Christ, was the same God as He who had now revealed them unto
babes. Else, if it was Marcion’s god who revealed the things which had
been formerly hidden by the Creator, it follows <span
id="fr_4484"></span>[4485](#fn_4484.md) that he did the Creator’s work by
setting forth His deeds. <span id="fr_4485"></span>[4486](#fn_4485.md) But
he did it, say you, for His destruction, that he might refute
them. <span id="fr_4486"></span>[4487](#fn_4486.md) Therefore he ought to
have refuted them to those from whom the Creator had hidden them, even
the wise and prudent. For if he had a kind intention in what he did, the
gift of knowledge was due to those from whom the Creator had detained
it, instead of the *babes*, to whom the Creator had grudged no gift. But
after all, it is, I presume, the edifica<span id="page_390">p.
390</span> <span id="v.iv.v.xxv-Page_390"></span>tion <span
id="fr_4487"></span>[4488](#fn_4487.md) rather than the demolition <span
id="fr_4488"></span>[4489](#fn_4488.md) of the law and the prophets which
we have thus far found effected in Christ. “All things,” He says, “are
delivered unto me of my Father.” <span
id="fr_4489"></span>[4490](#fn_4489.md) You may believe Him, if He is the
Christ of the Creator to whom all things belong; because the Creator has
not delivered to a Son who is less than Himself all things, which He
created by <span id="fr_4490"></span>[4491](#fn_4490.md) Him, that is to
say, by His Word. If, on the contrary, he is the notorious
stranger, <span id="fr_4491"></span>[4492](#fn_4491.md) what are the “*all
things*” which have been delivered to him by the Father? Are they the
Creator’s? Then the things which the Father delivered to the Son are
good, and the Creator is therefore good, since all His “things” are
good; whereas he <span id="fr_4492"></span>[4493](#fn_4492.md) is no longer
good who has invaded another’s good (domains) to deliver it to his son,
thus teaching robbery <span id="fr_4493"></span>[4494](#fn_4493.md) of
another’s goods. Surely he must be a most mendacious being, who had no
other means of enriching his son than by helping himself to another’s
property!  Or else, <span id="fr_4494"></span>[4495](#fn_4494.md) if
nothing of the Creator’s has been delivered to him by the Father, by
what right <span id="fr_4495"></span>[4496](#fn_4495.md) does he claim for
himself (authority over) man?  Or again, if man has been delivered to
him, and man alone, then man is not “all things.” But Scripture clearly
says that a transfer of *all things* has been made to the Son. If,
however, you should interpret this “*all*” of the whole human race, that
is, *all nations*, then the delivery of even *these* to the Son is
within the purpose of the Creator: <span
id="fr_4496"></span>[4497](#fn_4496.md) “I will give Thee the heathen for
Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy
possession.” <span id="fr_4497"></span>[4498](#fn_4497.md) If, indeed, he
has some things of his own, the whole of which he might give to his son,
along with the *man* of the Creator, then show some one thing of them
all, as a sample, that I may believe; lest I should have as much reason
not to believe that all things belong to him, of whom I see nothing, as
I have ground for believing that even the things which I see not are
His, to whom belongs the universe, which I see.  But “no man knoweth who
the Father is, but the Son; and who the Son is, but the Father, and he
to whom the Son will reveal Him.” <span
id="fr_4498"></span>[4499](#fn_4498.md) And so it was an unknown god that
Christ preached! And other heretics, too, prop themselves up by this
passage; alleging in opposition to it that the Creator was known to all,
both to Israel by familiar intercourse, and to the Gentiles by nature.
Well, how is it He Himself testifies that He was not known to Israel? 
“But Israel doth not know me, and my people doth not consider me;” <span
id="fr_4499"></span>[4500](#fn_4499.md) nor to the Gentiles: “For, behold,”
says He, “of the nations I have no man.” <span
id="fr_4500"></span>[4501](#fn_4500.md) Therefore He reckoned them “as the
drop of a bucket,” <span id="fr_4501"></span>[4502](#fn_4501.md) while
“Sion He left as a look-out <span id="fr_4502"></span>[4503](#fn_4502.md)
in a vineyard.” <span id="fr_4503"></span>[4504](#fn_4503.md) See, then,
whether there be not here a confirmation of the prophet’s word, when he
rebukes that ignorance of man toward God which continued to the days of
the Son of man. For it was on this account that he inserted the clause
that the Father is known by him to whom the Son has revealed Him,
because it was even He who was announced as set by the Father to be a
light to the Gentiles, who of course required to be enlightened
concerning God, as well as to Israel, even by imparting to it a fuller
knowledge of God. Arguments, therefore, will be of no use for belief in
the rival god which may be suitable <span
id="fr_4504"></span>[4505](#fn_4504.md) for the Creator, because it is only
such as are unfit for the Creator which will be able to advance belief
in His rival.  If you look also into the next words, “Blessed are the
eyes which see the things which ye see, for I tell you that prophets
have not seen the things which ye see,” <span
id="fr_4505"></span>[4506](#fn_4505.md) you will find that they follow from
the sense above, that no man indeed had come to the knowledge of God as
he ought to have done, <span id="fr_4506"></span>[4507](#fn_4506.md) since
even the prophets had not seen the things which were being seen under
Christ. Now if He had not been my Christ, He would not have made any
mention of the prophets in this passage. For what was there to wonder
at, if they had not seen the things of a god who had been unknown to
them, and was only revealed a long time after them? What blessedness,
however, could theirs have been, who were then seeing what others were
naturally <span id="fr_4507"></span>[4508](#fn_4507.md) unable to see,
since it was of things which they had never predicted that they had not
obtained the sight; <span id="fr_4508"></span>[4509](#fn_4508.md) if it
were not because they might justly <span
id="fr_4509"></span>[4510](#fn_4509.md) have seen the things pertaining to
their God, which they had even predicted, but which they at the same
time <span id="fr_4510"></span>[4511](#fn_4510.md) had not seen? This,
however, will be the blessedness of others, even of such as were seeing
the things which <span id="page_391">p. 391</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxv-Page_391"></span>others had only foretold. We shall by
and by show, nay, we have already shown, that in Christ those things
were seen which had been foretold, but yet had been hidden from the very
prophets who foretold them, in order that they might be hidden also from
the wise and the prudent. In the true Gospel, a certain doctor of the
law comes to the Lord and asks, “What shall I do to inherit *eternal*
life?” In the heretical gospel life only is mentioned, without the
attribute *eternal*; so that the lawyer seems to have consulted Christ
simply about the life which the Creator in the law promises to
prolong, <span id="fr_4511"></span>[4512](#fn_4511.md) and the Lord to have
therefore answered him according to the law, “Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
strength,” <span id="fr_4512"></span>[4513](#fn_4512.md) since the question
was concerning the conditions of *mere* life. But the lawyer of course
knew very well in what way the life which the law meant <span
id="fr_4513"></span>[4514](#fn_4513.md) was to be obtained, so that his
question could have had no relation to the life whose rules he was
himself in the habit of teaching. But seeing that even the dead were now
raised by Christ, and being himself excited to the hope of an eternal
life by these examples of a restored <span
id="fr_4514"></span>[4515](#fn_4514.md) one, he would lose no more time in
merely looking on (at the wonderful things which had made him) so high
in hope. <span id="fr_4515"></span>[4516](#fn_4515.md) He therefore
consulted him about the attainment of eternal life. Accordingly, the
Lord, being Himself the same, <span id="fr_4516"></span>[4517](#fn_4516.md)
and introducing no new precept other than that which relates above all
others <span id="fr_4517"></span>[4518](#fn_4517) to (man’s.md) entire
salvation, even including the present and the future life, <span
id="fr_4518"></span>[4519](#fn_4518.md) places before him <span
id="fr_4519"></span>[4520](#fn_4519.md) the very essence <span
id="fr_4520"></span>[4521](#fn_4520.md) of the law—that he should in every
possible way love the Lord his God. If, indeed, it were only about a
lengthened life, such as is at the Creator’s disposal, that he inquired
and Christ answered, and not about the eternal life, which is at the
disposal of Marcion’s god, how is he to obtain the eternal one?  Surely
not in the same manner as the prolonged life. For in proportion to the
difference of the reward must be supposed to be also the diversity of
the services. Therefore your disciple, Marcion, <span
id="fr_4521"></span>[4522](#fn_4521.md) will not obtain his eternal life in
consequence of loving your God, in the same way as the man who loves the
Creator will secure the lengthened life. But how happens it that, if He
is to be loved who promises the prolonged life, He is not much more to
be loved who offers the eternal life? Therefore both one and the other
life will be at the disposal of one and the same Lord; because one and
the same discipline is to be followed <span
id="fr_4522"></span>[4523](#fn_4522.md) for one and the other life. What
the Creator teaches to be loved, that must He necessarily maintain <span
id="fr_4523"></span>[4524](#fn_4523.md) also by Christ, <span
id="fr_4524"></span>[4525](#fn_4524.md) for that rule holds good here,
which prescribes that greater things ought to be believed of Him who has
first lesser proofs to show, than of him for whom no preceding smaller
presumptions have secured a claim to be believed in things of higher
import. It matters not <span id="fr_4525"></span>[4526](#fn_4525.md) then,
whether the word *eternal* has been interpolated by us. <span
id="fr_4526"></span>[4527](#fn_4526.md) It is enough for me, that the
Christ who invited men to the eternal—not the lengthened—life, when
consulted about the temporal life which he was destroying, did not
choose to exhort the man rather to that eternal life which he was
introducing.  Pray, what would the Creator’s Christ have done, if He who
had made man for loving the Creator did not belong to the Creator? I
suppose He would have said that the Creator was not to be loved!
