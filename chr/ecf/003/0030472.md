<span id="v.v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—An Argument of Hermogenes. The
Answer:  While God is a Title Eternally Applicable to the Divine Being,
Lord and Father are Only Relative Appellations, Not Eternally
Applicable. An Inconsistency in the Argument of Hermogenes Pointed
Out.</span>

<span id="v.v.iii-p2"></span>He adds also another point: that as God was
always God, there was never a time when God was not also Lord. 
But <span id="fr_6150"></span>[6151](#fn_6150) it was in no way possible
for Him to be regarded as always Lord, in the same manner as He had been
always God, if there had not been always, in the previous
eternity, <span id="fr_6151"></span>[6152](#fn_6151) a something of
which He could be regarded as evermore the Lord. So he concludes <span
id="fr_6152"></span>[6153](#fn_6152) that God always had Matter
co-existent with Himself as the Lord thereof. Now, this tissue <span
id="fr_6153"></span>[6154](#fn_6153) of his I shall at once hasten to
pull abroad.  I have been willing to set it out in form to this length,
for the information of those who are unacquainted with the subject, that
they may know that his other arguments likewise need only be <span
id="fr_6154"></span>[6155](#fn_6154) understood to be refuted. We
affirm, then, that the name of *God* always existed with Himself and in
Himself—but not eternally so the *Lord*.  Because the condition of the
one is not the same as that of the other. God is the designation of the
substance itself, that is, of the Divinity; but Lord is (the name) not
of substance, but of power. I *maintain* that the substance existed
always with its own name, which is God; *the title* Lord was afterwards
added, as the indication indeed <span
id="fr_6155"></span>[6156](#fn_6155) of something accruing. For from the
moment when those things began to exist, over which the power of a Lord
was to act, *God*, by the accession of that power, both became Lord and
received the name thereof. Because God is in like manner a Father, and
He is also a Judge; but He has not always been Father and Judge, merely
on the ground of His having always been God.  For He could not have been
the Father previous to the Son, nor a Judge previous to sin. There was,
however, a time when neither sin existed with Him, nor the Son; the
former of which was to constitute the Lord a Judge, and the latter a
Father. In this way He was not Lord previous to those things of which He
was to be the Lord.  But He was only to become Lord at some future time:
just as He became the Father by the Son, and a Judge by sin, so also did
He become Lord by means of those things which He had made, in order that
they might serve Him.  Do I seem to you to be weaving arguments, <span
id="fr_6156"></span>[6157](#fn_6156) Hermogenes? How neatly does
Scripture lend us its aid, <span id="fr_6157"></span>[6158](#fn_6157)
when it applies the two titles to Him with a distinction, and reveals
them each at its proper time! For (the title) *God*, indeed, which <span
id="page_479">p. 479</span> <span id="v.v.iii-Page_479"></span>always
belonged to Him, it names at the very first: “In the beginning God
created the heaven and the earth;” <span
id="fr_6158"></span>[6159](#fn_6158) and as long as He continued making,
one after the other, those things of which He was to be the Lord, it
merely mentions God.  “And *God* said,” “and *God* made,” “and *God*
saw;” <span id="fr_6159"></span>[6160](#fn_6159) but nowhere do we yet
find the *Lord*. But when He completed the whole creation, and
especially man himself, who was destined to understand His sovereignty
in a way of special propriety, He then is designated <span
id="fr_6160"></span>[6161](#fn_6160) Lord. Then also *the Scripture*
added the name *Lord*: “And the Lord God, *Deus Dominus*, took the man,
whom He had formed;” <span id="fr_6161"></span>[6162](#fn_6161) “And the
Lord God commanded Adam.” <span id="fr_6162"></span>[6163](#fn_6162)
Thenceforth He, who was previously God only, is the *Lord*, from the
time of His having something of which He might be the Lord.  For to
Himself He was always God, but to all things was He only then God, when
He became also Lord. Therefore, in *as* far as (Hermogenes) shall
suppose that Matter was eternal, on the ground that the Lord was
eternal, in *so* far will it be evident that nothing existed, because it
is plain that the Lord *as such* did not always exist. Now I mean also,
on my own part, <span id="fr_6163"></span>[6164](#fn_6163) to add a
remark for the sake of ignorant persons, of whom Hermogenes is an
extreme instance, <span id="fr_6164"></span>[6165](#fn_6164) and
actually to retort against him his own arguments. <span
id="fr_6165"></span>[6166](#fn_6165) For when he denies that Matter was
born or made, I find that, even on these terms, the title *Lord* is
unsuitable to God in respect of Matter, because it must have been
free, <span id="fr_6166"></span>[6167](#fn_6166) when by not having a
beginning it had not an author. The fact of its past existence it owed
to no one, so that it could be a subject to no one.  Therefore ever
since God exercised His power over it, by creating (all things) out of
Matter, although it had all along experienced God as its Lord, yet
Matter does, after all, demonstrate that God did not exist in the
relation of Lord to it, <span id="fr_6167"></span>[6168](#fn_6167)
although all the while He was really so. <span
id="fr_6168"></span>[6169](#fn_6168)

opinion, which is thus shown to have been contradictory to itself, and
so absurd.
