id="v.viii.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Elucidations.</span>

<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p3"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="v.viii.lxiv-p3.1"></span>I.</span>

<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p4"></span>(Cadaver, cap. xviii. p. 588.*)*

<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p5"></span>The Schoolmen and middle-age jurists
improved on Tertullian’s etymology.  He says,—“a cadendo—*cadaver*.” But
they form the word thus: *Ca*ro *da*ta *ver*mibus = *Ca-da-ver*.

<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p6"></span>On this subject see a most interesting
discourse of the (paradoxical and sophistical, nay the whimsical) Count
Joseph de Maistre, in his *Soirées de St. Pétersbourg*. <span
id="fr_7763"></span>[7764](#fn_7763.md) He <span id="page_595">p.
595</span> <span id="v.viii.lxiv-Page_595"></span>remarks on the happy
formation of many Latin words, in this manner:  *e.g., Cæcus ut ire =
Cæcutire*, “to grope like a blind man.” The French, he says, are not
without such examples, and he instances the word *<span
id="v.viii.lxiv-p7.1"></span>ancêtre* = ancestor, as composed out of
*<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p7.2"></span>ancien* and *ê<span
id="v.viii.lxiv-p7.3"></span>tre*, i.e., one of a former existence.
*Courage*, he says, is formed from *<span
id="v.viii.lxiv-p7.4"></span>cæur* and *<span
id="v.viii.lxiv-p7.5"></span>rage*<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p7.6"></span>,
this use of rage being the Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.viii.lxiv-p7.7"></span>θυμος</span>. He supposes that the English
use the word rage in this sense, but I recall only the instance:

<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p8"></span>“Chill penury repressed their noble
rage,”

<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p9"></span>from Gray’s Elegy. The *Diversions of
Purley*, of Horne-Tooke, supply amusing examples of the like in the
formation of English words.

<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p10"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="v.viii.lxiv-p10.1"></span>II.</span>

<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p11"></span>(His flesh, the Bread, cap. xxxvii. p.
572.)

<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p12"></span>Note our author’s exposition. He
censures those who understood our Lord’s words after the letter, as if
they were to eat the carnal body. He expounds the *spiritual thing*
which gives life as to be understood by the text: “the words that I
speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.” His word is the
life-giving principle and therefore he called his flesh by the same
name:  and we are to “devour Him with the ear and to ruminate on Him
with the understanding, and to digest Him by faith.”  The flesh profits
nothing, the spirit imparts life. Now, was Tertullian ever censured for
this exposition? On the contrary, this was the faith of the Catholic
Church, from the beginning. Our Saxon forefathers taught the same, as
appears from the *Homily of Ælfric*, <span
id="fr_7764"></span>[7765](#fn_7764.md) <span class="sc"><span
id="v.viii.lxiv-p13.2"></span>a.d.</span> 980, and from the exposition
of Ratramn, <span class="sc"><span
id="v.viii.lxiv-p13.3"></span>a.d.</span> 840. The heresy of
Transubstantiation was not dogmatic even among Latins, until the
Thirteenth century, and it prevailed in England less than three hundred
years, when the Catholic doctrine was restored, through the influence of
Ratramn’s treatise first upon the mind of Ridley and then by Ridley’s
arguments with Cranmer. Thus were their understandings opened to the
Scriptures and to the acknowledging of the Truth, for which they
suffered martyrdom. To the reformation we owe the rescue of Ante-Nicene
doctrine from the perversions of the Schoolmen and the gradual
corruptions of doctrine after the Ninth Century.

<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p14"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="v.viii.lxiv-p14.1"></span>III.</span>

<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p15"></span>(Paradise, cap. xliii. p. 576.)

<span id="v.viii.lxiv-p16"></span>This sentence reads, in the
translation I am editing, as follows:  “No one, on becoming absent from
the body, is at once a dweller in the presence of the Lord, except by
the prerogative of martyrdom, whereby (the saint) gets at once a lodging
in Paradise, not in *Hades*.” But the original does not say precisely
this, nor does the author use the Greek word *Hades*. His words are:
“Nemo enim peregrinatus a corpore statim immoratur penes Dominum nisi ex
martyrii prœrogativa Paradiso silicet non Inferis diversurus.” The
passage therefore, is not necessarily as inconsistent with the author’s
topography of the invisible world, as might seem. “Not in the regions
beneath Paradise but in Paradise itself,” seems to be the idea; Paradise
being included in the world of *Hades*, indeed, but in a lofty region,
far enough removed from the *Inferi*, and refreshed by light from the
third Heaven and the throne itself, (as this planet is by the light of
the Sun,) immensely distant though it be from the final abode of the
Redeemed.
