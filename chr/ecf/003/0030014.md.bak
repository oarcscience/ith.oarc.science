id="iv.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p2"></span>See now, we set before you the reward
of these enormities. They give promise of eternal life. Hold it
meanwhile as your own belief. I ask you, then, whether, so believing,
you think it worth attaining with a conscience such as you will have.
Come, plunge your knife into the babe, enemy of none, accused of none,
child of all; or if that is another’s work, simply take your place
beside a human being dying before he has really lived, await the
departure of the lately given soul, receive the fresh young blood,
saturate your bread with it, freely partake. The while as you recline at
table, take note of the places which your mother and your sister occupy;
mark them well, so that when the dog-made darkness has fallen on you,
you may make no mistake, for you will be guilty of a crime—unless you
perpetrate a deed of incest. Initiated and sealed into things like
these, you have life everlasting. Tell me, I pray you, is eternity worth
it? If it is not, then these things are not to be credited.  Even
although you had the belief, I deny the will; and even if you had the
will, I deny the possibility. Why then can others do it, if you cannot?
why cannot you, if others can? I suppose we are of a different
nature—are we Cynopæ or Sciapodes? <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md)
You are a man yourself as well as the Christian: if you cannot do it,
you ought not to believe it of others, for a Christian is a man as well
as you. But the ignorant, forsooth, are deceived and imposed on. They
were quite unaware of anything of the kind being imputed to Christians,
or they would certainly have looked into it for themselves, and searched
the matter out. Instead of that, it is the custom for persons wishing
initiation into sacred rites, I think, to go first of all to the master
of them, that he may explain what preparations are to be made. Then, in
this case, no doubt he would say, “You must have a child still of tender
age, that knows not what it is to die, and can smile under thy knife;
bread, too, to collect the gushing blood; in addition to these,
candlesticks, and lamps, and dogs—with tid-bits to draw them on to the
extinguishing of the lights:  above all things, you will require to
bring your mother and your sister with you.” But what if mother and
sister are unwilling? or if there be neither the one nor the other? What
if there are Christians with no Christian relatives? He will not be
counted, I suppose, a true follower of Christ, who has not a brother or
a son. And what now, if these things are all in store for them without
their knowledge?  At least afterwards they come to know them; and they
bear with them, and pardon them. They fear, it may be said, lest they
have to pay for it if they let the secret out: nay, but they will rather
in that case have every claim to protection; they will even prefer, one
might think, dying by their own hand, to living under the burden of such
a dreadful knowledge. Admit that they have this fear; yet why do they
still persevere? For it is plain enough that you will have no desire to
continue what you would never have been, if you had had previous
knowledge of it.
