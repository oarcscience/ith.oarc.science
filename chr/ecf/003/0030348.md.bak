<span id="v.iv.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Next Stage Occurs in the
Creation of Man by the Eternal Word. Spiritual as Well as Physical Gifts
to Man. The Blessings of Man’s Free-Will.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.iv-p2"></span>The goodness of God having, therefore,
provided man for the pursuit of the knowledge of Himself, added this to
its original notification, <span id="fr_2738"></span>[2739](#fn_2738.md)
that it first prepared a habitation for him, the vast fabric (of the
world) to begin with, and then afterwards <span
id="fr_2739"></span>[2740](#fn_2739.md) the vaster one (of a higher
world, <span id="fr_2740"></span>[2741](#fn_2740) .md) that he might on a
great as well as on a smaller stage practise and advance in his
probation, and so be promoted from the *good* which God had given him,
that is, from his high position, to God’s *best*; that is, to some
higher abode. <span id="fr_2741"></span>[2742](#fn_2741.md) In this good
work *God* employs a most excellent minister, even His own Word. “My
heart,” He says, “hath emitted my most excellent Word.” <span
id="fr_2742"></span>[2743](#fn_2742.md) Let Marcion take hence his first
lesson on the noble fruit of this truly most excellent tree. But, like a
most clumsy clown, he has grafted a good branch on a bad stock. The
sapling, however, of his blasphemy shall be never strong: it shall
wither with its planter, and thus shall be manifested the nature of the
good tree. Look at the total result: how fruitful was the Word! God
issued His *fiat*, and it was done: God also saw that it was <span
id="page_300">p. 300</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.iv-Page_300"></span>good; <span
id="fr_2743"></span>[2744](#fn_2743.md) not as if He were ignorant of the
good until He saw it; but because it was good, He therefore saw it, and
honoured it, and set His seal upon it; and consummated <span
id="fr_2744"></span>[2745](#fn_2744.md) the goodness of His works by His
vouchsafing to them that contemplation. Thus God blessed what He made
good, in order that He might commend Himself to you as whole and
perfect, good both in word and act. <span
id="fr_2745"></span>[2746](#fn_2745.md) As yet the Word knew no
malediction, because He was a stranger to malefaction. <span
id="fr_2746"></span>[2747](#fn_2746.md) We shall see what reasons required
*this* also of God. Meanwhile the world consisted of all things good,
plainly foreshowing how much good was preparing for him for whom all
this was provided. Who indeed was so worthy of dwelling amongst the
works of God, as he who was His own image and likeness? That image was
wrought out by a goodness even more operative than its wont, <span
id="fr_2747"></span>[2748](#fn_2747.md) with no imperious word, but with
friendly hand preceded by an almost affable <span
id="fr_2748"></span>[2749](#fn_2748.md) utterance: “Let us make man in our
image, after our likeness.” <span id="fr_2749"></span>[2750](#fn_2749.md)
Goodness spake the word; Goodness formed man of the dust of the ground
into so great a substance of the flesh, built up out of one material
with so many qualities; Goodness breathed into him a soul, not dead but
living. Goodness gave him dominion <span
id="fr_2750"></span>[2751](#fn_2750.md) over all things, which he was to
enjoy and rule over, and even give names to. In addition to this,
Goodness annexed pleasures <span id="fr_2751"></span>[2752](#fn_2751.md) to
man so that, while master of the whole world, <span
id="fr_2752"></span>[2753](#fn_2752.md) he might tarry among higher
delights, being translated into paradise, out of the world into the
Church. <span id="fr_2753"></span>[2754](#fn_2753.md) The self-same
Goodness provided also a help meet for him, that there might be nothing
in his lot that was not good. For, said He, that the man be alone is not
good. <span id="fr_2754"></span>[2755](#fn_2754.md) He knew full well what
a blessing to him would be the sex of Mary, <span
id="fr_2755"></span>[2756](#fn_2755.md) and also of the Church. The law,
however, which you find fault with, <span
id="fr_2756"></span>[2757](#fn_2756.md) and wrest into a subject of
contention, was imposed on man by Goodness, aiming at his happiness,
that he might cleave to God, and so not show himself an abject creature
rather than a free one, nor reduce himself to the level of the other
animals, his subjects, which were free from God, and exempt from all
tedious subjection; <span id="fr_2757"></span>[2758](#fn_2757.md) but
might, as the sole human being, boast that he alone was worthy of
receiving laws from God; and as a rational being, capable of
intelligence and knowledge, be restrained within the bounds of rational
liberty, subject to Him who had subjected all things unto him. To secure
the observance of this law, Goodness likewise took counsel by help of
this sanction: “In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely
die.” <span id="fr_2758"></span>[2759](#fn_2758.md) For it was a most
benignant act of His thus to point out the issues of transgression, lest
ignorance of the danger should encourage a neglect of obedience. Now,
since <span id="fr_2759"></span>[2760](#fn_2759.md) it was given as a
reason previous to the imposition of the law, it also amounted to a
motive for subsequently observing it, that a penalty was annexed to its
transgression; a penalty, indeed, which He who proposed it was still
unwilling that it should be incurred.  Learn then the goodness of our
God amidst these things and up to this point; learn it from His
excellent works, from His kindly blessings, from His indulgent bounties,
from His gracious providences, from His laws and warnings, so good and
merciful.

is Tertullian’s reading of [Ps. xlv.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md)<span id="v.iv.iii.iv-p7.1"></span>,
“My heart is inditing a good matter,” A.V., which the Vulgate, [Ps.
xliv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.iv.iii.iv-p7.2"></span>, renders by “Eructavit cor meum verbum
bonum,” and the Septuagint by <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.iii.iv-p7.3"></span>᾽Εξηρεύξατο ἡ καρδία μου λόγον
ἀγαθόν</span>. This is a tolerably literal rendering of the original
words, <span class="Hebrew"><span id="v.iv.iii.iv-p7.4"></span>בוֹט
רבָרָ יבִּלִ שׁהַרָ</span>. In these words the Fathers used to descry an
adumbration of the mystery of the Son’s eternal generation from the
Father, and His coming forth in time to create the world.  See
Bellarmine, *On the Psalms* (Paris ed. 1861), vol. i. 292. The Psalm is
no doubt eminently Messianic, as both Jewish and Christian writers have
ever held. See Perowne, *The Psalms*, vol. i. p. 216.  Bishop Bull
reviews at length the theological opinions of Tertullian, and shows that
he held the eternity of the Son of God, whom he calls “Sermo” or “Verbum
Dei.” See *Defensio Fidei Nicænæ* (translation in the “Oxford Library of
the Fathers,” by the translator of this work) vol. ii. 509–545. In the
same volume, p. 482, the passage from the Psalm before us is similarly
applied by Novatian: “Sic Dei Verbum processit, de quo dictum est,
*Eructavit cor meum Verbum bonum*.” \[See vol. ii. p. 98, this series:
and Kaye, p. 515.\]

<span id="v.iv.iii.iv-p18"></span> There is a profound thought here; in
his tract, *De Pœnit*. 10, he says, “Where *one* *or* *two* are, is the
church, and the church is Christ.” Hence what he here calls Adam’s
“higher delights,” even spiritual blessings in Christ with Eve.
