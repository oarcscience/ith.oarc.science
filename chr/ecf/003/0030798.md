<span id="vi.vii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Causes of Impatience, and
Their Correspondent Precepts.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.vii-p2"></span>Now, however, while we run through the
causes of impatience, all the other precepts also will answer in their
own places. If our spirit is aroused by the loss of property, it is
commonished by the Lord’s Scriptures, in almost every place, to a
contemning of the world; <span id="fr_9083"></span>[9084](#fn_9083.md) nor
is there any more powerful exhortation to contempt of money
submitted <span id="fr_9084"></span>[9085](#fn_9084) (to us.md), than (*the
fact*) the Lord Himself is found amid no riches. He always justifies the
poor, fore-condemns the rich. So He fore-ministered to patience “loss,”
and to opulence “contempt” (as portion); <span
id="fr_9085"></span>[9086](#fn_9085.md) demonstrating, by means of (His
own) *repudiation* of riches, that *hurts* done to them also are not to
be much regarded. Of that, therefore, which we have not the smallest
need to seek after, because the Lord did not seek after it either, we
ought to endure without heart-sickness the cutting down or taking away. 
“Covetousness,” the Spirit of the Lord has through the apostle
pronounced “a root of all evils.” <span
id="fr_9086"></span>[9087](#fn_9086.md) Let us not interpret that
*covetousness* as consisting merely in the concupiscence of what is
another’s: for even what *seems* ours *is* another’s; for nothing is
ours, since all things are God’s, whose are we also ourselves. And so,
if, when suffering from a loss, we feel impatiently, grieving for what
is lost from what is not our own, we shall be detected as bordering on
covetousness:  we *seek* what is another’s when we ill brook *losing*
what is another’s. He who is greatly stirred with impatience of a loss,
does, by giving things earthly the precedence over things heavenly, sin
directly <span id="fr_9087"></span>[9088](#fn_9087.md) against God; for the
Spirit, which he has received from the Lord, he <span id="page_712">p.
712</span> <span id="vi.vii.vii-Page_712"></span>greatly shocks for the
sake of a worldly matter. Willingly, therefore, let us lose things
earthly, let us keep things heavenly. Perish the whole world, <span
id="fr_9088"></span>[9089](#fn_9088.md) so I may make patience my gain! In
truth, I know not whether he who has not made up his mind to endure with
constancy the loss of somewhat of his, either by theft, or else by
force, or else even by carelessness, would himself readily or heartily
lay hand on his own property in the cause of almsgiving:  for who that
endures not at all to be cut by another, himself draws the sword on his
own body? Patience in losses is an exercise in bestowing and
communicating. Who fears not to lose, finds it not irksome to give. Else
how will one, when he has two coats, give the one of them to the
naked, <span id="fr_9089"></span>[9090](#fn_9089.md) unless he be a man
likewise to offer to one who takes away his coat his cloak as
well? <span id="fr_9090"></span>[9091](#fn_9090.md) How shall we fashion to
us friends from mammon, <span id="fr_9091"></span>[9092](#fn_9091.md) if we
love it so much as not to put up with its loss? We shall perish together
with the lost *mammon*.  Why do we *find* here, where it is our business
to *lose*? <span id="fr_9092"></span>[9093](#fn_9092.md) To exhibit
impatience at all losses is the Gentiles’ business, who give money the
precedence perhaps over their soul; for so they do, when, in their
cupidities of lucre, they encounter the gainful perils of commerce on
the sea; when, for money’s sake, even in the forum, there is nothing
which damnation (itself) would fear which they hesitate to essay; when
they hire themselves for sport and the camp; when, after the manner of
wild beasts, they play the bandit along the highway. But us, according
to the diversity by which we are distinguished from them, it becomes to
lay down not our soul for money, but money for our soul, whether
spontaneously in bestowing or patiently in losing.
