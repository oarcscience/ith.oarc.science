<span id="v.iv.v.vi"></span>

<span id="v.iv.v.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Marcion’s Object in Adulterating
the Gospel. No Difference Between the Christ of the Creator and the
Christ of the Gospel. No Rival Christ Admissible. The Connection of the
True Christ with the Dispensation of the Old Testament Asserted.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.vi-p2"></span>But we now advance a step further on, and
challenge (as we promised to do) the very Gospel of Marcion, with the
intention of thus proving that it has been adulterated. For it is
certain <span id="fr_3619"></span>[3620](#fn_3619.md) that the whole aim at
which he has strenuously laboured even in the drawing up of his
*Antitheses*, centres in this, that he may establish a diversity between
the Old and the New Testaments, so that his own Christ may be separate
from the Creator, as belonging to this rival god, *and* as alien from
the law and the prophets. It is certain, also, that with this view <span
id="fr_3620"></span>[3621](#fn_3620.md) he has erased everything that was
contrary to his own opinion and made for the Creator, as if it had been
interpolated by His advocates, whilst everything which agreed with his
own opinion he has retained. The latter statements we shall strictly
examine; <span id="fr_3621"></span>[3622](#fn_3621.md) and if they shall
turn out rather for our side, and shatter the assumption of Marcion, we
shall embrace them. It will then become evident, that in retaining them
he has shown no less of the defect of blindness, which characterizes
heresy, than he displayed when he erased all the former class of
subjects. Such, then, is to be <span
id="fr_3622"></span>[3623](#fn_3622.md) the drift and form of my little
treatise; subject, of course, to whatever condition may have become
requisite on both sides of the question. <span
id="fr_3623"></span>[3624](#fn_3623.md) Marcion has laid down the position,
that Christ who in the days of Tiberius was, by a previously unknown
god, revealed for the salvation of all nations, is a different being
from Him who was ordained by God the Creator for the restoration of the
Jewish state, and who is yet to come. Between these he interposes the
separation of <span id="fr_3624"></span>[3625](#fn_3624.md) a great and
absolute difference—as great as lies between what is just and what is
good; <span id="fr_3625"></span>[3626](#fn_3625.md) as great as lies
between the law and the gospel; as great, (in short,) as is the
difference between Judaism and Christianity. Hence will arise also our
rule, <span id="fr_3626"></span>[3627](#fn_3626.md) by which we
determine <span id="fr_3627"></span>[3628](#fn_3627.md) that there ought to
be nothing in common between the Christ of the rival god and the
Creator; but that (Christ) must be pronounced to belong to the
Creator, <span id="fr_3628"></span>[3629](#fn_3628.md) if He has
administered His dispensations, fulfilled His prophecies, promoted <span
id="fr_3629"></span>[3630](#fn_3629.md) His laws, given reality to <span
id="fr_3630"></span>[3631](#fn_3630.md) His promises, revived His mighty
power, <span id="fr_3631"></span>[3632](#fn_3631.md) remoulded His
determinations, <span id="fr_3632"></span>[3633](#fn_3632.md) expressed His
attributes, His properties.  This law and this rule I earnestly request
the reader to have ever in his mind, and so let him begin to investigate
whether Christ be Marcion’s or the Creator’s.
