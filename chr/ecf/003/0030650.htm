<p class="c30"><a name="v.ix.iii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="v.ix.iii-p1.1"></A>Chapter III.&#8212;Sundry Popular Fears and Prejudices. The Doctrine of the Trinity in Unity Rescued from These Misapprehensions.</span></p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="v.ix.iii-p2"></A>The simple, indeed, (I will not call them unwise and unlearned,) who always constitute <A NAME="page_599"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 599</FONT></A> <a name="v.ix.iii-Page_599"></A>the majority of believers, are startled at the dispensation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7789"></A><A HREF="#fn_7789"><FONT SIZE="1">7790</FONT></A>
 (of the Three in One), on the ground that their very rule of faith withdraws them from the world&#146;s plurality of gods to the one only true God; not understanding that, although He is the one only God, He must yet be believed in with His own <span class="Greek"><a name="v.ix.iii-p3.2"></A>&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#8055;&#945;</span> . The numerical order and distribution of the Trinity they assume to be a division of the Unity; whereas the Unity which derives the Trinity out of its own self is so far from being destroyed, that it is actually supported by it. They are constantly throwing out against us that we are preachers of two gods and three gods, while they take to themselves pre-eminently the credit of being worshippers of the One God; just as if the Unity itself with irrational deductions did not produce heresy, and the Trinity rationally considered constitute the truth. We, say they, maintain the <i>Monarchy</i> (or, <i>sole government</i> of God).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7790"></A><A HREF="#fn_7790"><FONT SIZE="1">7791</FONT></A>
 And so, as far as the sound goes, do even Latins (and ignorant ones too) pronounce the word in such a way that you would suppose their understanding of the <span class="Greek"><a name="v.ix.iii-p4.1"></A>&#956;&#959;&#957;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#8055;&#945; (</span>or <i>Monarchy</i>) was as complete as their pronunciation of the term. Well, then Latins take pains to pronounce the <span class="Greek"><a name="v.ix.iii-p4.2"></A>&#956;&#959;&#957;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#8055;&#945;</span> (or <i>Monarchy</i>), while Greeks actually refuse to understand the <span class="Greek"><a name="v.ix.iii-p4.3"></A>&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#8055;&#945;</span>, or <i>Dispensation</i> (<i>of the Three in One</i>). As for myself, however, if I have gleaned any knowledge of either language, I am sure that <span class="Greek"><a name="v.ix.iii-p4.4"></A>&#956;&#959;&#957;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#8055;&#945;</span> (or <i>Monarchy</i>) has no other meaning than single and individual&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7791"></A><A HREF="#fn_7791"><FONT SIZE="1">7792</FONT></A>
 rule; but for all that, this monarchy does not, because it is the government of one, preclude him whose government it is, either from having a son, or from having made himself actually a son to himself,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7792"></A><A HREF="#fn_7792"><FONT SIZE="1">7793</FONT></A>
 or from ministering his own monarchy by whatever agents he will. Nay more, I contend that no dominion so belongs to one only, as his own, or is in such a sense singular, or is in such a sense a monarchy, as not also to be administered through other persons most closely connected with it, and whom it has itself provided as officials to itself. If, moreover, there be a son belonging to him whose monarchy it is, it does not forthwith become divided and cease to be a monarchy, if the son also be taken as a sharer in it; but it is as to its origin equally his, by whom it is communicated to the son; and being his, it is quite as much a monarchy (or <i>sole empire</i>), since it is held together by two who are so inseparable.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7793"></A><A HREF="#fn_7793"><FONT SIZE="1">7794</FONT></A>
 Therefore, inasmuch as the Divine Monarchy also is administered by so many legions and hosts of angels, according as it is written, &#8220;Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7794"></A><A HREF="#fn_7794"><FONT SIZE="1">7795</FONT></A>
 and since it has not from this circumstance ceased to be the rule of one (so as no longer to be a monarchy), because it is administered by so many thousands of powers; how comes it to pass that God should be thought to suffer division and severance in the Son and in the Holy Ghost, who have the second and the third places assigned to them, and who are so closely joined with the Father in His substance, when He suffers no such (division and severance) in the multitude of so many angels? Do you really suppose that Those, who are naturally members of the Father&#146;s own substance, pledges of His love,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7795"></A><A HREF="#fn_7795"><FONT SIZE="1">7796</FONT></A>
 instruments of His might, nay, His power itself and the entire system of His monarchy, are the overthrow and destruction thereof? You are not right in so thinking. I prefer your exercising yourself on the meaning of the thing rather than on the sound of the word. Now you must understand the overthrow of a monarchy to be <i>this</i>, when another dominion, which has a framework and a state peculiar to itself (and is therefore a rival), is brought in over and above it: when, <i>e.g.</i>, some other god is introduced in opposition to the Creator, as in the opinions of Marcion; or when many gods are introduced, according to your Valentinuses and your Prodicuses. Then it amounts to an overthrow of the Monarchy, since it involves the destruction of the Creator.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7796"></A><A HREF="#fn_7796"><FONT SIZE="1">7797</FONT></A>
