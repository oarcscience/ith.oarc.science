<span id="iv.v.v-p2"></span>In the matter of their origins, as these are
somewhat obscure and but little known to many among us, our
investigations must go back to a remote antiquity, and our authorities
be none other than books of heathen literature.  Various authors are
extant who have published works on the subject. The origin of the games
as given by them is this. Timæus tells us that immigrants from Asia,
under the leadership of Tyrrhenus, who, in a contest about his native
kingdom, had succumbed to his brother, settled down in Etruria. Well,
among other superstitious observances under the name of religion, they
set up in their new home public shows. The Romans, at their own request,
obtain from them skilled performers—the proper seasons—the name too, for
it is said they are called *Ludi*, from *Lydi*. And though Varro derives
the name of *Ludi* from *Ludus*, that is, from play, as they called the
Luperci also *Ludii*, because they ran about making sport; still that
sporting of young men belongs, in his view, to festal days and temples,
and objects of religious veneration. However, it is of little
consequence the origin of the name, when it is certain that the thing
springs from idolatry. The Liberalia, under the general designation of
Ludi, clearly declared the glory of Father Bacchus; for to Bacchus these
festivities were first consecrated by grateful peasants, in return for
the boon he conferred on them, as they say, making known the pleasures
of wine. <span id="page_82">p. 82</span> <span
id="iv.v.v-Page_82"></span>Then the Consualia were called *Ludi*, and at
first were in honour of Neptune, for Neptune has the name of Consus
also. Thereafter Romulus dedicated the Equiria to Mars, though they
claim the Consualia too for Romulus, on the ground that he consecrated
them to Consus, the god, as they will have it, of counsel; of the
counsel, forsooth, in which he planned the rape of the Sabine virgins
for wives to his soldiers. An excellent counsel truly; and still I
suppose reckoned just and righteous by the Romans themselves, I may not
say by God. This goes also to taint the origin: you cannot surely hold
that to be good which has sprung from sin, from shamelessness, from
violence, from hatred, from a fratricidal founder, from a son of Mars.
Even now, at the first turning-post in the circus, there is a
subterranean altar to this same Consus, with an inscription to this
effect:  “Consus, great in counsel, Mars, in battle mighty tutelar
deities.” The priests of the state sacrifice at it on the nones of July;
the priest of Romulus and the Vestals on the twelfth before the Kalends
of September. In addition to this, Romulus instituted games in honor of
Jupiter Feretrius on the Tarpeian Hill, according to the statement Piso
has handed down to us, called both Tarpeian and Capitoline. After him
Numa Pompilius instituted games to Mars and Robigo (for they have also
invented a goddess of rust); then Tullus Hostilius; then Ancus Martius;
and various others in succession did the like. As to the idols in whose
honour these games were established, ample information is to be found in
the pages of Suetonius Tranquillus.  But we need say no more to prove
the accusation of idolatrous origin.
