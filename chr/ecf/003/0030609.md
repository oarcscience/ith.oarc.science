<span id="v.viii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Certain Metaphorical Terms
Explained of the Resurrection of the Flesh.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxvii-p2"></span>We have also in the Scriptures *robes*
mentioned as allegorizing the hope of the flesh. Thus in the Revelation
of John it is said:  “These are they which have not defiled their
clothes with women,” <span id="fr_7472"></span>[7473](#fn_7472)
—indicating, of course, virgins, and such as have become “eunuchs for
the kingdom of heaven’s sake.” <span
id="fr_7473"></span>[7474](#fn_7473) Therefore they shall be “clothed in
white rai<span id="page_565">p. 565</span> <span
id="v.viii.xxvii-Page_565"></span>ment,” <span
id="fr_7474"></span>[7475](#fn_7474) that is, in the bright beauty of
the unwedded flesh. In the gospel even, “the wedding garment” may be
regarded as the sanctity of the flesh. <span
id="fr_7475"></span>[7476](#fn_7475) And so, when Isaiah tells us what
sort of “fast the Lord hath chosen,” and subjoins a statement about the
reward of good works, he says: “Then shall thy light break forth as the
morning, and thy garments, <span id="fr_7476"></span>[7477](#fn_7476)
shall speedily arise;” <span id="fr_7477"></span>[7478](#fn_7477) where
he has no thought of cloaks or stuff gowns, but means the rising of the
flesh, which he declared the resurrection of, after its fall in death.
Thus we are furnished even with an allegorical defence of the
resurrection of the body. When, then, we read, “Go, my people, enter
into your closets for a little season, until my anger pass away,” <span
id="fr_7478"></span>[7479](#fn_7478) we have in the closets graves, in
which they will have to rest for a little while, who shall have at the
end of the world departed this life in the last furious onset of the
power of Antichrist.  Why else did He use the expression *closets*, in
preference to some other receptacle, if it were not that the flesh is
kept in these closets or cellars salted and reserved for use, to be
drawn out thence on a suitable occasion? It is on a like principle that
embalmed corpses are set aside for burial in mausoleums and sepulchres,
in order that they may be removed therefrom when the Master shall order
it. Since, therefore, there is consistency in thus understanding the
passage (for what refuge of little closets could possibly shelter us
from the wrath of God?), *it appears that* by the very phrase which he
uses, “Until His anger pass away,” <span
id="fr_7479"></span>[7480](#fn_7479) which shall extinguish Antichrist,
he in fact shows that after that indignation the flesh will come forth
from the sepulchre, in which it had been deposited previous to the
*bursting out of the* anger. Now out of the closets nothing else is
brought than that which had been put into them, and after the
extirpation of Antichrist shall be busily transacted *the great process
of* the resurrection.
