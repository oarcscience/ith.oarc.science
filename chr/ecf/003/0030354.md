<span id="v.iv.iii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Another Cavil Met, I.e., the
Devil Who Instigated Man to Sin Himself the Creature of God. Nay, the
Primeval Cherub Only Was God’s Work. The Devilish Nature Superadded by
Wilfulness. In Man’s Recovery the Devil is Vanquished in a Conflict on
His Own Ground.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.x-p2"></span>If, however, you choose to transfer the
account <span id="fr_2830"></span>[2831](#fn_2830) of evil from man to
the devil as the instigator of sin, and in this way, too, throw the
blame on the Creator, inasmuch as He created the devil,—for He maketh
those spiritual beings, the angels—then it will follow that <span
id="fr_2831"></span>[2832](#fn_2831) what was made, that is to say, the
angel, will belong to Him who made it; while that which was not made by
God, even the devil, or accuser, <span
id="fr_2832"></span>[2833](#fn_2832) cannot but have been made by
itself; and this by false detraction <span
id="fr_2833"></span>[2834](#fn_2833) from God: first, how that God had
forbidden them to eat of every tree; then, with the pretence that they
should not die if they ate; thirdly, as if God grudged them the property
of divinity. Now, whence originated this malice of lying and deceit
towards man, and slandering of God? Most certainly not from God, who
made the angel good after the fashion of His good works.  Indeed, before
he became the devil, he stands forth the wisest of creatures; and <span
id="fr_2834"></span>[2835](#fn_2834) wisdom is no <span
id="fr_2835"></span>[2836](#fn_2835) evil. If you turn to the prophecy
of Ezekiel, you will at once perceive that this angel was both by
creation good and by choice corrupt. For in the person of the prince of
Tyre it is said in reference to the devil: “Moreover, the word of the
Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the
king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God: Thou sealest
up the sum, full of wisdom, perfect in beauty” (this belongs to him as
the highest of the angels, the archangel, the wisest of all); “amidst
the delights of the paradise of thy God wast thou born” (for it was
there, where God had made the angels in a shape which resembled the
figure of animals). “Every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius,
the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the
sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle; and with gold hast thou filled
thy barns and thy treasuries. From the day when thou wast created, when
I set thee, a cherub, upon the holy mountain of God, thou wast in the
midst of stones of fire, thou wast irreproachable in thy days, from the
day of thy creation, until thine iniquities were discovered. By the
abundance of thy <span id="page_306">p. 306</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.x-Page_306"></span>merchandise thou hast filled thy
storehouses, and thou hast sinned,” etc. <span
id="fr_2836"></span>[2837](#fn_2836) This description, it is manifest,
properly belongs to the transgression of the angel, and not to the
prince’s: for none among human beings was either born in the paradise of
God, not even Adam himself, who was rather translated thither; nor
placed with a cherub upon God’s holy mountain, that is to say, in the
heights of heaven, from which the Lord testifies that Satan fell; nor
detained amongst the stones of fire, and the flashing rays of burning
constellations, whence Satan was cast down like lightning. <span
id="fr_2837"></span>[2838](#fn_2837) No, it is none else than the very
author of sin who was denoted in the person of a sinful man: he was once
irreproachable, at the time of his creation, formed for good by God, as
by the good Creator of irreproachable creatures, and adorned with every
angelic glory, and associated with God, good with the Good; but
afterwards of his own accord removed to evil. *From the day when thine
iniquities*, <span id="fr_2838"></span>[2839](#fn_2838) says he, *were
discovered*,—attributing to him those injuries wherewith he injured man
when he was expelled from his allegiance to God,—even from that time did
he sin, when he propagated his sin, and thereby plied “the abundance of
his merchandise,” that is, of his Wickedness, even the tale <span
id="fr_2839"></span>[2840](#fn_2839) of his transgressions, because he
was himself as a spirit no less (than man) created, with the faculty of
free-will.  For God would in nothing fail to endow a being who was to be
next to Himself with a liberty of this kind.  Nevertheless, by
precondemning him, God testified that he had departed from the
condition <span id="fr_2840"></span>[2841](#fn_2840) of his created
nature, through his own lusting after the wickedness which was
spontaneously conceived within him; and at the same time, by conceding a
permission for the operation of his designs, He acted consistently with
the purpose of His own goodness, deferring the devil’s destruction for
the self-same reason as He postponed the restitution of man. For He
afforded room for a conflict, wherein man might crush his enemy with the
same freedom of his will as had made him succumb to him (proving that
the fault was all his own, not God’s), and so worthily recover his
salvation by a victory; wherein also the devil might receive a more
bitter punishment, through being vanquished by him whom he had
previously injured; and wherein God might be discovered to be so much
the more good, as waiting <span id="fr_2841"></span>[2842](#fn_2841) for
man to return from his present life to a more glorious paradise, with a
right to pluck of the tree of life. <span
