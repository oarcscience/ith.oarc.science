<span id="v.iv.vi.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—On the Epistle to the Galatians.
The Abolition of the Ordinances of the Mosaic Law No Proof of Another
God. The Divine Lawgiver, the Creator Himself, Was the Abrogator. The
Apostle’s Doctrine in the First Chapter Shown to Accord with the
Teaching of the Old Testament. The Acts of the Apostles Shown to Be
Genuine Against Marcion. This Book Agrees with the Pauline
Epistles.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.ii-p2"></span>The epistle which we also allow to be
the most decisive <span id="fr_5235"></span>[5236](#fn_5235.md) against
Judaism, is that wherein the apostle instructs the Galatians. For the
abolition of the ancient law we fully admit, and hold that it actually
proceeds from the dispensation of the Creator,—a point which we have
already often treated in the course of our discussion, when we showed
that the innovation was foretold by the prophets of our God. <span
id="fr_5236"></span>[5237](#fn_5236.md) Now, if the Creator indeed promised
that “the ancient things should pass away,” <span
id="fr_5237"></span>[5238](#fn_5237.md) to be superseded by a new course of
things which should arise, whilst Christ marks the period of the
separation when He says, “The law and the prophets were until
John” <span id="fr_5238"></span>[5239](#fn_5238.md) —thus making the
Baptist the limit between the two dispensations of the old things then
terminating—and the new things then beginning, the apostle cannot of
course do otherwise, (coming as he does) in Christ, who was revealed
after John, than invalidate “the old things” and confirm “the new,” and
yet promote thereby the faith of no other god than the Creator, at whose
instance <span id="fr_5239"></span>[5240](#fn_5239.md) it was foretold that
the ancient things should pass away. Therefore both the abrogation of
the law and the establishment of the gospel help my argument even in
this epistle, wherein they both have reference to the fond assumption of
the Galatians, which led them to suppose that faith in Christ (the
Creator’s Christ, of course) was obligatory, but without annulling the
law, because it still appeared to them a thing incredible that the law
should be set aside by its own author. Again, <span
id="fr_5240"></span>[5241](#fn_5240.md) if they had at all heard of any
other god from the apostle, would they not have concluded at once, of
themselves, that they must give up the law of that God whom they had
left, in order to follow another?  For what man would be long in
learning, that he ought to pursue a new discipline, after he had taken
up with a new god? Since, however, <span
id="fr_5241"></span>[5242](#fn_5241.md) the same God was declared in the
gospel which had always been so well known in the law, the only change
being in the dispensation, <span id="fr_5242"></span>[5243](#fn_5242.md)
the sole point of the question to be discussed was, whether the law of
the Creator ought by the gospel to be excluded in the Christ of the
Creator? Take away this point, and the controversy falls to the ground.
Now, since they would all know of themselves, <span
id="fr_5243"></span>[5244](#fn_5243.md) on the withdrawal of this point,
that they must of course renounce all submission to the Creator by
reason of their <span id="page_432">p. 432</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.ii-Page_432"></span>faith in another god, there could have
been no call for the apostle to teach them so earnestly that which their
own belief must have spontaneously suggested to them. Therefore the
entire purport of this epistle is simply to show us that the
supersession <span id="fr_5244"></span>[5245](#fn_5244.md) of the law comes
from the appointment of the Creator—a point, which we shall still have
to keep in mind. <span id="fr_5245"></span>[5246](#fn_5245.md) Since also
he makes mention of no other god (and he could have found no other
opportunity of doing so, more suitable than when his purpose was to set
forth the reason for the abolition of the law—especially as the
prescription of a new god would have afforded a singularly good and most
sufficient reason), it is clear enough in what sense he writes, “I
marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him who hath called you to His
grace to *another* gospel” <span id="fr_5246"></span>[5247](#fn_5246.md)
—He means) “another” as to the conduct it prescribes, not in respect of
its worship; “another” as to the discipline it teaches, not in respect
of its divinity; because it is the office of <span
id="fr_5247"></span>[5248](#fn_5247.md) Christ’s gospel to call men from
the law to grace, not from the Creator to another god. For nobody had
induced them to apostatize from <span
id="fr_5248"></span>[5249](#fn_5248.md) the Creator, that they should seem
to “be removed to another gospel,” simply when they return again to the
Creator.  When he adds, too, the words, “which is not another,” <span
id="fr_5249"></span>[5250](#fn_5249.md) he confirms the fact that the
gospel which he maintains is the Creator’s. For the Creator Himself
promises the gospel, when He says by Isaiah: “Get thee up into the high
mountain, thou that bringest to Sion good tidings; lift up thy voice
with strength, thou that bringest the gospel to Jerusalem.” <span
id="fr_5250"></span>[5251](#fn_5250.md) Also when, with respect to the
apostles personally, He says, “How beautiful are the feet of them that
preach the gospel of peace, that bring good tidings of good” <span
id="fr_5251"></span>[5252](#fn_5251.md) —even proclaiming the gospel to the
Gentiles, because He also says, “In His name shall the Gentiles
trust;” <span id="fr_5252"></span>[5253](#fn_5252.md) that is, in the name
of Christ, to whom He says, “I have given thee as a light of the
Gentiles.” <span id="fr_5253"></span>[5254](#fn_5253.md) However, you will
have it that it is the gospel of a new god which was then set forth by
the apostle. So that there are two gospels for <span
id="fr_5254"></span>[5255](#fn_5254.md) two gods; and the apostle made a
great mistake when he said that “there is not another” gospel, <span
id="fr_5255"></span>[5256](#fn_5255.md) since there is (on the
hypothesis) <span id="fr_5256"></span>[5257](#fn_5256.md) another; and so
he might have made a better defence of his gospel, by rather
demonstrating this, than by insisting on its being but one. But perhaps,
to avoid this difficulty, you will say that he therefore added just
afterwards, “Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel, let
him be accursed,” <span id="fr_5257"></span>[5258](#fn_5257.md) because he
was aware that the Creator was going to introduce a gospel! But you thus
entangle yourself still more. For this is now the mesh in which you are
caught. To affirm that there are two gospels, is not the part of a man
who has already denied that there is another. His meaning, however, is
clear, for he has mentioned himself first (in the anathema): “But though
*we* or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel.” <span
id="fr_5258"></span>[5259](#fn_5258.md) It is by way of an example that he
has expressed himself. If even he himself might not preach any other
gospel, then neither might an angel. He said “angel” in this way, that
he might show how much more men ought not to be believed, when neither
an angel nor an apostle ought to be; not that he meant to apply <span
id="fr_5259"></span>[5260](#fn_5259.md) an angel to the gospel of the
Creator.  He then cursorily touches on his own conversion from a
persecutor to an apostle—confirming thereby the Acts of the
Apostles, <span id="fr_5260"></span>[5261](#fn_5260.md) in which book may
be found the very subject <span id="fr_5261"></span>[5262](#fn_5261.md) of
this epistle, how that certain persons interposed, and said that men
ought to be circumcised, and that the law of Moses was to be observed;
and how the apostles, when consulted, determined, by the authority of
the Holy Ghost, that “a yoke should not be put upon men’s necks which
their fathers even had not been able to bear.” <span
id="fr_5262"></span>[5263](#fn_5262.md) Now, since the Acts of the Apostles
thus agree with Paul, it becomes apparent why you reject them. It is
because they declare no other God than the Creator, and prove Christ to
belong to no other God than the Creator; whilst the promise of the Holy
Ghost is shown to have been fulfilled in no other document than the Acts
of the Apostles.  Now, it is not very likely that these <span
id="fr_5263"></span>[5264](#fn_5263.md) should be found in agreement with
the apostle, on the one hand, when they described his career in
accordance with his own statement; but should, on the other hand, be at
variance with him when they announce the (attribute of) divinity in the
Creator’s Christ—as if Paul <span id="page_433">p. 433</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.ii-Page_433"></span>did not follow <span
id="fr_5264"></span>[5265](#fn_5264.md) the preaching of the apostles when
he received from them the prescription <span
id="fr_5265"></span>[5266](#fn_5265.md) of not teaching the Law. <span
id="fr_5266"></span>[5267](#fn_5266.md)

important, St. Matthew has adopted it; see [Matt.
