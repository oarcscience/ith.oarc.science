<span id="v.iv.vi.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The First Epistle to the
Thessalonians. The Shorter Epistles Pungent in Sense and Very Valuable.
St. Paul Upbraids the Jews for the Death First of Their Prophets and
Then of Christ.  This a Presumption that Both Christ and the Prophets
Pertained to the Same God. The Law of Nature, Which is in Fact the
Creator’s Discipline, and the Gospel of Christ Both Enjoin Chastity. The
Resurrection Provided for in the Old Testament by Christ. Man’s Compound
Nature.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.xv-p2"></span>I shall not be sorry to bestow attention
on the shorter epistles also.  Even in brief works there is much
pungency. <span id="fr_5891"></span>[5892](#fn_5891.md) The Jews had slain
their prophets. <span id="fr_5892"></span>[5893](#fn_5892.md) I may ask,
What has this to do with the apostle of the rival god, one so amiable
withal, who could hardly be said to condemn even the failings of his own
people; and who, moreover, has himself some hand in making away with the
same prophets <span id="page_462">p. 462</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xv-Page_462"></span>whom he is destroying? What injury did
Israel commit against him in slaying those whom he too has reprobated,
since he was the first to pass a hostile sentence on them? But *Israel*
sinned against their own God. He upbraided their iniquity to whom the
injured *God* pertains; and certainly he is anything but the adversary
of the injured *Deity*. Else he would not have burdened them with the
charge of killing even the Lord, in the words, “Who both killed the Lord
*Jesus* and their own prophets,” although (the pronoun) *their own* be
an addition of the heretics. <span id="fr_5893"></span>[5894](#fn_5893.md)
Now, what was there so very acrimonious <span
id="fr_5894"></span>[5895](#fn_5894.md) in their killing Christ the
proclaimer of the new god, after they had put to death also the prophets
of their own god?  The fact, however, of their having slain the Lord and
His servants, is put as a case of climax. <span
id="fr_5895"></span>[5896](#fn_5895.md) Now, if it were the Christ of one
god and the prophets of another god whom they slew, he would certainly
have placed the impious crimes on the same level, instead of mentioning
them in the way of a climax; but they did not admit of being put on the
same level: the climax, therefore, was only possible <span
id="fr_5896"></span>[5897](#fn_5896.md) by the sin having been in fact
committed against one and the same Lord in the two respective
circumstances. <span id="fr_5897"></span>[5898](#fn_5897.md) To one and the
same Lord, then, belonged Christ and the prophets. What that
“sanctification of ours” is, which he declares to be “the will of God,”
you may discover from the opposite conduct which he forbids. That we
should “abstain from fornication,” not from marriage; that every one
“should know how to possess his vessel in honour.” <span
id="fr_5898"></span>[5899](#fn_5898.md) In what way?  “Not in the lust of
concupiscence, even as the Gentiles.” <span
id="fr_5899"></span>[5900](#fn_5899.md) Concupiscence, however, is not
ascribed to marriage even among the Gentiles, but to extravagant,
unnatural, and enormous sins. <span id="fr_5900"></span>[5901](#fn_5900.md)
The law of nature <span id="fr_5901"></span>[5902](#fn_5901.md) is opposed
to luxury as well as to grossness and uncleanness; <span
id="fr_5902"></span>[5903](#fn_5902.md) it does not forbid connubial
intercourse, but concupiscence; and it takes care of <span
id="fr_5903"></span>[5904](#fn_5903.md) our vessel by the honourable estate
of matrimony. This passage (of the apostle) I would treat in such a way
as to maintain the superiority of the other and higher sanctity,
preferring continence and virginity to marriage, but by no means
prohibiting the latter. For my hostility is directed against <span
id="fr_5904"></span>[5905](#fn_5904.md) those who are for destroying the
God of marriage, not those who follow after chastity. He says that those
who “remain unto the coming of Christ,” along with “the dead in Christ,
shall rise first,” being “caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in
the air.” <span id="fr_5905"></span>[5906](#fn_5905.md) I find it was in
their foresight of all this, that the heavenly intelligences gazed with
admiration on “the Jerusalem which is above,” <span
id="fr_5906"></span>[5907](#fn_5906.md) and by the mouth of Isaiah said
long ago:  “Who are these that fly as clouds, and as doves with their
young ones, unto me?” <span id="fr_5907"></span>[5908](#fn_5907.md) Now, as
Christ has prepared for us this ascension into heaven, He must be the
Christ of whom Amos <span id="fr_5908"></span>[5909](#fn_5908.md) spoke:
“It is He who builds His ascent up to the heavens,” <span
id="fr_5909"></span>[5910](#fn_5909.md) even for Himself and His people.
Now, from whom shall I expect (the fulfilment of) all this, except from
Him whom I have heard give the promise thereof?  What “spirit” does he
forbid us to “quench,” and what “prophesyings” to “despise?” <span
id="fr_5910"></span>[5911](#fn_5910.md) Not the Creator’s spirit, nor the
Creator’s prophesyings, Marcion of course replies.  For *he* has already
quenched and despised the thing which he destroys, and is unable to
forbid what he has despised. <span id="fr_5911"></span>[5912](#fn_5911.md)
It is then incumbent on Marcion now to display in his church that spirit
of his god which must not be quenched, and the prophesyings which must
not be despised.  And since he has made such a display as he thinks fit,
let him know that we shall challenge it whatever it may be to the
rule <span id="fr_5912"></span>[5913](#fn_5912.md) of the grace and power
of the Spirit and the prophets—namely, to foretell the future, to reveal
the secrets of the heart, and to explain mysteries. And when he shall
have failed to produce and give proof of any such criterion, we will
then on our side bring out both the Spirit and the prophecies of the
Creator, which utter predictions according to His will. Thus it will be
clearly seen of what the apostle spoke, even of those things which were
to happen in the church of his God; and as long as He endures, so long
also does His Spirit work, and so long are His promises repeated. <span
id="fr_5913"></span>[5914](#fn_5913.md) Come now, you who deny the
salvation of the flesh, and who, whenever there occurs the specific
mention of *body* in a case of this sort, <span
id="fr_5914"></span>[5915](#fn_5914.md) interpret it as meaning <span
id="page_463">p. 463</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xv-Page_463"></span>anything rather than the substance of
the flesh, (tell me) how is it that the apostle has given certain
distinct names to all (our faculties), and has comprised them all in one
prayer for their safety, desiring that our “spirit and soul and body may
be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord and Saviour (Jesus)
Christ?” <span id="fr_5915"></span>[5916](#fn_5915.md) Now he has here
propounded the soul and the body as two several and distinct
things. <span id="fr_5916"></span>[5917](#fn_5916.md) For although the soul
has a kind of body of a quality of its own, <span
id="fr_5917"></span>[5918](#fn_5917.md) just as the spirit has, yet as the
soul and the body are distinctly named, the soul has its own peculiar
appellation, not requiring the common designation of *body*.  This is
left for “the flesh,” which having no proper name (in this passage),
necessarily makes use of the common designation. Indeed, I see no other
substance in man, after *spirit* and *soul*, to which the term *body*
can be applied except “the flesh.” This, therefore, I understand to be
meant by the word “body”—as often as the latter is not specifically
named. Much more do I so understand it in the present passage, where the
flesh <span id="fr_5918"></span>[5919](#fn_5918.md) is expressly called by
the name “body.”

<span id="v.iv.vi.xv-p3"></span> Sapor. We have here a characteristic
touch of his diligent and also intrepid spirit.  Epiphanius says this
short epistle “was so entirely corrupted by Marcion, that he had himself
selected nothing from it whereon to found any refutations of him or of
his doctrine.”  Tertullian, however, was of a different mind; for he has
made it evident, that though there were alterations made by Marcion, yet
sufficient was left untouched by him to show the absurdity of his
opinions. Epiphanius and Tertullian entertained, respectively, similar
opinions of Marcion’s treatment of the second epistle, which the latter
discusses in the next chapter (Larder).

<span id="v.iv.vi.xv-p28"></span> It is remarkable that our author
quotes this text of the *three* principles, in defence only of *two* of
them. But he was strongly opposed to the idea of any absolute division
between the *soul* and the *spirit*. A distinction between these united
parts, he might, under limitations, have admitted; but all idea of an
actual separation and *division* he opposed and denied. See his *De
Anima*, cap. x. St. Augustine more fully still maintained a similar
opinion. See also *his* *De Anima*, iv. 32. Bp. Ellicott, in his
interesting sermon *On the Threefold Nature of Man*, has given these
references, and also a sketch of patristic opinion of this subject. The
early fathers, Justin Martyr, Clement of Alex., Origen, as well as
Didymus of Alex., Gregory Nyssen., and Basil, held distinctly the
threefold nature. Our own divines, as is natural, are also divided in
views. Bp. Bull, Hammond, and Jackson hold the *trichotomy*, as a triple
nature is called; others, like Bp. Butler, deny the possibility of
dividing our immaterial nature into two parts.  This variation of
opinion seems to have still representatives among our most recent
commentators: while Dean Alford holds the triplicity of our nature
literally with St. Paul, Archdeacon Wordsworth seems to agree with Bp.
Butler in regarding *soul* and *spirit* as component parts of one
principle. See also Bp. Ellicott’s *Destiny of the Creature*, sermon v.
and notes.

corporeal, see his treatise *De Anima*, v., and following chapters
