id="iv.x.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.</span>

<span id="iv.x.iii-p2"></span>But when we say that there are demons—as
though, in the simple fact that we alone expel them from the men’s
bodies, <span id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478.md) we did not also prove
their existence—some disciple of Chrysippus begins to curl the lip. Yet
thy curses sufficiently attest that there are such beings, and that they
are objects of thy strong dislike. <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479.md) As what comes to thee as a fit
expression of thy strong hatred of him, thou callest the man a dæmon who
annoys thee with his filthiness, <span id="page_177">p. 177</span> <span
id="iv.x.iii-Page_177"></span>or malice, or insolence, or any other vice
which we ascribe to evil spirits. In expressing vexation, contempt, or
abhorrence, thou hast Satan constantly upon thy lips; <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480.md) the very same we hold to be the
angel of evil, the source of error, the corrupter of the whole world, by
whom in the beginning man was entrapped into breaking the commandment of
God. And (the man) being given over to death on account of his sin, the
entire human race, tainted in their descent from him, were made a
channel for transmitting his condemnation. Thou seest, then, thy
destroyer; and though he is fully known only to Christians, or to
whatever sect <span id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481.md) confesses the
Lord, yet, even thou hast some acquaintance with him while yet thou
abhorrest him!
