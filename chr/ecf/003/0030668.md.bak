<span id="v.ix.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—In This and the Four Following
Chapters It is Shewn, by a Minute Analysis of St. John’s Gospel, that
the Father and Son are Constantly Spoken of as Distinct Persons.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xxi-p2"></span>Consider, therefore, how many passages
present their prescriptive authority to you in this very Gospel before
this inquiry of Philip, and previous to any discussion on your part. And
first of all there comes at once to hand the preamble of John to his
Gospel, which shows us what He previously was who had to become flesh. 
“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God. He was in the beginning with God: all things were made by Him,
and without Him was nothing made.” <span
id="fr_8008"></span>[8009](#fn_8008.md) Now, since these words may not be
taken otherwise than as they are written, there is without doubt shown
to be One who was from the beginning, and also One with whom He always
was: one the Word of God, the other God (although the Word is also God,
but *God* regarded as the Son of God, not as the Father); One through
whom were all things, Another by whom were all things.  But in what
sense we call Him *Another* we have already often described. In that we
called Him Another, we must needs imply that He is not identical—not
identical indeed, yet not as if separate; *Other* by dispensation, not
by division. He, therefore, *who* became flesh was not the very same as
He from whom the Word came.  “His glory was beheld—the glory as of the
only-begotten of the Father;” <span id="fr_8009"></span>[8010](#fn_8009.md)
not, (observe,) as of the Father. He “declared” (what was in) “the bosom
of the Father alone;” <span id="fr_8010"></span>[8011](#fn_8010.md) the
Father did not *divulge the secrets of* His own bosom. For this is
preceded by another statement: “No man hath seen God at any time.” <span
id="fr_8011"></span>[8012](#fn_8011.md) Then, again, when He is designated
by John (the Baptist) as “the Lamb of God,” <span
id="fr_8012"></span>[8013](#fn_8012.md) He is not *described as Himself the
same with Him* of whom He is the beloved *Son*. He is, no doubt, ever
the Son of God, but yet not He Himself of whom He is the Son.  This
(divine relationship) Nathanæl at once recognised in Him, <span
id="fr_8013"></span>[8014](#fn_8013.md) even as Peter did on another
occasion:  “Thou art the Son of God.” <span
id="fr_8014"></span>[8015](#fn_8014.md) And He affirmed Himself that they
were quite right in their convictions; for He answered Nathanæl:
“Because I said, I saw thee under the fig-tree, therefore dost thou
believe?” <span id="fr_8015"></span>[8016](#fn_8015.md) And in the same
manner He pronounced Peter to be “blessed,” inasmuch as “flesh and blood
had not revealed it to him”—that he had perceived the Father—“but the
Father which is in heaven.” <span id="fr_8016"></span>[8017](#fn_8016.md)
By asserting all this, He determined the distinction which is between
the two Persons:  that is, the Son then on earth, whom Peter had
confessed to be the Son of God; and the <span id="page_616">p.
616</span> <span id="v.ix.xxi-Page_616"></span>Father in heaven, who had
revealed to Peter the discovery which he had made, that Christ was the
Son of God.  When He entered the temple, He called it “His Father’s
house,” <span id="fr_8017"></span>[8018](#fn_8017.md) *speaking* as the
Son. In His address to Nicodemus He says: “So God loved the world, that
He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should
not perish, but have everlasting life.” <span
id="fr_8018"></span>[8019](#fn_8018.md) And again:  “For God sent not His
Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him
might be saved. He that believeth on Him is not condemned; but he that
believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the
name of the only-begotten Son of God.” <span
id="fr_8019"></span>[8020](#fn_8019) Moreover, when John (the Baptist.md)
was asked what he happened *to know* of Jesus, he said: “The Father
loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand. He that
believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not
the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.” <span
id="fr_8020"></span>[8021](#fn_8020.md) Whom, indeed, did He reveal to the
woman of Samaria? Was it not “the Messias which is called Christ?” <span
id="fr_8021"></span>[8022](#fn_8021.md) And so He showed, of course, that
He was not the Father, but the Son; and elsewhere He is expressly called
“the Christ, the Son of God,” <span id="fr_8022"></span>[8023](#fn_8022.md)
and not the Father. He says, therefore,” My meat is to do the will of
Him that sent me, and to finish His work;” <span
id="fr_8023"></span>[8024](#fn_8023.md) whilst to the Jews He remarks
respecting the cure of the impotent man, “My Father worketh hitherto,
and I work.” <span id="fr_8024"></span>[8025](#fn_8024.md) “My Father and
I”—these are the Son’s words. And it was on this very account that “the
Jews sought the more intently to kill Him, not only because He broke the
Sabbath, but also because He said that God was His Father, thus making
Himself equal with God. Then indeed did He answer and say unto them, The
Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do; for what
things soever He doeth these also doeth the Son likewise. For the Father
loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things that He Himself doeth; and He
will also show Him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.  For as
*the Father* raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son
also quickeneth whom He will. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath
committed all judgment unto the Son, that all men should honour the Son,
even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth
not the Father, who hath sent the Son. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
He that heareth my words, and believeth on Him that sent me, hath
everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed
from death unto life. Verily I say unto you, that the hour is coming,
when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and when they have
heard it, they shall live. For as the Father hath eternal life in
Himself, so also hath He given to the Son to have eternal life in
Himself; and He hath given Him authority to execute judgment also,
because He is the Son of man” <span id="fr_8025"></span>[8026](#fn_8025.md)
—that is, according to the flesh, even as He is also the Son of God
through His Spirit. <span id="fr_8026"></span>[8027](#fn_8026.md)
Afterwards He goes on to say: “But I have greater witness than that of
John; for the works which the Father hath given me to finish—those very
works bear witness of me that the Father hath sent me. And the Father
Himself, which hath sent me, hath also borne witness of me.” <span
id="fr_8027"></span>[8028](#fn_8027.md) But He at once adds, “Ye have
neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape;” <span
id="fr_8028"></span>[8029](#fn_8028.md) thus affirming that in former times
it was not the Father, but the Son, who used to be seen and heard. Then
He says at last: “I am come in my Father’s name, and ye have not
received me.” <span id="fr_8029"></span>[8030](#fn_8029.md) It was
therefore always the Son (of whom we read) under the designation of the
Almighty and Most High God, and King, and Lord. To those also who
inquired “what they should do *to work the works of God*,” <span
id="fr_8030"></span>[8031](#fn_8030.md) He answered, “*This is the work of
God*, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.” <span
id="fr_8031"></span>[8032](#fn_8031.md) He also declares Himself to be “the
bread which the Father sent from heaven;” <span
id="fr_8032"></span>[8033](#fn_8032.md) and adds, that “all that the Father
gave Him should come to Him, and that He Himself would not reject
them, <span id="fr_8033"></span>[8034](#fn_8033.md) because He had come
down from heaven not to do His own will, but the will of the Father; and
that the will of the Father was that every one who saw the Son, and
believed on Him, should obtain the life (everlasting,) and the
resurrection *at the last day*. No man indeed was able to come to Him,
except the Father attracted him; whereas every one who had heard and
learnt of the Father came to Him.” <span
id="fr_8034"></span>[8035](#fn_8034.md) He goes on then expressly to say,
“Not that any man hath seen the Father;” <span
id="fr_8035"></span>[8036](#fn_8035.md) thus showing us that it was through
the Word of the Father that <span id="page_617">p. 617</span> <span
id="v.ix.xxi-Page_617"></span>men were instructed and taught. Then, when
many departed from Him, <span id="fr_8036"></span>[8037](#fn_8036.md) and
He turned to the apostles with the inquiry whether “they also would go
away,” <span id="fr_8037"></span>[8038](#fn_8037.md) what was Simon Peter’s
answer? “To whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of *eternal* life, and
we believe that Thou art the Christ.” <span
id="fr_8038"></span>[8039](#fn_8038) (Tell me now, did they believe.md) Him
to be the Father, or the Christ of the Father?
