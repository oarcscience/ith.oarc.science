<span id="v.iv.v.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—The Same Conclusion Supported
by the Transfiguration. Marcion Inconsistent in Associating with Christ
in Glory Two Such Eminent Servants of the Creator as Moses and Elijah.
St. Peter’s Ignorance Accounted for on Montanist Principle.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxii-p2"></span>You ought to be very much ashamed of
<span id="page_383">p. 383</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxii-Page_383"></span>yourself on this account too, for
permitting him to appear on the retired mountain in the company of Moses
and Elias, <span id="fr_4318"></span>[4319](#fn_4318.md) whom he had come
to destroy. This, to be sure, <span id="fr_4319"></span>[4320](#fn_4319.md)
was what he wished to be understood as the meaning of that voice from
heaven: “This is my beloved Son, hear Him” <span
id="fr_4320"></span>[4321](#fn_4320.md) —*Him*, that is, not Moses or Elias
any longer. The voice alone, therefore, was enough, without the display
of Moses and Elias; for, by expressly mentioning whom they were to hear,
he must have forbidden all <span id="fr_4321"></span>[4322](#fn_4321.md)
others from being heard. Or else, did he mean that Isaiah and Jeremiah
and the others whom he did not exhibit were to be heard, since he
prohibited those whom he did display? Now, even if their presence was
necessary, they surely should not be represented as conversing together,
which is a sign of familiarity; nor as associated in glory with him, for
this indicates respect and graciousness; but they should be shown in
some slough <span id="fr_4322"></span>[4323](#fn_4322.md) as a sure token
of their ruin, or even in that darkness of the Creator which Christ was
sent to disperse, far removed from the glory of Him who was about to
sever their words and writings from His gospel.  This, then, is the
way <span id="fr_4323"></span>[4324](#fn_4323.md) how he demonstrates them
to be aliens, <span id="fr_4324"></span>[4325](#fn_4324.md) even by keeping
them in his own company!  This is how he shows they ought to be
relinquished: he associates them with himself instead! This is how he
destroys them: he irradiates them with his glory! How would their own
Christ act? I suppose He would have imitated the frowardness (of
heresy), <span id="fr_4325"></span>[4326](#fn_4325.md) and revealed them
just as Marcion’s Christ was bound to do, or at least as having with Him
any others rather than His own prophets! But what could so well befit
the Creator’s Christ, as to manifest Him in the company of His own
foreannouncers? <span id="fr_4326"></span>[4327](#fn_4326.md) —to let Him
be seen with those to whom He had appeared in revelations?—to let Him be
speaking with those who had spoken of Him?—to share His glory with those
by whom He used to be called the Lord of glory; even with those chief
servants of His, one of whom was once the moulder <span
id="fr_4327"></span>[4328](#fn_4327.md) of His people, the other afterwards
the reformer <span id="fr_4328"></span>[4329](#fn_4328.md) thereof; one the
initiator of the Old Testament, the other the consummator <span
id="fr_4329"></span>[4330](#fn_4329.md) of the New? Well therefore does
Peter, when recognizing the companions of his Christ in their
indissoluble connection with Him, suggest an expedient: “It is good for
us to be here” (good: that evidently means to be where Moses and Elias
are); “and let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for
Moses, and one for Elias. But he knew not what he said.” <span
id="fr_4330"></span>[4331](#fn_4330.md) How knew not?  Was his ignorance
the result of simple error? Or was it on the principle which we
maintain <span id="fr_4331"></span>[4332](#fn_4331.md) in the cause of the
new prophecy, <span id="fr_4332"></span>[4333](#fn_4332.md) that to grace
ecstasy or rapture <span id="fr_4333"></span>[4334](#fn_4333.md) is
incident. For when a man is rapt in the Spirit, especially when he
beholds the glory of God, or when God speaks through him, he necessarily
loses his sensation, <span id="fr_4334"></span>[4335](#fn_4334.md) because
he is overshadowed with the power of God,—a point concerning which there
is a question between us and the carnally-minded. <span
id="fr_4335"></span>[4336](#fn_4335.md) Now, it is no difficult matter to
prove the rapture <span id="fr_4336"></span>[4337](#fn_4336.md) of Peter.
For how could he have known Moses and Elias, except (by being) in the
Spirit? People could not have had their images, or statues, or
likenesses; for that the law forbade. How, if it were not that he had
seen them in the Spirit? And therefore, because it was in the Spirit
that he had now spoken, and not in his natural senses, he could not know
what he had said. But if, on the other hand, <span
id="fr_4337"></span>[4338](#fn_4337.md) he was thus ignorant, because he
erroneously supposed that (Jesus) was their Christ, it is then evident
that Peter, when previously asked by Christ, “Whom they thought Him to
be,” meant the Creator’s Christ, when he answered, “Thou art the
Christ;” because if he had been then aware that He belonged to the rival
god, he would not have made a mistake here. But if he was in error here
because of his previous erroneous opinion, <span
id="fr_4338"></span>[4339](#fn_4338.md) then you may be sure that up to
that very day no new divinity had been revealed by Christ, and that
Peter had so far made no mistake, because hitherto Christ had revealed
nothing of the kind; and that Christ accordingly was not to be regarded
as belonging to any other <span id="page_384">p. 384</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxii-Page_384"></span>than the Creator, whose entire
dispensation <span id="fr_4339"></span>[4340](#fn_4339.md) he, in fact,
here described. He selects from His disciples three witnesses of the
impending vision and voice. And this is just the way of the Creator. “In
the mouth of three witnesses,” says He, “shall every word be
established.” <span id="fr_4340"></span>[4341](#fn_4340.md) He withdraws to
a mountain. In the nature of the place I see much meaning. For the
Creator had originally formed His ancient people on a mountain both with
visible glory and His voice. It was only right that the New Testament
should be attested <span id="fr_4341"></span>[4342](#fn_4341.md) on such an
elevated spot <span id="fr_4342"></span>[4343](#fn_4342.md) as that whereon
the Old Testament had been composed; <span
id="fr_4343"></span>[4344](#fn_4343.md) under a like covering of cloud
also, which nobody will doubt, was condensed out of the Creator’s air.
Unless, indeed, he <span id="fr_4344"></span>[4345](#fn_4344.md) had
brought down his own clouds thither, because he had himself forced his
way through the Creator’s heaven; <span
id="fr_4345"></span>[4346](#fn_4345.md) or else it was only a precarious
cloud, <span id="fr_4346"></span>[4347](#fn_4346.md) as it were, of the
Creator which he used.  On the present (as also on the former) <span
id="fr_4347"></span>[4348](#fn_4347.md) occasion, therefore, the cloud was
not silent; but there was the accustomed voice from heaven, and the
Father’s testimony to the Son; precisely as in the first Psalm He had
said, “Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.” <span
id="fr_4348"></span>[4349](#fn_4348.md) By the mouth of Isaiah also He had
asked concerning Him, “Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him
hear the voice of His Son.” <span id="fr_4349"></span>[4350](#fn_4349.md)
When therefore He here presents Him with the words, “This is my
(beloved) Son,” this clause is of course understood, “whom I have
promised.” For if He once promised, and then afterwards says, “This is
He,” it is suitable conduct for one who accomplishes His purpose <span
id="fr_4350"></span>[4351](#fn_4350.md) that He should utter His voice in
proof of the promise which He had formerly made; but unsuitable in one
who is amenable to the retort, Can you, indeed, have a right to say,
“This is my son,” concerning whom you have given us no previous
information, <span id="fr_4351"></span>[4352](#fn_4351.md) any more than
you have favoured us with a revelation about your own prior existence?
“Hear ye Him,” therefore, whom from the beginning (the Creator) had
declared entitled to be heard in the name of a prophet, since it was as
a prophet that He had to be regarded by the people. “A prophet,” says
Moses, “shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your sons” (that
is, of course, after a carnal descent <span
id="fr_4352"></span>[4353](#fn_4352) .md); “unto Him shall ye hearken, as
unto me.” <span id="fr_4353"></span>[4354](#fn_4353.md) “Every one who will
not hearken unto Him, his soul <span
id="fr_4354"></span>[4355](#fn_4354.md) shall be cut off from amongst his
people.” <span id="fr_4355"></span>[4356](#fn_4355.md) So also Isaiah: “Who
is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His
Son.” <span id="fr_4356"></span>[4357](#fn_4356.md) This voice the Father
was going Himself to recommend. For, says he, <span
id="fr_4357"></span>[4358](#fn_4357.md) He establishes the words of His
Son, when He says, “This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.” Therefore,
even if there be made a transfer of the obedient “hearing” from Moses
and Elias to <span id="fr_4358"></span>[4359](#fn_4358.md) Christ, it is
still not from another God, or to another Christ; but from <span
id="fr_4359"></span>[4360](#fn_4359.md) the Creator to His Christ, in
consequence of the departure of the old covenant and the supervening of
the new. “Not an ambassador, nor an angel, but He Himself,” says Isaiah,
“shall save them;” <span id="fr_4360"></span>[4361](#fn_4360.md) for it is
He Himself who is now declaring and fulfilling the law and the prophets.
The Father gave to the Son new disciples, <span
id="fr_4361"></span>[4362](#fn_4361.md) after that Moses and Elias had been
exhibited along with Him in the honour of His glory, and had then been
dismissed as having fully discharged their duty and office, for the
express purpose of affirming for Marcion’s information the fact that
Moses and Elias had a share in even the glory of Christ. But we have the
entire structure <span id="fr_4362"></span>[4363](#fn_4362.md) of this same
vision in Habakkuk also, where the Spirit in the person of some <span
id="fr_4363"></span>[4364](#fn_4363.md) of the apostles says, “O Lord, I
have heard Thy speech, and was afraid.” What speech was this, other than
the words of the voice from heaven, This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him?
“I considered thy works, and was astonished.” When could this have
better happened than when Peter, on seeing His glory, knew not what he
was saying? “In the midst of the two Thou shalt be known”—even Moses and
<span id="page_385">p. 385</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxii-Page_385"></span>Elias. <span
id="fr_4364"></span>[4365](#fn_4364.md) These likewise did Zechariah see
under the figure of the two olive trees and olive branches. <span
id="fr_4365"></span>[4366](#fn_4365.md) For these are they of whom he says,
“They are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole
earth.” And again Habakkuk says, “His glory covered the heavens” (that
is, with that cloud), “and His splendour shall be like the light—even
the light, wherewith His very raiment glistened.” And if we would make
mention of <span id="fr_4366"></span>[4367](#fn_4366.md) the promise to
Moses, we shall find it accomplished here. For when Moses desired to see
the Lord, saying, “If therefore I have found grace in Thy sight,
manifest Thyself to me, that I may see Thee distinctly,” <span
id="fr_4367"></span>[4368](#fn_4367.md) the sight which he desired to have
was of that condition which he was to assume as man, and which as a
prophet he knew was to occur. Respecting the *face* of God, however, he
had already heard, “No man shall see me, and live.” “This thing,” said
He, “which thou hast spoken, will I do unto thee.”  Then Moses said,
“Show me Thy glory.”  And the Lord, with like reference to the future,
replied, “I will pass before thee in my glory,” etc. Then at the last He
says, “And then thou shalt see my back.” <span
id="fr_4368"></span>[4369](#fn_4368.md) Not loins, or calves of the legs,
did he want to behold, but the glory which was to be revealed in the
latter days. <span id="fr_4369"></span>[4370](#fn_4369.md) He had promised
that He would make Himself thus face to face visible to him, when He
said to Aaron, “If there shall be a prophet among you, I will make
myself known to him by vision, and by vision will I speak with him; but
not so is my manner to Moses; with *him* will I speak mouth to mouth,
even apparently” (that is to say, in the form of man which He was to
assume), “and not in dark speeches.” <span
id="fr_4370"></span>[4371](#fn_4370.md) Now, although Marcion has
denied <span id="fr_4371"></span>[4372](#fn_4371.md) that he is here
represented as speaking with the Lord, but only as standing, yet,
inasmuch as he stood “mouth to mouth,” he must also have stood “face to
face” *with him*, to use his words, <span
id="fr_4372"></span>[4373](#fn_4372.md) not far from him, in His very
glory—not to say, <span id="fr_4373"></span>[4374](#fn_4373.md) in His
presence. And with this glory he went away enlightened from Christ, just
as he used to do from the Creator; as *then* to dazzle the eyes of the
children of Israel, so *now* to smite those of the blinded Marcion, who
has failed to see how this argument also makes against him.

<span id="v.iv.v.xxii-p16"></span> This Tertullian seems to have done in
his treatise *De Ecstasi*, which is mentioned by St. Jerome—see his
*Catalogus Scriptt. Eccles.* (in Tertulliano); and by Nicephorus, *Hist.
Eccles.* iv. 22, 34.  On this subject of ecstasy, Tertullian has some
observations in *De Anima*, chap. xxi. and xlv. (Rigalt. and Oehler.)

<span id="v.iv.v.xxii-p20"></span> He calls those the carnally-minded
(“psychicos”) who thought that ecstatic raptures and revelations had
ceased in the church.  The term arises from a perverse application of [1
Cor. ii. 14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md)<span

Πνεύματος τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>. In opposition to the wild fanaticism of
Montanus, into which Tertullian strangely fell, the Catholics believed
that the true prophets, who were filled with the Spirit of God,
discharged their prophetic functions with a quiet and tranquil mind. See
the anonymous author, *Contra Cataphrygas*, in Eusebius, *Hist. Eccl*.
v. 17; Epiphanius, *Hæres*. 48. See also Routh, *Rell. Sacræ*, i. p.

<span id="v.iv.v.xxii-p42"></span> Tertullian, by introducing this
statement with an “*inquit*,” seems to make a quotation of it; but it is
only a comment on the actual quotations. Tertullian’s invariable object
in this argument is to match some event or word pertaining to the Christ
of the New Testament with some declaration of the Old Testament. In this
instance the approving words of God upon the mount are in [Heb. i.
5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md)<span id="v.iv.v.xxii-p42.1"></span>
applied to the Son, while in [Ps. ii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md)<span id="v.iv.v.xxii-p42.2"></span>
the Son applies them to Himself. Compare the *Adversus Praxean*, chap.
xix. (Fr. Junius and Oehler). It is, however, more likely that
Tertullian really means to quote [Isa. xliv.
26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026.md)<span
id="v.iv.v.xxii-p42.3"></span>, “that confirmeth the word of His
servant,” which Tertullian reads, “Sistens verba filii sui,” the
Septuagint being, <span class="Greek"><span
