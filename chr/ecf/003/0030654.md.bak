<span id="v.ix.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Son by Being Designated Word
and Wisdom, (According to the Imperfection of Human Thought and
Language) Liable to Be Deemed a Mere Attribute. He is Shown to Be a
Personal Being.</span>

<span id="v.ix.vii-p2"></span>Then, therefore, does the Word also
Himself assume His own form and glorious garb, <span
id="fr_7822"></span>[7823](#fn_7822.md) *His own* sound and vocal
utterance, when God says, “Let there be light.” <span
id="fr_7823"></span>[7824](#fn_7823.md) This is the perfect nativity of the
Word, when He proceeds forth from God—*formed* <span
id="fr_7824"></span>[7825](#fn_7824.md) by Him first to devise and think
out *all things* under the name of Wisdom—“The Lord created *or
formed* <span id="fr_7825"></span>[7826](#fn_7825.md) me as the beginning
of His ways;” <span id="fr_7826"></span>[7827](#fn_7826.md) then afterward
*begotten*, to carry all into effect—“When He prepared the heaven, I was
present with Him.” <span id="fr_7827"></span>[7828](#fn_7827.md) Thus does
He make Him equal to Him: for by proceeding from Himself He became His
first-begotten Son, because begotten before all things; <span
id="fr_7828"></span>[7829](#fn_7828.md) and His only-begotten also, because
alone begotten of God, in a way peculiar to Himself, from the womb of
His own heart—even as the Father Himself testifies: “My heart,” says He,
“hath emitted my most excellent Word.” <span
id="fr_7829"></span>[7830](#fn_7829.md) *The Father* took pleasure evermore
in Him, who equally rejoiced with a reciprocal gladness in the Father’s
presence:  “Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten Thee;” <span
id="fr_7830"></span>[7831](#fn_7830.md) even before the morning star did I
<span id="page_602">p. 602</span> <span
id="v.ix.vii-Page_602"></span>beget Thee. The Son likewise acknowledges
the Father, speaking in His own person, under the name of Wisdom: “The
Lord formed Me as the beginning of His ways, with a view to His own
works; before all the hills did He beget Me.” <span
id="fr_7831"></span>[7832](#fn_7831.md) For if indeed Wisdom in this
passage seems to say that She was created by the Lord with a view to His
works, and to accomplish His ways, yet proof is given in another
Scripture that “all things were made by the Word, and without Him was
there nothing made;” <span id="fr_7832"></span>[7833](#fn_7832.md) as,
again, in another place (it is said), “By His word were the heavens
established, and all the powers thereof by His Spirit” <span
id="fr_7833"></span>[7834](#fn_7833.md) —that is to say, by the Spirit (or
Divine Nature) which was in the Word: *thus* is it evident that it is
one and the same power which is in one place described under the name of
Wisdom, and in another passage under the appellation of the Word, which
was initiated for the works of God <span
id="fr_7834"></span>[7835](#fn_7834.md) which “strengthened the
heavens;” <span id="fr_7835"></span>[7836](#fn_7835.md) “by which all
things were made,” <span id="fr_7836"></span>[7837](#fn_7836.md) “and
without which nothing was made.” <span
id="fr_7837"></span>[7838](#fn_7837.md) Nor need we dwell any longer on
this point, as if it were not the very Word Himself, who is spoken of
under the name both of Wisdom and of Reason, and of the entire Divine
Soul and Spirit. He became also the Son of God, and was begotten when He
proceeded forth from Him.  Do you then, (you ask,) grant that the Word
is a certain substance, constructed by the Spirit and the communication
of Wisdom? Certainly I do. But you will not allow Him to be really a
substantive being, by having a substance of His own; in such a way that
He may be regarded as an objective thing and a person, and so be able
(as being constituted second to God *the Father*,) to make two, the
Father and the Son, God and the Word. For you will say, what is a word,
but a voice and sound of the mouth, and (as the grammarians teach) air
when struck against, <span id="fr_7838"></span>[7839](#fn_7838.md)
intelligible to the ear, but for the rest a sort of void, empty, and
incorporeal thing. I, on the contrary, contend that nothing empty and
void could have come forth from God, seeing that it is not put forth
from that which is empty and void; nor could that possibly be devoid of
substance which has proceeded from so great a substance, and has
produced such mighty substances: for all things which were made through
Him, He Himself (personally) made. How could it be, that He Himself is
nothing, without whom nothing was made? How could He who is empty have
made things which are solid, and He who is void have made things which
are full, and He who is incorporeal have made things which have body?
For although a thing may sometimes be made different from him by whom it
is made, yet nothing can be made by that which is a void and empty
thing. Is that Word of God, then, a void and empty thing, which is
called the Son, who Himself is designated God? “The Word was with God,
and the Word was God.” <span id="fr_7839"></span>[7840](#fn_7839.md) It is
written, “Thou shalt not take God’s name in vain.” <span
id="fr_7840"></span>[7841](#fn_7840.md) This for certain is He “who, being
in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.” <span
id="fr_7841"></span>[7842](#fn_7841.md) In what form of God? Of course he
means in some form, not in none. For who will deny that God is a body,
although “God is a Spirit?” <span id="fr_7842"></span>[7843](#fn_7842.md)
For Spirit has a bodily substance of its own kind, in its own
form. <span id="fr_7843"></span>[7844](#fn_7843.md) Now, even if invisible
things, whatsoever they be, have both their substance and their form in
God, whereby they are visible to God alone, how much more shall that
which has been sent forth from His substance not be without substance! 
Whatever, therefore, was the substance of the Word that I designate a
Person, I claim for it the name of *Son*; and while I recognize the Son,
I assert His distinction as second to the Father. <span
