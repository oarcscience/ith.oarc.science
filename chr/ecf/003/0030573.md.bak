<span id="v.vii.xviii-Page_537"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—The Mystery of the
Assumption of Our Perfect Human Nature by the Second Person of the
Blessed Trinity. He is Here Called, as Often Elsewhere, the
Spirit.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xviii-p2"></span>Now, that we may give a simpler answer,
it was not fit that the Son of God should be born of a human father’s
seed, lest, if He were wholly the Son of a man, He should fail to be
also the Son of God, and have nothing more than “a Solomon” or “a
Jonas,” <span id="fr_7185"></span>[7186](#fn_7185.md) —as Ebion <span
id="fr_7186"></span>[7187](#fn_7186.md) thought we ought to believe
concerning Him.  In order, therefore, that He who was already the Son of
God—of God the Father’s seed, that is to say, the Spirit—might also be
the Son of man, He only wanted to assume flesh, of the flesh of
man <span id="fr_7187"></span>[7188](#fn_7187.md) without the seed of a
man; <span id="fr_7188"></span>[7189](#fn_7188.md) for the seed of a man
was unnecessary <span id="fr_7189"></span>[7190](#fn_7189.md) for One who
had the seed of God. As, then, before His birth of the virgin, He was
able to have God for His Father without a human mother, so likewise,
after He was born of the virgin, He was able to have a woman for His
mother without a human father. He is thus man with God, in short, since
He is man’s flesh with God’s Spirit <span
id="fr_7190"></span>[7191](#fn_7190) —*flesh* (I say.md) without seed from
man, *Spirit* with seed from God. For as much, then, as the dispensation
of *God’s* purpose <span id="fr_7191"></span>[7192](#fn_7191.md) concerning
His Son required that He should be born <span
id="fr_7192"></span>[7193](#fn_7192.md) of a virgin, why should He not have
received of the virgin the body which He bore from the virgin? Because,
(forsooth) it is something else which He took from God, for “the Word”
say they, “was made flesh.” <span id="fr_7193"></span>[7194](#fn_7193.md)
Now this very statement plainly shows what it was that was made flesh;
nor can it possibly be that <span id="fr_7194"></span>[7195](#fn_7194.md)
anything else than the Word was made flesh.  Now, whether it was of the
flesh that the Word was made flesh, or whether it was so made of the
(divine) seed itself, the Scripture must tell us. As, however, the
Scripture is silent about everything except what it was that was made
(flesh), and says nothing of that from which it was so made, it must be
held to suggest that from something else, and not from itself, was the
Word made flesh.  And if not from itself, but from something else, from
what can we more suitably suppose that the Word became flesh than from
that flesh in which it submitted to the dispensation? <span
id="fr_7195"></span>[7196](#fn_7195.md) And (we have a proof of the same
conclusion in the fact) that the Lord Himself sententiously and
distinctly pronounced, “that which is born of the flesh is flesh,” <span
id="fr_7196"></span>[7197](#fn_7196.md) even because it is born of the
flesh.  But if He here spoke of a human being simply, and not of
Himself, (as you maintain) then you must deny absolutely that Christ is
man, and must maintain that *human nature* was not suitable to Him. And
then He adds, “That which is born of the Spirit is spirit,” <span
id="fr_7197"></span>[7198](#fn_7197.md) because God is a Spirit, and He was
born of God. Now this description is certainly even more applicable to
Him than it is to those who believe in Him. But if this passage indeed
apply to Him, then why does not the preceding one also? For you cannot
divide their relation, and adapt this to Him, and the previous clause to
all other men, especially as you do not deny that Christ possesses the
two substances, both of the flesh and of the Spirit. Besides, as He was
in possession both of flesh and of Spirit, He cannot possibly, when
speaking of the condition of the two substances which He Himself bears,
be supposed to have determined that the Spirit indeed was His own, but
that the flesh was not His own. Forasmuch, therefore, as He is of the
Spirit He is God the Spirit, and is born of God; just as He is also born
of the flesh of man, being generated in the flesh as man. <span
