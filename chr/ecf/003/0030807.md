id="vi.vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—The Patience of the Heathen
Very Different from Christian Patience. Theirs Doomed to Perdition. Ours
Destined to Salvation.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.xvi-p2"></span>This is the rule, this the discipline,
these the works of patience *which is* heavenly and true; that is, of
Christian *patience*, not false and disgraceful, like as is that
patience of the nations of the earth. For in order that in this also the
devil might rival the Lord, he has as it were quite on a par (except
that the very diversity of evil and good is exactly on a par with their
magnitude <span id="fr_9180"></span>[9181](#fn_9180) .md) taught *his
disciples* also a patience of his own; that, I mean, which, making
husbands venal for dowry, and teaching them to trade in panderings,
makes them subject to the power of their wives; which, with feigned
affection, undergoes every toil of forced complaisance, <span
id="fr_9181"></span>[9182](#fn_9181.md) with a view to ensnaring the
childless; <span id="fr_9182"></span>[9183](#fn_9182.md) which makes the
slaves of the belly <span id="fr_9183"></span>[9184](#fn_9183.md) submit to
contumelious patronage, in the subjection of their liberty to their
gullet. Such pursuits of patience the Gentiles are acquainted with; and
they eagerly seize a name of so great goodness to apply it to foul
practises:  patient they live of rivals, and of the rich, and of such as
give them invitations; impatient of God alone. But let their own and
their leader’s patience look to itself—*a patience* which the
subterraneous fire awaits! Let us, on the other hand, love the patience
of God, the patience of Christ; let us repay to Him the *patience* which
He has paid down for us! Let us offer *to Him* the patience of the
spirit, the patience of the flesh, believing as we do in the
resurrection of flesh and spirit.
