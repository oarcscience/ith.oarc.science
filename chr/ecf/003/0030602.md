<span id="v.viii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Figurative Senses Have Their
Foundation in Literal Fact. Besides, the Allegorical Style is by No
Means the Only One Found in the Prophetic Scriptures, as Alleged by the
Heretics.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xx-p2"></span>Now, to upset all conceits of this sort,
let me dispel at once the preliminary idea on which they rest—their
assertion that the prophets make all their announcements in figures of
speech. Now, if this were the case, the figures themselves could not
possibly have been distinguished, inasmuch as the verities would not
have been declared, out of which the figurative language is stretched.
And, indeed, if all are figures, where will be that of which they are
the figures? How can you hold up a mirror for your face, if the face
nowhere exists? But, in truth, all are not figures, but there are also
literal statements; nor are all shadows, but there are bodies too: so
that we have prophecies about the Lord Himself even, which are clearer
than the day. For it was not figuratively that the Virgin conceived in
her womb; nor in a trope did she bear Emmanuel, that is, Jesus, God with
us. <span id="fr_7394"></span>[7395](#fn_7394) Even granting that He was
figuratively to take the power of Damascus and the spoils of
Samaria, <span id="fr_7395"></span>[7396](#fn_7395) still it was
literally that He was to “enter into judgment with the elders and
princes of the people.” <span id="fr_7396"></span>[7397](#fn_7396) For
in the person of Pilate “the heathen raged,” and in the person of Israel
“the people imagined vain things;” “the kings of the earth” in Herod,
and the rulers in Annas and Caiaphas, were gathered together “against
the Lord, and against His anointed.” <span
id="fr_7397"></span>[7398](#fn_7397) He, again, was “led as a sheep to
the slaughter, and as a sheep before the shearer,” that is, Herod, “is
dumb, so He opened not His mouth.” <span
id="fr_7398"></span>[7399](#fn_7398) “He gave His back to scourges, and
His cheeks to blows, not turning His face even from the shame of
spitting.” <span id="fr_7399"></span>[7400](#fn_7399) “He was numbered
with the transgressors;” <span id="fr_7400"></span>[7401](#fn_7400) “He
was pierced in His hands and His feet;” <span
id="fr_7401"></span>[7402](#fn_7401) “they cast lots for his
raiment;” <span id="fr_7402"></span>[7403](#fn_7402) “they gave Him
gall, and made Him drink vinegar;” <span
id="fr_7403"></span>[7404](#fn_7403) “they shook their heads, and mocked
Him;” <span id="fr_7404"></span>[7405](#fn_7404) “He was appraised by
the traitor in thirty pieces of silver.” <span
id="fr_7405"></span>[7406](#fn_7405) What figures of speech does Isaiah
here give us? What tropes does David? What allegories does Jeremiah? Not
even of His mighty works have they used parabolic language. Or else,
were not the eyes of the blind opened? did not the tongue of the dumb
recover speech? <span id="fr_7406"></span>[7407](#fn_7406) did not the
relaxed hands and palsied knees become strong, <span
id="fr_7407"></span>[7408](#fn_7407) and the lame leap as an hart? <span
id="fr_7408"></span>[7409](#fn_7408) No doubt we are accustomed also to
give a spiritual significance to these statements of prophecy, according
to the analogy of the physical diseases which were healed by the Lord;
but still they were all fulfilled literally: thus showing that the
prophets foretold both senses, except that very many of their words can
only be taken in a pure and simple signification, and free from all
allegorical obscurity; as when we hear of the downfall of nations and
cities, of Tyre and Egypt, and Babylon and Edom, and the navy of
Carthage; also when they foretell Israel’s own chastisements and
pardons, its captivities, restorations, and at last its final
dispersion.  Who would prefer affixing a metaphorical interpretation to
all these events, instead of accepting their literal truth? The
realities are involved in the words, just as the words are read in the
realities.  Thus, then, (we find that) the allegorical style is not used
in all <span id="page_560">p. 560</span> <span
id="v.viii.xx-Page_560"></span>parts of the prophetic record, although
it occasionally occurs in certain portions of it.
