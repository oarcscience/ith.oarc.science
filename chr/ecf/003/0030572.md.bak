id="v.vii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—The Similarity of
Circumstances Between the First and the Second Adam, as to the
Derivation of Their Flesh. An Analogy Also Pleasantly Traced Between Eve
and the Virgin Mary.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xvii-p2"></span>But, leaving Alexander with his
syllogisms, which he so perversely applies in his discussions, as well
as with the hymns of Valentinus, which, with consummate assurance, he
interpolates as the production of some respectable <span
id="fr_7179"></span>[7180](#fn_7179.md) author, let us confine our inquiry
to a single point—Whether Christ received flesh from the virgin?—that we
may thus arrive at a certain proof that His flesh was human, if He
derived its substance from His mother’s womb, although we are at once
furnished with clear evidences of the human character of His flesh, from
its name and description as that of a man, and from the nature of its
constitution, and from the system of its sensations, and from its
suffering of death. Now, it will first be necessary to show what
previous reason there was for the Son of God’s being born of a virgin.
He who was going to consecrate a new order of birth, must Himself be
born after a novel fashion, concerning which Isaiah foretold how that
the Lord Himself would give the sign. What, then, is the sign? “Behold a
virgin shall conceive and bear a son.” <span
id="fr_7180"></span>[7181](#fn_7180.md) Accordingly, a virgin did conceive
and bear “Emmanuel, God with us.” <span
id="fr_7181"></span>[7182](#fn_7181.md) This is the new nativity; a man is
born in God. And in this man God was born, taking the flesh of an
ancient race, without the help, however, of the ancient seed, in order
that He might reform it with a new seed, that is, in a spiritual manner,
and cleanse it by the re-moval of all its ancient stains. But the whole
of this new birth was prefigured, as was the case in all other
instances, in ancient type, the Lord being born as man by a dispensation
in which a virgin was the medium. The earth was still in a virgin state,
reduced as yet by no human labour, with no seed as yet cast into its
furrows, when, as we are told, God made man out of it into a living
soul. <span id="fr_7182"></span>[7183](#fn_7182.md) As, then, the first
Adam is thus introduced to us, it is a just inference that the second
Adam likewise, as the apostle has told us, was formed by God into a
quickening spirit out of the ground,—in other words, out of a flesh
which was unstained as yet by any human generation. But that I may lose
no opportunity of supporting my argument from the name of Adam, why is
Christ called Adam by the apostle, unless it be that, as man, He was of
that earthly origin? And even reason here maintains the same conclusion,
because it was by just the contrary <span
id="fr_7183"></span>[7184](#fn_7183.md) operation that God recovered His
own image and likeness, of which He had been robbed by the devil. For it
was while Eve was yet a virgin, that the ensnaring word had crept into
her ear which was to build the edifice of death. Into a virgin’s soul,
in like manner, must be introduced that Word of God which was to raise
the fabric of life; so that what had been reduced to ruin by this sex,
might by the selfsame sex be recovered to salvation. As Eve had believed
the serpent, so Mary believed the angel. <span
id="fr_7184"></span>[7185](#fn_7184.md) The delinquency which the one
occasioned by believing, the other by believing effaced.  But (it will
be said) Eve did not at the devil’s word conceive in her womb. Well, she
at all events conceived; for the devil’s word afterwards became as seed
to her that she should conceive as an outcast, and bring forth in
sorrow.  Indeed she gave birth to a fratricidal devil; whilst Mary, on
the contrary, bare one who was one day to secure salvation to Israel,
His own brother after the flesh, and the murderer of Himself. God
therefore sent down into the virgin’s womb His Word, as the good
Brother, who should blot out the memory of the evil brother. Hence it
was necessary that Christ should come forth for the salvation of man, in
that condition *of flesh* into which man had entered ever since his
condemnation.
