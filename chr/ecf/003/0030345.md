id="v.iv.iii.i-p3.1"></span>Wherein Tertullian shows that the creator,
or demiurge, whom Marcion calumniated, is the true and good God.</span>

Incorrect and Absurd.  The Proper Course of the Argument.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.i-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.iv.iii.i-p6.1"></span>The</span> occasion of reproducing this
little work, the fortunes of which we noticed in the preface of our
first book, has furnished us with the opportunity of distinguishing, in
our treatment of the subject of two Gods in opposition to Marcion, each
of them with a description and section of his own, according to the
division of the subject-matter, defining one of the gods to have no
existence at all, and maintaining of the Other that He is rightly <span
id="fr_2692"></span>[2693](#fn_2692.md) God; thus far keeping pace with the
heretic of Pontus, who has been pleased to admit one unto, and exclude
the other. <span id="fr_2693"></span>[2694](#fn_2693.md) For he could not
build up his mendacious scheme without pulling down the system of truth.
He found it necessary to demolish <span
id="fr_2694"></span>[2695](#fn_2694.md) some other thing, in order to build
up the theory which he wished. This process, however, is like
constructing a house without preparing suitable materials. <span
id="fr_2695"></span>[2696](#fn_2695.md) The discussion ought to have been
directed to this point alone, that he is no god who supersedes the
Creator. Then, when the false god had been excluded by certain rules
which prescriptively settle what is the character of the One only
perfect Divinity, there could have remained no longer any question as to
the true God. The proof of His existence would have been clear, and
that, too, amid the failure of all evidence in support of any other god;
and still clearer <span id="fr_2696"></span>[2697](#fn_2696.md) would have
seemed the point as to the honour in which He ought without controversy
to be held: that He ought to be worshipped rather than judged; served
reverentially rather than handled critically, or even dreaded for His
severity.  For what was more fully needed by man than a careful estimate
of <span id="fr_2697"></span>[2698](#fn_2697.md) the true God, on whom, so
to speak, he had alighted, <span id="fr_2698"></span>[2699](#fn_2698.md)
because there was no other god?
