<span id="v.viii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Holy Scripture Magnifies the Flesh,
as to Its Nature and Its Prospects.</span>

<span id="v.viii.x-p2"></span>You hold to the scriptures in which the
flesh is disparaged; receive also those in which it is ennobled. You
read whatever passage abases it; direct your eyes also to that which
elevates it. “All flesh is grass.” <span
id="fr_7351"></span>[7352](#fn_7351.md) Well, but Isaiah was not content to
say only this; but he also declared, “All flesh shall see the salvation
of God.” <span id="fr_7352"></span>[7353](#fn_7352.md) They notice God when
He says in Genesis, “My Spirit shall not remain among these men, because
they are flesh;” <span id="fr_7353"></span>[7354](#fn_7353.md) but then He
is also heard saying by Joel, “I will pour out of my Spirit upon all
flesh.” <span id="fr_7354"></span>[7355](#fn_7354.md) Even the apostle
ought not to be known for any one statement in which he is wont to
reproach the flesh. For although he says that “in his flesh dwelleth no
good thing;” <span id="fr_7355"></span>[7356](#fn_7355.md) although he
affirms that “they who are in the flesh cannot please God,” <span
id="fr_7356"></span>[7357](#fn_7356.md) because “the flesh lusteth against
the Spirit;” <span id="fr_7357"></span>[7358](#fn_7357.md) yet in these and
similar assertions which he makes, it is not the *substance* of the
flesh, but its *actions*, which are censured. Moreover, we shall
elsewhere <span id="fr_7358"></span>[7359](#fn_7358.md) take occasion to
remark, that no reproaches can fairly be cast upon the flesh, without
tending also to the castigation of the soul, which compels the flesh to
do its bidding. However, let me meanwhile add that in the same passage
Paul “carries about in his body the marks of the Lord Jesus;” <span
id="fr_7359"></span>[7360](#fn_7359.md) he also forbids our body to be
profaned, as being “the temple of God;” <span
id="fr_7360"></span>[7361](#fn_7360.md) he makes our bodies “the members of
Christ;” <span id="fr_7361"></span>[7362](#fn_7361.md) and he exhorts us to
exalt and “glorify God in our body.” <span
id="fr_7362"></span>[7363](#fn_7362.md) If, therefore, the humiliations of
the flesh thrust off its resurrection, why shall not its high
prerogatives rather avail to bring it about?—since it better suits the
character of God to restore to salvation what for a while He rejected,
than to surrender to perdition what He once approved.
