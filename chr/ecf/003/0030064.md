id="iv.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Idolatry Condemned by Baptism. To
Make an Idol Is, in Fact, to Worship It.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p2"></span>If no law of God had prohibited idols to
be made by us; if no voice of the Holy Spirit uttered general menace no
less against the makers than the worshippers of idols; from our
sacrament itself we would draw our interpretation that arts of that kind
are opposed to the faith. For how have we *renounced* the devil and his
angels, if we *make* them? What divorce have we declared from them, I
say not *with* whom, but *dependent on* whom, we live? What discord have
we entered into with those to whom we are under obligation for the sake
of our maintenance? Can you have denied with the tongue what with the
hand you confess? unmake by word what by deed you make? preach one God,
you who make so many? preach the true God, you who make false ones? “I
*make*,” says one, “but I *worship* not;” as if there were some cause
for which he dare not *worship*, besides that for which he ought not
also to *make*,—the offence done to God, namely, in either case.  Nay,
you who *make*, that they may be able to be worshipped, *do* worship;
and you worship, not with the spirit of some worthless perfume, but with
your own; nor at the expense of a beast’s soul, but of your own. To them
you immolate your ingenuity; to them you make your sweat a libation; to
them you kindle the torch of your forethought. More are you to them than
a priest, since it is by *your* means they *have* a priest; *your*
diligence is *their* divinity. <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198)
Do you affirm that you *worship* not what you *make*? Ah! but *they*
affirm not so, to whom you slay this fatter, more precious and greater
victim, your salvation.

not *exist*, and therefore \[would not be regarded as divinities;
therefore\] your diligence gives them their divinity.
