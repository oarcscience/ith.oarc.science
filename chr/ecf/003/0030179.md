<span id="iv.viii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c17"><span
id="iv.viii.iii-p2.1"></span>A Fragment Concerning the Execrable Gods of
the Heathen.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p3"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p4"></span>So great blindness has fallen on the
Roman race, that they call their enemy Lord, and preach the filcher of
blessings as being their very giver, and to him they give thanks. They
call those (deities), then, by human names, not by their own, for their
own names they know not. That they are dæmons <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100) they understand: but they read
histories of the old kings, and then, though they see that their
character <span id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101) was mortal, they
honour them with a deific name.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p7"></span>As for him whom they call Jupiter, and
think to be the highest god, when he was born the years (that had
elapsed) from the foundation of the world <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102) to him <span
id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103) were some three thousand. He is
born in Greece, from Saturnus and Ops; and, for fear he should be killed
by his father (or else, if it is lawful to say so, should be
begotten <span id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104) anew), is by the
advice of his mother carried down into Crete, and reared in a cave of
Ida; is concealed from his father’s search) by (the aid of) Cretans—born
men! <span id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105) —rattling their arms;
sucks a she-goat’s dugs; flays her; clothes himself in her hide; and
(thus) uses his own nurse’s hide, after killing her, to be sure, with
his own hand! but he sewed thereon three golden tassels worth the price
of an hundred oxen each, as their author Homer <span
id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106) relates, if it is fair to believe
it.  This Jupiter, in adult age, waged war several years with his
father; overcame him; made a parricidal raid on his home; violated his
virgin sisters; <span id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107) selected one
of them in marriage; drave <span id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108)
his father by dint of arms. The remaining scenes, moreover, of that act
have been recorded. Of other folks’ wives, or else of violated virgins,
he begat him sons; defiled freeborn boys; oppressed peoples lawlessly
with despotic and kingly sway. The father, whom they erringly suppose to
have been the *original* god, was ignorant that this (son of his) was
lying concealed in Crete; the son, again, whom they believe the
*mightier* god, knows not that the father whom himself had banished is
lurking in Italy. If he was in heaven, when would he not see what was
doing in Italy? For the Italian land is “not in a corner.” <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109) And yet, had he been a god, nothing
*ought* to have escaped him. But that he whom the Italians call Saturnus
did lurk there, is clearly evidenced on the face of it, from the fact
that from his lurking <span id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110) the
Hesperian <span id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111) tongue is to this
day called Latin, <span id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112) as likewise
their author Virgil relates. <span id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113)
(Jupiter,) then, is said to have been born on earth, while (Saturnus his
father) fears lest he be driven by him from his kingdom, and seeks to
kill him as being his own rival, and knows not that he has been
stealthily carried off, and is in hiding; and afterwards the son-god
pursues his father, immortal seeks to slay immortal (is it
credible? <span id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114) ), and is
disappointed by an interval of sea, and is ignorant <span
id="page_150">p. 150</span> <span id="iv.viii.iii-Page_150"></span>of
(his quarry’s) flight; and while all this is going on between two gods
on earth, heaven is deserted. No one dispensed the rains, no one
thundered, no one governed all this mass of world. <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115) For they cannot even say that their
action and wars took place in heaven; for all this was going on on Mount
Olympus in Greece. Well, but heaven is not called Olympus, for heaven is
heaven.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p22"></span>These, then, are the actions of
theirs, which we will treat of first—nativity, lurking, ignorance,
parricide, adulteries, obscenities—things committed not by a god, but by
most impure and truculent human beings; beings who, had they been living
in these days, would have lain under the impeachment of all laws—laws
which are far more just and strict than *their* actions. “He drave his
father by dint of arms.” The Falcidian and Sempronian law would bind the
parricide in a sack with beasts. “He violated his sisters.” The Papinian
law would punish the outrage with all penalties, limb by limb. “He
invaded others’ wedlock.” The Julian law would visit its adulterous
violator capitally. “He defiled freeborn boys.” The Cornelian law would
condemn the crime of transgressing the sexual bond with novel
severities, sacrilegiously guilty as it is of a novel union. <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116) This being is shown to have had no
divinity either, for he was a human being; his father’s flight escaped
him. To this human being, of such a character, to so wicked a king, so
obscene and so cruel, God’s honour has been assigned by men. Now, to be
sure, if *on earth* he were born and grew up through the advancing
stages of life’s periods, and in it committed all these evils, and yet
is no more in it, what is thought <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117) (of him) but that he is dead? Or
else does foolish error think wings were born him in his old age, whence
to fly heavenward? Why, even *this* may possibly find credit among men
bereft of sense, <span id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118) if indeed
they believe, (as they do,) that he turned into a swan, to beget the
Castors; <span id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119) an eagle, to
contaminate Ganymede; a bull, to violate Europa; gold, to violate Danaë;
a horse, to beget Pirithoüs; a goat, to beget Egyppa <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120) from a she-goat; a Satyr, to
embrace Antiope.  Beholding these adulteries, to which sinners are
prone, they therefore easily believe that sanctions of misdeed and of
every filthiness are borrowed from their feigned god. Do they perceive
how void of amendment are the rest of his career’s acts which can find
credit, which are indeed true, and which, they say, he did without self
transformation? Of Semele, he begets Liber; <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121) of Latona, Apollo and Diana; of
Maia, Mercury; of Alcmena, Hercules. But the rest of his corruptions,
which they themselves confess, I am unwilling to record, lest turpitude,
once buried, be again called to men’s ears. But of these few (offsprings
of his) I have made mention; off-springs whom in their error they
believe to be themselves, too, gods—born, to wit, of an incestuous
father; adulterous births, supposititious births.  And the living, <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122) eternal God, of sempiternal
divinity, prescient of futurity, immeasurable, <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123) they have dissipated (into nothing,
by associating Him) with crimes so unspeakable.

“knowing,” “skilful,” in which case it would come to be used of any
superhuman intelligence; others, again, derive from <span

to.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p11"></span> A Cretibus, hominibus natis. The
force seems to be in the absurdity of supposing that, 1*st*, there
should be human beings (hominibus) *born*, (as Jupiter is said to have
been “born,”) already existing at the time of the “birth” of “the
highest god;” 2*ndly*, that these should have had the power to do him so
essential service as to conceal him from the search of his own father,
likewise a mighty deity, by the simple expedient of rattling their arms.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p20"></span> Oehler does not mark this as a
question. If we follow him, we may render, “this can find belief.” 
Above, it seemed necessary to introduce the parenthetical words to make
some sense. The Latin is throughout very clumsy and incoherent.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p23"></span> Lex Cornelia transgressi fœderis
ammissum novis exemplis novi coitus sacrilegum damnaret. After
consulting Dr. Holmes, I have rendered, but not without hesitation, as
above. “Fœdus” seems to have been technically used, especially in later
Latin, of the *marriage compact*; but what “lex Cornelia” is meant I
have sought vainly to discover, and whether “lex Cornelia transgressi
fœderis” ought not to go together I am not sure. For “a*m*missum”
(=admissum) Migne’s ed. reads “*a*missum,” a very different word. For
“sacrilegus” with a genitive, see *de Res. Carn*, c. xlii. *med*.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p29"></span> Oehler reads “vi*d*e etem;” but
Migne’s “vi*v*entem” seems better: indeed, Oehler’s is probably a
misprint. The punctuation of this treatise in Oehler is very faulty
throughout, and has been disregarded.
