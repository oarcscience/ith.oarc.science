<span id="iv.xi.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—The Evil Spirit Has Marred
the Purity of the Soul from the Very Birth.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xxxix-p2"></span>All these endowments of the soul which
are bestowed on it at birth are still obscured and depraved by the
malignant being who, in the beginning, regarded them with envious eye,
so that they are never seen in their spontaneous action, nor are they
administered as they ought to be. For to what individual of the human
race will not the evil spirit cleave, ready to entrap their souls from
the very portal of their birth, at which he is invited to be present in
all those superstitious processes which accompany childbearing? Thus it
comes to pass that all men are brought to the birth with idolatry for
the midwife, whilst the very wombs that bear them, still bound with the
fillets that have been wreathed before the idols, declare their
offspring to be consecrated to demons: for in parturition they invoke
the aid of Lucina and Diana; for a whole week a table is spread in
honour of Juno; on the last day the fates of the horoscope <span
id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750.md) are invoked; and then the infant’s
first step on the ground is sacred to the goddess Statina. After this
does any one fail to devote to idolatrous service the entire head of his
son, or to take out a hair, or to shave off the whole with a razor, or
to bind it up for an offering, or seal it for sacred use—in behalf of
the clan, of the ancestry, or for public devotion? On this principle of
early possession it was that Socrates, while yet a boy, was found by the
spirit of the demon. Thus, too, is it that to all persons their *genii*
are assigned, which is only another name for *demons*. Hence in no case
(I mean of the heathen, of course) is there any nativity which is pure
of idolatrous superstition. It was from this circumstance that the
apostle said, that when either of the <span id="page_220">p. 220</span>
<span id="iv.xi.xxxix-Page_220"></span>parents was sanctified, the
children were holy; <span id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751.md) and this
as much by the prerogative of the (Christian) seed as by the discipline
of the institution (by baptism, and Christian education). “Else,” says
he, “were the children unclean” by birth: <span
id="fr_1752"></span>[1753](#fn_1752.md) as if he meant us to understand
that the children of believers were designed for holiness, and thereby
for salvation; in order that he might by the pledge of such a hope give
his support to matrimony, which he had determined to maintain in its
integrity. Besides, he had certainly not forgotten what the Lord had so
definitively stated:  “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit,
he cannot enter into the kingdom of God;” <span
id="fr_1753"></span>[1754](#fn_1753.md) in other words, he cannot be holy.
