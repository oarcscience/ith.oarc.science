<span id="v.iv.vi.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The Eternal Home in Heaven.
Beautiful Exposition by Tertullian of the Apostle’s Consolatory Teaching
Against the Fear of Death, So Apt to Arise Under Anti-Christian
Oppression. The Judgment-Seat of Christ—The Idea, Anti-Marcionite.
Paradise.  Judicial Characteristics of Christ Which are Inconsistent
with the Heretical Views About Him; The Apostle’s Sharpness, or
Severity, Shows Him to Be a Fit Preacher of the Creator’s Christ.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.xii-p2"></span>As to the house of this our earthly
dwelling-place, when he says that “we have an eternal home in heaven,
not made with hands,” <span id="fr_5739"></span>[5740](#fn_5739.md) he by
no means would imply that, because it was built by the Creator’s hand,
it must perish in a perpetual dissolution after death. <span
id="fr_5740"></span>[5741](#fn_5740.md) He treats of this subject in order
to offer consolation against the fear of death and the dread of this
very dissolution, as is even more manifest from what follows, when he
adds, that “in this tabernacle of our earthly body we do groan,
earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with the vesture which is from
heaven, <span id="fr_5741"></span>[5742](#fn_5741.md) if so be, that having
been unclothed, <span id="fr_5742"></span>[5743](#fn_5742.md) we shall not
be found naked;” in other words, shall regain that of which we have been
divested, even our body. And again he says: “We that are in this
tabernacle do groan, not as if we were oppressed <span
id="fr_5743"></span>[5744](#fn_5743.md) with an unwillingness to be
unclothed, but (we wish) to be clothed upon.” <span
id="fr_5744"></span>[5745](#fn_5744.md) He here says expressly, what he
touched but lightly <span id="fr_5745"></span>[5746](#fn_5745.md) in his
first epistle, where he wrote:)  “The dead shall be raised incorruptible
(meaning those who had undergone mortality), “and we shall be changed”
(whom God shall find to be yet in the flesh). <span
id="fr_5746"></span>[5747](#fn_5746.md) Both *those* shall be raised
incorruptible, because they shall regain their body—and that a renewed
one, from which shall come their incorruptibility; and *these* also
shall, in the crisis of the last moment, and from their instantaneous
death, whilst encountering the oppressions of anti-christ, undergo a
change, obtaining therein not so much a divestiture of body as “a
clothing upon” with the vesture which is from heaven. <span
id="fr_5747"></span>[5748](#fn_5747.md) So that whilst these shall put on
over their (changed) body this, heavenly raiment, the dead also shall
for their part <span id="fr_5748"></span>[5749](#fn_5748.md) recover their
body, over which they too have a supervesture to put on, even the
incorruption of heaven; <span id="fr_5749"></span>[5750](#fn_5749.md)
because of these it was that he said:  “This corruptible must put on
incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.” <span
id="fr_5750"></span>[5751](#fn_5750) The one put on this (heavenly.md)
apparel, <span id="fr_5751"></span>[5752](#fn_5751.md) when they recover
their bodies; the others put it on as a supervesture, <span
id="fr_5752"></span>[5753](#fn_5752.md) when they indeed hardly lose them
(in the suddenness of their change). It was accordingly not without good
reason that he described them as “not wishing indeed to be unclothed,”
but (rather as wanting) “to be clothed upon;” <span
id="fr_5753"></span>[5754](#fn_5753.md) in other words, as wishing not to
undergo death, but to be surprised into life, <span
id="fr_5754"></span>[5755](#fn_5754) “that this moral (body.md) might be
swallowed up of life,” <span id="fr_5755"></span>[5756](#fn_5755.md) by
being rescued from death in the supervesture of its changed state. This
is why he shows us how much better it is for us not to be sorry, if we
should be surprised by death, and tells us that we even hold of God “the
earnest of His Spirit” <span id="fr_5756"></span>[5757](#fn_5756.md)
(pledged as it were thereby to have “the clothing upon,” which is the
object of our hope), and that “so long as we are in the flesh, we are
absent from the Lord;” <span id="fr_5757"></span>[5758](#fn_5757.md)
moreover, that we ought on this account to prefer <span
id="fr_5758"></span>[5759](#fn_5758.md) “rather to be absent from the body
and to be present with the Lord,” <span
id="fr_5759"></span>[5760](#fn_5759.md) and so to be ready to meet even
death with joy.  In this <span id="page_456">p. 456</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xii-Page_456"></span>view it is that he informs us how “we
must all appear before the judgement-seat of Christ, that every one may
receive the things done in his body, according as he hath done either
good or bad.” <span id="fr_5760"></span>[5761](#fn_5760.md) Since, however,
there is then to be a retribution according to men’s merits, how will
any be able to reckon with <span id="fr_5761"></span>[5762](#fn_5761.md)
God? But by mentioning both the judgment-seat and the distinction
between works good and bad, he sets before us a Judge who is to award
both sentences, <span id="fr_5762"></span>[5763](#fn_5762.md) and has
thereby affirmed that all will have to be present at the tribunal in
their bodies. For it will be impossible to pass sentence except on the
body, for what has been done in the body. God would be unjust, if any
one were not punished or else rewarded in that very condition, <span
id="fr_5763"></span>[5764](#fn_5763.md) wherein the merit was itself
achieved.  “If therefore any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old
things are passed away; behold, all things are become new;” <span
id="fr_5764"></span>[5765](#fn_5764.md) and so is accomplished the prophecy
of Isaiah. <span id="fr_5765"></span>[5766](#fn_5765.md) When also he (in a
later passage) enjoins us “to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of
flesh and blood” <span id="fr_5766"></span>[5767](#fn_5766.md) (since this
substance enters not the kingdom of God <span
id="fr_5767"></span>[5768](#fn_5767) .md); when, again, he “espouses the
church as a chaste virgin to Christ,” <span
id="fr_5768"></span>[5769](#fn_5768.md) a spouse to a spouse in very
deed, <span id="fr_5769"></span>[5770](#fn_5769.md) an image cannot be
combined and compared with what is opposed to the real nature of the
thing (with which it is compared). So when he designates “false
apostles, deceitful workers transforming themselves” into likenesses of
himself, <span id="fr_5770"></span>[5771](#fn_5770.md) of course by their
hypocrisy, he charges them with the guilt of disorderly conversation,
rather than of false doctrine. <span
id="fr_5771"></span>[5772](#fn_5771.md) The contrariety, therefore, was one
of conduct, not of gods. <span id="fr_5772"></span>[5773](#fn_5772.md) If
“Satan himself, too, is transformed into an angel of light,” <span
id="fr_5773"></span>[5774](#fn_5773.md) such an assertion must not be used
to the prejudice of the Creator. The Creator is not an angel, but God.
Into a god of light, and not an angel of light, must Satan then have
been said to be transformed, if he did not mean to call him “the angel,”
which both we and Marcion know him to be. *On Paradise* is the title of
a treatise of ours, in which is discussed all that the subject admits
of. <span id="fr_5774"></span>[5775](#fn_5774.md) I shall here simply
wonder, in connection with this matter, whether a god who has no
dispensation of any kind on earth could possibly have a paradise to call
his own—without perchance availing himself of the paradise of the
Creator, to use it as he does His world—much in the character of a
mendicant. <span id="fr_5775"></span>[5776](#fn_5775.md) And yet of the
removal of a man from earth to heaven we have an instance afforded us by
the Creator in Elijah. <span id="fr_5776"></span>[5777](#fn_5776.md) But
what will excite my surprise still more is the case (next supposed by
Marcion), that a God so good and gracious, and so averse to blows and
cruelty, should have suborned the angel Satan—not his own either, but
the Creator’s—“to buffet” the apostle, <span
id="fr_5777"></span>[5778](#fn_5777.md) and then to have refused his
request, when thrice entreated to liberate him! It would seem,
therefore, that Marcion’s god imitates the Creator’s conduct, who is an
enemy to the proud, even “putting down the mighty from their
seats.” <span id="fr_5778"></span>[5779](#fn_5778.md) Is he then the same
God as He who gave Satan power over the person of Job that his “strength
might be made perfect in weakness?” <span
id="fr_5779"></span>[5780](#fn_5779.md) How is it that the censurer of the
Galatians <span id="fr_5780"></span>[5781](#fn_5780.md) still retains the
very formula of the law:  “In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall
every word be established?” <span id="fr_5781"></span>[5782](#fn_5781.md)
How again is it that he threatens sinners “that he will not spare”
them <span id="fr_5782"></span>[5783](#fn_5782.md) —he, the preacher of a
most gentle god? Yea, he even declares that “the Lord hath given to him
the power of using sharpness in their presence!” <span
id="fr_5783"></span>[5784](#fn_5783.md) Deny now, O heretic, (at your
cost,) that your god is an object to be feared, when his apostle was for
making himself so formidable!

[Next: The Epistle to the Romans. St. Paul Cannot Help Using Phrases
Which Bespeak the Justice of God, Even When He is Eulogizing the Mercies
of the Gospel. Marcion Particularly Hard in Mutilation of This Epistle.
Yet Our Author Argues on Common Ground. The Judgment at Last Will Be in
Accordance with the Gospel. The Justified by Faith Exhorted to Have
Peace with God. The Administration of the Old and the New Dispensations
in One and the Same Hand.](0030459.md)
