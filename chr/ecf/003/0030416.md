<span id="v.iv.v.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Concerning Loans. Prohibition
of Usury and the Usurious Spirit. The Law Preparatory to the Gospel in
Its Provisions; So in the Present Instance. On Reprisals.  Christ’s
Teaching Throughout Proves Him to Be Sent by the Creator.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xvii-p2"></span>And now, on the subject of a loan, when
He asks, “And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank
have ye?” <span id="fr_4092"></span>[4093](#fn_4092.md) compare with this
the following words of Ezekiel, in which He says of the before-mentioned
just man, “He hath not given his money upon usury, nor will he take any
increase” <span id="fr_4093"></span>[4094](#fn_4093.md) —meaning the
redundance of interest, <span id="fr_4094"></span>[4095](#fn_4094.md) which
is usury. The first step was to eradicate the fruit of the money
lent, <span id="fr_4095"></span>[4096](#fn_4095.md) the more easily to
accustom a man to the loss, should it happen, of the money *itself*, the
in<span id="page_373">p. 373</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xvii-Page_373"></span>terest of which he had learnt to lose.
Now this, we affirm, was the function of the law as preparatory to the
gospel. It was engaged in forming the faith of such as would
learn, <span id="fr_4096"></span>[4097](#fn_4096.md) by gradual stages, for
the perfect light of the Christian discipline, through the best precepts
of which it was capable, <span id="fr_4097"></span>[4098](#fn_4097.md)
inculcating a benevolence which as yet expressed itself but
falteringly. <span id="fr_4098"></span>[4099](#fn_4098.md) For *in the
passage of Ezekiel* quoted above He says, “And thou shalt restore the
pledge of the loan” <span id="fr_4099"></span>[4100](#fn_4099.md) —to him,
certainly, who is incapable of repayment, because, as a matter of
course, He would not anyhow prescribe the restoration of a pledge to one
who was solvent. Much more clearly is it enjoined in Deuteronomy: “Thou
shalt not sleep upon his pledge; thou shalt be sure to return to him his
garment about sunset, and he shall sleep in his own garment.” <span
id="fr_4100"></span>[4101](#fn_4100.md) Clearer still is a former passage:
“Thou shalt remit every debt which thy neighbour oweth thee; and of thy
brother thou shalt not require it, because it is called the release of
the Lord thy God.” <span id="fr_4101"></span>[4102](#fn_4101.md) Now, when
He commands that a debt be remitted to a man who shall be unable to pay
it (for it is a still stronger argument when He forbids its being asked
for from a man who is even able to repay it), what else does He teach
than that we should lend to those of whom we cannot receive again,
inasmuch as He has imposed so great a loss on lending? “And ye shall be
the children of God.” <span id="fr_4102"></span>[4103](#fn_4102.md) What
can be more shameless, than for him to be making us his *children*, who
has not permitted us to make children for ourselves by forbidding
marriage? <span id="fr_4103"></span>[4104](#fn_4103.md) How does he propose
to invest his followers with a name which he has already erased?  I
cannot be the son of a eunuch especially when I have for my Father the
same great Being whom the universe claims for its! For is not the
Founder of the universe as much a Father, even of all men, as
(Marcion’s) castrated deity, <span id="fr_4104"></span>[4105](#fn_4104.md)
who is the maker of no existing thing?  Even if the Creator had not
united male and female, and if He had not allowed any living creature
whatever to have children, I yet had this relation to Him <span
id="fr_4105"></span>[4106](#fn_4105.md) before Paradise, before the fall,
before the expulsion, before the two became one. <span
id="fr_4106"></span>[4107](#fn_4106.md) I became His son a second
time, <span id="fr_4107"></span>[4108](#fn_4107.md) as soon as He fashioned
me <span id="fr_4108"></span>[4109](#fn_4108.md) with His hands, and gave
me motion with His inbreathing. Now again He names me His son, not
begetting me into natural life, but into spiritual life. <span
id="fr_4109"></span>[4110](#fn_4109.md) “Because,” says He, “He is kind
unto the unthankful and to the evil.” <span
id="fr_4110"></span>[4111](#fn_4110.md) Well done, <span
id="fr_4111"></span>[4112](#fn_4111.md) Marcion! how cleverly have you
withdrawn from Him the showers and the sunshine, that He might not seem
to be a Creator!  But who is this kind being <span
id="fr_4112"></span>[4113](#fn_4112.md) which hitherto has not been even
known?  How can he be kind who had previously shown no evidences of such
a kindness as this, which consists of the loan to us of sunshine and
rain?—who is not destined to receive from the human race (the homage due
to that) Creator,—who, up to this very moment, in return for His vast
liberality in the gift of the elements, bears with men while they offer
to idols, more readily than Himself, the due returns of His
graciousness. *But God* is truly kind even in spiritual blessings.  “The
utterances <span id="fr_4113"></span>[4114](#fn_4113.md) of the Lord are
sweeter than honey and honeycombs.” <span
id="fr_4114"></span>[4115](#fn_4114.md) He then has taunted <span
id="fr_4115"></span>[4116](#fn_4115.md) men as ungrateful who deserved to
have their gratitude—even He, whose sunshine and rain even you, O
Marcion, have enjoyed, but without gratitude! Your god, however, had no
right to complain of man’s ingratitude, because he had used no means to
make them grateful. Compassion also does He teach: “Be ye merciful,”
says He, “as your Father also that had mercy upon you.” <span
id="fr_4116"></span>[4117](#fn_4116.md) This injunction will be of a piece
with, “Deal thy bread to the hungry; and if he be houseless, bring him
into thine house; and if thou seest the naked, cover him;” <span
id="fr_4117"></span>[4118](#fn_4117.md) also with, “Judge the fatherless,
plead with the widow.” <span id="fr_4118"></span>[4119](#fn_4118.md) I
recognise here that ancient doctrine of Him who “prefers mercy to
sacrifice.” <span id="fr_4119"></span>[4120](#fn_4119.md) If, however, it
be now some other being which teaches mercy, on the ground of his own
mercifulness, how happens it that he has been wanting in mercy to me for
so vast an age? “Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and
ye shall not be condemned; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and
it shall be given unto you:  good measure, pressed down, and running
over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye
meas<span id="page_374">p. 374</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xvii-Page_374"></span>ure withal, it shall be measured to you
again.” <span id="fr_4120"></span>[4121](#fn_4120.md) As it seems to me,
this passage announces a retribution proportioned to the merits.  But
from whom shall come the retribution? If only from men, in that case he
teaches a merely human discipline and recompense; and in everything we
shall have to obey man: if from the Creator, as the Judge and the
Recompenser of merits, then He compels our submission to Him, in whose
hands <span id="fr_4121"></span>[4122](#fn_4121.md) He has placed a
retribution which will be acceptable or terrible according as every man
shall have judged or condemned, acquitted or dealt with, <span
id="fr_4122"></span>[4123](#fn_4122.md) his neighbour; if from (Marcion’s
god) himself, he will then exercise a judicial function which Marcion
denies.  Let the Marcionites therefore make their choice: Will it not be
just the same inconsistency to desert the prescription of their master,
as to have Christ teaching in the interest of men or of the Creator? But
“a blind man will lead a blind man into the ditch.” <span
id="fr_4123"></span>[4124](#fn_4123.md) Some persons believe Marcion. But
“the disciple is not above his master.” <span
id="fr_4124"></span>[4125](#fn_4124.md) Apelles ought to have remembered
this—a corrector of Marcion, although his disciple. <span
id="fr_4125"></span>[4126](#fn_4125.md) The heretic ought to take the beam
out of his own eye, and then he may convict <span
id="fr_4126"></span>[4127](#fn_4126.md) the Christian, should he suspect a
mote to be in *his* eye. Just as a good tree cannot produce evil fruit,
so neither can truth generate heresy; and as a corrupt tree cannot yield
good fruit, so heresy will not produce truth. Thus, Marcion brought
nothing good out of Cerdon’s evil treasure; nor Apelles out of
Marcion’s. <span id="fr_4127"></span>[4128](#fn_4127.md) For in applying to
these heretics the figurative words which Christ used of men in general,
we shall make a much more suitable interpretation of them than if we
were to deduce out of them two gods, according to Marcion’s grievous
exposition. <span id="fr_4128"></span>[4129](#fn_4128.md) I think that I
have the best reason possible for insisting still upon the position
which I have all along occupied, that in no passage to be anywhere found
has another God been revealed by Christ. I wonder that in this place
alone Marcion’s hands should have felt benumbed in their adulterating
labour. <span id="fr_4129"></span>[4130](#fn_4129.md) But even robbers have
their qualms now and then. There is no wrong-doing without fear, because
there is none without a guilty conscience. So long, then, were the Jews
cognisant of no other god but Him, beside whom they knew none else; nor
did they call upon any other than Him whom alone they knew.  This being
the case, who will He clearly be <span
id="fr_4130"></span>[4131](#fn_4130.md) that said, “Why callest thou me
Lord, Lord?” <span id="fr_4131"></span>[4132](#fn_4131.md) Will it be he
who had as yet never been called on, because never yet revealed; <span
id="fr_4132"></span>[4133](#fn_4132.md) or He who was ever regarded as the
Lord, because known from the beginning—even the God of the Jews? Who,
again, could possibly have added, “and do not the things which I say?”
Could it have been he who was only then doing his best <span
id="fr_4133"></span>[4134](#fn_4133.md) to teach them? Or He who from the
beginning had addressed to them His messages <span
id="fr_4134"></span>[4135](#fn_4134.md) both by the law and the prophets?
He could then upbraid them with disobedience, even if He had no ground
at any time else for His reproof. The fact is, that He who was then
imputing to them their ancient obstinacy was none other than He who,
before the coming of Christ, had addressed to them these words, “This
people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart standeth far off
from me.” <span id="fr_4135"></span>[4136](#fn_4135.md) Otherwise, how
absurd it were that a new god, a new Christ, the revealer of a new and
so grand a religion should denounce as obstinate and disobedient those
whom he had never had it in his power to make trial of!
