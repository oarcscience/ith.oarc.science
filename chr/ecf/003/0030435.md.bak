<span id="v.iv.v.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—The Parables of the
Importunate Widow, and of the Pharisee and the Publican. Christ’s Answer
to the Rich Ruler, the Cure of the Blind Man. His Salutation—Son of
David. All Proofs of Christ’s Relation to the Creator, Marcion’s
Antithesis Between David and Christ Confuted.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxxvi-p2"></span>When He recommends perseverance and
earnestness in prayer, He sets before us the parable of the judge who
was compelled to listen to the widow, owing to the earnestness and
importunity of her requests. <span id="fr_4916"></span>[4917](#fn_4916.md)
He show us that it is God the judge whom we must importune with prayer,
and not Himself, if He is not Himself the judge. But He added, that “God
would avenge His own elect.” <span id="fr_4917"></span>[4918](#fn_4917.md)
Since, then, He who judges will also Himself be the avenger, He proved
that the Creator <span id="page_410">p. 410</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxxvi-Page_410"></span>is on that account the specially good
God, <span id="fr_4918"></span>[4919](#fn_4918.md) whom He represented as
the avenger of His own elect, who cry day and night to Him. And yet,
when He introduces *to our view* the Creator’s temple, and describes two
men worshipping therein with diverse feelings—the Pharisee in pride, the
publican in humility—and shows us how they accordingly went down to
their homes, one rejected, <span id="fr_4919"></span>[4920](#fn_4919.md)
the other justified, <span id="fr_4920"></span>[4921](#fn_4920.md) He
surely, by thus teaching us the proper discipline of prayer, has
determined that that God must be prayed to from whom men were to receive
this discipline of prayer—whether condemnatory of pride, or justifying
in humility. <span id="fr_4921"></span>[4922](#fn_4921.md) I do not find
from Christ any temple, any suppliants, any sentence (of approval or
condemnation) belonging to any other god than the Creator. Him does He
enjoin us to worship in humility, as the lifter-up of the humble, not in
pride, because He brings down <span id="fr_4922"></span>[4923](#fn_4922.md)
the proud. What other god has He manifested to me to receive my
supplications?  With what formula of worship, with what hope (shall I
approach him?) I trow, none.  For the prayer which He has taught us
suits, as we have proved, <span id="fr_4923"></span>[4924](#fn_4923.md)
none but the Creator. It is, of course, another matter if He does not
wish to be prayed to, because He is the supremely and spontaneously good
God! But who is this good God? There is, He says, “none but one.” <span
id="fr_4924"></span>[4925](#fn_4924.md) It is not as if He had shown us
that one of two gods was the supremely good; but He expressly asserts
that there is one only good God, who is the only good, because He is the
only God. Now, undoubtedly, <span id="fr_4925"></span>[4926](#fn_4925.md)
He is the good God who “sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust, and
maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good;” <span
id="fr_4926"></span>[4927](#fn_4926.md) sustaining and nourishing and
assisting even Marcionites themselves! When afterwards “a certain man
asked him, ‘Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?’”
(Jesus) inquired whether he *knew* (that is, in other words, whether he
*kept*) the commandments of the Creator, in order to testify <span
id="fr_4927"></span>[4928](#fn_4927.md) that it was by the Creator’s
precepts that eternal life is acquired. <span
id="fr_4928"></span>[4929](#fn_4928.md) Then, when he affirmed that from
his youth up he had kept all the principal commandments, (Jesus) said to
him: “One thing thou yet lackest: sell all that thou hast, and give to
the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow
me.” <span id="fr_4929"></span>[4930](#fn_4929.md) Well now, Marcion, and
all ye who are companions in misery, and associates in hatred <span
id="fr_4930"></span>[4931](#fn_4930.md) with that heretic, what will you
dare say to this? Did Christ rescind the forementioned commandments: “Do
not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false
witness, Honour thy father and thy mother?” Or did He both keep them,
and then add <span id="fr_4931"></span>[4932](#fn_4931.md) what was wanting
to them? This very precept, however, about giving to the poor, was very
largely <span id="fr_4932"></span>[4933](#fn_4932.md) diffused through the
pages of the law and the prophets. This vainglorious observer of the
commandments was therefore convicted <span
id="fr_4933"></span>[4934](#fn_4933.md) of holding money in much higher
estimation (than charity). This verity of the gospel then stands
unimpaired: “I am not come to destroy the law and the prophets, but
rather to fulfil them.” <span id="fr_4934"></span>[4935](#fn_4934.md) He
also dissipated other doubts, when He declared that the name of God and
of the Good belonged to one and the same being, at whose disposal were
also the everlasting life and the treasure in heaven and Himself
too—whose commandments He both maintained and augmented with His own
supplementary precepts. He may likewise be discovered in the following
passage of Micah, saying: “He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and
what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy,
and to be ready to follow the Lord thy God?” <span
id="fr_4935"></span>[4936](#fn_4935.md) Now Christ is the man who tells us
what is *good*, even the knowledge of the law. “Thou knowest,” says He,
“the commandments.” “To do justly”—“Sell all that thou hast;” “to love
mercy”—“Give to the poor:” “and to be ready to walk with God”—“And
come,” says He, “follow me.” <span id="fr_4936"></span>[4937](#fn_4936.md)
The Jewish nation was from its beginning so carefully divided into
tribes and clans, and families and houses, that no man could very well
have been ignorant of his descent—even from the recent assessments of
Augustus, which were still probably extant at this time. <span
id="fr_4937"></span>[4938](#fn_4937.md) But the Jesus of Marcion (although
there could be no doubt of a person’s having been born, who was seen to
be a man), as being unborn, could not, of course, have possessed any
public testimonial <span id="fr_4938"></span>[4939](#fn_4938.md) of his
descent, but was to be regarded as one of that obscure class of whom
nothing was in any way <span id="page_411">p. 411</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxxvi-Page_411"></span>known.  Why then did the blind man, on
hearing that He was passing by, exclaim, “Jesus, Thou Son of David, have
mercy on me?” <span id="fr_4939"></span>[4940](#fn_4939.md) unless he was
considered, in no uncertain manner, <span
id="fr_4940"></span>[4941](#fn_4940.md) to be the Son of David (in other
words, to belong to David’s family) through his mother and his brethren,
who at some time or other had been made known to him by public
notoriety? “Those, however, who went before rebuked the blind man, that
he should hold his peace.” <span id="fr_4941"></span>[4942](#fn_4941.md)
And properly enough; because he was very noisy, not because he was wrong
about the son of David. Else you must show me, that those who rebuked
him were aware that Jesus was not the Son of David, in order that they
may be supposed to have had this reason for imposing silence on the
blind man. But even if you could show me this, still (the blind man)
would more readily have presumed that they were ignorant, than that the
Lord could possibly have permitted an untrue exclamation about Himself.
But the Lord “stood patient.” <span id="fr_4942"></span>[4943](#fn_4942.md)
Yes; but not as confirming the error, for, on the contrary, He rather
displayed the Creator.  Surely He could not have first removed this
man’s blindness, in order that he might afterwards cease to regard Him
as the Son of David! However, <span id="fr_4943"></span>[4944](#fn_4943.md)
that you may not slander <span id="fr_4944"></span>[4945](#fn_4944.md) His
patience, nor fasten on Him any charge of dissimulation, nor deny Him to
be the Son of David, He very pointedly confirmed the exclamation of the
blind man—both by the actual gift of healing, and by bearing testimony
to his faith: “Thy faith,” say Christ, “hath made thee whole.” <span
id="fr_4945"></span>[4946](#fn_4945.md) What would you have the blind man’s
faith to have been? That Jesus was descended from that (alien) god (of
Marcion), to subvert the Creator and overthrow the law and the prophets?
That He was not the destined offshoot from the root of Jesse, and the
fruit of David’s loins, the restorer <span
id="fr_4946"></span>[4947](#fn_4946.md) also of the blind? But I apprehend
there were at that time no such stone-blind persons as Marcion, that an
opinion like this could have constituted the faith of the blind man, and
have induced him to confide in the mere *name*, <span
id="fr_4947"></span>[4948](#fn_4947.md) of Jesus, the Son of David. He, who
knew all this of Himself, <span id="fr_4948"></span>[4949](#fn_4948.md) and
wished others to know it also, endowed the faith of this man—although it
was already gifted with a better sight, and although it was in
possession of the true light—with the external vision likewise, in order
that we too might learn the rule of faith, and at the same time find its
recompense. Whosoever wishes to see Jesus the Son of David must believe
in Him; through the Virgin’s birth. <span
id="fr_4949"></span>[4950](#fn_4949.md) He who will not believe this will
not hear from Him the salutation, “Thy faith hath saved thee.” And so he
will remain blind, falling into *Antithesis* after *Antithesis*, which
mutually destroy each other, <span id="fr_4950"></span>[4951](#fn_4950.md)
just as “the blind man leads the blind down into the ditch.” <span
id="fr_4951"></span>[4952](#fn_4951.md) For (here is one of Marcion’s
*Antitheses*): whereas David in old time, in the capture of Sion, was
offended by the blind who opposed his admission (into the
stronghold) <span id="fr_4952"></span>[4953](#fn_4952.md) —in which respect
(I should rather say) that they were a type of people equally
blind, <span id="fr_4953"></span>[4954](#fn_4953.md) who in after-times
would not admit Christ to be the son of David—so, on the contrary,
Christ succoured the blind man, to show by this act that He was not
David’s son, and how different in disposition He was, kind to the blind,
while David ordered them to be slain. <span
id="fr_4954"></span>[4955](#fn_4954.md) If all this were so, why did
*Marcion* allege that the blind man’s faith was of so worthless <span
id="fr_4955"></span>[4956](#fn_4955.md) a stamp? The fact is, <span
id="fr_4956"></span>[4957](#fn_4956.md) the Son of David so acted, <span
id="fr_4957"></span>[4958](#fn_4957.md) that the *Antithesis* must lose its
point by its own absurdity. <span id="fr_4958"></span>[4959](#fn_4958.md)
Those persons who offended David were blind, and the man who now
presents himself as a suppliant to David’s son is afflicted with the
same infirmity. <span id="fr_4959"></span>[4960](#fn_4959.md) Therefore the
Son of David was appeased with some sort of satisfaction by the blind
man when He restored him to sight, and added His approval of the faith
which had led him to believe the very truth, that he must win to his
help <span id="fr_4960"></span>[4961](#fn_4960.md) the Son of David by
earnest entreaty.  But, after all, I suspect that it was the audacity
(of the old Jebusites) which offended David, and not their malady.
