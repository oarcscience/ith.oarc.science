<span id="v.viii.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—Even Unburied Bodies Will
Be Raised Again. Whatever Befalls Them God Will Restore Them Again.
Jonah’s Case Quoted in Illustration of God’s Power.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxxii-p2"></span>But, that you may not suppose that it
is merely those bodies which are consigned to tombs whose resurrection
is foretold, you have it declared in Scripture: “And I will com<span
id="page_568">p. 568</span> <span id="v.viii.xxxii-Page_568"></span>mand
the fishes of the sea, and they shall cast up the bones which they have
devoured; and I will bring joint to joint, and bone to bone.” You will
ask, Will then the fishes and other animals and carnivorous birds be
raised again, in order that they may vomit up what they have consumed,
on the ground of your reading in the law of Moses, that blood is
required of even all the beasts? Certainly not. But the beasts and the
fishes are mentioned in relation to the restoration of flesh and blood,
in order the more emphatically to express the resurrection of such
bodies as have even been devoured, when redress is said to be demanded
of their very devourers. Now I apprehend that in the case of Jonah we
have a fair proof of this divine power, when he comes forth from the
fish’s belly uninjured in both his natures—his flesh and his soul. No
doubt the bowels of the whale would have had abundant time during three
days for consuming and digesting *Jonah’s* flesh, quite as effectually
as a coffin, or a tomb, or the gradual decay of some quiet and concealed
grave; only that he wanted to prefigure even those beasts (*which
symbolize*) especially the men who are wildly opposed to the *Christian*
name, or the angels of iniquity, of whom blood will be required by the
full exaction of an avenging judgment. Where, then, is the man who,
being more disposed to learn than to assume, more careful to believe
than to dispute, and more scrupulous of the wisdom of God than wantonly
bent on his own, when he hears of a divine purpose respecting sinews and
skin, and nerves and bones, will forthwith devise some different
application of these words, as if all that is said of the substances in
question were not naturally intended for man? For either there is here
no reference to the destiny of man—in the gracious provision of the
kingdom (of heaven), in the severity of the judgment-day, in all the
incidents of the resurrection; or else, if there is any reference to his
destiny, the destination must necessarily be made in reference to those
substances of which the man is composed, for whom the destiny is
reserved. Another question I have also to ask of these very adroit
transformers of bones and sinews, and nerves and sepulchres: Why, when
anything is declared of *the soul*, do they not interpret the soul to be
something else, and transfer it to another signification?—since,
whenever any distinct statement is made of a *bodily* substance, they
will obstinately prefer taking any other sense whatever, rather than
that which the name indicates. If things which pertain to the body are
figurative, why are not those which pertain to the soul figurative
also?  Since, however, things which belong to the soul have nothing
allegorical in them, neither therefore have those which belong to the
body. For man is as much body as he is soul; so that it is impossible
for one of these natures to admit a figurative sense, and the other to
exclude it.
