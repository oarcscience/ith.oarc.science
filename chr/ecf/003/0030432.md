<span id="v.iv.v.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—The Marcionite
Interpretation of God and Mammon Refuted. The Prophets Justify Christ’s
Admonition Against Covetousness and Pride. John Baptist the Link Between
the Old and the New Dispensations of the Creator. So Said Christ—But So
Also Had Isaiah Said Long Before. One Only God, the Creator, by His Own
Will Changed the Dispensations.  No New God Had a Hand in the
Change.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxxiii-p2"></span>What the two masters are who, He
says, cannot be served, <span id="fr_4771"></span>[4772](#fn_4771.md) on
the ground that while one is pleased <span
id="fr_4772"></span>[4773](#fn_4772.md) the other must needs be
displeased, <span id="fr_4773"></span>[4774](#fn_4773.md) He Himself makes
clear, when He mentions God and mammon. Then, if you have no interpreter
by you, you may learn <span id="page_403">p. 403</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxxiii-Page_403"></span>again from Himself what He would have
understood by *mammon*. <span id="fr_4774"></span>[4775](#fn_4774.md) For
when advising us to provide for ourselves the help of friends in worldly
affairs, after the example of that steward who, when removed from his
office, <span id="fr_4775"></span>[4776](#fn_4775.md) relieves his lord’s
debtors by lessening their debts with a view to their recompensing him
with their help, He said, “And I say unto you, Make to yourselves
friends of the *mammon* of unrighteousness,” that is to say, of money,
even as the steward had done. Now we are all of us aware that money is
the instigator <span id="fr_4776"></span>[4777](#fn_4776.md) of
unrighteousness, and the lord of the whole world. Therefore, when he saw
the covetousness of the Pharisees doing servile worship <span
id="fr_4777"></span>[4778](#fn_4777.md) to it, He hurled <span
id="fr_4778"></span>[4779](#fn_4778.md) this sentence against them, “Ye
cannot serve God and mammon.” <span id="fr_4779"></span>[4780](#fn_4779.md)
Then the Pharisees, who were covetous of riches, derided Him, when they
understood that by mammon He meant money. Let no one think that under
the word mammon the Creator was meant, and that Christ called them off
from the service of the Creator. What *folly*! Rather learn therefrom
that one God was pointed out by Christ. For they were two masters whom
He named, God and mammon—the Creator and money. You cannot indeed serve
God—Him, of course whom they seemed to serve—and mammon to whom they
preferred to devote themselves. <span
id="fr_4780"></span>[4781](#fn_4780.md) If, however, he was giving himself
out as another *god*, it would not be two masters, but three, that he
had pointed out.  For the Creator was a master, and much more of a
master, to be sure, <span id="fr_4781"></span>[4782](#fn_4781.md) than
mammon, and more to be adored, as being more truly our Master. Now, how
was it likely that He who had called mammon a master, and had associated
him with God, should say nothing of Him who was really the Master of
even these, that is, the Creator? Or else, by this silence respecting
Him did He concede that service might be rendered to *Him*, since it was
to Himself alone and to mammon that He said service could not be
(simultaneously) rendered?  When, therefore, He lays down the position
that God is one, since He would have been sure to mention <span
id="fr_4782"></span>[4783](#fn_4782.md) the Creator if He were Himself a
rival <span id="fr_4783"></span>[4784](#fn_4783.md) to Him, He did
(virtually) name the Creator, when He refrained from insisting” <span
id="fr_4784"></span>[4785](#fn_4784.md) that He was Master alone, without a
rival god.  Accordingly, this will throw light upon the sense in which
it was said, “If ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon,
who will commit to your trust the true riches?” <span
id="fr_4785"></span>[4786](#fn_4785.md) “In the unrighteous mammon,” that
is to say, in unrighteous riches, not in the Creator; for even Marcion
allows Him to be righteous: “And if ye have not been faithful in that
which is another man’s, who will give to you that which is mine?” <span
id="fr_4786"></span>[4787](#fn_4786.md) For whatever is unrighteous ought
to be foreign to the servants of God. But in what way was the Creator
foreign to the Pharisees, seeing that He was the proper God of the
Jewish nation?  Forasmuch then as the words, “Who will entrust to you
the truer riches?” and, “Who will give you that which is mine?” are only
suitable to the Creator and not to mammon, He could not have uttered
them as alien to the Creator, and in the interest of the rival god. He
could only seem to have spoken them in this sense, if, when
remarking <span id="fr_4787"></span>[4788](#fn_4787.md) their
unfaithfulness to the Creator and not to mammon, He had drawn some
distinctions between the Creator (in his manner of mentioning Him) and
the rival god—how that the latter would not commit his own truth to
those who were unfaithful to the Creator. How then can he possibly seem
to belong to another god, if He be not set forth, with the express
intention of being separated <span id="fr_4788"></span>[4789](#fn_4788.md)
from the very thing which is in question.  But when the Pharisees
“justified themselves before men,” <span
id="fr_4789"></span>[4790](#fn_4789.md) and placed their hope of reward in
man, He censured them in the sense in which the prophet Jeremiah said,
“Cursed is the man that trusteth in man.” <span
id="fr_4790"></span>[4791](#fn_4790.md) Since the prophet went on to say,
“But the Lord knoweth your hearts,” <span
id="fr_4791"></span>[4792](#fn_4791.md) he magnified the power of that God
who declared Himself to be as a lamp, “searching the reins and the
heart.” <span id="fr_4792"></span>[4793](#fn_4792.md) When He strikes at
pride in the words: “That which is highly esteemed among men is
abomination in the sight of God,” <span
id="fr_4793"></span>[4794](#fn_4793.md) He recalls Isaiah: “For the day of
the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and
upon every one that is arrogant and lifted up, and they shall be brought
low.” <span id="fr_4794"></span>[4795](#fn_4794.md) I can now make out
<span id="page_404">p. 404</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxxiii-Page_404"></span>why Marcion’s god was for so long an
age concealed. He was, I suppose, waiting until he had learnt all these
things from the Creator. He continued his pupillage up to the time of
John, and then proceeded forthwith to announce the kingdom of God,
saying: “The law and the prophets were until John; since that time the
kingdom of God is proclaimed.” <span
id="fr_4795"></span>[4796](#fn_4795.md) Just as if we also did not
recognise in John a certain limit placed between the old dispensation
and the new, at which Judaism ceased and Christianity began—without,
however, supposing that it was by the power of another god that there
came about a cessation <span id="fr_4796"></span>[4797](#fn_4796.md) of the
law and the prophets and the commencement of that gospel in which is the
kingdom of God, Christ Himself. For although, as we have shown, the
Creator foretold that the old state of things would pass away and a new
state would succeed, yet, inasmuch as John is shown to be both the
forerunner and the preparer of the ways of that Lord who was to
introduce the gospel and publish the kingdom of God, it follows from the
very fact that John has come, that Christ must be that very Being who
was to follow His harbinger John. So that, if the old course has ceased
and the new has begun, with John intervening between them, there will be
nothing wonderful in it, because it happens according to the purpose of
the Creator; so that you may get a better proof for the kingdom of God
from any quarter, however anomalous, <span
id="fr_4797"></span>[4798](#fn_4797.md) than from the conceit that the law
and the prophets ended in John, and a new state of things began after
him. “More easily, therefore, may heaven and earth pass away—as also the
law and the prophets—than that one tittle of the Lord’s words should
fail.” <span id="fr_4798"></span>[4799](#fn_4798.md) “For,” as says Isaiah:
“the word of our God shall stand for ever.” <span
id="fr_4799"></span>[4800](#fn_4799.md) Since even *then* by Isaiah it was
Christ, the Word and Spirit <span id="fr_4800"></span>[4801](#fn_4800.md)
of the Creator, who prophetically described John as “the voice of one
crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the Lord,” <span
id="fr_4801"></span>[4802](#fn_4801.md) and as about to come for the
purpose of terminating thenceforth the course of the law and the
prophets; by their fulfilment and not their extinction, and in order
that the kingdom of God might be announced by Christ, He therefore
purposely added the assurance that the elements would more easily pass
away than His words fail; affirming, as He did, the further fact, that
what He had said concerning John had not fallen to the ground.

<span id="v.iv.v.xxxiii-p6"></span> What in the Punic language is called
*Mammon*, says Rigaltius, the Latins call *lucrum*, “gain or lucre.” See
Augustine, *Serm*. xxxv. *de Verbo domini*. I would add Jerome, *On the*
VI. *of Matthew* where he says: “In the Syriac tongue, *riches* are
called *mammon*.” And Augustine, in another passage, book ii., *On the
Lord’s Sermon on the Mount*, says: “*Riches* in Hebrew are said to be
called *mammon*.  This is evidently a Punic word, for in that language
the synonyme for *gain* (*lucrum*) is *mammon*.” Compare the same author
