<span id="v.iv.vi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—The Doctrine of the
Resurrection. The Body Will Rise Again. Christ’s Judicial Character.
Jewish Perversions of Prophecy Exposed and Confuted. Messianic Psalms
Vindicated. Jewish and Rationalistic Interpretations on This Point
Similar.  Jesus—Not Hezekiah or Solomon—The Subject of These Prophecies
in the Psalms. None But He is the Christ of the Old and the New
Testaments.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.ix-p2"></span>Meanwhile the Marcionite will exhibit
nothing of this kind; he is by this time afraid to say which side has
the better right to a Christ who is not yet revealed. Just as my Christ
is to be expected, <span id="fr_5580"></span>[5581](#fn_5580.md) who was
predicted from the beginning, so his Christ therefore has no existence,
as not having been *announced* from the beginning. Ours is a better
faith, which believes in a future Christ, than the heretic’s, which has
none at all to believe in. Touching the resurrection of the dead, <span
id="fr_5581"></span>[5582](#fn_5581.md) let us first inquire how some
persons then denied it. No doubt in the same way in which it is even now
denied, since the resurrection of the flesh has at all times men to deny
it. But many wise men claim for the soul a divine nature, and are
confident of its undying destiny, and even the multitude worship the
dead <span id="fr_5582"></span>[5583](#fn_5582.md) in the presumption which
they boldly entertain that their souls survive. As for our bodies,
however, it is manifest that they perish either at once by fire or the
wild beasts, <span id="fr_5583"></span>[5584](#fn_5583.md) or even when
most carefully kept by length of time. When, therefore, the apostle
refutes those who deny the resurrection of the flesh, he indeed defends,
in opposition to them, the precise matter of their denial, that is, the
resurrection of the body. You have the whole answer wrapped up in
this. <span id="fr_5584"></span>[5585](#fn_5584.md) All the rest is
superfluous. Now in this very point, which is called the resurrection of
the dead, it is requisite that the proper force of the words should be
accurately maintained. <span id="fr_5585"></span>[5586](#fn_5585.md) The
word *dead* expresses simply what has lost the vital principle, <span
id="fr_5586"></span>[5587](#fn_5586.md) by means of which it used to live.
Now the body is that which loses life, and as the result of losing it
becomes dead. To the *body*, therefore, the term dead is only suitable.
Moreover, as resurrection accrues to what is dead, and dead is a term
applicable only to a body, therefore the body alone has a resurrection
incidental to it. So again the word Resurrection, or (*rising again*),
embraces only that which has fallen down. “To rise,” indeed, can be
predicated of that which has never fallen down, but had already been
always lying down. But “to rise *again*” is predicable only of that
which has fallen down; because it is by rising *again*, in consequence
of its having fallen down, that it is said to have *re*-risen. <span
id="fr_5587"></span>[5588](#fn_5587.md) For the syllable RE always implies
iteration (or happening *again*). We say, therefore, that the body falls
to the ground by death, as indeed facts themselves show, in accordance
with the law of God. For to the body it was said, (“Till thou return to
the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for) dust thou art, and unto
dust shalt thou return.” <span id="fr_5588"></span>[5589](#fn_5588.md)
That, therefore, which came from the ground shall return to the ground.
Now that falls down which returns to the ground; and that rises again
which falls down. “Since by man came death, by man came also the
resurrection.” <span id="fr_5589"></span>[5590](#fn_5589.md) Here in the
word *man*, who consists of bodily substance, as we have often shown
already, is presented to me the body of Christ.  But if we are all so
made alive in Christ, as we die in Adam, it follows of necessity that we
are made alive in Christ as a bodily substance, since we died in Adam as
a bodily substance. The similarity, indeed, is not complete, unless our
revival <span id="fr_5590"></span>[5591](#fn_5590.md) in Christ concur in
identity <span id="page_448">p. 448</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.ix-Page_448"></span>of substance with our mortality <span
id="fr_5591"></span>[5592](#fn_5591.md) in Adam. But at this point <span
id="fr_5592"></span>[5593](#fn_5592) (the apostle.md) has made a
parenthetical statement <span id="fr_5593"></span>[5594](#fn_5593.md)
concerning Christ, which, bearing as it does on our present discussion,
must not pass unnoticed. For the resurrection of the body will receive
all the better proof, in proportion as I shall succeed in showing that
Christ belongs to that God who is believed to have provided this
resurrection of the flesh in His dispensation. When he says, “For He
must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His feet,” <span
id="fr_5594"></span>[5595](#fn_5594.md) we can see at once <span
id="fr_5595"></span>[5596](#fn_5595.md) from this statement that he speaks
of a God of vengeance, and therefore of Him who made the following
promise to Christ:  “Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine
enemies Thy footstool. The rod of Thy strength shall the Lord send forth
from Sion, and He shall rule along with Thee in the midst of Thine
enemies.” <span id="fr_5596"></span>[5597](#fn_5596.md) It is necessary for
me to lay claim to those Scriptures which the Jews endeavour to deprive
us of, and to show that they sustain my view. Now they say that this
Psalm <span id="fr_5597"></span>[5598](#fn_5597.md) was a chant in honour
of Hezekiah, <span id="fr_5598"></span>[5599](#fn_5598.md) because “he went
up to the house of the Lord,” <span id="fr_5599"></span>[5600](#fn_5599.md)
and God turned back and removed his enemies.  Therefore, (as they
further hold,) those other words, “Before the morning star did I beget
thee from the womb,” <span id="fr_5600"></span>[5601](#fn_5600.md) are
applicable to Hezekiah, and to the birth of Hezekiah. We on our
side <span id="fr_5601"></span>[5602](#fn_5601.md) have published Gospels
(to the credibility of which we have to thank <span
id="fr_5602"></span>[5603](#fn_5602.md) them <span
id="fr_5603"></span>[5604](#fn_5603.md) for having given some confirmation,
indeed, already in so great a subject <span
id="fr_5604"></span>[5605](#fn_5604) .md); and these declare that the Lord
was born *at night*, that so it might be “before the morning star,” as
is evident both from the star especially, and from the testimony of the
angel, who at night announced to the shepherds that Christ had at that
moment been born, <span id="fr_5605"></span>[5606](#fn_5605.md) and again
from the place of the birth, for it is towards night that persons arrive
at the (eastern) “inn.” Perhaps, too, there was a mystic purpose in
Christ’s being born at night, destined, as He was, to be the light of
the truth amidst the dark shadows of ignorance. Nor, again, would God
have said, “I have begotten Thee,” except to His true Son.  For although
He says of all the people (Israel), “I have begotten <span
id="fr_5606"></span>[5607](#fn_5606.md) children,” <span
id="fr_5607"></span>[5608](#fn_5607.md) yet He added not “from the womb.”
Now, why should He have added so superfluously this phrase “from the
womb” (as if there could be any doubt about any one’s having been born
from the womb), unless the Holy Ghost had wished the words to be with
especial care <span id="fr_5608"></span>[5609](#fn_5608.md) understood of
Christ? “I have begotten Thee from the womb,” that is to say, *from a
womb only*, without a man’s seed, making it a condition of a fleshly
body <span id="fr_5609"></span>[5610](#fn_5609.md) that it should come out
of a womb. What is here added (in the Psalm), “Thou art a priest for
ever,” <span id="fr_5610"></span>[5611](#fn_5610) relates to (Christ.md)
Himself. Hezekiah was no priest; and even if he had been one, he would
not have been a priest *for ever*. “After the order,” says He, “of
Melchizedek.” Now what had Hezekiah to do with Melchizedek, the priest
of the most high God, and him uncircumcised too, who blessed the
circumcised Abraham, after receiving from him the offering of tithes? To
Christ, however, “the order of Melchizedek” will be very suitable; for
Christ is the proper and legitimate High Priest of God. He is the
Pontiff of the priesthood of the uncircumcision, constituted such, even
then, for the Gentiles, by whom He was to be more fully received,
although at His last coming He will favour with His acceptance and
blessing the circumcision also, even the race of Abraham, which by and
by is to acknowledge Him. Well, then, there is also another Psalm, which
begins with these words: “Give Thy judgments, O God, to the King,” that
is, to Christ who was to come as King, “and Thy righteousness unto the
King’s son,” <span id="fr_5611"></span>[5612](#fn_5611.md) that is, to
Christ’s people; for His <span id="page_449">p. 449</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.ix-Page_449"></span>sons are they who are born again in Him.
But it will here be said that this Psalm has reference to Solomon. 
However, will not those portions of the Psalm which apply to Christ
alone, be enough to teach us that all the rest, too, relates to Christ,
and not to Solomon? “He shall come down,” says He, “like rain upon a
fleece, <span id="fr_5612"></span>[5613](#fn_5612.md) and like dropping
showers upon the earth,” <span id="fr_5613"></span>[5614](#fn_5613.md)
describing His descent from heaven to the flesh as gentle and
unobserved. <span id="fr_5614"></span>[5615](#fn_5614.md) Solomon, however,
if he had indeed any descent at all, came not down like a shower,
because he descended not from heaven. But I will set before you more
literal points. <span id="fr_5615"></span>[5616](#fn_5615.md) “He shall
have dominion,” says the Psalmist, “from sea to sea, and from the river
unto the ends of the earth.” <span id="fr_5616"></span>[5617](#fn_5616.md)
To Christ alone was this given; whilst Solomon reigned over only the
moderately-sized kingdom of Judah. “Yea, all kings shall fall down
before Him.” Whom, indeed, shall they all thus worship, except Christ?
“All nations shall serve Him.” <span
id="fr_5617"></span>[5618](#fn_5617.md) To whom shall all thus do homage,
but Christ? “His name shall endure for ever.” Whose name has this
eternity of fame, but Christ’s? “Longer than the sun shall His name
remain,” for longer than the sun shall be the Word of God, even Christ.
“And in Him shall all nations be blessed.” <span
id="fr_5618"></span>[5619](#fn_5618.md) In Solomon was *no* nation blessed;
in Christ *every* nation. And what if the Psalm proves Him to be even
God? “They shall call Him *blessed*.” <span
id="fr_5619"></span>[5620](#fn_5619) (On what ground?.md) Because *blessed*
is the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wonderful things.” <span
id="fr_5620"></span>[5621](#fn_5620.md) “*Blessed* also is His glorious
name, and with His glory shall all the earth be filled.” <span
id="fr_5621"></span>[5622](#fn_5621.md) On the contrary, Solomon (as I make
bold to affirm) lost even the glory which he had from God, seduced by
his love of women even into idolatry. And thus, the statement which
occurs in about the middle of this Psalm, “His enemies shall lick the
dust” <span id="fr_5622"></span>[5623](#fn_5622.md) (of course, as having
been, (to use the apostle’s phrase,) “put under His feet” <span
id="fr_5623"></span>[5624](#fn_5623) .md), will bear upon the very object
which I had in view, when I both introduced the Psalm, and insisted on
my opinion of its sense,—namely, that I might demonstrate both the glory
of His kingdom and the subjection of His enemies in pursuance of the
Creator’s own plans, with the view of laying down <span
id="fr_5624"></span>[5625](#fn_5624.md) this conclusion, that none but He
can be believed to be *the Christ* of the Creator.

<span id="v.iv.vi.ix-p23"></span> Tertullian, as usual, argues from the
Septuagint, which in the latter clause of [Ps. cx.
3](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003.md)<span id="v.iv.vi.ix-p23.1"></span>
has <span class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.vi.ix-p23.2"></span>ἐκ γαστρὸς
πρὸ ἑωσφόρου ἐγέννησά σε</span>; and so the *Vulgate* version has it.
This Psalm has been variously applied by the Jews. Raschi (or Rabbi Sol.
Jarchi) thinks it is most suitable to *Abraham*, and possibly to
*David*, in which latter view D. Kimchi agrees with him.  Others find in
*Solomon* the best application; but more frequently is *Hezekiah*
thought to be the subject of the Psalm, as Tertullian observes. Justin
Martyr (in *Dial. cum Tryph.*) also notices this application of the
Psalm. But Tertullian in the next sentence appears to recognize the
sounder opinion of the *older* Jews, who saw in this [Ps.
cx](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#000.md)<span id="v.iv.vi.ix-p23.3"></span>.
a prediction of <span class="sc"><span
id="v.iv.vi.ix-p23.5"></span>Messiah</span>.  This opinion occurs in the
Jerusalem Talmud, in the tract *Berachoth*, 5. Amongst the *more recent*
Jews who also hold the sounder view, may be mentioned Rabbi Saadias
Gaon, on [Dan. vii. 13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.iv.vi.ix-p23.6"></span>, and R. Moses Hadarsan \[singularly enough
quoted by Raschi in another part of his commentary ([Gen. xxxv.
8](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#008.md)<span
id="v.iv.vi.ix-p23.7"></span>)\], with others who are mentioned by
Wetstein, *On the New Testament*, [Matt. xxii.
44](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#044.md)<span id="v.iv.vi.ix-p23.8"></span>.
*Modern* Jews, such as Moses Mendelsohn, reject the Messianic sense; and
they are followed by the commentators of the Rationalist school amongst
ourselves and in Germany. J. Olshausen, after Hitzig, comes down in his
interpretation of the Psalm as late as the Maccabees, and sees a
suitable accomplishment of its words in the honours heaped upon
*Jonathan* by Alexander son of Antiochus Epiphanes (see [1 Macc. x.
20](../../../bib/apo/ma1010.htm#020.md)<span
id="v.iv.vi.ix-p23.9"></span>). For the refutation of so inadequate a
commentary, the reader is referred to Delitzch on [Ps.
cx.](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#000.md)<span
id="v.iv.vi.ix-p23.10"></span> The variations of opinion, however, in
this school, are as remarkable as the fluctuations of the Jewish
writers. The latest work on the Psalms which has appeared amongst us
(*Psalms, chronologically arranged*, by four Friends), after Ewald,
places the *accomplishment* of [Ps.
cx](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#000.md)<span
id="v.iv.vi.ix-p23.11"></span>. in what may be allowed to have been its
*occasion*—David’s victories over the neighboring heathen.
