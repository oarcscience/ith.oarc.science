id="v.iii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—Let Heretics Maintain Their
Claims by a Definite and Intelligible Evidence. This the Only Method of
Solving Their Questions. Catholics Appeal Always to Evidence Traceable
to Apostolic Sources.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxxv-p2"></span>Challenged and refuted by us, according
to these definitions, let all the heresies boldly on their part also
advance similar rules to these against our doctrine, whether they be
later than the apostles or contemporary with the apostles, provided they
be different from them; provided also they were, by either a general or
a specific censure, precondemned by them. For since they deny the truth
of (our doctrine), they ought to prove that it also is heresy, refutable
by the same rule as that by which they are themselves refuted; and at
the same time to show us where we must seek the truth, which it is by
this time evident has no existence amongst them.  Our system <span
id="fr_2227"></span>[2228](#fn_2227.md) is not behind any in date; on the
contrary, it is earlier than all; and this fact will be the evidence of
that truth which everywhere occupies the first place. The apostles,
again, nowhere condemn it; they rather defend it,—a fact which will show
that it comes from themselves. <span
id="fr_2228"></span>[2229](#fn_2228.md) For that doctrine which they
refrain from condemning, when they have condemned every strange opinion,
they show to be their own, and on that ground too they defend it.
