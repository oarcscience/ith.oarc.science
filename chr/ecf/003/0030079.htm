<p class="c19"><a name="iv.iv.xxi-p2"></A>But it is a mark of timidity, when some other man binds you in the name of his gods, by the making of an oath, or by some other form of attestation, and you, for fear of discovery,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">330</FONT></A>
 remain quiet. For you equally, by remaining quiet, affirm their majesty, by reason of which <i>majesty</i> you will seem to be bound.&#160; What matters it, whether you affirm the gods of the nations by calling them gods, or by hearing them so called?&#160; Whether you swear by idols, or, when adjured by another, acquiesce? Why should we not recognize the subtleties of Satan, who makes it his aim that, what he cannot effect by <i>our</i> mouth, he may effect by the mouth of his servants, introducing idolatry into us through our ears? At all events, whoever the adjurer is, he binds you to himself either in friendly or unfriendly conjunction. If in unfriendly, you are now challenged unto battle, and know that you must fight. If in friendly, with how far greater security will you transfer your engagement unto the Lord, that you may dissolve the obligation of him through whose means the Evil One was seeking to annex you to the honour of idols, that is, to idolatry!&#160; All sufferance of that kind is idolatry.&#160; You honour those to whom, when imposed as authorities, you have rendered respect. I know that one (whom the Lord pardon!), when it had been said to him in public during a law-suit, &#8220;Jupiter be wroth with you,&#8221; answered, &#8220;On the contrary, with <i>you</i>.&#8221; What else would a heathen have done who believed Jupiter to be a god? For even had he not retorted the malediction by Jupiter (or other such like), yet, <i>by merely</i> returning a curse, he would have confirmed the divinity of Jove, showing himself irritated by a malediction in Jove&#146;s name. For what is there to be indignant at, (if cursed) in the name of one whom you know to be nothing? For if you rave, you immediately affirm his existence, and the profession of your fear will be an act of idolatry. How much more, while you are returning the malediction in the name of Jupiter himself, are you doing honour to Jupiter in the same way as he who provoked you! But a believer ought to laugh in such cases, not to rave; nay, according to the precept,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_330"></A><A HREF="#fn_330"><FONT SIZE="1">331</FONT></A>
 not to return a curse in the name of God even, but dearly to <i>bless</i> in the name of God, that you may both demolish idols and preach God, and fulfil discipline.</p>
