<p class="c30"><a name="v.v.ii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="v.v.ii-p1.1"></A>Chapter II.&#8212;Hermogenes, After a Perverse Induction from Mere Heretical Assumptions, Concludes that God Created All Things Out of Pre-Existing Matter.</span></p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="v.v.ii-p2"></A>Our very bad painter has coloured this his primary shade absolutely without any light, with such arguments as these: He begins with laying down the premiss,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6142"></A><A HREF="#fn_6142"><FONT SIZE="1">6143</FONT></A>
 that the Lord made all things either out of Himself, or out of nothing, or out of something; in order that, after he has shown that it was impossible for Him to have made them either out of Himself or out of nothing, he might thence affirm the residuary proposition that He made them out of something, and therefore that that something was Matter.&#160; He could not have made all things, he says, of Himself; because whatever <A NAME="page_478"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 478</FONT></A> <a name="v.v.ii-Page_478"></A>things the Lord made of Himself would have been parts of Himself; but&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6143"></A><A HREF="#fn_6143"><FONT SIZE="1">6144</FONT></A>
 He is not dissoluble into parts,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6144"></A><A HREF="#fn_6144"><FONT SIZE="1">6145</FONT></A>
 because, being the Lord, He is indivisible, and unchangeable, and always the same. Besides, if He had made anything out of Himself, it would have been something of Himself. Everything, however, both which was made and which He made must be accounted imperfect, because it was made of a part, and He made it of a part; or if, again, it was a whole which He made, who is a whole Himself, He must in that case have been at once both a whole, and yet not a whole; because it behoved Him to be a whole, that He might produce Himself,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6145"></A><A HREF="#fn_6145"><FONT SIZE="1">6146</FONT></A>
 and yet not a whole, that He might be produced out of Himself.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6146"></A><A HREF="#fn_6146"><FONT SIZE="1">6147</FONT></A>
 But this is a most difficult position. For if He were in existence, He could not be made, for He was in existence already; if, however, he were not in existence He could not make, because He was a nonentity.&#160; He <i>maintains</i>, moreover, that He who always exists, does not <i>come into</i> existence,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6147"></A><A HREF="#fn_6147"><FONT SIZE="1">6148</FONT></A>
 but exists for ever and ever. He accordingly concludes that He made nothing out of Himself, since He never passed into such a condition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6148"></A><A HREF="#fn_6148"><FONT SIZE="1">6149</FONT></A>
 as made it possible for Him to make anything out of Himself. In like manner, he contends that He could not have made all things out of nothing&#8212;thus:&#160; He defines the Lord as a being who is good, nay, very good, who must will to make things as good and excellent as He is Himself; indeed it were impossible for Him either to will or to make anything which was not good, nay, very good itself. Therefore all things ought to have been made good and excellent by Him, after His own condition. Experience shows,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6149"></A><A HREF="#fn_6149"><FONT SIZE="1">6150</FONT></A>
 however, that things which are even evil were made by Him: not, of course, of His own will and pleasure; because, if it had been of His own will and pleasure, He would be sure to have made nothing unfitting or unworthy of Himself.&#160; That, therefore, which He made not of His own will must be understood to have been made from the fault of something, and that is from Matter, without a doubt.</p>
