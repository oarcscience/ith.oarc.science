<span id="v.iv.v.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Comparison of Christ’s Power Over
Winds and Waves with Moses’ Command of the Waters of the Red Sea and the
Jordan. Christ’s Power Over Unclean Spirits. The Case of the Legion. The
Cure of the Issue of Blood. The Mosaic Uncleanness on This Point
Explained.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xx-p2"></span>But “what manner of man is this? for He
commandeth even the winds and water!” <span
id="fr_4215"></span>[4216](#fn_4215.md) Of course He is the new master and
proprietor of the elements, now that the Creator is deposed, and
excluded from their possession! Nothing of the kind. But the elements
own <span id="fr_4216"></span>[4217](#fn_4216.md) their own Maker, just as
they had been accustomed to obey His servants also. Examine well the
Exodus, Marcion; look at the rod of Moses, as it waves His command to
the Red Sea, ampler than all the lakes of Judæa. How the sea yawns from
its very depths, then fixes itself in two solidified masses, and so, out
of the interval between them, <span id="fr_4217"></span>[4218](#fn_4217.md)
makes a way for the people to pass dry-shod across; again does the same
rod vibrate, the sea returns in its strength, and in the concourse of
its waters the chivalry of Egypt is engulphed! To that consummation the
very winds subserved!  Read, too, how that the Jordan was as a sword, to
hinder the emigrant nation in their passage across its stream; how that
its waters from above stood still, and its current below wholly ceased
to run at the bidding of Joshua, <span
id="fr_4218"></span>[4219](#fn_4218.md) when his priests began to pass
over! <span id="fr_4219"></span>[4220](#fn_4219.md) <span id="page_379">p.
379</span> <span id="v.iv.v.xx-Page_379"></span>What will you say to
this? If it be your Christ *that is meant above*, he will not be more
potent than the servants of the Creator.  But I should have been content
with the examples I have adduced without addition, <span
id="fr_4220"></span>[4221](#fn_4220.md) if a prediction of His present
passage on the sea had not preceded Christ’s coming. As psalm is, in
fact, accomplished by this <span id="fr_4221"></span>[4222](#fn_4221.md)
crossing over the lake. “The Lord,” says the psalmist, “is upon many
waters.” <span id="fr_4222"></span>[4223](#fn_4222.md) When He disperses
its waves, Habakkuk’s words are fulfilled, where he says, “Scattering
the waters in His passage.” <span id="fr_4223"></span>[4224](#fn_4223.md)
When at His rebuke the sea is calmed, Nahum is also verified: He
rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry,” <span
id="fr_4224"></span>[4225](#fn_4224.md) including the winds indeed, whereby
it was disquieted. With what evidence would you have my Christ
vindicated? Shall it come from the examples, or from the prophecies, of
the Creator? You suppose that He is predicted as a military and armed
warrior, <span id="fr_4225"></span>[4226](#fn_4225.md) instead of one who
in a figurative and allegorical sense was to wage a spiritual warfare
against spiritual enemies, in spiritual campaigns, and with spiritual
weapons: come now, when in one man alone you discover a multitude of
demons calling itself *Legion*, <span
id="fr_4226"></span>[4227](#fn_4226.md) of course comprised of spirits, you
should learn that Christ also must be understood to be an exterminator
of spiritual foes, who wields spiritual arms and fights in spiritual
strife; and that it was none other than He, <span
id="fr_4227"></span>[4228](#fn_4227.md) who now had to contend with even a
legion of demons. Therefore it is of such a war as this that the Psalm
may evidently have spoken:  “The Lord is strong, The Lord is mighty in
battle.” <span id="fr_4228"></span>[4229](#fn_4228.md) For with the last
enemy death did He fight, and through the trophy of the cross He
triumphed. Now of what God did the Legion testify that Jesus was the
Son? <span id="fr_4229"></span>[4230](#fn_4229.md) No doubt, of that God
whose torments and abyss they knew and dreaded. It seems impossible for
them to have remained up to this time in ignorance of what the power of
the recent and unknown god was working in the world, because it is very
unlikely that the Creator was ignorant thereof. For if He had been at
any time ignorant that there was another god above Himself, He had by
this time at all events discovered that there was one at work <span
id="fr_4230"></span>[4231](#fn_4230.md) below His heaven. Now, what their
Lord had discovered had by this time become notorious to His entire
family within the same world and the same circuit of heaven, in which
the strange deity dwelt and acted. <span
id="fr_4231"></span>[4232](#fn_4231.md) As therefore both the Creator and
His creatures <span id="fr_4232"></span>[4233](#fn_4232.md) must have had
knowledge of him, if he had been in existence, so, inasmuch as he had no
existence, the demons really knew none other than the Christ of their
own God. They do not ask of the strange god, what they recollected they
must beg of the Creator—not to be plunged into the Creator’s abyss. They
at last had their request granted. On what ground? Because they had
lied? Because they had proclaimed Him to be the Son of a ruthless God?
And what sort of god will that be who helped the lying, and upheld his
detractors? However, *no need of this thought*, for, <span
id="fr_4233"></span>[4234](#fn_4233.md) inasmuch as they had not lied,
inasmuch as they had acknowledged that the God of the abyss was also
their God, so did He actually Himself affirm that He was the same whom
these demons acknowledged—Jesus, the Judge and Son of the avenging God.
Now, behold an inkling <span id="fr_4234"></span>[4235](#fn_4234.md) of the
Creator’s failings <span id="fr_4235"></span>[4236](#fn_4235.md) and
infirmities in Christ; for I on my side <span
id="fr_4236"></span>[4237](#fn_4236.md) mean to impute to Him ignorance.
Allow me some indulgence in my effort against the heretic. Jesus is
touched by the woman who had an issue of blood, <span
id="fr_4237"></span>[4238](#fn_4237.md) He knew not by whom. “Who touched
me?” He asks, when His disciples alleged an excuse.  He even persists in
His assertion of ignorance: “Somebody hath touched me,” He says, and
advances some proof: “For I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.”
What says our heretic? Could *Christ* have known the person? And why did
He speak as if He were ignorant? Why? Surely it was to challenge her
faith, and to try her fear. Precisely as He had once questioned Adam, as
if in ignorance:  Adam, where art thou?” <span
id="fr_4238"></span>[4239](#fn_4238.md) Thus you have both the Creator
excused in the same way as Christ, and Christ acting similarly to <span
id="fr_4239"></span>[4240](#fn_4239.md) the Creator. But in this case He
acted as an adversary of the law; and therefore, as the law forbids
contact with a woman with an issue, <span
id="fr_4240"></span>[4241](#fn_4240.md) He desired not only that this woman
should touch Him, but that He should heal her. <span
id="fr_4241"></span>[4242](#fn_4241.md) Here, <span id="page_380">p.
380</span> <span id="v.iv.v.xx-Page_380"></span>then, is a God who is
not merciful by nature, but in hostility!  Yet, if we find that such was
the merit of this woman’s faith, that He said unto her, Thy faith hath
saved thee,” <span id="fr_4242"></span>[4243](#fn_4242.md) what are you,
that you should detect an hostility to the law in that act, which the
Lord Himself shows us to have been done as a reward of faith? But will
you have it that this faith of the woman consisted in the contempt which
she had acquired for the law? Who can suppose, that a woman who had
been. hitherto unconscious of any God, uninitiated as yet in any new
law, should violently infringe that law by which she was up to this time
bound? On what faith, indeed, was such an infringement hazarded? In what
God believing? Whom despising? The Creator?  Her touch at least was an
act of faith.  And if of faith in the Creator, how could she have
violated His law, <span id="fr_4243"></span>[4244](#fn_4243.md) when she
was ignorant of any other God?  Whatever her infringement of the law
amounted to, it proceeded from and was proportionate to her faith in the
Creator.  But how can these two things be compatible? That she violated
the law, and violated it in faith, which ought to have restrained her
from such violation? I will tell you how her faith was this above
all: <span id="fr_4244"></span>[4245](#fn_4244.md) it made her believe that
her God preferred mercy even to sacrifice; she was certain that her God
was working in Christ; she touched Him, therefore, nor as a holy man
simply, nor as a prophet, whom she knew to be capable of contamination
by reason of his human nature, but as very God, whom she assumed to be
beyond all possibility of pollution by any uncleanness. <span
id="fr_4245"></span>[4246](#fn_4245.md) She therefore, not without
reason, <span id="fr_4246"></span>[4247](#fn_4246.md) interpreted for
herself the law, as meaning that such things as are susceptible of
defilement become defiled, but not so God, whom she knew for certain to
be in Christ. But she recollected this also, that what came under the
prohibition of the law <span id="fr_4247"></span>[4248](#fn_4247.md) was
that ordinary and usual issue of blood which proceeds from natural
functions every month, and in childbirth, not that which was the result
of disordered health. Her case, however, was one of long abounding <span
id="fr_4248"></span>[4249](#fn_4248.md) ill health, for which she knew that
the succour of God’s mercy was needed, and not the *natural* relief of
time. And thus she may evidently be regarded as having discerned <span
id="fr_4249"></span>[4250](#fn_4249.md) the law, instead of breaking it.
This will prove to be the faith which was to confer intelligence
likewise. “If ye will not believe,” says (the prophet), “ye shall not
understand.” <span id="fr_4250"></span>[4251](#fn_4250.md) When Christ
approved of the faith of this woman, which simply rested in the Creator,
He declared by His answer to her, <span
id="fr_4251"></span>[4252](#fn_4251.md) that He was Himself the divine
object of the faith of which He approved. Nor can I overlook the fact
that His garment, by being touched, demonstrated also the truth of His
body; for of course” <span id="fr_4252"></span>[4253](#fn_4252.md) it was a
body, and not a phantom, which the garment clothed. <span
id="fr_4253"></span>[4254](#fn_4253.md) This indeed is not our point now;
but the remark has a natural bearing on the question we are discussing.
For if it were not a veritable body, but only a fantastic one, it could
not for certain have received contamination, as being an unsubstantial
thing. <span id="fr_4254"></span>[4255](#fn_4254.md) He therefore, who, by
reason of this vacuity of his substance, was incapable of contamination,
how could he possibly have desired this touch? <span
id="fr_4255"></span>[4256](#fn_4255.md) As an adversary of the law, his
conduct was deceitful, for he was not susceptible of a real pollution.

<span id="v.iv.v.xx-p7"></span> This obscure passage is thus read by
Oehler, from whom we have translated: “Lege extorri familiæ dirimendæ in
transitu ejus Jordanis machæram fuisse, cujus impetum atque decursum
plane et Jesus docuerat prophetis transmeantibus stare.” The *machæram*
(“sword”) is a metaphor for the *river*. Rigaltius refers to Virgil’s
figure, *Æneid*, viii. 62, 64, for a justification of the simile. Oehler
has altered the reading from the “*ex sorte*familæ,” etc., of the <span
class="sc"><span id="v.iv.v.xx-p7.2"></span>mss.</span> to
“*extorri*familiæ,” etc. The former reading would mean probably: “Read
out *of the story* of the nation how that Jordan was as a sword to
hinder their passage across its stream.” The *sorte* (or, as yet another
variation has it, “*et sortes*,” “the accounts”) meant the national
record, as we have it in the beginning of the book of Joshua. But the
passage is almost hopelessly obscure.
