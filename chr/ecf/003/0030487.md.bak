<span id="v.v.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—An Eulogy on the Wisdom and
Word of God, by Which God Made All Things of Nothing.</span>

<span id="v.v.xviii-p2"></span>If any material was necessary to God in
the creation of the world, as Hermogenes supposed, God had a far nobler
and more suitable one in His own wisdom <span
id="fr_6290"></span>[6291](#fn_6290.md) —one which was not to be gauged by
the writings of <span id="fr_6291"></span>[6292](#fn_6291.md) philosophers,
but to be learnt from the words or prophets. This alone, indeed, knew
the mind of the Lord. For “who knoweth the things of God, and the things
in God, but the Spirit, which is in Him?” <span
id="fr_6292"></span>[6293](#fn_6292.md) Now His wisdom is that Spirit. This
was His counsellor, the very way of His wisdom and knowledge. <span
id="fr_6293"></span>[6294](#fn_6293.md) Of this He made all things, making
them through It, and making them with It.  “When He prepared the
heavens,” so says (the Scripture <span
id="fr_6294"></span>[6295](#fn_6294) .md), “I was present with Him; and
when He strengthened above the winds the lofty clouds, and when He
secured the fountains <span id="fr_6295"></span>[6296](#fn_6295.md) which
are under the heaven, I was present, compacting these things <span
id="fr_6296"></span>[6297](#fn_6296.md) along with Him. I was He <span
id="fr_6297"></span>[6298](#fn_6297.md) in whom He took delight; moreover,
I daily rejoiced in His presence: for He rejoiced when He had finished
the world, and amongst the sons of men did He show forth His
pleasure.” <span id="fr_6298"></span>[6299](#fn_6298.md) Now, who would not
rather approve of <span id="fr_6299"></span>[6300](#fn_6299.md) this as the
fountain and origin of all things—of this as, in very deed, the Matter
of all Matter, not liable to any end, <span
id="fr_6300"></span>[6301](#fn_6300.md) not diverse in condition, not
restless in motion, not ungraceful in form, but natural, and proper, and
duly proportioned, and beautiful, such truly as even God might well have
required, who requires His own and not another’s? Indeed, as soon as He
perceived It to be necessary for His creation of the world, He
immediately creates It, and generates It in Himself. “The Lord,” says
the Scripture, “possessed <span id="fr_6301"></span>[6302](#fn_6301.md) me,
the beginning of His ways for the creation of His works. Before the
worlds He founded me; before He made the earth, before the mountains
were settled in their places; moreover, before the hills He generated
me, and prior to the depths was I begotten.” <span
id="fr_6302"></span>[6303](#fn_6302.md) Let Hermogenes then confess that
the very Wisdom of God is declared to be born and created, for the
especial reason that we should not suppose that there is any other being
than God alone who is unbegotten and uncreated. For if that, which from
its being inherent in the Lord <span
id="fr_6303"></span>[6304](#fn_6303.md) was of Him and in Him, was yet not
without a beginning,—I mean <span id="fr_6304"></span>[6305](#fn_6304.md)
His wisdom, which was then born and created, when in the thought of God
It began to assume motion <span id="fr_6305"></span>[6306](#fn_6305.md) for
the arrangement of His creative works,—how much more impossible <span
id="fr_6306"></span>[6307](#fn_6306.md) is it that anything should have
been without a beginning which was extrinsic to the Lord! <span
id="fr_6307"></span>[6308](#fn_6307.md) But if this same Wisdom is the Word
of God, in the capacity <span id="fr_6308"></span>[6309](#fn_6308.md) of
Wisdom, and (as being He) without whom nothing was made, just as also
(nothing) was set in order without Wisdom, how can it be that anything,
except the Father, should be older, and on this account indeed nobler,
than the Son of God, the only-begotten and first-begotten Word?  Not to
say that <span id="fr_6309"></span>[6310](#fn_6309.md) what is unbegotten
is stronger than that which is born, and what is not made more powerful
than that which is made.  Because that which did not require a Maker to
give it existence, will be much more elevated in rank than that which
had an author to bring it into being. On this principle, then, <span
id="fr_6310"></span>[6311](#fn_6310.md) if evil is indeed unbegotten,
whilst the Son of God is begotten (“for,” says God, “my heart hath
emitted my most excellent Word” <span
id="fr_6311"></span>[6312](#fn_6311) .md), I am not quite sure that evil
may not be introduced by good, the stronger by the weak, in the same way
as the unbegotten is by the begotten. Therefore on this ground
Hermogenes puts Matter even before God, by putting it before the Son.
Because the <span id="page_488">p. 488</span> <span
id="v.v.xviii-Page_488"></span>Son is the Word, and “the Word is
God,” <span id="fr_6312"></span>[6313](#fn_6312.md) and “I and my Father
are one.” <span id="fr_6313"></span>[6314](#fn_6313.md) But after all,
perhaps, <span id="fr_6314"></span>[6315](#fn_6314.md) the Son will
patiently enough submit to having that preferred before Him which (by
Hermogenes), is made equal to the Father!
