<span id="v.ix.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Sundry Popular Fears and
Prejudices. The Doctrine of the Trinity in Unity Rescued from These
Misapprehensions.</span>

<span id="v.ix.iii-p2"></span>The simple, indeed, (I will not call them
unwise and unlearned,) who always constitute <span id="page_599">p.
599</span> <span id="v.ix.iii-Page_599"></span>the majority of
believers, are startled at the dispensation <span
id="fr_7789"></span>[7790](#fn_7789) (of the Three in One.md), on the
ground that their very rule of faith withdraws them from the world’s
plurality of gods to the one only true God; not understanding that,
although He is the one only God, He must yet be believed in with His own
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ix.iii-p3.2"></span>οἰκονομία</span> .
The numerical order and distribution of the Trinity they assume to be a
division of the Unity; whereas the Unity which derives the Trinity out
of its own self is so far from being destroyed, that it is actually
supported by it. They are constantly throwing out against us that we are
preachers of two gods and three gods, while they take to themselves
pre-eminently the credit of being worshippers of the One God; just as if
the Unity itself with irrational deductions did not produce heresy, and
the Trinity rationally considered constitute the truth. We, say they,
maintain the *Monarchy* (or, *sole government* of God). <span
id="fr_7790"></span>[7791](#fn_7790.md) And so, as far as the sound goes,
do even Latins (and ignorant ones too) pronounce the word in such a way
that you would suppose their understanding of the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ix.iii-p4.1"></span>μοναρχία (</span>or
*Monarchy*) was as complete as their pronunciation of the term. Well,
then Latins take pains to pronounce the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ix.iii-p4.2"></span>μοναρχία</span> (or *Monarchy*), while Greeks
actually refuse to understand the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ix.iii-p4.3"></span>οἰκονομία</span>, or *Dispensation* (*of the
Three in One*). As for myself, however, if I have gleaned any knowledge
of either language, I am sure that <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ix.iii-p4.4"></span>μοναρχία</span> (or *Monarchy*) has no other
meaning than single and individual <span
id="fr_7791"></span>[7792](#fn_7791.md) rule; but for all that, this
monarchy does not, because it is the government of one, preclude him
whose government it is, either from having a son, or from having made
himself actually a son to himself, <span
id="fr_7792"></span>[7793](#fn_7792.md) or from ministering his own
monarchy by whatever agents he will. Nay more, I contend that no
dominion so belongs to one only, as his own, or is in such a sense
singular, or is in such a sense a monarchy, as not also to be
administered through other persons most closely connected with it, and
whom it has itself provided as officials to itself. If, moreover, there
be a son belonging to him whose monarchy it is, it does not forthwith
become divided and cease to be a monarchy, if the son also be taken as a
sharer in it; but it is as to its origin equally his, by whom it is
communicated to the son; and being his, it is quite as much a monarchy
(or *sole empire*), since it is held together by two who are so
inseparable. <span id="fr_7793"></span>[7794](#fn_7793.md) Therefore,
inasmuch as the Divine Monarchy also is administered by so many legions
and hosts of angels, according as it is written, “Thousand thousands
ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
Him;” <span id="fr_7794"></span>[7795](#fn_7794.md) and since it has not
from this circumstance ceased to be the rule of one (so as no longer to
be a monarchy), because it is administered by so many thousands of
powers; how comes it to pass that God should be thought to suffer
division and severance in the Son and in the Holy Ghost, who have the
second and the third places assigned to them, and who are so closely
joined with the Father in His substance, when He suffers no such
(division and severance) in the multitude of so many angels? Do you
really suppose that Those, who are naturally members of the Father’s own
substance, pledges of His love, <span
id="fr_7795"></span>[7796](#fn_7795.md) instruments of His might, nay, His
power itself and the entire system of His monarchy, are the overthrow
and destruction thereof? You are not right in so thinking. I prefer your
exercising yourself on the meaning of the thing rather than on the sound
of the word. Now you must understand the overthrow of a monarchy to be
*this*, when another dominion, which has a framework and a state
peculiar to itself (and is therefore a rival), is brought in over and
above it: when, *e.g.*, some other god is introduced in opposition to
the Creator, as in the opinions of Marcion; or when many gods are
introduced, according to your Valentinuses and your Prodicuses. Then it
amounts to an overthrow of the Monarchy, since it involves the
destruction of the Creator. <span id="fr_7796"></span>[7797](#fn_7796.md)
