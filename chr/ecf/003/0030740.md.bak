<span id="vi.iii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Of the Persons to Whom, and
the Time When, Baptism is to Be Administered.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xviii-p2"></span>But they whose office it is, know that
baptism is not rashly to be administered. “Give to every one who beggeth
thee,” <span id="fr_8721"></span>[8722](#fn_8721.md) has a reference of its
own, appertaining especially to almsgiving. On the contrary, this
*precept* is rather to be looked at carefully: “Give not the holy thing
to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine;” <span
id="fr_8722"></span>[8723](#fn_8722.md) and, “Lay not hands easily on
*any*; share not other men’s sins.” <span
id="fr_8723"></span>[8724](#fn_8723.md) If Philip so “easily” baptized the
chamberlain, let us reflect that a manifest and conspicuous <span
id="fr_8724"></span>[8725](#fn_8724.md) evidence that the Lord deemed him
worthy <span id="page_678">p. 678</span> <span
id="vi.iii.xviii-Page_678"></span>had been interposed. <span
id="fr_8725"></span>[8726](#fn_8725.md) The Spirit had enjoined Philip to
proceed to that road: the eunuch himself, too, was not found idle, nor
as one who was suddenly seized with an eager desire to be baptized; but,
after going up to the temple for prayer’s sake, being intently engaged
on the divine Scripture, was thus suitably discovered—to whom God had,
unasked, sent an apostle, which one, again, the Spirit bade adjoin
himself to the chamberlain’s chariot. The Scripture which *he was
reading* <span id="fr_8726"></span>[8727](#fn_8726.md) falls in opportunely
with his faith: *Philip*, being requested, is taken to sit beside him;
the Lord is pointed out; faith lingers not; water needs no waiting for;
the work is completed, and the apostle snatched away.  “But Paul too
was, in fact, ‘speedily’ baptized:” for Simon, <span
id="fr_8727"></span>[8728](#fn_8727.md) his host, speedily recognized him
to be “an appointed vessel of election.” God’s approbation sends sure
premonitory tokens before it; every “petition” <span
id="fr_8728"></span>[8729](#fn_8728.md) may both deceive and be deceived.
And so, according to the circumstances and disposition, and even age, of
each individual, the delay of baptism is preferable; principally,
however, in the case of little children. For why is it necessary—if
(baptism itself) is not so necessary <span
id="fr_8729"></span>[8730](#fn_8729.md) —that the sponsors likewise should
be thrust into danger? Who both themselves, by reason of mortality, may
fail to fulfil their promises, and may be disappointed by the
development of an evil disposition, *in those for whom they stood*? The
Lord does indeed say, “Forbid them not to come unto me.” <span
id="fr_8730"></span>[8731](#fn_8730.md) Let them “come,” then, while they
are growing up; let them “come” while they are learning, while they are
learning whither to come; <span id="fr_8731"></span>[8732](#fn_8731.md) let
them become Christians <span id="fr_8732"></span>[8733](#fn_8732.md) when
they have become able to know Christ.  Why does the innocent period of
life hasten to the “remission of sins?” More caution will be exercised
in worldly <span id="fr_8733"></span>[8734](#fn_8733.md) matters: so that
one who is *not* trusted with earthly substance *is* trusted with
divine! Let them know how to “ask” for salvation, that you may seem (at
least) to have given “to him that asketh.” <span
id="fr_8734"></span>[8735](#fn_8734.md) For no less cause must the unwedded
also be deferred—in whom *the ground of* temptation is prepared, alike
in such as *never were* wedded <span
id="fr_8735"></span>[8736](#fn_8735.md) by means of their maturity, and in
the *widowed* by means of their freedom—until they either marry, or else
be more fully strengthened for continence. If any understand the weighty
import of baptism, they will fear its reception more than its delay:
sound faith is secure of salvation.

<span id="vi.iii.xviii-p9"></span> Tertullian seems to have confused the
“Judas” with whom Saul stayed ([Acts ix.
11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011.md)<span
id="vi.iii.xviii-p9.1"></span>) with the “Simon” with whom St. Peter
stayed ([Acts ix. 43](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#043.md)<span
id="vi.iii.xviii-p9.2"></span>); and it was Ananias, not Judas, to whom
he was pointed out as “an appointed vessel,” and by whom he was
baptized. \[So above, he seems to have confounded Philip, the deacon,
with Philip the apostle.\]
