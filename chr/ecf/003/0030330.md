<span id="v.iv.ii.xvi"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Marcion Assumes the Existence
of Two Gods from the Antithesis Between Things Visible and Things
Invisible. This Antithetical Principle in Fact Characteristic of the
Works of the Creator, the One God—Maker of All Things Visible and
Invisible.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xvi-p2"></span>Since, then, that other world does not
appear, nor its god either, the only resource left <span
id="fr_2519"></span>[2520](#fn_2519) to them is to divide things into
the two classes of visible and invisible, with two gods for their
authors, and so to claim <span id="fr_2520"></span>[2521](#fn_2520) the
invisible for their own, (the supreme) God.  But who, except an
heretical spirit, could ever bring his mind to believe that the
invisible part of creation belongs to him who had previously displayed
no visible thing, rather than to Him who, by His operation on the
visible world, produced a belief in the invisible also, since it is far
more <span id="page_283">p. 283</span> <span
id="v.iv.ii.xvi-Page_283"></span>reasonable to give one’s assent after
some samples (of a work) than after none? We shall see to what author
even (your favourite) apostle attributes <span
id="fr_2521"></span>[2522](#fn_2521) the invisible creation, when we
come to examine him. At present (we withhold his testimony), for <span
id="fr_2522"></span>[2523](#fn_2522) we are for the most part engaged in
preparing the way, by means of common sense and fair arguments, for a
belief in the future support of the Scriptures also. We affirm, then,
that this diversity of things visible and invisible must on this ground
be attributed to the Creator, even because the whole of His work
consists of diversities—of things corporeal and incorporeal; of animate
and inanimate; of vocal and mute of moveable and stationary; of
productive and sterile; of arid and moist; of hot and cold. Man, too, is
himself similarly tempered with diversity, both in his body and in his
sensation. Some of his members are strong, others weak; some comely,
others uncomely; some twofold, others unique; some like, others unlike.
In like manner there is diversity also in his sensation: now joy, then
anxiety; now love, then hatred; now anger, then calmness. Since this is
the case, inasmuch as the whole of this creation of ours has been
fashioned <span id="fr_2523"></span>[2524](#fn_2523) with a reciprocal
rivalry amongst its several parts, the invisible ones are due to the
visible, and not to be ascribed to any other author than Him to whom
their counterparts are imputed, marking as they do diversity in the
Creator Himself, who orders what He forbade, and forbids what He
ordered; who also strikes and heals. Why do they take Him to be uniform
in one class of things alone, as the Creator of visible things, and only
them; whereas He ought to be believed to have created both the visible
and the invisible, in just the same way as life and death, or as evil
things and peace? <span id="fr_2524"></span>[2525](#fn_2524) And verily,
if the invisible creatures are greater than the visible, which are in
their own sphere great, so also is it fitting that the greater should be
His to whom the great belong; because neither the great, nor indeed the
greater, can be suitable property for one who seems to possess not even
the smallest things.
