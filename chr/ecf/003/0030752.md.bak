<span id="vi.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The Seventh or Final
Clause.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii-p2"></span>For the completeness of so brief a
prayer He added—in order that we should supplicate not touching the
remitting merely, but touching the entire averting, of acts of
guilt—“Lead us not into temptation:” that is, suffer us not to be led
into it, by him (of course) who tempts; but far be the thought that the
Lord should seem to tempt, <span id="fr_8815"></span>[8816](#fn_8815.md) as
if He either were ignorant of the faith of any, or else were eager to
overthrow it. Infirmity <span id="fr_8816"></span>[8817](#fn_8816.md) and
malice <span id="fr_8817"></span>[8818](#fn_8817.md) are characteristics of
the devil. For *God* had commanded even Abraham to make a sacrifice of
his son, for the sake not of tempting, but proving, his faith; in order
through him to make an example for that precept of His, whereby He was,
by and by, to enjoin that he should hold no pledges of affection dearer
than God. <span id="fr_8818"></span>[8819](#fn_8818.md) He Himself, when
tempted by the devil, demonstrated who it is that presides over and is
the originator of temptation. <span id="fr_8819"></span>[8820](#fn_8819.md)
This passage He confirms by subsequent ones, saying, “Pray that ye be
not tempted;” <span id="fr_8820"></span>[8821](#fn_8820.md) yet they *were*
tempted, (as they showed) by deserting their Lord, because they had
given way rather to sleep than prayer. <span
id="fr_8821"></span>[8822](#fn_8821.md) The final clause, therefore, is
consonant, and interprets the sense of “Lead us not into temptation;”
for this *sense* is, “But convey us away from the Evil One.”

hypothesis—ignorance.

<span id="vi.iv.viii-p5"></span> Implied in the other—wishing to
overthrow faith.

<span id="vi.iv.viii-p6"></span> i.e. no children even. The reference is
apparently to [Matt. 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#037.md), [Luke
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.iv.viii-p6.1"></span>, with which may be compared [Deut.
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md), [Deut.
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.iv.viii-p6.2"></span>. If Oehler’s reading, which I have
followed, be correct, the precept, which is not verbally given till ages
after Abraham, is made to have a retrospective force on him.

<span id="vi.iv.viii-p9"></span> Routh refers us to *De Bapt.* c. 20,
where Tertullian refers to the same event. \[Note also his reference to
*De Fuga*, cap. ii.\]
