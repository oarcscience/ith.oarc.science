<span id="v.iv.iv.v"></span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Sundry Features of the Prophetic
Style: Principles of Its Interpretation.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.v-p2"></span>These preliminary remarks I have ventured
to make <span id="fr_3142"></span>[3143](#fn_3142) at this first step of
the discussion and while the conflict is, as it were, from a distance.
But inasmuch as I shall now from this point have to grapple with my
opponent on a distinct issue and in close combat, I perceive that I must
advance even here some lines, at which the battle will have to be
delivered; they are the Scriptures of the Creator. For as I shall have
to prove that Christ was from the Creator, according to these
(Scriptures), which were afterwards accomplished in the Creator’s
Christ, I find it necessary to set forth the form and, so to speak, the
nature of the Scriptures themselves, that they may not distract the
reader’s attention by being called into controversy at the moment of
their application to subjects of discussion, and by their proof being
confounded with the proof of the subjects themselves. Now there are two
conditions of prophetic announcement which I adduce, as requiring the
assent of our adversaries in the future stages of the discussion. One,
that future events are sometimes announced as if they were already
passed. For it is <span id="fr_3143"></span>[3144](#fn_3143) consistent
with Deity to regard as accomplished facts whatever It has determined
on, because there is no difference of time with that Being in whom
eternity itself directs a uniform condition of seasons. It is indeed
more natural <span id="fr_3144"></span>[3145](#fn_3144) to the prophetic
divination to represent as seen and already brought to pass, <span
id="fr_3145"></span>[3146](#fn_3145) even while forseeing it, that which
it foresees; in other words, that which is by all means future. As for
instance, in Isaiah: “I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks (I
exposed) to their hands.  I hid not my face from shame and
spitting.” <span id="fr_3146"></span>[3147](#fn_3146) For whether it was
Christ even then, as we hold, or the prophet, as the Jews say, who
pronounced these words concerning himself, in either case, that which as
yet had not happened sounded as if it had been already accomplished.
Another characteristic will be, that very many events are figuratively
predicted by means of enigmas and allegories and parables, and that they
must be understood in a sense different from the literal description.
For we both read of “the mountains dropping down new wine,” <span
id="fr_3147"></span>[3148](#fn_3147) but not as if one might expect
“*must*” from the stones, or its decoction from the rocks; and also hear
of “a land flowing with milk and honey,” <span
id="fr_3148"></span>[3149](#fn_3148) but not as if you were to suppose
that you would ever gather Samian cakes from the ground; nor does God,
forsooth, offer His services as a water-bailiff or a farmer when He
says, “I will open rivers in a land; I will plant in the wilderness the
cedar and the box-tree.” <span id="fr_3149"></span>[3150](#fn_3149) In
like manner, when, foretelling the conversion of the Gentiles, He says,
“The beasts of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls,” He
surely never meant to derive <span id="fr_3150"></span>[3151](#fn_3150)
His fortunate omens from the young of birds and foxes, and from the
songsters of marvel and fable. But why enlarge on such a subject? When
the very apostle whom our heretics adopt, <span
id="fr_3151"></span>[3152](#fn_3151) interprets the law which allows an
unmuzzled mouth to the oxen that tread out the corn, not of cattle, but
of ourselves; <span id="fr_3152"></span>[3153](#fn_3152) and also
alleges that the rock which followed (the Israelites) and supplied them
with drink was Christ; <span id="fr_3153"></span>[3154](#fn_3153)
teaching the Galatians, moreover, that the two narratives of the sons of
Abraham had an allegorical meaning in their course; <span
id="fr_3154"></span>[3155](#fn_3154) and to the Ephesians giving an
intimation that, when it was declared in the beginning that a man should
leave his father and mother and become one flesh with his wife, he
applied this to Christ and the church. <span
id="fr_3155"></span>[3156](#fn_3155)

referred to Marcion’s acceptance of St. Paul’s epistles. It has been
suggested that Tertullian in the text uses *hæreticorum apostolus* as
synonymous with *ethnicorum apostolus*="apostle of the Gentiles,” in
which case allusion to St. Paul would of course be equally clear. But
this interpretation is unnecessary.
