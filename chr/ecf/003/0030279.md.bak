<span id="v.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Summary of the Creed, or Rule
of Faith. No Questions Ever Raised About It by Believers.  Heretics
Encourage and Perpetuate Thought Independent of Christ’s
Teaching.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p2"></span>Now, with regard to this rule of
faith—that we may from this point <span
id="fr_1993"></span>[1994](#fn_1993.md) acknowledge what it is which we
defend—it is, you must know, that which prescribes the belief that there
is one only God, and that He is none other than the Creator of the
world, who produced all things out of nothing through His own Word,
first of all sent forth; <span id="fr_1994"></span>[1995](#fn_1994.md) that
this Word is called His Son, *and*, under the name of God, was seen “in
diverse manners” by the patriarchs, heard at all times in the prophets,
at last brought down by the Spirit and Power of the Father into the
Virgin Mary, was made flesh in her womb, and, being born of her, went
forth as Jesus Christ; thenceforth He preached the new law and the new
promise of the kingdom of heaven, worked miracles; having been
crucified, He rose again the third day; (then) having ascended <span
id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995.md) into the heavens, He sat at the
right hand of the Father; sent instead of Himself <span
id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996.md) the Power of the Holy Ghost to lead
such as believe; will come with glory to take the saints to the
enjoyment of everlasting life and of the heavenly promises, and to
condemn the wicked to everlasting fire, after the resurrection of both
these classes shall have happened, together with the restoration of
their flesh. This rule, as it will be proved, was taught by Christ, and
raises amongst ourselves no other questions than those which heresies
introduce, and which make men heretics. <span
