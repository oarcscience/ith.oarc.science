<span id="v.iii.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—Heretics Not Being
Christians, But Rather Perverters of Christ’s Teaching, May Not Claim
the Christian Scriptures. These are a Deposit, Committed to and
Carefully Kept by the Church.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxxvii-p2"></span>Since this is the case, in order that
the truth may be adjudged to belong to us, “as many as walk according to
the rule,” which the church has handed down from the apostles, the
apostles from Christ, *and* Christ from God, the reason of our position
is clear, when it determines that heretics ought not to be allowed to
challenge an appeal to the Scriptures, since we, without the Scriptures,
prove that they have nothing to do with the Scriptures. For as they are
heretics, they cannot be true Christians, because it is not from Christ
that they get that which they pursue of their own mere choice, and from
the pursuit incur and admit the name of heretics. <span
id="fr_2246"></span>[2247](#fn_2246.md) Thus, not being Christians, they
have acquired <span id="fr_2247"></span>[2248](#fn_2247.md) no right to the
Christian Scriptures; and it may be very fairly said to them, “Who are
you? When and whence did you come? As you are none of mine, what have
you to do with that which is mine? Indeed, Marcion, by what right do you
hew my wood?  By whose permission, Valentinus, are you diverting the
streams of my fountain? By what power, Apelles, are you removing my
landmarks? This is my property. Why are you, the rest, sowing and
feeding here at your own pleasure?  This (I say) is my property. I have
long possessed it; I possessed it before you. I hold sure title-deeds
from the original owners themselves, to whom the estate belonged.  I am
the heir of the apostles.  Just as they carefully prepared their will
and testament, and committed it to a trust, and adjured (the trustees to
be faithful to their charge), <span id="fr_2248"></span>[2249](#fn_2248.md)
even so do I hold it. As for you, they have, it is certain, always held
you as disinherited, and rejected you as strangers—as enemies. But on
what ground are heretics strangers and enemies to the apostles, if it be
not from the difference of their teaching, which each individual of his
own mere will has either advanced or received in opposition to the
apostles?”
