<span id="v.iv.v.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Christ’s Reprehension of
the Pharisees Seeking a Sign.  His Censure of Their Love of Outward Show
Rather Than Inward Holiness. Scripture Abounds with Admonitions of a
Similar Purport. Proofs of His Mission from the Creator.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxvii-p2"></span>I prefer elsewhere refuting <span
id="fr_4574"></span>[4575](#fn_4574) the faults which the Marcionites
find in the Creator. It is here enough that they are also found in
Christ. <span id="fr_4575"></span>[4576](#fn_4575) Behold how unequal,
inconsistent, and capricious he is! Teaching one thing <span
id="page_394">p. 394</span> <span id="v.iv.v.xxvii-Page_394"></span>and
doing another, he enjoins “giving to every one that seeks;” and yet he
himself refuses to give to those “who seek a sign.” <span
id="fr_4576"></span>[4577](#fn_4576) For a vast age he hides his own
light from men, and yet says that a candle must not be hidden, but
affirms that it ought to be set upon a candlestick, that it may give
light to all. <span id="fr_4577"></span>[4578](#fn_4577) He forbids
cursing *again*, and cursing much more of course; and yet he heaps his
*woe* upon the Pharisees and doctors of the law. <span
id="fr_4578"></span>[4579](#fn_4578) Who so closely resembles my God as
His own Christ? We have often already laid it down for certain, <span
id="fr_4579"></span>[4580](#fn_4579) that He could not have been
branded <span id="fr_4580"></span>[4581](#fn_4580) as the destroyer of
the law if He had promulged another god. Therefore even the Pharisee,
who invited Him to dinner in the passage before us, <span
id="fr_4581"></span>[4582](#fn_4581) expressed some surprise <span
id="fr_4582"></span>[4583](#fn_4582) in His presence that He had not
washed before He sat down to meat, in accordance with the law, since it
was the God of the law that He was proclaiming. <span
id="fr_4583"></span>[4584](#fn_4583) Jesus also interpreted the law to
him when He told him that they “made clean the outside of the cup and
the platter, whereas their inward part was full of ravening and
wickedness.” *This He said*, to signify that by the cleansing of vessels
was to be understood before God the purification of men, inasmuch as it
was about a man, and not about an unwashed vessel, that even this
Pharisee had been treating in His presence. He therefore said: “You wash
the outside of the cup,” that is, the flesh, “but you do not cleanse
your inside part,” <span id="fr_4584"></span>[4585](#fn_4584) that is,
the soul; adding: “Did not He that made the outside,” that is, the
flesh, “also make the inward part,” that is to say, the soul?—by which
assertion He expressly declared that to the same God belongs the
cleansing of a man’s external and internal nature, both alike being in
the power of Him who prefers mercy not only to man’s washing, <span
id="fr_4585"></span>[4586](#fn_4585) but even to sacrifice. <span
id="fr_4586"></span>[4587](#fn_4586) For He subjoins the command: “Give
what ye possess as alms, and all things shall be clean unto you.” <span
id="fr_4587"></span>[4588](#fn_4587) Even if another god could have
enjoined mercy, he could not have done so previous to his becoming
known. Furthermore, it is in this passage evident that they <span
id="fr_4588"></span>[4589](#fn_4588) were not reproved concerning their
God, but concerning a point of His instruction to them, when He
prescribed to them figuratively the cleansing of their vessels, but
really the works of merciful dispositions. In like manner, He upbraids
them for tithing paltry herbs, <span
id="fr_4589"></span>[4590](#fn_4589) but at the same time “passing over
hospitality <span id="fr_4590"></span>[4591](#fn_4590) and the love of
God.” <span id="fr_4591"></span>[4592](#fn_4591) The vocation and the
love of what God, but Him by whose law of tithes they used to offer
their rue and mint? For the whole point of the rebuke lay in this, that
they cared about small matters in His service of course, to whom they
failed to exhibit their weightier duties when He commanded them: “Thou
shalt love with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
strength, the Lord thy God, who hath called thee out of Egypt.” <span
id="fr_4592"></span>[4593](#fn_4592) Besides, time enough had not yet
passed to admit of Christ’s requiring so premature—nay, as yet so
distasteful <span id="fr_4593"></span>[4594](#fn_4593) —a love towards a
new and recent, not to say a hardly yet developed, <span
id="fr_4594"></span>[4595](#fn_4594) deity. When, again, He upbraids
those who caught at the uppermost places and the honour of public
salutations, He only follows out the Creator’s course, <span
id="fr_4595"></span>[4596](#fn_4595) who calls ambitious persons of this
character “rulers of Sodom,” <span id="fr_4596"></span>[4597](#fn_4596)
who forbids us “to put confidence even in princes,” <span
id="fr_4597"></span>[4598](#fn_4597) and pronounces him to be altogether
wretched who places his confidence in man. But whoever <span
id="fr_4598"></span>[4599](#fn_4598) aims at high position, because he
would glory in the officious attentions <span
id="fr_4599"></span>[4600](#fn_4599) of other people, (in every such
case,) inasmuch as He forbade such attentions (in the shape) of placing
hope and confidence in man, He at the same time <span
id="fr_4600"></span>[4601](#fn_4600) censured all who were ambitious of
high positions. He also inveighs against the doctors of the law
themselves, because they were “lading men with burdens grievous to be
borne, which they did not venture to touch with even a finger of their
own;” <span id="fr_4601"></span>[4602](#fn_4601) but not as if He made a
mock of <span id="fr_4602"></span>[4603](#fn_4602) the burdens of the
law with any feeling of detestation towards it. For how could He have
felt aversion to the law, who used with so much earnestness to upbraid
them for passing over its weightier matters, alms—giving,
hospitality, <span id="fr_4603"></span>[4604](#fn_4603) and the love of
God? Nor, indeed, was it only these great things (which He recognized),
but even <span id="fr_4604"></span>[4605](#fn_4604) the tithes of rue
and the cleansing of cups.  But, <span id="page_395">p. 395</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxvii-Page_395"></span>in truth, He would rather have deemed
them excusable for being unable to carry burdens which could not be
borne.  What, then, are the burdens which He censures? <span
id="fr_4605"></span>[4606](#fn_4605) None but those which they were
accumulating of their own accord, when they taught for commandments the
doctrines of men; for the sake of private advantage joining house to
house, so as to deprive their neighbour of his own; cajoling <span
id="fr_4606"></span>[4607](#fn_4606) the people, loving gifts, pursuing
rewards, robbing the poor of the rights of judgment, that they might
have the widow for a prey and the fatherless for a spoil. <span
id="fr_4607"></span>[4608](#fn_4607) Of these Isaiah also says, “Woe
unto them that are strong in Jerusalem!” <span
id="fr_4608"></span>[4609](#fn_4608) and again, “They that demand you
shall rule over you.” <span id="fr_4609"></span>[4610](#fn_4609) And who
did this more than the lawyers? <span
id="fr_4610"></span>[4611](#fn_4610) Now, if these offended Christ, it
was as belonging to Him that they offended Him.  He would have aimed no
blow at the teachers of an alien law. But why is a “woe” pronounced
against them for “building the sepulchres of the prophets whom their
fathers had killed?” <span id="fr_4611"></span>[4612](#fn_4611) They
rather deserved praise, because by such an act of piety they seemed to
show that they did not allow the deeds of their fathers. Was it not
because (Christ) was jealous <span id="fr_4612"></span>[4613](#fn_4612)
of such a disposition as the Marcionites denounce, <span
id="fr_4613"></span>[4614](#fn_4613) visiting the sins of the fathers
upon the children unto the fourth generation? What “key,” indeed, was it
which these lawyers had, <span id="fr_4614"></span>[4615](#fn_4614) but
the interpretation of the law? Into the perception of this they neither
entered themselves, even because they did not believe (for “unless ye
believe, ye shall not understand”); nor did they permit others to enter,
because they preferred to teach them for commandments even the doctrines
of men. When, therefore, He reproached those who did not themselves
enter in, and also shut the door against others, must He be regarded as
a disparager of the law, or as a supporter of it? If a disparager, those
who were hindering the law ought to have been pleased; if a supporter,
He is no longer an enemy of the law. <span
id="fr_4615"></span>[4616](#fn_4615) But all these imprecations He
uttered in order to tarnish the Creator as a cruel Being, <span
id="fr_4616"></span>[4617](#fn_4616) against whom such as offended were
destined to have a “woe.” And who would not rather have feared to
provoke a cruel Being, <span id="fr_4617"></span>[4618](#fn_4617) by
withdrawing allegiance <span id="fr_4618"></span>[4619](#fn_4618) from
Him? Therefore the more He represented the Creator to be an object of
fear, the more earnestly would He teach that He ought to be served. Thus
would it behove the Creator’s Christ to act.
