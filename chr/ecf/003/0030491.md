<span id="v.v.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—This Conclusion Confirmed by the
Usage of Holy Scripture in Its History of the Creation.  Hermogenes in
Danger of the Woe Pronounced Against Adding to Scripture.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxii-p2"></span>And to such a degree has the Holy Ghost
<span id="page_490">p. 490</span> <span
id="v.v.xxii-Page_490"></span>made this the rule of His Scripture, that
whenever anything is made out of anything, He mentions both the thing
that is made and the thing of which it is made. “Let the earth,” says
He, “bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit-tree
yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself, after its kind.
And it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself,
after its kind.” <span id="fr_6337"></span>[6338](#fn_6337) And again: 
“And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
creatures that have life, and fowl that may fly above the earth through
the firmament of heaven. And it was so. And God created great whales,
and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth
abundantly, after their kind.” <span
id="fr_6338"></span>[6339](#fn_6338) Again afterwards: “And God said,
Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle,
and creeping thing, and beasts of the earth after their kind.” <span
id="fr_6339"></span>[6340](#fn_6339) If therefore God, when producing
other things out of things which had been already made, indicates them
by the prophet, and tells us what He has produced from such and such a
source <span id="fr_6340"></span>[6341](#fn_6340) (although we might
ourselves suppose them to be derived from some source or other, short of
nothing; <span id="fr_6341"></span>[6342](#fn_6341) since there had
already been created certain things, from which they might easily seem
to have been made); if the Holy Ghost took upon Himself so great a
concern for our instruction, that we might know from what everything was
produced, <span id="fr_6342"></span>[6343](#fn_6342) would He not in
like manner have kept us well informed about both the heaven and the
earth, by indicating to us what it was that He made them of, if their
original consisted of any material substance, so that the more He seemed
to have made them of nothing, the less in fact was there as yet made,
from which He could appear to have made them?  Therefore, just as He
shows us the original out of which He drew such things as were derived
from a given source, so also with regard to those things of which He
does not point out whence He produced them, He confirms (by that silence
our assertion) that they were produced out of nothing. “In the
beginning,” then, “God made the heaven and the earth.” <span
id="fr_6343"></span>[6344](#fn_6343) I revere <span
id="fr_6344"></span>[6345](#fn_6344) the fulness of His Scripture, in
which He manifests to me both the Creator and the creation. In the
gospel, moreover, I discover a Minister and Witness of the Creator, even
His Word. <span id="fr_6345"></span>[6346](#fn_6345) But whether all
things were made out of any underlying Matter, I have as yet failed
anywhere to find. Where such a statement is written, Hermogenes’
shop <span id="fr_6346"></span>[6347](#fn_6346) must tell us. If it is
nowhere written, then let it fear the *woe* which impends on all who add
to or take away from *the written word*. <span
id="fr_6347"></span>[6348](#fn_6347)
