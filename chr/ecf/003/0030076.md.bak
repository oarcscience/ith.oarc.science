<span id="iv.iv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Dress as Connected with
Idolatry.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xviii-p2"></span>But we must now treat of the garb only
and apparatus of office. There is a dress proper to every one, as well
for daily use as for office and dignity. That famous purple, therefore,
and the gold as an ornament of the neck, were, among the Egyptians and
Babylonians, ensigns of dignity, in the same way as bordered, or
striped, or palm-embroidered togas, and the golden wreaths of provincial
priests, are now; but not on the same terms. For they used only to be
conferred, under the name of *honour*, on such as deserved the familiar
friendship of kings (whence, too, such used to be styled the
“purpled-men” <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) of kings, just as
among us, <span id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) some, from their white
toga, are called “candidates” <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295) .md);
but *not* on the understanding that that garb should be tied to
*priesthoods* also, or *to any idol-ceremonies*. For if *that* were the
case, of course men of such holiness and constancy <span
id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) would instantly have refused the
defiled dresses; and it would instantly have appeared that Daniel had
been no zealous slave to idols, nor worshipped Bel, nor the dragon,
which long after *did* appear. That purple, therefore, was simple, and
used not at that time to be a mark of *dignity* <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) among the barbarians, but of
*nobility*. <span id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) For as both Joseph,
who had been a slave, and Daniel, who through <span
id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) captivity had changed his state,
attained the freedom of the states of Babylon and Egypt through the
dress of barbaric nobility; <span id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300.md) so
among us believers also, if need so be, the bordered toga will be proper
to be conceded to boys, and the stole to girls, <span
id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) as ensigns of birth, not of power; of
race, not of office; of rank, not of superstition. But the purple, or
the other ensigns of dignities and powers, dedicated from the beginning
to idolatry engrafted on the dignity and the powers, carry the spot of
their own profanation; since, moreover, bordered and striped togas, and
broad-barred ones, are put even on idols themselves; and *fasces* also,
and rods, are borne before them; and deservedly, for demons are the
magistrates of this world: they bear the *fasces* and the purples, the
ensigns of one college. What end, then, will you advance if you use the
garb indeed, but administer not the functions of it? In things unclean,
none can appear clean. If you put on a tunic defiled in itself, it
perhaps may not be defiled through you; but you, through it, will be
unable to be clean. Now by this time, you who argue about “Joseph” and
“Daniel,” know that things old and new, rude and polished, begun and
developed, slavish and free, are not always comparable. For they, even
by their circumstances, were slaves; but you, the slave of none, <span
id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md) in so far as you are the slave of
Christ alone, <span id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) who has freed you
likewise from the captivity of the world, will incur the duty of acting
after your Lord’s pattern.  That Lord walked in humility and obscurity,
with no definite home: for “the Son of man,” said He, “hath not where to
lay His head;” <span id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md) unadorned in
dress, for else He had not said, <span id="page_73">p. 73</span> <span
id="iv.iv.xviii-Page_73"></span>“Behold, they who are clad in soft
raiment are in kings’ houses:” <span id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md)
in short, inglorious in countenance and aspect, just as Isaiah withal
had fore-announced. <span id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) If, also, He
exercised no right of power even over His own followers, to whom He
discharged menial ministry; <span id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) if,
in short, though conscious of His own kingdom, <span
id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) He shrank back from being made a
king, <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) He in the fullest manner
gave His own an example for turning coldly from all the pride and garb,
as well of dignity as of power. For *if they were to be used*, who would
rather have used them than the Son of God? What kind and what number of
*fasces* would escort Him? what kind of purple would bloom from His
shoulders? what kind of gold would beam from His head, had He not judged
the glory of the world to be alien both to Himself and to His? Therefore
what He was unwilling to accept, He has rejected; what He rejected, He
has condemned; what He condemned, He has counted as part of the devil’s
pomp.  For He would not have condemned things, except such as were not
His; but things which are not God’s, can be no other’s but the devil’s.
If you have forsworn “the devil’s pomp,” <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) know that whatever there you touch is
idolatry.  Let even this fact help to remind you that all the powers and
dignities of this world are not only alien to, but enemies of, God; that
through them punishments have been determined against God’s servants;
through them, too, penalties prepared for the impious are ignored.  But
“both your birth and your substance are troublesome to you in resisting
idolatry.” <span id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) For avoiding it,
remedies cannot be lacking; since, even if they be lacking, there
remains that one by which you will be made a happier magistrate, not in
the earth, but in the heavens. <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md)
