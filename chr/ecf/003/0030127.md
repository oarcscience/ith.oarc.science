<span id="iv.vi.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.xii-p2"></span>But I first say a word also about the
crown itself. This laurel one is sacred to Apollo or Bacchus—to the
former as the god of archery, to the latter as the god of triumphs. In
like manner Claudius teaches; when he tells us that soldiers are wont
too to be wreathed in myrtle. For the myrtle belongs to Venus, the
mother of the Æneadæ, the mistress also of the god of war, who, through
Ilia and the Romuli is Roman.  But I do not believe that Venus is Roman
as well as Mars, because of the vexation the concubine gave her. <span
id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422) When military service again is crowned
with olive, the idolatry has respect to Minerva, who is equally the
goddess of arms—but got a crown of the tree referred to, because of the
peace she made with Neptune. In these respects, the superstition of the
military garland will be everywhere defiled and all-defiling. And it is
further defiled, I <span id="page_101">p. 101</span> <span
id="iv.vi.xii-Page_101"></span>should think, also in the grounds of it.
Lo the yearly public pronouncing of vows, what does that bear on its
face to be?  It takes place first in the part of the camp where the
general’s tent is, and then in the temples. In addition to the places,
observe the words also:  “We vow that you, O Jupiter, will then have an
ox with gold-decorated horns.” What does the utterance mean? Without a
doubt the denial (of Christ). Albeit the Christian says nothing in these
places with the mouth, he makes his response by having the crown on his
head. The laurel is likewise commanded (to be used) at the distribution
of the largess. So you see idolatry is not without its gain, selling, as
it does, Christ for pieces of gold, as Judas did for pieces of silver.
Will it be “Ye cannot serve God and mammon” <span
id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423) to devote your energies to mammon, and
to depart from God? Will it be “Render unto Cæsar the things which are
Cæsar’s, and unto God the things which are God’s,” <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424) not only not to render the human being
to God, but even to take the denarius from Cæsar? Is the laurel of the
triumph made of leaves, or of corpses? Is it adorned with ribbons, or
with tombs? Is it bedewed with ointments, or with the tears of wives and
mothers? It may be of some Christians too; <span
id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425) for Christ is also among the
barbarians. <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426) Has not he who has
carried (a crown for) this cause on his head, fought even against
himself?  Another son of service belongs to the royal guards. And indeed
crowns are called (Castrenses), as belonging to the camp; *Munificæ*
likewise, from the Cæsarean functions they perform. But even then you
are still the soldier and the servant of another; and if of two masters,
of God and Cæsar: but assuredly then not of Cæsar, when you owe yourself
to God, as having higher claims, I should think, even in matters in
which both have an interest.
