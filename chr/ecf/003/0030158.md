<span id="iv.viii.i.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII. <span
id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md) —Christians Charged with an Obstinate
Contempt of Death.  Instances of the Same are Found Amongst the
Heathen.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xviii-p3"></span>The rest of your charge of
obstinacy against us you sum up in this indictment, that we boldly
refuse neither your swords, nor your crosses, nor your wild beasts, nor
fire, nor tortures, such is our obduracy and contempt of death. But (you
are inconsistent in your charges); for in former times amongst your own
ancestors all these terrors have come in men’s intrepidity <span
id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md) not only to be despised, but even to
be held in great praise. How many swords there were, and what brave men
were willing to suffer by them, it were irksome to enumerate. <span
id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733) (If we take the torture.md) of the cross,
of which so many instances have occurred, exquisite in cruelty, your own
Regulus readily initiated the suffering which up to his day was without
a precedent; <span id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md) a queen of Egypt
used wild beasts of her own (to accomplish her death); <span
id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md) the Carthaginian woman, who in the
last extremity of her country was more courageous than her husband
Asdrubal, <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736.md) only followed the
example, set long before by Dido herself, of going through fire to her
death. Then, again, a woman of Athens defied the tyrant, exhausted his
tortures, and at last, lest her person and sex might succumb through
weakness, she bit off her tongue and spat out of her mouth the only
possible instrument of a confession which was now out of her
power. <span id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737.md) But in your own instance
you account such deeds glorious, in ours obstinate.  Annihilate now the
glory of your ancestors, in order that you may thereby annihilate us
also. Be content from henceforth to repeal the praises of your
forefathers, in order that you may not have to accord commendation to us
for the same (sufferings). Perhaps (you will say) the character of a
more robust age may have rendered the spirits of antiquity more
enduring. Now, however, (we enjoy) the blessing of quietness and peace;
so that the minds and dispositions of men (should be) more tolerant even
towards strangers. Well, you rejoin, be it so: *you* may compare
*yourselves* with the ancients; *we* must needs pursue with hatred all
that we find in you offensive to *ourselves*, because it does not obtain
currency <span id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738.md) among us. Answer me,
then, on each particular case by itself. I am not seeking for examples
on a uniform scale. <span id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739.md) Since,
forsooth, the sword through their contempt of death produced stories of
heroism amongst your ancestors, it is not, of course, <span
id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md) from love of life that you go to the
trainers sword in hand and offer yourselves as gladiators, <span
id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741) (nor.md) through fear of death do you
enrol your names in the army. <span id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742.md)
Since an ordinary <span id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md) woman makes
her death famous by wild beasts, it cannot but be of your own pure
accord that you encounter wild beasts day after day in the midst of
peaceful times. Although no longer any Regulus among you has raised a
cross as the instrument of his own crucifixion, yet a contempt of the
fire has even now displayed itself, <span
id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744.md) since one of yourselves very lately
has offered for a wager <span id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745.md) to go to
any place which may be fixed upon and put on the burning shirt. <span
id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746.md) If a woman once defiantly danced
beneath the scourge, the same feat has been very recently performed
again by one of your own (circus-) hunters <span
id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747.md) as he traversed the <span
id="page_127">p. 127</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.xviii-Page_127"></span>appointed course, not to mention
the famous sufferings of the Spartans. <span
id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md)
