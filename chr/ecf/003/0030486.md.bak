<span id="v.v.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—The Truth of God’s Work in
Creation. You Cannot Depart in the Least from It, Without Landing
Yourself in an Absurdity.</span>

<span id="v.v.xvii-p2"></span>This rule is required by the nature of the
One-only God, <span id="fr_6286"></span>[6287](#fn_6286.md) who is One-only
in no other way than as the sole God; and in no other way sole, than as
having nothing else (co-existent) with Him. So also He will be first,
because all things are after Him; and all things are after Him, because
all things are by Him; and all things are by Him, because they are of
nothing: so that reason coincides with the Scripture, which says: “Who
hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? or
with whom took He counsel? or who hath shown to Him the way of wisdom
and knowledge? Who hath first given to <span id="page_487">p. 487</span>
<span id="v.v.xvii-Page_487"></span>Him, and it shall be recompensed to
him again?” <span id="fr_6287"></span>[6288](#fn_6287.md) Surely none! 
Because there was present with Him no power, no material, no nature
which belonged to any other than Himself.  But if it was with some
(portion of Matter) <span id="fr_6288"></span>[6289](#fn_6288.md) that He
effected His creation, He must have received from that (Matter) itself
both the design and the treatment of its order as being “the way of
wisdom and knowledge.” For He had to operate conformably with the
quality of the thing, and according to the nature of Matter, not
according to His own will in consequence of which He must have
made <span id="fr_6289"></span>[6290](#fn_6289.md) even evil things
suitably to the nature not of Himself, but of Matter.
