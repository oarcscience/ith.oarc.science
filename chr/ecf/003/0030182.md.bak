<span id="iv.ix.i-p4"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="iv.ix.i-p4.1"></span>\[Translated by the Rev. S. Thelwall.\]</span>

<span id="iv.ix.i-p5"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv.ix.i-p6"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iv.ix.i-p6.1"></span>Chapter I.—Occasion of Writing. Relative
Position of Jews and Gentiles Illustrated.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.i-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ix.i-p7.1"></span>It</span> happened very recently a dispute was
held between a Christian and a Jewish proselyte. Alternately with
contentious cable they each spun out the day until evening. By the
opposing din, moreover, of some partisans of the individuals, truth
began to be overcast by a sort of cloud. It was therefore our pleasure
that that which, owing to the confused noise of disputation, could be
less fully elucidated point by point, should be more carefully looked
into, and that the pen should determine, for reading purposes, the
questions handled.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p8"></span>For the occasion, indeed, of claiming
Divine grace even for the Gentiles derived a pre-eminent fitness from
this fact, that the man who set up to vindicate God’s Law as his own was
of the Gentiles, and not a Jew “of the stock of the Israelites.” <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md) For this fact—that Gentiles are
admissible to God’s Law—is enough to prevent Israel from priding himself
on the notion that “the Gentiles are accounted as a little drop of a
bucket,” or else as “dust out of a threshing-floor:” <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127.md) although we have God Himself as an
adequate engager and faithful promiser, in that He promised to Abraham
that “in his seed should be blest all nations of the earth;” <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128.md) and that <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129.md) out of the womb of Rebecca “two
peoples and two nations were about to proceed,” <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[1131](#fn_1130.md) —of course those of the Jews, that
is, of Israel; and of the Gentiles, that is ours. Each, then, was called
a *people* and a *nation*; lest, from the nuncupative appellation, any
should dare to claim for himself the privilege of grace.  For God
ordained “two peoples and two nations” as about to proceed out of the
womb of one woman: nor did grace <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131.md) make distinction in the nuncupative
appellation, but in the order of birth; to the effect that, which ever
was to be prior in proceeding from the womb, should be subjected to “the
less,” that is, the posterior. For thus unto Rebecca did God speak: “Two
nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided from thy
bowels; and people shall overcome people, and the greater shall serve
the less.” <span id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132.md) Accordingly, since
the *people* or *nation* of the Jews is anterior in time, and “greater”
through the grace of primary favour in the Law, whereas ours is
understood to be “less” in the age of times, as having in the last era
of the world <span id="fr_1133"></span>[1134](#fn_1133.md) attained the
knowledge of divine mercy:  beyond doubt, through the edict of the
divine utterance, the *prior* and “greater” people—that is, the
Jewish—must necessarily serve the “less;” and the “less” people—that is,
the Christian—overcome the “greater.” For, withal, according to the
memorial records of the divine Scriptures, the *people* of the Jews—that
is, the more ancient—quite forsook God, and did degrading service to
idols, and, abandoning the Divinity, was surrendered to images; while
“the people” said to Aaron, “Make us gods to go before us.” <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134.md) And when the gold out of the
necklaces of the women and the rings of <span id="page_152">p.
152</span> <span id="iv.ix.i-Page_152"></span>the men had been wholly
smelted by fire, and there had come forth a calf-like head, to this
figment Israel with one consent (abandoning God) gave honour, saying,
“These are the gods who brought us from the land of Egypt.” <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135.md) For thus, in the later times in
which kings were governing them, did they again, in conjunction with
Jeroboam, worship golden kine, and groves, and enslave themselves to
Baal. <span id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136.md) Whence is proved that
they have ever been depicted, out of the volume of the divine
Scriptures, as guilty of the crime of idolatry; whereas our “less”—that
is, posterior—*people*, quitting the idols which formerly it used
slavishly to serve, has been converted to the same God from whom Israel,
as we have above related, had departed. <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137.md) For thus has the “less”—that is,
posterior—*people* overcome the “greater people,” while it attains the
grace of divine favour, from which Israel has been divorced.

id="iv.ix.i-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.i-p3"></span> \[This treatise was written while our
author was a Catholic.  This seems to me the best supported of the
theories concerning it. Let us accept Pamelius, for once and date it
<span class="sc"><span id="iv.ix.i-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 198. Dr.
Allix following Baronius, will have it as late as <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ix.i-p3.3"></span>a.d.</span> 208. Neander thinks the work, after
the quotation from Isaiah in the beginning of chapter ninth, *is not our
author’s*, but was finished by another hand, clumsily annexing what is
said on the same chapter of Isaiah in the Third Book against Marcion. It
is only slightly varied. Bp. Kaye admits the very striking facts
instanced by Neander, in support of this theory, but demolishes, with a
word any argument drawn from thence that the genuine work was written
after the author’s lapse. This treatise is sufficiently annotated by
Thelwall, and covers ground elsewhere gone over in this Series. My own
notes are therefore very few.\]
