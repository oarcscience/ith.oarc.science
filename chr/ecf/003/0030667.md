<span id="v.ix.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—The Scriptures Relied on by Praxeas
to Support His Heresy But Few. They are Mentioned by Tertullian.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xx-p2"></span>But I must take some further pains to rebut
their arguments, when they make selections from the Scriptures in
support of their opinion, and refuse to consider the other points, which
obviously maintain the rule of faith without any infraction of the unity
of the Godhead, and with the full admission <span
id="fr_8004"></span>[8005](#fn_8004) of the Monarchy. For as in the Old
Testament Scriptures they lay hold of nothing else than, “I am God, and
beside me there is no God;” <span id="fr_8005"></span>[8006](#fn_8005)
so in the Gospel they simply keep in view the Lord’s answer to Philip,
“I and my Father are one;” <span id="fr_8006"></span>[8007](#fn_8006)
and, “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and I am in the Father,
and the Father in me.” <span id="fr_8007"></span>[8008](#fn_8007) They
would have the entire revelation of both Testaments yield to these three
passages, whereas the only proper course is to understand the few
statements in the light of the many. But in their contention they only
act on the principle of all heretics. For, inasmuch as only a few
testimonies are to be found (making for them) in the general mass, they
pertinaciously set off the few against the many, and assume the later
against the earlier. The rule, however, which has been from the
beginning established for every case, gives its prescription against the
later *assumptions*, as indeed it also does against the fewer.
