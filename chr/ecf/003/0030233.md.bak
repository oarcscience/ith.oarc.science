<span id="iv.xi.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—The Pythagorean Doctrine
Refuted by Its Own First Principle, that Living Men are Formed from the
Dead.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xxix-p2"></span>It is indeed, manifest that dead men are
formed from living ones; but it does not follow from that, that living
men are formed from dead ones. For from the beginning the living came
first in the order of things, and therefore also from the beginning the
dead came afterwards in order. But these proceeded from no other source
except from the living. The living had their origin in any other source
(you please) than in the dead; whilst the dead had no source whence to
derive their beginning, except from the living. <span id="page_210">p.
210</span> <span id="iv.xi.xxix-Page_210"></span>If, then, from the very
first the living came not from the dead, why should they afterwards (be
said to) come from the dead? Had that original source, whatever it was,
come to an end? Was the form or law thereof a matter for regret? Then
why was it preserved in the case of the dead? Does it not follow that,
because the dead came from the living at the first, therefore they
always came from the living? For either the law which obtained at the
beginning must have continued in both of its relations, or else it must
have changed in both; so that, if it had become necessary for the living
afterwards to proceed from the dead, it would be necessary, in like
manner, for the dead also not to proceed from the living. For if a
faithful adherence to the institution was not meant to be perpetuated in
each respect, then contraries cannot in due alternation continue to be
re-formed from contraries. We, too, will on our side adduce against you
certain contraries, of the born and the unborn, of vision <span
id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709.md) and blindness, of youth and old
age, of wisdom and folly. Now it does not follow that the unborn
proceeds from the born, on the ground that a contrary issues from a
contrary; nor, again, that vision proceeds from blindness, because
blindness happens to vision; nor, again, that youth revives from old
age, because after youth comes the decrepitude of senility; nor that
folly <span id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710.md) is born with its
obtuseness from wisdom, because wisdom may possibly be sometimes
sharpened out of folly.  Albinus has some fears for his (master and
friend) Plato in these points, and labours with much ingenuity to
distinguish different kinds of contraries; as if these instances did not
as absolutely partake of the nature of contrariety as those which are
expounded by him to illustrate his great master’s principle—I mean, life
and death.  Nor is it, for the matter of that, true that life is
restored out of death, because it happens that death succeeds <span
id="fr_1711"></span>[1712](#fn_1711.md) life.
