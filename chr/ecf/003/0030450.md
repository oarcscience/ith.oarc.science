<span id="v.iv.vi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Another Instance of Marcion’s
Tampering with St. Paul’s Text.  The Fulness of Time, Announced by the
Apostle, Foretold by the Prophets. Mosaic Rites Abrogated by the Creator
Himself. Marcion’s Tricks About Abraham’s Name. The Creator, by His
Christ, the Fountain of the Grace and the Liberty Which St. Paul
Announced. Marcion’s Docetism Refuted.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.iv-p2"></span>“But,” says he, “I speak after the
manner of men: when we were children, we were placed in bondage under
the elements of the world.” <span id="fr_5321"></span>[5322](#fn_5321.md)
This, however, was not said “after the manner of men.” For there is no
figure <span id="fr_5322"></span>[5323](#fn_5322.md) here, but literal
truth. For (with respect to the latter clause of this passage), what
child (in the sense, that is, in which the Gentiles are children) is not
in bondage to the elements of the world, which he looks up to <span
id="fr_5323"></span>[5324](#fn_5323.md) in the light of a god? With regard,
however, to the former clause, there *was* a figure (as the apostle
wrote it); because after he had said, “I speak after the manner of men,”
he adds), “Though it be but a man’s covenant, no man disannulleth, or
addeth thereto.” <span id="fr_5324"></span>[5325](#fn_5324.md) For by the
figure of the permanency of a human covenant he was defending the divine
testament. “To Abraham were the promises made, and to his seed. He said
not ‘to seeds,’ as of many; but as of one, ‘to thy seed,’ which is
Christ.” <span id="fr_5325"></span>[5326](#fn_5325.md) Fie on <span
id="fr_5326"></span>[5327](#fn_5326.md) Marcion’s sponge! But indeed it is
superfluous to dwell on what he has erased, when he may be more
effectually confuted from that which he has retained. <span
id="fr_5327"></span>[5328](#fn_5327.md) “But when the fulness of time was
come, God sent forth His Son” <span id="fr_5328"></span>[5329](#fn_5328.md)
—the God, of course, who is the Lord of that <span id="page_436">p.
436</span> <span id="v.iv.vi.iv-Page_436"></span>very succession of
times which constitutes *an age*; who also ordained, as “*signs*” of
time, suns and moons and constellations and stars; who furthermore both
predetermined and predicted that the revelation of His Son should be
postponed to the end of the times. <span
id="fr_5329"></span>[5330](#fn_5329.md) “It shall come to pass *in the last
days*, that the mountain (of the house) of the Lord shall be
manifested”; <span id="fr_5330"></span>[5331](#fn_5330.md) “and *in the
last days* I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh” <span
id="fr_5331"></span>[5332](#fn_5331.md) as Joel says. It was characteristic
of Him (only) <span id="fr_5332"></span>[5333](#fn_5332.md) to wait
patiently for the fulness of time, to whom belonged the end of time no
less than the beginning. But as for that idle god, who has neither any
work nor any prophecy, nor accordingly any time, to show for himself,
what has *he* ever done to bring about the fulness of time, or to wait
patiently its completion? If nothing, what an impotent state to have to
wait for the Creator’s time, in servility to the Creator! But for what
end did He send His Son? “To redeem them that were under the law,” <span
id="fr_5333"></span>[5334](#fn_5333.md) in other words, to “make the
crooked ways straight, and the rough places smooth,” as Isaiah
says <span id="fr_5334"></span>[5335](#fn_5334.md) —in order that old
things might pass away, and a new course begin, even “the new law out of
Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem,” <span
id="fr_5335"></span>[5336](#fn_5335.md) and “that we might receive the
adoption of sons,” <span id="fr_5336"></span>[5337](#fn_5336.md) that is,
the Gentiles, who once were not sons.  For He is to be “the light of the
Gentiles,” and “in His name shall the Gentiles trust.” <span
id="fr_5337"></span>[5338](#fn_5337.md) That we may have, therefore the
assurance that we are the children of God, “He hath sent forth His
Spirit into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.” <span
id="fr_5338"></span>[5339](#fn_5338.md) For “in the last days,” saith He,
“I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.” <span
id="fr_5339"></span>[5340](#fn_5339.md)

<span id="v.iv.vi.iv-p22"></span>Now, from whom comes this grace, but
from Him who proclaimed the promise thereof? Who is (our) Father, but He
who is also our Maker?  Therefore, after such affluence (of grace), they
should not have returned “to weak and beggarly elements.” <span
id="fr_5340"></span>[5341](#fn_5340.md) By the Romans, however, the
rudiments of learning are wont to be called *elements*. He did not
therefore seek, by any depreciation of the mundane elements, to turn
them away from their god, although, when he said just before, “Howbeit,
then, ye serve them which by nature are no gods,” <span
id="fr_5341"></span>[5342](#fn_5341.md) he censured the error of that
physical or natural superstition which holds the elements to be god; but
at the God of those elements he aimed not in this censure. <span
id="fr_5342"></span>[5343](#fn_5342.md) He tells us himself clearly enough
what he means by “*elements*,” even the rudiments of the law: “Ye
observe days, and months, and times, and years” <span
id="fr_5343"></span>[5344](#fn_5343.md) —the sabbaths, I suppose, and “the
preparations,” <span id="fr_5344"></span>[5345](#fn_5344.md) and the fasts,
and the “high days.” <span id="fr_5345"></span>[5346](#fn_5345.md) For the
cessation of even these, no less than of circumcision, was appointed by
the Creator’s decrees, who had said by Isaiah, “Your new moons, and your
sabbaths, and your high days I cannot bear; your fasting, and feasts,
and ceremonies my soul hateth;” <span
id="fr_5346"></span>[5347](#fn_5346.md) also by Amos, “I hate, I despise
your feast-days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies;” <span
id="fr_5347"></span>[5348](#fn_5347.md) and again by Hosea, “I will cause
to cease all her mirth, and her feast-days, and her sabbaths, and her
new moons, and all her solemn assemblies.” <span
id="fr_5348"></span>[5349](#fn_5348.md) The institutions which He set up
Himself, you ask, did He then destroy? Yes, rather than any other. Or if
another destroyed them, he only helped on the purpose of the Creator, by
removing what even He had condemned. But this is not the place to
discuss the question why the Creator abolished His own laws. It is
enough for us to have proved that He intended such an abolition, that so
it may be affirmed that the apostle determined nothing to the prejudice
of the Creator, since the abolition itself proceeds from the Creator.
But as, in the case of thieves, something of the stolen goods is apt to
drop by the way, as a clue to their detection; so, as it seems to me, it
has happened to Marcion: the last mention of Abraham’s name he has left
untouched (in the epistle), although no passage required his erasure
more than this, even his partial alteration of the text. <span
id="fr_5349"></span>[5350](#fn_5349) “For (it is written.md) that Abraham
had two sons, the one by a bond maid, the other by a free woman; but he
who was of the bond maid was born after the flesh, but he of the free
woman was by promise: which things are allegorized” <span
id="fr_5350"></span>[5351](#fn_5350.md) (that is to say, they presaged
something besides *the literal history*); “for these are the <span
id="page_437">p. 437</span> <span id="v.iv.vi.iv-Page_437"></span>two
covenants,” or the two exhibitions (of the divine plans), <span
id="fr_5351"></span>[5352](#fn_5351.md) as we have found the word
interpreted, “the one from the Mount Sinai,” in relation to the
synagogue of the Jews, according to the law, “which gendereth to
bondage”—“the other gendereth” (to liberty, being raised) above all
principality, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not
only in this world, but in that which is to come, “which is the mother
of us all,” in which we have the promise of (Christ’s) holy church; by
reason of which he adds in conclusion: “So then, brethren, we are not
children of the bond woman, but of the free.” <span
id="fr_5352"></span>[5353](#fn_5352.md) In this passage he has undoubtedly
shown that Christianity had a noble birth, being sprung, as the mystery
of the allegory indicates, from that son of Abraham who was born of the
free woman; whereas from the son of the bond maid came the legal bondage
of Judaism. Both dispensations, therefore, emanate from that same God by
whom, <span id="fr_5353"></span>[5354](#fn_5353.md) as we have found, they
were both sketched out beforehand. When he speaks of “the liberty
wherewith Christ hath made us free,” <span
id="fr_5354"></span>[5355](#fn_5354.md) does not the very phrase indicate
that He is the Liberator who was once the Master? For Galba himself
never liberated slaves which were not his own, even when about to
restore free men to their liberty. <span
id="fr_5355"></span>[5356](#fn_5355.md) By Him, therefore, will liberty be
bestowed, at whose command lay the enslaving power of the law. And very
properly. It was not meet that those who had received liberty should be
“entangled again with the yoke of bondage” <span
id="fr_5356"></span>[5357](#fn_5356.md) —that is, of the law; now that the
Psalm had its prophecy accomplished: “Let us break their bands asunder,
and cast away their cords from us, since the rulers have gathered
themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ.” <span
id="fr_5357"></span>[5358](#fn_5357.md) All those, therefore, who had been
delivered from the yoke of slavery he would earnestly have to obliterate
the very mark of slavery—even circumcision, on the authority of the
prophet’s prediction. He remembered how that Jeremiah had said,
“Circumcise the foreskins of your heart;” <span
id="fr_5358"></span>[5359](#fn_5358.md) as Moses likewise had enjoined,
“Circumcise your hard hearts” <span id="fr_5359"></span>[5360](#fn_5359.md)
—not the *literal* flesh. If, now, he were for excluding circumcision,
as the messenger of a new god, why does he say that “in Christ neither
circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision?” <span
id="fr_5360"></span>[5361](#fn_5360.md) For it was his duty to prefer the
rival principle of that which he was abolishing, if he had a mission
from the god who was the enemy of circumcision.

<span id="v.iv.vi.iv-p44"></span>Furthermore, since both circumcision
and uncircumcision were attributed to the same Deity, both lost their
power <span id="fr_5361"></span>[5362](#fn_5361.md) in Christ, by reason of
the excellency of faith—of that faith concerning which it had been
written, “And in His name shall the Gentiles trust?” <span
id="fr_5362"></span>[5363](#fn_5362.md) —of that faith “which,” he says
“worketh by love.” <span id="fr_5363"></span>[5364](#fn_5363.md) By this
saying he also shows that the Creator is the source of that grace. For
whether he speaks of the love which is due to God, or that which is due
to one’s neighbor—in either case, the Creator’s grace is meant: for it
is He who enjoins the first in these words, “Thou shalt love God with
all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
strength;” <span id="fr_5364"></span>[5365](#fn_5364.md) and also the
second in another passage:  “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself.” <span id="fr_5365"></span>[5366](#fn_5365.md) “But he that
troubleth you shall have to bear judgment.” <span
id="fr_5366"></span>[5367](#fn_5366) From what God? From (Marcion’s.md)
most excellent god? But he does not execute judgment. From the Creator?
But neither will He condemn the maintainer of circumcision. Now, if none
other but the Creator shall be found to execute judgment, it follows
that only He, who has determined on the cessation of the law, shall be
able to condemn the defenders of the law; and what, if he also affirms
the law in that portion of it where it ought (to be permanent)? “For,”
says he, “all the law is fulfilled in you by this:  ‘Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself.’” <span id="fr_5367"></span>[5368](#fn_5367.md) If,
indeed, he will have it that by the words “*it is fulfilled*” it is
implied that the law no longer has *to be* fulfilled, then of course he
does not mean that I should any more love my neighbour as myself, since
this precept must have ceased together with the law. But no! we must
evermore continue to observe this commandment. The Creator’s law,
therefore, has received the approval of the rival god, who has, in fact,
bestowed upon it not the sentence of a summary dismissal, <span
id="fr_5368"></span>[5369](#fn_5368.md) but the favour of a compendious
acceptance; <span id="fr_5369"></span>[5370](#fn_5369.md) <span
id="page_438">p. 438</span> <span id="v.iv.vi.iv-Page_438"></span>the
gist of it all being concentrated in this one precept! But this
condensation of the law is, in fact, only possible to Him who is the
Author of it.  When, therefore, he says, “Bear ye one another’s burdens,
and so fulfill the law of Christ,” <span
id="fr_5370"></span>[5371](#fn_5370.md) since this cannot be accomplished
except a man love his neighbour as himself, it is evident that the
precept, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (which, in fact,
underlies the injunction, “Bear ye one another’s burdens”), is really
“the law of Christ,” though literally the law of the Creator. Christ,
therefore, is the Creator’s Christ, as Christ’s law is the Creator’s
law.  “Be not deceived, <span id="fr_5371"></span>[5372](#fn_5371.md) God
is not mocked.” <span id="fr_5372"></span>[5373](#fn_5372.md) But Marcion’s
god *can* be mocked; for he knows not how to be angry, or how to take
vengeance. “For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” <span
id="fr_5373"></span>[5374](#fn_5373.md) It is then the God of recompense
and judgment who threatens <span id="fr_5374"></span>[5375](#fn_5374.md)
this. “Let us not be weary in well-doing;” <span
id="fr_5375"></span>[5376](#fn_5375.md) and “as we have opportunity, let us
do good.” <span id="fr_5376"></span>[5377](#fn_5376.md) Deny now that the
Creator has given a commandment to do good, and then a diversity of
precept may argue a difference of gods. If, however, He also announces
recompense, then from the same God must come the harvest both of
death <span id="fr_5377"></span>[5378](#fn_5377.md) and of life. But “in
due time we shall reap;” <span id="fr_5378"></span>[5379](#fn_5378.md)
because in Ecclesiastes it is said, “For everything there will be a
time.” <span id="fr_5379"></span>[5380](#fn_5379.md) Moreover, “the world
is crucified unto me,” who am a servant of the Creator—“the world,” (I
say,) but not the God who made the world—“and I unto the world,” <span
id="fr_5380"></span>[5381](#fn_5380.md) not unto the God who made the
world. *The world*, in the apostle’s sense, here means life and
conversation according to worldly principles; it is in renouncing these
that we and they are mutually crucified and mutually slain. He calls
them “persecutors of Christ.” <span id="fr_5381"></span>[5382](#fn_5381.md)
But when he adds, that “he bare in his body the *scars* <span
id="fr_5382"></span>[5383](#fn_5382.md) of Christ”—since scars, of course,
are accidents of body <span id="fr_5383"></span>[5384](#fn_5383.md) —he
therefore expressed the truth, that the flesh of Christ is not putative,
but real and substantial, <span id="fr_5384"></span>[5385](#fn_5384.md) the
scars of which he represents as borne upon his body.

id="v.iv.vi.iv-p2.2"></span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.iv-p3"></span> This apparent quotation is in fact a
patching together of two sentences from [Gal.
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015.md), [Gal.
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md)<span id="v.iv.vi.iv-p3.1"></span>
(Fr. Junius). “If I may be allowed to guess from the manner in which
Tertullian expresseth himself, I should imagine that Marcion erased the
whole of chap. iii. after the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.vi.iv-p3.2"></span>λέγω</span> in [Gal.
3.15-4.3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.iv.vi.iv-p3.3"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.vi.iv-p3.4"></span></span>. Then the words will be connected
thus: ‘Brethren, I speak after the manner of men…when we were children
we were in bondage under the elements of the world; but when the fulness
of time was come, God sent forth His Son.’ This is precisely what the
argument of Tertullian requires, and they are the very words which he
connects together” (Lardner, *Hist. of Heretics*, x. 43). Dr. Lardner,
touching Marcion’s omissions in this chap. iii. of the Epistle to the
Galatians, says: “He omitted [Gal.
3.6-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#006.md)<span
id="v.iv.vi.iv-p3.5"></span>, in order to get rid of the mention of
Abraham, and of the gospel having been preached to him.” This he said
after St. Jerome, and then adds: “He ought also to have omitted part of
[Gal. 3.9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#009.md)<span
id="v.iv.vi.iv-p3.6"></span>, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.vi.iv-p3.7"></span>σὺν τῷ πιστῷ ᾽Αβραάμ</span>, which seems to
have been the case, according to T.’s manner of stating the argument
against him” (Works, *History of Heretics*, x. 43).

This, of course, is consistent in St. Paul’s argument. Marcion, however,
by erasing all the intervening verses, and affixing the phrase “*after
the manner of men*” to the plain assertion of [Gal. iv.
3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md)<span id="v.iv.vi.iv-p6.2"></span>,

illustration.
