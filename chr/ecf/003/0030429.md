id="v.iv.v.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Parables of the Mustard-Seed,
and of the Leaven. Transition to the Solemn Exclusion Which Will Ensue
When the Master of the House Has Shut the Door. This Judicial Exclusion
Will Be Administered by Christ, Who is Shown Thereby to Possess the
Attribute of the Creator.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxx-p2"></span>When the question was again raised
concerning a cure performed on the Sabbath-day, how did He discuss it:
“Doth not each of you on the Sabbath loose his ass or his ox from the
stall, and lead him away to watering?” <span
id="fr_4708"></span>[4709](#fn_4708) When, therefore, He did a work
according to the condition prescribed by the law, He affirmed, instead
of breaking, the law, which commanded that no work should be done,
except what might be done for any living being; <span
id="fr_4709"></span>[4710](#fn_4709) *and if for any one*, then how much
more for a *human* life? In the case of the parables, it is allowed that
I <span id="fr_4710"></span>[4711](#fn_4710) everywhere require a
congruity. “The kingdom of God,” says He, “is like a grain of
mustard-seed which a man took and cast into his garden.” Who must be
understood as meant by the *man*? Surely Christ, because (although
Marcion’s) he was called “the Son of man.” He received from the Father
the seed of the kingdom, that is, the word of the gospel, and sowed it
in his garden—in the world, of course <span
id="fr_4711"></span>[4712](#fn_4711) —in man at the present day, for
instance. <span id="fr_4712"></span>[4713](#fn_4712) Now, whereas it is
said, “*in his garden*,” but neither the world nor man is his property,
but the Creator’s, therefore He who sowed seed in His own ground is
shown to be the Creator.  Else, if, to evade this snare, <span
id="fr_4713"></span>[4714](#fn_4713) they should choose to transfer the
person of *the man* from Christ to any person who receives the seed of
the kingdom and sows it in the garden of his own heart, not even this
meaning <span id="fr_4714"></span>[4715](#fn_4714) would suit any other
than the Creator.  For how happens it, if the kingdom belong to the most
lenient god, that it is closely followed up by a fervent judgment, the
severity of which brings weeping? <span
id="fr_4715"></span>[4716](#fn_4715) With regard, indeed, to the
following similitude, I have my fears lest it should somehow <span
id="fr_4716"></span>[4717](#fn_4716) presage the kingdom of the rival
god!  For He compared it, not to the unleavened bread which the Creator
is more familiar with, but to *leaven*. <span
id="fr_4717"></span>[4718](#fn_4717) Now this is a capital conjecture
for men who are begging for arguments. I must, however, on my side,
dispel one fond conceit by another, <span
id="fr_4718"></span>[4719](#fn_4718) and contend with even *leaven* is
suitable for the kingdom of the Creator, because after it comes *the
oven*, or, if you please, <span id="fr_4719"></span>[4720](#fn_4719) the
furnace of hell. How often has He already displayed Himself as a Judge,
and in the Judge the Creator? How often, indeed, has He repelled, and in
the repulse condemned? In the present passage, for instance, He says,
“When once the master of the house is risen up;” <span
id="fr_4720"></span>[4721](#fn_4720) but in what sense except that in
which Isaiah said, “When He ariseth to shake terribly the earth?” <span
id="fr_4721"></span>[4722](#fn_4721) “And hath shut to the door,”
thereby shutting out the wicked, of course; and when these knock, He
will answer, “I know you not whence ye are;” and when they recount how
“they have eaten and drunk in His presence,” He will further say to
them, “Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.” <span
id="fr_4722"></span>[4723](#fn_4722) But where?  Outside, no doubt, when
they shall have been excluded with the door shut on them by Him. There
will therefore be punishment inflicted by Him who excludes for
punishment, when they shall behold the righteous entering the kingdom of
God, but themselves detained without. By whom detained outside? If by
the Creator, who shall be *within* receiving the righteous into the
kingdom? The good God. What, therefore, is the Creator about, <span
id="fr_4723"></span>[4724](#fn_4723) that He should detain outside for
punishment those whom His adversary shut out, when He ought rather to
have kindly received them, if they must come into His hands, <span
id="fr_4724"></span>[4725](#fn_4724) for the greater irritation of His
rival?  But when about to exclude the wicked, he must, of course, either
be aware that the Creator would detain them for punishment, or not be
aware. Consequently either the wicked will be detained *by the Creator*
against the will of the excluder, in which case he will be inferior to
the Creator, submitting to Him unwillingly; or else, if the process is
carried out with his will, then he himself has judicially determined its
execution; and then he who is the very originator of the Creator’s
infamy, will not prove to be one whit better than the Creator. Now, if
these ideas be incompatible with reason—of one being supposed to punish,
and the other to liberate—then to one only power will appertain both the
judgment and the kingdom and while they both belong to one, He who
executeth judgment can be none else than *the Christ* of the Creator.
