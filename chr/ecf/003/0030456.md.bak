<span id="v.iv.vi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Doctrine of the Resurrection of
the Body, Continued. How are the Dead Raised? and with What Body Do They
Come? These Questions Answered in Such a Sense as to Maintain the Truth
of the Raised Body, Against Marcion. Christ as the Second Adam Connected
with the Creator of the First Man. Let Us Bear the Image of the
Heavenly. The Triumph Over Death in Accordance with the Prophets.  Hosea
and St. Paul Compared.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.x-p2"></span>Let us now return to the resurrection, to
the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed
sufficient attention in another work of ours. <span
id="fr_5625"></span>[5626](#fn_5625.md) But we will not be wanting (in some
defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as
are ignorant of that little treatise. “What,” asks he, “shall they do
who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not?” <span
id="fr_5626"></span>[5627](#fn_5626.md) Now, never mind <span
id="fr_5627"></span>[5628](#fn_5627.md) that practice, (whatever it may
have been.)  The *Februarian* lustrations <span
id="fr_5628"></span>[5629](#fn_5628.md) will perhaps <span
id="fr_5629"></span>[5630](#fn_5629) answer him (quite as well.md), by
praying for the dead. <span id="fr_5630"></span>[5631](#fn_5630.md) Do not
then suppose that the apostle here indicates some new *god as the*
author and advocate of this (baptism for the dead.  His only aim in
alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the
resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized
for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of *such* a
resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining “but one
baptism.” <span id="fr_5631"></span>[5632](#fn_5631.md) To be “baptized for
the dead” therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body; <span
id="fr_5632"></span>[5633](#fn_5632.md) for, as we have shown, it is the
<span id="page_450">p. 450</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.x-Page_450"></span>*body* which becomes *dead*.  What, then,
shall they do who are baptized for the body, <span
id="fr_5633"></span>[5634](#fn_5633.md) if the body <span
id="fr_5634"></span>[5635](#fn_5634.md) rises not again? We stand, then, on
firm ground (when we say) that <span
id="fr_5635"></span>[5636](#fn_5635.md) the next question which the apostle
has discussed equally relates to the body. But “some man will say, ‘How
are the dead raised up? With what body do they come?’” <span
id="fr_5636"></span>[5637](#fn_5636.md) Having established the doctrine of
the resurrection which was denied, it was natural <span
id="fr_5637"></span>[5638](#fn_5637.md) to discuss what would be the sort
of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this
point we have other opponents with whom to engage. For Marcion does not
in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the
salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which
he raises is not concerning *the sort* of body, but the very *substance*
thereof. Notwithstanding, <span id="fr_5638"></span>[5639](#fn_5638.md) he
is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting
the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, “How are the dead
raised up? with what body do they come?” For as he treated of the sort
of *body*, he of course *ipso facto* proclaimed in the argument that it
was a *body* which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his
examples “wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body,
such as it hath pleased Him;” <span id="fr_5639"></span>[5640](#fn_5639.md)
since also he says, that “to every seed is its own body;” <span
id="fr_5640"></span>[5641](#fn_5640.md) that, consequently, <span
id="fr_5641"></span>[5642](#fn_5641.md) “there is one kind of flesh of men,
whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there
are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one
glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of
the stars” <span id="fr_5642"></span>[5643](#fn_5642.md) —does he not
therefore intimate that there is to be <span
id="fr_5643"></span>[5644](#fn_5643.md) a resurrection of the flesh or
body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not
also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God
from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for)
examples? “So also,” says he, “is the resurrection of the dead.” <span
id="fr_5644"></span>[5645](#fn_5644.md) How?  Just as the grain, which is
sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the
dissolving thereof in the ground, “because it is sown in corruption,”
(but “is raised) to honour and power.” <span
id="fr_5645"></span>[5646](#fn_5645.md) Now, just as in the case of the
grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body,
who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you
remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the
dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise,
“although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual
body.” <span id="fr_5646"></span>[5647](#fn_5646.md) Now, although the
natural principle of life <span id="fr_5647"></span>[5648](#fn_5647.md) and
the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the “natural body”
may fairly be taken <span id="fr_5648"></span>[5649](#fn_5648.md) to
signify the soul, <span id="fr_5649"></span>[5650](#fn_5649.md) and “the
spiritual body” the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing <span
id="fr_5650"></span>[5651](#fn_5650.md) the apostle to say that the soul is
to become spirit in the resurrection, but that *the body* (which, as
being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of
the soul, <span id="fr_5651"></span>[5652](#fn_5651.md) admits of being
called animal (or *natural* <span id="fr_5652"></span>[5653](#fn_5652) .md)
*will become spiritual*, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal
life.  In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is “sown
in corruption,” when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that
(after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the
flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future
change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as
he says further down, “That was not first which is spiritual.” <span
id="fr_5653"></span>[5654](#fn_5653.md) For to this effect he just before
remarked of Christ Himself: “The first man Adam was made a living soul,
the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.” <span
id="fr_5654"></span>[5655](#fn_5654.md) Our heretic, however, in the excess
of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this
shape, altered “last Adam” into “last Lord;” <span
id="fr_5655"></span>[5656](#fn_5655.md) because he feared, of course, that
if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should
contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that
God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent.
For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second
Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally
alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or
origin. <span id="fr_5656"></span>[5657](#fn_5656.md) Now, although among
things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and
another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be
a different <span id="page_451">p. 451</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.x-Page_451"></span>one, he himself indeed may be called the
last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can
be the last, which is like this first in nature. <span
id="fr_5657"></span>[5658](#fn_5657.md) It is, however, not like the first
in nature, when it is not the work of the same author.  In like manner
(the heretic) will be refuted also with the word “*man:* ”  “The first
man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from
heaven.” <span id="fr_5658"></span>[5659](#fn_5658.md) Now, since the first
was a *man*, how can there be a second, unless he is a *man* also? Or,
else, if the second is “Lord,” was the first “Lord” also? <span
id="fr_5659"></span>[5660](#fn_5659.md) It is, however, quite enough for
me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and
Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the
“Adam” *and* the “man” (of the apostle).  What follows will also be too
much for him. For when the apostle says, “As is the earthy,” that is,
*man*, “such also are they that are earthy”—men again, of course;
“therefore as is the heavenly,” meaning the Man, from heaven, “such are
the men also that are heavenly.” <span
id="fr_5660"></span>[5661](#fn_5660.md) For he could not possibly have
opposed to earthly *men* any heavenly beings that were not *men* also;
his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and
expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect
of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly
and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they
are reckoned (as to their ultimate condition <span
id="fr_5661"></span>[5662](#fn_5661) .md) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore,
when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: “As we have
borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the
heavenly,” <span id="fr_5662"></span>[5663](#fn_5662.md) —language which
relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of
the present time. He says, *Let us bear*, as a precept; not *We shall
bear*, in the sense of a promise—wishing us to walk even as he himself
was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the
old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? “Now
this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
God.” <span id="fr_5663"></span>[5664](#fn_5663.md) He means the works of
the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men
of the kingdom of God. <span id="fr_5664"></span>[5665](#fn_5664.md) In
other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition
instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that “they
who are in the flesh cannot please God.” <span
id="fr_5665"></span>[5666](#fn_5665.md) Now, when shall we be able to
please God except whilst we are in this flesh?  There is, I imagine, no
other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even
naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh,
then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent
from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the
sin thereof. Now, since in the word *flesh* we are enjoined to put off,
not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of
the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh,
not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is
done, but only the evil which is done in it.  To administer poison is a
crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is
the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it
mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which
is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to <span
id="fr_5666"></span>[5667](#fn_5666.md) the kingdom of God, after the deeds
done in the body have been atoned for, whilst the body, which was
nothing but (the soul’s) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation?
Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape?  Not that we
indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a
resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom
through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the
kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the
kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when
changed it obtains the kingdom. “For the dead shall be raised
incorruptible,” even those who had been corruptible when their bodies
fell into decay; “and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling
of an eye. <span id="fr_5667"></span>[5668](#fn_5667.md) For this
corruptible”—and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own
flesh—“must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
immortality,” <span id="fr_5668"></span>[5669](#fn_5668.md) in order,
indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God.
“For we shall be like the angels.” <span
id="fr_5669"></span>[5670](#fn_5669.md) This will be the <span
id="page_452">p. 452</span> <span id="v.iv.vi.x-Page_452"></span>perfect
change of our flesh—only after its resurrection. <span
id="fr_5670"></span>[5671](#fn_5670.md) Now if, on the contrary, <span
id="fr_5671"></span>[5672](#fn_5671.md) there is to be no flesh, how then
shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become
something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no
longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have
given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, “Flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of God;” <span id="fr_5672"></span>[5673](#fn_5672.md)
for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition <span
id="fr_5673"></span>[5674](#fn_5673.md) which ensues on the resurrection.
Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written
by the Creator, “O death, where is thy victory”—or thy struggle? <span
id="fr_5674"></span>[5675](#fn_5674.md) “O death, where is thy
sting?” <span id="fr_5675"></span>[5676](#fn_5675.md) —written, I say, by
the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet <span
id="fr_5676"></span>[5677](#fn_5676.md) —to Him will belong the gift, that
is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in
the kingdom.  And to none other God does he tell us that “thanks” are
due, for having enabled us to achieve “the victory” even over death,
than to Him from whom he received the very expression <span
id="fr_5677"></span>[5678](#fn_5677.md) of the exulting and triumphant
challenge to the mortal foe.

<span id="v.iv.vi.x-p6"></span> Kalendæ Februariæ. The great expiation
or lustration, celebrated at Rome in the month which received its name
from the festival, is described by Ovid, *Fasti*, book ii., lines 19–28,
and 267–452, in which latter passage the same feast is called
*Lupercalia*. Of course as the rites were held on the 15th of the month,
the word *kalendæ* here has not its more usual meaning (Paley’s edition
of the *Fasti*, pp. 52–76). Oehler refers also to Macrobius, *Saturn.*
i. 13; Cicero, *De Legibus*, ii. 21; Plutarch, *Numa*, p. 132. He well
remarks (note *in loc.*), that Tertullian, by intimating that the
heathen rites of the *Februa* will afford quite as satisfactory an
answer to the apostle’s question, as the Christian superstition alluded
to, not only means no authorization of the said superstition for
himself, but expresses his belief that St. Paul’s only object was to
gather some evidence for the great doctrine of the resurrection from the
faith which underlay the practice alluded to. In this respect, however,
the heathen festival would afford a much less pointed illustration; for
though it was indeed a lustration for the dead, <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.vi.x-p6.1"></span>περὶ νεκρῶν</span>, and
had for its object their happiness and welfare, it went no further than
a vague notion of an indefinite immortality, and it touched not the
recovery of the body. There is therefore force in Tertullian’s *si
forte*.

<span id="v.iv.vi.x-p30"></span> Animale. The terseness of his argument,
by his use of the same radical terms *Anima* and *Animale*, is lost in
the English. \[See Cap. 15 *infra*. Also, Kaye p. 180. St. Augustine
seems to tolerate our author’s views of a corporal spirit in his
treatise *de Hæresibus*.\]

T. argues from the reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.vi.x-p40.2"></span>φορέσωμεν</span> (instead of <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.vi.x-p40.3"></span>φορέσομεν</span>), which
indeed was read by many of the fathers, and (what is still more
important) is found in the *Codex Sinaiticus*. We add the critical note
of Dean Alford on this reading: “ACDFKL rel latt copt goth, Theodotus,
Basil, Cæsarius, Cyril, Macarius, Methodius (who prefixes <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.vi.x-p40.4"></span>ἕνα</span>), Chrysostom,
Epiphanius, Ps. Athanasius, Damascene, Irenæus (int), Tertullian,
Cyprian, Hilary, Jerome.”  Alford retains the usual <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.vi.x-p40.5"></span>φορέσομεν</span>, on the
strength chiefly of the *Codex Vaticanus*.
