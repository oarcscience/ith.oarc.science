<span id="v.vii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Christ’s Flesh in Nature, the
Same as Ours, Only Sinless. The Difference Between Carnem Peccati and
Peccatum Carnis: It is the Latter Which Christ Abolished. The Flesh of
the First Adam, No Less Than that of the Second Adam, Not Received from
Human Seed, Although as Entirely Human as Our Own, Which is Derived from
It.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xvi-p2"></span>The famous Alexander, <span
id="fr_7166"></span>[7167](#fn_7166.md) too, instigated by his love of
disputation in the true fashion of heretical temper, has made himself
conspicuous against us; he will have us say that Christ put on flesh of
an earthly origin, <span id="fr_7167"></span>[7168](#fn_7167.md) in order
that He might in His own person abolish sinful flesh. <span
id="fr_7168"></span>[7169](#fn_7168.md) Now, even if we did assert this as
our opinion, we should be able to defend it in such a way as completely
to avoid the extravagant folly which he ascribes to us in making us
suppose that the very flesh of Christ was in Himself abolished as being
sinful; because we mention our belief (in public), <span
id="fr_7169"></span>[7170](#fn_7169.md) that it is sitting at the right
hand of the Father in heaven; and we further declare that it will come
again from thence in all the pomp <span
id="fr_7170"></span>[7171](#fn_7170.md) of the Father’s glory: it is
therefore just as impossible for us to say that it is abolished, as it
is for us to maintain that it is sinful, and so made void, since in it
there has been no fault. We maintain, moreover, that what has been
abolished in Christ is not *carnem peccati*, “sinful flesh,” but
*peccatum carnis*, “sin in the flesh,”—not the material thing, but its
condition; <span id="fr_7171"></span>[7172](#fn_7171.md) not the substance,
but its flaw; <span id="fr_7172"></span>[7173](#fn_7172.md) and (this we
aver) on the authority of the apostle, who says, “He abolished sin in
the flesh.” <span id="fr_7173"></span>[7174](#fn_7173.md) Now in another
sentence he says that Christ was “in the likeness of sinful
flesh,” <span id="fr_7174"></span>[7175](#fn_7174.md) not, however, as if
He had taken on Him “the likeness of the flesh,” in the sense of a
semblance of body instead of its reality; but he means us to understand
likeness to the flesh which sinned, <span
id="fr_7175"></span>[7176](#fn_7175.md) because the flesh of Christ, which
committed no sin itself, resembled that which had sinned,—resembled it
in its nature, but not in the corruption it received from Adam; whence
we also affirm that there was in Christ the same flesh as that whose
nature in man is sinful.  In the flesh, therefore, *we say* that sin has
been abolished, because in Christ that same flesh is maintained without
sin, which in man was not maintained without sin. Now, it would not
contribute to the purpose of Christ’s abolishing sin in the flesh, if He
did not abolish it in that flesh in which was the nature of sin, nor
(would it conduce) to His glory. For <span id="page_536">p. 536</span>
<span id="v.vii.xvi-Page_536"></span>surely it would have been no
strange thing if He had removed the stain of sin in some better flesh,
and one which should possess a different, even a sinless, nature! Then,
you say, if He took our flesh, Christ’s was a sinful one. Do not,
however, fetter with mystery a sense which is quite intelligible. For in
putting on our flesh, He made it His own; in making it His own, He made
it sinless.  A word of caution, however, must be addressed to all who
refuse to believe that our flesh was in Christ on the ground that it
came not of the seed of a human father, <span
id="fr_7176"></span>[7177](#fn_7176.md) let them remember that Adam himself
received this flesh of ours without the seed of a human father. As earth
was converted into this flesh of ours without the seed of a human
father, so also was it quite possible for the Son of God to take to
Himself <span id="fr_7177"></span>[7178](#fn_7177.md) the substance of the
selfsame flesh, without a human father’s agency. <span
id="fr_7178"></span>[7179](#fn_7178.md)

<span id="v.vii.xvi-p3"></span> Although Tertullian dignifies him with
an *ille*, we have no particulars of this man. \[It may be that this is
an *epithet*, rather than a name, given to some enemy of truth like
Alexander the “Coppersmith” ([2 Tim. iv.
14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014)<span id="v.vii.xvi-p3.1"></span>.md)
or like that ([1 Tim. i. 20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md)<span

(‘He condemned sin in the flesh’). Had Tertullian a different reading in

Jerome translates the Greek <span class="Greek"><span

*Adv. Marcionem*, ver. 14. Dr. Neander has pointed out two passages in
which Tertullian has ‘damnavit or *damnaverit* delinquentiam in carne.’
