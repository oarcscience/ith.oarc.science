<span id="vi.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.</span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p2"></span>Other things, hindrances equally of the
soul, may have accompanied you as far as the prison gate, to which also
your relatives may have attended you. There and thenceforth you were
severed from the world; how much more from the ordinary course of
worldly life and all its affairs! Nor let this separation from the world
alarm you; for if we reflect that the world is more really the prison,
we shall see that you have gone out of a prison rather than into one.
The world has the greater darkness, blinding men’s hearts. The world
imposes the more grievous fetters, binding men’s very souls.  The world
breathes out the worst impurities—human lusts. The world contains the
larger number of criminals, even the whole human race.  Then, last of
all, it awaits the judgment, not of the proconsul, but of God.
Wherefore, O blessed, you may regard yourselves as having been
translated from a prison to, we may say, a place of safety. It is full
of darkness, but ye yourselves are light; it has bonds, but God has made
you free. Unpleasant exhalations are there, but ye are an odour of
sweetness. The <span id="page_694">p. 694</span> <span
id="vi.v.ii-Page_694"></span>judge is daily looked for, but ye shall
judge the judges themselves.  Sadness may be there for him who sighs for
the world’s enjoyments. The Christian outside the prison has renounced
the world, but in the prison he has renounced a prison too. It is of no
consequence where you are in the world—you who are not of it. And if you
have lost some of life’s sweets, it is the way of business to suffer
present loss, that after gains may be the larger.  Thus far I say
nothing of the rewards to which God invites the martyrs. Meanwhile let
us compare the life of the world and of the prison, and see if the
spirit does not gain more in the prison than the flesh loses. Nay, by
the care of the Church and the love of the brethren, <span
id="fr_8963"></span>[8964](#fn_8963.md) even the flesh does not lose there
what is for its good, while the spirit obtains besides important
advantages.  You have no occasion to look on strange gods, you do not
run against their images; you have no part in heathen holidays, even by
mere bodily mingling in them; you are not annoyed by the foul fumes of
idolatrous solemnities; you are not pained by the noise of the public
shows, nor by the atrocity or madness or immodesty of their celebrants;
your eyes do not fall on stews and brothels; you are free from causes of
offence, from temptations, from unholy reminiscences; you are free now
from persecution too. The prison does the same service for the Christian
which the desert did for the prophet.  Our Lord Himself spent much of
His time in seclusion, that He might have greater liberty to pray, that
He might be quit of the world. It was in a mountain solitude, too, He
showed His glory to the disciples. Let us drop the name of prison; let
us call it a place of retirement. Though the body is shut in, though the
flesh is confined, all things are open to the spirit.  In spirit, then,
roam abroad; in spirit walk about, not setting before you shady paths or
long colonnades, but the way which leads to God. As often as in spirit
your footsteps are there, so often you will not be in bonds.  The leg
does not feel the chain when the mind is in the heavens. The mind
compasses the whole man about, and whither it wills it carries him. But
where thy heart shall be, there shall be thy treasure. <span
id="fr_8964"></span>[8965](#fn_8964.md) Be there our heart, then, where we
would have our treasure.
