<span id="vi.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Water Chosen as a Vehicle of
Divine Operation and Wherefore. Its Prominence First of All in
Creation.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p2"></span>Mindful of this declaration as of a
conclusive prescript, we nevertheless *proceed to* treat *the question*,
“How *foolish* and *impossible* it is to be formed anew by water. In
what respect, pray, has this material substance merited an office of so
high dignity?” The authority, I suppose, of the liquid element has to be
examined. <span id="fr_8550"></span>[8551](#fn_8550) This <span
id="fr_8551"></span>[8552](#fn_8551) however, is found in abundance, and
that from the very beginning. For *water* is one of those things which,
before all the furnishing of the world, were quiescent with God in a yet
unshapen <span id="fr_8552"></span>[8553](#fn_8552) state. “In the first
beginning,” saith *Scripture*, “God made the heaven and the earth. But
the earth was invisible, and unorganized, <span
id="fr_8553"></span>[8554](#fn_8553) and darkness was over the abyss;
and the Spirit of the Lord was hovering <span
id="fr_8554"></span>[8555](#fn_8554) over the waters.” <span
id="fr_8555"></span>[8556](#fn_8555) The first thing, O man, which you
have to venerate, is the *age* of the waters in that their substance is
ancient; the second, their *dignity*, in that they were the seat of the
Divine Spirit, more pleasing *to Him*, no doubt, than all the other then
existing elements. For the darkness was total thus far, shapeless,
without the ornament of stars; and the abyss gloomy; and the earth
unfurnished; and the heaven unwrought: water <span
id="fr_8556"></span>[8557](#fn_8556) alone—always a perfect, gladsome,
simple material substance, pure in itself—supplied a worthy vehicle to
God.  What *of the fact* that waters were in some way the regulating
powers by which the disposition of the world thenceforward was
constituted by God?  For the suspension of the celestial firmament in
the midst He caused by “dividing the waters;” <span
id="fr_8557"></span>[8558](#fn_8557) the suspension of “the dry land” He
accomplished by “separating the waters.” After the world had been
hereupon set in order through *its* elements, when inhabitants were
given it, “the waters” were the first to receive the precept “to bring
forth living creatures.” <span id="fr_8558"></span>[8559](#fn_8558)
Water was the first to produce that which had life, that it might be no
wonder in baptism if waters know how to give life. <span
id="fr_8559"></span>[8560](#fn_8559) For was not the work of fashioning
man himself also achieved with the aid of waters?  Suitable material is
found in the *earth*, yet not apt for the purpose unless it be moist and
juicy; which (earth) “the waters,” separated the fourth day before into
their own place, temper with their remaining moisture to a clayey
consistency. If, from that time onward, I go forward in recounting
universally, or at more length, the evidences of the “authority” of this
element which I can adduce to show how great is its power or its grace;
how many ingenious devices, how many functions, how useful an
instrumentality, it affords the world, I fear I may seem to have
collected rather the praises of water than the reasons of baptism;
although I should *thereby* teach all the more fully, that it is not to
be doubted that God has made the material substance which He has
disposed throughout all His products <span
id="fr_8560"></span>[8561](#fn_8560) and works, obey Him also in His own
peculiar sacraments; that the *material substance* which governs
terrestrial life acts as agent likewise in the celestial.
