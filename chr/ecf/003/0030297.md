<span id="v.iii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Truth First, Falsehood
Afterwards, as Its Perversion. Christ’s Parable Puts the Sowing of the
Good Seed Before the Useless Tares.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxxi-p2"></span>Let me return, however, from this
digression <span id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176) to discuss <span
id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177) the priority of truth, and the
comparative lateness <span id="fr_2178"></span>[2179](#fn_2178) of
falsehood, deriving support for my argument even from that parable which
puts in the first place the sowing by the Lord of the good seed of the
wheat, but introduces at a later stage the adulteration of the crop by
its enemy the devil with the useless weed of the wild oats.  For herein
is figuratively described the difference of doctrines, since in other
passages also the word of God is likened unto seed. From the actual
order, therefore, it becomes clear, that that which was first delivered
is of the Lord and is true, whilst that is strange and false which was
afterwards introduced. This sentence will keep its ground in opposition
to all later heresies, which have no consistent quality of kindred
knowledge <span id="fr_2179"></span>[2180](#fn_2179) inherent in them—to
claim the truth as on their side.
