<span id="vi.vi.ix-p3"></span>(Dinocrates, cap. ii. p. 701.)

<span id="vi.vi.ix-p4"></span>The avidity with which the Latin
controversial writers seize upon this fanciful passage, (which, in fact,
is subversive of their whole doctrine about Purgatory, as is the text
from the *Maccabees*) makes emphatic the utter absence from the early
Fathers of any reference to such a dogma; which, had it existed, must
have appeared in every reference to the State of the Dead, and in every
account of the discipline of penitents.  Arbp. Usher <span
id="fr_9010"></span>[9011](#fn_9010.md) ingeniously turns the tables upon
these errorists, by quoting the Prayers for the Dead, which were used in
the Early Church, but which, such as they were, not only make no mention
of a Purgatory, but refute the dogma, by their uniform limitation of
such prayers to the blessed dead, and to their consummation of bliss at
the Last day and not before.  Such a prayer *seems* to occur in [2 Tim.
i. 18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#018.md)<span id="vi.vi.ix-p5.1"></span>.
The context ([2 Tim. 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016.md), [2 Tim.
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019)<span id="vi.vi.ix-p5.2"></span>.md)
strongly supports this view; Onesiphorus is spoken of as if deceased,
apparently. But, as Chrysostom understands it, he was only absent (in
Rome) from his household.  From [2 Tim.
1.17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#017.md)<span id="vi.vi.ix-p5.3"></span>
we should infer that he had left Rome. <span
