<span id="iv.xi.lv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LV.—The Christian Idea of the Position
of Hades; The Blessedness of Paradise Immediately After Death. The
Privilege of the Martyrs.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.lv-p2"></span>By ourselves the lower regions (of Hades)
are not supposed to be a bare cavity, nor some subterranean sewer of the
world, but a vast deep space in the interior of the earth, and a
concealed recess in its very bowels; inasmuch as we read that Christ in
His death spent three days in the heart of the earth, <span
id="fr_1798"></span>[1799](#fn_1798.md) that is, in the secret inner recess
which is hidden in the earth, and enclosed by the earth, and
superimposed on the abysmal depths which lie still lower down. Now
although Christ is God, yet, being also man, “He died according to the
Scriptures,” <span id="fr_1799"></span>[1800](#fn_1799.md) and “according
to the same Scriptures was buried.” <span
id="fr_1800"></span>[1801](#fn_1800.md) With the same law of His being He
fully complied, by remaining in Hades in the form and condition of a
dead man; nor did He ascend into the heights of heaven before descending
into the lower parts of the earth, that He might there make the
patriarchs and prophets partakers of Himself. <span
id="fr_1801"></span>[1802](#fn_1801) (This being the case.md), you must
suppose Hades to be a subterranean region, and keep at arm’s length
those who are too proud to believe that the souls of the faithful
deserve a place in the lower regions. <span
id="fr_1802"></span>[1803](#fn_1802.md) These persons, who are “servants
above their Lord, and disciples above their Master,” <span
id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803.md) would no doubt spurn to receive the
comfort of the resurrection, if they must expect it in Abraham’s bosom.
But it was for this purpose, say they, that Christ descended into hell,
that we might not ourselves have to descend thither. Well, then, what
difference is there between heathens and Christians, if the same prison
awaits them all when dead? How, indeed, shall the soul mount up to
heaven, where Christ is already sitting at the Father’s right hand, when
as yet the archangel’s trumpet has not been heard by the command of
God, <span id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804.md) —when as yet those whom
the coming of the Lord is to find on the earth, have not been caught up
into the air to meet Him at His coming, <span
id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805.md) in company with the dead in Christ,
who shall be the first to arise? <span
id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806.md) To no one is heaven opened; the
earth is still safe for him, I would not say it is shut against him.
When the world, indeed, shall pass away, then the kingdom of heaven
shall be opened.  Shall we then have to sleep high up in ether, with the
boy-loving worthies of Plato; or in the air with Arius; or around the
moon with the Endymions of the Stoics? No, but in Paradise, you tell me,
whither already the patriarchs and prophets have removed from Hades in
the retinue of the Lord’s resurrection. How is it, then, that the region
of Paradise, which as revealed to John in the Spirit lay under the
altar, <span id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807.md) displays no other
souls as in it besides the souls of the martyrs? How is it that the most
heroic martyr Perpetua on the day of her passion saw only her
fellow-martyrs there, in the revelation which she received of Paradise,
if it were not that the sword which guarded the entrance permitted none
to go in thereat, except those who had died in Christ and not in Adam? A
new death for God, even the extraordinary one for Christ, is admitted
into the reception-room of mortality, specially altered and adapted to
receive the new-comer. Observe, then, the difference between a heathen
and a Christian in their death: if you have to lay down your life for
God, as the Comforter <span id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808.md)
counsels, it is not in gentle fevers and on soft beds, but in the sharp
pains of martyrdom: you must take up the cross and bear it after your
Master, as He has Himself instructed you. <span
id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809.md) The sole key to unlock Paradise is
your own life’s blood. <span id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810.md) You
have a treatise by us, <span id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811.md) (on
Paradise), in which we have established the position that every soul is
detained in safe keeping in Hades until the day of the Lord.
