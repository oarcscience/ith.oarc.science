<span id="v.iii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—The Apostles Did in All Cases
Teach the Whole Truth to the Whole Church. No Reservation, Nor Partial
Communication to Favourite Friends.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxvi-p2"></span>Besides which, it must have followed,
that, for the man to whom he committed the ministration of the gospel,
he would add the injunction that it be not ministered in all
places, <span id="fr_2125"></span>[2126](#fn_2125) and without respect
to persons, <span id="fr_2126"></span>[2127](#fn_2126) in accordance
with the Lord’s saying, “Not to cast one’s pearls before swine, nor that
which is holy unto dogs.” <span id="fr_2127"></span>[2128](#fn_2127)
Openly did the Lord speak, <span id="fr_2128"></span>[2129](#fn_2128)
without any intimation of a hidden mystery.  He had Himself commanded
that, “whatsoever they had heard in darkness” and in secret, they should
“declare in the light and on the house-tops.” <span
id="fr_2129"></span>[2130](#fn_2129) He had Himself foreshown, by means
of a parable, that they should not keep back in secret, fruitless of
interest, <span id="fr_2130"></span>[2131](#fn_2130) a single pound,
that is, one word of His.  He used Himself to tell them that a candle
was not usually “pushed away under a bushel, but placed on a
candlestick,” in order to “give light to all who are in the
house.” <span id="fr_2131"></span>[2132](#fn_2131) These things the
apostles either neglected, or failed to understand, if they fulfilled
them not, by concealing any portion of the light, that is, of the word
of God and the mystery of Christ. Of no man, I am quite sure, were they
afraid,—neither of Jews nor of Gentiles in their violence; <span
id="fr_2132"></span>[2133](#fn_2132) with all the greater freedom, then,
would they certainly preach in the church, who held not their tongue in
synagogues and public places. Indeed they would have found it impossible
either to convert Jews or to bring in Gentiles, unless they “set forth
in order” <span id="fr_2133"></span>[2134](#fn_2133) that which they
would have them believe.  Much less, when churches were advanced in the
faith, would they have withdrawn from them anything for the purpose of
committing it separately to some few others. Although, even supposing
that among intimate friends, <span id="fr_2134"></span>[2135](#fn_2134)
so to speak, they did hold certain discussions, yet it is incredible
that these could have been such as to bring in some other rule of faith,
differing from and contrary to that which they were proclaiming through
the Catholic churches, <span id="fr_2135"></span>[2136](#fn_2135) —as if
they spoke of one God in the Church, (and) another at home, and
described one substance of Christ, publicly, (and) another secretly, and
announced one hope of the resurrection before all men, (and) another
before the few; although they themselves, in their epistles, besought
men that they would all speak one and the same thing, and that there
should be no divisions and dissensions in the church, <span
id="fr_2136"></span>[2137](#fn_2136) seeing that <span id="page_256">p.
256</span> <span id="v.iii.xxvi-Page_256"></span>they, whether Paul or
others, preached the same things. Moreover, they remembered (the words):
“Let your communication be yea, yea; nay, nay; for whatsoever is more
than this cometh of evil;” <span id="fr_2137"></span>[2138](#fn_2137) so
that they were not to handle the gospel in a diversity of treatment.
