<span id="v.iv.vi.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—The Epistle to Philemon.  This
Epistle Not Mutilated.  Marcion’s Inconsistency in Accepting This, and
Rejecting Three Other Epistles Addressed to Individuals.  Conclusions.
Tertullian Vindicates the Symmetry and Deliberate Purpose of His Work
Against Marcion.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.xxi-p2"></span>To this epistle alone did its brevity
avail to protect it against the falsifying hands of Marcion. I wonder,
however, when he received (into his *Apostolicon*) this letter which was
written but to one man, that he rejected the two epistles to Timothy and
the one to Titus, which all treat of ecclesiastical discipline. His aim,
was, I suppose, to carry out his interpolating process even to the
number of (St. <span id="page_474">p. 474</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xxi-Page_474"></span>Paul’s) epistles. And now,
reader, <span id="fr_6123"></span>[6124](#fn_6123) I beg you to remember
that we have here adduced proofs out of the apostle, in support of the
subjects which we previously <span id="fr_6124"></span>[6125](#fn_6124)
had to handle, and that we have now brought to a close <span
id="fr_6125"></span>[6126](#fn_6125) the topics which we deferred to
this (portion of our) work. (This favour I request of you,) that you may
not think that any repetition *here* has been superfluous, for we have
only fulfilled our former engagement to you; nor look with suspicion on
any postponement *there*, where we merely set forth the essential points
(of the argument). <span id="fr_6126"></span>[6127](#fn_6126) If you
carefully examine the entire work, you will acquit us of either having
been redundant here, or diffident there, in your own honest
judgment. <span id="fr_6127"></span>[6128](#fn_6127)
