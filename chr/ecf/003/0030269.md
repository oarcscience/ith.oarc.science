<span id="v.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Weak People Fall an Easy Prey to
Heresy, Which Derives Strength from the General Frailty of Mankind.
Eminent Men Have Fallen from Faith; Saul, David, Solomon. The Constancy
of Christ.</span>

<span id="v.iii.iii-p2"></span>It is usual, indeed, with persons of a
weaker character, to be so built up (in confidence) by certain
individuals who are caught by heresy, as to topple over into ruin
themselves. How comes it to pass, (they ask), that this woman or that
man, who were the most faithful, the most prudent, and the most
approved <span id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) in the church, have
gone over to the other side? Who that asks such a question does not in
fact reply to it himself, to the effect that men whom heresies have been
able to pervert <span id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) ought never
to have been esteemed prudent, or faithful, or approved? This again is,
I suppose, an extraordinary thing, that one who has been approved should
afterwards fall back? Saul, who was good beyond all others, is
afterwards subverted by envy. <span id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md)
David, a good man “after the Lord’s own heart,” <span
id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md) is guilty afterwards of murder and
adultery. <span id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md) Solomon, endowed by
the Lord with all grace and wisdom, is led into idolatry, by
women. <span id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) For to the Son of God
alone was it reserved to persevere to the last without sin. <span
id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md) But what if a bishop, if a deacon,
if a widow, if a virgin, if a doctor, if even a martyr, <span
id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) have fallen from the rule (of
faith), will heresies on that account appear to possess <span
id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865.md) the truth? Do we prove the
faith <span id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md) by the persons, or the
persons by the faith?  No one is wise, no one is faithful, no one excels
in dignity, <span id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867.md) but the
Christian; and no one is a Christian but he who perseveres even to the
end. <span id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868.md) You, as a man, know any
other man from the outside appearance. You think as you see. And you see
as far only as you have eyes. But says (the Scripture), “the eyes of the
Lord are lofty.” <span id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869.md) “Man looketh
at the outward appearance, but God looketh at the heart.” <span
id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870) “The Lord (beholdeth and.md) knoweth
them that are His;” <span id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md) and “the
plant which (my heavenly Father) hath not planted, He rooteth up;” <span
id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md) and “the first shall,” as He shows,
“be last;” <span id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873.md) and He carries
“His fan in His hand to purge His threshing-floor.” <span
id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md) Let the chaff of a fickle faith fly
off as much as it will at every blast of temptation, all the purer will
be that heap of corn which shall be laid up in the garner of the Lord.
Did not certain of the disciples turn back from the Lord Himself, <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md) when they were offended? Yet the
rest did not therefore think that they must turn away from following
Him, <span id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md) but because they knew
that He was the Word of Life, and was come from God, <span
id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877.md) they continued in His company to
the very last, after He had gently inquired of them whether they also
would go away. <span id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878.md) It is a
comparatively small thing, <span id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879.md)
that certain men, like Phygellus, and Hermogenes, and Philetus, and
Hymenæus, deserted His apostle: <span
id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880.md) the betrayer of Christ was himself
one of the apostles. We are surprised at seeing His churches forsaken by
some men, although the things which we suffer after the example of
Christ Himself, show us to be Christians. “They went out from us,” says
(St. John,) “but they were not of us. If they had been of us, they would
no doubt have continued with us.” <span
id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881.md)
