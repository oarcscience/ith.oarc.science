<span id="v.vi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Many Eminent Christian Writers Have
Carefully and Fully Refuted the Heresy.  These the Author Makes His Own
Guides.</span>

<span id="v.vi.v-p2"></span>My own path, however, lies along the
original tenets <span id="fr_6664"></span>[6665](#fn_6664.md) of their
chief teachers, not with the self-appointed leaders of their
promiscuous <span id="fr_6665"></span>[6666](#fn_6665.md) followers. Nor
shall we hear it said of us from any quarter, that we have of our own
mind fashioned our own materials, since these have been already
produced, both in respect of the opinions and their refutations, in
carefully written volumes, by so many eminently <span id="page_506">p.
506</span> <span id="v.vi.v-Page_506"></span>holy and excellent men, not
only those who have lived before us, but those also who were
contemporary with the heresiarchs themselves: for instance Justin,
philosopher and martyr; <span id="fr_6666"></span>[6667](#fn_6666.md)
Miltiades, the sophist <span id="fr_6667"></span>[6668](#fn_6667.md) of the
churches; Irenæus, that very exact inquirer into all doctrines; <span
id="fr_6668"></span>[6669](#fn_6668.md) our own Proculus, the model <span
id="fr_6669"></span>[6670](#fn_6669.md) of chaste old age and Christian
eloquence.  All these it would be my desire closely to follow in every
work of faith, even as in this particular one.  Now if there are no
heresies at all but what those who refute them are supposed to have
fabricated, then the apostle who predicted them <span
id="fr_6670"></span>[6671](#fn_6670.md) must have been guilty of falsehood.
If, however, there are heresies, they can be no other than those which
are the subject of discussion. No writer can be supposed to have so much
time on his hands <span id="fr_6671"></span>[6672](#fn_6671.md) as to
fabricate materials which are already in his possession.
