<span id="iv.iv.i-p5"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.i-p5.1"></span>Chapter I.—Wide Scope of the Word
Idolatry.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.i-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.i-p6.1"></span>The</span> principal crime of the human race,
the highest guilt charged upon the world, the whole procuring cause of
judgment, is idolatry. <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162) For,
although each single fault retains its own proper feature, although it
is destined to judgment under its own proper name also, yet it is marked
off under the *general* account of idolatry. Set aside names, examine
works, the idolater is likewise a murderer. Do you inquire whom he has
slain? If it contributes ought to the aggravation of the indictment, no
stranger nor personal enemy, but his own self. By what snares? Those of
his error. By what weapon? The offence done to God. By how many blows?
As many as are his idolatries. He who affirms that the idolater
*perishes not*, <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163) will affirm that
the idolater has not committed murder. Further, you may recognize in the
same crime <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164) *adultery* and
*fornication*; for he who serves false gods is doubtless an
*adulterer* <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165) of truth, because
all falsehood is adultery.  So, too, he is sunk in fornication.  For who
that is a fellow-worker with unclean spirits, does not stalk in general
pollution and fornication? And thus it is that the Holy Scriptures <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166) use the designation of fornication in
their upbraiding of idolatry. The essence of *fraud*, I take it, is,
that any should seize what is another’s, or refuse to another his due;
and, of course, fraud done toward *man* is a name of greatest crime.
Well, but idolatry does fraud to God, by refusing to Him, and conferring
on others, His honours; so that to fraud it also conjoins *contumely*.
But if fraud, just as much as fornication and adultery, entails death,
then, in these cases, equally with the former, idolatry stands
unacquitted of the impeachment of murder. After such crimes, so
pernicious, so devouring of salvation, all other crimes also, after some
manner, and separately disposed in order, find their own essence
represented in idolatry. In it also are the *concupiscences* of the
world. For what solemnity of idolatry is without the circumstance of
dress and ornament? In it are *lasciviousnesses* and *drunkennesses*;
since it is, for the most part, for the sake of food, and stomach, and
appetite, that these solemnities are frequented. In it is
*unrighteousness*. For what more unrighteous than it, which knows not
the Father of righteousness?  In it also is *vanity*, since its whole
system is vain. In it is *mendacity*, for its whole substance is false.
Thus it comes to pass, that in idolatry all crimes are detected, and in
all crimes idolatry. Even otherwise, since all faults savour of
opposition to God, and there is nothing which savours of opposition to
God which is not assigned to demons and unclean spirits, whose property
idols are; doubtless, whoever commits a fault is chargeable with
idolatry, for he does that which pertains to the proprietors of idols.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p7"></span> \[This solemn sentence vindicates the
place I have given to the *De Idololatria* in the order adopted for this
volume.  After this and the Apology come three treatises confirming its
positions, and vindicating the principles of Christians in conflict with
Idolatry, the great generic crime of a world lying in wickedness. These
three are the *De Spectaculis*, the *De Corona* and the *Ad Scapulam*.
The *De Spectaculis* was written after this treatise, in which indeed it
is mentioned (Cap. xiii.), but logically it follows, illustrates and
enforces it.  Hence my practical plan: which will be concluded by a
scheme (conjectural in part) of chronological order in which precision
is affirmed by all critics to be impossible, but, by which we may reach
approximate accuracy, with great advantage. The *De Idololatria* is free
from Montanism. But see Kaye, p. xvi.\]

<span id="iv.iv.i-p8"></span> Lit., “has not perished,” as if the
perishing were already complete; as, of course, it is *judicially* as
soon as the guilt is incurred, though not *actually*.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[61:165](0030059.htm#fr_164) <span
id="iv.iv.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.i-p9"></span> i.e., in idolatry.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[61:166](0030059.htm#fr_165) <span
id="iv.iv.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.i-p10"></span> A play on the word: we should say, “an
*adulterator*.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p11"></span> Oehler refers to [Ezek.
xxiii](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#000)<span
id="iv.iv.i-p11.1"></span>.; but many other references might be given—in
the Pentateuch and Psalms, for instance.
