<span id="v.iii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Attempt to Invalidate This
Rule of Faith Rebutted. The Apostles Safe Transmitters of the Truth.
Sufficiently Taught at First, and Faithful in the Transmission.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxii-p2"></span>But inasmuch as the proof is so near at
hand, <span id="fr_2068"></span>[2069](#fn_2068) that if it were at once
produced there would be nothing left to be dealt with, let us give way
for a while to the opposite side, if they think that they can find some
means of invalidating this rule, just as if no proof were forthcoming
from us. They usually tell us that the apostles did not know all things:
(but herein) they are impelled by the same madness, whereby they turn
round to the very opposite point, <span
id="fr_2069"></span>[2070](#fn_2069) and declare that the apostles
certainly knew all things, but did not deliver all things to all
persons,—in either case exposing Christ to blame for having sent forth
apostles who had either too much ignorance, or too little simplicity.
What man, then, of sound mind can possibly suppose that they were
ignorant of anything, whom the Lord ordained to be masters (or
teachers), <span id="fr_2070"></span>[2071](#fn_2070) keeping them, as
He did, inseparable (from Himself) in their attendance, in their
discipleship, in their society, to whom, “when they were alone, He used
to expound” all things <span id="fr_2071"></span>[2072](#fn_2071) which
were obscure, telling them that “to them it was given to know those
mysteries,” <span id="fr_2072"></span>[2073](#fn_2072) which it was not
permitted the people to understand? Was anything withheld from the
knowledge of Peter, who is called “the rock on which the church should
be built,” <span id="fr_2073"></span>[2074](#fn_2073) who also obtained
“the keys of the kingdom of heaven,” <span
id="fr_2074"></span>[2075](#fn_2074) with the power of “loosing and
binding in heaven and on earth?” <span
id="fr_2075"></span>[2076](#fn_2075) Was anything, again, concealed from
John, the Lord’s most beloved disciple, who used to lean on His
breast <span id="fr_2076"></span>[2077](#fn_2076) to whom alone the Lord
pointed Judas out as the traitor, <span
id="fr_2077"></span>[2078](#fn_2077) whom He commended to Mary as a son
in His own stead? <span id="fr_2078"></span>[2079](#fn_2078) Of what
could He have meant those to be ignorant, to whom He even exhibited His
own glory with Moses and Elias, and the Father’s voice moreover, from
heaven? <span id="fr_2079"></span>[2080](#fn_2079) Not as if He thus
disapproved <span id="fr_2080"></span>[2081](#fn_2080) of all the rest,
but because “by three witnesses must every word be established.” <span
id="fr_2081"></span>[2082](#fn_2081) After the same fashion, <span
id="fr_2082"></span>[2083](#fn_2082) too, (I suppose,) were they
ignorant to whom, after His resurrection also, He vouchsafed, as they
were journeying together, “to expound all the Scriptures.” <span
id="fr_2083"></span>[2084](#fn_2083) No doubt <span
id="fr_2084"></span>[2085](#fn_2084) He had once said, “I have yet many
things to say unto you, but ye cannot hear them now;” but even then He
added, “When He, the Spirit of truth, shall come, He will lead you into
all truth.” <span id="fr_2085"></span>[2086](#fn_2085) He (thus) shows
that there was nothing of which they were ignorant, to whom He had
promised the future attainment of all truth by help of the Spirit of
truth.  And assuredly He fulfilled His promise, since it is proved in
the Acts of the Apostles that the Holy Ghost did come down. Now they who
reject that Scripture <span id="fr_2086"></span>[2087](#fn_2086) can
neither belong to the Holy Spirit, seeing that they cannot acknowledge
that the Holy Ghost has been sent as yet to the disciples, nor can they
presume to claim to be a church themselves <span
id="fr_2087"></span>[2088](#fn_2087) who positively have no means of
proving when, and with what swaddling-clothes <span
id="fr_2088"></span>[2089](#fn_2088) this body was established. Of so
much importance is it to them not to have any proofs for the things
which they maintain, lest along with them there be introduced damaging
exposures <span id="fr_2089"></span>[2090](#fn_2089) of those things
which they mendaciously devise.
