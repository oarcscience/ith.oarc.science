<span id="v.iv.ii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Evidence for God External to
Him; But the External Creation Which Yields This Evidence is Really Not
Extraneous, for All Things are God’s. Marcion’s God, Having Nothing to
Show for Himself, No God at All.  Marcion’s Scheme Absurdly Defective,
Not Furnishing Evidence for His New God’s Existence, Which Should at
Least Be Able to Compete with the Full Evidence of the Creator.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xi-p2"></span>And justly so, they say. For who is
there that is less well known by his own (inherent) qualities than by
strange <span id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md) ones? No one. Well, I
keep to this statement. How could anything be strange <span
id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) to God, to whom, if He were
personally existent, nothing would be strange? For this is the attribute
of God, that all things are His, and all things belong to Him; or else
this question would not so readily be heard from us: What has He to do
with things strange to Him?—a point which will be more fully noticed in
its proper place. It is now sufficient to observe, that no one is proved
to exist to whom nothing is proved to belong. For as the Creator is
shown to be God, God without any doubt, from the fact that all things
are His, and nothing is strange to Him; so the rival <span
id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md) god is seen to be no god, from the
circumstance that nothing is his, and all things are therefore strange
to <span id="page_279">p. 279</span> <span
id="v.iv.ii.xi-Page_279"></span>him.  Since, then, the universe belongs
to the Creator, I see no room for any other god. All things are full of
their Author, and occupied by Him. If in created beings there be any
portion of space anywhere void of Deity, the void will be of a false
deity clearly. <span id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) By falsehood
the truth is made clear. Why cannot the vast crowd of false gods
somewhere find room for Marcion’s god?  This, therefore, I insist upon,
from the character <span id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451.md) of the
Creator, that God must have been known from the works of some world
peculiarly His own, both in its human constituents, and the rest of its
organic life; <span id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452.md) when even the
error of the world has presumed to call gods those men whom it sometimes
acknowledges, on the ground that in every such case something is seen
which provides for the uses and advantages of life. <span
id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453.md) Accordingly, this also was believed
from the character of God to be a divine function; namely, to teach or
point out what is convenient and needful in human concerns.  So
completely has the authority which has given influence to a false
divinity been borrowed from that source, whence it had previously flowed
forth to the true one. One stray vegetable <span
id="fr_2454"></span>[2455](#fn_2454.md) at least Marcion’s god ought to
have produced as his own; so might he be preached up as a new
Triptolemus. <span id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455.md) Or else state
some reason which shall be worthy of a God, why he, supposing him to
exist, created nothing; because he must, on supposition of his
existence, have been a creator, on that very principle on which it is
clear to us that our God is no otherwise existent, than as having been
the Creator of this universe of ours. For, once for all, the rule <span
id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456.md) will hold good, that they cannot
both acknowledge the Creator to be God, and also prove him divine whom
they wish to be equally believed in as God, except they adjust him to
the standard of Him whom they and all men hold to be God; which is this,
that whereas no one doubts the Creator to be God on the express ground
of His having made the universe, so, on the selfsame ground, no one
ought to believe that he also is God who has made nothing—except,
indeed, some good reason be forthcoming. And this must needs be limited
to one of two: he was either *unwilling* to create, or else *unable*.
There is no third reason. <span id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md)
Now, that he was unable, is a reason unworthy of God. Whether to have
been unwilling to be a worthy one, I want to inquire.  Tell me, Marcion,
did your god wish himself to be recognised at any time or not? With what
other purpose did he come down from heaven, and preach, and having
suffered rise again from the dead, if it were not that he might be
acknowledged? And, doubtless, since he was acknowledged, he willed it.
For no circumstance could have happened to him, if he had been
unwilling.  What indeed tended so greatly to the knowledge of himself,
as his appearing in the humiliation of the flesh,—a degradation all the
lower indeed if the flesh were only illusory? <span
id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) For it was all the more shameful if
he, who brought on himself the Creator’s curse by hanging on a tree,
only pretended the assumption of a bodily substance. A far nobler
foundation might he have laid for the knowledge of himself in some
evidences of a creation of his own, especially when he had to become
known in opposition to Him in whose territory <span
id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md) he had remained unknown by any
works from the beginning. For how happens it that the Creator, although
unaware, as the Marcionites aver, of any god being above Himself, and
who used to declare even with an oath that He existed alone, should have
guarded by such mighty works the knowledge of Himself, about which, on
the assumption of His being alone without a rival, He might have spared
Himself all care; while the Superior God, knowing all the while how well
furnished in power His inferior rival was, should have made no provision
at all towards getting Himself acknowledged? Whereas He ought to have
produced works more illustrious and exalted still, in order that He
might, after the Creator’s standard, both be acknowledged as God from
His works, and even by nobler deeds show Himself to be more potent and
more gracious than the Creator.
