<span id="iv.iii.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxx-p2"></span>For we offer prayer for the safety of
our princes to the eternal, the true, the living God, whose favour,
beyond all others, they must themselves desire.  They know from whom
they have obtained their power; they know, as they are men, from whom
they have received life itself; they are convinced that He is God alone,
on whose power alone they are entirely dependent, to whom they are
second, after whom they occupy the highest places, before and above all
the gods. Why not, since they are above all living men, and the living,
as living, are superior to the dead? They reflect upon the extent of
their power, and so they come to understand the highest; they
acknowledge that they have all their might from Him against whom their
might is nought. Let the emperor make war on heaven; let him lead heaven
captive in his triumph; let him put guards on heaven; let him impose
taxes on heaven! He cannot. Just because he is less than heaven, he is
great. For he himself is His to whom heaven and every creature
appertains. He gets his sceptre where he first got his humanity; his
power where he got the breath of life. Thither we lift our eyes, with
hands outstretched, because free from sin; with head uncovered, for we
have nothing whereof to be ashamed; finally, without a monitor, because
it is from the heart we supplicate. Without ceasing, for all our
emperors we offer prayer.  We pray for life prolonged; for security to
the empire; for protection to the imperial house; for brave armies, a
faithful senate, a virtuous people, the world at rest, whatever, as man
or Cæsar, an emperor would wish. These things I cannot ask from any but
the God from whom I know I shall obtain them, both because He alone
bestows them and because I have claims upon Him for their gift, as being
a servant of His, rendering homage to Him alone, persecuted for His
doctrine, offering to Him, at His own requirement, that costly and noble
sacrifice of prayer <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) despatched
from the chaste body, an unstained soul, a sanctified spirit, not the
few grains of incense a farthing buys <span
id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) —tears of an Arabian tree,—not a few
drops of wine,—not the blood of some worthless ox to which death is a
relief, and, in addition to other offensive things, a polluted
conscience, so that one wonders, when your victims are examined by these
vile priests, why the examination is not rather of the sacrificers than
the sacrifices. With our hands thus stretched out and up to God, rend us
with your iron claws, hang us up on crosses, wrap us in flames, take our
heads from us with the sword, let loose the wild beasts on us,—the very
attitude of a Christian praying is one of preparation for all
punishment. <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) Let this, good
rulers, be your work: wring from us the soul, beseeching God on the
emperor’s behalf. Upon the truth of God, and devotion to His name, put
the brand of crime.
