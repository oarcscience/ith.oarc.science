id="v.iv.ii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—God’s Attribute of Goodness
Considered as Natural; The God of Marcion Found Wanting Herein. It Came
Not to Man’s Rescue When First Wanted.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xxii-p2"></span>But how shall (this) Antichrist be
fully overthrown unless we relax our defence by mere prescription, <span
id="fr_2578"></span>[2579](#fn_2578) and give ourselves scope for
rebutting all his other attacks? Let us therefore next take the very
person of God Himself, or rather His shadow or phantom, <span
id="fr_2579"></span>[2580](#fn_2579) as we have it in Christ, and let
Him be examined by that condition which makes Him superior to the
Creator. And undoubtedly there will come to hand unmistakeable rules for
examining God’s goodness. My first point, however, is to discover and
apprehend the attribute, and then to draw it out into rules. Now, when I
survey the subject in its aspects of time, I nowhere descry it <span
id="fr_2580"></span>[2581](#fn_2580) from the beginning of material
existences, or at the commencement of those causes, with which it ought
to have been found, proceeding thence to do <span
id="fr_2581"></span>[2582](#fn_2581) whatever had to be done. For there
was death already, and sin the sting of death, and that malignity too of
the Creator, against which the goodness of the other god should have
been ready to bring relief; falling in with this as the primary rule of
the divine goodness (if it were to prove itself a natural *agency*), at
once coming as a succour when the cause for it began. For in God all
things should be natural and inbred, just like His own condition indeed,
in order that they may be eternal, and so not be accounted casual <span
id="fr_2582"></span>[2583](#fn_2582) and extraneous, and thereby
temporary and wanting in eternity. In God, therefore, goodness is
required to be both perpetual and unbroken, <span
id="fr_2583"></span>[2584](#fn_2583) such as, being stored up and kept
ready in the treasures of His natural properties, might precede its own
causes and material developments; and if thus preceding, might
*underlie* <span id="fr_2584"></span>[2585](#fn_2584) every first
material cause, instead of looking at it from a distance, <span
id="fr_2585"></span>[2586](#fn_2585) and standing aloof from it. <span
id="fr_2586"></span>[2587](#fn_2586) In short, here too I must inquire,
Why his <span id="fr_2587"></span>[2588](#fn_2587) goodness did not
operate from the beginning? no less pointedly than when we inquired
concerning himself, Why he was not revealed from the very first? Why,
then, did it not? since he had to be revealed by his goodness if he had
any existence. That God should at all fail in power must not be thought,
much less that He should not discharge all His natural functions; for if
these were restrained from running their course, they would cease to be
natural. Moreover, the nature of God Himself knows nothing of
inactivity.  Hence (His goodness) is reckoned as having a
beginning, <span id="fr_2588"></span>[2589](#fn_2588) if it acts. It
will thus be evident that He had no unwillingness to exercise His
goodness at any time on account of His nature. Indeed, it is impossible
that He should be unwilling because of His nature, since that so directs
itself that it would no longer exist if it ceased to act.  In Marcion’s
god, however, goodness ceased from operation at some time or other. A
goodness, therefore, which could thus at any time have ceased its action
was not natural, because with natural properties such cessation is
incompatible. And if it shall not prove to be natural, it must no longer
be believed to be eternal nor competent to Deity; because it cannot be
eternal so long as, failing to be natural, it neither provides from the
past nor guarantees for the future any means of perpetuating itself. Now
as a fact it existed not from the beginning, and, doubtless, will not
endure to the end. For it is possible for it to fail in existence some
future <span id="fr_2589"></span>[2590](#fn_2589) time or other, as it
has failed in some past <span id="fr_2590"></span>[2591](#fn_2590)
period. Forasmuch, then, as the goodness of Marcion’s god failed in the
beginning (for he did not from the first deliver man), this failure must
have been the effect of will rather than of infirmity. Now a wilful
suppression of goodness will be found to have a malignant end in view. 
For what malignity is so great as to be unwilling to do good when one
can, or to thwart <span id="fr_2591"></span>[2592](#fn_2591) what is
useful, or to permit injury? The whole description, therefore, of
Marcion’s Creator will have to be transferred <span
id="fr_2592"></span>[2593](#fn_2592) to his new god, who helped on the
ruthless <span id="fr_2593"></span>[2594](#fn_2593) proceedings of the
former by the retardation of his own goodness. For whosoever has it in
his power to prevent the happening of a thing, is accounted responsible
for it if it should occur. Man is condemned to death for tasting the
fruit of one poor tree, <span id="fr_2594"></span>[2595](#fn_2594) and
thence proceed sins with their penalties; and now all are perishing who
yet never saw a single sod of Paradise. And all this your better god
either is ignorant of, or else brooks. Is it that <span
id="fr_2595"></span>[2596](#fn_2595) he might on this account be deemed
the better, and the Creator be re<span id="page_288">p. 288</span> <span
id="v.iv.ii.xxii-Page_288"></span>garded as all that the worse? Even if
this were his purpose he would be malicious enough, for both wishing to
aggravate his rival’s obloquy by permitting His (evil) works to be done,
and by keeping the world harrassed by the wrong. What would you think of
a physician who should encourage a disease by withholding the remedy,
and prolong the danger by delaying his prescription, in order that his
cure might be more costly and more renowned? Such must be the sentence
to be pronounced against Marcion’s god: tolerant of evil, encouraging
wrong, wheedling about his grace, prevaricating in his goodness, which
he did not exhibit simply on its own account, but which he must mean to
exhibit purely, if he is good by nature and not by acquisition, <span
id="fr_2596"></span>[2597](#fn_2596) if he is supremely good in
attribute <span id="fr_2597"></span>[2598](#fn_2597) and not by
discipline, if he is God from eternity and not from Tiberius, nay (to
speak more truly), from Cerdon only and Marcion. As the case now
stands, <span id="fr_2598"></span>[2599](#fn_2598) however, such a god
as we are considering would have been more fit for Tiberius, that the
goodness of the Divine Being might be inaugurated in the world under his
imperial sway!

here proposes to forego that course.
