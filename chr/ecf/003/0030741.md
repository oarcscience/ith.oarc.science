id="vi.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Of the Times Most Suitable for
Baptism.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xix-p2"></span>The Passover affords a more *than
usually* solemn day for baptism; when, withal, the Lord’s passion, in
which we are baptized, was completed. Nor will it be incongruous to
interpret figuratively *the fact* that, when the Lord was about to
celebrate the last Passover, He said to the disciples who were sent to
make preparation, “Ye will meet a man bearing water.” <span
id="fr_8736"></span>[8737](#fn_8736.md) He points out the place for
celebrating the Passover by the sign of *water*. After that, Pentecost
is a most joyous space <span id="fr_8737"></span>[8738](#fn_8737.md) for
conferring baptisms; <span id="fr_8738"></span>[8739](#fn_8738.md) wherein,
too, the resurrection of the Lord was repeatedly proved <span
id="fr_8739"></span>[8740](#fn_8739.md) among the disciples, and the hope
of the advent of the Lord indirectly pointed to, in that, at that time,
when He had been received back into the heavens, the angels <span
id="fr_8740"></span>[8741](#fn_8740.md) told the apostles that “He would so
come, as He had withal ascended into the heavens;” <span
id="fr_8741"></span>[8742](#fn_8741.md) at Pentecost, of course. But,
moreover, when Jeremiah says, “And I will gather them together from the
extremities of the land in the feast-day,” he signifies the day of the
Passover and of Pentecost, which is properly a “feast-day.” <span
id="fr_8742"></span>[8743](#fn_8742.md) However, *every* day is the Lord’s;
every hour, every time, is apt for baptism: if there is a difference in
the *solemnity*, distinction there is none in the *grace*.
