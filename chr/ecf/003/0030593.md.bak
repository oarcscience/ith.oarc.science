<span id="v.viii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Power of God Fully Competent
to Effect the Resurrection of the Flesh.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xi-p2"></span>Thus far touching my eulogy of the flesh,
in opposition to its enemies, who are, notwithstanding, its greatest
friends also; for there is nobody who lives so much in accordance with
the flesh as they who deny the resurrection of the flesh, inasmuch as
they despise all its discipline, while they disbelieve its punishment.
It is a shrewd saying which the Paraclete utters concerning these
persons by the mouth of the prophetess Prisca: “They are carnal, <span
id="fr_7363"></span>[7364](#fn_7363.md) and yet they hate the flesh.”
Since, then, the flesh has the best guarantee that could possibly accrue
for securing to it the recompense of salvation, ought we not also to
consider well the power, and might, and competency <span
id="fr_7364"></span>[7365](#fn_7364.md) of God Himself, whether He be so
great as to be able to rebuild and restore the edifice of the flesh,
which had become dilapidated and <span id="page_553">p. 553</span> <span
id="v.viii.xi-Page_553"></span>blocked up, <span
id="fr_7365"></span>[7366](#fn_7365.md) and in every possible way
dislocated?—whether He has promulgated in the public domains of nature
any analogies to convince us of His power in this respect, lest any
should happen to be still thirsting for the knowledge of God, when faith
in Him must rest on no other basis than the belief that He is able to do
all things? You have, no doubt amongst your philosophers men who
maintain that this world is without a beginning or a maker. It is,
however, much more true, that nearly all the heresies allow it an origin
and a maker, and ascribe its creation to our God. Firmly believe,
therefore, that He produced it wholly out of nothing, and then you have
found the knowledge of God, by believing that He possesses such mighty
power. But some persons are too weak to believe all this at first, owing
to their views about Matter. They will rather have it, after the
philosophers, that the universe was in the beginning made by God out of
underlying matter. Now, even if this opinion could be held in truth,
since He must be acknowledged to have produced in His reformation of
matter far different substances and far different forms from those which
Matter itself possessed, I should maintain, with no less persistence,
that He produced these things out of nothing, since they absolutely had
no existence at all previous to His production of them. Now, where is
the difference between a thing’s being produced out of nothing or out of
something, if so be that what existed not comes into being, when even to
have had no existence is tantamount to having been nothing? The contrary
is likewise true; for having once existed amounts to having been
something. If, however, there *is* a difference, both alternatives
support my position. For if God produced all things whatever out of
nothing, He will be able to draw forth from nothing even the flesh which
had fallen into nothing; or if He moulded other things out of matter, He
will be able to call forth the flesh too from somewhere else, into
whatever *abyss* it may have been engulphed. And surely He is most
competent to re-create who created, inasmuch as it is a far greater work
to have produced than to have reproduced, to have imparted a beginning,
than to have maintained a continuance. On this principle, you may be
quite sure that the restoration of the flesh is easier than its first
formation.
