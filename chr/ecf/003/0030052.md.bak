<span id="iv.iii.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVI.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xlvi-p2"></span>We have sufficiently met, as I think,
the accusation of the various crimes on the ground of which these fierce
demands are made for Christian blood.  We have made a full exhibition of
our case; and we have shown you how we are able to prove that our
statement is correct, from the trustworthiness, I mean, and antiquity of
our sacred writings, and from the confession likewise of the powers of
spiritual wickedness themselves.  Who will venture to undertake our
refutation; not with skill of words, but, as we have managed our
demonstration, on the basis of reality? But while the truth we hold is
made clear to all, unbelief meanwhile, at the very time it is convinced
of the worth of Christianity, which has now become well known for its
benefits as well as from the intercourse of life, takes up the notion
that it is not really a thing divine, but rather a kind of philosophy. 
These are the very things, it says, the philosophers counsel and
profess—innocence, justice, patience, sobriety, chastity. Why, then, are
we not permitted an equal liberty and impunity for our doctrines as they
have, with whom, in respect of what we teach, we are compared? or why
are not they, as so like us, not pressed to the same offices, for
declining which our lives are imperilled? For who compels a philosopher
to sacrifice or take an oath, or put out useless lamps at midday? Nay,
they openly overthrow your gods, and in their writings they attack your
superstitions; and you applaud them for it. Many of them even, with your
countenance, bark out against your rulers, and are rewarded with statues
and salaries, instead of being given to the wild beasts. And very right
it should be so. For they are called philosophers, not Christians. This
name of philosopher has no power to put demons to the rout. Why are they
not able to do that too? since philosophers count demons inferior to
gods. Socrates used to say, “If the demon grant permission.” Yet <span
id="page_51">p. 51</span> <span id="iv.iii.xlvi-Page_51"></span>he, too,
though in denying the existence of your divinities he had a glimpse of
the truth, at his dying ordered a cock to be sacrificed to Æsculapius, I
believe in honour of his father, <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md)
for Apollo pronounced Socrates the wisest of men. Thoughtless Apollo!
testifying to the wisdom of the man who denied the existence of his
race. In proportion to the enmity the truth awakens, you give offence by
faithfully standing by it; but the man who corrupts and makes a mere
pretence of it precisely on this ground gains favour with its
persecutors. The truth which philosophers, these mockers and corrupters
of it, with hostile ends merely affect to hold, and in doing so deprave,
caring for nought but glory, Christians both intensely and intimately
long for and maintain in its integrity, as those who have a real concern
about their salvation. So that we are like each other neither in our
knowledge nor our ways, as you imagine.  For what certain information
did Thales, the first of natural philosophers, give in reply to the
inquiry of Crœsus regarding Deity, the delay for further thought so
often proving in vain?  There is not a Christian workman but finds out
God, and manifests Him, and hence assigns to Him all those attributes
which go to constitute a divine being, though Plato affirms that it is
far from easy to discover the Maker of the universe; and when He is
found, it is difficult to make Him known to all. But if we challenge you
to comparison in the virtue of chastity, I turn to a part of the
sentence passed by the Athenians against Socrates, who was pronounced a
corrupter of youth. The Christian confines himself to the female sex. I
have read also how the harlot Phryne kindled in Diogenes the fires of
lust, and how a certain Speusippus, of Plato’s school, perished in the
adulterous act. The Christian husband has nothing to do with any but his
own wife. Democritus, in putting out his eyes, because he could not look
on women without lusting after them, and was pained if his passion was
not satisfied, owns plainly, by the punishment he inflicts, his
incontinence.  But a Christian with grace-healed eyes is sightless in
this matter; he is mentally blind against the assaults of passion. If I
maintain our superior modesty of behaviour, there at once occurs to me
Diogenes with filth-covered feet trampling on the proud couches of
Plato, under the influence of another pride: the Christian does not even
play the proud man to the pauper. If sobriety of spirit be the virtue in
debate, why, there are Pythagoras at Thurii, and Zeno at Priene,
ambitious of the supreme power:  the Christian does not aspire to the
ædileship. If equanimity be the contention, you have Lycurgus choosing
death by self-starvation, because the Lacons had made some emendation of
his laws: the Christian, even when he is condemned, gives thanks. <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) If the comparison be made in regard to
trustworthiness, Anaxagoras denied the deposit of his enemies: the
Christian is noted for his fidelity even among those who are not of his
religion.  If the matter of sincerity is to be brought to trial,
Aristotle basely thrust his friend Hermias from his place:  the
Christian does no harm even to his foe. With equal baseness does
Aristotle play the sycophant to Alexander, instead of exercising to keep
him in the right way, and Plato allows himself to be bought by Dionysius
for his belly’s sake. Aristippus in the purple, with all his great show
of gravity, gives way to extravagance; and Hippias is put to death
laying plots against the state: no Christian ever attempted such a thing
in behalf of his brethren, even when persecution was scattering them
abroad with every atrocity.  But it will be said that some of us, too,
depart from the rules of our discipline. In that case, however, we count
them no longer Christians; but the philosophers who do such things
retain still the name and the honour of wisdom.  So, then, where is
there any likeness between the Christian and the philosopher? between
the disciple of Greece and of heaven? between the man whose object is
fame, and whose object is life? between the talker and the doer? between
the man who builds up and the man who pulls down? between the friend and
the foe of error? between one who corrupts the truth, and one who
restores and teaches it? between its chief and its custodier?
