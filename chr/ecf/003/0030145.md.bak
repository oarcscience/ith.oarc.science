id="iv.viii.i.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V. <span
id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521.md) —The Inconsistent Life of Any False
Christian No More Condemns True Disciples of Christ, Than a Passing
Cloud Obscures a Summer Sky.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.v-p3"></span>As to your saying of us that we are a
most shameful set, and utterly steeped in luxury, avarice, and
depravity, we will not deny that this is true of some. It is, however, a
sufficient testimonial for our name, that this cannot be said of all,
not even of the greater part of us. It must happen even in the
healthiest and purest body, that a mole should grow, or a wart arise on
it, or freckles disfigure it. Not even the sky itself is clear with so
perfect <span id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522.md) a serenity as not to be
flecked with some filmy cloud. <span id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523.md) A
slight spot on the face, because it is obvious in so conspicuous a part,
only serves to show purity of the entire complexion. The goodness of the
larger portion is well attested by the slender flaw.  But although you
prove that some of our people are evil, you do not hereby prove that
they are Christians.  Search and see whether there is any sect to which
(a partial shortcoming) is imputed as a general stain. <span
id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524.md) You are accustomed in conversation
yourselves to say, in disparagement of us, “Why is so-and-so deceitful,
when the Christians are so self-denying? why merciless, when they are so
merciful?” You thus bear your testimony to the fact that this is not the
character of Christians, when you ask, in the way of a retort, <span
id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md) how men who are reputed to be
Christians can be of such and such a disposition. There is a good deal
of difference between an imputation and a name, <span
id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md) between an opinion and the truth. For
names were appointed for the express purpose of setting their proper
limits between mere designation and actual condition. <span
id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) How many indeed are said to be
philosophers, who for all that do not fulfil the law of philosophy? All
bear the name in respect of their profession; but they hold the
designation without the excellence of the profession, and they disgrace
the real thing under the shallow pretence of its name. Men are not
straightway of such and such a character, because they are said to be
so; but when they are not, it is vain to say so of them: they only
deceive people who attach reality to a name, when it is its consistency
with fact which decides the condition implied in the name. <span
id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) And yet persons of this doubtful stamp
do not assemble with us, neither do they belong to our communion: by
their delinquency they become yours once more <span
id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) since we should be unwilling to mix
even with them whom your violence and cruelty compelled to recant. Yet
we should, of course, be more ready to have included amongst us those
who have unwillingly forsaken our discipline than wilful apostates.
However, you have no right to call them Christians, to whom the
Christians themselves deny that name, and who have not learned to deny
themselves.
