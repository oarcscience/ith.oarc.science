id="iv.xi.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LII.—All Kinds of Death a Violence to
Nature, Arising from Sin.—Sin an Intrusion Upon Nature as God Created
It.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.lii-p2"></span>Such, then, is the work of death—the
separation of the soul from the body.  Putting out of the question fates
and fortuitous circumstances, it has been, according to men’s views,
distinguished in a twofold form—the ordinary and the extraordinary. The
ordinary they ascribe to nature, exercising its quiet influence in the
case of each individual decease; the extraordinary is said to be
contrary to nature, happening in every violent death. As for our own
views, indeed, we know what was man’s origin, and we boldly assert and
persistently maintain that death happens not by way of natural
consequence to man, but owing to a fault and defect which is not itself
natural; although it is easy enough, no doubt, to apply the term
*natural* to faults and circumstances which seem to have been (though
from the emergence of an external cause <span
id="fr_1791"></span>[1792](#fn_1791) .md) inseparable to us from our very
birth.  If man had been directly appointed to die as the condition of
his creation, <span id="fr_1792"></span>[1793](#fn_1792.md) then of course
death must be imputed to nature.  Now, that he was not thus appointed to
die, is proved by the very law which made his condition depend on a
warning, and death result from man’s arbitrary choice. Indeed, if he had
not sinned, he certainly would not have died.  That cannot be nature
which happens by the exercise of volition after an alternative has been
proposed to it, and not by necessity—the result of an inflexible and
unalterable condition.  Consequently, although death has various issues,
inasmuch as its causes are manifold, we cannot say that the easiest
death is so gentle as not to happen by violence (to our nature). The
very law which produces death, simple though it be, is yet violence. How
can it be otherwise, when so close a companionship of soul and body, so
inseparable a growth together from their very conception of two sister
substances, is sundered and divided? For although a man may breathe his
last for joy, like the Spartan Chilon, while embracing his son who had
just conquered in the Olympic games; or for glory, like the Athenian
Clidemus, while receiving a crown of gold for the excellence of his
historical writings; or in a dream, like Plato; or in a fit of laughter,
like Publius Crassus,—yet death is much too violent, coming as it does
upon us by strange and alien means, expelling the soul by a method all
its own, calling on us to die at a moment when one might live a jocund
life in joy and honour, in peace and pleasure. That is still a violence
to ships: although far away from the Capharean rocks, assailed by no
storms, without a billow to shatter them, with favouring gale, in
gliding course, with merry crews, they founder amidst entire security,
suddenly, owing to some internal shock.  Not dissimilar are the
shipwrecks of life,—the issues of even a tranquil death. It matters not
whether the vessel of the human body goes with unbroken timbers or
shattered with storms, if the navigation of the soul be overthrown.
