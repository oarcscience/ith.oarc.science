<span id="iv.xi.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—The Opinions of Carpocrates,
Another Offset from the Pythagorean Dogmas, Stated and Confuted.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xxxv-p2"></span>However, it is not for you alone,
(Simon), that the transmigration philosophy has fabricated this story.
Carpocrates also makes equally good use of it, who was a magician and a
fornicator like yourself, only he had not a Helen. <span
id="fr_1726"></span>[1727](#fn_1726.md) And why should he not? since he
asserted that souls are reinvested with bodies, in order to ensure the
overthrow by all means of divine and human truth. For, (according to his
miserable doctrine,) this life became consummated to no man until all
those blemishes which are held to disfigure it have been fully displayed
in its conduct; because there is nothing which is accounted evil by
nature, but simply as men think of it.  The transmigration of human
souls, therefore, into any kind of heterogeneous bodies, he thought by
all means indispensable, whenever any depravity whatever had not been
fully perpetrated in the early stage of life’s passage. Evil deeds (one
may be sure) appertain to life. Moreover, as often as the soul has
fallen short as a defaulter in sin, it has to be recalled to existence,
until it “pays the utmost farthing,” <span
id="fr_1727"></span>[1728](#fn_1727.md) thrust out from time to time into
the prison of the body. To this effect does he tamper with the whole of
that allegory of the Lord which is extremely clear and simple in its
meaning, and ought to be from the first understood in its plain and
natural sense. Thus our “adversary” (therein mentioned <span
id="fr_1728"></span>[1729](#fn_1728) .md) is the heathen man, who is
walking with us along the same road of life which is common to him and
ourselves. Now “we must needs go out of the world,” <span
id="fr_1729"></span>[1730](#fn_1729.md) if it be not allowed us to have
conversation with them. He bids us, therefore, show a kindly disposition
to such a man. “Love your enemies,” says He, “pray for them that curse
you,” <span id="fr_1730"></span>[1731](#fn_1730.md) lest such a man in any
transaction of business be irritated by any unjust conduct of yours, and
“deliver thee to the judge” of his own (nation <span
id="fr_1731"></span>[1732](#fn_1731) .md), and you be thrown into prison,
and be detained in its close and narrow cell until you have liquidated
all your debt against him. <span id="fr_1732"></span>[1733](#fn_1732.md)
Then, again, should you be disposed to apply the term “adversary” to the
devil, you are advised by the (Lord’s) injunction, “while you are in the
way with him,” to make even with him such a compact as may be deemed
compatible with the requirements of your true faith. Now the compact you
have made respecting him is to renounce him, and his pomp, and his
angels. Such is your agreement in this matter. Now the friendly
understanding you will have to carry out must arise from your observance
of the compact: you must never think of getting back any of the things
which you have abjured, and have restored to him, lest he should summon
you as a fraudulent man, and a transgressor of your agreement, before
God the Judge (for in this light do we read of him, in another passage,
as “the accuser of the brethren,” <span
id="fr_1733"></span>[1734](#fn_1733.md) or saints, where reference is made
to the actual practice of legal prosecution); and lest this Judge
deliver you over to the angel who is to execute the sentence, and *he*
commit you to the prison of hell, out of which there will be no
dismissal until the smallest even of your delinquencies be paid off in
the period before the resurrection. <span
id="fr_1734"></span>[1735](#fn_1734.md) What can be a more fitting sense
than this? What a truer interpretation? If, however, according to
Carpocrates, the soul is bound to the commission of all sorts of crime
and evil conduct, what must we from his system understand to be its
“adversary” and foe? I suppose it must be that better mind which shall
compel it by force to the performance of some act of virtue, that it may
be driven from body to body, until it be found in none a debtor to the
claims of a virtuous life. This means, that a good tree is known by its
bad fruit—in other words, that the doctrine of truth is understood from
the worst possible precepts.  I apprehend <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735.md) that heretics of this school seize
with especial avidity the example of Elias, whom they assume to have
been so reproduced in John (the Baptist) as to make our Lord’s statement
sponsor for their theory of transmigration, when He said, “Elias is come
already, and they knew him not;” <span
id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736.md) and again, in another passage, “And
if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.” <span
id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737.md) Well, then, was it really in a
Pythagorean sense that the Jews approached John with the inquiry, “Art
thou Elias?” <span id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738.md) and not rather
in the sense of the divine pre<span id="page_217">p. 217</span> <span
id="iv.xi.xxxv-Page_217"></span>diction, “Behold, I will send you
Elijah” the Tisbite? <span id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739.md) The
fact, however, is, that their metempsychosis, or transmigration theory,
signifies the recall of the soul which had died long before, and its
return to some other body. But Elias is to come again, not after
quitting life (in the way of dying), but after his translation (or
removal without dying); not for the purpose of being restored to the
body, from which he had not departed, but for the purpose of revisiting
the world from which he was translated; not by way of resuming a life
which he had laid aside, but of fulfilling prophecy,—really and truly
the same man, both in respect of his name and designation, as well as of
his unchanged humanity. How, therefore could John be Elias? You have
your answer in the angel’s announcement: “And he shall go before the
people,” says he, “in the spirit and power of Elias”—not (observe) in
his soul and his body. These substances are, in fact, the natural
property of each individual; whilst “the spirit and power” are bestowed
as external gifts by the grace of God and so may be transferred to
another person according to the purpose and will of the Almighty, as was
anciently the case with respect to the spirit of Moses. <span
