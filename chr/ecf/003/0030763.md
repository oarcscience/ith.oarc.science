<span id="vi.iv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Of Stations.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix-p2"></span>Similarly, too, touching the days of
Stations, <span id="fr_8866"></span>[8867](#fn_8866) most think that
they must not be present at the sacrificial prayers, on the ground that
the Station must be dissolved by reception of the Lord’s Body. Does,
then, the Eucharist cancel a service devoted to God, or bind it more to
God?  Will not your *Station* be more solemn if you have withal *stood*
at God’s *altar*? <span id="fr_8867"></span>[8868](#fn_8867) When the
Lord’s Body has been received and reserved <span
id="fr_8868"></span>[8869](#fn_8868) each point is secured, both the
participation of the sacrifice and the discharge of duty. If the
“Station” has received its name from the example of military life—for we
withal are God’s military <span id="fr_8869"></span>[8870](#fn_8869) —of
course no gladness or sadness chanting to the camp abolishes the
“stations” of the soldiers: for gladness will carry out discipline more
willingly, sadness more carefully.

<span id="vi.iv.xix-p3"></span> The word *Statio* seems to have been
used in more than one sense in the ancient Church. A passage in the
*Shepherd of Hermas*, referred to above (B. iii. Sim. 5), appears to
make it ="fast.”

your *station* is over.
