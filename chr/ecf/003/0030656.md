<span id="v.ix.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—The Catholic Rule of Faith
Expounded in Some of Its Points.  Especially in the Unconfused
Distinction of the Several Persons of the Blessed Trinity.</span>

<span id="v.ix.ix-p2"></span>Bear always in mind that this is the rule
of faith which I profess; by it I testify that the Father, and the Son,
and the Spirit are inseparable from each other, and so will you know in
what sense this is said. Now, observe, my assertion is that the Father
is one, and the Son one, and the Spirit one, and that They are distinct
from Each Other. This statement is taken in a wrong sense by every
uneducated as well as every perversely disposed person, as if it
predicated a diversity, in such a sense as to imply a separation among
the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit. I am, moreover, obliged to say
this, when (extolling the *Monarchy* at the expense of the *Economy*)
they contend for the identity of the Father and Son and Spirit, that it
is not by way of diversity that the Son differs from the Father, but by
distribution: it is not by division that He is different, but by
distinction; because the Father is not the same as the Son, since they
differ one from the other in the mode of their being. <span
id="fr_7860"></span>[7861](#fn_7860.md) For the Father is the entire
substance, but the Son is a derivation <span id="page_604">p. 604</span>
<span id="v.ix.ix-Page_604"></span>and portion of the whole, <span
id="fr_7861"></span>[7862](#fn_7861.md) as He Himself acknowledges: “My
Father is greater than I.” <span id="fr_7862"></span>[7863](#fn_7862.md) In
the Psalm His inferiority is described as being “a little lower than the
angels.” <span id="fr_7863"></span>[7864](#fn_7863.md) Thus the Father is
distinct from the Son, being greater than the Son, inasmuch as He who
begets is one, and He who is begotten is another; He, too, who sends is
one, and He who is sent is another; and He, again, who makes is one, and
He through whom the thing is made is another. Happily the Lord Himself
employs this expression of the person of the Paraclete, so as to signify
not a division or severance, but a disposition (of mutual relations in
the Godhead); for He says, “I will pray the Father, and He shall send
you another Comforter…even the Spirit of truth,” <span
id="fr_7864"></span>[7865](#fn_7864.md) thus making the Paraclete distinct
from Himself, even as we say that the Son is also distinct from the
Father; so that He showed a third degree in the Paraclete, as we believe
the second degree is in the Son, by reason of the order observed in the
*Economy*. Besides, does not the very fact that they have the distinct
names of *Father* and *Son* amount to a declaration that they are
distinct in personality? <span id="fr_7865"></span>[7866](#fn_7865.md) For,
of course, all things will be what their names represent them to be; and
what they are and ever will be, that will they be called; and the
distinction indicated by the names does not at all admit of any
confusion, because there is none in the things which they designate.
“Yes is yes, and no is no; for what is more than these, cometh of
evil.” <span id="fr_7866"></span>[7867](#fn_7866.md)

<span id="v.ix.ix-p4"></span> “In his representation of the distinction
(of the Persons of the Blessed Trinity), Tertullian sometimes uses
expressions which in aftertimes, when controversy had introduced greater
precision of language, were studiously avoided by the orthodox. Thus he
calls the Father the whole substance, the Son a derivation from or
portion of the whole.” (Bp. Kaye, *On Tertullian*, p. 505).  After
Arius, the language of theology received greater precision; but as it
is, there is no doubt of the orthodoxy of Tertullian’s doctrine, since
he so firmly and ably teaches the Son’s *consubstantiality* with the
Father—equal to Him and inseparable from him. \[In other words,
Tertullian could not employ a technical phraseology afterwards adopted
to give precision to the same orthodox ideas.\]
