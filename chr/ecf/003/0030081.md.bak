<span id="iv.iv.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Written Contracts in the
Name of Idols. Tacit Consent.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>But there is a certain species of that
class, doubly sharpened in deed and word, and mischievous on either
side, although it flatter you, as if it were free of danger in each;
while it does not seem to be a *deed*, because it is not laid hold of as
a *word*. In borrowing money from heathens under pledged <span
id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md) securities, *Christians* give a
guarantee under oath, and deny themselves *to have done so*. Of course,
the time of the prosecution, and the place of the judgment seat, and the
person of the presiding judge, decide that they knew themselves *to have
so done*. <span id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) Christ prescribes that
there is to be no swearing. “I wrote,” says the debtor, “but I said
nothing. It is the tongue, not the written letter, which kills.”  Here I
call Nature and Conscience as my witnesses: Nature, because even if the
*tongue* in dictating remains motionless and quiet, the hand can write
nothing which the *soul* has not dictated; albeit even to the tongue
itself the soul may have dictated either something conceived by itself,
or else something delivered by another. Now, lest it be said, “Another
dictated,” I here appeal to Conscience whether, what another dictated,
the soul entertains, <span id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md) and
transmits unto the hand, whether with the concomitance or the inaction
of the tongue. Enough, that the Lord has said faults are committed in
the mind and the conscience. If concupiscence or malice have ascended
into a man’s heart, He saith it is held as a deed. <span
id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md) You therefore have given a guarantee;
which clearly has “ascended into your heart,” which you can neither
contend you were ignorant of nor unwilling; for when you gave the
guarantee, you knew *that you did it*; when you knew, of course you were
willing: you did it as well in act as in thought; nor can you by the
lighter charge exclude the heavier, <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) so as to say that it is clearly
rendered false, by giving a guarantee for what you do not actually
perform. “Yet I have not denied, because I have not sworn.” *But you
have sworn*, since, even if you had done no such thing, you would still
be said to swear, if you have even *consented* to so doing. Silence of
voice is an unavailing plea in a case of *writing*; and muteness of
sound in a case of *letters*. For Zacharias, when punished with a
temporary privation of *voice*, holds colloquy with his *mind*, and,
passing by his bootless tongue, with the help of his hands dictates from
his heart, and without his mouth pronounces the name of his son. <span
id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) Thus, in his pen there speaks a hand
clearer than every sound, in his waxen tablet there is heard a letter
more vocal that every mouth. <span id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md)
Inquire whether a man have *spoken* who is *understood* to have
spoken. <span id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340.md) Pray we the Lord that no
necessity for that kind of contract may ever encompass us; and if it
*should* so fall out, may He give our brethren the means of helping us,
or give us constancy to break off all *such* necessity, lest those
denying letters, the substitutes for our mouth, be brought forward
against us in the day of judgment, sealed with the seals, not now of
witnesses, but of angels!

<span id="iv.iv.xxiii-p3"></span> Or, “mortgaged.”

<span id="fn_334"></span>[75:335](0030081.htm#fr_334.md) <span
id="iv.iv.xxiii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxiii-p4"></span> This is, perhaps, the most obscure and
difficult passage in the entire treatise. I have followed Oehler’s
reading, and given what appears to be his sense; but the readings are
widely different, and it is doubtful whether any is correct. I can
scarcely, however, help thinking that the “*se negant*” here, and the
“*tamen non negavi*” below, are to be connected with the “*puto autem
nec negare*” at the end of the former chapter; and that the true
rendering is rather: “And \[by so doing\] deny themselves,” *i.e*., deny
their Christian name and faith. “Doubtless a time of persecution,” such
as the present time is—or “of prosecution,” which would make very good
sense—“and the place of the tribunal, and the person of the presiding
judge, require them to *know* themselves,” i.e., to have no shuffling or
disguise. I submit this rendering with diffidence; but it does seem to
me to suit the context better, and to harmonize better with the “Yet I
have not denied,” i.e., my name and faith, which follows, and with the
“denying letters” which are mentioned at the end of the chapter.—<span

id="iv.iv.xxiii-p4.3"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxiii-p5"></span> Mr. Dodgson renders “conceiveth;” and
the word is certainly capable of that meaning.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[75:338](0030081.htm#fr_337.md) <span
id="iv.iv.xxiii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxiii-p7"></span> Oehler understands “the lighter crime”
or “charge” to be “swearing;” the “heavier,” to be “denying the Lord
Christ.”

id="iv.iv.xxiii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxiii-p9"></span> This is how Mr. Dodgson renders, and
the rendering agrees with Oehler’s punctuation. \[So obscure however, is
Dodgson’s rendering that I have slightly changed the punctuation, to
clarify it, and subjoin Oehler’s text.\] But perhaps we may read thus:
“He speaks in his pen; he is heard in his waxen tablet: the hand is
clearer than every sound; the letter is more vocal than every mouth.”
\[Oehler reads thus: “Cum manibus suis a corde dictat et nomen filii
sine ore pronuntiat:  loquitur in stilo, auditur in cera manus omni sono
clarior, littera omni ore vocalior.” I see no difficulty here.\]
