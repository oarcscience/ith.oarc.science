<span id="v.iv.ii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Marcion Forbids Marriage.
Tertullian Eloquently Defends It as Holy, and Carefully Discriminates
Between Marcion’s Doctrine and His Own Montanism.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xxix-p2"></span>The flesh is not, according to
Marcion, immersed in the water of the sacrament, unless it be <span
id="fr_2672"></span>[2673](#fn_2672) in virginity, widowhood, or
celibacy, or has purchased by divorce a title to baptism, as if even
generative impotents <span id="fr_2673"></span>[2674](#fn_2673) did not
all receive their flesh from nuptial union. Now, such a scheme as this
must no doubt involve the proscription of marriage.  Let us see, then,
whether it be a just one: not as if we <span id="page_294">p. 294</span>
<span id="v.iv.ii.xxix-Page_294"></span>aimed at destroying the
happiness of sanctity, as do certain Nicolaitans in their maintenance of
lust and luxury, but as those who have come to the knowledge of
sanctity, and pursue it and prefer it, without detriment, however, to
marriage; not as if we superseded a bad thing by a good, but only a good
thing by a better. For we do not reject marriage, but simply refrain
from it. <span id="fr_2674"></span>[2675](#fn_2674) Nor do we prescribe
sanctity <span id="fr_2675"></span>[2676](#fn_2675) as the rule, but
only recommend it, observing it as a good, yea, even the better state,
if each man uses it carefully <span id="fr_2676"></span>[2677](#fn_2676)
according to his ability; but at the same time earnestly vindicating
marriage, whenever hostile attacks are made against it is a polluted
thing, to the disparagement of the Creator. For He bestowed His blessing
on matrimony also, as on an honourable estate, for the increase of the
human race; as He did indeed on the whole of His creation, <span
id="fr_2677"></span>[2678](#fn_2677) for wholesome and good uses. Meats
and drinks are not on this account to be condemned, because, when served
up with too exquisite a daintiness, they conduce to gluttony; nor is
raiment to be blamed, because, when too costlily adorned, it becomes
inflated with vanity and pride. So, on the same principle, the estate of
matrimony is not to be refused, because, when enjoyed without
moderation, it is fanned into a voluptuous flame. There is a great
difference between a cause and a fault, <span
id="fr_2678"></span>[2679](#fn_2678) between a state and its excess. 
Consequently it is not an institution of this nature that is to be
blamed, but the extravagant use of it; according to the judgment of its
founder Himself, who not only said, “Be fruitful, and multiply,” <span
id="fr_2679"></span>[2680](#fn_2679) but also, “Thou shalt not commit
adultery,” and, “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife;” <span
id="fr_2680"></span>[2681](#fn_2680) and who threatened with death the
unchaste, sacrilegious, and monstrous abomination both of adultery and
unnatural sin with man and beast. <span
id="fr_2681"></span>[2682](#fn_2681) Now, if any limitation is set to
marrying—such as the spiritual rule, <span
id="fr_2682"></span>[2683](#fn_2682) which prescribes but one marriage
under the Christian obedience, <span
id="fr_2683"></span>[2684](#fn_2683) maintained by the authority of the
Paraclete, <span id="fr_2684"></span>[2685](#fn_2684) —it will be His
prerogative to fix the limit Who had once been diffuse in His
permission; His to gather, Who once scattered; His to cut down the tree,
Who planted it; His to reap the harvest, Who sowed the seed; His to
declare, “It remaineth that they who have wives be as though they had
none,” <span id="fr_2685"></span>[2686](#fn_2685) Who once said, “Be
fruitful, and multiply;” His the end to Whom belonged the beginning.
Nevertheless, the tree is not cut down as if it deserved blame; nor is
the corn reaped, as if it were to be condemned,—but simply because their
time is come. So likewise the state of matrimony does not require the
hook and scythe of sanctity, as if it were evil; but as being ripe for
its discharge, and in readiness for that sanctity which will in the long
run bring it a plenteous crop by its reaping.  For this leads me to
remark of Marcion’s god, that in reproaching marriage as an evil and
unchaste thing, he is really prejudicing the cause of that very sanctity
which he seems to serve.  For he destroys the material on which it
subsists; if there is to be no marriage, there is no sanctity. All proof
of abstinence is lost when excess is impossible; for sundry things have
thus their evidence in their contraries.  Just as “strength is made
perfect in weakness,” <span id="fr_2686"></span>[2687](#fn_2686) so
likewise is continence made manifest by the permission to marry. Who
indeed will be called continent, if that be taken away which gives him
the opportunity of pursuing a life of continence? What room for
temperance in appetite does famine give? What repudiation of ambitious
projects does poverty afford?  What bridling of lust can the eunuch
merit? To put a complete stop, however, to the sowing of the human race,
may, for aught I know, be quite consistent for Marcion’s most good and
excellent god.  For how could he desire the salvation of man, whom he
forbids to be born, when he takes away that institution from which his
birth arises? How will he find any one on whom to set the mark of his
goodness, when he suffers him not to come into existence? How is it
possible to love him whose origin he hates? Perhaps he is afraid of a
redundant population, lest he should be weary in liberating so many;
lest he should have to make many heretics; lest Marcionite parents
should produce too many noble disciples of Marcion. The cruelty of
Pharaoh, which slew its victims at their birth, will not prove to be
more inhuman in comparison. <span id="fr_2687"></span>[2688](#fn_2687)
For while he destroyed lives, our heretic’s god refuses to give them:
the one removes from life, the other admits none to it.  There is no
difference in either as to their homicide—man is slain by both of them;
by the former just after birth, by the latter as yet unborn. Thanks
should we owe thee, thou <span id="page_295">p. 295</span> <span
id="v.iv.ii.xxix-Page_295"></span>god of our heretic, hadst thou only
checked <span id="fr_2688"></span>[2689](#fn_2688) the dispensation of
the Creator in uniting male and female; for from such a union indeed has
thy Marcion been born!  Enough, however, of Marcion’s god, who is shown
to have absolutely no existence at all, both by our definitions <span
id="fr_2689"></span>[2690](#fn_2689) of the one only Godhead, and the
condition of his attributes. <span id="fr_2690"></span>[2691](#fn_2690)
The whole course, however, of this little work aims directly at this
conclusion.  If, therefore, we seem to anybody to have achieved but
little result as yet, let him reserve his expectations, until we examine
the very Scripture which Marcion quotes.
