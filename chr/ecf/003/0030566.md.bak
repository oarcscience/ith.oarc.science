<span id="v.vii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Opposite Extravagance
Exposed.  That is Christ with a Soul Composed of Flesh—Corporeal, Though
Invisible. Christ’s Soul, Like Ours, Distinct from Flesh, Though Clothed
in It.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xi-p2"></span>But we meet another argument of theirs,
when we raise the question why Christ, in assuming a flesh composed of
soul, should seem to have had a soul that was made of flesh? For God,
they say, desired to make the soul visible to men, by enduing it with a
bodily nature, although it was before invisible; of its own nature,
indeed, it was incapable of seeing anything, even its own self, by
reason of the obstacle of this flesh, so that it was even a matter of
doubt whether it was born or not.  The soul, therefore (they further
say), was made corporeal in Christ, in order that we might see it when
undergoing birth, and death, and (what is more) resurrection. But yet,
how was this possible, that by means of the flesh the soul should
demonstrate itself <span id="fr_7084"></span>[7085](#fn_7084.md) to itself
or to us, when it could not possibly be ascertained that it would offer
this mode of exhibiting itself by the flesh, until the thing came into
existence to which it was unknown, <span
id="fr_7085"></span>[7086](#fn_7085.md) that is to say, the flesh? It
received darkness, forsooth, in order to be able to shine! Now, <span
id="fr_7086"></span>[7087](#fn_7086.md) let us first turn our attention to
this point, whether it was requisite that the soul should exhibit itself
in the manner contended for; <span id="fr_7087"></span>[7088](#fn_7087.md)
and next *consider* whether their previous position be <span
id="fr_7088"></span>[7089](#fn_7088.md) that the soul is wholly invisible
(inquiring further) whether this invisibility is the result of its
incorporeality, or whether it actually possesses some sort of body
peculiar to itself. And yet, although they say that it is invisible,
they determine it to be corporeal, but having somewhat that is
invisible. For if it has nothing invisible how can it be said to be
invisible? But even its existence is an impossibility, unless it has
that which is instrumental to its existence. <span
id="fr_7089"></span>[7090](#fn_7089.md) Since, however, it exists, it must
needs have a something through which it exists. If it has this
something, it must be its body.  Everything which exists is a bodily
existence *sui generis*.  Nothing lacks bodily existence but that which
is non-existent. If, then, the soul has an invisible body, He who had
proposed to make it <span id="fr_7090"></span>[7091](#fn_7090.md) visible
would certainly have done His work better <span
id="fr_7091"></span>[7092](#fn_7091.md) if He had made that part of it
which was accounted invisible, visible; because then there would have
been no untruth or weakness in the case, and neither of these flaws is
suitable to God. (But as the case stands in the hypothesis) there is
*untruth*, since He has set forth the soul as being a different thing
from what it really is; and there is *weakness*, since He was unable to
make it appear <span id="fr_7092"></span>[7093](#fn_7092.md) to be that
which it is. No one who wishes to exhibit a man covers him with a
veil <span id="fr_7093"></span>[7094](#fn_7093.md) or a mask. This,
however, is precisely what has been done to the soul, if it has been
clothed with a covering belonging to something else, by being converted
into flesh. But even if the soul is, on their hypothesis, supposed <span
id="fr_7094"></span>[7095](#fn_7094.md) to be incorporeal, so that the
soul, whatever it is, should by some *mysterious* force of the
reason <span id="fr_7095"></span>[7096](#fn_7095.md) be quite unknown, only
not be a body, then in that case it were not beyond the power of
God—indeed it would be more consistent with His plan—if He
displayed <span id="fr_7096"></span>[7097](#fn_7096.md) the soul in some
new sort of body, different from that which we all have in common, one
of which we should have quite a different notion, <span
id="fr_7097"></span>[7098](#fn_7097.md) (being spared <span
id="page_532">p. 532</span> <span id="v.vii.xi-Page_532"></span>the idea
that) <span id="fr_7098"></span>[7099](#fn_7098.md) He had set His mind
on <span id="fr_7099"></span>[7100](#fn_7099.md) making, without an
adequate cause, a visible soul instead of <span
id="fr_7100"></span>[7101](#fn_7100.md) an invisible one—a fit incentive,
no doubt, for such questions as they start, <span
id="fr_7101"></span>[7102](#fn_7101.md) by their maintenance of a human
flesh for it. <span id="fr_7102"></span>[7103](#fn_7102.md) Christ,
however, could not have appeared among men except as a man. Restore,
therefore, to Christ, His faith; *believe* that He who willed to walk
the earth as a man exhibited even a soul of a thoroughly human
condition, not making it of flesh, but clothing it with flesh.
