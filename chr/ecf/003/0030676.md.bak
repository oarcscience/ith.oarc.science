<span id="v.ix.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—It Was Christ that Died.  The
Father is Incapable of Suffering Either Solely or with Another.
Blasphemous Conclusions Spring from Praxeas’ Premises.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xxix-p2"></span>Silence! Silence on such blasphemy. Let
us be content with saying that Christ died, the Son of the Father; and
*let this suffice*, because the Scriptures have told us so much. For
even the apostle, to his declaration—which he makes not without feeling
the weight of it—that “Christ died,” immediately adds, “according to the
Scriptures,” <span id="fr_8174"></span>[8175](#fn_8174.md) in order that he
may alleviate the harshness of the statement by the authority of the
Scriptures, and so remove offence from the reader. Now, although when
two substances are alleged to be in Christ—namely, the divine and the
human—<span id="page_626">p. 626</span> <span
id="v.ix.xxix-Page_626"></span>it plainly follows that the divine nature
is immortal, and that which is human is mortal, it is manifest in what
sense he declares “Christ died”—even in the sense in which He was flesh
and Man and the Son of Man, not as being the Spirit and the Word and the
Son of God. In short, since he says that it was *Christ* (that is, the
Anointed One) that died, he shows us that that which died was the nature
which was anointed; in a word, the flesh. Very well, say you; since we
on our side affirm our doctrine in precisely the same terms which you
use on your side respecting the Son, we are not guilty of blasphemy
against the Lord God, for we do not maintain that He died after the
divine nature, but only after the human. Nay, but you do blaspheme;
because you allege not only that the Father died, but that He died the
death of the cross. For “cursed are they which are hanged on a
tree,” <span id="fr_8175"></span>[8176](#fn_8175.md) —a curse which, after
the law, is compatible to the Son (inasmuch as “Christ has been made a
curse for us,” <span id="fr_8176"></span>[8177](#fn_8176.md) but certainly
not the Father); since, however, you convert Christ into the Father, you
are chargeable with blasphemy against the Father. But when we assert
that Christ was crucified, we do not malign Him with a curse; we only
re-affirm <span id="fr_8177"></span>[8178](#fn_8177.md) the curse
pronounced by the law: <span id="fr_8178"></span>[8179](#fn_8178.md) nor
indeed did the apostle utter blasphemy when he said the same thing as
we. <span id="fr_8179"></span>[8180](#fn_8179.md) Besides, as there is no
blasphemy in predicating of the subject that which is fairly applicable
to it; so, on the other hand, it is blasphemy when that is alleged
concerning the subject which is unsuitable to it. On this principle,
too, the Father was not associated in suffering with the Son. *The
heretics*, indeed, fearing to incur direct blasphemy against the Father,
hope to diminish it by this expedient:  they grant us so far that the
Father and the Son are Two; adding that, since it is the Son indeed who
suffers, the Father is only His fellow-sufferer. <span
id="fr_8180"></span>[8181](#fn_8180.md) But how absurd are they even in
this conceit! For what is the meaning of “fellow-suffering,” but the
endurance of suffering along with another? Now if the Father is
incapable of suffering, He. is incapable of suffering in company with
another; otherwise, if He can suffer with another, He is of course
capable of suffering. You, in fact, yield Him nothing by this subterfuge
of your fears. You are afraid to say that He is capable of suffering
whom you make to be capable of fellow-suffering. Then, again, the Father
is as incapable of fellow-suffering as the Son even is of suffering
under the conditions of His existence as God. Well, but how could the
Son suffer, if the Father did not suffer with Him? *My answer is*, The
Father is separate from the Son, though not from *Him as* God. For even
if a river be soiled with mire and mud, although it flows from the
fountain identical in nature with it, and is not separated from the
fountain, yet the injury which affects the stream reaches not to the
fountain; and although it is the water of the fountain which suffers
down the stream, still, since it is not affected at the fountain, but
only in the river, the fountain suffers nothing, but only the river
which issues from the fountain. So likewise the Spirit of God, <span
id="fr_8181"></span>[8182](#fn_8181.md) whatever suffering it might be
capable of in the Son, yet, inasmuch as it could not suffer in the
Father, *the fountain of the Godhead*, but only in the Son, it evidently
could not have suffered, <span id="fr_8182"></span>[8183](#fn_8182.md) as
the Father. But it is enough for me that the Spirit of God suffered
nothing as the Spirit of God, <span id="fr_8183"></span>[8184](#fn_8183.md)
since all that It suffered It suffered in the Son. It was quite another
matter for the Father to suffer with *the Son in the flesh*. This
likewise has been treated by us. Nor will any one deny this, since even
we are ourselves unable to suffer for God, unless the Spirit of God be
in us, who also utters by our instrumentality <span
id="fr_8184"></span>[8185](#fn_8184.md) whatever pertains to our own
conduct and suffering; not, however, that He Himself suffers in our
suffering, only He bestows on us the power and capacity of suffering.
