<span id="vi.vii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Of Revenge.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.x-p2"></span>There is, too, another chief spur of
impatience, the lust of revenge, dealing with the business either of
glory or else of malice. But “glory,” on the one hand, is everywhere
“vain;” <span id="fr_9110"></span>[9111](#fn_9110.md) and malice, on the
other, is always <span id="fr_9111"></span>[9112](#fn_9111.md) odious to
the Lord; in this case indeed most of all, when, being provoked by a
neighbour’s malice, it constitutes itself superior <span
id="fr_9112"></span>[9113](#fn_9112.md) in following out revenge, and by
paying wickedness doubles that which has once been done. Revenge, in the
estimation of error, <span id="fr_9113"></span>[9114](#fn_9113.md) seems a
solace of pain; in the estimation of truth, on the contrary, it is
convicted of malignity. For what difference is there between provoker
and provoked, except that the former is detected as prior in evil-doing,
but the latter as posterior? Yet each stands impeached of hurting a man
in the eye of the Lord, who both prohibits and condemns every
wickedness. In evil doing there is no account taken of *order*, nor does
*place* separate what *similarity* conjoins. And the precept is
absolute, that evil is not to be repaid with evil. <span
id="fr_9114"></span>[9115](#fn_9114.md) Like deed involves like merit. How
shall we observe that principle, if in our loathing <span
id="fr_9115"></span>[9116](#fn_9115.md) we shall not loathe *revenge*? What
honour, moreover, shall we be offering to the Lord God, if we arrogate
to ourselves the arbitrament of vengeance? We are corrupt <span
id="fr_9116"></span>[9117](#fn_9116.md) —earthen vessels. <span
id="fr_9117"></span>[9118](#fn_9117.md) With our own servant-boys, <span
id="fr_9118"></span>[9119](#fn_9118.md) if they assume to themselves the
right of vengeance on their fellow-servants, we are gravely offended;
while such as make us the offering of their patience we not only approve
as mindful of humility, of servitude, affectionately jealous of the
right of their lord’s honour; but we make them an ampler satisfaction
than they would have pre-exacted <span
id="fr_9119"></span>[9120](#fn_9119.md) for themselves. Is there any risk
of a different result in the case of a Lord so just in estimating, so
potent in executing? Why, then, do we believe Him a Judge, if not an
Avenger too? This He promises that He will be to us in return, saying,
“Vengeance *belongeth* to me, and I will avenge;” <span
id="fr_9120"></span>[9121](#fn_9120.md) that is, *Leave* patience to me,
and I will reward patience. For when He says, “Judge not, lest ye be
judged,” <span id="fr_9121"></span>[9122](#fn_9121.md) does He not require
patience? For who will refrain from judging another, but he who shall be
patient in not revenging himself? Who *judges* in order to *pardon*? And
if he shall pardon, still he has taken care to indulge the impatience of
a judger, and has taken away the honour of the one Judge, that is, God.
How many mischances had impatience of this kind been wont to run into!
How oft has it repented of its revenge! How oft has its vehemence been
found worse than the causes which led to it!—inasmuch as nothing
undertaken with impatience can be effected without impetuosity:  nothing
done with impetuosity fails either to stumble, or else to fall
altogether, <span id="page_714">p. 714</span> <span
id="vi.vii.x-Page_714"></span>or else to vanish headlong.  Moreover, if
you avenge yourself too slightly, you will be mad; if too amply, you
will have to bear the burden. <span id="fr_9122"></span>[9123](#fn_9122.md)
What have I to do with vengeance, the measure of which, through
impatience of pain, I am unable to regulate? Whereas, if I shall repose
on patience, I shall not *feel* pain; if I shall not feel pain, I shall
not *desire* to avenge myself.
