<span id="v.iii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—One Has Succeeded in Finding
Definite Truth, When He Believes. Heretical Wits are Always Offering
Many Things for Vain Discussion, But We are Not to Be Always
Seeking.</span>

<span id="v.iii.x-p2"></span>Now the reason of this saying is comprised
in three points: in the matter, in the time, in the limit. <span
id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968) In the matter, so that you must
consider *what it is* you have to seek; in the time, *when* you have to
seek; in the limit, *how long*. What you have “to seek,” then, is that
which Christ has taught, <span id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969) (and
you must go on seeking) of course for such time as you fail to
find, <span id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970) —until indeed you
find <span id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971) it. But you have
succeeded in finding <span id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972) when you
have believed. For you would not have believed if you had not found; as
neither would you have sought except with a view to find. Your object,
therefore, in seeking *was* to find; and your object in finding *was* to
believe. All further delay for seeking and finding you have
prevented <span id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973) by believing. The
very fruit of your seeking has determined for you this limit.  This
boundary <span id="fr_1974"></span>[1975](#fn_1974) has He set for you
Himself, who is unwilling that you should believe anything else than
what He has taught, or, therefore, even seek for it. If, however,
because so many other things have been taught by one and another, we are
on that account bound to go on seeking, so long as we are able to find
anything, we must (at that rate) be ever seeking, and never believe
anything at all. For where shall be the end of seeking? where the
stop <span id="fr_1975"></span>[1976](#fn_1975) in believing? where the
completion in finding?  (Shall it be) with Marcion? But even Valentinus
proposes (to us the) maxim, “Seek, and ye shall find.” (Then shall it
be) with Valentinus? Well, but Apelles, too, will assail me with the
same quotation; Hebion also, and Simon, and all in turn, have no other
argument wherewithal to entice me, and draw me over to their side. Thus
I shall be nowhere, and still be encountering <span
id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976) (that challenge), “Seek, and ye
shall find,” precisely as if I had no resting-place; <span
id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977) as if (indeed) I had never found
that which Christ has taught—that which ought <span
id="fr_1978"></span>[1979](#fn_1978) to be sought, that which must
needs <span id="fr_1979"></span>[1980](#fn_1979) be believed.

<span id="v.iii.x-p12"></span> This is the rendering of Oehler’s text,
“et velut si nusquam. There are other readings of this obscure passage,
of which as we add the two most intelligible. The *Codex Agobardinus*
has, “et velim si nunquam;” that is, “and I would that I were nowhere,”
with no fixed belief—in such wise as never to have had the truth; not,
as must now be, to have forfeited it. (Dodgson).  This seems
far-fetched, and inferior to the reading of Pamelius and his <span
class="sc"><span id="v.iii.x-p12.2"></span>mss.</span>:  “et velint me
sic esse nusquam;”—or (as Semler puts it) “velint sic nusquam;” i.e.,
“and they (the heretics) would wish me to be nowhere”—without the fixed
faith of the Catholic. This makes good sense. \[Semler is here
mentioned, and if anybody wishes to understand what sort of editor he
was, he may be greatly amused by Kaye’s examination of some of his
positions, pp. 64–84. Elucidation II.\]
