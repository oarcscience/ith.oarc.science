<span id="iv.iii.xliv-p2"></span>Yes, and no one considers what the loss
is to the common weal,—a loss as great as it is real, no one estimates
the injury entailed upon the state, when, men of virtue as we are, we
are put to death in such numbers; when so many of the truly good suffer
the last penalty. And here we call your own acts to witness, you who are
daily presiding at the trials of prisoners, and passing sentence upon
crimes. Well, in your long lists of those ac<span id="page_50">p.

various atrocities, has any assassin, any cutpurse, any man guilty of
sacrilege, or seduction, or stealing bathers’ clothes, his name entered
as being a Christian too? Or when Christians are brought before you on
the mere ground of their name, is there ever found among them an
ill-doer of the sort? It is always with your folk the prison is
steaming, the mines are sighing, the wild beasts are fed: it is from you
the exhibitors of gladiatorial shows always get their herds of criminals
to feed up for the occasion. You find no Christian there, except simply
as being such; or if one is there as something else, a Christian he is
no longer. <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md)
