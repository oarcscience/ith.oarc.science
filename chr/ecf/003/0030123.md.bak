<span id="iv.vi.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.viii-p2"></span>Hold fast in the meantime this
persuasion, while I examine a question which comes in our way. For I
already hear it is said, that many other things as well as crowns have
been invented by those whom the world believes to be gods, and that they
are notwithstanding to be met with both in our present usages and in
those of early saints, and in the service of God, and in Christ Himself,
who did His work as man by no other than these ordinary
instrumentalities of human life. Well, let it be so; nor shall I inquire
any further back into the origin of this things. Let Mercury have been
the first who taught the knowledge of letters; I will own that they are
requisite both for the business and commerce of life, and for performing
our devotion to God. Nay, if he also first strung the chord to give
forth melody, I will not deny, when listening to David, that this
invention has been in use with the saints, and has ministered to God.
Let Æsculapius have been the first who sought and discovered cures:
Esaias <span id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402.md) mentions that he ordered
Hezekiah medicine when he was sick. Paul, too, knows that a little wine
does the stomach good. <span id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md) Let
Minerva have been the first who built a ship: I shall see Jonah and the
apostles sailing. Nay, there is more than this: for even Christ, we
shall find, has ordinary rai<span id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span
id="iv.vi.viii-Page_98"></span>ment; Paul, too, has his cloak. <span
id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md) If at once, of every article of
furniture and each household vessel, you name some god of the world as
the originator, well, I must recognise Christ, both as He reclines on a
couch, and when He presents a basin for the feet of His disciples, and
when He pours water into it from a ewer, and when He is girt about with
a linen towel <span id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md) —a garment
specially sacred to Osiris. It is thus in general I reply upon the
point, admitting indeed that we use along with others these articles,
but challenging that this be judged in the light of the distinction
between things agreeable and things opposed to reason, because the
promiscuous employment of them is deceptive, concealing the corruption
of the creature, by which it has been made subject to vanity. For we
affirm that those things only are proper to be used, whether by
ourselves or by those who lived before us, and alone befit the service
of God and Christ Himself, which to meet the necessities of human life
supply what is simply; useful and affords real assistance and honourable
comfort, so that they may be well believed to have come from God’s own
inspiration, who first of all no doubt provided for and taught and
ministered to the enjoyment, I should suppose, of His own man. As for
the things which are out of this class, they are not fit to be used
among us, especially those which on that account indeed are not to be
found either with the world, or in the ways of Christ.
