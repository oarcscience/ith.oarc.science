<span id="v.viii.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—Christ’s Assertion About
the Unprofitableness of the Flesh Explained Consistently with Our
Doctrine.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxxvii-p2"></span>He says, it is true, that “the flesh
profiteth nothing;” <span id="fr_7524"></span>[7525](#fn_7524.md) but then,
as in the former case, the meaning must be regulated by the subject
which is spoken of. Now, because they thought His discourse was harsh
and intolerable, supposing that He had really and literally enjoined on
them to eat his flesh, He, with the view of ordering the state of
salvation as a spiritual thing, set out with the principle, “It is the
spirit that quickeneth;” and then added, “The flesh profiteth
nothing,”—meaning, of course, to the giving of life. He also goes on to
explain what He would have us to understand by *spirit*: “The words that
I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.” In a like sense
He had previously said: “He that heareth my words, and believeth on Him
that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into
condemnation, but shall pass from death unto life.” <span
id="fr_7525"></span>[7526](#fn_7525.md) Constituting, therefore, His word
as the life-giving principle, because that word is spirit and life, He
likewise called His flesh by the same appellation; because, too, the
Word had become flesh, <span id="fr_7526"></span>[7527](#fn_7526.md) we
ought therefore to desire Him in order that we may have life, and to
devour Him with the ear, and to ruminate on Him with the understanding,
and to digest Him by faith. Now, just before (the passage in hand), He
had declared His flesh to be “the bread which cometh down from
heaven,” <span id="fr_7527"></span>[7528](#fn_7527.md) impressing on (His
hearers) constantly under the figure of necessary food the memory of
their forefathers, who had preferred the bread and flesh of Egypt to
their divine calling. <span id="fr_7528"></span>[7529](#fn_7528.md) Then,
turning His subject to their reflections, because He perceived that they
were going to be scattered from Him, He says: “The flesh profiteth
nothing.” Now what is there to destroy the resurrection of the flesh? As
if there might not reasonably enough be something which, although it
“profiteth nothing” itself, might yet be capable of being profited by
something else. The spirit “profiteth,” for it imparts life. The flesh
profiteth nothing, for it is subject to death. Therefore He has rather
put the two propositions in a way which favours our belief: for by
showing what “profits,” and what “does not profit,” He has likewise
thrown light on the object which receives as well as the subject which
gives the “profit.”  Thus, *in the present instance, we have* the Spirit
giving life to the flesh which has been subdued by death; for “the
hour,” says He, “is coming, when the dead shall hear the voice of the
Son of God, and they that hear shall live.” <span
id="fr_7529"></span>[7530](#fn_7529.md) Now, what is “the dead” but the
flesh? and what is “the voice of God” but the Word? and what is the Word
but the Spirit, <span id="fr_7530"></span>[7531](#fn_7530.md) who shall
justly raise the flesh which He had once Himself become, and *that* too
from death, which He Himself suffered, and from the grave, which He
Himself once entered? Then again, when He says, “Marvel not at this: for
the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear the
voice of the Son of God, and shall come forth; they that have done good,
to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
resurrection of damnation,” <span id="fr_7531"></span>[7532](#fn_7531.md)
—none will after such words be able to interpret the dead “that are in
the graves” as any other than the bodies of the flesh, because the
graves themselves are nothing but the resting-place of corpses:  for it
is incontestable that even those who partake of “the old man,” that is
to say, sinful men—in other words, those who are dead through their
ignorance of God (whom our heretics, forsooth, foolishly insist on
understanding by the word “graves” <span
id="fr_7532"></span>[7533](#fn_7532) .md)—are plainly here spoken of as
having to come from their graves for judgment. But how are graves to
come forth from graves?
