Now the Sex of Bythus Was an Object of Dispute; Now His Rank Comes in
Question.  Absurd Substitutes for Bythus Criticised by
Tertullian.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxv-p2"></span>There are some who do not claim the first
place for Bythus, but only a lower one. They put their Ogdoad in the
foremost rank; itself, however, derived from a Tetrad, but under
different names. For they put Pro-arche (*Before the Beginning*) first,
Anennœtos (*Inconceivable*) second, Arrhetos (*Indescribable*) third,
Aoratos (*Invisible*) fourth. Then after Pro-arche they say Arche
(*Beginning*) came forth and occupied the first and the fifth place;
from Anennœtos came Acataleptos (*Incomprehensible*) in the second and
the sixth place; from Arrhetos came Anonomastos (*Nameless*) in the
third and the seventh place; from Aoratos <span
id="fr_6918"></span>[6919](#fn_6918) came Agennetos (*Unbegotten*.md) in
the fourth and the eight place. Now by what method he arranges this,
that each of these Æons should be born in two places, and that, too, at
such intervals, I prefer to be ignorant of than to be informed. For what
can be right in a system which is propounded with such absurd
particulars?

Latin synonyme, *Invisibilis*.
