<span id="iv.ix.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.ix.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Law Anterior to Moses.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p2"></span>Stand we, therefore, foot to foot, and
determine we the sum and substance of the actual question within
definite lists.

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p3"></span>For why should God, the founder of the
universe, the Governor of the whole world, <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138) the Fashioner of humanity, the
Sower <span id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139) of universal nations be
believed to have given a law through Moses to one people, and not be
said to have assigned it to all nations? For unless He had given it to
all by no means would He have habitually permitted even proselytes out
of the nations to have access to it. But—as is congruous with the
goodness of God, and with His equity, as the Fashioner of mankind—He
gave to all nations the selfsame law, which at definite and stated times
He enjoined should be observed, when He willed, and through whom He
willed, and as He willed. For in the beginning of the world He gave to
Adam himself and Eve a law, that they were not to eat of the fruit of
the tree planted in the midst of paradise; but that, if they did
contrariwise, by death they were to die. <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140) Which law had continued enough for
them, had it been kept. For in this law given to Adam we recognise in
embryo <span id="fr_1141"></span>[1142](#fn_1141) all the precepts which
afterwards sprouted forth when given through Moses; that is, Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart and out of thy whole soul;
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142) Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not
commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; False witness thou shalt not
utter; Honour thy father and mother; and, That which is another’s, shalt
thou not covet.  For the primordial law was given to Adam and Eve in
paradise, as the womb of all the precepts of God. In short, if they had
loved the Lord their God, they would not have contravened His precept;
if they had habitually loved their neighbour—that is, themselves <span
id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143) —they would not have believed the
persuasion of the serpent, and thus would not have committed murder upon
themselves, <span id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144) by falling <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145) from immortality, by contravening
God’s precept; from theft also they would have abstained, if they had
not stealthily tasted of the fruit of the tree, nor had been anxious to
skulk beneath a tree to escape the view of the Lord their God; nor would
they have been made partners with the falsehood-asseverating devil, by
believing him that they would be “like God;” and thus they would not
have offended God either, as their Father, who had fashioned them from
clay of the earth, as out of the womb of a mother; if they had not
coveted another’s, they would not have tasted of the unlawful fruit.

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p12"></span>Therefore, in this general and primordial
law of God, the observance of which, in the case of the tree’s fruit, He
had sanctioned, we recognise *en*closed all the precepts specially of
the posterior Law, which germinated when *dis*closed at their proper
times. For the subsequent superinduction of a law is the work of the
same Being who had before premised a precept; since it is His province
withal subsequently to train, who had before resolved to form, righteous
creatures. For what wonder if He extends a discipline who institutes it?
if He advances who begins? In short, before the Law of Moses, <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146) written in stone-tables, I contend
that there was a law unwritten, which was habitually understood
naturally, and by the fathers was habitually kept. For whence was Noah
“found righteous,” <span id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147) if in his
case the righteousness of a natural law had not preceded? Whence was
Abraham accounted “a friend of God,” <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148) if not on the ground of equity and
righteousness, (in the observance) of a natural law? Whence was
Melchizedek named “priest of the most high God,” <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149) if, <span id="page_153">p.
153</span> <span id="iv.ix.ii-Page_153"></span>before the priesthood of
the Levitical law, there were not levites who were wont to offer
sacrifices to God?  For thus, after the above-mentioned patriarchs, was
the Law given to Moses, at that (well-known) time after their exode from
Egypt, after the interval and spaces of four hundred years.  In fact, it
was after Abraham’s “four hundred and thirty years” <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150) that the Law was given. Whence we
understand that God’s law was anterior even to Moses, and was not first
(given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the desert, but was more ancient;
(existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs,
and so again for the Jews, at definite periods: so that we are not to
give heed to Moses’ Law as to the primitive law, but as to a subsequent,
which at a definite period God has set forth to the Gentiles too and,
after repeatedly promising so to do through the prophets, has reformed
for the better; and has premonished that it should come to pass that,
just as “the law was given through Moses” <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151) at a definite time, so it should be
believed to have been temporarily observed and kept. And let us not
annul this power which God has, which reforms the law’s precepts
answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man’s
salvation. In fine, let him who contends that the Sabbath is still to be
observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision on the eighth day
because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past,
righteous men kept the Sabbath, or practised circumcision, and were thus
rendered “friends of God.” For if circumcision purges a man since God
made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not circumcise him, even after his
sinning, if circumcision purges? At all events, in settling him in
paradise, He appointed one uncircumcised as colonist of paradise.
Therefore, since God originated Adam uncircumcised, and inobservant of
the Sabbath, consequently his offspring also, Abel, offering Him
sacrifices, uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was by Him
commended; while He accepted <span id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152)
what he was offering in simplicity of heart, and reprobated the
sacrifice of his brother Cain, who was not rightly dividing what he was
offering. <span id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153) Noah also,
uncircumcised—yes, and inobservant of the Sabbath—God freed from the
deluge. <span id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154) For Enoch, too, most
righteous man, uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, He
translated from this world; <span id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155)
who did not first taste <span id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156)
death, in order that, being a candidate for eternal life, <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157) he might by this time show us that
we also may, without the burden of the law of Moses, please God.
Melchizedek also, “the priest of the most high God,” uncircumcised and
inobservant of the Sabbath, was chosen to the priesthood of God. <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158) Lot, withal, the brother <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[1160](#fn_1159) of Abraham, proves that it was for
the merits of righteousness, without observance of the law, that he was
freed from the conflagration of the Sodomites. <span
