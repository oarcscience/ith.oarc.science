<span id="iv.xi.lvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.lvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVI.—Refutation of the Homeric View
of the Soul’s Detention from Hades Owing to the Body’s Being Unburied.
That Souls Prematurely Separated from the Body Had to Wait for Admission
into Hades Also Refuted.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.lvi-p2"></span>There arises the question, whether this
takes place immediately after the soul’s de<span id="page_232">p.
232</span> <span id="iv.xi.lvi-Page_232"></span>parture from the body;
whether some souls are detained for special reasons in the meantime here
on earth; and whether it is permitted them of their own accord, or by
the intervention of authority, to be removed from Hades <span
id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812.md) at some subsequent time? Even such
opinions as these are not by any means lacking persons to advance them
with confidence. It was believed that the unburied dead were not
admitted into the infernal regions before they had received a proper
sepulture; as in the case of Homer’s Patroclus, who earnestly asks for a
burial of Achilles in a dream, on the ground that he could not enter
Hades through any other portal, since the souls of the sepulchred dead
kept thrusting him away. <span id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813.md) We
know that Homer exhibited more than a poetic licence here; he had in
view the rights of the dead. Proportioned, indeed, to his care for the
just honours of the tomb, was his censure of that delay of burial which
was injurious to souls. (It was also his purpose to add a warning), that
no man should, by detaining in his house the corpse of a friend, only
expose himself, along with the deceased, to increased injury and
trouble, by the irregularity <span id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814.md)
of the consolation which he nourishes with pain and grief. He has
accordingly kept a twofold object in view in picturing the complaints of
an unburied soul: he wished to maintain honour to the dead by promptly
attending to their funeral, as well as to moderate the feelings of grief
which their memory excited. But, after all, how vain is it to suppose
that the soul could bear the rites and requirements of the body, or
carry any of them away to the infernal regions! And how much vainer
still is it, if injury be supposed to accrue to the soul from that
neglect of burial which it ought to receive rather as a favour!  For
surely the soul which had no willingness to die might well prefer as
tardy a removal to Hades as possible. It will love the undutiful heir,
by whose means it still enjoys the light. If, however, it is certain
that injury accrues to the soul from a tardy interment of the body—and
the gist of the injury lies in the neglect of the burial—it is yet in
the highest degree unfair, that that should receive all the injury to
which the faulty delay could not possibly be imputed, for of course all
the fault rests on the nearest relations of the dead. They also say that
those souls which are taken away by a premature death wander about
hither and thither until they have completed the residue of the years
which they would have lived through, had it not been for their untimely
fate. Now either their days are appointed to all men severally, and if
so appointed, I cannot suppose them capable of being shortened; or if,
notwithstanding such appointment, they may be shortened by the will of
God, or some other powerful influence, then (I say) such shortening is
of no validity, if they still may be accomplished in some other way. If,
on the other hand, they are not appointed, there cannot be any residue
to be fulfilled for unappointed periods. I have another remark to make.
Suppose it be an infant that dies yet hanging on the breast; or it may
be an immature boy; or it may be, once more, a youth arrived at
puberty:  suppose, moreover, that the life in each case ought to have
reached full eighty years, how is it possible that the soul of either
could spend the whole of the shortened years here on earth after losing
the body by death? One’s age cannot be passed without one’s body, it
being by help of the body that the period of life has its duties and
labours transacted. Let our own people, moreover, bear this in mind,
that souls are to receive back at the resurrection the self-same bodies
in which they died.  Therefore our bodies must be expected to resume the
same conditions and the same ages, for it is these particulars which
impart to bodies their especial modes. By what means, then, can the soul
of an infant so spend on earth its residue of years, that it should be
able at the resurrection to assume the state of an octogenarian,
although it had barely lived a month? Or if it shall be necessary that
the appointed days of life be fulfilled here on earth, must the same
course of life in all its vicissitudes, which has been itself ordained
to accompany the appointed days, be also passed through by the soul
along with the days? Must it employ itself in school studies in its
passage from infancy to boyhood; play the soldier in the excitement and
vigour of youth and earlier manhood; and encounter serious and judicial
responsibilities in the graver years between ripe manhood and old age?
Must it ply trade for profit, turn up the soil with hoe and plough, go
to sea, bring actions at law, get married, toil and labour, undergo
illnesses, and whatever casualties of weal and woe await it in the lapse
of years? Well, but how are all these transactions to be managed without
one’s body? Life (spent) without life? But (you will tell me) the
destined period in question is to be bare of all incident whatever, only
to be accomplished by merely elapsing. What, then, is to prevent its
being fulfilled in Hades, where there is absolutely no use to which you
can apply it? We therefore maintain that every soul, whatever be its age
on quitting the <span id="page_233">p. 233</span> <span
id="iv.xi.lvi-Page_233"></span>body, remains unchanged in the same,
until the time shall come when the promised perfection shall be realized
in a state duly tempered to the measure of the peerless angels. Hence
those souls must be accounted as passing an exile in Hades, which people
are apt to regard as carried off by violence, especially by cruel
tortures, such as those of the cross, and the axe, and the sword, and
the lion; but we do not account those to be violent deaths which justice
awards, that avenger of violence.  So then, you will say, it is all the
wicked souls that are banished in Hades. (Not quite so fast, is my
answer.) I must compel you to determine (what you mean by Hades), which
of its two regions, the region of the good or of the bad. If you mean
the bad, (all I can say is, that) even now the souls of the wicked
deserve to be consigned to those abodes; if you mean the good why should
you judge to be unworthy of such a resting-place the souls of infants
and of virgins, and <span id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815.md) those
which, by reason of their condition in life were pure and innocent?
