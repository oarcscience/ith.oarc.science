<span id="v.iv.iii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Marcion’s Own Antitheses,
If Only the Title and Object of the Work Be Excepted, Afford Proofs of
the Consistent Attributes of the True God.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xxix-p2"></span>But I would have attacked Marcion’s
own *Antitheses* in closer and fuller combat, if a more elaborate
demolition of them were required in maintaining for the Creator the
character of a good God and a Judge, after <span
id="fr_3078"></span>[3079](#fn_3078.md) the examples of both points, which
we have shown to be so worthy of God. Since, however, these two
attributes of goodness and justice do together make up the proper
fulness of the Divine Being as omnipotent, I am able to content myself
with having now compendiously refuted his *Antitheses*, which aim at
drawing distinctions out of the qualities of the (Creator’s)
artifices, <span id="fr_3079"></span>[3080](#fn_3079.md) or of His laws, or
of His great works; and thus sundering Christ from the Creator, as the
most Good from the Judge, as One who is merciful from Him who is
ruthless, and One who brings salvation from Him who causes ruin. The
truth is, <span id="fr_3080"></span>[3081](#fn_3080.md) they <span
id="fr_3081"></span>[3082](#fn_3081.md) rather unite the two Beings whom
they arrange in those diversities (of attribute), which yet are
compatible in God.  For only take away the title of Marcion’s
book, <span id="fr_3082"></span>[3083](#fn_3082.md) and the intention and
purpose of the work itself, and you could get no better demonstration
that the self-same God was both very good and a Judge, inasmuch as these
two characters are only competently found in God. Indeed, the very
effort which is made in the selected examples to oppose Christ to the
Creator, conduces all the more to their union. For so entirely one and
the same was the nature of the Divine Beings, the good and the severe,
as shown both by the same examples and in similar proofs, that It willed
to display Its goodness to those on whom It had first inflicted Its
severity. The difference in time was no matter of surprise, when the
same God was afterwards merciful in presence of evils which had been
subdued, <span id="fr_3083"></span>[3084](#fn_3083.md) who had once been so
austere whilst they were as yet unsubdued. Thus, by help of the
*Antitheses*, the dispensation of the Creator can be more readily shown
to have been *reformed* by Christ, rather than *destroyed;* <span
id="fr_3084"></span>[3085](#fn_3084.md) *restored*, rather than
*abolished*; <span id="fr_3085"></span>[3086](#fn_3085.md) especially as
you sever your own god from everything like acrimonious conduct, <span
id="fr_3086"></span>[3087](#fn_3086.md) even from all rivalry whatsoever
with the Creator. Now, since this is the case, how comes it to pass that
the *Antitheses* demonstrate Him to have been the Creator’s rival in
every disputed cause? <span id="fr_3087"></span>[3088](#fn_3087.md) Well,
even here, too, I will allow that in these causes my God has been a
jealous God, who has in His own right taken especial care that all
things done by Him should be in their beginning of a robuster
growth; <span id="fr_3088"></span>[3089](#fn_3088.md) and this in the way
of a good, because rational <span id="fr_3089"></span>[3090](#fn_3089.md)
emulation, which tends to maturity. In this sense the world itself will
acknowledge His “antitheses,” from the contrariety of its own elements,
although it has been regulated with the very highest reason. <span
id="fr_3090"></span>[3091](#fn_3090.md) Wherefore, most thoughtless
Marcion, it was your duty to have shown that one (of the two Gods you
teach) was a God of light, and the other a God of darkness; and then you
would have found it an easier task to persuade us that one was a God of
goodness, the other a God of severity. How ever, the “antithesis” (or
variety of administration) will rightly be His property, to whom it
actually belongs in (the government of) the world.

Marcion in it had set passages out of the O.T. and the N.T. in
opposition to each other, intending his readers to infer from the
apparent disagreement that the law and the gospel were not from the same
author (Bp. Kaye on Tertullian, p. 468).
