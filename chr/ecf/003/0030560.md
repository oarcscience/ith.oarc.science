<span id="v.vii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Christ Truly Lived and Died in Human
Flesh. Incidents of His Human Life on Earth, and Refutation of Marcion’s
Docetic Parody of the Same.</span>

<span id="v.vii.v-p2"></span>There are, to be sure, other things also
quite as foolish (as the birth of Christ), which have reference to the
humiliations and sufferings of God.  Or else, let them call a crucified
God “wisdom.” But Marcion will apply the knife <span
id="fr_7000"></span>[7001](#fn_7000.md) to this *doctrine* also, and even
with greater reason. For which is more unworthy of God, which is more
likely to raise a blush of shame, that *God* should be born, or that He
should die? that He should bear the flesh, or the cross? be circumcised,
or be crucified? be cradled, or be coffined? <span
id="fr_7001"></span>[7002](#fn_7001.md) be laid in a manger, or in a tomb?
*Talk of* “*wisdom*!” You will show more of *that* if you refuse to
believe this also. But, after all, you will not be “wise” unless you
become a “fool” to the world, by believing “the foolish things of God.”
Have you, then, cut away <span id="fr_7002"></span>[7003](#fn_7002.md) all
sufferings from Christ, on the ground that, as a mere phantom, He was
incapable of experiencing them? We have said above that He might
possibly have undergone the unreal mockeries <span
id="fr_7003"></span>[7004](#fn_7003.md) of an imaginary birth and infancy.
But answer me at once, you that murder truth:  Was not God really
crucified?  And, having been really crucified, did He not really die?
And, having indeed really died, did He not really rise again? Falsely
did Paul <span id="fr_7004"></span>[7005](#fn_7004.md) “determine to know
nothing amongst us but Jesus and Him crucified;” <span
id="fr_7005"></span>[7006](#fn_7005.md) falsely has he impressed upon us
that He was buried; falsely inculcated that He rose again. False,
therefore, is our faith also. And all that we hope for from Christ will
be a phantom. O thou most infamous of men, who acquittest of all
guilt <span id="fr_7006"></span>[7007](#fn_7006.md) the murderers of God!
For nothing did Christ suffer from them, if He really suffered nothing
at all. Spare the whole world’s one only hope, thou who art destroying
the indispensable dishonour of our faith. <span
id="fr_7007"></span>[7008](#fn_7007.md) Whatsoever is unworthy of God, is
of gain to me. I am safe, if I am not ashamed of my Lord. “Whosoever,”
says He, “shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.” <span
id="fr_7008"></span>[7009](#fn_7008.md) Other matters for shame find I none
which can prove me to be shameless in a good sense, and foolish in a
happy one, by my own contempt of shame. The Son of God was crucified; I
am not ashamed because men must needs be ashamed *of it*.  And the Son
of God died; it is by all means to be believed, because it is
absurd. <span id="fr_7009"></span>[7010](#fn_7009.md) And He was buried,
and rose again; the fact is certain, because it is impossible.  But how
will all this be true in Him, if He was not Himself true—if He really
had not in Himself that which might be crucified, might die, might be
buried, and might rise again? *I mean* this flesh suffused with blood,
built up with bones, interwoven with nerves, entwined with veins, *a
flesh* which knew how to be born, and how to die, human without doubt,
as born of a human being. It will therefore be mortal in Christ, because
Christ is man and the Son of man.  Else why is Christ man and the Son of
man, if he has nothing of man, and nothing from man? Unless it be either
that man is anything else than flesh, or man’s flesh comes from any
other source than man, or Mary is anything else than a human being, or
Marcion’s man is *as* Marcion’s god. <span
id="fr_7010"></span>[7011](#fn_7010.md) Otherwise Christ could not be
described as being man without flesh, nor the Son of man without any
human parent; just as He is not God without the Spirit of God, nor the
Son of God without having God for His father. Thus the nature <span
id="fr_7011"></span>[7012](#fn_7011.md) of the two substances displayed Him
as man and God,—in one respect born, in the other unborn; in one respect
fleshly, in the other spiritual; in one sense weak, in the other
exceeding strong; in one sense dying, in the other living. This property
of the two states—the divine and the human—is distinctly asserted <span
id="fr_7012"></span>[7013](#fn_7012.md) with equal truth of both natures
alike, with the same belief both in respect of the Spirit <span
id="fr_7013"></span>[7014](#fn_7013.md) and of the flesh. The powers of the
Spirit, <span id="fr_7014"></span>[7015](#fn_7014.md) proved Him to be God,
His sufferings attested the flesh of man. If His powers were not without
the Spirit <span id="fr_7015"></span>[7016](#fn_7015.md) in like manner,
were not His sufferings without the flesh. If His flesh with its
sufferings was fictitious, for the same reason was the Spirit false with
all its powers. Wherefore halve <span
id="fr_7016"></span>[7017](#fn_7016.md) Christ with a lie? He was wholly
the truth. Believe me, He chose <span id="page_526">p. 526</span> <span
id="v.vii.v-Page_526"></span>rather to be born, than in any part to
pretend—and that indeed to His own detriment—that He was bearing about a
flesh hardened without bones, solid without muscles, bloody without
blood, clothed without the tunic *of skin*, <span
id="fr_7017"></span>[7018](#fn_7017.md) hungry without appetite, eating
without teeth, speaking without a tongue, so that His word was a phantom
to the ears through an imaginary voice. A phantom, too, it was of course
after the resurrection, when, showing His hands and His feet for the
disciples to examine, He said, “Behold and see that it is I myself, for
a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have;” <span
id="fr_7018"></span>[7019](#fn_7018.md) without doubt, hands, and feet, and
bones are not what a spirit possesses, but *only* the flesh. How do you
interpret this statement, Marcion, you who tell us that Jesus comes only
from the most excellent God, who is both simple and good? See how He
*rather* cheats, and deceives, and juggles the eyes of all, and the
senses of all, as well as their access to and contact with Him! You
ought rather to have brought Christ down, not from heaven, but from some
troop of mountebanks, not as God besides man, but simply as a man, a
magician; not as the High Priest of our salvation, but as the conjurer
in a show; not as the raiser of the dead, but as the misleader <span
id="fr_7019"></span>[7020](#fn_7019.md) of the living,—except that, if He
were a magician, He must have had a nativity!
