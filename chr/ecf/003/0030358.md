<span id="v.iv.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Evil of Two Kinds, Penal and
Criminal. It is Not of the Latter Sort that God is the Author, But Only
of the Former, Which are Penal, and Included in His Justice.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xiv-p2"></span>On all occasions does God meet you: it
is He who smites, but also heals; who kills, but also makes alive; who
humbles, and yet exalts; who “creates <span
id="fr_2866"></span>[2867](#fn_2866.md) evil,” but also “makes
peace;” <span id="fr_2867"></span>[2868](#fn_2867.md) —so that from these
very (contrasts of His providence) I may get an answer to the heretics.
Behold, they say, how He acknowledges Himself to be the creator of evil
in the passage, “It is I who create evil.” They take a word whose one
form reduces to confusion and ambiguity two kinds of evils (because both
sins and punishments are called *evils*), and will have Him in every
passage to be understood as the creator of all evil things, in order
that He may be designated the author of evil. We, on the contrary,
distinguish between the two meanings of the word in question, and, by
separating evils of sin from penal evils, *mala culpæ* from *mala pœnæ*,
confine to each of the two classes its own author,—the devil as the
author of the sinful evils (*culpæ*), and God as the creator of penal
evils (*pœnæ*); so that the one class shall be accounted as morally bad,
and the other be classed as the operations of justice passing penal
sentences against the evils of sin.  Of the latter class of evils which
are compatible with justice, God is therefore avowedly the creator. They
are, no doubt, evil to those by whom they are endured, but still on
their own account good, as being just and defensive of good and hostile
to sin. In this respect they are, moreover, worthy of God. Else prove
them to be unjust, in order to show them deserving of a place in the
sinful class, that is to say, evils of injustice; because if they turn
out to belong to justice, they will be no longer evil things, but
good—evil only to the bad, by whom even directly good things are
condemned as evil. In this case, you must decide that man, although the
wilful contemner of the divine law, unjustly bore the doom which he
would like to have escaped; that the wickedness of those days was
unjustly smitten by the deluge, afterwards by the fire (of Sodom); that
Egypt, although most depraved and superstitious, and, worse still, the
harasser of its guest-population, <span
id="fr_2868"></span>[2869](#fn_2868.md) was unjustly stricken with the
chastisement of its ten plagues. *God* hardens the heart of Pharaoh. He
deserved, however, to be influenced <span
id="fr_2869"></span>[2870](#fn_2869.md) to his destruction, who had already
denied God, already in his pride so often rejected His ambassadors,
accumulated heavy burdens on His people, and (to sum up all) as an
Egyptian, had long been guilty before God of Gentile idolatry,
worshipping the ibis and the crocodile in preference to the living God.
Even His own people did God visit in their ingratitude. <span
id="fr_2870"></span>[2871](#fn_2870.md) Against young lads, too, <span
id="page_309">p. 309</span> <span id="v.iv.iii.xiv-Page_309"></span>did
He send forth bears, for their irreverence to the prophet. <span
id="fr_2871"></span>[2872](#fn_2871.md)
