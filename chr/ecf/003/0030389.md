<span id="v.iv.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The Title Christ Suitable as a
Name of the Creator’s Son, But Unsuited to Marcion’s Christ.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xv-p2"></span>Touching then the discussion of His
flesh, and (through that) of His nativity, and incidentally <span
id="fr_3300"></span>[3301](#fn_3300) of His name Emmanuel, let this
suffice.  Concerning His other names, however, and especially that of
Christ, what has the other side to say in reply? If the name of Christ
is as common with you as is the name of God—so that as the Son of both
Gods may be fitly called Christ, so each of the Fathers may be called
Lord—reason will certainly be opposed to this argument. For the name of
God, as being the natural designation of Deity, may be ascribed to all
those beings for whom a divine nature is claimed,—as, for instance, even
to idols. The apostle says: “For there be that are called gods, whether
in heaven or in earth.” <span id="fr_3301"></span>[3302](#fn_3301) The
name of Christ, however, does not arise from nature, but from
dispensation; <span id="fr_3302"></span>[3303](#fn_3302) and so becomes
the proper name of Him to whom it accrues in consequence of the
dispensation. Nor is it subject to be shared in by any other God,
especially a rival, and one that has a dispensation of His own, to whom
it will be also necessary that He should possess names apart from all
others. For how happens it that, after they have de<span
id="page_334">p. 334</span> <span id="v.iv.iv.xv-Page_334"></span>vised
different dispensations for two Gods they admit into this diversity of
dispensation a *community* of names; whereas no proof could be more
useful of two Gods being rival ones, than if there should be found
coincident with their (diverse) dispensations a diversity also of names?
For that is not a state of *diverse* qualities, which is not distinctly
indicated <span id="fr_3303"></span>[3304](#fn_3303) in the specific
meanings <span id="fr_3304"></span>[3305](#fn_3304) of their
designations. Whenever these are wanting, there occurs what the Greeks
call the *katachresis* <span id="fr_3305"></span>[3306](#fn_3305) of a
term, by its improper application to what does not belong to it. <span
id="fr_3306"></span>[3307](#fn_3306) In God, however, there ought, I
suppose, to be no defect, no setting up of His dispensations by
*katachrestic* abuse of words. Who is this god, that claims for his son
names from the Creator? I say not names which do not belong to him, but
ancient and well-known names, which even in this view of them would be
unsuitable for a novel and unknown god.  How is it, again, that he tells
us that “a piece of new cloth is not sewed on to an old garment,” or
that “new wine is not trusted to old bottles,” <span
id="fr_3307"></span>[3308](#fn_3307) when he is himself patched and clad
in an old suit <span id="fr_3308"></span>[3309](#fn_3308) of names? How
is it he has rent off the gospel from the law, when he is wholly
invested with the law,—in the name, forsooth, of Christ? What hindered
his calling himself by some other name, seeing that he preached another
(gospel), came from another source, and refused to take on him a real
body, for the very purpose that he might not be supposed to be the
Creator’s Christ? Vain, however, was his unwillingness to seem to be He
whose name he was willing to assume; since, even if he had been truly
corporeal, he would more certainly escape being taken for the Christ of
the Creator, if he had not taken on him His name.  But, as it is, he
rejects the substantial verity of Him whose name he has assumed, even
though he should give a proof of that verity by his name. For Christ
means *anointed*, and to be anointed is certainly an affair <span
id="fr_3309"></span>[3310](#fn_3309) of the body. He who had not a body,
could not by any possibility have been anointed; he who could not by any
possibility have been anointed, could not in any wise have been called
Christ. It is a different thing (quite), if he only assumed the phantom
of a name too. But how, he asks, was he to insinuate himself into being
believed by the Jews, except through a name which was usual and familiar
amongst them? Then ’tis a fickle and tricksty God whom you describe! To
promote any plan by deception, is the resource of either distrust or of
maliciousness. Much more frank and simple was the conduct of the false
prophets against the Creator, when they came in His name as their own
God. <span id="fr_3310"></span>[3311](#fn_3310) But I do not find that
any good came of this proceeding, <span
id="fr_3311"></span>[3312](#fn_3311) since they were more apt to suppose
either that Christ was their own, or rather was some deceiver, than that
He was the Christ of the other god; and this the gospel will show.
