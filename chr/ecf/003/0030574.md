<span id="v.vii.xix"></span>

<span id="v.vii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Christ, as to His Divine Nature,
as the Word of God, Became Flesh, Not by Carnal Conception, Nor by the
Will of the Flesh and of Man, But by the Will of God. Christ’s Divine
Nature, of Its Own Accord, Descended into the Virgin’s Womb.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xix-p2"></span>What, then, is the meaning of this
passage, “Born <span id="fr_7199"></span>[7200](#fn_7199) not of blood,
nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God?” <span
id="fr_7200"></span>[7201](#fn_7200) I shall make more use of this
passage after I have confuted those who have tampered with it.  They
maintain that it was written thus (in the plural) <span
id="fr_7201"></span>[7202](#fn_7201) “*Who were born*, not of blood, nor
of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God,” as if
designating those who were before mentioned as “believing in His name,”
in order to point out the existence of that mysterious seed of the elect
and spiritual which they appropriate to themselves. <span
id="fr_7202"></span>[7203](#fn_7202) But how can this be, when all who
<span id="page_538">p. 538</span> <span
id="v.vii.xix-Page_538"></span>believe in the name of the Lord are, by
reason of the common principle of the human race, born of blood, and of
the will of the flesh, and of man, as indeed is Valentinus himself? The
expression is in the singular number, as referring to the Lord, “He was
born of God.”  And very properly, because Christ is the Word of God, and
with the Word the Spirit of God, and by the Spirit the Power of God, and
whatsoever else appertains to God. As flesh, however, He is not of
blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of man, because it was by the
will of God that the Word was made flesh.  To the flesh, indeed, and not
to the Word, accrues the denial of the nativity which is natural to us
all as men, <span id="fr_7203"></span>[7204](#fn_7203) because it was as
flesh that He had thus to be born, and not as the Word. Now, whilst the
passage actually denies that He was born of the will of the flesh, how
is it that it did not also deny (that He was born) of the substance of
the flesh?  For it did not disavow the substance of the flesh when it
denied His being “born of blood” but only the matter of the seed, which,
as all know, is the warm blood as convected by ebullition <span
id="fr_7204"></span>[7205](#fn_7204) into the *coagulum* of the woman’s
blood. In the cheese, it is from the coagulation that the milky
substance acquires that consistency, <span
id="fr_7205"></span>[7206](#fn_7205) which is condensed by infusing the
rennet. <span id="fr_7206"></span>[7207](#fn_7206) We thus understand
that what is denied is the Lord’s birth after sexual intercourse (as is
suggested by the phrase, “the will of man and of the flesh”), not *His
nativity* from a woman’s womb. Why, too, is it insisted on with such an
accumulation of emphasis that He was not born of blood, nor of the will
of the flesh, nor (of the will) of man, if it were not that His flesh
was such that no man could have any doubt on the point of its being born
from sexual intercourse?  Again, although denying His birth from such
cohabitation, the passage did not deny that He was born of *real* flesh;
it rather affirmed this, by the very fact that it did not deny His birth
in the flesh in the same way that it denied His birth from sexual
intercourse. Pray, tell me, why the Spirit of God <span
id="fr_7207"></span>[7208](#fn_7207) descended into a woman’s womb at
all, if He did not do so for the purpose of partaking of flesh from the
womb. For He could have become *spiritual* flesh <span
id="fr_7208"></span>[7209](#fn_7208) without such a process,—much more
simply, indeed, without the womb than in it. He had no reason for
enclosing Himself within one, if He was to bear forth nothing from it.
Not without reason, however, did He descend into a womb. Therefore He
received (flesh) therefrom; else, if He received nothing therefrom, His
descent into it would have been without a reason, especially if He meant
to become flesh of that sort which was not derived from a womb, that is
to say, a spiritual one. <span id="fr_7209"></span>[7210](#fn_7209)
