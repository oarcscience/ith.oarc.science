<span id="v.iv.vi.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Another Foolish Erasure of
Marcion’s Exposed. Certain Figurative Expressions of the Apostle,
Suggested by the Language of the Old Testament. Collation of Many
Passages of This Epistle, with Precepts and Statements in the
Pentateuch, the Psalms, and the Prophets. All Alike Teach Us the Will
and Purpose of the Creator.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.xviii-p2"></span>As our heretic is so fond of his
pruning-knife, I do not wonder when syllables are expunged by his hand,
seeing that entire pages are usually the matter on which he practises
his effacing process. The apostle declares that to himself, “less than
the least of all saints, was the grace given” of enlightening all men as
to “what was the fellowship of the mystery, which during the ages had
been hid in God, who created all things.” <span
id="fr_6002"></span>[6003](#fn_6002.md) The heretic erased the preposition
*in*, and made the clause run thus: (“what is the fellowship of the
mystery) which hath for ages been hidden from the God who created all
things.” <span id="fr_6003"></span>[6004](#fn_6003.md) The falsification,
however, is flagrantly <span id="fr_6004"></span>[6005](#fn_6004.md)
absurd. For the apostle goes on to infer (from his own statement): “in
order that unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might
become known through the church the manifold wisdom of God.” <span
id="fr_6005"></span>[6006](#fn_6005.md) *Whose* principalities and powers
does he mean?  If the Creator’s, <span id="page_468">p. 468</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xviii-Page_468"></span>how does it come to pass that such a
God as He could have meant His wisdom to be displayed to the
principalities and powers, but not to Himself? For surely no
principalities could possibly have understood anything without their
sovereign Lord. Or if (the apostle) did not mention God in this passage,
on the ground that He (as their chief) is Himself reckoned among these
(principalities), then he would have plainly said that the mystery had
been hidden from the principalities and powers of Him who had created
all things, including Him amongst them. But if he states that it was
hidden from them, he must needs be understood <span
id="fr_6006"></span>[6007](#fn_6006.md) as having meant that it was
manifest to Him.  *From God*, therefore, the mystery was not hidden; but
it was hidden *in God*, the Creator of all things, from His
principalities and powers. For “who hath known the mind of the Lord, or
who hath been His counsellor?” <span
id="fr_6007"></span>[6008](#fn_6007.md) Caught in this trap, the heretic
probably changed the passage, with the view of saying that *his* god
wished to make known to his principalities and powers the fellowship of
his own mystery, of which God, who created all things, had been
ignorant. But what was the use of his obtruding this ignorance of *the
Creator*, who was a stranger to the superior god, <span
id="fr_6008"></span>[6009](#fn_6008.md) and far enough removed from him,
when even his own servants had known nothing about him? To the Creator,
however, the future was well known. Then why was not that also known to
Him, which had to be revealed beneath His heaven, and on His earth? From
this, therefore, there arises a confirmation of what we have already
laid down. For since the Creator was sure to know, some time or other,
that hidden mystery of the superior god, even on the supposition that
the true reading was (as Marcion has it)—“hidden from the God who
created all things”—he ought then to have expressed the conclusion thus:
“in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to Him,
and then to the principalities and powers of God, whosoever He might be,
with whom the Creator was destined to share their knowledge.” So
palpable is the erasure in this passage, when thus read, consistently
with its own true bearing. I, on my part, now wish to engage with you in
a discussion on the allegorical expressions of the apostle. What figures
of speech could the novel god have found in the prophets (fit for
himself)?  “He led captivity captive,” says the apostle. <span
id="fr_6009"></span>[6010](#fn_6009.md) With what arms? In what conflicts?
From the devastation of what country? From the overthrow of what city?
What women, what children, what princes did the Conqueror throw into
chains? For when by David Christ is sung as “girded with His sword upon
His thigh,” <span id="fr_6010"></span>[6011](#fn_6010.md) or by Isaiah as
“taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power of Damascus,” <span
id="fr_6011"></span>[6012](#fn_6011.md) you make Him out to be <span
id="fr_6012"></span>[6013](#fn_6012.md) really and truly a warrior confest
to the eye. <span id="fr_6013"></span>[6014](#fn_6013.md) Learn then now,
that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already
discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may
further learn that *this* also belongs to Him, even because the apostle
derived the mention of the captivity from the same prophets as suggested
to him his precepts likewise: “Putting away lying,” (says he,) “speak
every man truth with his neighbour;” <span
id="fr_6014"></span>[6015](#fn_6014.md) and again, using the very words in
which the Psalm <span id="fr_6015"></span>[6016](#fn_6015.md) expresses his
meaning, (he says,) “Be ye angry, and sin not;” <span
id="fr_6016"></span>[6017](#fn_6016.md) “Let not the sun go down upon your
wrath.” <span id="fr_6017"></span>[6018](#fn_6017.md) “Have no fellowship
with the unfruitful works of darkness;” <span
id="fr_6018"></span>[6019](#fn_6018) for (in the Psalm it is written,.md)
“With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with the perverse thou shalt
be perverse;” <span id="fr_6019"></span>[6020](#fn_6019.md) and, “Thou
shalt put away evil from among you.” <span
id="fr_6020"></span>[6021](#fn_6020.md) Again, “Go ye out from the midst of
them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves, ye that bear the
vessels of the Lord.” <span id="fr_6021"></span>[6022](#fn_6021.md) (The
apostle says further:) “Be not drunk with wine, wherein is
excess,” <span id="fr_6022"></span>[6023](#fn_6022.md) —a precept which is
suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where the seducers of the
consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: “Ye gave wine to my
holy ones to drink.” <span id="fr_6023"></span>[6024](#fn_6023.md) This
prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest Aaron and his
sons, “when they went into the holy place.” <span
id="fr_6024"></span>[6025](#fn_6024.md) The command, to “sing to the Lord
with psalms and hymns,” <span id="fr_6025"></span>[6026](#fn_6025.md) comes
suitably from him who knew that those who “drank wine with drums and
psalteries” were blamed by God. <span
id="fr_6026"></span>[6027](#fn_6026.md) Now, when I find to what God belong
these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no
difficulty in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs.  But he declares
that “wives ought to be in subjection to their <span id="page_469">p.
469</span> <span id="v.iv.vi.xviii-Page_469"></span>husbands:” <span
id="fr_6027"></span>[6028](#fn_6027.md) what reason does he give for this?
“Because,” says he, “the husband is the head of the wife.” <span
id="fr_6028"></span>[6029](#fn_6028.md) Pray tell me, Marcion, does your
god build up the authority of his law on the work of the Creator? This,
however, is a comparative trifle; for he actually derives from the same
source the condition of his Christ and his Church; for he says: “even as
Christ is the head of the Church;” <span
id="fr_6029"></span>[6030](#fn_6029.md) and again, in like manner: “He who
loveth his wife, loveth his own flesh, even as Christ loved the
Church.” <span id="fr_6030"></span>[6031](#fn_6030.md) You see how your
Christ and your Church are put in comparison with the work of the
Creator.  How much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the
church! “No man,” says the apostle, “ever yet hated his own flesh”
(except, of course, Marcion alone), “but nourisheth and cherisheth it,
even as the Lord doth the Church.” <span
id="fr_6031"></span>[6032](#fn_6031.md) But you are the only man that hates
his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection.  It will be only right
that you should hate the Church also, because it is loved by Christ on
the same principle. <span id="fr_6032"></span>[6033](#fn_6032.md) Yea,
Christ loved the flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the
picture of his wife without taking care of it, and honouring it and
crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged
honour. I shall now endeavour, from my point of view, <span
id="fr_6033"></span>[6034](#fn_6033.md) to prove that the same God is (the
God) of the man <span id="fr_6034"></span>[6035](#fn_6034.md) and of
Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and the spirit, by
the apostle’s help who applies the Creator’s injunction, and adds even a
comment on it: “For this cause shall a man leave his father and his
mother, (and shall be joined unto his wife), and they two shall be one
flesh. This is a great mystery.” <span
id="fr_6035"></span>[6036](#fn_6035.md) In passing, <span
id="fr_6036"></span>[6037](#fn_6036) (I would say that.md) it is enough for
me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries <span
id="fr_6037"></span>[6038](#fn_6037.md) in the estimation of the apostle,
although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. “But I am
speaking,” says he, “of Christ and the Church.” <span
id="fr_6038"></span>[6039](#fn_6038.md) This he says in explanation of the
mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was
prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is
Marcion’s opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures
to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The
superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior;
he was bound rather to annihilate Him. “Children should obey their
parents.” <span id="fr_6039"></span>[6040](#fn_6039.md) Now, although
Marcion has erased (the next clause), “which is the first commandment
with promise,” <span id="fr_6040"></span>[6041](#fn_6040.md) still the law
says plainly, “Honour thy father and thy mother.” <span
id="fr_6041"></span>[6042](#fn_6041) Again, (the apostle writes:.md)
“Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_6042"></span>[6043](#fn_6042.md) For you have heard how
it was said to them of old time: “Ye shall relate these things to your
children; and your children in like manner to their children.” <span
id="fr_6043"></span>[6044](#fn_6043.md) Of what use are two gods to me,
when the discipline is but one? If there must be two, I mean to follow
Him who was the first to teach the lesson. But as our struggle lies
against “the rulers of this world,” <span
id="fr_6044"></span>[6045](#fn_6044.md) what a host of Creator Gods there
must be! <span id="fr_6045"></span>[6046](#fn_6045.md) For why should I not
insist upon this point here, that he ought to have mentioned but *one*
“ruler of this world,” if he meant only the Creator to be the being to
whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when
in the preceding verse he bids us “put on the whole armour of God, that
we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,” <span
id="fr_6046"></span>[6047](#fn_6046.md) does he not show that all the
things which he mentions after the devil’s name really belong to the
devil—“the principalities and the powers, and the rulers of the darkness
of this world,” <span id="fr_6047"></span>[6048](#fn_6047.md) which we also
ascribe to the devil’s authority?  Else, if “the devil” means the
Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator’s dispensation? <span
id="fr_6048"></span>[6049](#fn_6048.md) As there are two gods, must there
also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world?
But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the
devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of
them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also
devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by
what perversion <span id="fr_6049"></span>[6050](#fn_6049.md) the word
*devil* is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some
purpose of the superior god—conduct such as He experienced Himself from
the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose.  For He did not forbid
(our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree, <span
id="fr_6050"></span>[6051](#fn_6050.md) from any apprehension that they
would become gods; <span id="page_470">p. 470</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xviii-Page_470"></span>His prohibition was meant to prevent
their dying after the transgression.  But “the spiritual
wickedness” <span id="fr_6051"></span>[6052](#fn_6051.md) did not signify
the Creator, because of the apostle’s additional description, “in
heavenly places;” <span id="fr_6052"></span>[6053](#fn_6052.md) for the
apostle was quite aware that “spiritual wickedness” had been at work in
heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of
men. <span id="fr_6053"></span>[6054](#fn_6053.md) But how happened it that
(the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what
obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging <span
id="fr_6054"></span>[6055](#fn_6054.md) the Creator, when he displayed to
the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in “making known the
mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,” owing to
his liberty in preaching—and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray
to God that this “open-mouthed utterance” might be continued to
him? <span id="fr_6055"></span>[6056](#fn_6055.md)

<span id="v.iv.vi.xviii-p4"></span> The passage of St. Paul, as
Tertullian expresses it, “Quæ dispensatio sacramenti occulti ab ævis in

part runs, “*Occulti ab ævis Deo, qui omnia condidit*.” The original is,
