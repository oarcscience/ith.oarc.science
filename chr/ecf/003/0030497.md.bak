<span id="v.v.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—A Curious Inconsistency in
Hermogenes Exposed.  Certain</span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxviii-p1.2"></span>Expressions in The History of Creation
Vindicated in The True Sense.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxviii-p2"></span>But we shall show not only that this
condition <span id="fr_6391"></span>[6392](#fn_6391.md) agreed with this
earth of ours, but that <span id="page_493">p. 493</span> <span
id="v.v.xxviii-Page_493"></span>it did not agree with that other
(insisted on by Hermogenes). For, inasmuch as pure Matter was thus
subsistent with God, <span id="fr_6392"></span>[6393](#fn_6392.md) without
the interposition indeed of any element at all (because as yet there
existed nothing but itself and God), it could not of course have been
invisible. Because, although *Hermogenes* contends that darkness was
inherent in the substance of Matter, a position which we shall have to
meet in its proper place, <span id="fr_6393"></span>[6394](#fn_6393.md) yet
darkness is visible even to a human being (for the very fact that there
is the darkness is an evident one), much more is it so to God. If indeed
it <span id="fr_6394"></span>[6395](#fn_6394.md) had been invisible, its
quality would not have been by any means discoverable. How, then, did
Hermogenes find out <span id="fr_6395"></span>[6396](#fn_6395.md) that that
substance was “without form,” and confused and disordered, which, as
being invisible, was not palpable to his senses? If this mystery was
revealed to him by God, he ought to give us his proof. I want to know
also, whether (the substance in question) could have been described as
“void.” That certainly is “void” which is imperfect. Equally certain is
it, that nothing can be imperfect but that which is made; it is
imperfect when it is not fully made. <span
id="fr_6396"></span>[6397](#fn_6396.md) Certainly, you admit. Matter,
therefore, which was not made at all, could not have been imperfect; and
what was not imperfect was not “void.” Having no beginning, because it
was not made, it was also unsusceptible of any void-condition. <span
id="fr_6397"></span>[6398](#fn_6397.md) For this void-condition is an
accident of beginning. The earth, on the contrary, which was made, was
deservedly called “void.”  For as soon as it was made, it had the
condition of being imperfect, previous to its completion.

“rudis” (unformed) for the scriptural term (“void”); of this word
“rudimentum” is the abstract.
