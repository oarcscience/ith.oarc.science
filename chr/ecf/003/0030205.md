<span id="iv.xi.i-p6"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.i-p6.1"></span>Chapter I.—It is Not to the Philosophers that
We Resort for Information About the Soul But to God. <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md) </span>

<span id="iv.xi.i-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.xi.i-p8.1"></span>Having</span> discussed with Hermogenes the
single point of the origin of the soul, so far as his assumption led me,
that the soul consisted rather in an adaptation <span
id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) of matter than of the
inspiration <span id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) of God, I now
turn to the other questions incidental to the subject; and (in my
treatment of these) I shall evidently have mostly to contend with the
philosophers. In the very prison of Socrates they skirmished about the
state of the soul. I have my doubts at once whether the time was an
opportune one for their (great) master—(to say nothing of the place),
although *that* perhaps does not much matter. For what could the soul of
Socrates then contemplate with clearness and serenity? The sacred ship
had returned (from Delos), the hemlock draft to which he had been
condemned had been drunk, death was now present before him: (his mind)
was, <span id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) as one may
suppose, <span id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) naturally
excited <span id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) at every emotion; or
if nature had lost her influence, it must have been deprived of all
power of thought. <span id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md) Or let it
have been as placid and tranquil so you please, inflexible, in spite of
the claims of natural duty, <span id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md)
at the tears of her who was so soon to be his widow, and at the sight of
his thenceforward orphan children, yet his soul must have been moved
even by its very efforts to suppress emotion; and his constancy itself
must have been shaken, as he struggled against the disturbance of the
excitement around him. Besides, what other thoughts could any man
entertain who had been unjustly condemned to die, but such as should
solace him for the injury done to him?  Especially would this be the
case with that glorious creature, the philosopher, to whom injurious
treatment would not suggest a craving for consolation, but rather the
feeling of resentment and indignation. Accordingly, after his sentence,
when his wife came to him with her effeminate cry, O Socrates, you are
unjustly condemned! he seemed already to find joy in answering, Would
you then wish me justly condemned? It is therefore not to be wondered
at, if even in his prison, from a desire to break the foul hands of
Anytus and Melitus, he, in the face of death itself, asserts the
immortality of the soul by a strong assumption such as was wanted to
frustrate the wrong (they had inflicted upon him). So that all the
wisdom of Socrates, at that moment, proceeded from the affectation of an
assumed composure, rather than the firm conviction of ascertained truth.
For by whom has truth ever been discovered without God? By whom has God
ever been found without Christ? By whom has Christ ever been explored
without the Holy Spirit?  By whom has the Holy Spirit ever been attained
without the mysterious gift of faith? <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md) Socrates, as none can doubt, was
actuated by a different spirit. For they say that a demon clave to <span
id="page_182">p. 182</span> <span id="iv.xi.i-Page_182"></span>him from
his boyhood—the very worst teacher certainly, notwithstanding the high
place assigned to it by poets and philosophers—even next to, (nay, along
with) the gods themselves. The teachings of the power of Christ had not
yet been given—(that power) which alone can confute this most pernicious
influence of evil that has nothing good in it, but is rather the author
of all error, and the seducer from all truth. Now if Socrates was
pronounced the wisest of men by the oracle of the Pythian demon, which,
you may be sure, neatly managed the business for his friend, of how much
greater dignity and constancy is the assertion of the Christian wisdom,
before the very breath of which the whole host of demons is scattered! 
This wisdom of the school of heaven frankly and without reserve denies
the gods of this world, and shows no such inconsistency as to order a
“cock to be sacrificed to Æsculapius:” <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md) no new gods and demons does it
introduce, but expels the old ones; it corrupts not youth, but instructs
them in all goodness and moderation; and so it bears the unjust
condemnation not of one city only, but of all the world, in the cause of
that truth which incurs indeed the greater hatred in proportion to its
fulness:  so that it tastes death not out of a (poisoned) cup almost in
the way of jollity; but it exhausts it in every kind of bitter cruelty,
on gibbets and in holocausts. <span id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md)
Meanwhile, in the still gloomier prison of the world amongst your
Cebeses and Phædos, in every investigation concerning (man’s) soul, it
directs its inquiry according to the rules of God. At all events, you
can show us no more powerful expounder of the soul than the Author
thereof. From God you may learn about that which you hold of God; but
from none else will you get this knowledge, if you get it not from God.
For who is to reveal that which God has hidden? To that quarter must we
resort in our inquiries whence we are most safe even in deriving our
ignorance. For it is really better for us not to know a thing, because
He has not revealed it to us, than to know it according to man’s wisdom,
because *he* has been bold enough to assume it.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p3"></span> \[It is not safe to date this treatise
before <span class="sc"><span id="iv.xi.i-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 203,

translator, which follows, relieves me from any necessity to add more,
just here.\]

id="iv.xi.i-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iv.xi.i-p7"></span> In this treatise we have Tertullian’s
speculations on the origin, the nature, and the destiny of the human
soul. There are, no doubt, paradoxes startling to a modern reader to be
found in it, such as that of the soul’s corporeity; and there are weak
and inconclusive arguments. But after all such drawbacks (and they are
not more than what constantly occur in the most renowned speculative
writers of antiquity), the reader will discover many interesting proofs
of our author’s character for originality of thought, width of
information, firm grasp of his subject, and vivacious treatment of it,
such as we have discovered in other parts of his writings. If his
subject permits Tertullian less than usual of an appeal to his favourite
Holy Scripture, he still makes room for occasional illustration from it,
and with his characteristic ability; if, however, there is less of his
sacred learning in it, the treatise teems with curious information drawn
from the secular literature of that early age. Our author often measures
swords with Plato in his discussions on the soul, and it is not too much
to say that he shows himself a formidable opponent to the great
philosopher. See Bp. Kaye, *On Tertullian*, pp. 199, 200.
