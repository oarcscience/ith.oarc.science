<span id="v.ix.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Early Manifestations of the Son
of God, as Recorded in the Old Testament; Rehearsals of His Subsequent
Incarnation.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xvi-p2"></span>But you must not suppose that only the
works which relate to the (creation of the) world were made by the Son,
but also whatsoever since that time has been done by God. For “the
Father who loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His
hand,” <span id="fr_7960"></span>[7961](#fn_7960) loves Him indeed from
the beginning, and from the very first has handed all things over to
Him. Whence it is written, “From the beginning the Word was with God,
and the Word was God;” <span id="fr_7961"></span>[7962](#fn_7961) to
whom “is given by the Father all power in heaven and on earth.” <span
id="fr_7962"></span>[7963](#fn_7962) “The Father judgeth no man, but
hath committed all judgment to the Son” <span
id="fr_7963"></span>[7964](#fn_7963) —from the very beginning even. For
when He speaks of all power and all judgment, and says that all things
were made by Him, and all things have been delivered into His hand, He
allows no exception (in respect) of time, because they would not be *all
things* unless they were *the things of all time*. It is the Son,
therefore, who has been from the beginning administering judgment,
throwing down the haughty tower, and dividing the tongues, punishing the
whole world by the violence of waters, raining upon Sodom and Gomorrah
fire and brimstone, as the <span class="sc"><span
id="v.ix.xvi-p6.2"></span>Lord</span> from the <span class="sc"><span
id="v.ix.xvi-p6.3"></span>Lord</span>.  For <span id="page_612">p.
612</span> <span id="v.ix.xvi-Page_612"></span>He it was who at all
times came down to hold converse with men, from Adam on to the
patriarchs and the prophets, in vision, in dream, in mirror, in dark
saying; ever from the beginning laying the foundation of the course *of
His dispensations*, which He meant to follow out to the very last. Thus
was He ever learning even as God to converse with men upon earth, being
no other than the Word which was to be made flesh. But He was thus
learning (or rehearsing), in order to level for us the way of faith,
that we might the more readily believe that the Son of God had come down
into the world, if we knew that in times past also something similar had
been done. <span id="fr_7964"></span>[7965](#fn_7964) For as it was on
our account *and for our learning* that these events are described in
the Scriptures, so for our sakes also were they done—(even *ours*, I
say), “upon whom the ends of the world are come.” <span
id="fr_7965"></span>[7966](#fn_7965) In this way it was that even then
He knew full well what human feelings and affections were, intending as
He always did to take upon Him man’s actual component substances, body
and soul, making inquiry of Adam (as if He were ignorant), <span
id="fr_7966"></span>[7967](#fn_7966) “Where art thou, Adam?” <span
id="fr_7967"></span>[7968](#fn_7967) —repenting that He had made man, as
if He had lacked foresight; <span id="fr_7968"></span>[7969](#fn_7968)
tempting Abraham, as if ignorant of what was in man; offended with
persons, and then reconciled to them; and whatever other (weaknesses and
imperfections) the heretics lay hold of (in their assumptions) as
unworthy of God, in order to discredit the Creator, not considering that
these *circumstances* are suitable enough for the Son, who was one day
to experience even human sufferings—hunger and thirst, and tears, and
actual birth and real death, and in respect of such a dispensation “made
by the Father a little less than the angels.” <span
id="fr_7969"></span>[7970](#fn_7969) But the heretics, you may be sure,
will not allow that those things are suitable even to the Son of God,
which you are imputing to the very Father Himself, when you
pretend <span id="fr_7970"></span>[7971](#fn_7970) that He made Himself
less (than the angels) on our account; whereas the Scripture informs us
that He who was made less was so affected by another, and not Himself by
Himself. What, again, if He was *One* who was “crowned with glory and
honour,” and He *Another* by whom He was so crowned, <span
id="fr_7971"></span>[7972](#fn_7971) —the Son, in fact, by the Father?
Moreover, how comes it to pass, that the Almighty Invisible God, “whom
no man hath seen nor can see; He who dwelleth in light
unapproachable;” <span id="fr_7972"></span>[7973](#fn_7972) “He who
dwelleth not in *temples* made with hands;” <span
id="fr_7973"></span>[7974](#fn_7973) “from before whose sight the earth
trembles, and the mountains melt like wax;” <span
id="fr_7974"></span>[7975](#fn_7974) who holdeth the whole world in His
hand “like a nest;” <span id="fr_7975"></span>[7976](#fn_7975) “whose
throne is heaven, and earth His footstool;” <span
id="fr_7976"></span>[7977](#fn_7976) in whom is every place, but Himself
is in no place; who is the utmost bound of the universe;—how happens it,
I say, that He (who, though) the Most High, should yet have walked in
paradise towards the *cool of the* evening, in quest of Adam; and should
have shut up the ark after Noah had entered it; and at Abraham’s tent
should have refreshed Himself under an oak; and have called to Moses out
of the burning bush; and have appeared as “the fourth” in the furnace of
the Babylonian monarch (although He is there called the Son of
man),—unless all these events had happened as an image, as a mirror, as
an enigma (of the future incarnation)? Surely even these things could
not have been believed even of the Son of God, unless they had been
given us in the Scriptures; possibly also they could not have been
believed of the Father, even if they had been given in the Scriptures,
since these men bring *Him* down into Mary’s womb, and set Him before
Pilate’s judgment-seat, and bury Him in the sepulchre of Joseph. Hence,
therefore, their error becomes manifest; for, being ignorant that the
entire order of the divine administration has from the very first had
its course through the agency of the Son, they believe that the Father
Himself was actually seen, and held converse with men, and worked, and
was athirst, and suffered hunger (in spite of the prophet who says: “The
everlasting God, *the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth*, shall
never thirst at all, nor be hungry;” <span
id="fr_7977"></span>[7978](#fn_7977) much more, shall neither die at any
time, nor be buried!), and therefore that it was uniformly one God, even
the Father, who at all times did Himself the things which were really
done *by Him* through the agency of the Son.
