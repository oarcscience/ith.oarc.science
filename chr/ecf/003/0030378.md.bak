<span id="v.iv.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Marcion’s Christ Not the Subject
of Prophecy. The Absurd Consequences of This Theory of the
Heretic.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.iv-p2"></span>He <span
id="fr_3126"></span>[3127](#fn_3126.md) disdained, I suppose, to imitate
the order of our God, as one who was displeasing to him, and was by all
means to be vanquished. He wished to come, as a new being in a new way—a
son previous to his father’s announcement, a sent one before the
authority of the sender; so that he might in person <span
id="fr_3127"></span>[3128](#fn_3127.md) propagate a most monstrous faith,
whereby it should come to be believed that Christ was come before it
should be known that He had an existence. It is here convenient to me to
treat that other point: Why he came not after Christ? For when I observe
that, during so long a period, his lord <span
id="fr_3128"></span>[3129](#fn_3128.md) bore with the greatest patience the
very ruthless Creator who was all the while announcing His Christ to
men, I say, that whatever reason impelled him to do so, postponing
thereby his own revelation and interposition, the self-same reason
imposed on him the duty of bearing with the Creator (who had also in
*His* Christ dispensations of His own to carry out); so that, after the
completion and accomplishment of the entire plan of the rival God and
the rival Christ, <span id="fr_3129"></span>[3130](#fn_3129.md) he might
then superinduce his own proper dispensation. But he grew weary of so
long an endurance, and so failed to wait till the end of the Creator’s
course. It was of no use, his enduring that his Christ should be
predicted, when he refused to permit him to be manifested. <span
id="fr_3130"></span>[3131](#fn_3130.md) Either it was without just cause
that he interrupted the full course of his rival’s time, or without just
cause did he so long refrain from interrupting it.  What held him back
*at first*? Or what disturbed him *at last*? As the case now stands,
however, <span id="fr_3131"></span>[3132](#fn_3131.md) he has committed
himself in respect of both, having revealed himself so tardily after the
Creator, so hurriedly before His Christ; whereas he ought long ago to
have encountered the one with a confutation, the other to have forborne
encountering as yet—not to have borne with the one so long in His
ruthless hostility, nor to have disquieted the other, who was as yet
quiescent! In the case of both, while depriving them of their title to
be considered the most good God, he showed himself at least capricious
and uncertain; lukewarm (in his resentment) towards the Creator, but
fervid against His Christ, and powerless <span
id="fr_3132"></span>[3133](#fn_3132.md) in respect of them both! For he no
more restrained the Creator than he resisted His Christ. The Creator
still remains such as He really is. His Christ also will come, <span
id="fr_3133"></span>[3134](#fn_3133.md) just as it is written of Him. Why
did he <span id="fr_3134"></span>[3135](#fn_3134.md) come after the
Creator, since he was unable to correct Him by punishment? <span
id="fr_3135"></span>[3136](#fn_3135.md) Why did he reveal himself before
Christ, whom he could not hinder from appearing? <span
id="fr_3136"></span>[3137](#fn_3136.md) If, on the contrary, <span
id="fr_3137"></span>[3138](#fn_3137.md) he did chastise the Creator, he
revealed himself, (I suppose,) after Him in order that things which
require correction might come first. On which account also, (of course,)
he ought to have waited for Christ to appear first, whom he was going to
chastise in like manner; then he would be His punisher coming after
Him, <span id="fr_3138"></span>[3139](#fn_3138.md) just as he had been in
the case of the Creator.  There is another consideration:  since he will
at his second advent come after Him, that as he at His first coming took
hostile proceedings against the Creator, destroying the law and the
prophets, which were His, so he may, to be sure, <span
id="fr_3139"></span>[3140](#fn_3139.md) at his second coming proceed in
opposition to Christ, upsetting <span
id="fr_3140"></span>[3141](#fn_3140.md) His kingdom. Then, no doubt, he
would terminate his <span id="page_324">p. 324</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.iv-Page_324"></span>course, and then (if ever) <span
id="fr_3141"></span>[3142](#fn_3141.md) be worthy of belief; for else, if
his work has been already perfected, it would be in vain for him to
come, for there would indeed be nothing that he could further
accomplish.

<span id="v.iv.iv.iv-p7"></span> He twits Marcion with introducing his
Christ on the scene *too soon*. He ought to have waited until the
*Creator’s* Christ (prophesied of through the Old Testament) had come.
Why allow him to be predicted, and then forbid His actual coming, by his
own arrival on the scene first? Of course, M. must be understood to deny
that the Christ of the New Testament is the subject of the Old Testament
prophecies at all.  Hence T.’s anxiety to adduce *prophecy* as the main
evidence of our Lord as being really the Creator’s Christ.

Tertullian is here arguing on Marcion’s ground, according to whom the
Creator’s Christ, the Christ predicted through the O.T., was yet to
come. Marcion’s Christ, however, had proved himself so weak to stem the
Creator’s course, that he had no means really of checking the Creator’s
Christ from coming. It had been better, adds Tertullian, if Marcion’s
Christ had waited for the Creator’s Christ to have first appeared.
