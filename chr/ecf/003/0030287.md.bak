<span id="v.iii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—All Doctrine True Which Comes
Through the Church from the Apostles, Who Were Taught by God Through
Christ. All Opinion Which Has No Such Divine Origin and Apostolic
Tradition to Show, is</span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxi-p1.2"></span>Ipso Facto</span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxi-p1.3"></span>False.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxi-p2"></span>From this, therefore, do we draw up our
rule. Since the Lord Jesus Christ sent the apostles to preach, (our rule
is) that no others ought to be received as preachers than those whom
Christ appointed; for “no man knoweth the Father save the Son, and he to
whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.” <span
id="fr_2061"></span>[2062](#fn_2061.md) Nor does the Son seem to have
revealed Him to any other than the apostles, whom He sent forth to
preach—that, of course, which He revealed to them. Now, what that was
which they preached—in other words, what it was which Christ revealed to
them—can, as I must here likewise prescribe, properly be proved in no
other way than by those very churches which the apostles founded in
person, by declaring the gospel to them directly themselves, both *vivâ
voce*, as the phrase is, and subsequently by their epistles. If, then,
these things are so, it is in the same degree <span
id="fr_2062"></span>[2063](#fn_2062.md) manifest that all doctrine which
agrees with the apostolic churches—those moulds <span
id="fr_2063"></span>[2064](#fn_2063.md) and original sources of the faith
must be reckoned for truth, as undoubtedly containing that which the
(said) churches received from the apostles, the apostles from Christ,
Christ from God.  Whereas all doctrine must be prejudged <span
id="fr_2064"></span>[2065](#fn_2064.md) as false <span
id="fr_2065"></span>[2066](#fn_2065.md) which savours of contrariety to the
truth of the churches and apostles of Christ and God. It remains, then,
that we demonstrate whether this doctrine of ours, of which we have now
given the rule, has its origin <span
id="fr_2066"></span>[2067](#fn_2066.md) in the tradition of the apostles,
and whether all other *doctrines* do not *ipso facto* <span
id="fr_2067"></span>[2068](#fn_2067.md) proceed from falsehood. We hold
communion with the apostolic churches because our doctrine is in no
respect <span id="page_253">p. 253</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxi-Page_253"></span>different *from theirs*. This is *our*
witness of truth.
