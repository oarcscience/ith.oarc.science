<span id="iv.ix.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.ix.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Of Circumcision and the
Supercession of the Old Law.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p2"></span>But Abraham, (you say,) was circumcised.
Yes, but he pleased God before his circumcision; <span
id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161) nor yet did he observe the Sabbath.
For he had “accepted” <span id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162)
circumcision; but such as was to be for “a sign” of that time, not for a
prerogative title to salvation. In fact, subsequent patriarchs were
uncircumcised, like Melchizedek, who, uncircumcised, offered to Abraham
himself, already circumcised, on his return from battle, bread and
wine. <span id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163) “But again,” (you say)
“the son of Moses would upon one occasion have been choked by an angel,
if Zipporah, <span id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164) had not
circumcised the foreskin of the infant with a pebble; whence, “there is
the greatest peril if any fail to circumcise the foreskin of his flesh.”
Nay, but if circumcision altogether brought salvation, even Moses
himself, in the case of his own son, would not have omitted to
circumcise him on the eighth day; whereas it is agreed that Zipporah did
it on the journey, at the compulsion of the angel. Consider we,
accordingly, that one single infant’s compulsory circumcision cannot
have prescribed to every people, and founded, as it were, a law for
keeping this precept. For God, foreseeing that He was about to give this
circumcision to the people of Israel for “a sign,” not for salvation,
urges the circumcision of the son of Moses, their future leader, for
this reason; that, since He had begun, through him, to give the People
the precept of cir<span id="page_154">p. 154</span> <span
id="iv.ix.iii-Page_154"></span>cumcision, the people should not despise
it, from seeing this example (of neglect) already exhibited
conspicuously in their leader’s son. For circumcision had to be given;
but as “a sign,” whence Israel in the last time would have to be
distinguished, when, in accordance with their deserts, they should be
prohibited from entering the holy city, as we see through the words of
the prophets, saying, “Your land is desert; your cities utterly burnt
with fire; your country, in your sight, strangers shall eat up; and,
deserted and subverted by strange peoples, the daughter of Zion shall be
derelict, like a shed in a vineyard, and like a watchhouse in a
cucumber-field, and as it were a city which is being stormed.” <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165) Why so?  Because the subsequent
discourse of the prophet reproaches them, saying, “Sons have I begotten
and upraised, but they have reprobated me;” <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[1167](#fn_1166) and again, “And if ye shall have
outstretched hands, I will avert my face from you; and if ye shall have
multiplied prayers, I will not hear you: for your hands are full of
blood;” <span id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167) and again, “Woe!
sinful nation; a people full of sins; wicked sons; ye have quite
forsaken God, and have provoked unto indignation the Holy One of
Israel.” <span id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168) This, therefore, was
God’s foresight,—that of giving circumcision to Israel, for a sign
whence they might be distinguished when the time should arrive wherein
their above-mentioned deserts should prohibit their admission into
Jerusalem:  which circumstance, because it was to be, used to be
announced; and, because we see it accomplished, is recognised by us.
For, as the carnal circumcision, which was temporary, was in wrought for
“a sign” in a contumacious people, so the spiritual has been given for
salvation to an obedient people; while the prophet Jeremiah says, “Make
a renewal for you, and sow not in thorns; be circumcised to God, and
circumcise the foreskin of your heart:” <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169) and in another place he says,
“Behold, days shall come, saith the Lord, and I will draw up, for the
house of Judah and for the house of Jacob, <span
id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170) a new testament; not such as I once
gave their fathers in the day wherein I led them out from the land of
Egypt.” <span id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171) Whence we understand
that the coming cessation of the former circumcision then given, and the
coming procession of a new law (not such as He had already given to the
fathers), are announced: just as Isaiah foretold, saying that in the
last days the mount of the Lord and the house of God were to be manifest
above the tops of the mounts: “And it shall be exalted,” he says, “above
the hills; and there shall come over it all nations; and many shall
walk, and say, Come, ascend we unto the mount of the Lord, and unto the
house of the God of *Jacob*,” <span id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172)
—not of *Esau*, the former son, but of *Jacob*, the second; that is, of
*our* “people,” whose “mount” is Christ, “præcised without concisors’
hands, <span id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173) filling every land,”
shown in the book of Daniel. <span id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174)
In short, the coming procession of a new law out of this “house of the
God of Jacob” Isaiah in the ensuing words announces, saying, “For from
Zion shall go out a law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem, and
shall judge among the nations,”—that is, among *us*, who have been
called out of the nations,—“and they shall join to beat their glaives
into ploughs, and their lances into sickles; and nations shall not take
up glaive against nation, and they shall no more learn to fight.” <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175) Who else, therefore, are understood
but *we*, who, fully taught by the new law, observe these practices,—the
old law being obliterated, the coming of whose abolition the action
itself <span id="fr_1176"></span>[1177](#fn_1176) demonstrates? For the
wont of the old law was to avenge itself by the vengeance of the glaive,
and to pluck out “eye for eye,” and to inflict retaliatory revenge for
injury. <span id="fr_1177"></span>[1178](#fn_1177) But the new law’s
wont was to point to clemency, and to convert to tranquillity the
pristine ferocity of “glaives” and “lances,” and to remodel the pristine
execution of “war” upon the rivals and foes of the law into the pacific
actions of “ploughing” and “tilling” the land. <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178) Therefore as we have shown above
that the coming cessation of the old law and of the carnal circumcision
was declared, so, too, the observance of the new law and the spiritual
circumcision has shone out into the voluntary obediences <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179) of peace. For “a people,” he says,
“whom I knew not hath served me; in obedience of the ear it hath obeyed
me.” <span id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180) Prophets made the
announcement. But what is the “people” which was ignorant of God, but
*ours*, who in days bygone knew not God? and who, in the <span
id="page_155">p. 155</span> <span id="iv.ix.iii-Page_155"></span>hearing
of the ear, gave heed to Him, but *we*, who, forsaking idols, have been
converted to God? For Israel—who *had* been known to God, and who had by
Him been “upraised” <span id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181) in Egypt,
and was transported through the Red Sea, and who in the desert, fed
forty years with manna, was wrought to the semblance of eternity, and
not contaminated with human passions, <span
id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182) or fed on this world’s <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183) meats, but fed on “angel’s
loaves” <span id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184) —the manna—and
sufficiently bound to God by His benefits—forgot his Lord and God,
saying to Aaron: “Make us gods, to go before us: for that Moses, who
ejected us from the land of Egypt, hath quite forsaken us; and what hath
befallen him we know not.” And accordingly we, who “were not the people
of God” in days bygone, have been made His people, <span
id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185) by accepting the new law above
mentioned, and the new circumcision before foretold.

*carnally* when Melchizedek met him. Comp. [Gen.
