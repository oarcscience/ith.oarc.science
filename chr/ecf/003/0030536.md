<span id="v.vi.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—The Vanity as Well as Ignorance
of the Demiurge. Absurd Results from So Imperfect a Condition.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxi-p2"></span>Meanwhile you must believe <span
id="fr_6823"></span>[6824](#fn_6823) that Sophia has the surnames of
earth and of Mother—“Mother-Earth,” of course—and (what may excite your
laughter still more heartily) even Holy Spirit. In this way they have
conferred all honour on that female, I suppose even a beard, not to say
other things. Besides, <span id="fr_6824"></span>[6825](#fn_6824) the
Demiurge had so little mastery over things, <span
id="fr_6825"></span>[6826](#fn_6825) on the score, <span
id="fr_6826"></span>[6827](#fn_6826) you must know, <span
id="fr_6827"></span>[6828](#fn_6827) of his inability to approach
spiritual essences, (constituted as he was) of animal elements, that,
imagining himself to be the only being, he uttered this soliloquy: “I am
God, and beside me there is none else.” <span
id="fr_6828"></span>[6829](#fn_6828) But for all that, he at least was
aware that he had not himself existed before. He understood, therefore,
that he had been created, and that there must be a creator of a creature
of some sort or other.  How happens it, then, that he seemed to himself
to be the only being, notwithstanding his uncertainty, and although he
had, at any rate, some suspicion of the existence of some creator?
