<span id="v.v.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—An Appeal to the History of
Creation. True Meaning of the Term Beginning, Which the Heretic
Curiously Wrests to an Absurd Sense.</span>

<span id="v.v.xix-p2"></span>But I shall appeal to the original
document <span id="fr_6315"></span>[6316](#fn_6315.md) of Moses, by help of
which they on the other side vainly endeavour to prop up their
conjectures, with the view, of course, of appearing to have the support
of that authority which is indispensable in such an inquiry. They have
found their opportunity, as is usual with heretics, in wresting the
plain meaning of certain words. For instance the very *beginning*, <span
id="fr_6316"></span>[6317](#fn_6316.md) when God made the heaven and the
earth, they will construe as if it meant something substantial and
embodied, <span id="fr_6317"></span>[6318](#fn_6317.md) to be regarded as
Matter. We, however, insist on the proper signification of every word,
*and say* that *principium* means beginning,—being a term which is
suitable to represent things which begin to exist. For nothing which has
come into being is without a beginning, nor can this its commencement be
at any other moment than when it begins to have existence. Thus
*principium* or beginning, is simply a term of inception, not the name
of a substance.  Now, inasmuch as the heaven and the earth are the
principal works of God, and since, by His making them first, He
constituted them in an especial manner the beginning of His creation,
before all things else, with good reason does the Scripture preface (its
record of creation) with the words, “In the beginning God made the
heaven and the earth;” <span id="fr_6318"></span>[6319](#fn_6318.md) just
as it would have said, “At last God made the heaven and the earth,” if
God had created these after all the rest.  Now, if the beginning is a
substance, the end must also be material. No doubt, a substantial
thing <span id="fr_6319"></span>[6320](#fn_6319.md) may be the beginning of
some other thing which may be formed out of it; thus the clay is the
beginning of the vessel, and the seed is the beginning of the plant. But
when we employ the word beginning in this sense of *origin*, and not in
that of *order*, we do not omit to mention also the name of that
particular thing which we regard as the origin of the other. On the
other hand, <span id="fr_6320"></span>[6321](#fn_6320.md) if we were to
make such a statement as this, for example, “In the beginning the potter
made a basin or a water-jug,” the word beginning will not here indicate
a material substance (for I have not mentioned the clay, which is the
beginning *in this sense*, but only the *order* of the work, meaning
that the potter made the basin and the jug first, before anything
else—intending afterwards to make the rest. It is, then, to the order of
the works that the word beginning has reference, not to the origin of
their substances. I might also explain this word *beginning* in another
way, which would not, however, be inapposite. <span
id="fr_6321"></span>[6322](#fn_6321.md) The Greek term for beginning, which
is <span class="Greek"><span id="v.v.xix-p9.1"></span>ἀρχή</span>,
admits the sense not only of priority of order, but of power as well;
whence princes and magistrates are called <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.v.xix-p9.2"></span>ἀρχοντες</span>. Therefore in this sense too,
*beginning* may be taken for princely authority and power. It was,
indeed, in His transcendent authority and power, that God made the
heaven and the earth.
