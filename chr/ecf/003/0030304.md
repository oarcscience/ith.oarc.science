<span id="v.iii.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.—Harmony of the Church
and the Scriptures. Heretics Have Tampered with the Scriptures, and
Mutilated, and Altered Them.  Catholics Never Change the Scriptures,
Which Always Testify for Them.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxxviii-p2"></span>Where diversity of doctrine is found,
*there*, then, must the corruption both of the Scriptures and the
expositions thereof be regarded as existing. On those whose purpose it
was to teach differently, lay the necessity of differently arranging the
instruments of doctrine. <span id="fr_2249"></span>[2250](#fn_2249) They
could not possibly have effected their diversity of teaching in any
other way than by having a difference in the means whereby they taught.
As in their case, corruption in doctrine could not possibly have
succeeded without a corruption also of its instruments, so to ourselves
also integrity of doctrine could not have accrued, without integrity in
those means by which doctrine is managed. Now, what is there in our
Scriptures which is contrary to us? <span
id="fr_2250"></span>[2251](#fn_2250) What of our own have we introduced,
that we should have to take it away again, or else add to it, or alter
it, in order to restore to its natural soundness anything which is
contrary to it, and contained in the Scriptures? <span
id="fr_2251"></span>[2252](#fn_2251) What we are ourselves, that also
the Scriptures are (and have been) from the beginning. <span
id="fr_2252"></span>[2253](#fn_2252) Of <span id="page_262">p.
262</span> <span id="v.iii.xxxviii-Page_262"></span>them we have our
being, before there was any other way, before they were interpolated by
you. Now, inasmuch as all interpolation must be believed to be a later
process, for the express reason that it proceeds from rivalry which is
never in any case previous to nor home-born <span
id="fr_2253"></span>[2254](#fn_2253) with that which it emulates, it is
as incredible to every man of sense that we should seem to have
introduced any corrupt text into the Scriptures, existing, as we have
been, from the very first, and being the first, as it is that they have
not in fact introduced it who are both later in date and opposed (to the
Scriptures). One man perverts the Scriptures with his hand, another
their meaning by his exposition. For although Valentinus seems to use
the entire volume, <span id="fr_2254"></span>[2255](#fn_2254) he has
none the less laid violent hands on the truth only with a more cunning
mind and skill <span id="fr_2255"></span>[2256](#fn_2255) than Marcion.
Marcion expressly and openly used the knife, not the pen, since he made
such an excision of the Scriptures as suited his own
subject-matter. <span id="fr_2256"></span>[2257](#fn_2256) Valentinus,
however, abstained from such excision, because he did not invent
Scriptures to square with his own subject-matter, but adapted his matter
to the Scriptures; and yet he took away more, and added more, by
removing the proper meaning of every particular word, and adding
fantastic arrangements of things which have no real existence. <span
