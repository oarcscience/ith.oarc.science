<span id="v.v.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—These Latter Speculations
Shown to Be Contradictory to the First Principles Respecting Matter,
Formerly Laid Down by Hermogenes.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxxix-p2"></span>Well, now, since it seems to you to be
the correcter thing, <span id="fr_6545"></span>[6546](#fn_6545.md) let
Matter be circumscribed <span id="fr_6546"></span>[6547](#fn_6546.md) by
means of changes and displacements; let it also be capable of
comprehension, since (as you say) it is used as material by God, <span
id="fr_6547"></span>[6548](#fn_6547.md) on the ground of its being
convertible, mutable, and separable. For its changes, you say, show it
to be inseparable. And here you have swerved from your own lines <span
id="fr_6548"></span>[6549](#fn_6548.md) which you prescribed respecting the
person of God when you laid down the rule that God made it not out of
His own self, because it was not possible for Him to become
divided <span id="fr_6549"></span>[6550](#fn_6549.md) seeing that He is
eternal and abiding for ever, and therefore unchangeable and
indivisible. Since Matter too is estimated by the same eternity, having
neither beginning nor end, it will be unsusceptible of division, of
change, for the same reason that God also is. Since it is associated
with Him in the joint possession of eternity, it must needs share with
Him also the powers, the laws, and the conditions of eternity.  In like
manner, when you say, “All things simultaneously throughout the
universe <span id="fr_6550"></span>[6551](#fn_6550.md) possess portions of
it, <span id="fr_6551"></span>[6552](#fn_6551.md) that so the whole may be
ascertained from <span id="fr_6552"></span>[6553](#fn_6552.md) its parts,”
you of course mean to indicate those parts which were produced out of
it, and which are now visible to us.  How then is this possession (of
Matter) by all things throughout the universe effected—that is, of
course, from the very beginning <span
id="fr_6553"></span>[6554](#fn_6553.md) —when the things which are now
visible to us are different in their condition <span
id="fr_6554"></span>[6555](#fn_6554.md) from what they were in the
beginning?
