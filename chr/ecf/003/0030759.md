<span id="vi.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Of Putting Off Cloaks.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv-p2"></span>But since we have touched on one special
point of empty observance, <span id="fr_8850"></span>[8851](#fn_8850.md) it
will not be irksome to set our brand likewise on the other points
against which the reproach of vanity may deservedly be laid; if, that
is, they are observed without the authority of any precept <span
id="page_686">p. 686</span> <span id="vi.iv.xv-Page_686"></span>either
of the Lord, or else of the apostles. For matters of this kind belong
not to religion, but to superstition, being studied, and forced, and of
curious rather than rational ceremony; <span
id="fr_8851"></span>[8852](#fn_8851.md) deserving of restraint, at all
events, even on this ground, that they put us on a level with
Gentiles. <span id="fr_8852"></span>[8853](#fn_8852.md) As, *e.g.*, it is
the custom of some to make prayer with cloaks doffed, for so do the
nations approach their idols; which practice, of course, were its
observance becoming, the apostles, who teach concerning the garb of
prayer, <span id="fr_8853"></span>[8854](#fn_8853.md) would have
comprehended *in their instructions*, unless any think that is was in
prayer that Paul had left his cloak with Carpus! <span
id="fr_8854"></span>[8855](#fn_8854.md) God, forsooth, would not hear
cloaked suppliants, who plainly heard the three saints in the Babylonian
king’s furnace praying in their trousers and turbans. <span
