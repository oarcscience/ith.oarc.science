<span id="v.viii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—God’s Love for the Flesh of Man,
as Developed in the Grace of Christ Towards It. The Flesh the Best Means
of Displaying the Bounty and Power of God.</span>

<span id="v.viii.ix-p2"></span>To recapitulate, then: Shall that very
flesh, which the Divine Creator formed with His own hands in the image
of God; which He animated with His own *afflatus*, after the likeness of
His own vital vigour; which He set over all the works of His hand, to
dwell amongst, to enjoy, and to rule them; which He clothed with His
sacraments and His instructions; whose purity He loves, whose mor<span
id="page_552">p. 552</span> <span
id="v.viii.ix-Page_552"></span>tifications He approves; whose sufferings
for Himself He deems precious;—(shall that flesh, I say), so often
brought near to God, not rise again?  God forbid, God forbid, (I
repeat), that He should abandon to everlasting destruction the labour of
His own hands, the care of His own thoughts, the receptacle of His own
Spirit, <span id="fr_7342"></span>[7343](#fn_7342.md) the queen of His
creation, the inheritor of His own liberality, the priestess of His
religion, the champion of His testimony, the sister of His Christ! We
know by experience the goodness of God; from His Christ we learn that He
is the only God, and the very good. Now, as He requires from us love to
our neighbour after love to Himself, <span
id="fr_7343"></span>[7344](#fn_7343.md) so He will Himself do that which He
has commanded. He will love the flesh which is, so very closely and in
so many ways, His neighbour—(He will love it), although infirm, since
His strength is made perfect in weakness; <span
id="fr_7344"></span>[7345](#fn_7344.md) although disordered, since “they
that are whole need not the physician, but they that are sick;” <span
id="fr_7345"></span>[7346](#fn_7345.md) although not honourable, since “we
bestow more abundant honour upon the less honourable members;” <span
id="fr_7346"></span>[7347](#fn_7346.md) although ruined, since He says, “I
am come to save that which was lost;” <span
id="fr_7347"></span>[7348](#fn_7347.md) although sinful, since He says, “I
desire rather the salvation of the sinner than his death;” <span
id="fr_7348"></span>[7349](#fn_7348.md) although condemned, for says He, “I
shall wound, and also heal.” <span id="fr_7349"></span>[7350](#fn_7349.md)
Why reproach the flesh with those conditions which wait for God, which
hope in God, which receive honour from God, which He succours? I venture
to declare, that if such casualties as these had never befallen the
flesh, the bounty, the grace, the mercy, (and indeed) all the beneficent
power of God, would have had no opportunity to work. <span
