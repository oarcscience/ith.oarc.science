id="vi.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Of the Kiss of Peace.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii-p2"></span>Another custom has now become
prevalent. Such as are fasting withhold the kiss of peace, which is the
seal of prayer, after prayer made with brethren. But when is peace more
to be concluded with brethren than when, at the time of some religious
observance, <span id="fr_8862"></span>[8863](#fn_8862.md) our prayer
ascends with more acceptability; that they may themselves participate in
our observance, and thereby be mollified for transacting with their
brother touching their own peace? What prayer is complete if divorced
from the “holy kiss?” <span id="fr_8863"></span>[8864](#fn_8863.md) Whom
does peace impede when rendering service to his Lord? What kind of
sacrifice is that from which men depart without peace?  Whatever our
prayer be, it will not be better than the observance of the precept by
which we are bidden to conceal our fasts; <span
id="fr_8864"></span>[8865](#fn_8864.md) for *now*, by abstinence from the
kiss, we are known to be fasting. But even if there be some reason *for
this practice*, still, lest you offend against this precept, you may
perhaps defer your “peace” *at home*, where it is not possible for your
fast to be en<span id="page_687">p. 687</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xviii-Page_687"></span>tirely kept secret. But wherever else
you can conceal your observance, you ought to remember the precept: 
thus you may satisfy the requirements of Discipline abroad and of custom
at home. So, too, on the day of the passover, <span
id="fr_8865"></span>[8866](#fn_8865.md) when the religious observance of a
fast is general, and as it were public, we justly forego the kiss,
caring nothing to conceal anything which we do in common with all.
