id="iv.viii.i.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII. <span
id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) —The Charge of Worshipping the Sun Met
by a Retort.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xiii-p3"></span>Others, with greater regard to good
manners, it must be confessed, suppose that the sun is the god of the
Christians, because it is a well-known fact that we pray towards the
east, or because we make Sunday a day of festivity.  What then? Do you
do less than this? Do not many among you, with an affectation of
sometimes worshipping the heavenly bodies likewise, move your lips in
the direction of the sunrise? It is you, at all events, who have even
admitted the sun into the calendar of the week; and you have selected
its day, <span id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md) in preference to the
preceding day <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md) as the most
suitable in the week <span id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md) for either
an entire abstinence from the bath, or for its postponement until the
evening, or for taking rest and for banqueting. By resorting to these
customs, you deliberately deviate from your own religious rites to those
of strangers. For the Jewish feasts on the Sabbath and “the
Purification,” <span id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) and Jewish also
are the ceremonies of the lamps, <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md)
and the fasts of unleavened bread, and the “littoral prayers,” <span
id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) all which institutions and practices
are of course foreign from your gods. Wherefore, that I may return from
this digression, you who reproach us with the sun and Sunday should
consider your proximity to us. We are not far off from your Saturn and
your days of rest.
