<span id="vi.vi.ii-p3"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vi.ii-p3.1"></span>Preface. <span
id="fr_8973"></span>[8974](#fn_8973.md) </span>

<span id="vi.vi.ii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.vi.ii-p5.1"></span>If</span> ancient illustrations of faith which
both testify to God’s grace and tend to man’s edification are collected
in writing, so that by the perusal of them, as if by the reproduction of
the facts, as well God may be honoured, as man may be strengthened; why
should not new instances be also collected, that shall be equally
suitable for both purposes,—if only on the ground that these modern
examples will one day become ancient and available for posterity,
although in their present time they are esteemed of less authority, by
reason of the presumed veneration for antiquity? But let men look to it,
if they judge the power of the Holy Spirit to be one, according to the
times and seasons; since some things of later date must be esteemed of
more account as being nearer to the very last times, in accordance with
the exuberance of grace manifested to the final periods determined for
the world. For “in the last days, saith the Lord, I will pour out of my
Spirit upon all flesh; and their sons and their daughters shall
prophesy. And upon my servants and my handmaidens will I pour out of my
Spirit; and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall
dream dreams.” <span id="fr_8974"></span>[8975](#fn_8974.md) And thus
we—who both acknowledge and reverence, even as we do the prophecies,
modern visions as equally promised to us, and consider the other powers
of the Holy Spirit as an agency of the Church for which also He was
sent, administering all gifts in all, even as the Lord distributed to
every one <span id="fr_8975"></span>[8976](#fn_8975.md) as well needfully
collect them in writing, as commemorate them in reading to God’s glory;
that so no weakness or despondency of faith may suppose that the divine
grace abode only among the ancients, whether in respect of the
condescension that raised up martyrs, or that gave revelations; since
God always carries into effect what He has promised, for a testimony to
unbelievers, to believers for a benefit.  And we therefore, what we have
heard and handled, declare also to you, brethren and little children,
that as well you who were concerned in these matters may be reminded of
them again to the glory of the Lord, as that you who know them by report
may have communion with the blessed martyrs, and through them with the
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and honour, for ever and ever. <span
id="fr_8976"></span>[8977](#fn_8976.md) Amen.

<span id="vi.vi.ii-p4"></span> \[Both Perpetua and Felicitas were
evidently Montanistic in character and impressions, but, the fact that
they have never been reputed other than Catholic, goes far to explain
Tertullian’s position for years after he had withdrawn from communion
with the vacillating Victor.\]
