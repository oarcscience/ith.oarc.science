<span id="vi.iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Of the Necessity of Baptism to
Salvation.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii-p2"></span>When, however, the prescript is laid
down that “without baptism, salvation is attainable <span
id="page_675">p. 675</span> <span id="vi.iii.xii-Page_675"></span>by
none” (chiefly on the ground of that declaration of the Lord, who says,
“Unless one be born of water, he hath not life” <span
id="fr_8657"></span>[8658](#fn_8657) ), there arise immediately
scrupulous, nay rather audacious, doubts on the part of some, “how, in
accordance with that prescript, salvation is attainable by the apostles,
whom—Paul excepted—we do not find baptized in the Lord? Nay, since Paul
is the only one of them who has put on *the garment of* Christ’s
baptism, <span id="fr_8658"></span>[8659](#fn_8658) either the peril of
all the others who lack the water of Christ is prejudged, that the
prescript may be maintained, or else the prescript is rescinded if
salvation has been ordained even for the unbaptized.” I have heard—the
Lord is my witness—doubts of that kind: that none may imagine me so
abandoned as to excogitate, unprovoked, in the licence of my pen, ideas
which would inspire others with scruple.

<span id="vi.iii.xii-p5"></span>And now, as far as I shall be able, I
will reply to them who affirm “that the apostles were unbaptized.” For
if they had undergone the human baptism of John, and were longing for
that of the Lord, *then* since the Lord Himself had defined baptism to
be *one*; <span id="fr_8659"></span>[8660](#fn_8659) (saying to Peter,
who was desirous <span id="fr_8660"></span>[8661](#fn_8660) of being
thoroughly bathed, “He who hath once bathed hath no necessity *to wash*
a second time;” <span id="fr_8661"></span>[8662](#fn_8661) which, of
course, He would not have said at all to one *not* baptized;) even here
we have a conspicuous <span id="fr_8662"></span>[8663](#fn_8662) proof
against those who, in order to destroy the sacrament of water, deprive
the apostles even of John’s baptism. Can it seem credible that “the way
of the Lord,” that is, the baptism of John, had not then been “prepared”
in those persons who were being destined to *open* the way of the Lord
throughout the whole world? The Lord Himself, though no “repentance” was
due from *Him*, was baptized: was baptism not necessary for *sinners*? 
As for the fact, then, that “others were not baptized”—they, however,
were not companions of Christ, but enemies of the faith, doctors of the
law and Pharisees. From which fact is gathered an additional suggestion,
that, since the *opposers* of the Lord *refused* to be baptized, they
who *followed* the Lord *were* baptized, and were not like-minded with
their own rivals: especially when, if there were any one to whom they
clave, the Lord had exalted John above him (by the testimony) saying,
“Among them who are born of women *there is* none greater than John the
Baptist.” <span id="fr_8663"></span>[8664](#fn_8663)

<span id="vi.iii.xii-p11"></span>Others make the suggestion (forced
enough, clearly “that the apostles then served the turn of baptism when
in their little ship, were sprinkled and covered with the waves:  that
Peter himself also was immersed enough when he walked on the sea.” <span
id="fr_8664"></span>[8665](#fn_8664) It is, however, as I think, one
thing to be sprinkled or intercepted by the violence of the sea; another
thing to be baptized in obedience to the discipline of religion. But
that little ship did present a figure of the Church, in that she is
disquieted “in the sea,” that is, in the world, <span
id="fr_8665"></span>[8666](#fn_8665) “by the waves,” that is, by
persecutions and temptations; the Lord, through patience, sleeping as it
were, until, roused in their last extremities by the prayers of the
saints, He checks the world, <span id="fr_8666"></span>[8667](#fn_8666)
and restores tranquillity to His own.

<span id="vi.iii.xii-p15"></span>Now, whether they were baptized in any
manner whatever, or whether they continued unbathed <span
id="fr_8667"></span>[8668](#fn_8667) to the end—so that even that saying
of the Lord touching the “one bath” <span
id="fr_8668"></span>[8669](#fn_8668) does, under the person of Peter,
merely regard *us*—still, to determine concerning the salvation of the
apostles is audacious enough, because on *them* the prerogative even of
first choice, <span id="fr_8669"></span>[8670](#fn_8669) and thereafter
of undivided intimacy, might be able to confer the compendious grace of
baptism, seeing they (I think) followed Him who was wont to promise
salvation to every believer. “Thy faith,” He would say, “hath saved
thee;” <span id="fr_8670"></span>[8671](#fn_8670) and, “Thy sins shall
be remitted thee,” <span id="fr_8671"></span>[8672](#fn_8671) on thy
believing, of course, albeit thou be not *yet* baptized. If that <span
id="fr_8672"></span>[8673](#fn_8672) was wanting to the apostles, I know
not in the faith of what things it was, that, roused by one word of the
Lord, *one* left the toll-booth behind for ever; <span
id="fr_8673"></span>[8674](#fn_8673) *another* deserted father and ship,
and the craft by which he gained his living; <span
id="fr_8674"></span>[8675](#fn_8674) *a third*, who disdained his
father’s obsequies, <span id="fr_8675"></span>[8676](#fn_8675)
fulfilled, before he heard it, that highest precept of the Lord, “He who
prefers father or mother to me, is not worthy of me.” <span
id="fr_8676"></span>[8677](#fn_8676)
