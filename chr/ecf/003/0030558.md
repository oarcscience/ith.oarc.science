<span id="v.vii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Christ’s Nativity Both Possible
and Becoming. The Heretical Opinion of Christ’s Apparent Flesh Deceptive
and Dishonourable to God, Even on Marcion’s Principles.</span>

<span id="v.vii.iii-p2"></span>Since <span
id="fr_6969"></span>[6970](#fn_6969) you think that this lay within the
competency of your own arbitrary choice, you must needs have supposed
that being born <span id="fr_6970"></span>[6971](#fn_6970) was either
impossible for God, or unbecoming to Him. With God, however, nothing is
impossible but what He does not will. Let us consider, then, whether He
willed to be born (for if He had the will, He also had the power, and
was born). I put the argument very briefly. If God had willed not to be
born, it matters not why, He would not have presented Himself in the
likeness of man. Now who, when he sees a man, would deny that he had
been born?  What *God* therefore willed not to be, He would in no wise
have willed the seeming to be. When a thing is distasteful, the very
notion <span id="fr_6971"></span>[6972](#fn_6971) of it is scouted;
because it makes no difference whether a thing exist or <span
id="page_523">p. 523</span> <span id="v.vii.iii-Page_523"></span>do not
exist, if, when it does not exist, it is yet assumed to exist.  It is of
course of the greatest importance that there should be nothing false
(*or pretended*) attributed to that which really does not exist. <span
id="fr_6972"></span>[6973](#fn_6972) But, say you, His own consciousness
(of the truth of His nature) was enough for Him.  If any supposed that
He had been born, because they saw Him as a man, that was their
concern. <span id="fr_6973"></span>[6974](#fn_6973) Yet with how much
more dignity and consistency would He have sustained the human character
on the supposition that He was truly born; *for* if He were not born, He
could not have undertaken the said character without injury to that
consciousness of His which you on your side attribute to *His*
confidence of being able to sustain, although not born, the character of
having been born even against!  His own consciousness! <span
id="fr_6974"></span>[6975](#fn_6974) Why, I want to know, <span
id="fr_6975"></span>[6976](#fn_6975) was it of so much importance, that
Christ should, when perfectly aware what He really was, exhibit Himself
as being that which He was not? You cannot express any apprehension
that, <span id="fr_6976"></span>[6977](#fn_6976) if He had been born and
truly clothed Himself with man’s nature, He would have ceased to be God,
losing what He was, while becoming what He was not. For God is in no
danger of losing His own state and condition. But, say you, I deny that
God was truly changed to man in such wise as to be born and endued with
a body of flesh, on this ground, that a being who is without end is also
of necessity incapable of change. For being changed into something else
puts an end to the former state. Change, therefore, is not possible to a
Being who cannot come to an end. Without doubt, the nature of things
which are subject to change is regulated by this law, that they have no
permanence in the state which is undergoing change in them, and that
they come to an end from thus wanting permanence, whilst they lose that
in the process of change which they previously were. But nothing is
equal with God; His nature is different <span
id="fr_6977"></span>[6978](#fn_6977) from the condition of all things.
If, then, the things which differ from God, *and* from which God
differs, lose what existence they had whilst they are undergoing change,
wherein will consist the difference of the Divine Being from all other
things except in His possessing the contrary faculty of theirs,—in other
words, that God can be changed into all conditions, and yet continue
just as He is? On any other supposition, He would be on the same level
with those things which, when changed, lose the existence they had
before; whose equal, of course, He is not in any other respect, as He
certainly is not in the changeful issues <span
id="fr_6978"></span>[6979](#fn_6978) *of their nature*. You have
sometimes read and believed that the Creator’s angels have been changed
into human form, and have even borne about so veritable a body, that
Abraham even washed their feet, <span
id="fr_6979"></span>[6980](#fn_6979) and Lot was rescued from the
Sodomites by their hands; <span id="fr_6980"></span>[6981](#fn_6980) an
angel, moreover, wrestled with a man so strenuously with his body, that
the latter desired to be let loose, so tightly was he held. <span
id="fr_6981"></span>[6982](#fn_6981) Has it, then, been permitted to
angels, which are inferior to God, after they have been changed into
human bodily form, <span id="fr_6982"></span>[6983](#fn_6982)
nevertheless to remain angels? and will you deprive God, their superior,
of this faculty, as if Christ could not continue to be God, after His
real assumption of the nature of man? Or else, did those angels appear
as phantoms of flesh? You will not, however, have the courage to say
this; for if it be so held in your belief, that the Creator’s angels are
in the same condition as Christ, then Christ will belong to the same God
as those angels do, who are like Christ in their condition. If you had
not purposely rejected in some instances, and corrupted in others, the
Scriptures which are opposed to your opinion, you would have been
confuted in this matter by the Gospel of John, when it declares that the
Spirit descended in the body <span id="fr_6983"></span>[6984](#fn_6983)
of a dove, and sat upon the Lord. <span
id="fr_6984"></span>[6985](#fn_6984) When the said Spirit was in this
condition, He was as truly a dove as He was also a spirit; nor did He
destroy His own proper substance by the assumption of an extraneous
substance. But you ask what becomes of the dove’s body, after the return
of the Spirit back to heaven, and similarly in the case of the angels.
Their withdrawal was effected in the same manner as their appearance had
been.  If you had seen how their production out of nothing had been
effected, you would have known also the process of their return to
nothing. If the initial step was out of sight, so was also the final
one. Still there was solidity in their bodily substance, whatever may
have been the force by which the body became visible. What is written
cannot but have been.

<span id="v.vii.iii-p8"></span> It did not much matter (according to the
view which Tertullian attributes to Marcion) if God did practise
deception in affecting the assumption of a humanity which He knew to be
unreal. Men took it to be real, and that answered every purpose. God
knew better: and He was moreover, strong enough to obviate all
inconveniences of the deception by His unfaltering fortitude, etc. All
this, however, seemed to Tertullian to be simply damaging and perilous
to the character of God, even from Marcion’s own point of view.
