<span id="v.x.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.x.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.</span>

<span id="v.x.vii-p2"></span>If the scorpion, swinging his tail in the
air, still reproach us with having a murderer for our God, I shall
shudder at the altogether foul breath of blasphemy which comes stinking
from his heretical mouth; but I will embrace even such a God, with
assurance derived from reason, by which reason even He Himself has, in
the person of His own Wisdom, by the lips of Solomon, proclaimed Himself
to be more than a murderer: Wisdom (*Sophia*), says He has slain her own
children. <span id="fr_8256"></span>[8257](#fn_8256.md) *Sophia* is Wisdom.
She has certainly slain them wisely if only into life, and reasonably if
only into glory. Of murder by a parent, oh the clever form! Oh the
dexterity of crime! Oh the proof of cruelty, which has slain for this
reason, that he whom it may have slain may not die! And therefore what
follows? Wisdom is praised in hymns, in the places of egress; for the
death of martyrs also is praised in song. Wisdom behaves with firmness
in the streets, for with good results does she murder her own
sons. <span id="fr_8257"></span>[8258](#fn_8257.md) Nay, on the top of the
walls she speaks with assurance, when indeed, according to Esaias, this
one calls out, “I am God’s;” and this one shouts, “In the name of
Jacob;” and another writes, “In the name of Israel.” <span
id="fr_8258"></span>[8259](#fn_8258.md) O good mother! I myself also wish
to be put among the number of her sons, that I may be slain by her; I
wish to be slain, that I may become a son. But does she merely murder
her sons, or also torture them? For I hear God also, in another passage,
say, “I will burn them as gold is burned, and will try them as silver is
tried.” <span id="fr_8259"></span>[8260](#fn_8259.md) Certainly by the
means of torture which fires and punishments supply, by the testing
martyrdoms of faith. The apostle also knows what kind of God he has
ascribed to us, when he writes: “If God spared not His own Son, but gave
Him up for us, how did He not with Him also give us all things?” <span
id="fr_8260"></span>[8261](#fn_8260.md) You see how divine Wisdom has
murdered even her own proper, <span id="page_640">p. 640</span> <span
id="v.x.vii-Page_640"></span>first-born and only Son, who is certainly
about to live, nay, to bring back the others also into life. I can say
with the Wisdom of God; It is Christ who gave Himself up for our
offences. <span id="fr_8261"></span>[8262](#fn_8261.md) Already has Wisdom
butchered herself also. The character of words depends not on the sound
only, but on the meaning also, and they must be heard not merely by
ears, but also by minds. He who does not understand, believes God to be
cruel; although for him also who does not understand, an announcement
has been made to restrain his harshness in understanding otherwise *than
aright*. “For who,” says *the apostle*, “has known the mind of the Lord?
or who has been His counsellor, to teach Him? or who has pointed out to
Him the way of understanding?” <span
id="fr_8262"></span>[8263](#fn_8262.md) But, indeed, the world has held it
lawful for Diana of the Scythians, or Mercury of the Gauls, or Saturn of
the Africans, to be appeased by human sacrifices; and in Latium to this
day Jupiter has human blood given him to taste in the midst of the city;
and no one makes it a matter of discussion, or imagines that it does not
occur for some reason, or that it occurs by the will of his God, without
having value. If our God, too, to have a sacrifice of His own, had
required martyrdoms for Himself, who would have reproached Him for the
deadly religion, and the mournful ceremonies, and the altar-pyre, and
the undertaker-priest, and not rather have counted happy the man whom
God should have devoured?
