<span id="iv.xi.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL.—The Body of Man Only Ancillary to
the Soul in the Commission of Evil.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xl-p2"></span>Every soul, then, by reason of its birth,
has its nature in Adam until it is born again in Christ; moreover, it is
unclean all the while that it remains without this regeneration; <span
id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754) and because unclean, it is actively
sinful, and suffuses even the flesh (by reason of their conjunction)
with its own shame. Now although the flesh is sinful, and we are
forbidden to walk in accordance with it, <span
id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755) and its works are condemned as
lusting against the spirit, <span id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756)
and men on its account are censured as carnal, <span
id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757) yet the flesh has not such ignominy
on its own account. For it is not of itself that it thinks anything or
feels anything for the purpose of advising or commanding sin. How should
it, indeed? It is only a ministering thing, and its ministration is not
like that of a servant or familiar friend—animated and human beings; but
rather that of a vessel, or something of that kind: it is body, not
soul. Now a cup may minister to a thirsty man; and yet, if the thirsty
man will not apply the cup to his mouth, the cup will yield no
ministering service. Therefore the *differentia*, or distinguishing
property, of man by no means lies in his earthy element; nor is the
flesh the human person, as being some faculty of his soul, and a
personal quality; but it is a thing of quite a different substance and
different condition, although annexed to the soul as a chattel or as an
instrument for the offices of life. Accordingly the flesh is blamed in
the Scriptures, because nothing is done by the soul without the flesh in
operations of concupiscence, appetite, drunkenness, cruelty, idolatry,
and other works of the flesh,—operations, I mean, which are not confined
to sensations, but result in effects. The emotions of sin, indeed, when
not resulting in effects, are usually imputed to the soul: “Whosoever
looketh on a woman to lust after, hath already in his heart committed
adultery with her.” <span id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758) But what
has the flesh alone, without the soul, ever done in operations of
virtue, righteousness, endurance, or chastity? What absurdity, however,
it is to attribute sin and crime to that substance to which you do not
assign any good actions or character of its own!  Now the party which
aids in the commission of a crime is brought to trial, only in such a
way that the principal offender who actually committed the crime may
bear the weight of the penalty, although the abettor too does not escape
indictment. Greater is the odium which falls on the principal, when his
officials are punished through his fault. He is beaten with more stripes
who instigates and orders the crime, whilst at the same time he who
obeys such an evil command is not acquitted.
