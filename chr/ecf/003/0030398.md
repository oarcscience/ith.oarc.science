<span id="v.iv.iv.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Christ’s Millennial and
Heavenly Glory in Company with His Saints.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xxiv-p2"></span>Yes, certainly, <span
id="fr_3434"></span>[3435](#fn_3434.md) you say, I do hope from Him that
which amounts in itself to a proof of the diversity (of Christs), God’s
kingdom in an everlasting and heavenly possession. Besides, your Christ
promises to the Jews their primitive condition, with the recovery of
their country; and after this life’s course is over, repose in
Hades <span id="fr_3435"></span>[3436](#fn_3435.md) in Abraham’s bosom. Oh,
most excellent God, when He restores in amnesty <span
id="fr_3436"></span>[3437](#fn_3436.md) what He took away in wrath! Oh,
what a God is yours, who both wounds and heals, creates evil and makes
peace! Oh, what a God, that is merciful even down to Hades! I shall have
something to say about Abraham’s bosom in the proper place. <span
id="fr_3437"></span>[3438](#fn_3437.md) As for the restoration of Judæa,
however, which even the Jews themselves, induced by the names of places
and countries, hope for just as it is described, <span
id="fr_3438"></span>[3439](#fn_3438.md) it would be tedious to state at
length <span id="fr_3439"></span>[3440](#fn_3439.md) how the
figurative <span id="fr_3440"></span>[3441](#fn_3440.md) interpretation is
spiritually applicable to Christ and His church, and to the character
and fruits thereof; besides, the subject has been regularly
treated <span id="fr_3441"></span>[3442](#fn_3441.md) in another work,
which we entitle *De Spe Fidelium*. <span
id="fr_3442"></span>[3443](#fn_3442.md) At present, too, it would be
superfluous <span id="fr_3443"></span>[3444](#fn_3443.md) for this reason,
that our inquiry relates to what is promised in heaven, not on earth.
But we do confess that a kingdom is promised to us upon the earth,
although before heaven, only in another state of existence; inasmuch as
it will be after the resurrection for a thousand years in the
divinely-built city of Jerusalem, <span
id="fr_3444"></span>[3445](#fn_3444.md) “let down from heaven,” <span
id="fr_3445"></span>[3446](#fn_3445.md) which the apostle also calls “our
mother from above;” <span id="fr_3446"></span>[3447](#fn_3446.md) and,
while declaring that our <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xxiv-p15.2"></span>πολίτευμα</span> , or citizenship, is in
heaven, <span id="fr_3447"></span>[3448](#fn_3447.md) he predicates of
it <span id="fr_3448"></span>[3449](#fn_3448.md) that it is really a city
in heaven. This both Ezekiel had knowledge of <span
id="fr_3449"></span>[3450](#fn_3449.md) and the Apostle John beheld. <span
id="fr_3450"></span>[3451](#fn_3450.md) And the word of the new prophecy
which is a part of our belief, <span
id="fr_3451"></span>[3452](#fn_3451.md) attests how it foretold that there
would be for a sign a picture of this very city exhibited to view
previous to its manifestation. This prophecy, indeed, has been very
lately fulfilled in an expedition to the East. <span
id="fr_3452"></span>[3453](#fn_3452.md) For it is evident from the
testimony of even heathen witnesses, that in Judæa there was suspended
<span id="page_343">p. 343</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.xxiv-Page_343"></span>in the sky a city early every morning
for forty days. As the day advanced, the entire figure of its walls
would wane gradually, <span id="fr_3453"></span>[3454](#fn_3453.md) and
sometimes it would vanish instantly. <span
id="fr_3454"></span>[3455](#fn_3454.md) We say that this city has been
provided by God for receiving the saints on their resurrection, and
refreshing them with the abundance of all really spiritual blessings, as
a recompense for those which in the world we have either despised or
lost; since it is both just and God-worthy that His servants should have
their joy in the place where they have also suffered affliction for His
name’s sake.  Of the heavenly kingdom this is the process. <span
id="fr_3455"></span>[3456](#fn_3455.md) After its thousand years are over,
within which period is completed the resurrection of the saints, who
rise sooner or later according to their deserts there will ensue the
destruction of the world and the conflagration of all things at the
judgment: we shall then be changed in a moment into the substance of
angels, even by the investiture of an incorruptible nature, and so be
removed to that kingdom in heaven of which we have now been treating,
just as if it had not been predicted by the Creator, and as if it were
proving Christ to belong to the other god and as if he were the first
and sole revealer of it. But now learn that it has been, in fact,
predicted by the Creator, and that even without prediction it has a
claim upon our faith in respect of <span
id="fr_3456"></span>[3457](#fn_3456.md) the Creator. What appears to be
probable to you, when Abraham’s seed, after the primal promise of being
like the sand of the sea for multitude, is destined likewise to an
equality with the stars of heaven—are not these the indications both of
an earthly and a heavenly dispensation? <span
id="fr_3457"></span>[3458](#fn_3457.md) When Isaac, in blessing his son
Jacob, says, “God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the
earth,” <span id="fr_3458"></span>[3459](#fn_3458.md) are there not in his
words examples of both kinds of blessing? Indeed, the very form of the
blessing is in this instance worthy of notice. For in relation to Jacob,
who is the type of the later and more excellent people, that is to say
ourselves, <span id="fr_3459"></span>[3460](#fn_3459.md) first comes the
promise of the heavenly dew, and afterwards that about the fatness of
the earth. So are we first invited to heavenly blessings when we are
separated from the world, and afterwards we thus find ourselves in the
way of obtaining also earthly blessings. And your own gospel likewise
has it in this wise: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and these things
shall be added unto you.” <span id="fr_3460"></span>[3461](#fn_3460.md) But
to Esau the blessing promised is an earthly one, which he supplements
with a heavenly, after the fatness of the earth, saying, “Thy dwelling
shall be also of the dew of heaven.” <span
id="fr_3461"></span>[3462](#fn_3461.md) For the dispensation of the Jews
(who were in Esau, the prior of the sons in birth, but the later in
affection <span id="fr_3462"></span>[3463](#fn_3462) .md) at first was
imbued with earthly blessings through the law, and afterwards brought
round to heavenly ones through the gospel by faith. When Jacob sees in
his dream the steps of a ladder set upon the earth, and reaching to
heaven, with angels ascending and descending thereon, and the Lord
standing above, we shall without hesitation venture to suppose, <span
id="fr_3463"></span>[3464](#fn_3463.md) that by this ladder the Lord has in
judgment appointed that the way to heaven is shown to men, whereby some
may attain to it, and others fall therefrom. For why, as soon as he
awoke out of his sleep, and shook through a dread of the spot, does he
fall to an interpretation of his dream? He exclaims, “How terrible is
this place!” And then adds, “This is none other than the house of God;
this is the gate of heaven!” <span id="fr_3464"></span>[3465](#fn_3464.md)
For he had seen Christ the Lord, the temple of God, and also the gate by
whom heaven is entered. Now surely he would not have mentioned the gate
of heaven, if heaven is not entered in the dispensation of the <span
id="fr_3465"></span>[3466](#fn_3465.md) Creator. But there is now a gate
provided by Christ, which admits and conducts *to glory*. Of this Amos
says: “He buildeth His ascensions into heaven;” <span
id="fr_3466"></span>[3467](#fn_3466.md) certainly not for Himself alone,
but for His people also, who will be with Him. “And Thou shalt bind them
about Thee,” says he, “like the adornment of a bride.” <span
id="fr_3467"></span>[3468](#fn_3467.md) Accordingly the Spirit, admiring
such as soar up to the celestial realms by these ascensions, says, “They
fly, as if they were kites; they fly as clouds, and as young doves, unto
me” <span id="fr_3468"></span>[3469](#fn_3468.md) —that is, simply like a
dove. <span id="fr_3469"></span>[3470](#fn_3469.md) For we shall, according
to the apostle, be caught up into the clouds to meet the Lord (even the
Son of man, who shall come in the clouds, according to Daniel <span
id="fr_3470"></span>[3471](#fn_3470) .md) and so shall we ever be with the
Lord, <span id="fr_3471"></span>[3472](#fn_3471.md) so long as He remains
both on the earth and in heaven, who, against such as are thankless
<span id="page_344">p. 344</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.xxiv-Page_344"></span>for both one promise and the other,
calls the elements themselves to witness: “Hear, O heaven, and give ear,
O earth.” <span id="fr_3472"></span>[3473](#fn_3472.md) Now, for my own
part indeed, even though Scripture held out no hand of heavenly hope to
me (as, in fact, it so often does), I should still possess a sufficient
presumption <span id="fr_3473"></span>[3474](#fn_3473.md) of even this
promise, in my present enjoyment of the earthly gift; and I should look
out for something also of the heavenly, from Him who is the God of
heaven as well as of earth. I should thus believe that the Christ who
promises the higher blessings is (the Son) of Him who had also promised
the lower ones; who had, moreover, afforded proofs of greater gifts by
smaller ones; who had reserved for His Christ alone this
revelation <span id="fr_3474"></span>[3475](#fn_3474.md) of a
(perhaps <span id="fr_3475"></span>[3476](#fn_3475) .md) unheard of
kingdom, so that, while the earthly glory was announced by His servants,
the heavenly might have God Himself for its messenger. *You*, however,
argue for another Christ, from the very circumstance that He proclaims a
new kingdom. You ought first to bring forward some example of His
beneficence, <span id="fr_3476"></span>[3477](#fn_3476.md) that I may have
no good reason for doubting the credibility of the great promise, which
you say ought to be hoped for; nay, it is before all things necessary
that you should prove that a heaven belongs to Him, whom you declare to
be a promiser of heavenly things. As it is, you invite us to dinner, but
do not point out your house; you assert a kingdom, but show us no royal
state. <span id="fr_3477"></span>[3478](#fn_3477.md) Can it be that your
Christ promises a kingdom of heaven, without having a heaven; as He
displayed Himself man, without having flesh? O what a phantom from first
to last! <span id="fr_3478"></span>[3479](#fn_3478.md) O hollow pretence of
a mighty promise!
