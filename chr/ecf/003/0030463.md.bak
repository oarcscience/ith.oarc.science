<span id="v.iv.vi.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—The Epistle to the
Laodiceans. The Proper Designation is to the Ephesians. Recapitulation
of All Things in Christ from the Beginning of the Creation.  No Room for
Marcion’s Christ Here.  Numerous Parallels Between This Epistle and
Passages in the Old Testament. The Prince of the Power of the Air, and
the God of This World—Who?  Creation and Regeneration the Work of One
God. How Christ Has Made the Law Obsolete. A Vain Erasure of Marcion’s.
The Apostles as Well as the Prophets from the Creator.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.xvii-p2"></span>We have it on the true tradition <span
id="fr_5947"></span>[5948](#fn_5947.md) of the Church, that this epistle
was sent to the Ephe<span id="page_465">p. 465</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xvii-Page_465"></span>sians, not to the Laodiceans. Marcion,
however, was very desirous of giving it the new title (of
Laodicean), <span id="fr_5948"></span>[5949](#fn_5948.md) as if he were
extremely accurate in investigating such a point. But of what
consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the
apostle did in fact write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were
to whom he wrote, <span id="fr_5949"></span>[5950](#fn_5949.md) he declared
Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are
predicted. <span id="fr_5950"></span>[5951](#fn_5950.md) Now, to what god
will most suitably belong all those things which relate to “that good
pleasure, which *God* hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in
the dispensation of the fulness of times He might *recapitulate*” (if I
may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word <span
id="fr_5951"></span>[5952](#fn_5951) .md) “all things in Christ, both which
are in heaven and which are on earth,” <span
id="fr_5952"></span>[5953](#fn_5952.md) but to Him whose are all things
from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the
times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which
all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What
*beginning*, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can
anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no
beginning, how can there be *times*? If no times, what *fulness* of
times can there be?  And if no fulness, what *dispensation*? Indeed,
what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to
be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all
things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose
that any things whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any
other God than Him by whom, as all men allow, all things have been done
on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the
beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will
believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ,
instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ?  If, again, they
belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god;
and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be
gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again,
what Christ do the following words announce, when *the apostle* says:
“That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in
Christ?” <span id="fr_5953"></span>[5954](#fn_5953.md) Now who could have
first trusted—*i.e. previously* trusted <span
id="fr_5954"></span>[5955](#fn_5954.md) —in God, before His advent, except
the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He
who was thus *foretold*, was also *foretrusted*. Hence the apostle
refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he
may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to
say:) “In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth,
the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed
with His Holy Spirit of promise.” <span
id="fr_5955"></span>[5956](#fn_5955.md) Of what promise? That which was
made through Joel: “In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon
all flesh,” <span id="fr_5956"></span>[5957](#fn_5956.md) that is, on all
nations. Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the
Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold. Again, “the Father of
glory” <span id="fr_5957"></span>[5958](#fn_5957.md) is He whose Christ,
when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as “the King of Glory” in the
Psalm: “Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of
Glory.” <span id="fr_5958"></span>[5959](#fn_5958.md) From Him also is
besought “the spirit of wisdom,” <span
id="fr_5959"></span>[5960](#fn_5959.md) at whose disposal is enumerated
that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah. <span
id="fr_5960"></span>[5961](#fn_5960.md) He likewise will grant “the
enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,” <span
id="fr_5961"></span>[5962](#fn_5961.md) who has also enriched our natural
eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is
offensive:  “And who is blind, but my servants?…yea, the servants of God
have become blind.” <span id="fr_5962"></span>[5963](#fn_5962.md) In His
gift, too, are “the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the
saints,” <span id="fr_5963"></span>[5964](#fn_5963.md) who promised such an
inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: “Ask of me, and I will give
Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.” <span
id="fr_5964"></span>[5965](#fn_5964.md) It was He who “wrought in Christ
His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His
own right hand, and putting all things under His feet” <span
id="fr_5965"></span>[5966](#fn_5965.md) —even the same who said: “Sit Thou
on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.” <span
id="fr_5966"></span>[5967](#fn_5966.md) For in another passage the Spirit
says to the Father concerning the Son: “Thou hast put all things under
His feet.” <span id="fr_5967"></span>[5968](#fn_5967.md) Now, if from all
these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be
deduced <span id="fr_5968"></span>[5969](#fn_5968.md) another god and
another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose,
forsooth, <span id="fr_5969"></span>[5970](#fn_5969.md) we find Him, when
he speaks of such as “were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had
walked <span id="page_466">p. 466</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xvii-Page_466"></span>according to the course of this world,
according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the
children of disobedience.” <span id="fr_5970"></span>[5971](#fn_5970.md)
But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the
world. <span id="fr_5971"></span>[5972](#fn_5971.md) For a creature bears
no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the
world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of the power of the
ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the
air; for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from
the lower powers, although these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor,
again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator <span
id="fr_5972"></span>[5973](#fn_5972.md) of that unbelief which He Himself
had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We
may therefore simply conclude that <span
id="fr_5973"></span>[5974](#fn_5973.md) these designations are unsuited to
the Creator.  There is another being to whom they are more
applicable—and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he?
Undoubtedly he who has raised up “children of disobedience” against the
Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that “*air*” of His;
even as the prophet makes him say: “I will set my throne *above the
stars*;…*I will go up* above the clouds; I will be like the Most
High.” <span id="fr_5974"></span>[5975](#fn_5974.md) This must mean the
devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the
apostle’s meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation *the god
of this world*. <span id="fr_5975"></span>[5976](#fn_5975.md) For he has
filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To
be sure, <span id="fr_5976"></span>[5977](#fn_5976.md) if *he* had not
existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the
Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he
parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), “in
which also we all had our conversation in times past,” <span
id="fr_5977"></span>[5978](#fn_5977.md) he must not be understood to
indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of
this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the
children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator—when he
persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says:
“We also were the children of wrath,” but “by nature.” <span
id="fr_5978"></span>[5979](#fn_5978.md) Let the heretic, however, not
contend that, because the Creator called the Jews *children*, therefore
the Creator is the lord of wrath. <span
id="fr_5979"></span>[5980](#fn_5979) For when (the apostle.md) says, “We
were by nature the children of wrath,” inasmuch as the Jews were not the
Creator’s children *by nature*, but by the election of their fathers, he
(must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to
the Creator, adding this at last, “even as others,” <span
id="fr_5980"></span>[5981](#fn_5980.md) who, of course, were not children
of God.  It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief,
and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil
however leading that nature astray, <span
id="fr_5981"></span>[5982](#fn_5981.md) which he has already infected with
the implanted germ of sin. “We,” says he, “are His workmanship, created
in Christ.” <span id="fr_5982"></span>[5983](#fn_5982.md) It is one thing
to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to
One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man
(at first), created him also in Christ.  As touching the substance of
nature, He “made” him; as touching the work of grace, He “created” him.
Look also at what follows in connection with these words:  “Wherefore
remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are
called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the
flesh made by the hand—that at that time ye were without Christ, being
aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants
of promise, <span id="fr_5983"></span>[5984](#fn_5983.md) having no hope,
and without God in the world.” <span
id="fr_5984"></span>[5985](#fn_5984.md) Now, without what God and without
what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely, without Him to whom the
commonwealth <span id="fr_5985"></span>[5986](#fn_5985.md) of Israel
belonged, and the covenants and the promise. “But now in Christ,” says
he, “ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.” <span
id="fr_5986"></span>[5987](#fn_5986.md) From whom were they far off before?
From the (privileges) whereof he speaks above, even from the Christ of
the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from
the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the
Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings),
from which they were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so
very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel, which comprises the religion of
the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise, yea to
their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the
Christ of the other god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator
from afar. The apostle had in mind that it had been predicted concerning
the call of <span id="page_467">p. 467</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xvii-Page_467"></span>the Gentiles from their distant
alienation in words like these: “They who were far off from me have come
to my righteousness.” <span id="fr_5987"></span>[5988](#fn_5987.md) For the
Creator’s righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ,
as we have often shown already. Therefore he says: “He is our peace, who
hath made both one” <span id="fr_5988"></span>[5989](#fn_5988.md) —that is,
the Jewish nation and the Gentile world.  What is near, and what was far
off now that “the middle wall has been broken down” of their “enmity,”
(are made one) “in His flesh.” <span
id="fr_5989"></span>[5990](#fn_5989.md) But Marcion erased the pronoun
*His*, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the apostle
spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to
Christ. <span id="fr_5990"></span>[5991](#fn_5990.md) And thus you have (as
I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than
the adroitness of a Marrucinian, <span
id="fr_5991"></span>[5992](#fn_5991.md) for you here deny him *flesh* to
whom in the verse above you allowed *blood*! Since, however, He has made
the law obsolete <span id="fr_5992"></span>[5993](#fn_5992.md) by His own
precepts, even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, “Thou
shalt not commit adultery,” when He says, “Thou shalt not look on a
woman to lust after her;” superfluous also is, “Thou shalt do no
murder,” when He says, “Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,”) it
is impossible to make an adversary of the law out of one who so
completely promotes it. <span id="fr_5993"></span>[5994](#fn_5993.md) “For
to create <span id="fr_5994"></span>[5995](#fn_5994.md) in Himself of
twain,” for He who had *made* is also the same who *creates* (just as we
have found it stated above: “For we are His workmanship, created in
Christ *Jesus*”), <span id="fr_5995"></span>[5996](#fn_5995.md) “one new
man, making peace” (really new, and really man—no phantom—but new, and
newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), “that He might reconcile
both unto God” <span id="fr_5996"></span>[5997](#fn_5996.md) (even the God
whom both races had offended—both Jew and Gentile), “in one body,” says
he, “having in it slain the enmity by the cross.” <span
id="fr_5997"></span>[5998](#fn_5997.md) Thus we find from this passage
also, that there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to
endure the cross. “When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them
that were near and to them which were afar off,” we both obtained
“access to the Father,” being “now no more strangers and foreigners, but
fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God” (even of
Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far
off), “built upon the foundation of the apostles” <span
id="fr_5998"></span>[5999](#fn_5998) —(the apostle added.md), “and the
prophets;” these words, however, the heretic erased, forgetting that the
Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also. He
feared, no doubt, that our building was to stand in Christ upon the
foundation of the ancient prophets, <span
id="fr_5999"></span>[6000](#fn_5999.md) since the apostle himself never
fails to build us up everywhere with (the words of) the prophets. For
whence did he learn to call Christ “the chief corner-stone,” <span
id="fr_6000"></span>[6001](#fn_6000.md) but from the figure given him in
the Psalm:  “The stone which the builders rejected is become the head
(stone) of the corner?” <span id="fr_6001"></span>[6002](#fn_6001.md)
