id="v.vi.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—Less Reprehensible Theories
in the Heresy.  Bad is the Best of Valentinianism.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxvi-p2"></span>How much more sensible are they who,
rejecting all this tiresome nonsense, have refused to believe that any
one Æon has descended from another by steps like these, which are really
neither more nor less *Gemonian*; <span
id="fr_6919"></span>[6920](#fn_6919.md) but that on a given signal <span
id="fr_6920"></span>[6921](#fn_6920.md) the eight-fold emanation, of which
we have heard, <span id="fr_6921"></span>[6922](#fn_6921.md) issued all at
once from the Father and His Ennœa (*Thought*), <span
id="fr_6922"></span>[6923](#fn_6922.md) —that it is, in fact, from His mere
motion that they gain their designations. When, as they say, He thought
of producing offspring, He on that account gained the name of <span
class="sc"><span id="v.vi.xxxvi-p6.1"></span>Father</span>. After
producing, because the issue which He produced was true, He received the
name of *Truth*. When He wanted Himself to be manifested, He on that
account was announced as *Man*. Those, moreover, whom He preconceived in
His thought when He produced them, were then designated *the Church*. As
man, He uttered <span id="page_520">p. 520</span> <span
id="v.vi.xxxvi-Page_520"></span>His *Word*; and so this *Word* is His
first-begotten Son, and to the Word was added *Life*. And by this
process the first Ogdoad was completed. However, the whole of this
tiresome story is utterly poor and weak.

by hooks, to be cast into the river.
