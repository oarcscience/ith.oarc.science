<span id="v.iv.ii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Unity of God. He is the
Supreme Being, and There Cannot Be a Second Supreme.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.iii-p2"></span>The principal, and indeed <span
id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359.md) the whole, contention lies in the
point of *number*: whether two Gods may be admitted, by poetic licence
(if they must be), <span id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360.md) or
pictorial fancy, or by the third process, as we must now add, <span
id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361.md) of heretical pravity. But the
Christian verity has distinctly declared this principle, “God is not, if
He is not one;” because we more properly believe that that has no
existence which is not as it ought to be. In order, however, that you
may know that God is one, ask what God is, and you will find Him to be
not otherwise than one. So far as a human being can form a definition of
God, I adduce one which the conscience of all men will also
acknowledge,—that God is the great Supreme existing in eternity,
unbegotten, unmade without beginning, without end. For such a condition
as this must needs be ascribed to that eternity which makes God to be
the great Supreme, because for such a purpose as this is this very
attribute <span id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362.md) in God; and so on
as to the other qualities:  so that God is the great Supreme in form and
in reason, and in might and in power. <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363.md) Now, since all are agreed on this
point (because nobody will deny that God is in some sense <span
id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364.md) the great Supreme, except the man
who shall be able to pronounce the opposite opinion, that God is but
some inferior being, in order that he may deny God by robbing Him of an
attribute of God), what must be the condition of the great Supreme
Himself? Surely it must be that nothing is equal to Him, *i.e.* that
there is no other great supreme; because, if there were, He would have
an equal; and if He had an equal, He would be no longer the great
Supreme, now that the condition and (so to say) our law, which permits
nothing to be equal to the great Supreme, is subverted. That Being,
then, which is the great Supreme, must needs be *unique*, <span
id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365.md) by having no equal, and so not
ceasing to be the great Supreme. Therefore He will not otherwise exist
than by the condition whereby He has His being; that is, by His absolute
uniqueness. Since, then, God is the great Supreme, our *Christian*
verity has rightly declared, <span id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md)
“God is not, if He is not one.” Not as if we doubted His being God, by
saying, He is not, if He is not one; but because we define Him, in whose
being we thoroughly believe, to be that without which He is not God;
that is to say, the great Supreme. But then <span
id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) the great Supreme must needs be
unique.  This Unique Being, therefore, will be God—not otherwise God
than as the great Supreme; and not otherwise the great Supreme than as
having no equal; and not otherwise having no equal than as being Unique.
Whatever other god, then, you may introduce, you will at least be unable
to maintain his divinity under any other guise, <span
id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368.md) than by ascribing to him too the
property of Godhead—both eternity and supremacy over all. How,
therefore, can two great Supremes co-exist, when this is the attribute
of the Supreme Being, to have no equal,—an attribute which belongs to
One alone, and can by no means exist in two?
