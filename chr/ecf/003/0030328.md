<span id="v.iv.ii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—All Portions of Creation
Attest the Excellence of the Creator, Whom Marcion Vilifies. His
Inconsistency Herein Exposed. Marcion’s Own God Did Not Hesitate to Use
the Creator’s Works in Instituting His Own Religion.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xiv-p2"></span>Now, when you make merry with those
minuter animals, which their glorious Maker has purposely endued with a
profusion of instincts and resources, <span
id="fr_2487"></span>[2488](#fn_2487.md) —thereby teaching us that greatness
has its proofs in lowliness, just as (according to the apostle) there is
power even in infirmity <span id="fr_2488"></span>[2489](#fn_2488.md)
—imitate, if you can, the cells of the bee, the hills of the ant, the
webs of the spider, and the threads of the silkworm; endure, too, if you
know how, those very creatures <span
id="fr_2489"></span>[2490](#fn_2489.md) which infest your couch and house,
the poisonous ejections of the blister-beetle, <span
id="fr_2490"></span>[2491](#fn_2490.md) the spikes of the fly, and the
gnat’s sheath and sting. What of the greater animals, when the small
ones so affect you with pleasure or pain, that you cannot even in their
case despise their Creator? Finally, take a circuit round your own self;
survey man within and without. Even this handiwork of our God will be
pleasing to you, inasmuch as your own lord, that better god, loved it so
well, <span id="fr_2491"></span>[2492](#fn_2491.md) and for your sake was
at the pains <span id="fr_2492"></span>[2493](#fn_2492.md) of descending
from the third heaven to these poverty-stricken <span
id="fr_2493"></span>[2494](#fn_2493.md) elements, and for the same reason
was actually crucified in this sorry <span
id="fr_2494"></span>[2495](#fn_2494.md) apartment of the Creator. Indeed,
up to the present time, he has not disdained the water which the Creator
made wherewith he washes his people; nor the oil with which he anoints
them; nor that union of honey and milk wherewithal he gives them the
nourishment <span id="fr_2495"></span>[2496](#fn_2495.md) of children; nor
the bread by which he represents his own proper body, thus requiring in
his very sacraments the “beggarly <span
id="fr_2496"></span>[2497](#fn_2496.md) elements” of the Creator. You,
however, are a disciple above his master, and a servant above his lord;
you have a higher reach of discernment than his; you destroy what he
requires. I wish to examine whether you are at least honest in this, so
as to have no longing for those things which you destroy. You are an
enemy to the sky, and yet you are glad to catch its freshness in your
houses. You disparage the earth, although the elemental parent <span
id="fr_2497"></span>[2498](#fn_2497.md) of your own flesh, as if it were
your undoubted enemy, and yet you extract from it all its fatness <span
id="fr_2498"></span>[2499](#fn_2498.md) for your food. The sea, too, you
reprobate, but are continually using its produce, which you account the
more sacred diet. <span id="fr_2499"></span>[2500](#fn_2499.md) If I should
offer you a rose, you will not disdain its Maker. You hypocrite, however
much of abstinence you use to show yourself a Marcionite, that is, a
repudiator of your Maker (for if the world displeased you, such
abstinence ought to have been affected by you as a martyrdom), you will
have to associate yourself with <span
id="fr_2500"></span>[2501](#fn_2500.md) the Creator’s material production,
into what element soever you shall be dissolved. How hard is this
obstinacy of yours! You vilify the things in which you both live and
die.

the Place Occupied by the Rival Deities. Instead of Two Gods, Marcion
