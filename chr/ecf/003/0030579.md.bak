<span id="v.vii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Divine Strictures on Various
Heretics Descried in Various Passages of Prophetical Scripture. Those
Who Assail the True Doctrine of the One Lord Jesus Christ, Both God and
Man, Thus Condemned.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xxiv-p2"></span>For when Isaiah hurls denunciation
against our very heretics, especially in his “Woe to them that call evil
good, and put darkness for light,” <span
id="fr_7268"></span>[7269](#fn_7268.md) he of course sets his mark upon
those amongst you <span id="fr_7269"></span>[7270](#fn_7269.md) who
preserve not in the words they employ the light of their true
significance, (by taking care) that the *soul* should mean only that
which is so called, and the *flesh* simply that which is confest to our
view, and *God* none other than the One who is preached. <span
id="fr_7270"></span>[7271](#fn_7270.md) Having thus Marcion in his
prophetic view, he says, “I am God, and there is none else; there is no
God beside me.” <span id="fr_7271"></span>[7272](#fn_7271.md) And when in
another passage he says, in like manner, “Before me there was no
God,” <span id="fr_7272"></span>[7273](#fn_7272.md) he strikes at those
inexplicable genealogies of the Valentinian Æons. Again, there is an
answer to Ebion in the Scripture: “Born, <span
id="fr_7273"></span>[7274](#fn_7273.md) not of blood, nor <span
id="page_542">p. 542</span> <span id="v.vii.xxiv-Page_542"></span>of the
will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.” In like manner,
in the passage, “If even an angel of heaven preach unto you any other
gospel than *that which* we *have* preached unto you, let him be
anathema,” <span id="fr_7274"></span>[7275](#fn_7274.md) he calls attention
to the artful influence of Philumene, <span
id="fr_7275"></span>[7276](#fn_7275.md) the virgin friend of Apelles.
Surely he is antichrist who denies that Christ has come in the
flesh. <span id="fr_7276"></span>[7277](#fn_7276.md) By declaring that His
flesh is simply and absolutely true, and taken in the plain sense of its
own nature, *the Scripture* aims a blow at all who make distinctions in
it. <span id="fr_7277"></span>[7278](#fn_7277.md) In the same way, also,
when it defines the very Christ to be but one, it shakes the fancies of
those who exhibit a multiform Christ, who make Christ to be one being
and Jesus another,—representing one as escaping out of the midst of the
crowds, and the other as detained by them; one as appearing on a
solitary mountain to three companions, clothed with glory in a cloud,
the other as an ordinary man holding intercourse with all, <span
id="fr_7278"></span>[7279](#fn_7278.md) one as magnanimous, but the other
as timid; lastly, one as suffering death, the other as risen again, by
means of which event they maintain a resurrection of their own also,
only in another flesh.  Happily, however, He who suffered “will come
again from heaven,” <span id="fr_7279"></span>[7280](#fn_7279.md) and by
all shall He be seen, who rose again from the dead. They too who
crucified Him shall see and acknowledge Him; that is to say, His very
flesh, against which they spent their fury, and without which it would
be impossible for Himself either to exist or to be seen; so that they
must blush with shame who affirm that His flesh sits in heaven void of
sensation, like a sheath only, Christ being withdrawn from it; as well
as those who (maintain) that His flesh and soul are just the same
thing, <span id="fr_7280"></span>[7281](#fn_7280.md) or else that His soul
is all that exists, <span id="fr_7281"></span>[7282](#fn_7281.md) but that
His flesh no longer lives.
