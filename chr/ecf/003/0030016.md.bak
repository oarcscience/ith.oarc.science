<span id="iv.iii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.x-p2"></span>“You do not worship the gods,” you say;
“and you do not offer sacrifices for the emperors.” Well, we do not
offer sacrifice for others, for the same reason that we do not for
ourselves,—namely, that your gods are not at all the objects of our
worship.  So we are accused of sacrilege and treason. This is the chief
ground of charge against us—nay, it is the sum-total of our offending;
and it is worthy then of being inquired into, if neither prejudice nor
injustice be the judge, the one of which has no idea of discovering the
truth, and the other simply and at once rejects it. We do not worship
your gods, because we know that there are no such beings.  This,
therefore, is what you should do:  you should call on us to demonstrate
their non-existence, and thereby prove that they have no claim to
adoration; for only if your gods were truly so, would there be any
obligation to render divine homage to them. And punishment even were due
to Christians, if it were made plain that those to whom they refused all
worship were indeed divine. But you say, They are gods. We protest and
appeal from yourselves to your knowledge; let that judge us; let that
condemn us, if it can deny that all these gods of yours were but men. If
even it venture to deny that, it will be confuted by its own books of
antiquities, from which it has got its information about them, bearing
witness to this day, as they plainly do, both of the cities in which
they were born, and the countries in which they have left traces of
their exploits, as well as where also they are proved to have been
buried.  Shall I now, therefore, go over them one by one, so numerous
and so various, new and old, barbarian, Grecian, Roman, foreign, captive
and adopted, private and common, male and female, rural and urban, naval
and military? It were useless even to hunt out all their names: so I may
content myself with a compend; and this not for your information, but
that you may have what you know brought to your recollection, for
undoubtedly you act as if you had forgotten all about them. No one of
your gods is earlier than Saturn: from him you trace all your deities,
even those of higher rank and better known. What, then, can be proved of
the first, will apply to those that follow. So far, then, as books give
us information, neither the Greek Diodorus or Thallus, neither Cassius
Severus or Cornelius Nepos, nor any writer upon sacred antiquities, have
ventured to say that Saturn was any but a man: so far as the question
depends on facts, I find none more trustworthy than those<span
id="page_27">p. 27</span> <span id="iv.iii.x-Page_27"></span>—that in
Italy itself we have the country in which, after many expeditions, and
after having partaken of Attic hospitalities, Saturn settled, obtaining
cordial welcome from Janus, or, as the Salii will have it, Janis. The
mountain on which he dwelt was called Saturnius; the city he founded is
called Saturnia to this day; last of all, the whole of Italy, after
having borne the name of Oenotria, was called Saturnia from him.  He
first gave you the art of writing, and a stamped coinage, and thence it
is he presides over the public treasury.  But if Saturn were a man, he
had undoubtedly a human origin; and having a human origin, he was not
the offspring of heaven and earth. As his parents were unknown, it was
not unnatural that he should be spoken of as the son of those elements
from which we might all seem to spring. For who does not speak of heaven
and earth as father and mother, in a sort of way of veneration and
honour? or from the custom which prevails among us of saying that
persons of whom we have no knowledge, or who make a sudden appearance,
have fallen from the skies? In this way it came about that Saturn,
everywhere a sudden and unlooked-for guest, got everywhere the name of
the Heaven-born.  For even the common folk call persons whose stock is
unknown, sons of earth. I say nothing of how men in these rude times
were wont to act, when they were impressed by the look of any stranger
happening to appear among them, as though it were divine, since even at
this day men of culture make gods of those whom, a day or two before,
they acknowledged to be dead men by their public mourning for them. Let
these notices of Saturn, brief as they are, suffice. It will thus also
be proved that Jupiter is as certainly a man, as from a man he sprung;
and that one after another the whole swarm is mortal like the primal
stock.
