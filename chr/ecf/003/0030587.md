<span id="v.viii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Some Considerations in Reply
Eulogistic of the Flesh. It Was Created by God. The Body of Man Was, in
Fact, Previous to His Soul.</span>

<span id="v.viii.v-p2"></span>Inasmuch as all uneducated men, therefore,
still form their opinions after these common-sense views, and as the
falterers and the weak-minded have a renewal of their perplexities
occasioned by the selfsame views; and as the first battering-ram which
is directed against ourselves is that which shatters the condition of
the flesh, we must on our side necessarily so manage our defences, as to
guard, first of all, the condition of the flesh, their disparagement of
it being repulsed by our own eulogy. The heretics, therefore, challenged
us to use our rhetoric no less than our philosophy. Respecting, then,
this frail and poor, worthless body, which they do not indeed hesitate
to call evil, even if it had been the work of angels, as Menander and
Marcus are pleased to think, or the formation of some fiery being, an
angel, as Apelles teaches, it would be quite enough for securing respect
for the body, that it had the support and protection of even a secondary
deity.  The angels, we know, rank next to God.  Now, whatever be the
supreme God of each heretic, I should not unfairly derive the dignity of
the flesh likewise from Him to whom was present the will for its
production. For, of course, if He had not willed its production, He
would have prohibited it, when He knew it was in progress. It follows,
then, that even on their principle the flesh is equally the work of God.
There is no work but belongs to Him who has permitted it to exist. It is
indeed a happy circumstance, that most of their doctrines, including
even the harshest, accord to our God the entire formation of man.  How
mighty He is, you know full well who believe that He is the only God.
Let, then, the flesh begin to give you pleasure, since the Creator
thereof is so great. But, you say, even the world is the work of God,
and yet “the fashion of this <span id="page_549">p. 549</span> <span
id="v.viii.v-Page_549"></span>world passeth away,” <span
id="fr_7315"></span>[7316](#fn_7315.md) as the apostle himself testifies;
nor must it be predetermined that the world will be restored, simply
because it is the work of God. And surely if the universe, after its
ruin, is not to be formed again, why should a portion of it be? You are
right, if a portion is on an equality with the whole. But we maintain
that there is a difference. In the first place, because all things were
made by the Word of God, and without Him was nothing made. <span
id="fr_7316"></span>[7317](#fn_7316.md) Now the flesh, too, had its
existence from the Word of God, because of the principle, <span
id="fr_7317"></span>[7318](#fn_7317.md) that here should be nothing without
that Word.  “Let us make man,” <span
id="fr_7318"></span>[7319](#fn_7318.md) said He, before He created him, and
added, “with our hand,” for the sake of his pre-eminence, that so he
might not be compared with the rest of creation. <span
id="fr_7319"></span>[7320](#fn_7319) And “God,” says (the Scripture.md),
“formed man.” <span id="fr_7320"></span>[7321](#fn_7320.md) There is
undoubtedly a great difference in the procedure, springing of course
from the nature of the case. For the creatures which were made were
inferior to him for whom they were made; and they were made for man, to
whom they were afterwards made subject by God.  Rightly, therefore, had
the creatures which were thus intended for subjection, come forth into
being at the bidding and command and sole power of the *divine* voice;
whilst man, on the contrary, destined to be their lord, was formed by
God Himself, to the intent that he might be able to exercise his
mastery, being created by the Master *the Lord Himself*. Remember, too,
that man is properly called *flesh*, which had a prior occupation in
man’s designation: “And God formed man the clay of the ground.” <span
id="fr_7321"></span>[7322](#fn_7321.md) He now became man, who was hitherto
clay. “And He breathed upon his face the breath of life, and man (that
is, the clay) became a living soul; and God placed the man whom He had
formed in the garden.” <span id="fr_7322"></span>[7323](#fn_7322.md) So
that man was clay at first, and only afterwards *man* entire. I wish to
impress this on your attention, with a view to your knowing, that
whatever God has at all purposed or promised to man, is due not to the
soul simply, but to the flesh also; if not arising out of any community
in their origin, yet at all events by the privilege *possessed by the
latter* in its name. <span id="fr_7323"></span>[7324](#fn_7323.md)
