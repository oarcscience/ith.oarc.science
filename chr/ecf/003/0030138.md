<span id="iv.vii.vi-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vi-p5.1"></span>Scapula</span> was Proconsul of Carthage, and
though its date is conjectural (<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vi-p5.3"></span>a.d.</span> 217), this work gives valuable
*indices* of its time and circumstances. It was composed after the death
of Severus, to whom there is an allusion in chapter iv., after the
destruction of Byzantium (<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vi-p5.5"></span>a.d.</span> 196), to which there is a
reference in chapter iii.; and Dr. Allix suggests, after the dark day of
Utica (<span class="sc"><span id="iv.vii.vi-p5.6"></span>a.d.</span>
210) which he supposes to be referred to in the same chapter. Cincius
Severus, who is mentioned in chapter iv., was put to death by Severus,
<span class="sc"><span id="iv.vii.vi-p5.7"></span>a.d.</span> 198.

<span id="iv.vii.vi-p6"></span><span class="c6"><span

<span id="iv.vii.vi-p7"></span>(Caractacus, cap. ii., note 2, p. 105.)

<span id="iv.vii.vi-p8"></span>Mr. Lewin (*St. Paul*, ii. 397), building
on the fascinating theory of Archdeacon Williams, thinks St. Paul’s
Claudia (*Qu. Gladys?*) may very well have been the daughter of Caradoc,
with whose noble character we are made acquainted by Tacitus. (Annals
xii. 36.) And Archdeacon Williams gives us very strong reason to believe
he was a Christian. He may very well have lived to behold the Coliseum
completed. What more natural then, in view of the cruelty against
Christians there exercised, for the expressions with which he is
credited? In this case his words contain an eloquent ambiguity, which
Christians would appreciate, and which may have been in our author’s
mind when he says—“quousque sæculum stabit.” To those who looked for the
Second Advent, daily, this did not mean what the heathen might suppose.

<span id="iv.vii.vi-p9"></span>Bede’s version of the speech (See Du
Cange, II., 407., ) is this: “Quandiu stabit Colyseus—stabit et Roma:
Quando cadet Colysevs—cadet et Roma: Quando cadet Roma—cadet et mundus.”
