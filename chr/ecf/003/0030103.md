id="iv.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.</span>

<span id="iv.v.xix-p2"></span>We shall now see how the Scriptures
condemn the amphitheatre. If we can maintain that it is right to indulge
in the cruel, and the impious, and the fierce, let us go there. If we
are what we are said to be, let us regale ourselves there with human
blood. It is good, no doubt, to have the guilty punished. Who but the
criminal himself will deny that? And yet the innocent can find no
pleasure in another’s sufferings:  he rather mourns that a brother has
sinned so heinously as to need a punishment so dreadful. But who is my
guarantee that it is always the guilty who are adjudged to the wild
beasts, or to some other doom, and that the guiltless never suffer from
the revenge of the judge, or the weakness of the defence, or the
pressure of the rack? How much better, then, is it for me to remain
ignorant of the punishment inflicted on the wicked, lest I am obliged to
know also of the good coming to untimely ends—if I may speak of goodness
in the case at all! At any rate, gladiators not chargeable with crime
are offered in sale for the games, that they may become the victims of
the public pleasure. Even in the case of those who are judicially
condemned to the amphitheatre, what a monstrous thing it is, that, in
undergoing their punishment, they, from some less serious delinquency,
advance to the criminality of manslayers! But I mean these remarks for
heathen. As to Christians, I shall not insult them by adding another
word as to the aversion with which they should regard this sort of
exhibition; though no one is more able than myself to set forth fully
the whole subject, unless it be one who is still in the habit <span
id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span id="iv.v.xix-Page_88"></span>of going to
the shows. I would rather withal be incomplete than set memory
a-working. <span id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364)
