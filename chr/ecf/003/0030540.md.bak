<span id="v.vi.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—An Extravagant Way of Accounting
for the Communication of the Spiritual Nature to Man. It Was Furtively
Managed by Achamoth, Through the Unconscious Agency of Her Son.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxv-p2"></span>In Achamoth, moreover, there was inherent
a certain property of a spiritual germ, of her mother Sophia’s
substance; and Achamoth herself had carefully severed off (the same
quality), and implanted it in her son the Demiurge, although he was
actually unconscious of it. It is for you to imagine <span
id="fr_6845"></span>[6846](#fn_6845.md) the industry of this clandestine
arrangement.  For to this end had she deposited and concealed (this
germ), that, whenever the Demiurge came to impart life to Adam by his
inbreathing, he might at the same time draw off from the vital
principle <span id="fr_6846"></span>[6847](#fn_6846.md) the spiritual seed,
and, as by a pipe, inject it into the clayey nature; in order that,
being then fecundated in the material body as in a womb, and having
fully grown there, it might be found fit for one day receiving the
perfect Word. <span id="fr_6847"></span>[6848](#fn_6847.md) When,
therefore, the Demiurge commits to Adam the transmission of his own
vital principle, <span id="fr_6848"></span>[6849](#fn_6848.md) the
spiritual man lay hid, *although* inserted by his breath, and at the
same time introduced into the body, because the Demiurge knew no more
about his mother’s seed than about herself. To this seed they give the
name of Ecclesia (*the Church*), the mirror of the church above, and the
perfection <span id="fr_6849"></span>[6850](#fn_6849.md) of man; tracing
this *perfection* from Achamoth, just as they do the animal nature from
the Demiurge, the clayey material of the body (they derive) from the
primordial substance, <span id="fr_6850"></span>[6851](#fn_6850.md) the
flesh from Matter. So that you have a new Geryon here, only a fourfold
(rather than a threefold) monster.
