id="iv.v.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.</span>

<span id="iv.v.xxv-p2"></span>Seated where there is nothing of God, will
one be thinking of his Maker? Will there be peace in his soul when there
is eager strife there for a charioteer?  Wrought up into a frenzied
excitement, will he learn to be modest? Nay, in the whole thing he will
meet with no greater temptation than that gay attiring of the men and
women. The very intermingling of emotions, the very agreements and
disagreements with each other in the bestowment of their favours, where
you have such close communion, blow up the sparks of passion. And then
there is scarce any other object in going to the show, but to see and to
be seen.  When a tragic actor is declaiming, will one be giving thought
to prophetic appeals? Amid the measures of the effeminate player, will
he call up to himself a psalm? And when the athletes are hard at
struggle, will he be ready to proclaim that there must be no striking
again? And with his eye fixed on the bites of bears, and the sponge-nets
of the net-fighters, can he be moved by compassion? May God avert from
His people any such passionate eagerness after a cruel enjoyment!  For
how monstrous it is to go from God’s church to the devil’s—from <span

the stye, <span id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md) as they say; to raise
your hands to God, and then to weary them in the applause of an actor;
out of the mouth, from which you uttered Amen over the Holy Thing, to
give witness in a gladiator’s favour; to cry “forever” to any one else
but God and Christ!
