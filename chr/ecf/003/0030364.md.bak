<span id="v.iv.iii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—The Marcionites Charged God
with Having Instigated the Hebrews to Spoil the Egyptians. Defence of
the Divine Dispensation in that Matter.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xx-p2"></span>But these “saucy cuttles” <span
id="fr_2943"></span>[2944](#fn_2943) (of heretics.md) <span
id="page_313">p. 313</span> <span id="v.iv.iii.xx-Page_313"></span>under
the figure of whom the law about things to be eaten <span
id="fr_2944"></span>[2945](#fn_2944.md) prohibited this very kind of
piscatory aliment, as soon as they find themselves confuted, eject the
black venom of their blasphemy, and so spread about in all directions
the object which (as is now plain) they severally have in view, when
they put forth such assertions and protestations as shall obscure and
tarnish the rekindled light <span id="fr_2945"></span>[2946](#fn_2945.md)
of the Creator’s bounty. We will, however, follow their wicked design,
even through these black clouds, and drag to light their tricks of dark
calumny, laying to the Creator’s charge with especial emphasis the fraud
and theft of gold and silver which the Hebrews were commanded by Him to
practise against the Egyptians. Come, unhappy heretic, I cite even you
as a witness; first look at the case of the two nations, and then you
will form a judgment of the Author of the command.  The Egyptians put in
a claim on the Hebrews for these gold and silver vessels. <span
id="fr_2946"></span>[2947](#fn_2946.md) The Hebrews assert a counter claim,
alleging that by the bond <span id="fr_2947"></span>[2948](#fn_2947.md) of
their respective fathers, attested by the written engagement of both
parties, there were due to them the arrears of that laborious slavery of
theirs, for the bricks they had so painfully made, and the cities and
palaces <span id="fr_2948"></span>[2949](#fn_2948.md) which they had built.
What shall be your verdict, you discoverer <span
id="fr_2949"></span>[2950](#fn_2949.md) of the most good God? That the
Hebrews must admit the fraud, or the Egyptians the compensation? For
they maintain that thus has the question been settled by the advocates
on both sides, <span id="fr_2950"></span>[2951](#fn_2950.md) of the
Egyptians demanding their vessels, and the Hebrews claiming the requital
of their labours. But for all they say, <span
id="fr_2951"></span>[2952](#fn_2951.md) the Egyptians justly renounced
their restitution-claim then and there; while the Hebrews to this day,
in spite of the Marcionites, re-assert their demand for even greater
damages, <span id="fr_2952"></span>[2953](#fn_2952.md) insisting that,
however large was their loan of the gold and silver, it would not be
compensation enough, even if the labour of six hundred thousand men
should be valued at only “a farthing” <span
id="fr_2953"></span>[2954](#fn_2953.md) a day a piece. Which, however, were
the more in number—those who claimed the vessel, or those who dwelt in
the palaces and cities? Which, too, the greater—the grievance of the
Egyptians against the Hebrews, or “the favour” <span
id="fr_2954"></span>[2955](#fn_2954.md) which they displayed towards them?
Were free men reduced to servile labour, in order that the Hebrews might
simply proceed against the Egyptians by action at law for injuries; or
in order that their officers might on their benches sit and exhibit
their backs and shoulders shamefully mangled by the fierce application
of the scourge? It was not by a few plates and cup—in all cases the
property, no doubt, of still fewer rich men—that any one would pronounce
that compensation should have been awarded to the Hebrews, but both by
all the resources of these and by the contributions of all the
people. <span id="fr_2955"></span>[2956](#fn_2955.md) If, therefore, the
case of the Hebrews be a good one, the Creator’s case must likewise be a
good one; that is to say, his command, when He both made the Egyptians
unconsciously grateful, and also gave His own people their discharge in
full <span id="fr_2956"></span>[2957](#fn_2956.md) at the time of their
migration by the scanty comfort of a tacit requital *of their long
servitude*. It was plainly less than their due which He commanded to be
exacted. The Egyptians ought to have given back their men-children <span
id="fr_2957"></span>[2958](#fn_2957.md) also to the Hebrews.

<span id="v.iv.iii.xx-p3"></span> *Sepiæ isti*.  Pliny, in his *Nat.
Hist*. ix. 29, says: “The males of the cuttles kind are spotted with
sundry colours more dark and blackish, yes, and more firme and steady,
than the female. If the female be smitted with the trout-speare, they
will come to succour her; but she again is not so kind to them: for if
the male be stricken, she will not stand to it, but runs away. But both
of them, if they perceive that they be taken in such streights that they
cannot escape, shed from them a certain black humor like to ink; and
when the water therewith is troubled and made duskish, therein they hide
themselves, and are no more seen” (Holland’s *Translation*, p. 250). Our
epithet “*saucy* cuttle” comes from Shakespeare, 2 *Henry* iv 2, 4,
where, however, the word seems employed in a different sense.

<span id="v.iv.iii.xx-p10"></span> For a discussion of the spoiling of
the Egyptians by the Israelites, the reader is referred to Calmet’s
*Commentary*, on [Ex. iii. 22](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.iv.iii.xx-p10.1"></span>, where he adduces, besides this passage
of Tertullian, the opinions of Irenæus, *adv. Hæres*. iv. 49; Augustine,
*contra Faust*. ii. 71; Theodoret, *Quæst. in Exod*. xxiii.; Clement of
Alex. *Stromat*. i. 1; of Philo, *De Vita Moysis*, i.; Josephus,
*Antiqq*. ii. 8, who says that “the Egyptians freely gave all to the
Israelites;” of Melchior Canus, *Loc. Theoll*. i. 4. He also refers to
the book of Wisdom, x. 17–20. These all substantially agree with our
author. See also a full discussion in Selden, *De Jure Nat. et Gentium*,
vii. 8, who quotes from the Gemara, *Sanhedrin*, c. ii. f. 91a; and
*Bereshith Rabba*, par. 61 f., 68, col. 2, where such a tribunal as
Tertullian refers to is mentioned as convened by Alexander the Great,
who, after hearing the pleadings, gave his assent to the claims of the
advocates of Israel.
