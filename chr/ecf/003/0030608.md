<span id="v.viii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—Even the Metaphorical
Descriptions of This Subject in the Scriptures Point to the Bodily
Resurrection, the Only Sense Which Secures Their Consistency and
Dignity.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxvi-p2"></span>To a preceding objection, that the
Scriptures are allegorical, I have still one answer to make—that it is
open to us also to defend the bodily character of the resurrection by
means of the language of the prophets, which is equally figurative. For
consider that primeval sentence which God spake when He called man
*earth*; saying, “Earth thou art, and to earth shalt thou return.” <span
id="fr_7460"></span>[7461](#fn_7460) In respect, of course, <span
id="page_564">p. 564</span> <span id="v.viii.xxvi-Page_564"></span>to
his fleshly substance, which had been taken out of the ground, and which
was the first to receive the name of man, as we have already
shown, <span id="fr_7461"></span>[7462](#fn_7461) does not this passage
give one instruction to interpret in relation to the *flesh* also
whatever of wrath or of grace God has determined for the earth, because,
strictly speaking, the earth is not exposed to His judgment, since it
has never done any good or evil? “Cursed,” no doubt, it was, for it
drank the blood *of man*; <span id="fr_7462"></span>[7463](#fn_7462) but
even this was as a figure of homicidal flesh. For if the earth has to
suffer either joy or injury, it is simply on man’s account, that *he*
may suffer the joy or the sorrow through the events which happen to his
dwelling-place, whereby he will rather have to pay the penalty which,
simply on his account, even the earth must suffer.  When, therefore, God
even threatens the earth, I would prefer saying that He threatens the
flesh: so likewise, when He makes a promise to the earth, I would rather
understand Him as promising the flesh; as in that passage of David: “The
Lord is King, let the earth be glad,” <span
id="fr_7463"></span>[7464](#fn_7463) —meaning the flesh of the saints,
to which appertains the enjoyment of the kingdom of God. Then he
afterwards says: “The earth saw and trembled; the mountains melted like
wax at the presence of the Lord,”—meaning, no doubt the flesh of the
wicked; and (in a similar sense) it is written: “For they shall look on
Him whom they pierced.” <span id="fr_7464"></span>[7465](#fn_7464) If
indeed it will be thought that both these passages were pronounced
simply of the element earth, how can it be consistent that it should
shake and melt at the presence of the Lord, at whose royal dignity it
before exulted? So again in Isaiah, “Ye shall eat the good of the
land,” <span id="fr_7465"></span>[7466](#fn_7465) the expression means
the blessings which await the flesh when in the kingdom of God it shall
be renewed, and made like the angels, and waiting to obtain the things
“which neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, and which have not entered
into the heart of man.” <span id="fr_7466"></span>[7467](#fn_7466)
Otherwise, how vain that God should invite men to obedience by the
fruits of the field and the elements of this life, when He dispenses
these to even irreligious men and blasphemers; on a general condition
once for all made to man, “sending rain on the good and on the evil, and
making His sun to shine on the just and on the unjust!” <span
id="fr_7467"></span>[7468](#fn_7467) Happy, no doubt, is faith, if it is
to obtain gifts which the enemies of God and Christ not only use, but
even abuse, “worshipping the creature itself in opposition to the
Creator!” <span id="fr_7468"></span>[7469](#fn_7468) You will reckon, (I
suppose) onions and truffles among earth’s bounties, since the Lord
declares that “man shall not live on bread alone!” <span
id="fr_7469"></span>[7470](#fn_7469) In this way the Jews lose heavenly
blessings, by confining their hopes to earthly ones, being ignorant of
the promise of heavenly bread, and of the oil of God’s unction, and the
wine of the Spirit, and of that water of life which has its vigour from
the vine of Christ. On exactly the same principle, they consider the
special soil of Judæa to be that very holy land, which ought rather to
be interpreted of the Lord’s flesh, which, in all those who put on
Christ, is thenceforward the holy land; holy indeed by the indwelling of
the Holy Ghost, truly flowing with milk and honey by the sweetness of
His assurance, truly Judæan by reason of the friendship of God.  For “he
is not a Jew which is one outwardly, but he who is one inwardly.” <span
id="fr_7470"></span>[7471](#fn_7470) In the same way it is that both
God’s temple and Jerusalem (must be understood) when it is said by
Isaiah: “Awake, awake, O Jerusalem! put on the strength of thine arm;
awake, as in thine earliest time,” <span
id="fr_7471"></span>[7472](#fn_7471) that is to say, in that innocence
which preceded the fall into sin. For how can words of this kind of
exhortation and invitation be suitable for that Jerusalem which killed
the prophets, and stoned those that were sent to them, and at last
crucified its very Lord? Neither indeed is salvation promised to any one
land at all, which must needs pass away with the fashion of the whole
world. Even if anybody should venture strongly to contend that paradise
is the holy land, which it may be possible to designate as the land of
our first parents Adam and Eve, it will even then follow that the
restoration of paradise will seem to be promised to the flesh, whose lot
it was to inhabit and keep it, in order that man may be recalled thereto
just such as he was driven from it.
