<span id="v.viii.xlix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIX.—The Same Subject Continued.
What Does the Apostle Exclude from the Dead?  Certainly Not the
Substance of the Flesh.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xlix-p2"></span>We come now to the very gist <span
id="fr_7637"></span>[7638](#fn_7637) of the whole question: What are the
substances, and of what nature are they, which the apostle has
disinherited of the kingdom of God? The preceding statements give us a
clue to this point also.  He says: “The first man is of the earth,
earthy”—that is, made of dust, that is, Adam; “the second man is from
heaven” <span id="fr_7638"></span>[7639](#fn_7638) —that is, the Word of
God, which is Christ, in no other way, however, *man* (although “from
heaven”), than as being Himself flesh and soul, just as a human being
is, just as Adam was. Indeed, in a previous passage He is called “the
second Adam,” <span id="fr_7639"></span>[7640](#fn_7639) deriving the
identity of His name from His participation in the substance, because
not even Adam was flesh of human seed, in which Christ is also like
Him. <span id="fr_7640"></span>[7641](#fn_7640) “As is the earthy, such
are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they
also that are heavenly.” <span id="fr_7641"></span>[7642](#fn_7641)
*Such* (does he mean), in substance; or first of all in training, and
afterwards in the dignity and worth which that training aimed at
acquiring? Not in substance, however, by any means will the earthy and
the heavenly be separated, designated as they have been by the apostle
once for all, as *men*. For even if Christ were the only true
“heavenly,” nay, super-celestial Being, He is still man, as composed of
body and soul; and in no respect is He separated from the quality of
“earthiness,” owing to that condition of His which makes Him a partaker
of both substances. In like manner, those also who after Him are
heavenly, are understood to have this celestial quality predicated of
them not from their present nature, but from their future glory; because
in a preceding sentence, which originated this distinction respecting
difference of dignity, there was shown to be “one glory in celestial
bodies, and another in terrestrial ones,” <span
id="fr_7642"></span>[7643](#fn_7642) —“one glory of the sun, and another
glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for even one star
differeth from another star in glory,” <span
id="fr_7643"></span>[7644](#fn_7643) although not in substance. Then,
after having thus premised the difference in that worth or dignity which
is even now to be aimed at, and then at last to be enjoyed, the apostle
adds an exhortation, that we should both here in our training follow the
example of Christ, and there attain His eminence in glory:  “As we have
borne the image of the earthy, let us also bear the image of the
heavenly.” <span id="fr_7644"></span>[7645](#fn_7644) We have indeed
borne the image of the earthy, by our sharing in his transgression, by
our participation in his death, by our banishment from Paradise. Now,
although the image of Adam is here borne by is in the flesh, yet we are
not exhorted to put off the flesh; but if not the flesh, it is the
conversation, in order that we may then bear the image of the heavenly
in ourselves,—no longer indeed *the image* of God, and no longer *the
image* of a Being whose state is in heaven; but after the lineaments of
Christ, by our walking here in holiness, righteousness, and <span
id="page_583">p. 583</span> <span
id="v.viii.xlix-Page_583"></span>truth.  And so wholly intent on the
inculcation of moral conduct is he throughout this passage, that he
tells us we ought to bear the image of Christ in this flesh of ours, and
in this period of instruction and discipline. For when he says “*let us
bear*” in the imperative mood, he suits his words to the present life,
in which man exists in no other substance than as flesh and soul; or if
it is another, even the heavenly, substance to which this faith (of
ours) looks forward, yet the promise is made to that *substance* to
which the injunction is given to labour earnestly to merit its reward.
Since, therefore, he makes the image both of the earthy and the heavenly
consist of moral conduct—the one to be abjured, and the other to be
pursued—and then consistently adds, “For this I say” (on account, that
is, of what I have already said, because the conjunction “*for*”
connects what follows with the preceding words) “that flesh and blood
cannot inherit the kingdom of God,” <span
id="fr_7645"></span>[7646](#fn_7645) —he means the flesh and blood to be
understood in no other sense than the before-mentioned “image of the
earthy;” and since this is reckoned to consist in “the old
conversation,” <span id="fr_7646"></span>[7647](#fn_7646) which old
conversation receives not the kingdom of God, therefore flesh and blood,
by not receiving the kingdom of God, are reduced to the *life of the*
old conversation. Of course, as the apostle has never put the substance
for the works *of man*, he cannot use such a construction here.  Since,
however he has declared of men which are yet alive in the flesh, that
they “are not in the flesh,” <span id="fr_7647"></span>[7648](#fn_7647)
meaning that they are not living in the works of the flesh, you ought
not to subvert its form nor its substance, but only the works done in
the substance (of the flesh), alienating us from the kingdom of God. It
is after displaying to the Galatians these pernicious works that he
professes to warn them beforehand, even as he had “told them in time
past, that they which do such things should not inherit the kingdom of
God,” <span id="fr_7648"></span>[7649](#fn_7648) even because they bore
not the image of the heavenly, as they had borne the image of the
earthy; and so, in consequence of their old conversation, they were to
be regarded as nothing else than flesh and blood. But even if the
apostle had abruptly thrown out the sentence that flesh and blood must
be excluded from the kingdom of God, without any previous intimation of
his meaning, would it not have been equally our duty to interpret these
two substances as the old man abandoned to mere flesh and blood—in other
words, to eating and drinking, one feature of which would be to speak
against the faith of the resurrection: “Let us eat and drink, for
to-morrow we die.” <span id="fr_7649"></span>[7650](#fn_7649) Now, when
the apostle parenthetically inserted this, he censured flesh and blood
because of their enjoyment in eating and drinking.
