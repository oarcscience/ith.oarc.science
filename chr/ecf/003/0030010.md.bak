<span id="iv.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p2"></span>And so, having made these remarks as it
were by way of preface, that I might show in its true colours the
injustice of the public hatred against us, I shall now take my stand on
the plea of our blamelessness; and I shall not only refute the things
which are objected <span id="page_21">p. 21</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iv-Page_21"></span>to us, but I shall also retort them on the
objectors, that in this way all may know that Christians are free from
the very crimes they are so well aware prevail among themselves, that
they may at the same time be put to the blush for their accusations
against us,—accusations I shall not say of the worst of men against the
best, but now, as they will have it, against those who are only their
fellows in sin. We shall reply to the accusation of all the various
crimes we are said to be guilty of in secret, such as we find them
committing in the light of day, and as being guilty of which we are held
to be wicked, senseless, worthy of punishment, deserving of ridicule.
But since, when our truth meets you successfully at all points, the
authority of the laws as a last resort is set up against it, so that it
is either said that their determinations are absolutely conclusive, or
the necessity of obedience is, however unwillingly, preferred to the
truth, I shall first, in this matter of the laws grapple with you as
with their chosen protectors. Now first, when you sternly lay it down in
your sentences, “It is not lawful for you to exist,” and with
unhesitating rigour you enjoin this to be carried out, you exhibit the
violence and unjust domination of mere tyranny, if you deny the thing to
be lawful, simply on the ground that you wish it to be unlawful, not
because it ought to be. But if you would have it unlawful because it
*ought* not to be lawful, without doubt that should have no permission
of law which does harm; and on this ground, in fact, it is already
determined that whatever is beneficial is legitimate. Well, if I have
found what your law prohibits to be good, as one who has arrived at such
a previous opinion, has it not lost its power to debar me from it,
though that very thing, if it were evil, it would justly forbid to me?
If your law has gone wrong, it is of human origin, I think; it has not
fallen from heaven. Is it wonderful that man should err in making a law,
or come to his senses in rejecting it? Did not the Lacedæmonians amend
the laws of Lycurgus himself, thereby inflicting such pain on their
author that he shut himself up, and doomed himself to death by
starvation? Are you not yourselves every day, in your efforts to
illumine the darkness of antiquity, cutting and hewing with the new axes
of imperial rescripts and edicts, that whole ancient and rugged forest
of your laws? Has not Severus, that most resolute of rulers, but
yesterday repealed the ridiculous Papian laws <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) which compelled people to have children
before the Julian laws allow matrimony to be contracted, and that though
they have the authority of age upon their side? There were laws, too, in
old times, that parties against whom a decision had been given might be
cut in pieces by their creditors; however, by common consent that
cruelty was afterwards erased from the statutes, and the capital penalty
turned into a brand of shame. By adopting the plan of confiscating a
debtor’s goods, it was sought rather to pour the blood in blushes over
his face than to pour it out.  How many laws lie hidden out of sight
which still require to be reformed! For it is neither the number of
their years nor the dignity of their maker that commends them, but
simply that they are just; and therefore, when their injustice is
recognized, they are deservedly condemned, even though they condemn. 
Why speak we of them as unjust? nay, if they punish mere names, we may
well call them irrational. But if they punish acts, why in our case do
they punish acts solely on the ground of a name, while in others they
must have them proved not from the name, but from the wrong done? I am a
practiser of incest (so they say); why do they not inquire into it? I am
an infant-killer; why do they not apply the torture to get from me the
truth? I am guilty of crimes against the gods, against the Cæsars; why
am I, who am able to clear myself, not allowed to be heard on my own
behalf? No law forbids the sifting of the crimes which it prohibits, for
a judge never inflicts a righteous vengeance if he is not well assured
that a crime has been committed; nor does a citizen render a true
subjection to the law, if he does not know the nature of the thing on
which the punishment is inflicted. It is not enough that a law is just,
nor that the judge should be convinced of its justice; those from whom
obedience is expected should have that conviction too. Nay, a law lies
under strong suspicions which does not care to have itself tried and
approved: it is a positively wicked law, if, unproved, it tyrannizes
over men.
