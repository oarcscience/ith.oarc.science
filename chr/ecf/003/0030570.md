<span id="v.vii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The Valentinian Figment of
Christ’s Flesh Being of a Spiritual Nature, Examined and Refuted Out of
Scripture.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xv-p2"></span>Valentinus, indeed, on the strength of his
heretical system, might consistently devise a spiritual flesh for
Christ. Any one who refused to believe that that flesh was human might
pretend it to be anything he liked, forasmuch as (and this remark is
applicable to all *heretics*), if it was not human, and was not born of
man, I do not see of what substance Christ Himself spoke when He called
Himself man and the Son of man, *saying*: “But now ye seek to kill me, a
man that hath told you the truth;” <span
id="fr_7148"></span>[7149](#fn_7148) and “The Son of man is Lord of the
Sabbath-day.” <span id="fr_7149"></span>[7150](#fn_7149) For it is of
Him that Isaiah writes: “A man of suffering, and acquainted with the
bearing of weakness;” <span id="fr_7150"></span>[7151](#fn_7150) and
Jeremiah: “He is a man, and who hath known Him?” <span
id="fr_7151"></span>[7152](#fn_7151) and Daniel: “Upon the clouds (He
came) as the Son of man.” <span id="fr_7152"></span>[7153](#fn_7152) The
Apostle Paul likewise says: “The man Christ Jesus is the one Mediator
between God and man.” <span id="fr_7153"></span>[7154](#fn_7153) Also
Peter, in the Acts of the Apostles, speaks of Him as verily human (when
he says), “Jesus Christ was a man approved of God among you.” <span
id="fr_7154"></span>[7155](#fn_7154) These passages alone ought to
suffice as a prescriptive <span id="fr_7155"></span>[7156](#fn_7155)
testimony in proof that Christ had human flesh derived from man, and not
spiritual, and that His flesh was not composed of soul, <span
id="fr_7156"></span>[7157](#fn_7156) nor of stellar substance, and that
it was not an imaginary flesh; (and no doubt they would be sufficient)
if heretics could only divest themselves of all their contentious warmth
and artifice. For, as I have read in some writer of Valentinus’ wretched
faction, <span id="fr_7157"></span>[7158](#fn_7157) they refuse at the
outset to believe that a human and earthly substance was created <span
id="fr_7158"></span>[7159](#fn_7158) for Christ, lest the Lord should be
regarded as inferior to the angels, who are not formed of earthly flesh;
whence, too, it would be <span id="page_535">p. 535</span> <span
id="v.vii.xv-Page_535"></span>necessary that, if His flesh were like
ours, it should be similarly born, not of the Spirit, nor of God, but of
the will of man. Why, moreover, should it be born, not of corruptible
\[seed\], but of incorruptible? Why, again, since His flesh has both
risen and returned to heaven, is not ours, being like His, also taken up
at once? Or else, why does not His flesh, since it is like ours, return
in like manner to the ground, and suffer dissolution? Such objections
even the heathen used constantly to bandy about. <span
id="fr_7159"></span>[7160](#fn_7159) Was the Son of God reduced to such
a depth of degradation? Again, if He rose again as a precedent for our
hope, how is it that nothing like it has been thought desirable (to
happen) to ourselves? <span id="fr_7160"></span>[7161](#fn_7160) Such
views are not improper for heathens and they are fit and natural for the
heretics too.  For, indeed, what difference is there between them,
except it be that the heathen, in not believing, do believe; while the
heretics, in believing, do not believe? Then, again, they read: “Thou
madest Him a little less than angels;” <span
id="fr_7161"></span>[7162](#fn_7161) and they deny the lower nature of
that Christ who declares Himself to be, “not a man, but a worm;” <span
id="fr_7162"></span>[7163](#fn_7162) who also had “no form nor
comeliness, but His form was ignoble, despised more than all men, a man
in suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of weakness.” <span
id="fr_7163"></span>[7164](#fn_7163) Here they discover a human being
mingled with a divine one and so they deny the manhood.  They believe
that He died, and maintain that a being which has died was born of an
incorruptible substance; <span id="fr_7164"></span>[7165](#fn_7164) as
if, forsooth, corruptibility <span id="fr_7165"></span>[7166](#fn_7165)
were something else than death! But our flesh, too, ought immediately to
have risen again. Wait a while.  Christ has not yet subdued His enemies,
so as to be able to triumph over them in company with His friends.
