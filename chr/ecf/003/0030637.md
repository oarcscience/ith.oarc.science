<span id="v.viii.lv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LV.—The Change of a Thing’s Condition
is Not the Destruction of Its Substance. The Application of This
Principle to Our Subject.</span>

<span id="v.viii.lv-p2"></span>Now although, in proving that the flesh
shall rise again we *ipso facto* prove that no other *flesh* will
partake of that resurrection than that which is in question, yet
insulated questions and their occasions do require even discussions of
their own, even if they have been already sufficiently met. We will
therefore give a fuller explanation of the force and the reason of a
change which (is so great, that it) almost suggests the presumption that
it is a different flesh which is to rise again; as if, indeed, so great
a change amounted to utter cessation, and a complete destruction of the
former self. A distinction, however, must be made between a *change*,
however great, and everything which has the character of *destruction*.
For undergoing change is one thing, but being destroyed is another
thing. Now this distinction would no longer exist, if the flesh were to
suffer such a change as amounts to destruction. Destroyed, however, it
must be by the change, unless it shall itself persistently remain
throughout the altered condition which shall be exhibited in the
resurrection. For precisely as it perishes, if it does not rise again,
so also does it equally perish even if it does rise again, on the
supposition that it is lost <span id="fr_7704"></span>[7705](#fn_7704)
in the change. It will as much fail of a future existence, as if it did
not rise again at all. And how absurd is it to rise again for the
purpose of not having a being, when it had it in its power not to rise
again, and so lose its being—because it had already begun its
non-existence! Now, things which are absolutely different, as mutation
and destruction are, will not admit of mixture and confusion; in their
operations, too, they differ. One destroys, the other changes.
Therefore, as that which is destroyed is not changed, so that which is
changed is not destroyed. To perish is altogether to cease to be what a
thing once was, whereas to be changed is to exist in another condition.
Now, if a thing exists in another condition, it can still be the same
thing itself; for since it does not perish, it has its existence still.
A change, indeed, it has experienced, but not a destruction. A thing may
undergo a complete change, and yet remain still the same thing. In like
manner, a man also may be quite himself in substance even in the present
life, and for all that undergo various changes—in habit, in bodily bulk,
in health, in condition, in dignity, and in age—in taste, business,
means, houses, laws and customs—and still lose nothing of his human
nature, nor so to be made another man as to cease to be the same;
indeed, I ought hardly to say another man, but another thing. This form
of change even the Holy Scriptures give us instances of. The hand of
Moses is changed, and it becomes like a dead one, bloodless, colourless,
and stiff with cold; but on the recovery of heat, and on the restoration
of its natural colour, it is again the same flesh and blood. <span
id="fr_7705"></span>[7706](#fn_7705) Afterwards the face of the same
Moses is changed, <span id="fr_7706"></span>[7707](#fn_7706) with a
brightness which eye could not bear.  But he was Moses still, even when
he was not visible. So also Stephen had already put on the appearance of
an angel, <span id="fr_7707"></span>[7708](#fn_7707) although they were
none other <span id="page_589">p. 589</span> <span
id="v.viii.lv-Page_589"></span>than his human knees <span
id="fr_7708"></span>[7709](#fn_7708) which bent beneath the stoning. The
Lord, again, in the retirement of the mount, had changed His raiment for
a robe of light; but He still retained features which Peter could
recognise. <span id="fr_7709"></span>[7710](#fn_7709) In that same scene
Moses also and Elias gave proof that the same condition of bodily
existence may continue even in glory—the one in the likeness of a flesh
which he had not yet recovered, the other in the reality of one which he
had not yet put off. <span id="fr_7710"></span>[7711](#fn_7710) It was
as full of this splendid example that Paul said: “Who shall change our
vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.” <span
id="fr_7711"></span>[7712](#fn_7711) But if you maintain that a
transfiguration and a conversion amounts to the annihilation of any
substance, then it follows that “Saul, when changed into another
man,” <span id="fr_7712"></span>[7713](#fn_7712) passed away from his
own bodily substance; and that Satan himself, when “transformed into an
angel of light,” <span id="fr_7713"></span>[7714](#fn_7713) loses his
own proper character. Such is not my opinion. So likewise changes,
conversions and reformations will necessarily take place to bring about
the resurrection, but the substance *of the flesh* will still be
preserved safe.
