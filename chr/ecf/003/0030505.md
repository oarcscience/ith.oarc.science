<span id="v.v.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—Other Absurd Theories
Respecting Matter and Its Incidents Exposed in an Ironical Strain.
Motion in Matter. Hermogenes’ Conceits Respecting It.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxxvi-p2"></span>But see what a contradiction he next
advances <span id="fr_6509"></span>[6510](#fn_6509.md) (or perhaps some
*other* reason <span id="fr_6510"></span>[6511](#fn_6510.md) occurs to
him), when he declares that Matter partly corporeal and partly
incorporeal. Then must Matter be considered (to embrace) both
conditions, in order that it may not have either? For it will be
corporeal, and incorporeal in spite of <span
id="fr_6511"></span>[6512](#fn_6511.md) the declaration of that
antithesis, <span id="fr_6512"></span>[6513](#fn_6512.md) which is plainly
above giving any <span id="page_498">p. 498</span> <span
id="v.v.xxxvi-Page_498"></span>reason for its opinion, just as that
“other reason” also was. Now, by the corporeal part of Matter, he means
that of which bodies are created; but by the incorporeal part *of
Matter*, he means its uncreated <span
id="fr_6513"></span>[6514](#fn_6513.md) motion. If, says he, *Matter* were
simply a body, there would appear to be in it nothing incorporeal, that
is, (no) motion; if, on the other hand, it had been wholly incorporeal
no body could be formed out of it. What a peculiarly right <span
id="fr_6514"></span>[6515](#fn_6514.md) reason have we here! Only if you
make your sketches as right as you make your reason, Hermogenes, no
painter would be more stupid <span id="fr_6515"></span>[6516](#fn_6515.md)
than yourself. For who is going to allow you to reckon *motion* as a
moiety of *Matter*, seeing that it is not a substantial thing, because
it is not corporeal, but an accident (if indeed it be even that) of a
substance and a body?  Just as action <span
id="fr_6516"></span>[6517](#fn_6516.md) is, and impulsion, just as a slip
is, or a fall, so is motion. When anything moves even of itself, its
motion is the result of impulse; <span
id="fr_6517"></span>[6518](#fn_6517.md) but certainly it is no part of its
substance in your sense, <span id="fr_6518"></span>[6519](#fn_6518.md) when
you make motion the incorporeal part of matter. All things,
indeed, <span id="fr_6519"></span>[6520](#fn_6519.md) have motion—either of
themselves as animals, or of others as inanimate things; but yet we
should not say that either a man or a stone was both corporeal and
incorporeal because they had both a body and motion: *we should say*
rather that all things have one form of simple <span
id="fr_6520"></span>[6521](#fn_6520.md) corporeality, which is the
essential quality <span id="fr_6521"></span>[6522](#fn_6521.md) of
substance. If any incorporeal *incidents* accrue to them, as actions, or
passions, or functions, <span id="fr_6522"></span>[6523](#fn_6522.md) or
desires, we do not reckon these parts as of the things. How then does he
contrive to assign an *integral* portion of Matter to *motion*, which
does not pertain to substance, but to a certain condition <span
id="fr_6523"></span>[6524](#fn_6523.md) of substance? Is not this
incontrovertible? <span id="fr_6524"></span>[6525](#fn_6524.md) Suppose you
had taken it into your head <span id="fr_6525"></span>[6526](#fn_6525.md)
to represent matter as immoveable, would then the immobility seem to you
to be a moiety of its form? *Certainly not*. Neither, in like manner,
could motion. But I shall be at liberty to speak of motion
elsewhere. <span id="fr_6526"></span>[6527](#fn_6526.md)

<span id="v.v.xxxvi-p6"></span> The original, “Adversus renuntiationem
reciprocationis illius,” is an obscure expression. Oehler, who gives
this reading in his edition, after the *editio princeps*, renders the
term “reciprocationis” by the phrase “negative conversion” of the
proposition that Matter is corporeal and incorporeal (*q.d.* “Matter is
neither corporeal nor incorporeal”). Instead, however, of the reading
“reciprocationis,” Oehler would gladly read “rectæ rationis,” after most
of the editions.  He thinks that this allusion to “the right reason,” of
which Hermogenes boasted, and of which the absurd conclusion is exposed
in the context, very well suits the sarcastic style of Tertullian.  If
this, the general reading, be adopted, we must render the whole clause
this: “For it will be corporeal and incorporeal, in spite of the
declaration of that *right reason* (of Hermogenes), which is plainly
enough above giving any reason,” etc. etc.

impossible to translate this word *irregular* as it has been proposed to
do by Genoude.
