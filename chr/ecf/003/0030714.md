<span id="vi.ii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Baptism Not to Be Presumptously
Received. It Requires Preceding Repentance, Manifested by Amendment of
Life.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p2"></span>Whatever, then, our poor ability has
attempted to suggest with reference to laying hold of repentance once
for all, and perpetually retaining it, does indeed bear upon *all* who
are given up to the Lord, as being all competitors for salvation in
earning the favour of God; but is chiefly urgent in the case of those
young novices who are only just beginning to bedew <span
id="fr_8463"></span>[8464](#fn_8463.md) their ears with divine discourses,
and who, as whelps in yet early infancy, and with eyes not yet perfect,
creep about uncertainly, and say indeed that they renounce their former
deed, and assume (the profession of) repentance, but neglect to complete
it. <span id="fr_8464"></span>[8465](#fn_8464.md) For the very end of
desiring importunes them to desire somewhat of their former *deeds*;
just as fruits, when they are already beginning to turn into the
sourness or bitterness of age, do yet still in some part flatter <span
id="fr_8465"></span>[8466](#fn_8465.md) their own loveliness. Moreover, a
presumptuous confidence in baptism introduces all kind of vicious delay
and tergiversation with regard to repentance; for, feeling sure of
undoubted pardon of their sins, *men* meanwhile steal the intervening
time, and make it for themselves into a holiday-time <span
id="fr_8466"></span>[8467](#fn_8466.md) for sinning, rather than a time for
learning not to sin. Further, how inconsistent is it to expect pardon of
sins (to be granted) to a repentance which they have not fulfilled! This
is to hold out your hand for merchandise, but not produce the price. 
For repentance is the price at which the Lord has determined to award
pardon: He proposes the redemption <span
id="fr_8467"></span>[8468](#fn_8467.md) of release from penalty at this
compensating exchange of repentance. If, then, sellers first examine the
coin with which they make their bargains, to see whether it be cut, or
scraped, or adulterated, <span id="fr_8468"></span>[8469](#fn_8468.md) we
believe likewise that the Lord, when about to make us the grant of so
costly merchandise, even of eternal life, first institutes a probation
of our repentance. “But meanwhile let us defer the reality of our
repentance: it will then, I suppose, be clear that we are amended when
we are absolved.” <span id="fr_8469"></span>[8470](#fn_8469.md) By no
means; (but our amendment should be manifested) while, pardon being in
abeyance, there is still a prospect of penalty; while *the penitent*
does not yet merit—so far as merit we can—his liberation; while God is
threatening, not while He is forgiving. For what slave, after his
position has been changed by reception of freedom, charges himself with
his (past) thefts and desertions?  What soldier, after his discharge,
makes satisfaction for his (former) brands? A sinner is bound to bemoan
himself *before* receiving pardon, because the time of repentance is
coincident with that of peril and of fear. Not that I deny that the
divine benefit—the putting away of sins, I mean—is in every way sure to
such as are on the point of entering the (baptismal) water; but what we
have to labour for is, that it may be granted us to attain that
blessing. For who will grant to you, a man of so faithless repentance,
one single sprinkling of any water whatever? To approach it by stealth,
indeed, and to get the minister appointed over this business misled by
your asseverations, is easy; but God takes foresight for His own
treasure, and suffers not the unworthy to steal a march upon it. What,
in fact, does He say? “Nothing hid which shall not be revealed.” <span
id="fr_8470"></span>[8471](#fn_8470) Draw whatever (veil of.md) darkness
you please over your deeds, “God is light.” <span
id="fr_8471"></span>[8472](#fn_8471.md) But some think as if God were under
a *necessity* of bestowing even on the unworthy, what He has engaged (to
give); and they turn His liberality into slavery. But if it is of
necessity that God grants us the symbol of death, <span
id="fr_8472"></span>[8473](#fn_8472.md) then He does so *unwillingly*. But
who permits a gift to be permanently retained which he has granted
unwillingly?  For do not many afterward fall out of (grace)? is not this
gift taken away from many? These, no doubt, are they who do steal a
march upon (the treasure), who, after approaching to the faith of
repentance, set up on the sands a house doomed to ruin. Let no one,
then, flatter himself on the ground of being assigned to the
“recruit-classes” of learners, as if on that account he have a licence
even now to sin.  As soon as you “know the Lord,” <span
id="fr_8473"></span>[8474](#fn_8473.md) you should fear Him; as soon as you
have gazed on Him, you should reverence Him. But what difference does
*your* “knowing” Him make, while you rest in the same practises as in
days bygone, when you knew Him *not*? What, moreover, is it <span
id="page_662">p. 662</span> <span id="vi.ii.vi-Page_662"></span>which
distinguishes you from a perfected <span
id="fr_8474"></span>[8475](#fn_8474.md) servant of God? Is there one Christ
for the baptized, another for the learners?  Have they some different
hope or reward? some different dread of judgment? some different
necessity for repentance? That *baptismal* washing is a sealing of
faith, which faith is begun and is commended by the faith of repentance.
We are not washed *in order that* we *may* cease sinning, but *because*
we *have* ceased, since in *heart* we have *been* bathed <span
id="fr_8475"></span>[8476](#fn_8475.md) already. For the *first* baptism of
a learner is *this*, a perfect fear; <span
id="fr_8476"></span>[8477](#fn_8476.md) thenceforward, in so far as you
have understanding of the Lord faith *is* sound, the conscience having
once for all embraced repentance. Otherwise, if it is (only) after the
*baptismal* waters that we cease sinning, it is of *necessity*, not of
*free-will*, that we put on innocence. Who, then, is pre-eminent in
goodness? he who is not *allowed*, or he whom *it displeases*, to be
evil? he who is *bidden*, or he whose *pleasure it is*, to be free from
crime? Let us, then, neither keep our hands from theft unless the
hardness of bars withstand us, nor refrain our eyes from the
concupiscence of fornication unless we be withdrawn by guardians of our
persons, if no one who has surrendered himself to the Lord is to cease
sinning unless he be bound thereto by baptism.  But if any entertain
this sentiment, I know not whether he, after baptism, do not feel more
sadness to think that he has *ceased* from sinning, than gladness that
he hath *escaped* from it. And so it is becoming that learners *desire*
baptism, but do not hastily *receive* it: for he who desires it, honours
it; he who hastily receives it, disdains it: in the one appears modesty,
in the other arrogance; the former satisfies, the latter neglects it;
the former covets to merit it, but the latter promises it to himself as
a due return; the former takes, the latter usurps it. Whom would you
judge worthier, except one who is more amended? whom more amended,
except one who is more timid, and on that account has fulfilled the duty
of true repentance? for he has feared to continue still in sin, lest he
should not merit the reception *of baptism*. But the hasty receiver,
inasmuch as he promised it himself (as his due), being forsooth secure
(of obtaining it), *could* not fear: thus he fulfilled not repentance
either, because he lacked the instrumental agent of repentance, that is,
fear. <span id="fr_8477"></span>[8478](#fn_8477.md) Hasty reception is the
portion of irreverence; it inflates the seeker, it despises the Giver.
And thus it sometimes deceives, <span
id="fr_8478"></span>[8479](#fn_8478.md) for it promises to itself *the
gift* before it be due; whereby He who is to furnish *the gift* is ever
offended.
