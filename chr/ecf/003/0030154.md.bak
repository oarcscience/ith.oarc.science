<span id="iv.viii.i.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV. <span
id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) —The Vile Calumny About Onocoetes
Retorted on the Heathen by Tertullian.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xiv-p3"></span>Report has introduced a new calumny
respecting our God. Not so long ago, a most abandoned wretch in that
city of yours, <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md) a man who had
deserted indeed his own religion—a Jew, in fact, who had only lost his
skin, flayed of course by wild beasts, <span
id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) against which he enters the lists for
hire day after day with a sound body, and so in a condition to lose his
skin <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) —carried about in public a
caricature of us with this label: *Onocoetes*. <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682) This (figure.md) had ass’s ears, and was
dressed in a *toga* with a book, having a hoof on one of his feet. And
the crowd believed this infamous Jew. For what other set of men is the
seed-plot <span id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) of all the calumny
against us?  Throughout the city, therefore, Onocoetes is all the talk.
As, however, it is less then “a nine days’ wonder,” <span
id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) and so destitute of all authority from
time, and weak enough from the character of its author, I shall gratify
myself by using it simply in the way of a retort. Let us then see
whether you are not here also found in our company. Now it matters not
what their form may be, when our concern is about deformed images. You
have amongst you gods with a dog’s head, and a lion’s head, with the
horns of a cow, and a ram, and a goat, goat-shaped or serpent-shaped,
and winged in foot, head, and back. Why therefore brand our one God so
conspicuously? Many an *Onocoetes* is found amongst yourselves.

id="iv.viii.i.xiv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xiv-p5"></span> This is explained in the passage of
*The Apology* (xvi.): “He had for money exposed himself with criminals
to fight with wild beasts.”

<span id="fn_681"></span>[123:682](0030154.htm#fr_681.md) <span
id="iv.viii.i.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xiv-p6"></span> Decutiendus, from a jocular word,
“decutire.”

<span id="fn_682"></span>[123:683](0030154.htm#fr_682.md) <span
id="iv.viii.i.xiv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xiv-p7"></span> This curious word is compounded of
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.xiv-p7.1"></span>ὅνος</span>,
*an ass*, and <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xiv-p7.2"></span>κοιᾶσθαι</span>, which Hesychius explains
by <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xiv-p7.3"></span>ἰερᾶσθαι</span>, *to act as a priest*.
The word therefore means, “asinarius sacerdos,” “an ass of a priest.”
Calumnious enough; but suited to the vile occasion, and illustrative of
the ribald opposition which Christianity had to encounter.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xiv-p8"></span> We take Rigaltius’ reading,
“seminarium.”
