<span id="iv.x.vii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.x.vii-p5.1"></span>The</span> passage referred to in the note,
begins thus in Jowett’s rendering:  “The Ruler of the Universe has
ordered all things with a view to the preservation and perfection of the
whole etc.”  So, in the same book: “Surely God must not be supposed to
have a nature which he himself hates.” Again:  “Let us not, then, deem
God inferior to human workmen, who in proportion to their skill finish
and perfect their works…or that God, the wisest of beings, who is
willing and able to extend his care to all things, etc.” Now, it is a
sublime plan which our author here takes up, (making only slight
reference to the innumerable citations which were behind his apostrophe
to the soul if any one should dispute it) to bid the soul stand forth
and confess its consciousness of God.

<span id="iv.x.vii-p8"></span>Those who would pursue the subject of
Demonology, which Tertullian opens in this admirable treatise, should
follow it up in a writer whom Tertullian greatly influenced, in many
particulars, even when he presents a remarkable contrast. The Ninth Book
of the *City of God* is devoted to inquiries which throw considerable
light on some of the startling sayings of our author as to the heathen
systems, and their testimony to the Soul’s Consciousness of God and of
the great enemy of God and the inferior spirit of Evil.
