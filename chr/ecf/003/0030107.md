<span id="iv.v.xxiii-p2"></span>Seeing, then, man’s own reflections,
even in spite of the sweetness of pleasure, lead him to think that
people such as these should be condemned to a hapless lot of infamy,
losing all the advantages connected with the possession of the dignities
of life, how much more does the divine righteousness inflict punishment
on those who give themselves to these arts! Will God have any pleasure
in the charioteer who disquiets so many souls, rouses up so many furious
passions, and creates so many various moods, either crowned like a
priest or wearing the colours of a pimp, decked out by the devil that he
may be whirled away in his chariot, as though with the object of taking
off Elijah? Will He be pleased with him who applies the razor to
himself, and completely changes his features; who, with no respect for
his face, is not content with making it as like as possible to Saturn
and Isis and Bacchus, but gives it quietly over to contumelious blows,
as if in mockery of our Lord? The devil, forsooth, makes it part, too,
of his teaching, that the cheek is to be meekly offered to the smiter.
In the same way, with their high shoes, he has made the tragic actors
taller, because “none can add a cubit to his stature.” <span
id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365) His desire is to make Christ a liar.
And in regard to the wearing of masks, I ask is that according to the
mind of God, who forbids the making of every likeness, and especially
then the likeness of man who is His own image? The Author of truth hates
all the false; He regards as adultery all that is unreal.  Condemning,
therefore, as He does hypocrisy in every form, He never will approve any
putting on of voice, or sex, or age; He never will approve pretended
loves, and wraths, and groans, and tears. Then, too, as in His law it is
declared that the man is cursed who attires himself in female
garments, <span id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366) what must be His
judgment of the pantomime, who is even brought up to play the woman! And
will the boxer go unpunished? I suppose he received these cæstus-scars,
and the thick skin of his fists, and these growths upon his ears, at his
creation! God, too, gave him eyes for no other end than that they might
be knocked out in fighting! I say nothing of him who, to save himself,
thrusts another in the lion’s way, that he may not be too little of a
murderer when he puts to death that very same man on the arena.
