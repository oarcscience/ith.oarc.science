id="iv.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.vi-p2"></span>Demanding then a law of God, you have that
common one prevailing all over the world, engraven on the natural tables
to which the apostle too is wont to appeal, as when in respect of the
woman’s veil he says, “Does not even Nature teach you?” <span
id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md) —as when to the Romans, affirming that
the heathen do by nature those things which the law requires, <span
id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399.md) he suggests both natural law and a
law-revealing nature. Yes, and also in the first chapter of the epistle
he authenticates nature, when he asserts that males and females changed
among themselves the natural use of the creature into that which is
unnatural, <span id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400.md) by way of penal
retribution for their error.  We first of all indeed know God Himself by
the teaching of Nature, calling Him God of gods, taking for granted that
He is good, and invoking Him as Judge. Is it a question with you whether
for the enjoyment of His creatures, Nature should be our guide, that we
may not be carried away in the direction in which the rival of God has
corrupted, along with man himself, the entire creation which had been
made over to our race for certain uses, whence the apostle says that it
too unwillingly became subject to vanity, completely bereft of its
original character, first by vain, then by base, unrighteous, and
ungodly uses? It is thus, accordingly, in the pleasures of the shows,
that the creature is dishonoured by those who by nature indeed perceive
that all the materials of which shows are got up belong to God, but lack
the knowledge to perceive as well that they have all been changed by the
devil. But with this topic we have, for the sake of our own play-lovers,
sufficiently dealt, and that, too, in a work in Greek. <span
