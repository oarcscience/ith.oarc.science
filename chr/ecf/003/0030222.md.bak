<span id="iv.xi.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Plato Suggested Certain
Errors to the Gnostics.  Functions of the Soul.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xviii-p2"></span>I turn now to the department of our
intellectual faculties, such as Plato has handed it over to the
heretics, distinct from our bodily functions, having obtained the
knowledge of them before death. <span
id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619.md) He asks in the *Phædo*, What, then,
(do you think) concerning the actual possession of *knowledge*? Will the
body be a hindrance to it or not, if one shall admit it as an associate
in the search after knowledge? I have a similar question to ask: Have
the faculties of their sight and hearing any truth and reality for human
beings or not?  Is it not the case, that even the poets are always
muttering against us, that we can never hear or see anything for
certain? He remembered, no doubt, what Epicharmus the comic poet had
said: “It is the mind which sees, the mind that hears—all else is blind
and deaf.” To the same purport he says again, that man is the wisest
whose mental power is the clearest; who never applies the sense of
sight, nor adds to his mind the help of any such faculty, but employs
the intellect itself in unmixed serenity when he indulges in
contemplation for the purpose of acquiring an unalloyed insight into the
nature of things; divorcing himself with all his might from his eyes and
ears and (as one must express himself) from the whole of his body, on
the ground of its disturbing the soul, and not allowing it to possess
either truth or wisdom, whenever it is brought into communication with
it. We see, then, that in opposition to the bodily senses another
faculty is provided of a much more serviceable character, even the
powers of the soul, which produce an understanding of that truth whose
realities are not palpable nor open to the bodily senses, but are very
remote from men’s everyday knowledge, lying in secret—in the heights
above, and in the presence of God Himself. For Plato maintains that
there are certain invisible substances, incorporeal, celestial, <span
id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md) divine, and eternal, which they
call *ideas*, that is to say, (archetypal) forms, which are the patterns
and causes of those objects of nature which are manifest to us, and lie
under our corporeal senses: the former, (according to Plato,) are the
actual verities, and <span id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span
id="iv.xi.xviii-Page_198"></span>the latter the images and likenesses of
them. Well, now, are there not here gleams of the heretical principles
of the Gnostics and the Valentinians? It is from this philosophy that
they eagerly adopt the difference between the bodily senses and the
intellectual faculties,—a distinction which they actually apply to the
parable of the ten virgins: making the five foolish virgins to symbolize
the five bodily senses, seeing that these are so silly and so easy to be
deceived; and the wise virgin to express the meaning of the intellectual
faculties, which are so wise as to attain to that mysterious and
supernal truth, which is placed in the pleroma. (Here, then, we have)
the mystic original of the ideas of these heretics. For in this
philosophy lie both their Æons and their genealogies. Thus, too, do they
divide sensation, both into the intellectual powers from their spiritual
seed, and the sensuous faculties from the animal, which cannot by any
means comprehend spiritual things. From the former germ spring invisible
things; from the latter, visible things which are grovelling and
temporary, and which are obvious to the senses, placed as they are in
palpable forms. <span id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md) It is because
of these views that we have in a former passage stated as a preliminary
fact, that the mind is nothing else than an apparatus or instrument of
the soul, <span id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622.md) and that the spirit
is no other faculty, separate from the soul, but is the soul itself
exercised in respiration; although that influence which either God on
the one hand, or the devil on the other, has breathed upon it, must be
regarded in the light of an additional element. <span
id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md) And now, with respect to the
difference between the intellectual powers and the sensuous faculties,
we only admit it so far as the natural diversity between them requires
of us. (There is, of course, a difference) between things corporeal and
things spiritual, between visible and invisible beings, between objects
which are manifest to the view and those which are hidden from it;
because the one class are attributed to sensation, and the other to the
intellect. But yet both the one and the other must be regarded as
inherent in the soul, and as obedient to it, seeing that it embraces
bodily objects by means of the body, in exactly the same way that it
conceives incorporeal objects by help of the mind, except that it is
even exercising sensation when it is employing the intellect. For is it
not true, that to employ the senses is to use the intellect? And to
employ the intellect amounts to a use of the senses? <span
id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md) What indeed can sensation be, but
the understanding of that which is the object of the sensation? And what
can the intellect or understanding be, but the seeing of that which is
the object understood? Why adopt such excruciating means of torturing
simple knowledge and crucifying the truth? Who can show me the sense
which does not understand the object of its sensation, or the intellect
which perceives not the object which it understands, in so clear a way
as to prove to me that the one can do without the other? If corporeal
things are the objects of sense, and incorporeal ones objects of the
intellect, it is the *classes* of the objects which are different, not
the domicile or abode of sense and intellect; in other words, not the
soul (*anima*) and the mind (*animus*). By what, in short, are corporeal
things perceived?  If it is by the soul, <span
id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625.md) then the mind is a sensuous
faculty, and not merely an intellectual power; for whilst it
understands, it also perceives, because without the perception there is
no understanding. If, however, corporeal things are perceived by the
soul, then it follows that the soul’s power is an intellectual one, and
not merely a sensuous faculty; for while it perceives it also
understands, because without understanding there is no perceiving. And
then, again, by what are incorporeal things understood? If it is by the
mind, <span id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626.md) where will be the soul?
If it is by the soul, where will be the mind? For things which differ
ought to be mutually absent from each other, when they are occupied in
their respective functions and duties. It must be your opinion, indeed,
that the mind is absent from the soul on certain occasions; for (you
suppose) that we are so made and constituted as not to know that we have
seen or heard something, on the hypothesis <span
id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md) that the mind was absent at the
time. I must therefore maintain that the very soul itself neither saw
nor heard, since it was at the given moment absent with its active
power—that is to say, the mind. The truth is, that whenever a man is out
of his mind, <span id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628.md) it is his soul
that is demented—not because the mind is absent, but because it is a
fellow-sufferer (with the soul) at the time. <span
id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629.md) Indeed, it is the soul which is
principally affected by casualties of such a kind.  Whence is this fact
confirmed? It is confirmed from the follow<span id="page_199">p.
199</span> <span id="iv.xi.xviii-Page_199"></span>ing consideration:
that after the soul’s departure, the mind is no longer found in a man:
it always follows the soul; nor does it at last remain behind it alone,
after death. Now, since it follows the soul, it is also indissolubly
attached to it; just as the understanding is attached to the soul, which
is followed by the mind, with which the understanding is indissolubly
connected. Granted now that the understanding is superior to the senses,
and a better discoverer of mysteries, what matters it, so long as it is
only a peculiar faculty of the soul, just as the senses themselves are?
It does not at all affect my argument, unless the understanding were
held to be superior to the senses, for the purpose of deducing from the
allegation of such superiority its separate condition likewise. After
thus combating their alleged difference, I have also to refute this
question of superiority, previous to my approaching the belief (which
heresy propounds) in a superior god. On this point, however, of a
(superior) god, we shall have to measure swords with the heretics on
their own ground. <span id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md) Our present
subject concerns the soul, and the point is to prevent the insidious
ascription of a superiority to the intellect or understanding. Now,
although the objects which are touched by the intellect are of a higher
nature, since they are spiritual, than those which are embraced by the
senses, since these are corporeal, it will still be only a superiority
in the *objects*—as of lofty ones contrasted with humble—not in the
*faculties* of the intellect against the senses. For how can the
intellect be superior to the senses, when it is these which educate it
for the discovery of various truths? It is a fact, that these truths are
learned by means of palpable forms; in other words, invisible things are
discovered by the help of visible ones, even as the apostle tells us in
his epistle: “For the invisible things of Him are clearly seen from the
creation of the world, being understood by the things that are
made;” <span id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631.md) and as Plato too might
inform our heretics:  “The things which appear are the image <span
id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md) of the things which are concealed
from view,” <span id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md) whence it must
needs follow that this world is by all means an image of some other: so
that the intellect evidently uses the senses for its own guidance, and
authority, and mainstay; and without the senses truth could not be
attained.  How, then, can a thing be superior to that which is
instrumental to its existence, which is also indispensable to it, and to
whose help it owes everything which it acquires? Two conclusions
therefore follow from what we have said: (1) That the intellect is not
to be preferred above the senses, on the (supposed) ground that the
agent through which a thing exists is inferior to the thing itself; and
(2) that the intellect must not be separated from the senses, since the
instrument by which a thing’s existence is sustained is associated with
the thing itself.
