<span id="iv.iv.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—The Cases of Servants and
Other Officials. What Offices a Christian Man May Hold.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xvii-p2"></span>But what shall believing servants or
children <span id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) do? officials likewise,
when attending on their lords, or patrons, or superiors, when
sacrificing? Well, if any one shall have handed the wine to a
sacrificer, nay, if by any <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> <span
id="iv.iv.xvii-Page_72"></span>single word necessary or belonging to a
sacrifice he shall have aided him, he will be held to be a minister of
idolatry. Mindful of this rule, we can render service even “to
magistrates and powers,” after the example of the patriarchs and the
other forefathers, <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) who obeyed
idolatrous kings up to the confine of idolatry. Hence arose, very
lately, a dispute whether a servant of God should take the
administration of any dignity or power, if he be able, whether by some
special grace, or by adroitness, to keep himself intact from every
species of idolatry; after the example that both Joseph and Daniel,
clean from idolatry, administered both dignity and power in the livery
and purple of the prefecture of entire Egypt or Babylonia. And so let us
grant that it is possible for any one to succeed in moving, in
whatsoever office, under the mere *name* of the office, neither
sacrificing nor lending his authority to sacrifices; not farming out
victims; not assigning to others the care of temples; not looking after
their tributes; not giving spectacles at his own or the public charge,
or presiding over the giving them; making proclamation or edict for no
solemnity; not even taking oaths: moreover (what comes under the head of
*power*), neither sitting in judgment on any one’s life or character,
for you might bear with his judging about *money*; neither condemning
nor fore-condemning; <span id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) binding no
one, imprisoning or torturing no one—if it is credible that all this is
possible.

<span id="iv.iv.xvii-p3"></span> This is Oehler’s reading; Regaltius and
Fr. Junius would read “liberti” = freedmen. I admit that in this
instance I prefer their reading; among other reasons it answers better
to “patronis” ="patrons.”

rendered simply “ancients;” but I have kept the common meaning
“forefathers.”

fore-condemns.”—<span class="sc"><span
