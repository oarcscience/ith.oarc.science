<span id="v.iv.iii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—The Tables Turned Upon
Marcion, by Contrasts, in Favour of the True God.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xxviii-p2"></span>Now, touching the weaknesses and
malignities, and the other (alleged), notes (of the Creator), I too
shall advance *antitheses* in rivalry to Marcion’s. If my God knew not
of any other superior to Himself, your god also was utterly unaware that
there was any beneath himself. It is just what Heraclitus “the
obscure” <span id="fr_3068"></span>[3069](#fn_3068) said; whether it be
up or down, <span id="fr_3069"></span>[3070](#fn_3069) it comes to the
same thing. If, indeed, he was not ignorant (of his position), it must
have occurred to Him from the beginning. Sin and death, and the author
of sin too—the devil—and all the evil which my God permitted to be, this
also, did your god permit; for he allowed Him to permit it. Our God
changed His purposes; <span id="fr_3070"></span>[3071](#fn_3070) in like
manner yours did also. For he who cast his look so late in the human
race, changed that purpose, which for so long a period had refused to
cast that look.  Our God repented Him of the evil in a given case; so
also did yours. For by the fact that he at last had regard to the
salvation of man, he showed such a repentance of his previous
disregard <span id="fr_3071"></span>[3072](#fn_3071) as was due for a
wrong deed. But neglect of man’s salvation will be accounted a wrong
deed, simply because it has been remedied <span
id="fr_3072"></span>[3073](#fn_3072) by his repentance in the conduct of
your god.  Our God you say commanded a fraudulent act, but in a matter
of gold and silver. Now, inasmuch as man is more precious than gold and
silver, in so far is your god more fraudulent still, because he robs man
of his Lord and Creator. Eye for eye does our God require; but your god
does even a greater injury, (in your ideas,) when he prevents an act of
retaliation.  For what man will not return a blow, without waiting to be
struck a second time. <span id="fr_3073"></span>[3074](#fn_3073) Our
<span id="page_320">p. 320</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.xxviii-Page_320"></span>God (you say) knows not whom He
ought to choose. Nor does your god, for if he had foreknown the issue,
he would not have chosen the traitor Judas. If you allege that the
Creator practised deception <span id="fr_3074"></span>[3075](#fn_3074)
in any instance, there was a far greater mendacity in your Christ, whose
very body was unreal. <span id="fr_3075"></span>[3076](#fn_3075) Many
were consumed by the severity of my God. Those also who were not saved
by your god are verily disposed by him to ruin.  My God ordered a man to
be slain.  Your god willed himself to be put to death; not less a
homicide against himself than in respect of him by whom he meant to be
slain. I will moreover prove to Marcion that they were many who were
slain by his god; for he made every one a homicide: in other words, he
doomed him to perish, except when people failed in no duty towards
Christ. <span id="fr_3076"></span>[3077](#fn_3076) But the
straightforward virtue of truth is contented with few resources. <span
id="fr_3077"></span>[3078](#fn_3077) Many things will be necessary for
falsehood.
