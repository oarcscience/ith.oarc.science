<span id="iv.xi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Spirit—A Term Expressive of an
Operation of the Soul, Not of Its Nature.  To Be Carefully Distinguished
from the Spirit of God.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xi-p2"></span>But the nature of my present inquiry
obliges me to call the soul spirit or breath, because to breathe is
ascribed to another substance. We, however, claim this (operation) for
the soul, which we acknowledge to be an indivisible simple substance,
and therefore we must call it spirit in a definitive sense—not because
of its condition, but of its action; not in respect of its nature, but
of its operation; because it *respires*, and not because it is spirit
<span id="page_191">p. 191</span> <span id="iv.xi.xi-Page_191"></span>in
any especial sense. <span id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560) For to
blow or breathe is to respire. So that we are driven to describe, by
(the term which indicates this respiration—that is to say) *spirit*—the
soul which we hold to be, by the propriety of its action, breath.
Moreover, we properly and especially insist on calling it breath (or
spirit), in opposition to Hermogenes, who derives the soul from matter
instead of from the *afflatus* or breath of God. He, to be sure, goes
flatly against the testimony of Scripture, and with this view converts
breath into spirit, because he cannot believe that the (creature on
which was breathed the) Spirit of God fell into sin, and then into
condemnation; and therefore he would conclude that the soul came from
matter rather than from the Spirit or breath of God. For this reason, we
on our side even from that passage, maintain the soul to be breath and
not the spirit, in the scriptural and distinctive sense of the spirit;
and here it is with regret that we apply the term spirit at all in the
lower sense, in consequence of the identical action of respiring and
breathing.  In that passage, the only question is about the natural
substance; to respire being an act of nature. I would not tarry a moment
longer on this point, were it not for those heretics who introduce into
the soul some spiritual germ which passes my comprehension: (they make
it to have been) conferred upon the soul by the secret liberality of her
mother Sophia (*Wisdom*), without the knowledge of the Creator. <span
id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561) But (Holy) Scripture, which has a
better knowledge of the soul’s Maker, or rather God, has told us nothing
more than that God breathed on man’s face the breath of life, and that
man became a living soul, by means of which he was both to live and
breathe; at the same time making a sufficiently clear distinction
between the spirit and the soul, <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562) in such passages as the following,
wherein God Himself declares: “My Spirit went forth from me, and I made
the breath of each. And the breath of my Spirit became soul.” <span
id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563) And again:  “He giveth breath unto
the people that are on the earth, and Spirit to them that walk
thereon.” <span id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564) First of all there
comes the (natural) soul, that is to say, the breath, to the people that
are on the earth,—in other words, to those who act carnally in the
flesh; then afterwards comes the Spirit to those who walk thereon,—that
is, who subdue the works of the flesh; because the apostle also says,
that “that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural,
(or in possession of the natural soul,) and afterward that which is
spiritual.” <span id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565) For, inasmuch as
Adam straightway predicted that “great mystery of Christ and the
church,” <span id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566) when he said, “This
now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; therefore shall a man
leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and
they two shall become one flesh,” <span
id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567) he experienced the influence of the
Spirit.  For there fell upon him that ecstasy, which is the Holy Ghost’s
operative virtue of prophecy. And even the evil spirit too is an
influence which comes upon a man. Indeed, the Spirit of God not more
really “turned Saul into another man,” <span
id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568) that is to say, into a prophet,
when “people said one to another, What is this which is come to the son
of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” <span
id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569) than did the evil spirit afterwards
turn him into another man—in other words, into an apostate. Judas
likewise was for a long time reckoned among the elect (apostles), and
was even appointed to the office of their treasurer; he was not yet the
traitor, although he was become fraudulent; but afterwards the devil
entered into him. Consequently, as the spirit neither of God nor of the
devil is naturally planted with a man’s soul at his birth, this soul
must evidently exist apart and alone, previous to the accession to it of
either spirit: if thus apart and alone, it must also be simple and
uncompounded as regards its substance; and therefore it cannot respire
from any other cause than from the actual condition of its own
substance.
