<span id="v.iv.iv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII. <span
id="fr_3342"></span>[3343](#fn_3342.md) —Types of the Death of Christ.
Isaac; Joseph; Jacob Against Simeon and Levi; Moses Praying Against
Amalek; The Brazen Serpent.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xviii-p3"></span>On the subject of His death, <span
id="fr_3343"></span>[3344](#fn_3343.md) I suppose, you endeavour to
introduce a diversity of opinion, simply because you deny that the
suffering of the cross was predicted of the Christ of the Creator, and
because you contend, moreover, that it is not to be believed that the
Creator would expose His Son to that kind of death on which He had
Himself pronounced a curse. “Cursed,” says He, “is every one who hangeth
on a tree.” <span id="fr_3344"></span>[3345](#fn_3344.md) But what is meant
by this curse, worthy as it is of the simple prediction of the cross, of
which we are now mainly inquiring, I defer to consider, because in
another passage <span id="fr_3345"></span>[3346](#fn_3345.md) we have given
the reason <span id="fr_3346"></span>[3347](#fn_3346.md) of the thing
preceded by proof. First, I shall offer a full explanation <span
id="fr_3347"></span>[3348](#fn_3347.md) of the types. And no doubt it was
proper that this mystery should be prophetically set forth by types, and
indeed chiefly by that method: for in proportion to its incredibility
would it be a stumbling-block, if it were set forth in bare prophecy;
and in proportion too, to its grandeur, was the need of obscuring it in
shadow, <span id="fr_3348"></span>[3349](#fn_3348.md) that the difficulty
of understanding it might lead to prayer for the grace of God. First,
then, Isaac, when he was given up by his father as an offering, himself
carried the wood for his own death. By this act he even then was setting
forth the death of Christ, who was destined by His Father as a
sacrifice, and carried the cross whereon He suffered. Joseph likewise
was a type of Christ, not indeed on this ground (that I may not delay my
course <span id="fr_3349"></span>[3350](#fn_3349) .md), that he suffered
persecution for the cause of God from his brethren, as Christ did from
His brethren after the flesh, the Jews; but when he is blessed by his
father in these words: “His glory is that of a bullock; his horns are
the horns of a unicorn; with them shall he push the nations to the very
ends of the earth,” <span id="fr_3350"></span>[3351](#fn_3350.md) —he was
not, of course, designated as a mere unicorn with its one horn, or a
minotaur with two; but Christ was indicated in him—a bullock in respect
of both His characteristics: to some as severe as a Judge, to others
gentle as a Saviour, whose horns were the extremities of His cross. For
of the antenna, which is a part of a cross, the ends are called *horns*;
while the midway stake of the whole frame is the *unicorn*. By this
virtue, then, of His cross, and in this manner “horned,” He is both now
pushing all nations through faith, bearing them away from earth to
heaven; and will then push them through judgment, casting them down from
heaven to earth. He will also, according to another passage in the same
scripture, be a bullock, when He is spiritually interpreted to be Jacob
against Simeon and Levi, which means against the scribes and the
Pharisees; for it was from them that these last derived their
origin. <span id="fr_3351"></span>[3352](#fn_3351.md) *Like* Simeon and
Levi, they consummated their wickedness by their heresy, with which they
persecuted Christ. “Into their counsel let not my soul enter; to their
assembly let not my heart be united: for in their anger they slew men,”
that is, the prophets; “and in their self-will they hacked the sinews of
a bullock,” <span id="fr_3352"></span>[3353](#fn_3352.md) that is, of
Christ. For against Him did they wreak their fury after they <span
id="page_337">p. 337</span> <span id="v.iv.iv.xviii-Page_337"></span>had
slain His prophets, even by affixing Him with nails to the cross.
Otherwise, it is an idle thing <span
id="fr_3353"></span>[3354](#fn_3353.md) when, after slaying men, he
inveighs against them for the torture of a bullock! Again, in the case
of Moses, wherefore did he at that moment particularly, when Joshua was
fighting Amalek, pray in a sitting posture with outstretched hands, when
in such a conflict it would surely have been more seemly to have bent
the knee, and smitten the breast, and to have fallen on the face to the
ground, and in such prostration to have offered prayer? Wherefore, but
because in a battle fought in the name of that Lord who was one day to
fight against the devil, the shape was necessary of that very cross
through which Jesus was to win the victory? Why, once more, did the same
Moses, after prohibiting the likeness of everything, set up the golden
serpent on the pole; and as it hung there, propose it as an object to be
looked at for a cure? <span id="fr_3354"></span>[3355](#fn_3354.md) Did he
not here also intend to show the power of our Lord’s cross, whereby that
old serpent the devil was vanquished,—whereby also to every man who was
bitten by spiritual serpents, but who yet turned with an eye of faith to
it, was proclaimed a cure from the bite of sin, and health for evermore?

and argued for the exemption of Christ from its terms. He begins that
paragraph with saying, “Sed hujus maledictionis sensum antecedit rerum

off attention from its true force. In the parallel place, however,
another turn is given to the sense; Joseph is a type, “*even on this
