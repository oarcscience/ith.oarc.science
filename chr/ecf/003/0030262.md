<span id="iv.xi.lviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVIII.—Conclusion. Points
Postponed. All Souls are Kept in Hades Until the Resurrection,
Anticipating Their Ultimate Misery or Bliss.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.lviii-p2"></span>All souls, therefore, are shut up
within Hades: do you admit this? (It is true, whether) you say yes or
no: moreover, there are already experienced there punishments and
consolations; and there you have a poor man and a rich. And now, having
postponed some stray questions <span
id="fr_1833"></span>[1834](#fn_1833.md) for this part of my work, I will
notice them in this suitable place, and then come to a close. Why, then,
cannot you suppose that the soul undergoes punishment and consolation in
Hades in the interval, while it awaits its alternative of judgment, in a
certain anticipation either of gloom or of glory?  You reply: Because in
the judgment of God its matter ought to be sure and safe, <span
id="page_235">p. 235</span> <span id="iv.xi.lviii-Page_235"></span>nor
should there be any inkling beforehand of the award of His sentence; and
also because (the soul) ought to be covered first by its vestment <span
id="fr_1834"></span>[1835](#fn_1834.md) of the restored flesh, which, as
the partner of its actions, should be also a sharer in its recompense.
What, then, is to take place in that interval? Shall we sleep? But souls
do not sleep even when men are alive: it is indeed the business of
*bodies* to sleep, to which also belongs death itself, no less than its
mirror and counterfeit sleep. Or will you have it, that nothing is there
done whither the whole human race is attracted, and whither all man’s
expectation is postponed for safe keeping? Do you think this state is a
foretaste of judgment, or its actual commencement? a premature
encroachment on it, or the first course in its full ministration? Now
really, would it not be the highest possible injustice, even <span
id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835.md) in Hades, if all were to be still
well with the guilty even there, and not well with the righteous even
yet? What, would you have hope be still more confused after death? would
you have it mock us still more with uncertain expectation? or shall it
now become a review of past life, and an arranging of judgment, with the
inevitable feeling of a trembling fear? But, again, must the soul always
tarry for the body, in order to experience sorrow or joy? Is it not
sufficient, even of itself, to suffer both one and the other of these
sensations? How often, without any pain to the body, is the soul alone
tortured by ill-temper, and anger, and fatigue, and very often
unconsciously, even to itself? How often, too, on the other hand, amidst
bodily suffering, does the soul seek out for itself some furtive joy,
and withdraw for the moment from the body’s importunate society? I am
mistaken if the soul is not in the habit, indeed, solitary and alone, of
rejoicing and glorifying over the very tortures of the body.  Look for
instance, at the soul of Mutius *Scævola* as he melts his right hand
over the fire; look also at Zeno’s, as the torments of Dionysius pass
over it. <span id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836.md) The bites of wild
beasts are a glory to young heroes, as on Cyrus were the scars of the
bear. <span id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837.md) Full well, then, does
the soul even in Hades know how to joy and to sorrow even without the
body; since when in the flesh it feels pain when it likes, though the
body is unhurt; and when it likes it feels joy though the body is in
pain. Now if such sensations occur at its will during life, how much
rather may they not happen after death by the judicial appointment of
God! Moreover, the soul executes not all its operations with the
ministration of the flesh; for the judgment of God pursues even simple
cogitations and the merest volitions. “Whosoever looketh on a woman to
lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his
heart.” <span id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838.md) Therefore, even for
this cause it is most fitting that the soul, without at all waiting for
the flesh, should be punished for what it has done without the
partnership of the flesh. So, on the same principle, in return for the
pious and kindly thoughts in which it shared not the help of the flesh,
shall it without the flesh receive its consolation.  Nay more, <span
id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839.md) even in matters done through the
flesh the soul is the first to conceive them, the first to arrange them,
the first to authorize them, the first to precipitate them into acts.
And even if it is sometimes unwilling to act, it is still the first to
treat the object which it means to effect by help of the body.  In no
case, indeed, can an accomplished fact be prior to the mental
conception <span id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840.md) thereof. It is
therefore quite in keeping with this order of things, that that part of
our nature should be the first to have the recompense and reward to
which they are due on account of its priority. In short, inasmuch as we
understand “the prison” pointed out in the Gospel to be Hades, <span
id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841.md) and as we also interpret “the
uttermost farthing” <span id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842.md) to mean
the very smallest offence which has to be recompensed there before the
resurrection, <span id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843.md) no one will
hesitate to believe that the soul undergoes in Hades some compensatory
discipline, without prejudice to the full process of the resurrection,
when the recompense will be administered through the flesh besides. This
point the Paraclete has also pressed home on our attention in most
frequent admonitions, whenever any of us has admitted the force of His
words from a knowledge of His promised spiritual disclosures. <span
id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844.md) And now at last having, as I
believe, encountered every human opinion concerning the soul, and tried
its character by the teaching of (our holy faith,) we have satisfied the
curiosity which is simply a reasonable and necessary one.  As for that
which is extravagant and idle, there will evermore be as great a defect
in its information, as there has been exaggeration and self-will in its
researches.
