id="v.viii.xlv-Page_578"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV.—The Old Man and the New Man of
St. Paul Explained.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xlv-p2"></span>But in their blindness they again impale
themselves on the point of the old and the new man. When the apostle
enjoins us “to put off the old man, which is corrupt according to the
deceitful lusts; and to be renewed in the spirit of our mind; and to put
on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
holiness,” <span id="fr_7579"></span>[7580](#fn_7579) (they maintain.md)
that by here also making a distinction between the two substances, *and
applying* the old one to the flesh and the new one to the spirit, he
ascribes to the old man—that is to say, the flesh—a permanent
corruption.  Now, if you follow the order of the substances, the soul
cannot be the new man because it comes the later of the two; nor can the
flesh be the old man because it is the former. For what fraction of time
was it that intervened between the *creative* hand of God and His
*afflatus*? I will venture to say, that even if the soul was a good deal
prior to the flesh, by the very circumstance that the soul had to wait
to be itself completed, it made the other <span
id="fr_7580"></span>[7581](#fn_7580.md) really the former. For everything
which gives the finishing stroke and perfection to a work, although it
is subsequent in its mere order, yet has the priority in its effect.
Much more is that prior, without which preceding things could have no
existence.  If the flesh be the old man, when did it become so? From the
beginning? But Adam was wholly a new man, and of that new man there
could be no part an old man.  And from that time, ever since the
blessing which was pronounced upon man’s generation, <span
id="fr_7581"></span>[7582](#fn_7581.md) the flesh and the soul have had a
simultaneous birth, without any calculable difference in time; so that
the two have been even generated together in the womb, as we have shown
in our *Treatise on the Soul*. <span
id="fr_7582"></span>[7583](#fn_7582.md) Contemporaneous in the womb, they
are also temporally identical in their birth. The two are no doubt
produced by human parents <span id="fr_7583"></span>[7584](#fn_7583.md) of
two substances, but not at two different periods; rather they are so
entirely one, that neither is before the other *in point of time*. It is
more correct (to say), that we are either entirely the old man or
entirely the new, for we cannot tell how we can possibly be anything
else. But the apostle mentions a very clear mark of the old man. For
“put off,” says he, “concerning the former conversation, the old
man;” <span id="fr_7584"></span>[7585](#fn_7584) (he does.md) not *say*
concerning the seniority of either substance. It is not indeed the flesh
which he bids us to put off, but the works which he in another passage
shows to be “works of the flesh.” <span
id="fr_7585"></span>[7586](#fn_7585.md) He brings no accusation against
men’s bodies, of which he even writes as follows:  “Putting away lying,
speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of
another. Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your
wrath: neither give place to the devil. Let him that stole steal no
more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands (the thing which
is good), that he may have to give to him that needeth. Let no corrupt
communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good for the
edification of faith, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.  And
grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and
evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: but be ye kind one
to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ
hath forgiven you.” <span id="fr_7586"></span>[7587](#fn_7586.md) Why,
therefore, do not those who suppose the flesh to be the old man, hasten
their own death, in order that by laying aside the old man they may
satisfy the apostle’s precepts? As for ourselves, we believe that the
whole of faith is to be administered *in* the flesh, nay more, *by* the
flesh, which has both a mouth for the utterance of all holy words, and a
tongue to refrain from blasphemy, and a heart to avoid all irritation,
and hands to labour and to give; while we also maintain that as well the
old man as the new has relation to the difference of moral conduct, and
not to any discrepancy of nature. And just as we acknowledge that that
which according to its former conversation was “the old man” was also
corrupt, and received its very name in accordance with “its deceitful
lusts,” so also (do we hold) that it is “the old man in reference to its
former conversation,” <span id="fr_7587"></span>[7588](#fn_7587.md) and not
in respect of the flesh through any permanent dissolution. Moreover, it
is still unimpaired in the flesh, and identical in that nature, even
when it has become “the new man;” since it is of its sinful course of
life, and not of its corporeal substance, that it has been divested.
