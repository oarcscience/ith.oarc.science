<span id="v.iv.iii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—This Liberty Vindicated in
Respect of Its Original Creation; Suitable Also for Exhibiting the
Goodness and the Purpose of God.  Reward and Punishment Impossible If
Man Were Good or Evil Through Necessity and Not Choice.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.vi-p2"></span>But although we shall be understood,
from our argument, to be only so affirming man’s unshackled power over
his will, that what happens to him should be laid to his own charge, and
not to God’s, yet that you may not object, even now, that he ought not
to have been so constituted, since his liberty and power of will might
turn out to be injurious, I will first of all maintain that he was
rightly so constituted, that I may with the greater confidence commend
both his actual constitution, and the additional fact of its being
worthy of the Divine Being; the cause which led to man’s being created
with such a constitution being shown to be the better one. Moreover, man
thus constituted will be protected by both the goodness of God and by
His purpose, <span id="fr_2770"></span>[2771](#fn_2770.md) both of which
are always found in concert in our God. For His purpose is no purpose
without goodness; nor is His goodness goodness without a purpose, except
forsooth in the case of Marcion’s god, who is purposelessly <span
id="fr_2771"></span>[2772](#fn_2771.md) good, as we have shown. <span
id="fr_2772"></span>[2773](#fn_2772.md) Well, then, it was proper that God
should be known; it was no doubt <span
id="fr_2773"></span>[2774](#fn_2773.md) a good and reasonable <span
id="fr_2774"></span>[2775](#fn_2774.md) thing. Proper also was it that
there should be something worthy of knowing God.  What could be found so
worthy as the image and likeness of God? This also was undoubtedly good
and reasonable. Therefore it was proper that (he who is) the image and
likeness of God should be formed with a free will and a mastery of
him<span id="page_302">p. 302</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.vi-Page_302"></span>self; <span
id="fr_2775"></span>[2776](#fn_2775.md) so that this very thing—namely,
freedom of will and self-command—might be reckoned as the image and
likeness of God in him. For this purpose such an essence <span
id="fr_2776"></span>[2777](#fn_2776.md) was adapted <span
id="fr_2777"></span>[2778](#fn_2777.md) to man as suited this
character, <span id="fr_2778"></span>[2779](#fn_2778.md) even the afflatus
of the Deity, Himself free and uncontrolled. <span
id="fr_2779"></span>[2780](#fn_2779.md) But if you will take some other
view of the case, <span id="fr_2780"></span>[2781](#fn_2780.md) how came it
to pass <span id="fr_2781"></span>[2782](#fn_2781.md) that man, when in
possession of the whole world, did not above all things reign in
self-possession <span id="fr_2782"></span>[2783](#fn_2782.md) —a master
over others, a slave to himself?  The goodness of God, then, you can
learn from His gracious gift <span id="fr_2783"></span>[2784](#fn_2783.md)
to man, and His purpose from His disposal of all things. <span
id="fr_2784"></span>[2785](#fn_2784.md) At present, let God’s *goodness*
alone occupy our attention, that which gave so large a gift to man, even
the liberty of his will.  God’s *purpose* claims some other opportunity
of treatment, offering as it does instruction of like import. Now, God
alone is good by nature. For He, who has that which is without
beginning, has it not by creation, <span
id="fr_2785"></span>[2786](#fn_2785.md) but by nature. Man, however, who
exists entirely by creation, having a beginning, along with that
beginning obtained the form in which he exists; and thus he is not by
nature disposed to good, but by creation, not having it as his own
attribute to be good, because, (as we have said,) it is not by nature,
but by creation, that he is disposed to good, according to the
appointment of his good Creator, even the Author of all good. In order,
therefore, that man might have a goodness of his own, <span
id="fr_2786"></span>[2787](#fn_2786.md) bestowed <span
id="fr_2787"></span>[2788](#fn_2787.md) on him by God, and there might be
henceforth in man a property, and in a certain sense a natural attribute
of goodness, there was assigned to him in the constitution of his
nature, as a formal witness <span id="fr_2788"></span>[2789](#fn_2788.md)
of the goodness which God bestowed upon him, freedom and power of the
will, such as should cause good to be performed spontaneously by man, as
a property of his own, on the ground that no less than this <span
id="fr_2789"></span>[2790](#fn_2789.md) would be required in the matter of
a goodness which was to be voluntarily exercised by him, that is to say,
by the liberty of his will, without either favour or servility to the
constitution of his nature, so that man should be good <span
id="fr_2790"></span>[2791](#fn_2790.md) just up to this point, <span
id="fr_2791"></span>[2792](#fn_2791.md) if he should display his goodness
in accordance with his natural constitution indeed, but still as the
result of his will, as a property of his nature; and, by a similar
exercise of volition, <span id="fr_2792"></span>[2793](#fn_2792.md) should
show himself to be too strong <span id="fr_2793"></span>[2794](#fn_2793.md)
in defence against evil also (for even this God, of course, foresaw),
being free, and master of himself; because, if he were wanting in this
prerogative *of self-mastery*, so as to perform even good by necessity
and not will, he would, in the helplessness of his servitude, become
subject to the usurpation of evil, a slave as much to evil as to good.
Entire freedom of will, therefore, was conferred upon him in both
tendencies; so that, as master of himself, he might constantly encounter
good by spontaneous observance of it, and evil by its spontaneous
avoidance; because, were man even otherwise circumstanced, it was yet
his bounden duty, in the judgment of God, to do justice according to the
motions <span id="fr_2794"></span>[2795](#fn_2794.md) of his will regarded,
of course, as free.  But the reward neither of good nor of evil could be
paid to the man who should be found to have been either good or evil
through necessity and not choice. In this really lay <span
id="fr_2795"></span>[2796](#fn_2795.md) the law which did not exclude, but
rather prove, *human* liberty by a spontaneous rendering of obedience,
or a spontaneous commission of iniquity; so patent was the liberty of
man’s will for either issue. Since, therefore, both the goodness and
purpose of God are <span id="fr_2796"></span>[2797](#fn_2796.md) discovered
in the gift to man of freedom in his will, it is not right, after
ignoring the original definition of goodness and purpose which it was
necessary to determine previous to any discussion of the subject, on
subsequent facts to presume to say that God ought not in such a way to
have formed man, because the issue was other than what was assumed to
be <span id="fr_2797"></span>[2798](#fn_2797.md) proper for God. We ought
rather, <span id="fr_2798"></span>[2799](#fn_2798.md) after duly
considering that it behoved God so to create *man*, to leave this
consideration unimpaired, and to survey the other aspects of the case.
It is, no doubt, an easy process for persons who take offence at the
fall of man, before they have looked into the facts of his creation, to
impute the blame of what happened to the Creator, without any
examination of His purpose. To conclude:  the goodness of God, then
fully considered from the beginning of His works, will be enough to
convince us that nothing evil could <span id="page_303">p. 303</span>
<span id="v.iv.iii.vi-Page_303"></span>possibly have come forth from
God; and the liberty of man will, after a second thought, <span
id="fr_2799"></span>[2800](#fn_2799.md) show us that it alone is chargeable
with the fault which itself committed.
