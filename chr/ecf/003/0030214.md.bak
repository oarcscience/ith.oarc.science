<span id="iv.xi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—The Simple Nature of the Soul is
Asserted with Plato. The Identity of Spirit and Soul.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.x-p2"></span>It is essential to a firm faith to declare
with Plato <span id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551.md) that the soul is
simple; in other words uniform and uncompounded; simply that is to say
in respect of its substance.  Never mind men’s artificial views and
theories, and away with the fabrications of heresy! <span
id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552.md) Some maintain that there is within
the soul a natural substance—the spirit—which is different from
it: <span id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553.md) as if to have life—the
function of the soul—were one thing; and to emit breath—the
alleged <span id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md) function of the
spirit—were another thing.  Now it is not in all animals that these two
functions are found; for there are many which only live but do not
breathe in that they do not possess the organs of respiration—lungs and
windpipes. <span id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555.md) But of what use is
it, in an examination of the soul of man, to borrow proofs from a gnat
or an ant, when the great Creator in His divine arrangements has
allotted to every animal organs of vitality suited to its own
disposition and nature, so that we ought not to catch at any conjectures
from comparisons of this sort?  Man, indeed, although organically
furnished with lungs and windpipes, will not on that account be proved
to *breathe* by one process, and to *live* by another; <span
id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556.md) nor can the ant, although defective
in these organs, be on that account said to be without respiration, as
if it lived and that was all. For by whom has so clear an insight into
the works of God been really attained, as to entitle him to assume that
these organic resources are wanting to any living thing? There is that
Herophilus, the well-known surgeon, or (as I may almost call him)
butcher, who cut up no end of persons, <span
id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md) in order to investigate the secrets
of nature, who ruthlessly handled <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558.md) human creatures to discover (their
form and make): I have my doubts whether he succeeded in clearly
exploring all the internal parts of their structure, since death itself
changes and disturbs the natural functions of life, especially when the
death is not a natural one, but such as must cause irregularity and
error amidst the very processes of dissection.  Philosophers have
affirmed it to be a certain fact, that gnats, and ants, and moths have
no pulmonary or arterial organs. Well, then, tell me, you curious and
elaborate investigator of these mysteries, have they eyes for seeing
withal? But yet they proceed to whatever point they wish, and they both
shun and aim at various objects by processes of sight: point out their
eyes to me, show me their pupils. Moths also gnaw and eat: demonstrate
to me their mandibles, reveal their jaw-teeth. Then, <span
id="page_190">p. 190</span> <span id="iv.xi.x-Page_190"></span>again,
gnats hum and buzz, nor even in the dark are they unable to find their
way to our ears: <span id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559.md) point out to
me, then, not only the noisy tube, but the stinging lance of that mouth
of theirs. Take any living thing whatever, be it the tiniest you can
find, it must needs be fed and sustained by some food or other: show me,
then, their organs for taking into their system, digesting, and ejecting
food. What must we say, therefore? If it is by such instruments that
life is maintained, these instrumental means must of course exist in all
things which are to live, even though they are not apparent to the eye
or to the apprehension by reason of their minuteness.  You can more
readily believe this, if you remember that God manifests His creative
greatness quite as much in small objects as in the very largest. If,
however, you suppose that God’s wisdom has no capacity for forming such
infinitesimal corpuscles, you can still recognise His greatness, in that
He has furnished even to the smallest animals the functions of life,
although in the absence of the suitable organs,—securing to them the
power of sight, even without eyes; of eating, even without teeth; and of
digestion, even without stomachs. Some animals also have the ability to
move forward without feet, as serpents, by a gliding motion; or as
worms, by vertical efforts; or as snails and slugs, by their slimy
crawl. Why should you not then believe that respiration likewise may be
effected without the bellows of the lungs, and without arterial canals?
You would thus supply yourself with a strong proof that the spirit or
breath is an adjunct of the human soul, for the very reason that some
creatures lack breath, and that they lack it because they are not
furnished with organs of respiration. You think it possible for a thing
to live without breath; then why not suppose that a thing might breathe
without lungs? Pray, tell me, what is it to breathe? I suppose it means
to emit breath from yourself. What is it not to live? I suppose it means
not to emit breath from yourself. This is the answer which I should have
to make, if “to breathe” is not the same thing as “to live.” It must,
however, be characteristic of a dead man not to respire:  to respire,
therefore, is the characteristic of a living man. But to respire is
likewise the characteristic of a breathing man: therefore also to
breathe is the characteristic of a living man.  Now, if both one and the
other could possibly have been accomplished without the soul, to breathe
might not be a function of the soul, but merely to live. But indeed to
live is to breathe, and to breathe is to live. Therefore this entire
process, both of breathing and living, belongs to that to which living
belongs—that is, to the soul.  Well, then, since you separate the spirit
(or breath) and the soul, separate their operations also. Let both of
them accomplish some act apart from one another—the soul apart, the
spirit apart. Let the soul live without the spirit; let the spirit
breathe without the soul. Let one of them quit men’s bodies, let the
other remain; let death and life meet and agree. If indeed the soul and
the spirit are two, they may be divided; and thus, by the separation of
the one which departs from the one which remains, there would accrue the
union and meeting together of life and of death. But such a union never
will accrue: therefore they are not two, and they cannot be divided; but
divided they might have been, if they had been (two). Still two things
may surely coalesce in growth. But the two in question never will
coalesce, since to live is one thing, and to breathe is another.
Substances are distinguished by their operations. How much firmer ground
have you for believing that the soul and the spirit are but one, since
you assign to them no difference; so that the soul is itself the spirit,
respiration being the function of that of which life also is! But what
if you insist on supposing that the day is one thing, and the light,
which is incidental to the day, is another thing, whereas day is only
the light itself?  There must, of course, be also different kinds of
light, as (appears) from the ministry of fires. So likewise will there
be different sorts of spirits, according as they emanate from God or
from the devil. Whenever, indeed, the question is about soul and spirit,
the soul will be (understood to be) itself the spirit, just as the day
is the light itself. For a thing is itself identical with that by means
of which itself exists.
