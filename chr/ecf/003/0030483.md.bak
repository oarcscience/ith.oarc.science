<span id="v.v.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Tertullian Pushes His Opponent
into a Dilemma.</span>

<span id="v.v.xiv-p2"></span>Now, if it be also argued, that although
Matter may have afforded Him the opportunity, it was still His own will
which led Him to the creation of good creatures, as having
detected <span id="fr_6263"></span>[6264](#fn_6263.md) what was good in
matter—although this, too, be a discreditable supposition <span
id="fr_6264"></span>[6265](#fn_6264.md) —yet, at any rate, when He produces
evil likewise out of the same (Matter), He is a servant to Matter,
since, of course, <span id="fr_6265"></span>[6266](#fn_6265.md) it is not
of His own accord that He produces this too, having nothing else that He
can do than to effect creation out of an evil *stock* <span
id="fr_6266"></span>[6267](#fn_6266.md) —unwillingly, no <span
id="page_485">p. 485</span> <span id="v.v.xiv-Page_485"></span>doubt, as
being good; of necessity, too, as being unwilling; and as an act of
servitude, because from necessity.  Which, then, is the worthier
thought, that He created evil things of necessity, or of His own accord?
Because it was indeed of necessity that He created them, if out of
Matter; of His own accord, if out of nothing. For you are now labouring
in vain when you try to avoid making God the Author of evil things;
because, since He made all things of Matter, they will have to be
ascribed to Himself, who made them, just because <span
id="fr_6267"></span>[6268](#fn_6267.md) He made them. Plainly the interest
of the question, whence He made all things, identifies itself with (the
question), whether He made all things out of nothing; and it matters not
whence He made all things, so that He made all things thence, whence
most glory accrued to Him. <span id="fr_6268"></span>[6269](#fn_6268.md)
Now, more glory accrued to Him from a creation of His own will than from
one of necessity; in other words, from a creation out of nothing, than
from one out of Matter. It is more worthy to believe that God is free,
even as the Author of evil, than that He is a slave. Power, whatever it
be, is more suited to Him than infirmity. <span
id="fr_6269"></span>[6270](#fn_6269.md) If we thus even admit that matter
had nothing good in it, but that the Lord produced whatever good He did
produce of His own power, then some other questions will with equal
reason arise. First, since there was no good at all in Matter, *it is
clear* that good was not made of Matter, on the express ground indeed
that Matter did not possess it. Next, if *good was* not *made* of
Matter, it must then have been made of God; if not of God, then it must
have been made of nothing.—For this is the alternative, on Hermogenes’
own showing. <span id="fr_6270"></span>[6271](#fn_6270.md)
