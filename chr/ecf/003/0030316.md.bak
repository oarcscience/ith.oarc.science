<span id="v.iv.ii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Marcion, Aided by Cerdon,
Teaches a Duality of Gods; How He Constructed This Heresy of an Evil and
a Good God.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.ii-p2"></span>The heretic of Pontus introduces two
Gods, like the twin Symplegades of his own shipwreck: One whom it was
impossible to deny, *i.e.* our Creator; and one whom he will never be
able to prove, *i.e.* his own *god*.  The unhappy man gained <span
id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347.md) the first idea <span
id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348.md) of his conceit from the simple
passage of our Lord’s saying, which has reference to human beings and
not divine ones, wherein He disposes of those examples of a good tree
and a corrupt one; <span id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349.md) how that
“the good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit, neither the corrupt
tree good fruit.” Which means, that an honest mind and good faith cannot
produce evil deeds, any more than an evil disposition can produce good
deeds. Now (like many other persons now-a-days, especially those who
have an heretical proclivity), while morbidly brooding <span
id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350.md) over the question of the origin of
evil, his perception became blunted by the very irregularity of his
researches; and when he found the Creator declaring, “I am He that
createth evil,” <span id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351.md) inasmuch as
he had already concluded from other arguments, which are satisfactory to
every perverted mind, that God is the author of evil, so he now applied
to the Creator the figure of the corrupt tree bringing forth evil fruit,
that is, moral evil, <span id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352.md) and then
presumed that there ought to be another god, after the analogy of the
good tree producing its good fruit.  Accordingly, finding in Christ a
different disposition, as it were—one of a simple and pure
benevolence <span id="fr_2353"></span>[2354](#fn_2353.md) —differing from
the Creator, he readily argued that in his Christ had been revealed a
new and strange <span id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354.md) divinity; and
then with a little leaven he leavened the whole lump of the faith,
flavouring it with the acidity of his own heresy.

<span id="v.iv.ii.ii-p11"></span>He had, moreover, in one <span
id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355.md) Cerdon an abettor of this
blasphemy,—a circumstance which made them the more readily think that
they saw most clearly their two gods, blind though they were; for, in
truth, they had not seen the one God with soundness of faith. <span
id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356.md) To men of diseased vision even one
lamp looks like many. One of his gods, therefore, whom he was obliged to
acknowledge, he destroyed by defaming his attributes in the <span
id="page_273">p. 273</span> <span id="v.iv.ii.ii-Page_273"></span>matter
of evil; the other, whom he laboured so hard to devise, he constructed,
laying his foundation <span id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357.md) in the
principle of good. In what articles <span
id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358.md) he arranged these natures, we show
by our own refutations of them.
