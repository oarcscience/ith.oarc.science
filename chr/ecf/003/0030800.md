id="vi.vii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Of Patience Under
Bereavement.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.ix-p2"></span>Not even that species of impatience under
the loss of our dear ones is excused, where some assertion of a right to
grief acts the patron to it.  For the consideration of the apostle’s
declaration must be set before us, who says, “Be not overwhelmed with
sadness at the falling asleep of any one, just as the nations are who
are without hope.” <span id="fr_9107"></span>[9108](#fn_9107.md) And
justly; or, believing the resurrection of Christ we believe also in our
own, for whose sake He both died and rose again. Since, then, there is
certainty as to the resurrection of the dead, grief for death is
needless, and impatience of grief is needless. For why should you
grieve, if you believe that (your loved one) is not perished? Why should
you bear impatiently the temporary withdrawal of him who you believe
will return?  That which you think to be death is departure. He who goes
before us is not to be lamented, though by all means to be longed
for. <span id="fr_9108"></span>[9109](#fn_9108.md) That longing also must
be tempered with patience. For why should you bear without moderation
*the fact that* one is gone away whom you will presently follow? 
Besides, impatience in matters of this kind bodes ill for our hope, and
is a dealing insincerely with the faith.  And we wound Christ when we
accept not with equanimity the summoning out of this world of any by
Him, as if they were to be pitied. “I desire,” says the apostle, “to be
now received, and to be with Christ.” <span
id="fr_9109"></span>[9110](#fn_9109.md) How far better a desire does *he*
exhibit! If, then, we grieve impatiently over such as *have* attained
the desire of Christians, we show unwillingness ourselves to attain it.
