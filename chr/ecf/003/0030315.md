id="v.iv.ii.i-p7.1"></span>Chapter I.—Preface. Reason for a New Work.
Pontus Lends Its Rough Character to the Heretic Marcion, a Native. His
Heresy Characterized in a Brief Invective.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.i-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.iv.ii.i-p8.1"></span>Whatever</span> in times past <span
id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320.md) we have wrought in opposition to
Marcion, is from the present moment no longer to be accounted of. <span
id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321.md) It is a new work which we are
undertaking in lieu of the old one. <span
id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322.md) My original tract, as too hurriedly
composed, I had subsequently superseded by a fuller treatise. This
latter I lost, before it was completely published, by the fraud of a
person who was then a brother, <span
id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323.md) but became afterwards an apostate.
He, as it happened, had transcribed a portion of it, full of mistakes,
and then published it. The necessity thus arose for an amended work; and
the occasion of the new edition induced me to make a considerable
addition to the treatise.  This present text, <span
id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324.md) therefore, of my work—which is the
third as superseding <span id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325.md) the
second, but henceforward to be considered the first instead of the
third—renders a preface necessary to this issue of the tract itself that
no reader may be perplexed, if he should by chance fall in with the
various forms of it which are scattered about.

<span id="v.iv.ii.i-p15"></span>The Euxine Sea, as it is called, is
self-contradictory in its nature, and deceptive in its name. <span
id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326.md) As you would not account it
hospitable from its situation, so is it severed from our more civilised
waters by a certain stigma which attaches to its barbarous character.
The fiercest nations inhabit it, if indeed it can be called
*habitation*, when life is passed in waggons. They have no fixed abode;
their life has <span id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327.md) no germ of
civilization; they indulge their libidinous desires without restraint,
and for the most part naked.  Moreover, when they gratify secret lust,
they hang up their quivers on their car-yokes, <span
id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328.md) to warn off the curious and rash
observer.  Thus without a blush do they prostitute their weapons of war.
The dead bodies of their parents they cut up with their sheep, and
devour at their feasts.  They who have not died so as to become food for
others, are thought to have died an accursed death. Their women are not
by their sex softened to modesty.  They uncover the breast, from which
they suspend their battle-axes, and prefer warfare to marriage. In their
climate, too, there is the same rude nature. <span
id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329.md) The day-time is never clear, the
sun never cheerful; <span id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330.md) the sky
is uniformly cloudy; the whole year is wintry; the only wind that blows
is the angry North. Waters melt only by fires; their rivers flow not by
reason of the ice; their mountains are covered <span
id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331.md) with heaps of snow. All things are
torpid, all stiff with cold. Nothing there has the glow <span
id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332.md) of life, but that ferocity which
has given to scenic plays their stories of the sacrifices <span
id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333.md) of the Taurians, and the
loves <span id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334.md) of the Colchians, and
the torments <span id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335.md) of the Caucasus.
Nothing, however, in Pontus is so barbarous <span id="page_272">p.
272</span> <span id="v.iv.ii.i-Page_272"></span>and sad as the fact that
Marcion was born there, fouler than any Scythian, more roving than the
waggon-life <span id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336.md) of the Sarmatian,
more inhuman than the Massagete, more audacious than an Amazon, darker
than the cloud, <span id="fr_2337"></span>[2338](#fn_2337) (of Pontus.md)
colder than its winter, more brittle than its ice, more deceitful than
the Ister, more craggy than Caucasus.  Nay <span
id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338.md) more, the true Prometheus, Almighty
God, is mangled <span id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339.md) by Marcion’s
blasphemies. Marcion is more savage than even the beasts of that
barbarous region. For what beaver was ever a greater emasculator <span
id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340.md) than he who has abolished the
nuptial bond?  What Pontic mouse ever had such gnawing powers as he who
has gnawed the Gospels to pieces? Verily, O Euxine, thou hast produced a
monster more credible to philosophers than to Christians. For the cynic
Diogenes used to go about, lantern in hand, at mid-day to find a man;
whereas Marcion has quenched the light of his faith, and so lost the God
whom he had found. His disciples will not deny that his first faith he
held along with ourselves; a letter of his own <span
id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341.md) proves this; so that for the
future <span id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342.md) a heretic may from his
case <span id="fr_2343"></span>[2344](#fn_2343.md) be designated as one
who, forsaking that which was prior, afterwards chose out for himself
that which was not in times past. <span
id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344.md) For in *as* far as what was
delivered in times past and from the beginning will be held as truth, in
*so* far will that be accounted heresy which is brought in later.  But
another brief treatise <span id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345.md) will
maintain this position against heretics, who ought to be refuted even
without a consideration of their doctrines, on the ground that they are
heretical by reason of the novelty of their opinions. Now, so far as any
controversy is to be admitted, I will for the time <span
id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md) (lest our compendious principle of
novelty, being called in on all occasions to our aid, should be imputed
to want of confidence) begin with setting forth our adversary’s rule of
belief, that it may escape no one what our main contention is to be.
