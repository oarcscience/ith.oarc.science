<span id="v.xi.ii"></span>

<span id="v.xi.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.xi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Ophites, Cainites, Sethites.</span>

<span id="v.xi.ii-p2"></span>To these are added those heretics likewise
who are called *Ophites*: <span id="fr_8353"></span>[8354](#fn_8353.md) for
they magnify the serpent to such a degree, that they prefer him even to
Christ Himself; for it was he, they say, who gave us the origin of the
knowledge of good and of evil. <span
id="fr_8354"></span>[8355](#fn_8354) His power and majesty (they say.md)
Moses perceiving, set up the brazen serpent; and whoever gazed upon him
obtained health. <span id="fr_8355"></span>[8356](#fn_8355.md) Christ
Himself (they say further) in His gospel imitates Moses’ serpent’s
sacred power, in saying: “And as Moses upreared the serpent in the
desert, so it behoveth the Son of man to be upreared.” <span
id="fr_8356"></span>[8357](#fn_8356.md) Him they introduce to bless their
eucharistic (elements). <span id="fr_8357"></span>[8358](#fn_8357.md) Now
the whole parade and doctrine of this error flowed from the following
source.  They say that from the supreme primary Æon *whom men speak
of* <span id="fr_8358"></span>[8359](#fn_8358.md) there emanated several
other inferior Æons.  To all these, however, there opposed himself an
Æon who name is *Ialdabaoth*. <span id="fr_8359"></span>[8360](#fn_8359.md)
He had been conceived by the permixture of a second Æon with inferior
Æons; and afterwards, when he <span id="fr_8360"></span>[8361](#fn_8360.md)
had been desirous of forcing his way into the higher regions, had been
disabled by the permixture of the gravity of matter with himself to
arrive at the higher regions; had been left in the midst, and had
extended himself to his full dimensions, and thus had made the
sky. <span id="fr_8361"></span>[8362](#fn_8361.md) *Ialdabaoth*, however,
had descended lower, and had made him seven sons, and had shut from
their view the upper regions by self-distension, in order that, since
(these) angels could not know what was above, <span
id="fr_8362"></span>[8363](#fn_8362.md) they might think him the sole God.
These inferior Virtues and angels, therefore, had made *man*; and,
because he had been originated by weaker and mediocre powers, he lay
crawling, worm-like. That Æon, however, out of which *Ialdaboath* had
proceeded, moved to the heart with envy, had injected into man as he lay
a certain spark; excited whereby, he was through prudence to grow wise,
and be able to understand the things above. So, again, the *Ialdaboath*
aforesaid, turning indignant, had emitted out of himself the Virtue and
similitude of *the serpent*; and this had been <span id="page_651">p.
651</span> <span id="v.xi.ii-Page_651"></span>the Virtue in
paradise—that is, this had been the *serpent*—whom Eve had believed as
if he had been God the Son. <span id="fr_8363"></span>[8364](#fn_8363.md)
He <span id="fr_8364"></span>[8365](#fn_8364.md) plucked, say they, from
the fruit of the tree, and thus conferred on mankind the knowledge of
things good and evil. <span id="fr_8365"></span>[8366](#fn_8365.md) Christ,
moreover, existed not in substance of flesh: salvation of the flesh is
not to be hoped for at all.

<span id="v.xi.ii-p16"></span>Moreover, also, there has broken out
another heresy also, which is called that of the *Cainites*. <span
id="fr_8366"></span>[8367](#fn_8366.md) And the reason is, that they
magnify Cain as if he had been conceived of some potent Virtue which
operated in him; for Abel had been procreated after being conceived of
an inferior Virtue, and accordingly had been found inferior.  They who
assert this likewise defend the traitor Judas, telling us that he is
admirable and great, because of the advantages he is vaunted to have
conferred on mankind; for some of them think that thanksgiving is to be
rendered to Judas on this account: viz., Judas, they say, observing that
Christ wished to subvert the truth, betrayed Him, in order that there
might be no possibility of truth’s being subverted. And others thus
dispute against them, and say: Because the powers of this world <span
id="fr_8367"></span>[8368](#fn_8367.md) were unwilling that Christ should
suffer, lest through His death salvation should be prepared for mankind,
he, consulting for the salvation of mankind, betrayed Christ, in order
that there might be no possibility at all of the salvation being
impeded, which *was* being impeded through the Virtues which were
opposing Christ’s passion; and thus, through the passion of Christ,
there might be no possibility of the salvation of mankind being
retarded.

<span id="v.xi.ii-p19"></span>But, again, the heresy has started forth
which is called that of the *Sethites*. <span
id="fr_8368"></span>[8369](#fn_8368.md) The doctrine of this perversity is
as follows. Two human beings were formed by the angels—Cain and Abel. On
their account arose great contentions and discords among the angels; for
this reason, that Virtue which was above all the Virtues—which they
style the Mother—when they said <span
id="fr_8369"></span>[8370](#fn_8369.md) that Abel had been slain, willed
this Seth of theirs to be conceived and born in place of Abel, in order
that those angels might be escheated who had created those two former
human beings, while this pure seed rises and is born. For they say that
there had been iniquitous permixtures of two angels and human beings;
for which reason that Virtue which (as we have said) they style the
Mother brought on the deluge even, for the purpose of vengeance, in
order that that seed of permixture might be swept away, and this only
seed which was pure be kept entire.  But (in vain): for they who had
originated those of the former seed sent into the ark (secretly and
stealthily, and unknown to that Mother-Virtue), together with those
“eight souls,” <span id="fr_8370"></span>[8371](#fn_8370.md) the seed
likewise of Ham, in order that the seed of evil should not perish, but
should, together with the rest, be preserved, and after the deluge be
restored to the earth, and, by example of the rest, should grow up and
diffuse itself, and fill and occupy the whole orb. <span
id="fr_8371"></span>[8372](#fn_8371.md) Of Christ, moreover, their
sentiments are such that they call Him merely Seth, and say that He was
instead of the actual Seth.
