<span id="v.iv.iii.xxvii"></span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Other Objections
Considered. God’s Condescension in the Incarnation.  Nothing Derogatory
to the Divine Being in This Economy. The Divine Majesty Worthily
Sustained by the Almighty Father, Never Visible to Man.  Perverseness of
the Marcionite Cavils.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xxvii-p2"></span>And now, that I may briefly pass in
review <span id="fr_3043"></span>[3044](#fn_3043) the other points which
you have thus far been engaged in collecting, as mean, weak, and
unworthy, for demolishing <span id="fr_3044"></span>[3045](#fn_3044) the
Creator, I will propound them in a simple and definite statement: <span
id="fr_3045"></span>[3046](#fn_3045) that God would have been unable to
hold any intercourse with men, if He had not taken on Himself the
emotions and affections of man, by means of which He could temper the
strength of His majesty, which would no doubt have been incapable of
endurance to the moderate capacity of man, by such a humiliation as was
indeed degrading <span id="fr_3046"></span>[3047](#fn_3046) to Himself,
but necessary for man, and such as on this very account became worthy of
God, because nothing is so worthy of God as the salvation of man. If I
were arguing with heathens, I should dwell more at length on this point;
although with heretics too the discussion does not stand on very
different grounds. Inasmuch as ye yourselves have now come to the belief
that God moved about <span id="fr_3047"></span>[3048](#fn_3047) in the
form and all other circumstances of man’s nature, <span
id="fr_3048"></span>[3049](#fn_3048) you will of course no longer
require to be convinced that God conformed Himself to humanity, but feel
yourselves bound by your own faith. For if the God (in whom ye believe,)
even from His higher condition, prostrated the supreme dignity of His
majesty to such a lowliness as to undergo death, even the death of the
cross, why can you not suppose that some humiliations <span
id="fr_3049"></span>[3050](#fn_3049) are becoming to our God also, only
more tolerable than Jewish contumelies, and crosses, <span
id="fr_3050"></span>[3051](#fn_3050) and sepulchres? Are these the
humiliations which henceforth are to raise a prejudice against Christ
(the subject as He is of human passions <span
id="fr_3051"></span>[3052](#fn_3051) ) being a partaker of that
Godhead <span id="fr_3052"></span>[3053](#fn_3052) against which you
make the participation in human qualities a reproach? Now we believe
that Christ did ever act in the name of God the Father; that He
actually <span id="fr_3053"></span>[3054](#fn_3053) from the beginning
held intercourse with (men); actually <span
id="fr_3054"></span>[3055](#fn_3054) communed with <span
id="fr_3055"></span>[3056](#fn_3055) patriarchs and prophets; was the
Son of the Creator; was His Word; whom God made His Son <span
id="fr_3056"></span>[3057](#fn_3056) by emitting Him from His own
self, <span id="fr_3057"></span>[3058](#fn_3057) and thenceforth set Him
over every dispensation and (administration of) His will, <span
id="fr_3058"></span>[3059](#fn_3058) making Him a little lower than the
angels, as is written in David. <span
id="fr_3059"></span>[3060](#fn_3059) In which lowering of His condition
He received from the Father a dispensation in those very respects which
you blame as human; from the very beginning learning, <span
id="fr_3060"></span>[3061](#fn_3060) even then, (that state of a) man
which He was destined in the end to become. <span
id="fr_3061"></span>[3062](#fn_3061) It is He <span id="page_319">p.
319</span> <span id="v.iv.iii.xxvii-Page_319"></span>who descends, He
who interrogates, He who demands, He who swears.  With regard, however,
to the Father, the very gospel which is common to us will testify that
He was never visible, according to the word of Christ: “No man knoweth
the Father, save the Son.” <span id="fr_3062"></span>[3063](#fn_3062)
For even in the Old Testament He had declared, “No man shall see me, and
live.” <span id="fr_3063"></span>[3064](#fn_3063) He means that the
Father is invisible, in whose authority and in whose name was He God who
appeared as the Son of God. But with us <span
id="fr_3064"></span>[3065](#fn_3064) Christ is received in the person of
Christ, because even in this manner is He our *God*. Whatever attributes
therefore you require as worthy of God, must be found in the Father, who
is invisible and unapproachable, and placid, and (so to speak) the God
of the philosophers; whereas those qualities which you censure as
unworthy must be supposed to be in the Son, who has been seen, and
heard, and encountered, the Witness and Servant of the Father, uniting
in Himself man and God, God in mighty deeds, in weak ones man, in order
that He may give to man as much as He takes from God. What in your
esteem is the entire disgrace of my God, is in fact the sacrament of
man’s salvation. God held converse with man, that man might learn to act
as God. God dealt on equal terms <span
id="fr_3065"></span>[3066](#fn_3065) with man, that man might be able to
deal on equal terms with God. God was found little, that man might
become very great. You who disdain such a God, I hardly know whether you
*ex fide*believe that God was crucified. How great, then, is your
perversity in respect of the two characters of the Creator! You
designate Him as *Judge*, and reprobate as cruelty that severity of the
Judge which only acts in accord with the merits of cases. You require
God to be *very good*, and yet despise as meanness that gentleness of
His which accorded with His kindness, (and) held lowly converse in
proportion to the mediocrity of man’s estate. He pleases you not,
whether great or little, neither as your judge nor as your friend! What
if the same features should be discovered in your God? That *He* too is
a judge, we have already shown in the proper section: <span
id="fr_3066"></span>[3067](#fn_3066) that from being a judge He must
needs be severe; and from being severe He must also be cruel, if indeed
cruel. <span id="fr_3067"></span>[3068](#fn_3067)

<span id="v.iv.iii.xxvii-p21"></span> This doctrine of theology is more
fully expressed by our author in a fine passage in his *Treatise against
Praxeas*, xvi. (Oehler, vol. ii. p. 674), of which the translator gave
this version in Bp. Bull’s *Def. Nic. Creed*, vol. i. p. 18: “The Son
hath executed judgment from the beginning, throwing down the haughty
tower, and dividing the tongues, punishing the whole world by the
violence of waters, raining upon Sodom and Gomorrha fire and brimstone
‘the <span class="sc"><span id="v.iv.iii.xxvii-p21.2"></span>Lord</span>
from the <span class="sc"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xxvii-p21.3"></span>Lord</span>.’  For he it was who at all
times came down to hold converse with men, from Adam on to the
patriarchs and the prophets, in vision, in dream, in mirror, in dark
saying; ever from the beginning laying the foundation of the course (of
His dispensations), which He meant to follow out unto the end. Thus was
He ever learning (practising or rehearsing); and the God who conversed
with men upon earth could be no other than the Word, which was to be
made flesh.  But He was thus learning (or rehearsing, *ediscebat*) in
order to level for us the way of faith, that we might the more readily
believe that the Son of God had come down into the world, if we knew
that in times past also something similar had been done.” The original
thus opens: “Filius itaque est qui ab initio *judicavit*.” This the
author connects with [John 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#035),
[Matt. 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018), [John
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022)<span
id="v.iv.iii.xxvii-p21.4"></span>. The “*judgment*” is dispensational
from the first to the last.  Every *judicial* function of God’s
providence from Eden to the judgment day is administered by the Son of
God. This office of *judge* has been largely dealt with in its general
view by Tertullian, in this book ii. against Marcion (see chap.
xi.–xvii.).
