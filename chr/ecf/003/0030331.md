<span id="v.iv.ii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Not Enough, as the
Marcionites Pretend, that the Supreme God Should Rescue Man; He Must
Also Have Created Him. The Existence of God Proved by His Creation, a
Prior Consideration to His Character.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xvii-p2"></span>Pressed by these arguments, they
exclaim: One work is sufficient for our god; he has delivered man by his
supreme and most excellent goodness, which is preferable to (the
creation of) all the locusts. <span id="fr_2525"></span>[2526](#fn_2525.md)
What superior god is this, of whom it has not been possible to find any
work so great as *the man* of the lesser god! Now without doubt the
first thing you have to do is to prove that he exists, after the same
manner that the existence of God must ordinarily be proved—by his works;
and only after that by his good deeds. For the first question is,
Whether he exists? and then, What is his character? The former is to be
tested <span id="fr_2526"></span>[2527](#fn_2526.md) by his works, the
other by the beneficence of them. It does not simply follow that he
exists, because he is said to have wrought deliverance for man; but only
after it shall have been settled that he exists, will there be room for
saying that he has affected this liberation. And even this point also
must have its own evidence, because it may be quite possible both that
he has existence, and yet has not wrought the alleged deliverance. Now
in that section of our work which concerned the question of the unknown
god, two points were made clear enough—both that he had created
nothing:  and that he ought to have been a creator, in order to be known
by his works; because, if he had existed, he ought to have been known,
and that too from the beginning of things; for it was not fit that God
should have lain hid. It will be necessary that I should revert to the
very trunk of that question of the unknown god, that I may strike off
into some of its other branches also. For it will be first of all proper
to inquire, Why he, who afterwards brought himself into notice, did
so—so late, and not at the very first? From creatures, with which as God
he was indeed so closely connected (and the closer this connection
was, <span id="fr_2527"></span>[2528](#fn_2527.md) the greater was his
goodness), he ought never to have been hidden. For it cannot be
pretended that there was not either any means of arriving at the
knowledge of God, or a good reason for it, when from the beginning man
was in the world, for whom the deliverance is now come; as was also that
malevolence of the Creator, in opposition to which the good God has
wrought the deliverance. He was therefore either ignorant of the good
reason for and means of his own necessary manifestation, or doubted
them; or else was either unable or unwilling to encounter them. All
these alternatives are unworthy of God, especially the supreme <span
id="page_284">p. 284</span> <span id="v.iv.ii.xvii-Page_284"></span>and
best. This topic, <span id="fr_2528"></span>[2529](#fn_2528.md) however, we
shall afterwards <span id="fr_2529"></span>[2530](#fn_2529.md) more fully
treat, with a condemnation of the tardy manifestation; we at present
simply point it out.

mightier things to the good and supreme God.  See St. Jerome’s *Proem.
