id="v.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—The Formation of Man by the
Demiurge. Human Flesh Not Made of the Ground, But of a Nondescript
Philosophic Substance.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxiv-p2"></span>Such being their conceits respecting God,
or, if you like, <span id="fr_6842"></span>[6843](#fn_6842.md) the gods, of
what sort are their figments concerning man? For, after he had made the
world, the Demiurge turns his hands to man, and chooses for him as his
substance not any portion of “the dry land,” as they say, of which alone
we have any knowledge (although it was, at that time, not yet dried by
the waters becoming separated from the earthy residuum, and only
afterwards became dry), but of the invisible substance of that matter,
which philosophy indeed dreams of, from its fluid and fusible
composition, the origin of which I am unable to imagine, because it
exists nowhere. Now, since fluidity and fusibility are qualities of
liquid matter, and since everything liquid flowed from Sophia’s tears,
we must, as a necessary conclusion, believe that muddy earth is
constituted of Sophia’s eye-rheums and viscid discharges, <span
id="fr_6843"></span>[6844](#fn_6843.md) which are just as much the dregs of
tears as mud is the sediment of waters. Thus does the Demiurge mould man
as a potter does his clay, and animates him with his own breath. Made
after his image and likeness, he will therefore be both material and
animal. A fourfold being! For in respect of his “image,” he must be
deemed clayey, <span id="fr_6844"></span>[6845](#fn_6844.md) that is to
say, material, although the Demiurge is not composed of matter; but as
to his “likeness,” he is animal, for such, too, is the Demiurge. You
have two (of his constituent elements). Moreover, a coating of flesh
was, as they allege, afterwards placed over the clayey substratum, and
it is this tunic of skin which is susceptible of sensation.
