id="v.vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—First Part of the Subject,
Touching the Constitution of the Pleroma, Briefly Recapitulated. 
Transition to the Other Part, Which is Like a Play Outside the
Curtain.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xiii-p2"></span>In this series, then, is contained the
first emanation of Æons, who are alike born, and are married, and
produce offspring: there are the most dangerous fortunes of Sophia in
her ardent longing for the Father, the most seasonable help of Horos,
the expiation of her <span id="page_511">p. 511</span> <span
id="v.vi.xiii-Page_511"></span>Enthymesis and accruing Passion, the
instruction of Christ and the Holy Spirit, their tutelar reform of the
Æons, the piebald ornamentation of Soter, the consubstantial
retinue <span id="fr_6762"></span>[6763](#fn_6762.md) of the angels. All
that remains, according to you, is the fall of the curtain and the
clapping of hands. <span id="fr_6763"></span>[6764](#fn_6763.md) What
remains in my opinion, however, is, that you should hear and take heed.
At all events, these things are said to have been played out within the
company of the Pleroma, the first scene of the tragedy.  The rest of the
play, however, is beyond the curtain—I mean outside of the Pleroma. And
yet if it be such within the bosom of the Father, within the embrace of
the guardian Horos, what must it be outside, in free space, <span
id="fr_6764"></span>[6765](#fn_6764.md) where God did not exist?

<span id="v.vi.xiii-p3"></span> Comparaticium antistatum. The latter
word Oehler explains, “ante ipsum stantes;” the former, “quia genus
eorum comparari poterat substantiæ Soteris” (so Rigaltus).

<span id="v.vi.xiii-p4"></span> The reader will see how obviously this
is meant in Tertullian’s “Quod superest, inquis, vos valete et
plaudite.” This is the well-known allusion to the end of the play in the
old Roman theatre. See Quintilian, vi. 1, 52; comp. Horace, *A. P.* 155.
Tertullian’s own parody to this formula, immediately after, is: “Immo
quod superest, inquam, vos audite et proficite.

<span id="v.vi.xiii-p5"></span> In libero: which may be, however,
“beyond the control of Horos.”
