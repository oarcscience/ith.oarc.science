<span id="v.iii.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—Heretics Work to Pull Down and
to Destroy, Not to Edify and Elevate. Heretics Do Not Adhere Even to
Their Own Traditions, But Harbour Dissent Even from Their Own
Founders.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xlii-p2"></span>But what shall I say concerning the
ministry of the word, since they make it their business not to convert
the heathen, but to subvert our people?  This is rather the glory which
they catch at, to compass the fall of those who stand, not the raising
of those who are down. Accordingly, since the very work which they
purpose to themselves comes not from the building up of their own
society, but from the demolition of the truth, they undermine our
edifices, that they may erect their own. Only <span id="page_264">p.
264</span> <span id="v.iii.xlii-Page_264"></span>deprive them of the law
of Moses, and the prophets, and the divinity of the Creator, and they
have not another objection to talk about. The consequence is, that they
more easily accomplish the ruin of standing houses than the erection of
fallen ruins. It is only when they have such objects in view that they
show themselves humble and bland and respectful. Otherwise they know no
respect even for their own leaders.  Hence it is \[supposed\] that
schisms seldom happen among heretics, because, even when they exist,
they are not obvious. <span id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288) Their
very unity, however, <span id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289) is
schism. I am greatly in error if they do not amongst themselves swerve
even from their own regulations, forasmuch as every man, just as it
suits his own temper, modifies the traditions he has received after the
same fashion as the man who handed them down did, when he moulded them
according to his own will.  The progress of the matter is an
acknowledgment at once of its character and of the manner of its birth.
That was allowable to the Valentinians which had been allowed to
Valentinus; that was also fair for the Marcionites which had been done
by Marcion—even to innovate on the faith, as was agreeable to their own
pleasure. In short, all heresies, when thoroughly looked into, are
detected harbouring dissent in many particulars even from their own
founders. The majority of them have not even churches. <span
id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290) Motherless, houseless, creedless,
outcasts, they wander about in their own essential worthlessness. <span
id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291)

<span id="v.iii.xlii-p5"></span> Hence the saying, “Wasps make combs, so
Marcionites make churches” (see our *Anti-Marcion*, p. 187); describing
the strangeness and uselessness of the societies, not (as Gibbon said)
their number (Dodgson).

pronounced corrupt by Oehler, has “quasi sibi latæ vagantur,” *q.d*.
“All for themselves, as it were, they wander” etc. (Dodgson).
