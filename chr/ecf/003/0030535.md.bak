<span id="v.vi.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX—The Demiurge Works Away at Creation,
as the Drudge of His Mother Achamoth, in Ignorance All the While of the
Nature of His Occupation.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xx-p2"></span>The Demiurge therefore, placed as he was
without the limits of the Pleroma in the ignominious solitude of his
eternal exile, founded a new empire—this world (of ours)—by clear<span
id="page_514">p. 514</span> <span id="v.vi.xx-Page_514"></span>ing away
the confusion and distinguishing the difference between the two
substances which severally constituted it, <span
id="fr_6815"></span>[6816](#fn_6815.md) the animal and the material. Out of
incorporeal (elements) he constructs bodies, heavy, light, erect <span
id="fr_6816"></span>[6817](#fn_6816.md) and stooping, celestial and
terrene. He then completes the sevenfold stages of heaven itself, with
his own throne above all. Whence he had the additional name of Sabbatum
from the hebdomadal nature of his abode; his mother Achamoth, too, had
the title Ogdoada, after the precedent of the primeval Ogdoad. <span
id="fr_6817"></span>[6818](#fn_6817.md) These heavens, however, they
consider to be intelligent, <span id="fr_6818"></span>[6819](#fn_6818.md)
and sometimes they make angels of them, as indeed they do of the
Demiurge himself; as also (they call) Paradise the fourth archangel,
because they fix it above the third heaven, of the power of which Adam
partook, when he sojourned there amidst its fleecy clouds <span
id="fr_6819"></span>[6820](#fn_6819.md) and shrubs. <span
id="fr_6820"></span>[6821](#fn_6820.md) Ptolemy remembered perfectly well
the prattle of his boyhood, <span id="fr_6821"></span>[6822](#fn_6821.md)
that apples grew in the sea, and fishes on the tree; after the same
fashion, he assumed that nut-trees flourished in the skies.  The
Demiurge does his work in ignorance, and therefore perhaps he is unaware
that trees ought to be planted only on the ground. His mother, of
course, knew all about it: how is it, then, that she did not suggest the
fact, since she was actually executing her own operation? But whilst
building up so vast an edifice for her son by means of those works,
which proclaim him at once to be father, god and, king before the
conceits of the Valentinians, why she refused to let them be known to
even him, <span id="fr_6822"></span>[6823](#fn_6822.md) is a question which
I shall ask afterwards.
