<span id="iv.iii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p2"></span>Others of your writers, in their
wantonness, even minister to your pleasures by vilifying the gods.
Examine those charming farces of your Lentuli and Hostilii, whether in
the jokes and tricks it is the buffoons or the deities which afford you
merriment; such farces I mean as Anubis the Adulterer, and Luna of the
masculine gender, and Diana under the lash, and the reading the will of
Jupiter deceased, and the three famishing Herculeses held up to
ridicule. Your dramatic literature, too, depicts all the vileness of
your gods.  The Sun mourns his offspring <span
id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) cast down from heaven, and you are full
of glee; Cybele sighs after the scornful swain, <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) and you do not blush; you brook the stage
recital of Jupiter’s misdeeds, and the shepherd <span
id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md) judging Juno, Venus, and Minerva. Then,
again, when the likeness of a god is put on the head of an ignominious
and infamous wretch, when one impure and trained up for the art in all
effeminacy, represents a Minerva or a Hercules, is not the majesty of
your gods insulted, and their deity dishonored? Yet you not merely look
on, but applaud. You are, I suppose, more devout in the arena, where
after the same fashion your deities dance on human blood, on the
pollutions caused by inflicted punishments, as they act their themes and
stories, doing their turn for the wretched criminals, except that these,
too, often put on divinity and actually play the very gods. We have seen
in our day a representation of the mutilation of Attis, that famous god
of Pessinus, and a man burnt alive as Hercules. We have made merry amid
the ludicrous cruelties of the noonday exhibition, at Mercury examining
the bodies of the dead with his hot iron; we have witnessed Jove’s
brother, <span id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md) mallet in hand, dragging
out the corpses of the gladiators. But who can go into everything of
this sort? If by such things as these the honour of deity is assailed,
if they go to blot out every trace of its majesty, we must explain them
by the contempt in which the gods are held, alike by those who actually
do them, and by those for whose enjoyment they are done. This it will be
said, however, is all in sport. But if I add—it is what all know and
will admit as readily to be the fact—that in the temples adulteries are
arranged, that at the altars pimping is practised, that often in the
houses of the temple-keepers and priests, under the sacrificial fillets,
and the sacred hats, <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md) and the purple
robes, amid the fumes of incense, deeds of licentiousness are done, I am
not sure but your gods have more reason to complain of you than of
Christians. It is certainly among the votaries of your religion that the
perpetrators of sacrilege are always found, for Christians do not enter
your temples even in the day-time. Perhaps they too would be spoilers of
them, if they worshipped in them. What then do they worship, since their
objects of worship are different from yours? Already indeed it is
implied, as the corollary from their rejection of the lie, that they
render homage to the truth; nor continue longer in an error which they
have given up in the very fact of recognizing it to be an error.  Take
this in first of all, and when we have offered a preliminary refutation
of some false opinions, go on to derive from it our entire religious
system.
