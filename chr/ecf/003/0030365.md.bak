<span id="v.iv.iii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—The Law of the Sabbath-Day
Explained. The Eight Days’ Procession Around Jericho. The Gathering of
Sticks a Violation.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xxi-p2"></span>Similarly on other points also, you
reproach Him with fickleness and instability for contradictions in His
commandments, such as that He forbade work to be done on Sabbath-days,
and yet at the siege of Jericho ordered the ark to be carried round the
walls during eight days; in other words, of course, actually on a
Sabbath. You do not, however, consider the law of the Sabbath: they are
human works, not divine, which it prohibits. <span
id="fr_2958"></span>[2959](#fn_2958.md) For it says, “Six days shalt thou
labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of <span
id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span id="v.iv.iii.xxi-Page_314"></span>the
Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work.” What work?  Of course
your own. The conclusion is, that from the Sabbath-day He removes those
works which He had before enjoined for the six days, that is, your own
works; in other words, human works of daily life. Now, the carrying
around of the ark is evidently not an ordinary daily duty, nor yet a
human one; but a rare and a sacred work, and, as being then ordered by
the direct precept of God, a divine one. And I might fully explain what
this signified, were it not a tedious process to open out the
forms <span id="fr_2959"></span>[2960](#fn_2959.md) of all the Creator’s
proofs, which you would, moreover, probably refuse to allow. It is more
to the point, if you be confuted on plain matters <span
id="fr_2960"></span>[2961](#fn_2960.md) by the simplicity of truth rather
than curious reasoning. Thus, in the present instance, there is a clear
distinction respecting the Sabbath’s prohibition of human labours, not
divine ones. Accordingly, the man who went and gathered sticks on the
Sabbath-day was punished with death. For it was his own work which he
did; and this <span id="fr_2961"></span>[2962](#fn_2961.md) the law
forbade. They, however, who on the Sabbath carried the ark round
Jericho, did it with impunity. For it was not their own work, but God’s,
which they executed, and that too, from His express commandment.
