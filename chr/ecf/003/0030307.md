<span id="v.iii.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLI.—The Conduct of Heretics: Its
Frivolity, Worldliness, and Irregularity. The Notorious Wantonness of
Their Women.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xli-p2"></span>I must not omit an account of the
conduct <span id="fr_2277"></span>[2278](#fn_2277.md) also of the
heretics—how frivolous it is, how worldly, how merely human, without
seriousness, without authority, without discipline, as suits their
creed. To begin with, it is doubtful who is a catechumen, and who a
believer; they have all access alike, they hear alike, they pray
alike—even heathens, if any such happen to come among them. “That which
is holy they will cast to the dogs, and their pearls,” although (to be
sure) they are not real ones, “they will fling to the swine.” <span
id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278.md) Simplicity they will have to
consist in the overthrow of discipline, attention to which on our part
they call brothelry. <span id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279.md) Peace
also they huddle up <span id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280.md) anyhow
with all comers; for it matters not to them, however different be their
treatment of subjects, provided only they can conspire together to storm
the citadel of the one only Truth. All are puffed up, all offer you
knowledge.  Their catechumens are perfect before they are
full-taught. <span id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281.md) The very women
of these heretics, how wanton they are! For they are bold enough to
teach, to dispute, to enact exorcisms, to undertake <span
id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282.md) cures—it may be even to
baptize. <span id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283.md) Their ordinations,
are carelessly administered, <span id="fr_2284"></span>[2285](#fn_2284.md)
capricious, changeable. <span id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285.md) At
one time they put *novices* in office; at another time, men who are
bound to some secular employment; <span
id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286.md) at another, persons who have
apostatized from us, to bind them by vainglory, since they cannot by the
truth. Nowhere is promotion easier than in the camp of rebels, where the
mere fact of being there is a foremost service. <span
id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md) And so it comes to pass that to-day
one man is their bishop, to-morrow another; to-day he is a deacon who
to-morrow is a reader; to-day he is a presbyter who tomorrow is a
layman. For even on laymen do they impose the functions of priesthood.
