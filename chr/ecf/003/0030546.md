<span id="v.vi.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—At the Last Day Great Changes
Take Place Amongst the Æons as Well as Among Men. How Achamoth and the
Demiurge are Affected Then. Irony on the Subject.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxi-p2"></span>It remains that we say something about
the end of the world, <span id="fr_6892"></span>[6893](#fn_6892.md) and the
dispensing of reward. As soon as Achamoth has completed the full harvest
of her seed, and has then proceeded to gather it into her garner, or,
after it has been taken to the mill and ground to flour, has hidden it
in the kneading-trough with yeast until the whole be leavened, then
shall the end speedily come. <span id="fr_6893"></span>[6894](#fn_6893.md)
Then, to begin with, Achamoth herself removes from the middle
region, <span id="fr_6894"></span>[6895](#fn_6894.md) from the second stage
to the highest, since she is restored to the Pleroma: she is immediately
received by that paragon of perfection <span
id="fr_6895"></span>[6896](#fn_6895.md) Soter, as her spouse of course, and
they two afterwards consummate <span
id="fr_6896"></span>[6897](#fn_6896.md) new nuptials. This must be the
spouse of the Scripture, <span id="fr_6897"></span>[6898](#fn_6897.md) the
Pleroma of espousals (for you might suppose that the Julian laws <span
id="fr_6898"></span>[6899](#fn_6898.md) were interposing, since there are
these migrations from place to place). In like manner, the Demiurge,
too, will then change the scene of his abode from the celestial
Hebdomad <span id="fr_6899"></span>[6900](#fn_6899.md) to the higher
regions, to his mother’s now vacant saloon <span
id="fr_6900"></span>[6901](#fn_6900.md) —by this time knowing her, without
however seeing her. (A happy coincidence!) For if he had caught a glance
of her, he would have preferred never to have known her.
