id="v.viii.lxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXII.—Our Destined Likeness to the
Angels in the Glorious Life of the Resurrection.</span>

<span id="v.viii.lxii-p2"></span>To this discussion, however, our Lord’s
declaration puts an effectual end:  “They shall be,” says He, “equal
unto the angels.” <span id="fr_7751"></span>[7752](#fn_7751.md) As by not
marrying, because of not dying, so, of course, by not having to yield to
any like necessity of our bodily state; even as the angels, too,
sometimes. were “equal unto” men, by eating and drinking, and submitting
their feet to the washing of the bath—having clothed themselves in human
guise, without the loss of their own intrinsic nature. If therefore
angels, when they became as men, submitted in their own unaltered
substance of spirit to be treated as if they were flesh, why shall not
men in like manner, when they become “equal unto the angels,” undergo in
their unchanged substance of flesh the treatment of spiritual beings, no
more exposed to the usual solicitations of the flesh in their angelic
garb, than were the angels once to those of the spirit when encompassed
in human form? We shall not therefore cease to continue in the flesh,
because we cease to be importuned by the usual wants of the flesh; just
as the angels ceased not therefore to remain in their spiritual
substance, because of the suspension of their spiritual incidents.
Lastly, Christ said not, “They shall be angels,” in order not to repeal
their existence as men; but He said, “They shall be equal unto the
angels,” <span id="fr_7752"></span>[7753](#fn_7752.md) that He might
preserve their humanity unimpaired. When He ascribed an angelic likeness
to the flesh, <span id="fr_7753"></span>[7754](#fn_7753.md) He took not
from it its proper substance.
