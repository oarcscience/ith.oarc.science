<span id="vi.iii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Of Preparation For, and Conduct
After, the Reception of Baptism.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xx-p2"></span>They who are about to enter baptism ought
to pray with repeated prayers, fasts, and bendings of the knee, and
vigils all the night through, and with the confession of all by- <span
id="page_679">p. 679</span> <span id="vi.iii.xx-Page_679"></span>gone
sins, that they may express *the meaning* even of the baptism of John:
“They were baptized,” saith (the Scripture), “confessing their own
sins.” <span id="fr_8743"></span>[8744](#fn_8743) To us it is matter for
thankfulness if we do *now* publicly confess our iniquities or our
turpitudes: <span id="fr_8744"></span>[8745](#fn_8744) for we do at the
same time both make satisfaction <span
id="fr_8745"></span>[8746](#fn_8745) for our former sins, by
mortification of our flesh and spirit, and lay beforehand the foundation
of defences against the temptations which will closely follow. “Watch
and pray,” saith (the Lord), “lest ye fall into temptation.” <span
id="fr_8746"></span>[8747](#fn_8746) And the reason, I believe, why they
*were* tempted was, that they fell asleep; so that they deserted the
Lord when apprehended, and he who continued to stand by Him, and used
the sword, even denied Him thrice: for withal the word had gone before,
that “no one *un*tempted should attain the celestial kingdoms.” <span
id="fr_8747"></span>[8748](#fn_8747) The Lord Himself forthwith after
*baptism* <span id="fr_8748"></span>[8749](#fn_8748) temptations
surrounded, when in forty days He had kept fast. “Then,” some one will
say, “it becomes *us*, too, rather to fast *after* baptism.” <span
id="fr_8749"></span>[8750](#fn_8749) Well, and who forbids you, unless
it be the necessity for joy, and the thanksgiving for salvation? But so
far as I, with my poor powers, understand, the Lord figuratively
retorted upon Israel the reproach *they had cast on the Lord*. <span
id="fr_8750"></span>[8751](#fn_8750) For the people, after crossing the
sea, and being carried about in the desert during forty years, although
they were there nourished with divine supplies, nevertheless were more
mindful of their belly and their gullet than of God. Thereupon the Lord,
driven apart into desert places after baptism, <span
id="fr_8751"></span>[8752](#fn_8751) showed, by maintaining a fast of
forty days, that the man of God lives “not by bread alone,” but “by the
word of God;” <span id="fr_8752"></span>[8753](#fn_8752) and that
temptations incident to fulness or immoderation of appetite are
shattered by abstinence. Therefore, blessed *ones*, whom the grace of
God awaits, when you ascend from that most sacred font <span
id="fr_8753"></span>[8754](#fn_8753) of your new birth, and spread your
hands <span id="fr_8754"></span>[8755](#fn_8754) for the first time in
the house of your mother, <span id="fr_8755"></span>[8756](#fn_8755)
together with your brethren, ask from the Father, ask from the Lord,
that His own specialties of grace *and* distributions of gifts <span
id="fr_8756"></span>[8757](#fn_8756) may be supplied you. “Ask,” saith
He, “and ye shall receive.” <span id="fr_8757"></span>[8758](#fn_8757)
Well, you *have* asked, and have received; you *have* knocked, and it
has been opened to you.  Only, I pray that, when you are asking, you be
mindful likewise of Tertullian the sinner. <span
id="fr_8758"></span>[8759](#fn_8758)

occasionally restored the spirit of a sentence, by removing them.\]
