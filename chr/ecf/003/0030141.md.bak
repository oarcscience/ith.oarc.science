id="iv.viii.i.i-p7.1"></span>Chapter I. <span
id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md) —The Hatred Felt by the Heathen
Against the Christians is Unjust, Because Based on Culpable
Ignorance.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.i-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.viii.i.i-p9.1"></span>One</span> proof of that ignorance of
yours, which condemns <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md) whilst it
excuses <span id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460.md) your injustice, is at
once apparent in the fact, that all who once shared in your ignorance
and hatred (of the Christian religion), as soon as they have come to
know it, leave off their hatred when they cease to be ignorant; nay
more, they actually themselves become what they had hated, and take to
hating what they had once been. Day after day, indeed, you groan over
the increasing number of the Christians. Your constant cry is, that the
state is beset (by us); that Christians are in your fields, in your
camps, in your islands. You grieve over it as a calamity, that each sex,
every age—in short, every rank—is passing over from you to us; yet you
do not even after this set your minds upon reflecting whether there be
not here some latent good.  You do not allow yourselves in suspicions
which may prove too true, <span id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461.md) nor do
you like ventures which may be too near the mark. <span
id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462.md) This is the only instance in which
human curiosity grows torpid. You love to be ignorant of what other men
rejoice to have discovered; you would rather not know it, because you
now cherish your hatred as if you were aware that, (with the knowledge,)
your hatred would certainly come to an end. Still, <span
id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463.md) if there shall be no just ground for
hatred, it will surely be found to be the best course to cease from the
past injustice.  Should, however, a cause have really existed there will
be no diminution of the hatred, which will indeed accumulate so much the
more in the consciousness of its justice; unless it be, forsooth, <span
id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464.md) that you are ashamed to cast off your
faults, <span id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md) or sorry to free
yourselves from blame. <span id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md) I know
very well with what answer you usually meet the argument from our rapid
increase. <span id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md) That indeed must not,
you say, be hastily accounted a good thing which converts a great number
of persons, and gains them over to its side. I am aware how the mind is
apt to take to evil courses. How many there are which forsake virtuous
living!  How many seek refuge in the opposite!  Many, no doubt; <span
id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md) nay, very many, as the last days
approach. <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) But such a comparison
as this fails in fairness of application; for all are agreed in thinking
thus of the evil-doer, so that not even the guilty themselves, who take
the wrong side, and turn away from the pursuit of good to perverse ways,
are bold enough to defend evil as good. <span
id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) Base things excite their fear, impious
ones their shame. In short, they are eager for concealment, they shrink
from publicity, they tremble when caught; when accused, they deny; even
when tortured, they do not readily or invariably confess (their crime);
at all events, <span id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) they grieve when
they are condemned.  They reproach themselves for their past life; their
change from innocence to an evil disposition they even attribute to
fate. They cannot say that it is not a wrong thing, therefore they will
not admit it to be their own act. As for the Christians, however, in
what does their case resemble this? No one is ashamed; no one is sorry,
except for his former (sins). <span id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) If
he is pointed <span id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.i-Page_110"></span>at (for his religion), he glories in
it; if dragged to trial, he does not resist; if accused, he makes no
defence. When questioned, he confesses; when condemned, he rejoices.
What sort of evil is this, in which the nature of evil comes to a
standstill? <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md)

<span id="iv.viii.i.i-p3"></span> \[As a *recapitulation* I insert this
here to close this class of argument for the reasons following.\] This
treatise resembles *The Apology*, both in its general purport as a
vindication of Christianity against heathen prejudice, and in many of
its expressions and statements. So great is the resemblance that this
shorter work has been thought by some to have been a first draft of the
longer and perfect one. Tertullian, however, here addresses his
expostulations to the general public, while in *The Apology* it is the
rulers and magistrates of the empire whom he seeks to influence. \[Dr.
Allix conjectures the date of this treatise to be about <span
