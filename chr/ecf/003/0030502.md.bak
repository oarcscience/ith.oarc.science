<span id="v.v.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—Statement of the True
Doctrine Concerning Matter. Its Relation to God’s Creation of the
World.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxxiii-p2"></span>But although Hermogenes finds it amongst
his own colourable pretences <span id="fr_6481"></span>[6482](#fn_6481.md)
(for it was not in his power to discover it in the Scriptures of God),
it is enough for us, both that it is certain that all things were made
by God, and that there is no certainty whatever that they were made out
of Matter. And even if Matter had *previously* existed, we must have
believed that it had been really made by God, since we maintained (no
less) when we held the rule of faith to be, <span
id="fr_6482"></span>[6483](#fn_6482.md) that nothing except God was
uncreated. <span id="fr_6483"></span>[6484](#fn_6483.md) Up to this point
there is room for controversy, until Matter is brought to the test of
the Scriptures, and fails to make good its case. <span
id="fr_6484"></span>[6485](#fn_6484.md) The conclusion of the whole is
this: I find that there was nothing made, except out of nothing; because
that which I find was made, I know did not *once* exist. Whatever <span
id="fr_6485"></span>[6486](#fn_6485.md) was made out of something, has its
origin in something made: for instance, out of the ground was made the
grass, and the fruit, and the cattle, and the form of man himself; so
from the waters were produced the animals which swim and fly. The
original fabrics <span id="fr_6486"></span>[6487](#fn_6486.md) out of which
such creatures were produced I may call their *materials*, <span
id="fr_6487"></span>[6488](#fn_6487.md) but then even these were created by
God.
