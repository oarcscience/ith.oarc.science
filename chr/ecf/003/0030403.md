<span id="v.iv.v.iv"></span>

<span id="v.iv.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Each Side Claims to Possess the
True Gospel. Antiquity the Criterion of Truth in Such a Matter.
Marcion’s Pretensions as an Amender of the Gospel.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.iv-p2"></span>We must follow, then, the clue <span
id="fr_3560"></span>[3561](#fn_3560.md) of our discussion, meeting every
effort of our opponents <span id="page_349">p. 349</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.iv-Page_349"></span>with reciprocal vigor. I say that *my*
Gospel is the true one; Marcion, that *his* is. I affirm that Marcion’s
Gospel is adulterated; Marcion, that mine is. Now what is to settle the
point for us, except it be that principle <span
id="fr_3561"></span>[3562](#fn_3561.md) of *time*, which rules that the
authority lies with that which shall be found to be more ancient; and
assumes as an elemental truth, <span
id="fr_3562"></span>[3563](#fn_3562) that corruption (of doctrine.md)
belongs to the side which shall be convicted of comparative lateness in
its origin. <span id="fr_3563"></span>[3564](#fn_3563.md) For, inasmuch as
error <span id="fr_3564"></span>[3565](#fn_3564.md) is falsification of
truth, it must needs be that truth therefore precede error. A thing must
exist prior to its suffering any casualty; <span
id="fr_3565"></span>[3566](#fn_3565.md) and an object <span
id="fr_3566"></span>[3567](#fn_3566.md) must precede all rivalry to itself.
Else how absurd it would be, that, when we have proved our position to
be the older one, and Marcion’s the later, ours should yet appear to be
the false one, before it had even received from truth its objective
existence; <span id="fr_3567"></span>[3568](#fn_3567.md) and Marcion’s
should also be supposed to have experienced rivalry at our hands, even
before its publication; and, in fine, that that should be thought to be
the truer position which is the later one—a century <span
id="fr_3568"></span>[3569](#fn_3568.md) later than the publication of all
the many and great facts and records of the Christian religion, which
certainly could not have been published *without*, that is to say,
*before*, the truth of the gospel. With regard, then, to the
pending <span id="fr_3569"></span>[3570](#fn_3569.md) question, of Luke’s
Gospel (so far as its being the common property <span
id="fr_3570"></span>[3571](#fn_3570.md) of ourselves and Marcion enables it
to be decisive of the truth, <span id="fr_3571"></span>[3572](#fn_3571.md)
) that portion of it which we alone receive <span
id="fr_3572"></span>[3573](#fn_3572.md) is so much older than Marcion, that
Marcion himself once believed it, when in the first warmth of faith he
contributed money to the Catholic church, which along with himself was
afterwards rejected, <span id="fr_3573"></span>[3574](#fn_3573.md) when he
fell away from our truth into his own heresy. What if the Marcionites
have denied that he held the primitive faith amongst ourselves, in the
face even of his own letter? What, if they do not acknowledge the
letter? They, at any rate, receive his *Antitheses*; and more than that,
they make ostentatious use <span id="fr_3574"></span>[3575](#fn_3574.md) of
them. Proof out of these is enough for me. For if the Gospel, said to be
Luke’s which is current amongst us <span
id="fr_3575"></span>[3576](#fn_3575.md) (we shall see whether it be also
current with Marcion), is the very one which, as Marcion argues in his
*Antitheses*, was interpolated by the defenders of Judaism, for the
purpose of such a conglomeration with it of the law and the prophets as
should enable them out of it to fashion their Christ, surely he could
not have so argued about it, unless he had found it (in such a form). No
one censures things before they exist, <span
id="fr_3576"></span>[3577](#fn_3576.md) when he knows not whether they will
come to pass. Emendation never precedes the fault. To be sure, <span
id="fr_3577"></span>[3578](#fn_3577.md) an amender of that Gospel, which
had been all topsy-turvy <span id="fr_3578"></span>[3579](#fn_3578.md) from
the days of Tiberius to those of Antoninus, first presented himself in
Marcion alone—so long looked for by Christ, who was all along regretting
that he had been in so great a hurry to send out his apostles without
the support of Marcion! But for all that, <span
id="fr_3579"></span>[3580](#fn_3579.md) heresy, which is for ever mending
the Gospels, and corrupting them in the act, is an affair of man’s
audacity, not of God’s authority; and if Marcion be even a disciple, he
is yet not “above his master;” <span
id="fr_3580"></span>[3581](#fn_3580.md) if Marcion be an apostle, still as
Paul says, “Whether it be I or they, so we preach;” <span
id="fr_3581"></span>[3582](#fn_3581.md) if Marcion be a prophet, even “the
spirits of the prophets will be subject to the prophets,” <span
id="fr_3582"></span>[3583](#fn_3582.md) for they are not the authors of
confusion, but of peace; or if Marcion be actually an angel, he must
rather be designated “as anathema than as a preacher of the
gospel,” <span id="fr_3583"></span>[3584](#fn_3583.md) because it is a
strange gospel which he has preached. So that, whilst he amends, he only
confirms both positions: both that our Gospel is the prior one, for he
amends that which he has previously fallen in with; and that *that* is
the later one, which, by putting it together out of the emendations of
ours, he has made his own Gospel, and a novel one too.
