id="v.vii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Marcion, Who Would Blot Out the
Record of Christ’s Nativity, is Rebuked for So Startling a
Heresy.</span>

<span id="v.vii.ii-p2"></span>Clearly enough is the nativity announced
by Gabriel. <span id="fr_6946"></span>[6947](#fn_6946.md) But what has he
to do with the Creator’s angel? <span
id="fr_6947"></span>[6948](#fn_6947.md) The conception in the virgin’s womb
is also set plainly before us. But what concern has he with the
Creator’s prophet, Isaiah? <span id="fr_6948"></span>[6949](#fn_6948.md)
He <span id="fr_6949"></span>[6950](#fn_6949.md) will not brook delay,
since *suddenly* (without any prophetic announcement) did he bring down
Christ from heaven. <span id="fr_6950"></span>[6951](#fn_6950.md) “Away,”
says he, “with that eternal plaguey taxing of Cæsar, and the scanty inn,
and the squalid swaddling-clothes, and the hard stable. <span
id="fr_6951"></span>[6952](#fn_6951.md) We do not care a jot for <span
id="fr_6952"></span>[6953](#fn_6952.md) that multitude of the heavenly host
which praised their Lord at night. <span
id="fr_6953"></span>[6954](#fn_6953.md) Let the shepherds take better care
of their flock, <span id="fr_6954"></span>[6955](#fn_6954.md) and let the
wise men spare their legs so long a journey; <span
id="fr_6955"></span>[6956](#fn_6955.md) let them keep their gold to
themselves. <span id="fr_6956"></span>[6957](#fn_6956.md) Let Herod, too,
mend his manners, so that Jeremy may not glory over him. <span
id="fr_6957"></span>[6958](#fn_6957.md) Spare also the babe from
circumcision, that he may escape the pain thereof; nor let him be
brought into the temple, lest he burden his parents with the expense of
the offering; <span id="fr_6958"></span>[6959](#fn_6958.md) nor let him be
handed to Simeon, lest the old man be saddened at the point of
death. <span id="fr_6959"></span>[6960](#fn_6959.md) Let that old woman
also hold her tongue, lest she should bewitch the child.” <span
id="fr_6960"></span>[6961](#fn_6960.md) After such a fashion as this, I
suppose you have had, O Marcion, the hardihood of blotting out the
original records (of the history) of Christ, that His flesh may lose the
proofs of its reality. But, prithee, on what grounds (do you do this)?
Show me your authority. If you are a prophet, foretell us a thing; if
you are an apostle, open your message in public; if a follower of
apostles, <span id="fr_6961"></span>[6962](#fn_6961.md) side with apostles
in thought; if you are only a (private) Christian, believe what has been
handed down to us: if, however, you are nothing of all this, then (as I
have the best reason to say) cease to live. <span
id="fr_6962"></span>[6963](#fn_6962.md) For indeed you are already dead,
since you are no Christian, because you do not believe that which by
being believed makes men Christian,—nay, you are the more dead, the more
you are not a Christian; having fallen away, after you had been one, by
rejecting <span id="fr_6963"></span>[6964](#fn_6963.md) what you formerly
believed, even as you yourself acknowledge in a certain letter of yours,
and as your followers do not deny, whilst our (brethren) can prove
it. <span id="fr_6964"></span>[6965](#fn_6964.md) Rejecting, therefore,
what you *once* believed, you have completed the act of rejection, by
now no longer believing:  the fact, however, of your having ceased to
believe has not made your rejection of the faith right and proper; nay,
rather, <span id="fr_6965"></span>[6966](#fn_6965.md) by your act of
rejection you prove that what you believed previous to the said act was
of a different character. <span id="fr_6966"></span>[6967](#fn_6966.md)
What you believed to be of a different character, had been handed down
just as *you believed it*. Now <span
id="fr_6967"></span>[6968](#fn_6967.md) that which had been handed down was
true, inasmuch as it had been transmitted by those whose duty it was to
hand it down.  Therefore, when rejecting that which had been handed
down, you rejected that which was true. You had no authority for what
you did. However, we have already in another treatise availed ourselves
more fully of these prescriptive rules against all heresies.  Our
repetition of them hereafter that large (treatise) is superfluous, <span
id="fr_6968"></span>[6969](#fn_6968.md) when we ask the reason why you have
formed the opinion that Christ was not born.
