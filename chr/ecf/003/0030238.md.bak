id="iv.xi.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—These Vagaries Stimulated
Some Profane Corruptions of Christianity. The Profanity of Simon Magus
Condemned.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xxxiv-p2"></span>No tenet, indeed, under cover of any
heresy has as yet burst upon us, embodying any such extravagant fiction
as that the souls of human beings pass into the bodies of wild beasts;
but yet we have deemed it necessary to attack and refute this conceit,
as a consistent sequel to the preceding opinions, in order that Homer in
the peacock might be got rid of as effectually as Pythagoras in
Euphorbus; and in order that, by the demolition of the *metempsychosis*
and *metensomatosis* by the same blow, the ground might be cut away
which has furnished no inconsiderable support to our heretics. There is
the (infamous) Simon of Samaria in the Acts of the Apostles, who
chaffered for the Holy Ghost: after his condemnation by *Him*, and a
vain remorse that he and his money must perish together, <span
id="fr_1725"></span>[1726](#fn_1725.md) he applied his energies to the
destruction of the truth, as if to console himself with revenge. Besides
the support with which his own magic arts furnished him, he had recourse
to imposture, and purchased a Tyrian woman of the name of Helen out of a
brothel, with the same money which he had offered for the Holy Spirit,—a
traffic worthy of the wretched man. He actually feigned himself to be
the Supreme Father, and further pretended that the woman was his own
primary conception, wherewith he had purposed the creation of the angels
and the archangels; that after she was possessed of this purpose she
sprang forth from the Father and descended to the lower spaces, and
there anticipating the Father’s design had produced the angelic powers,
which knew nothing of the Father, the Creator of this world; that she
was detained a prisoner by these from a (rebellious) motive very like
her own, lest after her departure from them they should appear to be the
offspring of another being; and that, after being on this account
exposed to every insult, to prevent her leaving them anywhere after her
dishonour, she was degraded even to the form of man, to be confined, as
it were, in the bonds of the flesh. Having during many ages wallowed
about in one female shape and another, she became the notorious Helen
who was so ruinous to Priam, and afterwards to the eyes of Stesichorus,
whom, she blinded in revenge for his lampoons, and then restored to
sight to reward him for his eulogies. After wandering about in this way
from body to body, she, in her final disgrace, turned out a viler Helen
still as a professional prostitute. This wench, therefore, was the lost
sheep, upon whom the Supreme Father, even Simon, descended, who, after
he had recovered her and brought her back—whether on his shoulders or
loins I cannot tell—cast an eye on the salvation of man, in order to
gratify his spleen by liberating them from the angelic powers. Moreover,
to deceive these he also himself assumed a visible shape; and feigning
the appearance of a man amongst men, he acted the part of the Son in
Judea, and of the Father in Samaria. O hapless Helen, what a hard fate
is yours between the poets and the heretics, who have blackened your
fame sometimes with adultery, sometimes with prostitution!  Only her
rescue from Troy is a more glorious affair than her extrication from the
brothel. There were a thousand ships to remove her from Troy; a thousand
pence were probably more than enough to withdraw her from the stews. Fie
on you, Simon, to be so tardy in seeking her out, and so inconstant in
ransoming her! How different from Menelaus! As soon as he has lost her,
he goes in pursuit of her; she is no sooner ravished than he begins his
search; after a ten years’ conflict he boldly <span id="page_216">p.
216</span> <span id="iv.xi.xxxiv-Page_216"></span>rescues her:  there is
no lurking, no deceiving, no cavilling. I am really afraid that he was a
much better “Father,” who laboured so much more vigilantly, bravely, and
perseveringly, about the recovery of his Helen.
