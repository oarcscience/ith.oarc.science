<span id="iv.xi.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—The Pythagorean Doctrine
of Transmigration Sketched and Censured.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xxviii-p2"></span>What, then, by this time means that
ancient saying, mentioned by Plato, <span
id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702.md) concerning the reciprocal migration
of souls; how they remove hence and go thither, and then return hither
and pass through life, and then again depart from this life, and
afterwards become alive from the dead? Some will have it that this is a
saying of Pythagoras; Albinus supposes it to be a divine announcement,
perhaps of the Egyptian Mercury. <span
id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703.md) But there is no divine saying,
except of the one true God, by whom the prophets, and the apostles, and
Christ Himself declared their grand message. More ancient than Saturn a
good deal (by some nine hundred years or so), and even than his
grandchildren, is Moses; and he is certainly much more divine,
recounting and tracing out, <span id="page_209">p. 209</span> <span
id="iv.xi.xxviii-Page_209"></span>as he does, the course of the human
race from the very beginning of the world, indicating the several births
(of the fathers of mankind) according to their names and their epochs;
giving thus plain proof of the divine character of his work, from its
divine authority and word. If, indeed, the sophist of Samos is Plato’s
authority for the eternally revolving migration of souls out of a
constant alternation of the dead and the living states, then no doubt
did the famous Pythagoras, however excellent in other respects, for the
purpose of fabricating such an opinion as this, rely on a falsehood,
which was not only shameful, but also hazardous. Consider it, you that
are ignorant of it, and believe with us.  He feigns death, he conceals
himself underground, he condemns himself to that endurance for some
seven years, during which he learns from his mother, who was his sole
accomplice and attendant, what he was to relate for the belief of the
world concerning those who had died since his seclusion; <span
id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704.md) and when he thought that he had
succeeded in reducing the frame of his body to the horrid appearance of
a dead old man, he comes forth from the place of his concealment and
deceit, and pretends to have returned from the dead. Who would hesitate
about believing that the man, whom he had supposed to have died, was
come back again to life? especially after hearing from him facts about
the recently dead, <span id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705.md) which he
evidently could only have discovered in Hades itself! Thus, that men are
made alive after death, is rather an old statement. But what if it be
rather a recent one also? The truth does not desire antiquity, nor does
falsehood shun novelty. This notable saying I hold to be plainly false,
though ennobled by antiquity. How should that not be false, which
depends for its evidence on a falsehood?—How can I help believing
Pythagoras to be a deceiver, who practises deceit to win my belief? How
will he convince me that, before he was Pythagoras, he had been
Æthalides, and Euphorbus, and the fisherman Pyrrhus, and Hermotimus, to
make us believe that men live again after they have died, when he
actually perjured himself afterwards as Pythagoras. In proportion as it
would be easier for me to believe that he had returned once to life in
his own person, than so often in the person of this man and that, in the
same degree has he deceived me in things which are too hard to be
credited, because he has played the impostor in matters which might be
readily believed. Well, but he recognised the shield of Euphorbus, which
had been formerly consecrated at Delphi, and claimed it as his own, and
proved his claim by signs which were generally unknown. Now, look again
at his subterranean lurking-place, and believe his story, if you can.
For, as to the man who devised such a tricksty scheme, to the injury of
his health, fraudulently wasting his life, and torturing it for seven
years underground, amidst hunger, idleness, and darkness—with a profound
disgust for the mighty sky—what reckless effort would he not make, what
curious contrivance would he not attempt, to arrive at the discovery of
this famous shield? Suppose now, that he found it in some of those
hidden researches; suppose that he recovered some slight breath of
report which survived the now obsolete tradition; suppose him to have
come to the knowledge of it by an inspection which he had bribed the
beadle to let him have,—we know very well what are the resources of
magic skill for exploring hidden secrets: there are the *catabolic*
spirits, which floor their victims; <span
id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706.md) and the *paredral* spirits, which
are ever at their side <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707.md) to
haunt them; and the *pythonic* spirits, which entrance them by their
divination and ventriloquistic <span
id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708.md) arts. For was it not likely that
Pherecydes also, the master of our Pythagoras, used to divine, or I
would rather say rave and dream, by such arts and contrivances as these?
Might not the self-same demon have been in him, who, whilst in
Euphorbus, transacted deeds of blood? But lastly, why is it that the
man, who proved himself to have been Euphorbus by the evidence of the
shield, did not also recognise any of his former Trojan comrades? For
they, too, must by this time have recovered life, since men were rising
again from the dead.
