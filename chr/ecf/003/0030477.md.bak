<span id="v.v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—On His Own Principles,
Hermogenes Makes Matter, on the Whole, Superior to God.</span>

<span id="v.v.viii-p2"></span>Nay more, <span
id="fr_6198"></span>[6199](#fn_6198.md) he even prefers Matter to God, and
rather subjects God to it, when he will have it that God made all things
out of Matter.  For if He drew His resources from it <span
id="fr_6199"></span>[6200](#fn_6199.md) for the creation of the world,
Matter is already found to be the superior, inasmuch as it furnished Him
with the means of effecting His works; and God is thereby clearly
subjected to Matter, of which the substance was indispensable to Him.
For there is no one but requires that which he makes use of; <span
id="fr_6200"></span>[6201](#fn_6200.md) no one but is subject to the thing
which he requires, for the very purpose of being able to make use of it.
So, again, there is no one who, from using what belongs to another, is
not inferior to him of whose property he makes use; and there is no one
who imparts <span id="fr_6201"></span>[6202](#fn_6201.md) of his own for
another’s use, who is not in this respect superior to him to whose use
he lends his property. On this principle, <span
id="fr_6202"></span>[6203](#fn_6202.md) Matter itself, no doubt, <span
id="fr_6203"></span>[6204](#fn_6203.md) was not in want of God, but rather
lent itself to God, who was in want of it—rich and abundant and liberal
as it was—to one who was, I suppose, too small, and too weak, and too
unskilful, to form what He willed out of nothing. A grand service,
verily, <span id="fr_6204"></span>[6205](#fn_6204.md) did it confer on God
in giving Him means at the present time whereby He might be known to be
God, and be called Almighty—only that He is no longer Almighty, since He
is not powerful enough for this, to produce all things out of nothing.
To be sure, <span id="fr_6205"></span>[6206](#fn_6205.md) Matter bestowed
somewhat on itself also—even to get its own self acknowledged with God
as God’s co-equal, nay more, as His <span id="page_482">p. 482</span>
<span id="v.v.viii-Page_482"></span>helper; only there is this drawback,
that Hermogenes is the only man that has found out this fact, besides
the philosophers—those patriarchs of all heresy. <span
id="fr_6206"></span>[6207](#fn_6206.md) For the prophets knew nothing about
it, nor the apostles thus far, nor, I suppose, even Christ.
