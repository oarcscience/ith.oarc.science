<span id="v.viii.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLI.—The Dissolution of Our
Tabernacle Consistent with the Resurrection of Our Bodies.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xli-p2"></span>It is still the same sentiment which he
follows up in the passage in which he puts the recompense above the
sufferings: “for we know;” he says, “that if our earthly house of this
tabernacle were dissolved, we have a house not made with hands, eternal
in the heavens;” <span id="fr_7551"></span>[7552](#fn_7551.md) in other
words, owing to the fact that our flesh is undergoing dissolution
through its sufferings, we shall be provided with a home in heaven. He
remembered the award (which the Lord assigns) in the Gospel: “Blessed
are they who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven.” <span id="fr_7552"></span>[7553](#fn_7552.md) Yet, when
he thus contrasted the recompense of the reward, he did not deny the
flesh’s restoration; since the recompense is due to the same substance
to which the dissolution is attributed,—that is, of course, the flesh.
Because, however, he had called the flesh *a house*, he wished elegantly
to use the same term in his comparison of the ultimate reward; promising
to the very house, which undergoes dissolution through suffering, a
better house through the resurrection.  Just as the Lord also promises
us many mansions as of a house in His Father’s home; <span
id="fr_7553"></span>[7554](#fn_7553.md) although this may possibly be
understood of the domicile of this world, on the dissolution of whose
fabric an eternal abode is promised in heaven, inasmuch as the following
context, having a manifest reference to the flesh, seems to show that
these preceding words have no such reference. For the apostle makes a
distinction, when he goes on to say, “For in this we groan, earnestly
desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven, if so
be that being clothed we shall not be found naked;” <span
id="fr_7554"></span>[7555](#fn_7554.md) which means, before we put off the
garment of the flesh, we wish to be clothed with the celestial glory of
immortality.  Now the privilege of this favour awaits those who shall at
the coming of the Lord be found in the flesh, and who shall, owing to
the oppressions of the time of Antichrist, deserve by an instantaneous
death, <span id="fr_7555"></span>[7556](#fn_7555.md) which is accomplished
by a sudden change, to become qualified to join the rising saints; as he
writes to the Thessalonians: “For this we say unto you by the word of
the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord
shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord Himself shall
descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and
with the trump of God:  and the dead in Christ shall rise first:  then
we too shall ourselves be caught up together with them in the clouds, to
meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” <span
