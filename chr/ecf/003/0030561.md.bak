<span id="v.vii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The Doctrine of Apelles Refuted,
that Christ’s Body Was of Sidereal Substance, Not Born. Nativity and
Mortality are Correlative Circumstances, and in Christ’s Case His Death
Proves His Birth.</span>

<span id="v.vii.vi-p2"></span>But certain disciples <span
id="fr_7020"></span>[7021](#fn_7020.md) of the heretic of Pontus, compelled
to be wiser than their teacher, concede to Christ real flesh, without
effect, however, on <span id="fr_7021"></span>[7022](#fn_7021.md) their
denial of His nativity. He might have had, they say, a flesh which was
not at all born. So we have found our way “out of a frying-pan,” as the
proverb runs, “into the fire,” <span
id="fr_7022"></span>[7023](#fn_7022.md) —from Marcion to Apelles. This man
having first fallen from the principles of Marcion into (intercourse
with) a woman, in the flesh, and afterwards shipwrecked himself, in the
spirit, on the virgin Philumene, <span
id="fr_7023"></span>[7024](#fn_7023.md) proceeded from that *time* <span
id="fr_7024"></span>[7025](#fn_7024.md) to preach that the body of Christ
was of solid flesh, but without having been born. To this angel, indeed,
of Philumene, the apostle will reply in tones like those in which he
even then predicted him, saying, “Although an angel from heaven preach
any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let
him be accursed.” <span id="fr_7025"></span>[7026](#fn_7025.md) To the
arguments, however, which have been indicated just above, we have now to
show our resistance. They allow that Christ really had a body. Whence
was the material of it, if not from the same sort of thing as <span
id="fr_7026"></span>[7027](#fn_7026.md) that in which He appeared? Whence
came His body, if His body were not flesh?  Whence came His flesh, if it
were not born? Inasmuch as that which is born must undergo this nativity
in order to become flesh.  He borrowed, they say, His flesh from the
stars, and from the substances of the higher world. And they assert it
for a certain principle, that a body without nativity is nothing to be
astonished at, because it has been submitted to angels to appear even
amongst ourselves in the flesh without the intervention of the womb.  We
admit, of course, that such facts have been related. But then, how comes
it to pass that a faith which holds to a different rule borrows
materials for its own arguments from the faith which it impugns? What
has it to do with Moses, who has rejected the God of Moses? Since the
God is a different one, everything belonging to him must be different
also.  But let the heretics always use the Scriptures of that God whose
world they also enjoy. The fact will certainly recoil on them as a
witness to judge them, that they maintain their own blasphemies from
examples derived from *Him*. <span id="fr_7027"></span>[7028](#fn_7027.md)
But it is an easy task for the truth to prevail without raising any such
demurrer against them. When, therefore, they set forth the flesh of
Christ after the pattern of the angels, declaring it to be not born, and
yet flesh for all that, I should wish them to compare the causes, both
in Christ’s case and that of the angels, wherefore they came in the
flesh. Never did any angel descend for the purpose of being crucified,
of tasting death, *and* of rising again from the dead. Now, since there
never was such a reason for angels becoming embodied, you have the cause
why they assumed flesh without undergoing birth. They had not come to
die, therefore they also (came not) to be born. Christ, however, having
been sent to die, had necessarily to be also born, that He might be
capable of death; for nothing is in the habit of dying but that <span
id="page_527">p. 527</span> <span id="v.vii.vi-Page_527"></span>which is
born. Between nativity and mortality there is a mutual contrast. The
law <span id="fr_7028"></span>[7029](#fn_7028.md) which makes us die is the
cause of our being born. Now, since Christ died owing to the condition
which undergoes death, but that undergoes death which is also born, the
consequence was—nay, it was an antecedent necessity—that He must have
been born also, <span id="fr_7029"></span>[7030](#fn_7029.md) by reason of
the condition which undergoes birth; because He had to die in obedience
to that very condition which, because it begins with birth, ends in
death. <span id="fr_7030"></span>[7031](#fn_7030.md) It was not fitting for
Him not to be born under the pretence <span
id="fr_7031"></span>[7032](#fn_7031.md) that it was fitting for Him to die.
But the Lord Himself at that very time appeared to Abraham amongst those
angels without being born, and yet in the flesh without doubt, in virtue
of the before-mentioned diversity of cause.  You, however, cannot admit
this, since you do not receive that Christ, who was even then
rehearsing <span id="fr_7032"></span>[7033](#fn_7032.md) how to converse
with, and liberate, and judge the human race, in the habit of a flesh
which as yet was not born, because it did not yet mean to die until both
its nativity and mortality were previously (by prophecy) announced. Let
them, then, prove to us that those angels derived their flesh from the
stars. If they do not prove it because it is not written, neither will
the flesh of Christ get its origin therefrom, for which they borrowed
the precedent of the angels. It is plain that the angels bore a flesh
which was not naturally their own; their nature being of a spiritual
substance, although in some sense peculiar to themselves, corporeal; and
yet they could be transfigured into human shape, and for the time be
able to appear and have intercourse with men. Since, therefore, it has
not been told us whence they obtained their flesh, it remains for us not
to doubt in our minds that a property of angelic power is this, to
assume to themselves bodily shape out of no material substance. How much
more, you say, is it (within their competence to take a body) out of
some material substance? That is true enough. But there is no evidence
of this, because Scripture says nothing. Then, again, <span
id="fr_7033"></span>[7034](#fn_7033.md) how should they who are able to
form themselves into that which by nature they are not, be unable to do
this out of no material substance? If they become that which they are
not, why cannot they *so* become out of that which is not? But that
which has not existence when it comes into existence, is *made* out of
nothing. This is why it is unnecessary either to inquire or to
demonstrate what has subsequently become of their <span
id="fr_7034"></span>[7035](#fn_7034.md) bodies. What came out of nothing,
came to nothing. They, who were able to convert *themselves* into flesh
have it in their power to convert *nothing itself* into flesh. It is a
greater thing to change a nature than to make matter. But even if it
were necessary *to suppose* that angels derived their flesh from some
material substance, it is surely more credible that it was from some
earthly matter than from any kind of celestial substances, since it was
composed of so palpably terrene a quality that it fed on earthly
ailments. Suppose that even now a celestial *flesh* <span
id="fr_7035"></span>[7036](#fn_7035.md) had fed on earthly aliments,
although it was not itself earthly, in the same way that earthly flesh
actually fed on celestial aliments, although it had nothing of the
celestial nature (for we read of manna having been food for the people:
“Man,” says *the Psalmist*, “did eat angels’ bread,” <span
id="fr_7036"></span>[7037](#fn_7036) .md) yet this does not once infringe
the separate condition of the Lord’s flesh, because of His different
destination.  For One who was to be truly a man, even unto death, it was
necessary that He should be clothed with that flesh to which death
belongs. Now that flesh to which death belongs is preceded by birth.
