<span id="v.viii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—As the Flesh is a Partaker with
the Soul in All Human Conduct, So Will It Be in the Recompense of
Eternity.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xv-p2"></span>Come now, let our opponents sever the
connection of the flesh with the soul in the affairs of life, that they
may be emboldened to sunder it also in the recompense of life. Let them
deny their association in acts, that they may be fairly able to deny
also their participation in rewards. The flesh ought not to have any
share in the sentence, if it had none in the cause of it.  Let the soul
alone be called back, if it alone went away. But (nothing of the kind
ever happened); for the soul alone no more departed from life, than it
ran through alone the course from which it departed—I mean this present
life. Indeed, the soul alone is so far from conducting (the affairs of)
life, that we do not withdraw from community with the flesh even our
thoughts, however isolated they be, however unprecipitated into act by
means of the flesh; since whatever is done in man’s heart is done by the
soul in the flesh, and with the flesh, and through the flesh. The Lord
Himself, in short, when rebuking our thoughts, includes in His censures
this aspect of the flesh, (man’s heart), the citadel of the soul: “Why
think ye evil in your hearts?” <span
id="fr_7370"></span>[7371](#fn_7370.md) and again: “Whosoever looketh on a
woman, to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in
his heart.” <span id="fr_7371"></span>[7372](#fn_7371.md) So that even the
thought, without operation and without effect, is an act of the flesh. 
But if you allow that the faculty which rules the senses, and which they
call *Hegemonikon*, <span id="fr_7372"></span>[7373](#fn_7372.md) has its
sanctuary in the brain, or in the interval between the eyebrows, or
wheresoever the philosophers are pleased to locate it, the flesh will
still be the thinking place of the soul. The soul is never without the
flesh, as long as it is in the flesh. There is nothing which the flesh
does not transact in company with the soul, when without it it does not
exist. Consider carefully, too, whether the thoughts are not
administered by the flesh, since it is through the flesh that they are
distinguished and known externally. Let the soul only meditate some
design, the face gives the indication—the face being the mirror of all
our intentions.  They may deny all combination in acts, but they cannot
gainsay their co-operation in thoughts. Still they enumerate *the sins*
of the flesh; surely, then, for its sinful conduct it must be consigned
to punishment. But we, moreover, allege against them *the virtues* of
the flesh; surely also for its virtuous conduct it deserves a future
reward. Again, as it is the soul which acts and impels us in all we do,
so it is the function of the flesh to render obedience. Now we are not
permitted to suppose that God is either unjust or idle.  Unjust,
(however He would be,) were He to exclude from reward *the flesh* which
is associated in good works; and idle, were He to exempt it from
punishment, when it has been an accomplice in evil deeds: whereas human
judgment is deemed to be the more perfect, when it discovers the agents
in every deed, and neither spares *the guilty* nor grudges *the
virtuous* their full share of either punishment or praise with the
principals who employed their services.
