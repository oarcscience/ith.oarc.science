<span id="v.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Hermogenes Gives Divine Attributes
to Matter, and So Makes Two Gods.</span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p2"></span>At this point, then, I shall begin to treat
of Matter, how that, (according to Hermogenes,) <span
id="fr_6169"></span>[6170](#fn_6169.md) God compares it with Himself as
equally unborn, equally unmade, equally eternal, set forth as being
without a beginning, without an end. For what other estimate <span
id="fr_6170"></span>[6171](#fn_6170.md) of God is there than eternity? What
other condition has eternity than to have ever existed, and to exist yet
for evermore by virtue of its privilege of having neither beginning nor
end? Now, since this is the property of God, it will belong to God
alone, whose property it is—of course <span
id="fr_6171"></span>[6172](#fn_6171.md) on this ground, that if it can be
ascribed to any other being, it will no longer be the property of God,
but will belong, along with Him, to that being also to which it is
ascribed. For “although there be that are called gods” in name, “whether
in heaven or in earth, yet to us there is but one God the Father, of
whom are all things;” <span id="fr_6172"></span>[6173](#fn_6172.md) whence
the greater reason why, in our view, <span
id="fr_6173"></span>[6174](#fn_6173.md) that which is the property <span
id="fr_6174"></span>[6175](#fn_6174.md) of God ought to be regarded as
pertaining to God alone, and why (as I have already said) that should
cease to be such a property, when it is shared by another being. Now,
since He is God, it must necessarily be a unique mark of this
quality, <span id="fr_6175"></span>[6176](#fn_6175.md) that it be confined
to One. Else, what will be unique and singular, if that is not which has
nothing equal to it? What will be principal, if that is not which is
above all things, before all things, and from which all things proceed?
By possessing these He is God alone, and by His sole possession of them
He is One.  If another also shared in the possession, there would then
be as many gods as there were possessors of these attributes of God.
Hermogenes, therefore, introduces two gods: he introduces Matter as
God’s equal. God, however, must be One, because that is God which is
supreme; but nothing else can be supreme than that which is unique; and
that cannot possibly be unique which has anything equal to it; and
Matter will be equal with God when it is held to be <span
id="fr_6176"></span>[6177](#fn_6176.md) eternal.
