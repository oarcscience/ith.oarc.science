<span id="v.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—The Research After Definite Truth
Enjoined on Us. When We Have Discovered This, We Should Be
Content.</span>

<span id="v.iii.ix-p2"></span>I now purposely <span
id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955) relinquish this ground of argument.
Let it be granted, that the words, “Seek, and ye shall find,” were
addressed to all men (equally). Yet even here one’s aim is <span
id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956) carefully to determine <span
id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957) the sense of the words <span
id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958) consistently with <span
id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959) (that reason), <span
id="fr_1960"></span>[1961](#fn_1960) which is the guiding
principle <span id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961) in all
interpretation. (Now) no divine saying is so unconnected <span
id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962) <span id="page_248">p. 248</span>
<span id="v.iii.ix-Page_248"></span>and diffuse, that its *words* only
are to be insisted on, and their *connection* left undetermined. But at
the outset I lay down (this position) that there is some one, and
therefore definite, thing taught by Christ, which the Gentiles are by
all means bound to believe, and for that purpose to “seek,” in order
that they may be able, when they have “found” it, to believe.
However, <span id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963) there can be no
indefinite seeking for that which has been taught as one only definite
thing. You must “seek” until you “find,” and believe when you have
found; nor have you anything further to do but to keep what you have
believed provided you believe this besides, that nothing else is to be
believed, and therefore nothing else is to be sought, after you have
found and believed what has been taught by Him who charges you to seek
no other thing than that which He has taught. <span
id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964) When, indeed, any man doubts about
this, proof will be forthcoming, <span
id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965) that we have in our
possession <span id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966) that which was
taught by Christ.  Meanwhile, such is my confidence in our proof, that I
anticipate it, in the shape of an admonition to certain persons, not “to
seek” anything beyond what they have believed—that this is what they
ought to have sought, how to avoid <span
id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967) interpreting, “Seek, and ye shall
find,” without regard to the rule of reason.
