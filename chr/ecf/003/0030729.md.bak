<span id="vi.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Of the Unction.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p2"></span>After this, when we have issued from the
font, <span id="fr_8592"></span>[8593](#fn_8592.md) we are thoroughly
anointed with a blessed unction,—(a practice derived) from the old
discipline, wherein on entering the priesthood, *men* were wont to be
anointed with oil from a horn, ever since Aaron was anointed by
Moses. <span id="fr_8593"></span>[8594](#fn_8593.md) Whence Aaron is called
“Christ,” <span id="fr_8594"></span>[8595](#fn_8594.md) from the “chrism,”
which is “the unction;” which, when made spiritual, furnished an
appropriate name to the Lord, because He was “anointed” with the Spirit
by God the Father; as *written* in the Acts: “For truly they were
gathered together in this city <span
id="fr_8595"></span>[8596](#fn_8595.md) against Thy Holy Son whom Thou hast
anointed.” <span id="fr_8596"></span>[8597](#fn_8596.md) Thus, too, in
*our* case, the unction runs carnally, (*i.e.* on the body,) but profits
spiritually; in the same way as the *act* of baptism itself too is
carnal, in that we are plunged in water, *but* the *effect* spiritual,
in that we are freed from sins.
