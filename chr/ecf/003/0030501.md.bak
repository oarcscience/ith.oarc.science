<span id="v.v.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—The Account of the Creation in
Genesis a General One, Corroborated, However, by Many Other Passages of
the Old Testament, Which Give Account of Specific Creations. Further
Cavillings Confuted.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxxii-p2"></span>This is the answer I should give in
defence of the Scripture before us, for seeming here to set forth <span
id="fr_6455"></span>[6456](#fn_6455.md) the formation of the heaven and the
earth, as if (they were) the sole bodies *made*.  It could not but know
that there were those who would at once in the bodies understand their
several members also, and therefore it employed this concise mode of
speech. But, at the same time, it foresaw that there would be stupid and
crafty men, who, after paltering with the virtual meaning, <span
id="fr_6456"></span>[6457](#fn_6456.md) would require for the several
members a word descriptive of their formation too. It is therefore
because of such persons, that *Scripture* in other passages teaches us
of the creation of the individual parts. You have Wisdom saying, “But
before the depths was I brought forth,” <span
id="fr_6457"></span>[6458](#fn_6457.md) in order that you may believe that
the depths were also “brought forth”—that is, created—just as we create
sons also, though we “bring them forth.” It matters not whether the
depth was made or born, so that a beginning be accorded to it, which
*however* would not be, if it were subjoined <span
id="fr_6458"></span>[6459](#fn_6458.md) to matter. Of darkness, indeed, the
Lord Himself by Isaiah says, “I formed the light, and I created
darkness.” <span id="fr_6459"></span>[6460](#fn_6459.md) Of the wind <span
id="fr_6460"></span>[6461](#fn_6460.md) also Amos says, “He that
strengtheneth the thunder <span id="fr_6461"></span>[6462](#fn_6461.md) ,
and createth the wind, and declareth His Christ <span
id="fr_6462"></span>[6463](#fn_6462.md) unto men;” <span
id="fr_6463"></span>[6464](#fn_6463.md) thus showing that that wind was
created which was reckoned with the formation of the earth, which was
wafted over the waters, balancing and refreshing and animating all
things: not (as some suppose) meaning God Himself by *the spirit*, <span
id="fr_6464"></span>[6465](#fn_6464.md) on the ground that “God is a
Spirit,” <span id="fr_6465"></span>[6466](#fn_6465.md) because the waters
would not be able to bear up their Lord; but He speaks of that spirit of
which the winds consist, as He says by Isaiah, “Because my spirit went
forth from me, and I made every blast.” <span
id="fr_6466"></span>[6467](#fn_6466.md) In like manner the <span
id="page_496">p. 496</span> <span id="v.v.xxxii-Page_496"></span>same
Wisdom says of the waters, “Also when He made the fountains strong,
things which <span id="fr_6467"></span>[6468](#fn_6467.md) are under the
sky, I was fashioning <span id="fr_6468"></span>[6469](#fn_6468.md) them
along with Him.” <span id="fr_6469"></span>[6470](#fn_6469.md) Now, when we
prove that these particular things were created by God, although they
are only mentioned in Genesis, without any intimation of their having
been made, we shall perhaps receive from the other side the reply, that
these were made, it is true, <span id="fr_6470"></span>[6471](#fn_6470.md)
but out of Matter, since the very statement of Moses, “And darkness was
on the face of the deep, and the spirit of God moved on the face of the
waters,” <span id="fr_6471"></span>[6472](#fn_6471.md) refers to Matter, as
indeed do all those other Scriptures here and there, <span
id="fr_6472"></span>[6473](#fn_6472.md) which demonstrate that the separate
parts were made out of Matter. It must follow, then, <span
id="fr_6473"></span>[6474](#fn_6473.md) that as earth consisted of earth,
so also depth consisted of depth, and darkness of darkness, and the wind
and waters of wind and waters. And, as we said above, <span
id="fr_6474"></span>[6475](#fn_6474.md) Matter could not have been without
form, since it had specific parts, which were formed out of it—although
as separate things <span id="fr_6475"></span>[6476](#fn_6475.md) —unless,
indeed, they were not separate, but were the very same with those out of
which they came. For it is really impossible that those specific things,
which are set forth under the same names, should have been diverse;
because in that case <span id="fr_6476"></span>[6477](#fn_6476.md) the
operation of God might seem to be useless, <span
id="fr_6477"></span>[6478](#fn_6477.md) if it made things which existed
already; since that alone would be a creation, <span
id="fr_6478"></span>[6479](#fn_6478.md) when things came into being, which
had not been (previously) made. Therefore, to conclude, either Moses
then pointed to Matter when he wrote *the words*: “And darkness was on
the face of the deep, and the spirit of God moved on the face of the
waters;” or else, inasmuch as these specific parts *of creation* are
afterwards shown in other passages to have been made by God, they ought
to have been with equal explicitness <span
id="fr_6479"></span>[6480](#fn_6479.md) shown to have been made out of the
Matter which, *according to you*, Moses had previously mentioned; <span
id="fr_6480"></span>[6481](#fn_6480.md) or else, *finally*, if Moses
pointed to those specific parts, and not to Matter, I want to know where
Matter has been pointed out *at all*.
