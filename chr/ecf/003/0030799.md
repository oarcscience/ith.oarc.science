<span id="vi.vii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Of Patience Under Personal
Violence and Malediction.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.viii-p2"></span>We who carry about our very soul, our
very body, exposed in this world <span
id="fr_9093"></span>[9094](#fn_9093.md) to injury from all, and exhibit
patience under that injury; shall we be hurt at the loss <span
id="fr_9094"></span>[9095](#fn_9094.md) of less important things? <span
id="fr_9095"></span>[9096](#fn_9095.md) Far from a servant of Christ be
such a defilement as that the patience which has been prepared for
greater temptations should forsake him in frivolous ones. If one attempt
to provoke you by manual violence, the monition of the Lord is at hand:
“To him,” He saith, “who smiteth thee on the face, turn the other cheek
likewise.” <span id="fr_9096"></span>[9097](#fn_9096.md) Let
outrageousness <span id="fr_9097"></span>[9098](#fn_9097.md) be wearied out
by your patience.  Whatever that blow may be, conjoined <span
id="fr_9098"></span>[9099](#fn_9098.md) with pain and contumely, it <span
id="fr_9099"></span>[9100](#fn_9099.md) shall receive a heavier one from
the Lord.  You wound that outrageous <span
id="fr_9100"></span>[9101](#fn_9100.md) one more by enduring: for he will
be beaten by Him for whose sake you endure.  If the tongue’s bitterness
break out in malediction or reproach, look back at the saying, “When
they curse you, rejoice.” <span id="fr_9101"></span>[9102](#fn_9101.md) The
Lord Himself was “cursed” in the eye of the law; <span
id="fr_9102"></span>[9103](#fn_9102.md) and yet is He the only Blessed One.
Let us servants, therefore, follow our Lord closely; and be cursed
patiently, that we may be able to be blessed. If I hear with too little
equanimity some wanton or wicked word uttered against me, I must of
necessity either myself retaliate the bitterness, or else I shall be
racked with mute impatience. When, then, on being cursed, I smite (with
my tongue,) how shall I be found to have followed the doctrine of the
Lord, in which it has been delivered that “a man is defiled, <span
id="fr_9103"></span>[9104](#fn_9103.md) not by the defilements of vessels,
but of the things which are sent forth out of his mouth.” Again, *it is
said* that “impeachment <span id="fr_9104"></span>[9105](#fn_9104.md)
awaits us for every vain and needless word.” <span
id="fr_9105"></span>[9106](#fn_9105.md) It follows that, from whatever the
Lord keeps us, the same He admonishes us to bear patiently from another.
I will add (somewhat) touching the *pleasure* of patience. For every
injury, whether inflicted by tongue or hand, when it has lighted upon
patience, will be dismissed <span id="fr_9106"></span>[9107](#fn_9106.md)
with the same fate as, some weapon launched against and blunted on a
rock of most stedfast hardness. For it will wholly fall then and there
with bootless and fruitless labour; and sometimes will recoil and spend
its rage on him who sent it out, with retorted impetus. No doubt the
reason why any one hurts you is that you may be pained; because the
hurter’s enjoyment consists in the pain of the hurt. When, then, you
have upset his enjoyment by not being pained, *he* must needs he pained
by the loss of his enjoyment. Then you not only go <span
id="page_713">p. 713</span> <span
id="vi.vii.viii-Page_713"></span>unhurt away, which even alone is enough
for you; but gratified, into the bargain, by your adversary’s
disappointment, and revenged by his pain.  This is the *utility* and the
*pleasure* of patience.
