<span id="iv.xi.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—The Soul’s Supremacy.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xiii-p2"></span>It next remains to examine where lies
the supremacy; in other words, which of the two is superior to the
other, so that with which the supremacy clearly lies shall be the
essentially superior substance; <span
id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577) whilst that over which this
essentially superior substance shall have authority shall be considered
as the natural functionary of the superior substance. Now who will
hesitate to ascribe this entire authority to the soul, from the name of
which the whole man has received his own designation in common
phraseology?  How many *souls*, says the rich man, do I maintain? not
how many *minds*. The pilot’s desire, also, is to rescue so many *souls*
from shipwreck, not so many minds; the labourer, too, in his work, and
the soldier on the field of battle, affirms that he lays down his soul
(or life), not his mind. Which of the two has its perils or its vows and
wishes more frequently on men’s lips—the mind or the soul? Which of the
two are dying persons, said to have to do with the mind or the soul? In
short, philosophers themselves, and medical men, even when it is their
purpose to discourse about the mind, do in every instance inscribe on
their title-page <span id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578) and table of
contents, <span id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579) “*De Anima*” (“*A
treatise on the soul*”).  And that you may also have God’s voucher on
the subject, it is the soul which He addresses; it is the soul which He
exhorts and counsels, to turn the mind and intellect to Him. It is the
soul which Christ came to save; it is the soul which He threatens to
destroy in hell; it is the soul (or life) which He forbids being made
too much of; it is His soul, too (or life), which the good Shepherd
Himself lays down for His <span id="page_193">p. 193</span> <span
id="iv.xi.xiii-Page_193"></span>sheep. It is to the soul, therefore,
that you ascribe the supremacy; in *it* also you possess that union of
substance, of which you perceive the mind to be the instrument, not the
ruling power.
