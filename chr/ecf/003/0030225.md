<span id="iv.xi.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—As Free-Will Actuates an
Individual So May His Character Change.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xxi-p2"></span>Now, if the soul possessed this uniform
and simple nature from the beginning in Adam, previous to so many mental
dispositions (being developed out of it), it is not rendered multiform
by such various development, nor by the triple <span
id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651.md) form predicated of it in “*the
Valentinian trinity*” (that we may still keep the condemnation of that
heresy in view), for not even this nature is discoverable in Adam. What
had he that was spiritual? Is it because he prophetically declared “the
great mystery of Christ and the church?” <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652.md) “This is bone of my bone, and flesh
of my flesh: she shall be called Woman. Therefore shall a man leave his
father and mother, and he shall cleave unto his wife; and they two shall
be one flesh.” <span id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653.md) But this (gift
of prophecy) only came on him afterwards, when God infused into him the
ecstasy, or spiritual quality, in which prophecy consists. If, again,
the evil of sin was developed in him, this must not be accounted as a
*natural* disposition: it was rather produced by the instigation of the
(old) serpent as far from being incidental to his nature as it was from
being *material* in him, for we have already excluded belief in
“Matter.” <span id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654.md) Now, if neither the
spiritual element, nor what the heretics call the material element, was
properly inherent in him <span id="page_202">p. 202</span> <span
id="iv.xi.xxi-Page_202"></span>(since, if he had been created out of
matter, the germ of evil must have been an integral part of his
constitution), it remains that the one only original element of his
nature was what is called the *animal* (the principle of vitality, the
soul), which we maintain to be simple and uniform in its condition.
Concerning this, it remains for us to inquire whether, as being called
natural, it ought to be deemed subject to change. (The heretics whom we
have referred to) deny that nature is susceptible of any change, <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655.md) in order that they may be able to
establish and settle their threefold theory, or “trinity,” in all its
characteristics as to the several natures, because “a good tree cannot
produce evil fruit, nor a corrupt tree good fruit; and nobody gathers
figs of thorns, nor grapes of brambles.” <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656.md) If so, then “God will not be able
any longer to raise up from the stones children unto Abraham; nor to
make a generation of vipers bring forth fruits of repentance.” <span
id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657.md) And if so, the apostle too was in
error when he said in his epistle, “Ye were at one time darkness, (but
now are ye light in the Lord:)” <span
id="fr_1658"></span>[1659](#fn_1658.md) and, “We also were by nature
children of wrath;” <span id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659.md) and,
“Such were some of you, but ye are washed.” <span
id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660.md) The statements, however, of holy
Scripture will never be discordant with truth. A corrupt tree will never
yield good fruit, unless the better nature be grafted into it; nor will
a good tree produce evil fruit, except by the same process of
cultivation. Stones also will become children of Abraham, if educated in
Abraham’s faith; and a generation of vipers will bring forth the fruits
of penitence, if they reject the poison of their malignant nature. This
will be the power of the grace of God, more potent indeed than nature,
exercising its sway over the faculty that underlies itself within
us—even the freedom of our will, which is described as <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.xi.xxi-p12.2"></span>αὐτεξούσιος</span> (of
independent authority); and inasmuch as this faculty is itself also
natural and mutable, in whatsoever direction it turns, it inclines of
its own nature. Now, that there does exist within us naturally this
independent authority (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xi.xxi-p12.3"></span>τὸ αὐτεξούσιον</span> ), we have already
shown in opposition both to Marcion <span
id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661.md) and to Hermogenes. <span
id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662.md) If, then, the natural condition has
to be submitted to a definition, it must be determined to be
twofold—there being the category of the born and the unborn, the made
and not-made. Now that which has received its constitution by being made
or by being born, is by nature capable of being changed, for it can be
both born again and re-made; whereas that which is not-made and unborn
will remain for ever immoveable. Since, however, this state is suited to
God alone, as the only Being who is unborn and not-made (and therefore
immortal and unchangeable), it is absolutely certain that the nature of
all other existences which are born and created is subject to
modification and change; so that if the threefold state is to be
ascribed to the soul, it must be supposed to arise from the mutability
of its accidental circumstances, and not from the appointment of nature.
