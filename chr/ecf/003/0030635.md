<span id="v.viii.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIII.—Not the Soul, But the Natural
Body Which Died, is that Which is to Rise Again. The Resurrection of
Lazarus Commented on. Christ’s Resurrection, as the Second Adam,
Guarantees Our Own.</span>

<span id="v.viii.liii-p2"></span>Some, however, contend that the *soul*
is “the natural (or animate) body,” <span
id="fr_7686"></span>[7687](#fn_7686.md) with the view of withdrawing the
*flesh* from all connection with the risen body.  Now, since it is a
clear and fixed point that the body which is to rise again is that which
was sown *in death*, they must be challenged to an examination of the
very fact itself. Else let them show that the soul was sown after death;
in a word, that it underwent death,—that is, was demolished,
dismembered, dissolved in the ground, nothing of which was ever decreed
against it by God: let them display to our view its corruptibility and
dishonour (as well as) its weakness, that it may also accrue to it to
rise again in incorruption, and in glory, and in power. <span
id="fr_7687"></span>[7688](#fn_7687.md) Now in the case of Lazarus, (which
we may take as) the palmary instance of a resurrection, the flesh lay
prostrate in weakness, the flesh was almost putrid in the dishonour *of
its decay*, the flesh stank in corruption, and yet it was as *flesh*
that Lazarus rose again—with his soul, no doubt. But that soul was
incorrupt; nobody had wrapped it in its linen swathes; nobody had
deposited it in a grave; nobody had yet perceived it “stink;” nobody for
four days had seen it “sown.” Well, now, this entire condition, this
whole end of Lazarus, the flesh indeed of all men is still experiencing,
but the soul of no one.  That substance, therefore, to which the
apostle’s whole description manifestly refers, of which he clearly
speaks, must be both the natural (or animate) body when it is sown, and
the spiritual body when it is raised again. For in order that you may
understand it in this sense, he points to this same conclusion, when in
like manner, on the authority of the same passage of Scripture, he
displays to us “the first man Adam as made a living soul.” <span
id="fr_7688"></span>[7689](#fn_7688.md) Now since Adam was the first man,
since also the flesh was man prior to the soul <span
id="fr_7689"></span>[7690](#fn_7689.md) it undoubtedly follows that it was
the flesh that became the living soul. Moreover, since it was a bodily
substance that assumed this condition, it was of course the natural (or
animate) body that became the living soul. By what designation would
they have it called, except that which it became through the soul,
except that which it was not previous to the soul, except that which it
can never be after the soul, but through its resurrection? For after it
has recovered the soul, it once more becomes the natural (or animate)
body, in order that it may become a spiritual body. For it only resumes
in the resurrection the condition which it once <span id="page_587">p.
587</span> <span id="v.viii.liii-Page_587"></span>had. There is
therefore by no means the same good reason why the *soul* should be
called the natural (or animate) body, which the *flesh* has for bearing
that designation. The flesh, in fact, was a body before it was an
animate body. When the flesh was joined by the soul, <span
id="fr_7690"></span>[7691](#fn_7690.md) it then became the natural (or
animate) body.  Now, although the soul is a corporeal substance, <span
id="fr_7691"></span>[7692](#fn_7691.md) yet, as it is not an animated body,
but rather an animating one, it cannot be called the animate (or
natural) body, nor can it become that thing which it produces. It is
indeed when the soul accrues to something else that it makes that thing
animate; but unless it so accrues, how will it ever produce animation? 
As therefore the flesh was at first an animate (or natural) body on
receiving the soul, so at last will it become a spiritual body when
invested with the spirit. Now the apostle, by severally adducing this
order in Adam and in Christ, fairly distinguishes between the two
states, in the very essentials of their difference. And when he calls
Christ “the last Adam,” <span id="fr_7692"></span>[7693](#fn_7692.md) you
may from this circumstance discover how strenuously he labours to
establish throughout his teaching the resurrection of the flesh, not of
the soul. Thus, then, the first man Adam was flesh, not soul, and only
afterwards became a living soul; and the last Adam, Christ, was Adam
only because He was man, and only man as being flesh, not as being soul.
Accordingly the apostle goes on to say: “Howbeit that was not first
which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward that which
is spiritual,” <span id="fr_7693"></span>[7694](#fn_7693.md) as in the case
of the two Adams. Now, do you not suppose that he is distinguishing
between the natural body and the spiritual body in the same flesh, after
having already drawn the distinction therein in the two Adams, that is,
in the first man and in the last? For from which substance is it that
Christ and Adam have a parity with each other?  No doubt it is from
their flesh, although it may be from their soul also. It is, however, in
respect of the flesh that they are both man; for the flesh was man prior
*to the soul*. It was actually from it that they were able to take rank,
so as to be deemed—one the first, and the other the last man, or Adam.
Besides, things which are different in character are only incapable of
being arranged in the same order when their diversity is one of
substance; for when it is a diversity either in respect of place, or of
time, or of condition, they probably do admit of classification
together.  Here, however, they are called first and last, from the
substance of their (common) flesh, just as afterwards again the first
man (is said to be) of the earth, and the second of heaven; <span
id="fr_7694"></span>[7695](#fn_7694.md) but although He is “of heaven” in
respect of the spirit, He is yet man according to the flesh. Now since
it is the flesh, and not the soul, that makes an order (or
classification together) in the two Adams compatible, so that the
distinction is drawn between them of “the first man becoming a living
soul, and the last a quickening spirit,” <span
id="fr_7695"></span>[7696](#fn_7695.md) so in like manner this distinction
between them has already suggested the conclusion that the distinction
is due to the flesh; so that it is of the flesh that these words speak:
“Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is
natural, and afterward that which is spiritual.” <span
id="fr_7696"></span>[7697](#fn_7696.md) And thus, too, the same *flesh*
must be understood in a preceding passage: “That which is sown is the
natural body, and that which rises again is the spiritual body; because
that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural:  since
the first Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam a quickening
spirit.” <span id="fr_7697"></span>[7698](#fn_7697.md) It is all about man,
*and* all about the flesh because about man.

<span id="v.viii.liii-p15"></span>What shall we say then? Has not the
flesh even now (in this life) the spirit by faith? so that the question
still remains to be asked, how it is that the animate (or natural) body
can be said to be sown? Surely the flesh has received even here the
spirit—but *only its* “earnest;” <span
id="fr_7698"></span>[7699](#fn_7698.md) whereas of the soul (it has
received) not the earnest, but the full possession. Therefore it has the
name of *animate* (or natural) body, expressly because of the higher
substance of the soul (or *anima*,) in which it is sown, destined
hereafter to become, through the full possession of the spirit which it
shall obtain, the spiritual body, in which it is raised again. What
wonder, then, if it is more commonly called after the substance with
which it is fully furnished, than after that of which it has yet but a
sprinkling?

phrase *corpus animale* by “animate body,” the better to suit the
