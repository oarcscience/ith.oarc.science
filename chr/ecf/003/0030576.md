<span id="v.vii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—The Word of God Did Not Become
Flesh Except in the Virgin’s Womb and of Her Substance. Through His
Mother He is Descended from Her Great Ancestor David. He is Described
Both in the Old and in the New Testament as “The Fruit of David’s
Loins.”</span>

<span id="v.vii.xxi-p2"></span>Whereas, then, they contend that the
novelty (of Christ’s birth) consisted in this, that as the Word of God
became flesh without the seed of a human father, so there should be no
flesh of the virgin mother (assisting in the transaction), why should
not the novelty rather be confined to this, that His flesh, although not
born of seed, should yet have proceeded from flesh? I should like to go
more closely into this discussion.  “Behold,” says he, “a virgin shall
conceive in the womb.” <span id="fr_7227"></span>[7228](#fn_7227.md)
*Conceive* what? I ask. The Word of God, of course, and not the seed of
man, and in order, certainly, to bring forth a son. “For,” says he, “she
shall bring forth a son.” <span id="fr_7228"></span>[7229](#fn_7228.md)
Therefore, as the act of conception was her own, <span
id="fr_7229"></span>[7230](#fn_7229.md) so also what she brought forth was
her own, also, although the cause of conception <span
id="fr_7230"></span>[7231](#fn_7230.md) was not. If, on the other hand, the
Word became flesh of Himself, then He both conceived and brought forth
Himself, and the prophecy is stultified. For in that case a virgin did
*not* conceive, and did *not* bring forth; since whatever she brought
forth from the conception of the Word, is not her own flesh. But is this
the only statement of prophecy which will be frustrated? <span
id="fr_7231"></span>[7232](#fn_7231.md) Will not the angel’s announcement
also be subverted, that the virgin should “conceive in her womb and
bring forth a son?” <span id="fr_7232"></span>[7233](#fn_7232.md) And will
not in fact every scripture which declares that Christ had a mother? For
how could she have been His mother, unless He had been in her womb? But
then He received nothing from her womb which could make her a mother in
whose womb He had been. <span id="fr_7233"></span>[7234](#fn_7233.md) Such
a name as this <span id="fr_7234"></span>[7235](#fn_7234.md) a strange
flesh ought not *to assume*. No flesh can speak of a mother’s womb but
that which is itself the offspring of that womb; nor can any be the
offspring of the said womb if it owe its <span id="page_540">p.
540</span> <span id="v.vii.xxi-Page_540"></span>birth solely to itself.
Therefore even Elisabeth must be silent although she is carrying in her
womb the prophetic babe, which was already conscious of his Lord, and
is, moreover, filled with the Holy Ghost. <span
id="fr_7235"></span>[7236](#fn_7235.md) For without reason does she say,
“and whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to
me?” <span id="fr_7236"></span>[7237](#fn_7236.md) If it was not as her
son, but only as a stranger that Mary carried Jesus in her womb, how is
it she says, “Blessed is the fruit of thy womb”? <span
id="fr_7237"></span>[7238](#fn_7237.md) What is this fruit of the womb,
which received not its germ from the womb, which had not its root in the
womb, which belongs not to her whose is the womb, and which is no doubt
the real fruit of the womb—even Christ? Now, since He is the blossom of
the stem which sprouts from the root of Jesse; since, moreover, the root
of Jesse is the family of David, and the stem of the root is Mary
descended from David, and the blossom of the stem is Mary’s son, who is
called Jesus Christ, will not He also be the fruit?  For the blossom is
the fruit, because through the blossom and from the blossom every
product advances from its rudimental condition <span
id="fr_7238"></span>[7239](#fn_7238.md) to perfect fruit. What then?
*They*, deny to the fruit its blossom, and to the blossom its stem, and
to the stem its root; so that the root fails to secure <span
id="fr_7239"></span>[7240](#fn_7239.md) for itself, by means of the stem,
that special product which comes from the stem, even the blossom and the
fruit; for every step indeed in a genealogy is traced from the latest up
to the first, so that it is now a well-known fact that the flesh of
Christ is inseparable, <span id="fr_7240"></span>[7241](#fn_7240.md) not
merely from Mary, but also from David through Mary, and from Jesse
through David. “This fruit,” therefore, “of David’s loins,” that is to
say, of his posterity in the flesh, God swears to him that “He will
raise up to sit upon his throne.” <span
id="fr_7241"></span>[7242](#fn_7241.md) If “of David’s loins,” how much
rather is He of Mary’s loins, by virtue of whom He is in “the loins of
David?”
