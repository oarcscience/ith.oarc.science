<span id="v.ix.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Sundry Passages of St. John
Quoted, to Show the Distinction Between the Father and the Son. Even
Praxeas’ Classic Text—I and My Father are One—Shown to Be Against
Him.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xxii-p2"></span>Again, whose doctrine does He announce,
at which all were astonished? <span id="fr_8039"></span>[8040](#fn_8039.md)
Was it His own or the Father’s? So, when they were in doubt among
themselves whether He were the Christ (not as being the Father, of
course but as the Son), He says to them “You are not ignorant whence I
am; and I am not come of myself, but He that sent me is true, whom ye
know not; but I know Him, because I am from Him.” <span
id="fr_8040"></span>[8041](#fn_8040.md) He did not say, Because I myself am
He; and, I have sent mine own self: but His words are, “He hath sent
me.” When, likewise, the Pharisees sent men to apprehend Him, He says:
“Yet a little while am I with you, and (then) I go unto Him that sent
me.” <span id="fr_8041"></span>[8042](#fn_8041.md) When, however, He
declares that He is not alone, and uses these words, “but I and the
Father that sent me,” <span id="fr_8042"></span>[8043](#fn_8042.md) does He
not show that there are Two—Two, and yet inseparable? Indeed, this was
the sum and substance of what He was teaching them, that they were
inseparably Two; since, after citing the law when it affirms the truth
of two men’s testimony, <span id="fr_8043"></span>[8044](#fn_8043.md) He
adds at once: “I am one who am bearing witness of myself; and the Father
(is another,) who hath sent me, and beareth witness of me.” <span
id="fr_8044"></span>[8045](#fn_8044.md) Now, if He were one—being at once
both the Son and the Father—He certainly would not have quoted the
sanction of the law, which requires not the testimony of one, but of
two. Likewise, when they asked Him where His Father was, <span
id="fr_8045"></span>[8046](#fn_8045.md) He answered them, that they had
known neither Himself nor the Father; and in this answer He plainly told
them of *Two*, whom they were ignorant of. Granted that “if they had
known Him, they would have known the Father also,” <span
id="fr_8046"></span>[8047](#fn_8046.md) this certainly does not imply that
He was Himself both Father and Son; but that, by reason of the
inseparability of the Two, it was impossible for one of them to be
either acknowledged or unknown without the other. “He that sent me,”
says He, “is true; and I am telling the world those things which I have
heard of Him.” <span id="fr_8047"></span>[8048](#fn_8047.md) And the
Scripture narrative goes on to explain in an exoteric manner, that “they
understood not that He spake to them concerning the Father,” <span
id="fr_8048"></span>[8049](#fn_8048.md) although they ought certainly to
have known that the Father’s words were *uttered* in the Son, because
they read in Jeremiah, “And the Lord said to me, Behold, I have put my
words in thy mouth;” <span id="fr_8049"></span>[8050](#fn_8049.md) and
again in Isaiah, “The Lord hath given to me the tongue of learning that
I should understand when to speak a word in season.” <span
id="fr_8050"></span>[8051](#fn_8050.md) In accordance with which, *Christ*
Himself says: “Then shall ye know that I am He and that I am saying
nothing of my own self; but that, as my Father hath taught me, so I
speak, because He that sent me is with me.” <span
id="fr_8051"></span>[8052](#fn_8051.md) This also amounts to a proof that
they were Two, (although) undivided. Likewise, when upbraiding the Jews
in His discussion with them, because they wished to kill Him, He said,
“I speak that which I have seen with my Father, and ye do that which ye
have seen with your father;” <span id="fr_8052"></span>[8053](#fn_8052.md)
“but now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth which I
have heard of God;” <span id="fr_8053"></span>[8054](#fn_8053.md) and
again, “If God were your Father, ye would love me, for I proceeded forth
and came from God,” <span id="fr_8054"></span>[8055](#fn_8054.md) (still
they are not hereby separated, although He declares that He proceeded
forth *from the Father*. Some persons indeed seize the opportunity
afforded them in these words *to propound their heresy of His
separation*; but His coming out from God is like the ray’s procession
from the sun, and the river’s from the fountain, and the tree’s from the
seed); “I have not a devil, but I honour my Father;” <span
id="fr_8055"></span>[8056](#fn_8055.md) again, “If I honour myself, my
honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye say,
that He is your God: yet ye have not known Him, but I know Him; and if I
should say, I know Him not, I shall be a liar like unto you; but I know
Him, and keep His saying.” <span id="fr_8056"></span>[8057](#fn_8056.md)
But when He goes on to say, “*Your father* Abraham rejoiced to see my
<span id="page_618">p. 618</span> <span
id="v.ix.xxii-Page_618"></span>day; and he saw it, and was glad,” <span
id="fr_8057"></span>[8058](#fn_8057.md) He certainly proves that it was not
the Father that appeared to Abraham, but the Son. In like manner He
declares, in the case of the man *born* blind, “that He must do the
works of the Father *which had sent Him*;” <span
id="fr_8058"></span>[8059](#fn_8058.md) and after He had given the man
sight, He said to him, “Dost thou believe in the Son of God?” Then, upon
the man’s inquiring who *He* was, He proceeded to reveal Himself to him,
as that Son *of God* whom He had announced to him as the right object of
his faith. <span id="fr_8059"></span>[8060](#fn_8059.md) In a later passage
He declares that He is known by the Father, and the Father by Him; <span
id="fr_8060"></span>[8061](#fn_8060.md) adding that He was so wholly loved
by the Father, that He was laying down His life, because He had received
this commandment from the Father. <span
id="fr_8061"></span>[8062](#fn_8061.md) When He was asked by the Jews if He
were the very Christ <span id="fr_8062"></span>[8063](#fn_8062.md)
(meaning, of course, the Christ of God; for to this day the Jews expect
not the Father Himself, but the Christ of God, it being nowhere said
that the Father will come as the Christ), He said to them, “I am telling
you, and yet ye do not believe: the works which I am doing, in my
Father’s name, they actually bear witness of me.” <span
id="fr_8063"></span>[8064](#fn_8063.md) Witness of what? Of that very
thing, to be sure, of which they were making inquiry—whether He were the
Christ of God. Then, again, concerning His sheep, and (the assurance)
that no man should pluck them out of His hand, <span
id="fr_8064"></span>[8065](#fn_8064.md) He says, “My Father, which gave
them to me, is greater than all;” <span
id="fr_8065"></span>[8066](#fn_8065.md) adding immediately, “I am and my
Father are one.” <span id="fr_8066"></span>[8067](#fn_8066.md) Here, then,
they take their stand, too infatuated, nay, too blind, to see in the
first place that there is in this passage an intimation of Two
Beings—“*I and my Father*;” then that there is a plural predicate,
“*are*,” inapplicable to one person only; and lastly, that (the
predicate terminates in an abstract, not a personal noun)—“we are one
*thing*” *Unum*, not “one person” *Unus*. For if He had said “one
Person,” He might have rendered some assistance to their opinion. 
*Unus*, no doubt, indicates the singular number; but (here we have a
case where) “Two” are still the subject in the masculine gender. He
accordingly says *Unum*, a neuter term, which does not imply singularity
of number, but unity of essence, likeness, conjunction, affection on the
Father’s part, who loves the Son, and submission on the Son’s, who obeys
the Father’s will. When He says, “I and my Father are one” *in
essence*—*Unum*—He shows that there are Two, whom He puts on an equality
and unites in one. He therefore adds to this very statement, that He
“had showed them many works from the Father,” for none of which did He
deserve to be stoned. <span id="fr_8067"></span>[8068](#fn_8067.md) And to
prevent their thinking Him deserving of this fate, as if He had claimed
to be considered as God Himself, that is, the Father, by having said, “I
and my Father are One,” representing Himself as the Father’s divine Son,
and not as God Himself, He says, “If it is written in your law, I said,
Ye are gods; and if the Scripture cannot be broken, say ye of Him whom
the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, that He blasphemeth,
because He said, I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of my
Father, believe me not; but if I do, even if ye will not believe me,
still believe the works; and know that I am in the Father, and the
Father in me.” <span id="fr_8068"></span>[8069](#fn_8068.md) It must
therefore be by the works that the Father is in the Son, and the Son in
the Father; and so it is by the works that we understand that the Father
is one *with the Son*. All along did He therefore strenuously aim at
this conclusion, that while they were of one power and essence, they
should still be believed to be Two; for otherwise, unless they were
believed to be Two, the Son could not possibly be believed to have any
existence at all.
