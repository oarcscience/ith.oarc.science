<span id="v.x.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.x.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.</span>

<span id="v.x.iii-p2"></span>Nor should I think it needful to discuss
whether God pursues a worthy course in forbidding His own name and
honour to be given over to a lie, or does so in not consenting that such
as He has plucked from the maze of false religion should return again to
Egypt, or does so in not suffering to depart from Him them whom He has
chosen for Himself. Thus that, too, will not require to be treated by
us, whether He has wished to be kept the rule which He has chosen to
appoint, and whether He justly avenges the abandonment of the rule which
He has wished to be kept; since He would have appointed it to no purpose
if He had not wished it kept, and would have to no purpose wished it
kept if He had been unwilling to uphold it.  My next step, indeed, is to
put to the test these appointments of God in opposition to false
religions, the completely vanquished as well as also the punished, since
on these will depend the entire argument for martyrdoms. Moses was apart
with God on the mountain, when the people, not brooking his absence,
which was so needful, seek to make gods for themselves, which, for his
own part, he will prefer to destroy. <span
id="fr_8245"></span>[8246](#fn_8245) Aaron is importuned, and commands
that the earrings of their women be brought together, that they may be
thrown into the fire. For the people were about to lose, as a judgment
upon themselves, the true ornaments for the ears, the words of God. The
wise fire makes for them the molten likeness of a calf, reproaching them
with having the heart where they have their treasure also,—in Egypt, to
wit, which clothed with sacredness, among the other animals, a certain
ox likewise.  Therefore the slaughter of three thousand by their nearest
relatives, because they had displeased their so very near relative God,
solemnly marked both the commencement and the deserts of the trespass.
Israel having, as we are told in Numbers, <span
id="fr_8246"></span>[8247](#fn_8246) turned aside at Sethim, the people
go to the daughters of Moab to gratify their lust: they are allured to
the idols, so that they committed whoredom with the spirit also:
finally, they eat of their defiled *sacrifices*; then they both worship
the gods of the nation, and are admitted to the rites of Beelphegor. For
this lapse, too, into idolatry, sister to adultery, it took the
slaughter of twenty-three thousand by the swords of their countrymen to
appease the divine anger.  After the death of Joshua the son of Nave
they forsake the God of their fathers, and serve idols, Baalim and
Ashtaroth; <span id="fr_8247"></span>[8248](#fn_8247) and the Lord in
anger delivered them up to the hands of spoilers, and they continued to
be spoiled by them, and to be sold to their adversaries, and could not
at all stand before their enemies.  Whithersoever they went forth, His
hand was upon them for evil, and they were greatly distressed. And after
this God sets judges (*<span class="c42"><span
id="v.x.iii-p5.2"></span>critas</span>*), the same as our censors, over
them. But not even these did they continue steadfastly to obey. So soon
as one of the judges died, they proceeded to transgress more than their
fathers had done by going after the gods of others, and serving and
worshipping them. Therefore the Lord was angry. “Since, indeed,” He
says, “this nation have transgressed my covenant which I established
with their fathers, and have not hearkened to my voice, I also will give
no heed to remove from before them a man of the nations which Joshua
left at his death.” <span id="fr_8248"></span>[8249](#fn_8248) And thus,
throughout almost all the annals of the judges and of the kings who
succeeded them, while the strength of the surrounding nations was
preserved, He meted wrath out to Israel by war and captivity and a
foreign yoke, as often as they turned aside from Him, especially to
idolatry.
