<span id="v.iii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Heretics are Self-Condemned.
Heresy is Self-Will, Whilst Faith is Submission of Our Will to the
Divine Authority.  The Heresy of Apelles.</span>

<span id="v.iii.vi-p2"></span>On this point, however, we dwell no
longer, since it is the same Paul who, in his Epistle to the Galatians,
counts “heresies” among “the sins of the flesh,” <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896.md) who also intimates to Titus, that
“a man who is a heretic” must be “rejected after the first admonition,”
on the ground that “he that is such is perverted, and committeth sin, as
a self-condemned man.” <span id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897.md)
Indeed, in almost every epistle, when enjoining on us (the duty) of
avoiding false doctrines, he sharply condemns <span
id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898.md) heresies. Of these the practical
effects <span id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899.md) are false doctrines,
called in Greek *heresies*, <span id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900.md) a
word used in the sense of that *choice* which a man makes when he either
teaches them (to others) <span id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901.md) or
takes up with them (for himself). <span
id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902.md) For this reason it is that he calls
the heretic *self-condemned*, <span id="fr_1903"></span>[1904](#fn_1903.md)
because he has himself chosen that <span id="page_246">p. 246</span>
<span id="v.iii.vi-Page_246"></span>for which he is condemned. We,
however, are not permitted to cherish any object <span
id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904.md) after our own will, nor yet to make
choice of that which another has introduced of his private fancy. In the
Lord’s apostles we possess our authority; for even they did not of
themselves choose to introduce anything, but faithfully delivered to the
nations (of mankind) the doctrine <span
id="fr_1905"></span>[1906](#fn_1905.md) which they had received from
Christ. If, therefore, even “an angel from heaven should preach any
other gospel” (than theirs), he would be called accursed <span
id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906.md) by us. The Holy Ghost had even then
foreseen that there would be in a certain virgin (called)
Philumene <span id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907.md) an angel of deceit,
“transformed into an angel of light,” <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908.md) by whose miracles and
illusions <span id="fr_1909"></span>[1910](#fn_1909.md) Apelles was led
(when) he introduced his new heresy.
