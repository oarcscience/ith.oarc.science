<span id="v.v.i-p6"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.i-p6.1"></span>Chapter I.—The Opinions of Hermogenes, by the
Prescriptive Rule of Antiquity Shown to Be Heretical. Not Derived from
Christianity, But from Heathen Philosophy. Some of the Tenets
Mentioned.</span>

<span id="v.v.i-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.v.i-p7.1"></span>We</span> are accustomed, for the purpose of
shortening argument, <span id="fr_6128"></span>[6129](#fn_6128.md) to lay
down the rule against heretics of the *lateness* of their date. <span
id="fr_6129"></span>[6130](#fn_6129.md) For in *as* far as by our rule,
priority is given to the truth, which also foretold that there would be
heresies, in *so* far must all later opinions be prejudged as heresies,
being such as were, by the more ancient rule of truth, predicted as (one
day) to happen. Now, the doctrine of Hermogenes has this <span
id="fr_6130"></span>[6131](#fn_6130.md) taint of novelty. He is, in
short, <span id="fr_6131"></span>[6132](#fn_6131.md) a man *living* in the
world at the present time; by his very nature a heretic, and turbulent
withal, who mistakes loquacity for eloquence, and supposes impudence to
be firmness, and judges it to be the duty of a good conscience to speak
ill of individuals. <span id="fr_6132"></span>[6133](#fn_6132.md) Moreover,
he despises God’s law in his painting, <span
id="fr_6133"></span>[6134](#fn_6133.md) maintaining repeated
marriages, <span id="fr_6134"></span>[6135](#fn_6134.md) alleges the law of
God in defence of lust, <span id="fr_6135"></span>[6136](#fn_6135.md) *and
yet* despises it in respect of his art. <span
id="fr_6136"></span>[6137](#fn_6136.md) He falsifies by a twofold
process—with his cautery and his pen. <span
id="fr_6137"></span>[6138](#fn_6137.md) He is a thorough adulterer, both
doctrinally and carnally, since he is rank indeed with the contagion of
your marriage-hacks, <span id="fr_6138"></span>[6139](#fn_6138.md) and has
also failed in cleaving to the rule of faith as much as the apostle’s
own Hermogenes. <span id="fr_6139"></span>[6140](#fn_6139.md) However,
never mind the man, when it is his doctrine which I question. He does
not appear to acknowledge any other Christ as Lord, <span
id="fr_6140"></span>[6141](#fn_6140.md) though he holds Him in a different
way; but by this difference in his faith he really makes Him another
being,—nay, he takes from Him everything which is God, since he will not
have it that He made all things of nothing. For, turning away from
Christians to the philosophers, from the Church to the Academy and the
Porch, he learned there from the Stoics how to place Matter (on the same
level) with the Lord, just as if it too had existed ever both unborn and
unmade, having no beginning at all nor end, out of which, according to
him, <span id="fr_6141"></span>[6142](#fn_6141.md) the Lord afterwards
created all things.

<span id="fn_6128"></span>[477:6129](0030470.htm#fr_6128.md) <span
id="v.v.i-p7.3"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p8"></span> Compendii gratia. \[The reference here to
the *De Præscript.* forbids us to date this tract earlier than 207 <span
class="sc"><span id="v.v.i-p8.2"></span>a.d.</span> Of this Hermogenes,
we only know that he was probably a Carthaginian, a painter, and of a
versatile and clever mind.\]

<span id="fn_6129"></span>[477:6130](0030470.htm#fr_6129.md) <span
id="v.v.i-p8.3"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p9"></span> This is the criterion prescribed in the
*Præscript. Hæret.*xxxi. xxxiv., and often applied by Tertullian.  See
our *Anti-Marcion*, pp. 272, 345, 470, and *passim*.

<span id="fn_6130"></span>[477:6131](0030470.htm#fr_6130.md) <span
id="v.v.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p10"></span> The *tam* novella is a relative phrase,
referring to the fore-mentioned *rule*.

<span id="fn_6133"></span>[477:6134](0030470.htm#fr_6133.md) <span
id="v.v.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p13"></span> Probably by painting idols (Rigalt.; and so
Neander).

<span id="fn_6134"></span>[477:6135](0030470.htm#fr_6134.md) <span
id="v.v.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p14"></span> It is uncertain whether Tertullian means to
charge Hermogenes with defending *polygamy*, or only *second marriages*,
in the phrase *nubit assidue*. Probably the latter, which was offensive
to the rigorous Tertullian; and so Neander puts it.

<span id="fn_6135"></span>[477:6136](0030470.htm#fr_6135.md) <span
id="v.v.i-p14.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p15"></span> Quoting [Gen. i.
28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028.md)<span id="v.v.i-p15.1"></span>, “Be
fruitful and multiply” (Rigalt.).

<span id="fn_6136"></span>[477:6137](0030470.htm#fr_6136.md) <span
id="v.v.i-p15.2"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p16"></span> Disregarding the law when it forbids the
representation of idols.  (Rigalt.).

<span id="fn_6137"></span>[477:6138](0030470.htm#fr_6137.md) <span
id="v.v.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p17"></span> Et cauterio et stilo. The former instrument
was used by the encaustic painters for *burning in* the wax colours into
the ground of their pictures (Westropp’s *Handbook of Archæology*, p.
219).  Tertullian charges Hermogenes with using his encaustic art to the
injury of the scriptures, by practically violating their precepts in his
artistic works; and with using his pen (stilus) in corrupting the
doctrine thereof by his heresy.

<span id="fn_6138"></span>[477:6139](0030470.htm#fr_6138.md) <span
id="v.v.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p18"></span> By the *nubentium contagium*, Tertullian,
in his Montanist rigour, censures those who married more than once.

<span id="fn_6139"></span>[477:6140](0030470.htm#fr_6139.md) <span
id="v.v.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p19"></span> [2 Tim. i.

<span id="fn_6140"></span>[477:6141](0030470.htm#fr_6140.md) <span
id="v.v.i-p19.2"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p20"></span> Thus differing from Marcion.

<span id="fn_6141"></span>[477:6142](0030470.htm#fr_6141.md) <span
id="v.v.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p21"></span> The force of the subjunctive, ex qua
*fecerit*.
