<span id="iv.xi.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Tertullian Refutes,
Physiologically, the Notion that the Soul is Introduced After
Birth.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xxv-p2"></span>I shall now return to the cause of this
digression, in order that I may explain how all souls are derived from
one, when and where and in what manner they are produced. Now, touching
this subject, it matters not whether the question be started by the
philosopher, by the heretic, or by the crowd. Those who profess the
truth care nothing about their opponents, especially such of them as
begin by maintaining that the soul is not conceived in the womb, nor is
formed and produced at the time that the flesh is moulded, but is
impressed from without upon the infant before his complete vitality, but
after the process of parturition. They say, moreover, that the human
seed having been duly deposited *ex concubiter*in the womb, and having
been by natural impulse quickened, it becomes condensed into the mere
substance of the flesh, which is in due time born, warm from the furnace
of the womb, and then released from its heat. (This flesh) resembles the
case of hot iron, which is in that state plunged into cold water; for,
being smitten by the cold air (into which it is born), it at once
receives the power of animation, and utters vocal sound. This view is
entertained by the Stoics, along with Ænesidemus, and occasionally by
Plato himself, when he tells us that the soul, being quite a separate
formation, originating elsewhere and externally to the womb, is
inhaled <span id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669.md) when the new-born
infant first draws breath, and by and by exhaled <span
id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670.md) with the man’s latest breath. We
shall see whether this view of his is merely fictitious. Even the
medical profession has not lacked its Hicesius, to prove a traitor both
to nature and his own calling. These gentlemen, I suppose, were too
modest to come to terms with women on the mysteries of childbirth, so
well known to the latter. But how much more is there for them to blush
at, when in the end they have the women to refute them, instead of
commending them. Now, in such a question as this, no one can be so
useful a teacher, judge, or witness, as the sex itself which is so
intimately concerned. Give us your testimony, then, ye mothers, whether
yet pregnant, or after delivery (let barren women and men keep
silence),—the truth of your own nature is in question, the reality of
your own suffering is the point to be decided.  (Tell us, then,) whether
you feel in the embryo within you any vital force <span
id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671.md) other than your own, with which
your bowels tremble, your sides shake, your entire womb throbs, and the
burden which oppresses you constantly changes its position? Are these
movements a joy to you, and a positive removal of anxiety, as making you
confident that your infant both possesses vitality and enjoys it?  Or,
should his restlessness cease, your first fear would be for him; and he
would be aware of it within you, since he is disturbed at the novel
sound; and you would crave for injurious diet, <span
id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672.md) or would even loathe your food—all
on his account; and then you and he, (in the closeness of your
sympathy,) would share together your common ailments—so far that with
your contusions and bruises would he actually become marked,—whilst
within you, and even on the selfsame parts of the body, taking to
himself thus peremptorily <span id="fr_1673"></span>[1674](#fn_1673.md) the
injuries of his mother! Now, whenever a livid hue and redness are
incidents of the blood, the blood will not be without the vital
principle, <span id="fr_1674"></span>[1675](#fn_1674.md) or soul; or when
disease attacks the soul or vitality, (it becomes a proof of its real
existence, since) there is no disease where there is no soul or
principle of life. Again, inasmuch as sustenance by food, and the want
thereof, growth and decay, fear and motion, are conditions of the soul
or life, he who experiences them must be alive. <span id="page_206">p.
206</span> <span id="iv.xi.xxv-Page_206"></span>And, so, he at last
ceases to live, who ceases to experience them.  And thus by and by
infants are still-born; but how so, unless they had life? For how could
any die, who had not previously lived? But sometimes by a cruel
necessity, whilst yet in the womb, an infant is put to death, when lying
awry in the orifice of the womb he impedes parturition, and kills his
mother, if he is not to die himself.  Accordingly, among surgeons’ tools
there is a certain instrument, which is formed with a nicely-adjusted
flexible frame for opening the *uterus* first of all, and keeping it
open; it is further furnished with an annular blade, <span
id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675.md) by means of which the limbs within
the womb are dissected with anxious but unfaltering care; its last
appendage being a blunted or covered hook, wherewith the entire *fœtus*
is extracted <span id="fr_1676"></span>[1677](#fn_1676.md) by a violent
delivery. There is also (another instrument in the shape of) a copper
needle or spike, by which the actual death is managed in this furtive
robbery of life: they give it, from its infanticide function, the name
of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xi.xxv-p10.1"></span>ἐμβρυοσφάκτης</span> , the slayer of the
infant, which was of course alive. Such apparatus was possessed both by
Hippocrates, and Asclepiades, and Erasistratus, and Herophilus, that
dissector of even adults, and the milder Soranus himself, who all knew
well enough that a living being had been conceived, and pitied this most
luckless infant state, which had first to be put to death, to escape
being tortured alive. Of the necessity of such harsh treatment I have no
doubt even Hicesius was convinced, although he imported their soul into
infants after birth from the stroke of the frigid air, because the very
term for soul, forsooth, in Greek answered to such a
refrigeration! <span id="fr_1677"></span>[1678](#fn_1677.md) Well, then,
have the barbarian and Roman nations received souls by some other
process, (I wonder;) for they have called the soul by another name than
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.xi.xxv-p11.1"></span>ψυχή</span>? How
many nations are there who commence life <span
id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678.md) under the broiling sun of the
torrid zone, scorching their skin into its swarthy hue? Whence do they
get their souls, with no frosty air to help them?  I say not a word of
those well-warmed bed-rooms, and all that apparatus of heat which ladies
in childbirth so greatly need, when a breath of cold air might endanger
their life. But in the very bath almost a babe will slip into life, and
at once his cry is heard! If, however, a good frosty air is to the soul
so indispensable a treasure, then beyond the German and the Scythian
tribes, and the Alpine and the Argæan heights, nobody ought ever to be
born! But the fact really is, that population is greater within the
temperate regions of the East and the West, and men’s minds are sharper;
whilst there is not a Sarmatian whose wits are not dull and humdrum. The
minds of men, too, would grow keener by reason of the cold, if their
souls came into being amidst nipping frosts; for as the substance is, so
must be its active power. Now, after these preliminary statements, we
may also refer to the case of those who, having been cut out of their
mother’s womb, have breathed and retained life—your Bacchuses <span
id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679.md) and Scipios. <span
id="fr_1680"></span>[1681](#fn_1680.md) If, however, there be any one who,
like Plato, <span id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681.md) supposes that two
souls cannot, more than two bodies could, co-exist in the same
individual, I, on the contrary, could show him not merely the
co-existence of two souls in one person, as also of two bodies in the
same womb, but likewise the combination of many other things in natural
connection with the soul—for instance, of demoniacal possession; and
*that* not of one only, as in the case of Socrates’ own demon; but of
seven spirits as in the case of the Magdalene; <span
id="fr_1682"></span>[1683](#fn_1682.md) and of a legion in number, as in
the Gadarene. <span id="fr_1683"></span>[1684](#fn_1683.md) Now one soul is
naturally more susceptible of conjunction with another soul, by reason
of the identity of their substance, than an evil spirit is, owing to
their diverse natures. But when the same philosopher, in the sixth book
of *The Laws*, warns us to beware lest a vitiation of seed should infuse
a soil into both body and soul from an illicit or debased concubinage, I
hardly know whether he is more inconsistent with himself in respect of
one of his previous statements, or of that which he had just made. For
he here shows us that the soul proceeds from human seed (and warns us to
be on our guard about it), not, (as he had said before,) from the first
breath of the new-born child. Pray, whence comes it that from similarity
of soul we resemble our parents in disposition, according to the
testimony of Cleanthes, <span id="fr_1684"></span>[1685](#fn_1684.md) if we
are not produced from this seed of the soul? Why, too, used the old
astrologers to cast a man’s nativity from his first conception, if his
soul also draws not its origin from that moment? To this (nativity)
likewise belongs the inbreathing of the soul, whatever that is.
