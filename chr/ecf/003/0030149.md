<span id="iv.viii.i.ix"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX. <span
id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594.md) —The Christians are Not the Cause of
Public Calamities: There Were Such Troubles Before Christianity.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.ix-p3"></span>But why should I be astonished at your
vain imputations?  Under the same natural form, malice and folly have
always been associated in one body and growth, and have ever opposed us
under the one instigator of error. <span
id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595.md) Indeed, I feel no astonishment; and
therefore, as it is necessary for my subject, I will enumerate some
instances, that you may feel the astonishment by the enumeration of the
folly into which you fall, when you insist on our being the causes of
every public calamity or injury. If the Tiber has overflowed its banks,
if the Nile has remained in its bed, if the sky has been still, or the
earth been in commotion, if death <span
id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596.md) has made its devastations, or famine
its afflictions, your cry immediately is, “This is the fault <span
id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597.md) of the Christians!” As if they who
fear the true God could have to fear a light thing, or at least anything
else (than an earthquake or famine, or such visitations). <span
id="fr_598"></span>[599](#fn_598.md) I suppose it is as despisers of your
gods that we call down on us these strokes of theirs. As we have
remarked already, <span id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599.md) three hundred
years have not yet passed in our existence; but what vast scourges
before that time fell on all the world, on its various cities and
provinces! what terrible wars, both foreign and domestic! what
pestilences, famines, conflagrations, yawnings, and quakings of the
earth has history recorded! <span id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600.md)
Where were the Christians, then, when the Roman state furnished so many
chronicles of its disasters? Where were the Christians when the islands
Hiera, Anaphe, and Delos, and Rhodes, and Cea were desolated with
multitudes of men? or, again, when the land mentioned by Plato as larger
than Asia or Africa was sunk in the Atlantic Sea? or when fire from
heaven overwhelmed Volsinii, and flames from their own mountain consumed
Pompeii? when the sea of Corinth was engulphed by an earthquake? when
the whole world was destroyed by the deluge? Where *then* were (I will
not say the Christians, who despise your gods, but) your gods
themselves, who are proved to be of later origin than that great ruin by
the very places and cities in which they were born, sojourned, and were
buried, and even those which they founded?  For else they would not have
remained to the present day, unless they had been more recent than that
catastrophe.  If you do not care to peruse and reflect upon these
testimonies of history, the record of which affects you differently from
us, <span id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601.md) in order <span
id="page_118">p. 118</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.ix-Page_118"></span>especially that you may not have to
tax your gods with extreme injustice, since they injure even their
worshippers on account of their despisers, do you not then prove
yourselves to be also in the wrong, when you hold them to be gods, who
make no distinction between the deserts of yourselves and profane
persons? If, however, as it is now and then very vainly said, you incur
the chastisement of your gods because you are too slack in our
extirpation, you then have settled the question <span
id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602.md) of their weakness and insignificance;
for they would not be angry with you for loitering over our punishment,
if they could do anything themselves,—although you admit the same thing
indeed in another way, whenever by inflicting punishment on us you seem
to be avenging them.  If one interest is maintained by another party,
that which defends is the greater of the two. What a shame, then, must
it be for gods to be defended by a human being!
