<span id="iv.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Idolatry in Its More Limited
Sense. Its Copiousness.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p2"></span>But let the universal names of crimes
withdraw to the specialities of their own works; let idolatry remain in
that which it is itself. Sufficient to itself is a name so inimical to
God, a substance of crime so copious, which <span id="page_62">p.
62</span> <span id="iv.iv.ii-Page_62"></span>reaches forth so many
branches, diffuses so many veins, that from this *name*, for the
greatest part, is drawn the material of all the modes in which the
expansiveness of idolatry has to be foreguarded against by us, since in
manifold wise it subverts the servants of God; and this not only when
unperceived, but also when cloaked over.  Most men simply regard
idolatry as to be interpreted in these senses alone, viz.: if one burn
incense, or immolate *a victim*, or give a sacrificial banquet, or be
bound to some sacred functions or priesthoods; just as if one were to
regard adultery as to be accounted in kisses, and in embraces, and in
actual fleshly contact; or murder as to be reckoned only in the shedding
forth of blood, and in the actual taking away of life. But how far wider
an extent the Lord assigns to those crimes we are sure: when He defines
adultery *to consist* even in concupiscence, <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) “if one shall have cast an eye
lustfully on,” and stirred his soul with immodest commotion; when He
judges murder <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) *to consist* even
in a word of curse or of reproach, and in every impulse of anger, and in
the neglect of charity toward a brother just as John teaches, <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) that he who hates his brother is a
murderer.  Else, both the devil’s ingenuity in malice, and God the
Lord’s in the Discipline by which He fortifies us against the devil’s
depths, <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) would have but limited
scope, if we were judged only in such faults as even the heathen nations
have decreed punishable.  How will our “righteousness abound above that
of the Scribes and Pharisees,” as the Lord has prescribed, <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) unless we shall have seen through the
abundance of that adversary quality, that is, of *un*righteousness? But
if the head of unrighteousness is idolatry, the first point is, that we
be fore-fortified against the abundance of idolatry, while we recognise
it not only in its palpable manifestations.
