<span id="v.iii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Great Evil Ensues to the
Weak in Faith, from Any Discussion Out of the Scriptures. Conviction
Never Comes to the Heretic from Such a Process.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p2"></span>But with respect to the man for whose
sake you enter on the discussion of the Scriptures, <span
id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039) with the view of strengthening him
when afflicted with doubts, (let me ask) will it be to the truth, or
rather to heretical opinions that he will lean? Influenced by the very
fact that he sees you have made no progress, whilst the other side is on
an equal footing <span id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040) (with
yourself) in denying and in defence, or at any rate on a like
standing <span id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041) he will go away
confirmed in his uncertainty <span id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042)
by the discussion, not knowing which side to adjudge heretical. For, no
doubt, they too are able <span id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043) to
retort these things on us. It is indeed a necessary consequence that
they should go so far as to say that adulterations of the Scriptures,
and false expositions thereof, are rather introduced by ourselves,
inasmuch as they, no less than we <span
id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044) maintain that truth is on their
side.
