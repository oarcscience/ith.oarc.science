id="v.iv.iv.i-Page_321"></span><span class="c17"><span
id="v.iv.iv.i-p1.1"></span>Book III.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="v.iv.iv.i-p2.1"></span>Wherein Christ is shown to be the Son of God,
Who created the world; to have been predicted by the prophets; to have
taken human flesh like our own, by a real incarnation.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.i-p4"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.i-p4.1"></span>Chapter I.—Introductory; A Brief Statement of
the Preceding Argument in Connection with the Subject of This
Book.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.i-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.iv.iv.i-p5.1"></span>Following</span> the track of my original
treatise, the loss of which we are steadily proceeding <span
id="fr_3091"></span>[3092](#fn_3091.md) to restore, we come now, in the
order of our subject, to treat of Christ, although this be a work of
supererogation, <span id="fr_3092"></span>[3093](#fn_3092.md) after the
proof which we have gone through that there is but one only God. For no
doubt it has been already ruled with sufficient clearness, that Christ
must be regarded as pertaining to <span
id="fr_3093"></span>[3094](#fn_3093.md) no other God than the Creator, when
it has been determined that no other God but the Creator should be the
object of our faith. Him did Christ so expressly preach, whilst the
apostles one after the other also so clearly affirmed that Christ
belonged to <span id="fr_3094"></span>[3095](#fn_3094.md) no other God than
Him whom He Himself preached—that is, the Creator—that no mention of a
second God (nor, accordingly, of a second Christ) was ever agitated
previous to Marcion’s scandal.  This is most easily proved by an
examination <span id="fr_3095"></span>[3096](#fn_3095.md) of both the
apostolic and the heretical churches, <span
id="fr_3096"></span>[3097](#fn_3096.md) from which we are forced to declare
that *there* is undoubtedly a subversion of the rule (of faith), where
any opinion is found of later date, <span
id="fr_3097"></span>[3098](#fn_3097.md) —a point which I have inserted in
my first book. <span id="fr_3098"></span>[3099](#fn_3098.md) A discussion
of it would unquestionably be of value even now, when we are about to
make a separate examination into (the subject of) Christ; because,
whilst proving Christ to be the Creator’s *Son*, we are effectually
shutting out the God of Marcion. Truth should employ all her available
resources, and in no limping way. <span
id="fr_3099"></span>[3100](#fn_3099.md) In our compendious rules of faith,
however, she has it all her own way. <span
id="fr_3100"></span>[3101](#fn_3100.md) But I have resolved, like an
earnest man, <span id="fr_3101"></span>[3102](#fn_3101.md) to meet my
adversary every way and everywhere in the madness of his heresy, which
is so great, that he has found it easier to assume that that Christ has
come who was never heard of, than He who has always been predicted.

before laid down, touching ‘the later date’ (illo fine supra dicto
*posteritatis*), whereby they (i.e., certain novel opinions) would at
once be condemned on the ground of their age alone.”  In 31 of the same
work he contrasts “*posteritatem* mendacitatis” with “principalitatem
veritatis”—“the latter date of falsehood” with “the primary date of
truth.”  \[pp. 258, 260, *supra*.\]
