<span id="v.viii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Earthy Material of Which
Flesh is Created Wonderfully Improved by God’s Manipulation. By the
Addition of the Soul in Man’s Constitution It Became the Chief Work in
the Creation.</span>

<span id="v.viii.vii-p2"></span>But perhaps the dignity of the flesh may
seem to be diminished, because it has not been actually manipulated by
the hand of God, as the clay was *at first*. Now, when God handled the
clay for the express purpose of the growth of flesh out of it
afterwards, it was for the flesh that He took all the trouble. But I
want you, moreover, to know at what time and in what manner the flesh
flourished into beauty out of *its* clay. For it cannot be, as some will
have it, that those “coats of skins” <span
id="fr_7331"></span>[7332](#fn_7331.md) which Adam and Eve put on when they
were stripped of paradise, were really themselves the forming of the
flesh out of clay, <span id="fr_7332"></span>[7333](#fn_7332.md) because
long before that Adam had already recognised the flesh which was in the
woman as the propagation of his own substance (“This is now bone of my
bone, and flesh of my flesh” <span id="fr_7333"></span>[7334](#fn_7333.md)
), and the very taking of the woman out of the man was supplemented with
flesh; but it ought, I should suppose, to have been made good with clay,
if Adam was still clay. The clay, therefore, was obliterated and
absorbed into flesh.  When *did this happen*? At the time that man
became a living soul by the inbreathing of God—by the breath indeed
which was capable of hardening clay into another substance, as into some
earthenware, so now into flesh. In the same way the potter, too, has it
in his power, by tempering the blast of his fire, to modify his clayey
material into a stiffer one, and to mould one form after another more
beautiful than the original substance, and now possessing both a kind
and name of its own. For although the Scripture says, “Shall the clay
say to the potter?” <span id="fr_7334"></span>[7335](#fn_7334.md) that is,
Shall man *contend* with God? although the apostle speaks of “earthen
vessels” <span id="fr_7335"></span>[7336](#fn_7335.md) he refers to man,
who was originally clay.  And the vessel is the flesh, because *this was
made* of clay by the breath of the divine *afflatus*; and it was
afterwards clothed with “the coats of skins,” that is, with the
cutaneous covering which was placed over it. So truly is this the fact,
that if you withdraw the skin, you lay bare the flesh.  Thus, that which
becomes a spoil when stripped off, was a vestment as long as it remained
laid over. Hence the apostle, when he call circumcision “a putting off
(or spoliation) of the flesh,” <span
id="fr_7336"></span>[7337](#fn_7336.md) affirmed the skin to be a coat or
tunic.  Now this being the case, you have both the clay made glorious by
the hand of God, and the flesh more glorious still by His breathing upon
it, by virtue of which the flesh not only laid aside its clayey
rudiments, but also took on itself the ornaments of the soul.  You
surely are not more careful than God, that *you* indeed should refuse to
mount the gems of Scythia and India and the pearls of the Red Sea in
lead, or brass, or iron, or even in silver, but should set them in the
most precious and most highly-wrought gold; or, again, that you should
provide for your finest wines and most costly unguents the most fitting
vessels; or, on the same principle, should find for your swords of
finished temper scabbards of equal worth; whilst *God* must consign to
some vilest sheath the shadow of His own soul, the breath of His own
Spirit, the operation of His own mouth, and by so ignominious a
consignment secure, of course, its condemnation. Well, then, has He
placed, or rather inserted and commingled, it with the flesh? Yes; and
so intimate is the union, that it may be deemed to be uncertain whether
the flesh bears about the soul, or the soul the flesh; or whether the
flesh acts as *apparitor* to the soul, or the soul to the flesh. It is,
however, more credible that the soul has service rendered to <span
id="page_551">p. 551</span> <span
id="v.viii.vii-Page_551"></span>it, <span
id="fr_7337"></span>[7338](#fn_7337.md) and has the mastery, <span
id="fr_7338"></span>[7339](#fn_7338.md) as being more proximate in
character to God. <span id="fr_7339"></span>[7340](#fn_7339.md) This
circumstance even redounds to the glory of the flesh, inasmuch as it
both contains an essence nearest to God’s, and renders itself a partaker
of (the soul’s) actual sovereignty. For what enjoyment of nature is
there, what produce of the world, what relish of the elements, which is
not imparted to the soul by means of the body? How can it be otherwise?
Is it not by its means that *the soul* is supported by the entire
apparatus of the senses—the sight, the hearing, the taste, the smell,
the touch? Is it not by its means that it has a sprinkling of the divine
power, there being nothing which it does not effect by its faculty of
speech, even when it is only tacitly indicated? And speech is the result
of a fleshly organ. The arts come through the flesh; through the flesh
also effect is given to the mind’s pursuits and powers; all work, too,
and business and offices of life, are accomplished by the flesh; and so
utterly are the living acts of the soul the work of the flesh, that for
the soul to cease to do living acts, would be nothing else than
sundering itself from the flesh. So also the very act of dying is a
function of the flesh, even as the process of life is. Now, if all
things are subject to the soul through the flesh, their subjection is
equally due to the flesh. That which is the means and agent of your
enjoyment, must needs be also the partaker and sharer of your enjoyment.
So that the flesh, which is accounted the minister and servant of the
soul, turns out to be also its associate and co-heir. And if all this in
temporal things, why not also in things eternal?
