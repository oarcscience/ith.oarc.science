<span id="iv.vii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.vii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.</span>

<span id="iv.vii.v-p2"></span>Your cruelty is our glory. Only see you to
it, that in having such things as these to endure, we do not feel
ourselves constrained to rush forth to the combat, if only to prove that
we have no dread of them, but on the contrary, even invite their
infliction.  When Arrius Antoninus was driving things hard in Asia, the
whole Christians of the province, in one united band, presented
themselves before his judgment-seat; on which, ordering a few to be led
forth to execution, he said to the rest, “O miserable men, if you wish
to die, you have precipices or halters.” If we should take it into our
heads to do the same thing here, what will you make of so many
thousands, of such a multitude of men and women, persons of every sex
and every age and every rank, when they present themselves before you? 
How many fires, how many swords will be required? What will be the
anguish of Carthage itself, which you will have to decimate, <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) as each one recognises there his
rela<span id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span
id="iv.vii.v-Page_108"></span>tives and companions, as he sees there it
may be men of your own order, and noble ladies, and all the leading
persons of the city, and either kinsmen or friends of those of your own
circle? Spare thyself, if not us poor Christians! Spare Carthage, if not
thyself! Spare the province, which the indication of your purpose has
subjected to the threats and extortions at once of the soldiers and of
private enemies.

<span id="iv.vii.v-p4"></span>*We* have no master but God. *He is
before* you, and cannot be hidden from you, but to Him you can do no
injury. But those whom you regard as masters are only men, and one day
they themselves must die. Yet still this community will be undying, for
be assured that just in the time of its seeming overthrow it is built up
into greater power. For all who witness the noble patience of its
martyrs, as struck with misgivings, are inflamed with desire to examine
into the matter in question; <span id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) and
as soon as they come to know the truth, they straightway enrol
themselves its disciples.

neglecting to include such considerations, in accounting for the growth
of the church, is justly censured by Kaye, p. 124.\]
