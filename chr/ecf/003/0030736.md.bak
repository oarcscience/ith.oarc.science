<span id="vi.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Of Paul’s Assertion, that He
Had Not Been Sent to Baptize.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xiv-p2"></span>But they roll back *an objection* from
*that* apostle himself, in that he said, “For Christ sent me not to
baptize;” <span id="fr_8684"></span>[8685](#fn_8684.md) as if by this
argument baptism were done away!  For *if so*, why did he baptize Gaius,
and Crispus, and the house of Stephanas? <span
id="fr_8685"></span>[8686](#fn_8685.md) However, even if Christ had not
sent *him* to baptize, yet He had given *other* apostles the precept to
baptize. But these words were written to the Corinthians in regard of
the circumstances of that particular time; seeing that schisms and
dissensions were agitated among them, while one attributes *everything*
to Paul, another to Apollos. <span id="fr_8686"></span>[8687](#fn_8686.md)
For which reason the “peace-making” <span
id="fr_8687"></span>[8688](#fn_8687.md) apostle, for fear he should seem to
claim all *gifts* for himself, says that he had been sent “not to
baptize, but to preach.” For preaching is the prior thing, baptizing the
posterior.  Therefore the preaching came *first*: but I think baptizing
withal was *lawful* to him to whom preaching was.
