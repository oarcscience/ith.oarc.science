id="iv.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Grief of the Faithful at the
Admission of Idol-Makers into the Church; Nay, Even into the
Ministry.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii-p2"></span>A whole day the zeal of faith will direct
its pleadings to this quarter: bewailing that a Christian should come
from idols into the Church; should come from an adversary workshop into
the house of God; should raise to God the Father hands which are the
mothers of idols; should pray to God with the hands which, out of doors,
are prayed to in opposition to God; should apply to the Lord’s body
those hands which confer bodies on demons. Nor is this sufficient. Grant
that it be a small matter, if from other hands they receive what they
contaminate; but even those very hands deliver to others what they have
contaminated. Idol-artificers are chosen even into the ecclesiastical
order. Oh wickedness! Once did the Jews lay brands on Christ; these
mangle His body daily.  Oh hands to be cut off! Now let the saying, “If
thy hand make thee do evil, amputate it,” <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) see to it whether it were uttered by
way of similitude *merely*. What hands more to be amputated than those
in which scandal is done to the Lord’s body?
