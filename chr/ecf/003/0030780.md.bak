id="vi.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.</span>

<span id="vi.v.vi-p2"></span>Passing, too, from examples of enduring
constancy having such an origin as this, let us turn to a simple
contemplation of man’s estate in its ordinary conditions, that mayhap
from things which happen to us whether we will or no, and which we must
set our minds to bear, we may get instruction.  How often, then, have
fires consumed the living! How often have wild beasts torn men in
pieces, it may be in their own forests, or it may be in the heart of
cities, when they have chanced to escape from their dens! How many have
fallen by the robber’s sword! How many have suffered at the hands of
enemies the death of the cross, after having been tortured first, yes,
<span id="page_696">p. 696</span> <span id="vi.v.vi-Page_696"></span>and
treated with every sort of contumely! One may even suffer in the cause
of a man what he hesitates to suffer in the cause of God. In reference
to this indeed, let the present time <span
id="fr_8968"></span>[8969](#fn_8968.md) bear testimony, when so many
persons of rank have met with death in a mere human being’s cause, and
that though from their birth and dignities and bodily condition and age
such a fate seemed most unlikely; either suffering at his hands if they
have taken part against him, or from his enemies if they have been his
partisans.
