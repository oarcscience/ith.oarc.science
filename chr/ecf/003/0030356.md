<span id="v.iv.iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The Attributes of Goodness
and Justice Should Not Be Separated. They are Compatible in the True
God. The Function of Justice in the Divine Being Described.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xii-p2"></span>Since, therefore, there is this union
and agreement between goodness and justice, you cannot prescribe <span
id="fr_2852"></span>[2853](#fn_2852.md) their separation. With what face
will you determine the separation of your two Gods, regarding in their
separate condition one as distinctively the good God, and the other as
distinctively the just God? Where the just is, there also exists the
good. In short, from the very first the Creator was both good and also
just.  And both His attributes advanced together. His goodness created,
His justice arranged, the world; and in this process it even then
decreed that the world should be formed of good materials, because it
took counsel with goodness. The work of justice is apparent, in the
separation which was pronounced between light and darkness, between day
and night, between heaven and earth, between the water above and the
water beneath, between the gathering together of the sea and the mass of
the dry land, between the greater lights and the lesser, between the
luminaries of the day and those of the night, between male and female,
between the tree of knowledge of death and of life, between the world
and paradise, between the aqueous and the earth-born animals. As
goodness conceived all things, so did justice discriminate them. With
the determination of the latter, everything was arranged and set in
order. Every site and quality <span id="fr_2853"></span>[2854](#fn_2853.md)
of the elements, their effect, motion, and state, the rise and setting
of each, are the judicial determinations of the Creator.  Do not suppose
that His function as a judge must be defined as beginning when evil
began, and so tarnish His justice with the cause of evil. By such
considerations, then, do we show that this attribute advanced in company
with goodness, the author <span id="fr_2854"></span>[2855](#fn_2854.md) of
all things,—worthy of being herself, too, deemed innate and natural, and
not as accidentally accruing <span id="fr_2855"></span>[2856](#fn_2855.md)
to God, inasmuch as she was found to be in Him, her Lord, the arbiter of
His works.
