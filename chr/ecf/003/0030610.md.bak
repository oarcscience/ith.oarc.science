<span id="v.viii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Prophetic Things and
Actions, as Well as Words, Attest This Great Doctrine.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxviii-p2"></span>But we know that prophecy expressed
itself by things no less than by words. By words, and also by deeds, is
the resurrection foretold. When Moses puts his hand into his bosom, and
then draws it out again dead, and again puts his hand into his bosom,
and plucks it out living, <span id="fr_7480"></span>[7481](#fn_7480.md)
does not this apply as a presage to all mankind?—inasmuch as those three
signs <span id="fr_7481"></span>[7482](#fn_7481.md) denoted the threefold
power of God: when it shall, first, in the appointed order, subdue to
man the old serpent, the devil, <span
id="fr_7482"></span>[7483](#fn_7482.md) however formidable; then, secondly,
draw forth the flesh from the bosom of death; <span
id="fr_7483"></span>[7484](#fn_7483.md) and then, at last, shall pursue all
blood (shed) in judgment. <span id="fr_7484"></span>[7485](#fn_7484.md) On
this subject we read in the writings of the same prophet, (how that) God
says:  “For your blood of your lives will I require of all wild beasts;
and I will require it of the hand of man, and of his brother’s
hand.” <span id="fr_7485"></span>[7486](#fn_7485.md) Now nothing is
required except that which is demanded back again, and nothing is thus
demanded except that which is to be given up; and that will of course be
given up, which shall be demanded and required on the ground of
vengeance. But indeed there cannot possibly be punishment of that which
never had any existence. Existence, however, it will have, when it is
restored in order to be punished. To the flesh, therefore, applies
everything which is declared respecting the blood, for without the flesh
there cannot be blood. The flesh will be raised up in order that the
blood may be punished.  There are, again, some statements (of Scripture)
so plainly made as to be free from all obscurity of allegory, and yet
they strongly require <span id="fr_7486"></span>[7487](#fn_7486.md) their
very simplicity to be interpreted.  There is, for instance, that passage
in Isaiah: “I will kill, and I will make alive.” <span
id="fr_7487"></span>[7488](#fn_7487.md) Certainly His making alive is to
take place after He has killed. As, therefore, it is by death that He
kills, it is by the resurrection that He will make alive. Now it is the
flesh which is killed by death; the flesh, therefore, will be revived by
the resurrection. Surely if killing means taking away life from the
flesh, and its opposite, reviving, amounts to restoring life to the
flesh, it must needs be that the flesh rise again, to which the life,
which has been taken away by killing, has to be restored by
vivification.
