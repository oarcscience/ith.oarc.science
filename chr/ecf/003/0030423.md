<span id="v.iv.v.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—On the Mission of the Seventy
Disciples, and Christ’s Charge to Them.  Precedents Drawn from the Old
Testament.  Absurdity of Supposing that Marcion’s Christ Could Have
Given the Power of Treading on Serpents and Scorpions.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxiv-p2"></span>He chose also seventy other
missionaries <span id="fr_4414"></span>[4415](#fn_4414) besides the
twelve. Now why, if the twelve followed the number of the twelve
fountains of Elim, <span id="fr_4415"></span>[4416](#fn_4415) should not
the seventy correspond to the like number of the palms of that
place? <span id="fr_4416"></span>[4417](#fn_4416) Whatever be the
*Antitheses* of the comparison, it is a diversity in the causes, not in
the powers, which has mainly produced them.  But if one does not keep in
view the diversity of the *causes*, <span
id="fr_4417"></span>[4418](#fn_4417) he is very apt to infer a
difference of *powers*. <span id="fr_4418"></span>[4419](#fn_4418) When
the children of Israel went out of Egypt, the Creator brought them forth
laden with their spoils of gold and silver vessels, and with loads
besides of raiment and unleavened dough; <span
id="fr_4419"></span>[4420](#fn_4419) whereas Christ commanded His
disciples not to carry even a staff <span
id="fr_4420"></span>[4421](#fn_4420) for their journey. The former were
thrust forth into a desert, but the latter were sent into cities.
Consider the difference presented in the occasions, <span
id="fr_4421"></span>[4422](#fn_4421) and you will understand how it was
one and the same power which arranged the mission <span
id="fr_4422"></span>[4423](#fn_4422) of His people according to their
poverty in the one case, and their plenty in the other. He cut
down <span id="fr_4423"></span>[4424](#fn_4423) their supplies when they
could be replenished through the cities, just as He had
accumulated <span id="fr_4424"></span>[4425](#fn_4424) them when exposed
to the scantiness of the desert. Even shoes He forbade them to carry.
For it was He under whose very protection the people wore not out a
shoe, <span id="fr_4425"></span>[4426](#fn_4425) even in the wilderness
for the space of so many years. “No one,” says He, “shall ye salute by
the way.” <span id="fr_4426"></span>[4427](#fn_4426) What a destroyer of
the prophets, forsooth, is Christ, seeing it is from them that He
received his precept also! When Elisha sent on his servant Gehazi before
him to raise the Shunammite’s son from death, I rather think he gave him
these instructions: <span id="fr_4427"></span>[4428](#fn_4427) “Gird up
thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet
any man, salute him not; <span id="fr_4428"></span>[4429](#fn_4428) and
if any salute thee, answer him not again.” <span
id="fr_4429"></span>[4430](#fn_4429) For what is a wayside blessing but
a mutual salutation as men meet? So also the Lord commands: “Into
whatsoever house they enter, let them say, Peace be to it.” <span
id="fr_4430"></span>[4431](#fn_4430) Herein He follows the very same
example. For Elisha enjoined upon his servant the same salutation when
he met the Shunammite; he was to say to her: “Peace to thine husband,
peace to thy child.” <span id="fr_4431"></span>[4432](#fn_4431) Such
will be rather our *Antitheses*; they compare Christ with, instead of
sundering Him from, the Creator. “The labourer is worthy of his
hire.” <span id="fr_4432"></span>[4433](#fn_4432) Who could better
pronounce such a sentence than the Judge? For to decide that the workman
deserves his wages, is in itself a judicial act. There is no award which
consists not in a process of judgment. The law of the Creator on this
point also presents us with a corroboration, for He judges that
labouring oxen are as labourers worthy of their hire: “Thou shalt not
muzzle,” says He, “the ox when he treadeth out the corn.” <span
id="fr_4433"></span>[4434](#fn_4433) Now, who is so good to man <span
id="fr_4434"></span>[4435](#fn_4434) as He who is also merciful to
cattle?  Now, when Christ pronounced labourers to be worthy of their
hire, He, in fact, exonerated from blame that precept of the Creator
about depriving the Egyptians of their gold and silver vessels. <span
id="fr_4435"></span>[4436](#fn_4435) For they who had built for the
Egyptians their houses and cities, were surely workmen worthy of their
hire, and were not instructed in a fraudulent act, but only set to claim
compensation for their hire, which they were unable in any other way to
exact from their masters. <span id="fr_4436"></span>[4437](#fn_4436)
That the kingdom of God was neither new nor unheard of, He in this way
affirmed, whilst at the same time He bids them announce that it was near
at hand. <span id="fr_4437"></span>[4438](#fn_4437) Now it is that which
<span id="page_388">p. 388</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxiv-Page_388"></span>was once far off, which can be properly
said to have become near.  If, however, a thing had never existed
previous to its becoming near, it could never have been said to have
approached, because it had never existed at a distance. Everything which
is new and unknown is also sudden. <span
id="fr_4438"></span>[4439](#fn_4438) Everything which is sudden, then,
first receives the accident of time <span
id="fr_4439"></span>[4440](#fn_4439) when it is announced, for it then
first puts on appearance of form. <span
id="fr_4440"></span>[4441](#fn_4440) Besides it will be impossible for a
thing either to have been tardy <span
id="fr_4441"></span>[4442](#fn_4441) all the while it remained
unannounced, <span id="fr_4442"></span>[4443](#fn_4442) or to have
approached <span id="fr_4443"></span>[4444](#fn_4443) from the time it
shall begin to be announced.

<span id="v.iv.v.xxiv-p33"></span>He likewise adds, that they should say
to such as would not receive them: “Notwithstanding be ye sure of this,
that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.” <span
id="fr_4444"></span>[4445](#fn_4444) If He does not enjoin this by way
of a commination, the injunction is a most useless one.  For what
mattered it to them that the kingdom was at hand, unless its approach
was accompanied with judgment?—even for the salvation of such as
received the announcement thereof. How, if there can be a threat without
its accomplishment, can you have in a threatening god, one that executes
also, and in both, one that is a judicial being? <span
id="fr_4445"></span>[4446](#fn_4445) So, again, He commands that the
dust be shaken off against them, as a testimony,—the very particles of
their ground which might cleave <span
id="fr_4446"></span>[4447](#fn_4446) to the sandal, not to mention <span
id="fr_4447"></span>[4448](#fn_4447) any other sort of communication
with them. <span id="fr_4448"></span>[4449](#fn_4448) But if their
churlishness <span id="fr_4449"></span>[4450](#fn_4449) and
inhospitality were to receive no vengeance from Him, for what purpose
does He premise a testimony, which surely forbodes some threats?
Furthermore, when the Creator also, in the book of Deuteronomy, forbids
the reception of the Ammonites and the Moabites into the church, <span
id="fr_4450"></span>[4451](#fn_4450) because, when His people came from
Egypt, they fraudulently withheld provisions from them with inhumanity
and inhospitality, <span id="fr_4451"></span>[4452](#fn_4451) it will be
manifest that the prohibition of intercourse descended to Christ from
Him. The form of it which He uses—“He that despiseth you, despiseth
me” <span id="fr_4452"></span>[4453](#fn_4452) —the Creator had also
addressed to Moses:  “Not against thee have they murmured, but against
me.” <span id="fr_4453"></span>[4454](#fn_4453) Moses, indeed, was as
much an apostle as the apostles were prophets. The authority of both
offices will have to be equally divided, as it proceeds from one and the
same Lord, (the God) of apostles and prophets.  Who is He that shall
bestow “the power of treading on serpents and scorpions?” <span
id="fr_4454"></span>[4455](#fn_4454) Shall it be He who is the Lord of
all living creatures or he who is not god over a single lizard? Happily
the Creator has promised by Isaiah to give this power even to little
children, of putting their hand in the cockatrice den and on the hole of
the young asps without at all receiving hurt. <span
id="fr_4455"></span>[4456](#fn_4455) And, indeed, we are aware (without
doing violence to the literal sense of the passage, since even these
noxious animals have actually been unable to do hurt where there has
been faith) that under the figure of scorpions and serpents are
portended evil spirits, whose very prince is described <span
id="fr_4456"></span>[4457](#fn_4456) by the name of serpent, dragon, and
every other most conspicuous beast in the power of the Creator. <span
id="fr_4457"></span>[4458](#fn_4457) This power the Creator conferred
first of all upon His Christ, even as the ninetieth Psalm says to Him:
“Upon the asp and the basilisk shalt Thou tread; the lion and the dragon
shalt Thou trample under foot.” <span
id="fr_4458"></span>[4459](#fn_4458) So also Isaiah: “In that day the
Lord God shall draw His sacred, great, and strong sword” (even His
Christ) “against that dragon, that great and tortuous serpent; and He
shall slay him in that day.” <span id="fr_4459"></span>[4460](#fn_4459)
But when the same prophet says, “The way shall be called a clean and
holy way; over it the unclean thing shall not pass, nor shall be there
any unclean way; but the dispersed shall pass over it, and they shall
not err therein; no lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go
up thereon; it shall not be found there,” <span
id="fr_4460"></span>[4461](#fn_4460) he points out the way of faith, by
which we shall reach to God; and then to this way of faith he promises
this utter crippling <span id="fr_4461"></span>[4462](#fn_4461) and
subjugation of all noxious animals.  Lastly, you may discover the
suitable times of the promise, if you read what precedes the passage:
“Be strong, ye weak hands and ye feeble knees: then the eyes of the
blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear; then shall
the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be
articulate.” <span id="fr_4462"></span>[4463](#fn_4462) When, therefore,
He proclaimed the benefits of His cures, then also did He put the
scorpions and the <span id="page_389">p. 389</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxiv-Page_389"></span>serpents under the feet of His
saints—even He who had first received this power from the Father, in
order to bestow it upon others and then manifested it forth conformably
to the order of prophecy. <span id="fr_4463"></span>[4464](#fn_4463)
