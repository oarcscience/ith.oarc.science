<span id="iv.xi.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIII.—The Entire Soul Being
Indivisible Remains to the Last Act of Vitality; Never Partially or
Fractionally Withdrawn from the Body.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.liii-p2"></span>But where at last will the soul have to
lodge, when it is bare and divested of the body? We must certainly not
hesitate to follow it thither, in the order of our inquiry. We must,
however, first of all fully state what belongs to the topic before us,
in order that no one, because we have mentioned the various issues of
death, may expect from us a special description of these, which ought
rather to be left to medical men, who are the proper judges of the
incidents which appertain to death, or its causes, and the actual
conditions of the human body. Of course, with the view of preserving the
truth of the soul’s immortality, whilst treating this topic, I shall
have, on mentioning death, to introduce phrases about dissolution of
such a purport as seems to intimate that the soul escapes by degrees,
and piece by piece; for it withdraws (from the body) with all the
circumstances of a decline, seeming to suffer consumption, and suggests
to us the idea of being annihilated by the slow process of its
departure. But the entire reason of this phenomenon is in the body, and
arises from the body. For whatever be the kind of death (which operates
on man), it undoubtedly produces the destruction either of the matter,
or of the region, or of the passages of vitality: of the matter, such as
the gall and the blood; of the region, such as the heart and the liver;
of the passages, such as the veins and the ar<span id="page_230">p.
230</span> <span id="iv.xi.liii-Page_230"></span>teries.  Inasmuch,
then, as these parts of the body are severally devastated by an injury
proper to each of them, even to the very last ruin and annulling of the
vital powers—in other words, of the ends, the sites, and the functions
of nature—it must needs come to pass, amidst the gradual decay of its
instruments, domiciles, and spaces, that the soul also itself, being
driven to abandon each successive part, assumes the appearance of being
lessened to nothing; in some such manner as a charioteer is assumed to
have himself failed, when his horses, through fatigue, withdraw from him
their energies. But this assumption applies only to the circumstances of
the despoiled person, not to any real condition of suffering. Likewise
the body’s charioteer, the animal spirit, fails on account of the
failure of its vehicle, not of itself—abandoning its work, but not its
vigour—languishing in operation, but not in essential condition—bankrupt
in solvency, not in substance—because ceasing to put in an appearance,
but not ceasing to exist. Thus every rapid death—such as a decapitation,
or a breaking of the neck, <span id="fr_1793"></span>[1794](#fn_1793.md)
which opens at once a vast outlet for the soul; or a sudden ruin, which
at a stroke crushes every vital action, like that inner ruin
apoplexy—retards not the soul’s escape, nor painfully separates its
departure into successive moments. Where, however, the death is a
lingering one, the soul abandons its position in the way in which it is
itself abandoned. And yet it is not by this process severed in
fractions: it is slowly drawn out; and whilst thus extracted, it causes
the last remnant to seem to be but a part of itself. No portion,
however, must be deemed separable, because it is the last; nor, because
it is a small one, must it be regarded as susceptible of dissolution.
Accordant with a series is its end, and the middle is prolonged to the
extremes; and the remnants cohere to the mass, and are waited for, but
never abandoned by it.  And I will even venture to say, that the last of
a whole is the whole; because while it is less, and the latest, it yet
belongs to the whole, and completes it. Hence, indeed, many times it
happens that the soul in its actual separation is more powerfully
agitated with a more anxious gaze, and a quickened loquacity; whilst
from the loftier and freer position in which it is now placed, it
enunciates, by means of its last remnant still lingering in the flesh,
what it sees, what it hears, and what it is beginning to know. In
Platonic phrase, indeed, the body is a prison, <span
id="fr_1794"></span>[1795](#fn_1794.md) but in the apostle’s it is “the
temple of God,” <span id="fr_1795"></span>[1796](#fn_1795.md) because it is
in Christ. Still, (as must be admitted,) by reason of its enclosure it
obstructs and obscures the soul, and sullies it by the concretion of the
flesh; whence it happens that the light which illumines objects comes in
upon the soul in a more confused manner, as if through a window of horn.
Undoubtedly, when the soul, by the power of death, is released from its
concretion with the flesh, it is by the very release cleansed and
purified: it is, moreover, certain that it escapes from the veil of the
flesh into open space, to its clear, and pure, and intrinsic light; and
then finds itself enjoying its enfranchisement from matter, and by
virtue of its liberty it recovers its divinity, as one who awakes out of
sleep passes from images to verities. Then it tells out what it sees;
then it exults or it fears, according as it finds what lodging is
prepared for it, as soon as it sees the very angel’s face, that
arraigner of souls, the Mercury of the poets.
