<span id="v.ix.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The Natural Invisibility of the
Father, and the Visibility of the Son Witnessed in Many Passages of the
Old Testament. Arguments of Their Distinctness, Thus Supplied.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xiv-p2"></span>Moreover, there comes to our aid, when we
insist upon the Father and the Son as being *Two*, that regulating
principle which has determined God to be invisible. When Moses in Egypt
desired to see the face of the Lord, saying, “If therefore I have found
grace in Thy sight, manifest Thyself unto me, that I may see Thee and
know Thee,” <span id="fr_7919"></span>[7920](#fn_7919.md) *God* said, “Thou
canst not see my face; for there shall no man see me, and live:” <span
id="fr_7920"></span>[7921](#fn_7920.md) in other words, he who sees me
shall die. Now we find that God has been seen by many persons, and yet
that no one who saw Him died (at the sight). *The truth is*, they saw
God according to the faculties of men, but not in accordance with the
full glory of the Godhead.  For the patriarchs are said to have seen God
(as Abraham and Jacob), and the prophets (as, for instance Isaiah and
Ezekiel), and yet they did not die. Either, then, they ought to have
died, since they had seen Him—for (the sentence runs), “No man shall see
God, and live;” or else if they saw God, and yet did not die, the
Scripture is false in stating that God said, “If a man see my face, he
shall not live.” Either way, the Scripture misleads us, when it makes
God invisible, and when it produces Him to our sight. Now, then, He must
be a different Being who was seen, because of one who was seen it could
not be predicated that He is invisible. It will therefore follow, that
by Him who is invisible we must understand the Father in the fulness of
His majesty, while we recognise the Son as visible by reason of the
dispensation of His derived existence; <span
id="fr_7921"></span>[7922](#fn_7921.md) even as it is not permitted us to
contemplate the sun, in the full amount of his substance which is in the
heavens, but we can only endure with our eyes a ray, by reason of the
tempered condition of this portion which is projected from him to the
earth. Here some one on the other side may be disposed to contend that
the Son is also invisible as being the Word, *and* as being also the
Spirit; <span id="fr_7922"></span>[7923](#fn_7922.md) and, while claiming
one nature for the Father and the Son, to affirm that the Father is
rather One and the Same *Person* with the Son. But the Scripture, as we
have said, maintains their difference by the distinction it makes
between the Visible and the Invisible. They then go on to argue to this
effect, that if it was the Son who then spake to Moses, He must mean it
of Himself that His face was visible to no one, because He was Himself
indeed the invisible Father in the name of the Son. And by this means
they will have it that the Visible and the Invisible are one and the
same, just as the Father and the Son are the same; (and this they
maintain) because in a preceding passage, before He had refused (the
sight of) His face to Moses, the Scripture informs us that “the Lord
spake face to face with Moses, even as a man speaketh unto his
friend;” <span id="fr_7923"></span>[7924](#fn_7923.md) just as Jacob also
says, “I have seen God face to face.” <span
id="fr_7924"></span>[7925](#fn_7924.md) Therefore the Visible and the
Invisible are one and the same; and both being thus the same, it follows
that He is invisible as the Father, and visible as the Son.  As if the
Scripture, according to our exposition of it, were inapplicable to the
Son, when the Father is set aside in His own invisibility. We declare,
however, that the Son also, considered in Himself (as the Son), is
invisible, in that He is God, and the Word and Spirit of God; but that
He was visible before *the days of* His flesh, in the way that He says
to Aaron and Miriam, “And if there shall be a prophet amongst you, I
will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a
dream; not as with Moses, with whom I shall speak mouth to mouth, even
*apparently*, that is to say, in truth, and not *enigmatically,*” that
is to say, in image; <span id="fr_7925"></span>[7926](#fn_7925.md) as the
apostle also expresses it, “Now we see through a glass, darkly (or
enigmatically), but then face to face.” <span
id="fr_7926"></span>[7927](#fn_7926.md) Since, therefore, He reserves to
some future time His presence and speech face to face with Moses—a
promise which was afterwards fulfilled in the retirement of the mount
(of transfiguration), when as we read in the Gospel, “Moses appeared
talking with Jesus” <span id="fr_7927"></span>[7928](#fn_7927.md) —it is
evident that in early times it was always in a glass, (as it were,) and
an enigma, in vision and dream, that God, I mean the Son of God,
appeared—to the prophets and the patriarchs, as also to Moses indeed
himself. And even if the Lord did possibly <span
id="fr_7928"></span>[7929](#fn_7928.md) speak with him face to face, yet it
was not as man that he could behold His face, unless indeed it was in a
glass, (as it were,) and by enigma. Besides, if the Lord so spake with
Moses, that Moses actually discerned His face, eye to eye, <span
id="fr_7929"></span>[7930](#fn_7929.md) how <span id="page_610">p.
610</span> <span id="v.ix.xiv-Page_610"></span>comes it to pass that
immediately afterwards, on the same occasion, he desires to see His
face, <span id="fr_7930"></span>[7931](#fn_7930.md) which he ought not to
have desired, because he had already seen it? And how, in like manner,
does the Lord also say that His face cannot be seen, because He had
shown it, if indeed He really had, (as our opponents suppose). Or what
is that face of God, the sight of which is refused, if there was one
which was visible to man? “I have seen God,” says Jacob, “face to face,
and my life is preserved.” <span id="fr_7931"></span>[7932](#fn_7931.md)
There ought to be some other face which kills if it be only seen. Well,
then, was the Son visible? (Certainly not, <span
id="fr_7932"></span>[7933](#fn_7932) .md) although He was the face of God,
except only in vision and dream, and in a glass and enigma, because the
Word and Spirit (of God) cannot be seen except in an imaginary form.
But, (they say,) He calls the invisible Father His face. For who is the
Father? Must He not be the face of the Son, by reason of that authority
which He obtains as the begotten of the Father? For is there not a
natural propriety in saying of some personage greater (than yourself),
That man is my face; he gives me his countenance?  “My Father,” says
*Christ*, “is greater than I.” <span
id="fr_7933"></span>[7934](#fn_7933.md) Therefore the Father must be the
face of the Son. For what does the Scripture say? “The Spirit of His
person is Christ the Lord.” <span id="fr_7934"></span>[7935](#fn_7934.md)
As therefore Christ is the Spirit of the Father’s person, there is good
reason why, in virtue indeed of the unity, the Spirit of Him to whose
person He belonged—that is to say, the Father—pronounced Him to be His
“face.” Now this, to be sure, is an astonishing thing, that the Father
can be taken to be the face of the Son, when He is His head; for “the
head of Christ is God.” <span id="fr_7935"></span>[7936](#fn_7935.md)
