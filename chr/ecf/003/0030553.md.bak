id="v.vi.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.—Diversity in the Opinions
of Secundus, as Compared with the General Doctrine of Valentinus.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxviii-p2"></span>Secundus is a trifle more human, as he
is briefer: he divides the Ogdoad into a pair of Tetrads, a right hand
one and a left hand one, *one* light and *the other* darkness. Only he
is unwilling to derive the power which apostatized and fell away <span
id="fr_6930"></span>[6931](#fn_6930.md) from any one of the Æons, but from
the fruits which issued from their substance.
