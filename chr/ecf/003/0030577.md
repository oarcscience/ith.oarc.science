<span id="v.vii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Holy Scripture in the New
Testament, Even in Its Very First Verse, Testifies to Christ’s True
Flesh.  In Virtue of Which He is Incorporated in the Human Stock of
David, and Abraham, and Adam.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xxii-p2"></span>They may, then, obliterate the testimony
of the devils which proclaimed Jesus the son of David; but whatever
unworthiness there be in this testimony, that of the apostles they will
never be able to efface. There is, first of all, Matthew, that most
faithful chronicler <span id="fr_7242"></span>[7243](#fn_7242.md) of the
Gospel, because the companion of the Lord; for no other reason in the
world than to show us clearly the fleshly original <span
id="fr_7243"></span>[7244](#fn_7243.md) of Christ, he thus begins *his
Gospel*: “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
the son of Abraham.” <span id="fr_7244"></span>[7245](#fn_7244.md) With a
nature issuing from such fountal sources, and an order gradually
descending to the birth of Christ, what else have we here described than
the very flesh of Abraham and of David conveying itself down, step after
step, to the very virgin, and at last introducing Christ,—nay, producing
Christ Himself of the virgin? Then, again, there is Paul, who was at
once both a disciple, and a master, and a witness of the selfsame
Gospel; as an apostle of the same Christ, also, he affirms that Christ
“was made of the seed of David, according to the flesh,” <span
id="fr_7245"></span>[7246](#fn_7245.md) —which, therefore, was His own
likewise.  Christ’s flesh, then, is of David’s seed. Since He is of the
seed of David in consequence of Mary’s flesh, He is therefore of Mary’s
flesh because of the seed of David. In what way so ever you torture the
statement, He is either of the flesh of Mary because of the seed of
David, or He is of the seed of David because of the flesh of Mary. The
whole discussion is terminated by the same apostle, when he declares
Christ to be “the seed of Abraham.” And if of Abraham, how much more, to
be sure, of David, as a more recent *progenitor*! For, unfolding the
promised blessing upon all nations in the person <span
id="fr_7246"></span>[7247](#fn_7246.md) of Abraham, “And in thy seed shall
all nations of the earth be blessed,” he adds, “He saith not, And to
seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is
Christ.” <span id="fr_7247"></span>[7248](#fn_7247.md) When we read and
believe these things, what sort of flesh ought we, and can we,
acknowledge in Christ? Surely none other than Abraham’s, since Christ is
“the seed of Abraham;” none other than Jesse’s, since Christ is the
blossom of “the stem of Jesse;” none other than David’s, since Christ is
“the fruit of David’s loins;” none other than Mary’s, since Christ came
from Mary’s womb; and, higher still, none other than Adam’s, since
Christ is “the second Adam.” The consequence, therefore, is that they
must either maintain, that those (ancestors) had a spiritual flesh, that
so there might be derived to Christ the same condition of substance, or
else allow that the flesh of Christ was not a spiritual one, since it is
not traced from the origin <span id="fr_7248"></span>[7249](#fn_7248.md) of
a spiritual stock.
