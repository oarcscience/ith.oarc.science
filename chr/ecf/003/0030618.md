<span id="v.viii.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—Christ’s Refutation of the
Sadducees, and Affirmation of Catholic Doctrine.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxxvi-p2"></span>Let us now see whether (the Lord) has
not imparted greater strength to our doctrine in breaking down the
subtle cavil of the Sadducees. Their great object, I take it, was to do
away altogether with the resurrection, for the Sadducees in fact did not
admit any salvation either for the soul or the flesh; <span
id="fr_7519"></span>[7520](#fn_7519.md) and therefore, taking the strongest
case they could for impairing the credibility of the resurrection, they
adapted an argument from it in support of the question which they
started. Their specious inquiry concerned the flesh, whether or not it
would be subject to marriage after the resurrection; and they assumed
the case of a woman who had married seven brothers, so that it was a
doubtful point to which of them she should be restored. <span
id="fr_7520"></span>[7521](#fn_7520.md) Now, let the purport both of the
question and the answer be kept steadily in view, and the discussion is
settled at once. For since the Sadducees indeed denied the resurrection,
whilst the Lord affirmed it; since, too, (in affirming it,) He
reproached them as being both ignorant of the Scriptures—those, of
course which had declared the resurrection—as well as incredulous of the
power of God, though, of course, effectual to raise the dead, and
lastly, since He immediately added the words, “Now, that the dead are
raised,” <span id="fr_7521"></span>[7522](#fn_7521) (speaking.md) without
misgiving, and affirming the very thing which was being denied, even the
resurrection of the dead before Him who is “the God of the living,”—(it
clearly follows) that He affirmed this verity in the precise sense in
which they were denying it; that it was, in fact, the resurrection of
the two natures of man. Nor does it follow, (as they would have it,)
that because Christ denied that men would marry, He therefore proved
that they would not rise again. On the contrary, He called them “the
children of the resurrection,” <span
id="fr_7522"></span>[7523](#fn_7522.md) in a certain sense having by the
resurrection to undergo a birth; and after that they marry no more, but
in their risen life are “equal unto the angels,” <span
id="fr_7523"></span>[7524](#fn_7523.md) inasmuch as they are not to marry,
because they are not to die, but are destined to pass into the angelic
state by putting on the raiment of incorruption, although with a change
in the substance which is restored to life. Besides, no question could
be raised whether we are to marry or die again or not, without involving
in doubt the restoration most especially of that substance which has a
particular relation both to death and marriage—that is, the flesh. Thus,
then, you have the Lord affirming against the Jewish heretics what is
now en<span id="page_572">p. 572</span> <span
id="v.viii.xxxvi-Page_572"></span>countering the denial of the Christian
Sadducees—the resurrection of the entire man.
