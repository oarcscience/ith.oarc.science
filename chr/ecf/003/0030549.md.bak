id="v.vi.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—Other Varying Opinions Among
the Valentinians Respecting the Deity, Characteristic Raillery.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxiv-p2"></span>Others of purer mind, mindful of the
honour of the Deity, have, for the purpose of freeing him from the
discredit of even single wedlock, preferred assigning no sex whatever to
Bythus; and therefore very likely they talk of “this deity” in the
neuter gender rather than “this god.” Others again, on the other hand,
speak of him as both masculine and feminine, so that the worthy
chronicler Fenestella must not suppose that an hermaphrodite was only to
be found among the good people of Luna.
