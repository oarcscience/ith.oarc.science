<span id="v.viii.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL.—Sundry Passages of St. Paul Which
Attest Our Doctrine Rescued from the Perversions of Heresy.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xl-p2"></span>Now it is no matter of surprise if
arguments are captiously taken from the writings of (the apostle)
himself, inasmuch as there “must needs be heresies;” <span
id="fr_7542"></span>[7543](#fn_7542.md) but these could not be, if the
Scriptures were not capable of a false interpretation. Well, then,
heresies finding that the apostle had mentioned two “men”—“the inner
man,” that is, the soul, and “the outward man,” that is, the
flesh—awarded salvation to the soul or inward man, and destruction to
the flesh or outward man, because it is written (in the Epistle) to the
Corinthians: “Though our outward man decayeth, yet the inward man is
renewed day by day.” <span id="fr_7543"></span>[7544](#fn_7543.md) Now,
neither the soul by itself alone is “man” (it was subsequently implanted
in the clayey mould to which the name *man* had been already given), nor
is the flesh without the soul “man”: for after the exile of the soul
from it, it has the title of corpse. Thus the designation *man* is, in a
certain sense, the bond between the two closely united substances, under
which designation they cannot but be coherent natures. As for the inward
man, indeed, the apostle prefers its being regarded as the mind and
heart <span id="fr_7544"></span>[7545](#fn_7544.md) rather than the
soul; <span id="fr_7545"></span>[7546](#fn_7545.md) in other words, not so
much the substance itself as the savour of the substance. Thus when,
writing to the Ephesians, he spoke of “Christ dwelling in their inner
man,” he meant, no doubt, that the Lord ought to be admitted into their
senses. <span id="fr_7546"></span>[7547](#fn_7546.md) He then added, “in
your hearts by faith, *rooted and grounded* in love,”—making “faith” and
“love” not substantial parts, but only conceptions of the soul. But when
he used the phrase “in your hearts,” seeing that these are substantial
parts of the flesh, he at once assigned to the flesh the actual “inward
man,” which he placed in the heart. Consider now in what sense he
alleged that “the outward man decayeth, while the inward man is renewed
day by day.” You certainly would not maintain that he could mean that
corruption of the flesh which it undergoes from the moment of death, in
its appointed state of perpetual decay; but *the wear and tear* which
for the name of Christ it experiences during its course of life before
and until death, in harassing cares and tribulations as well as in
tortures and persecutions. Now the inward man will have, of course, to
be renewed by the suggestion of the Spirit, advancing by faith and
holiness day after day, *here* in this life, not *there* after the
resurrection, were our renewal is not a gradual process from day to day,
but a consummation once for all complete. You may learn this, too, from
the following passage, where *the apostle* says: “For our light
affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things
which are seen,” that is, our sufferings, “but at the things which are
not seen,” that is, our rewards: “for the things which are seen are
temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.” <span
id="fr_7547"></span>[7548](#fn_7547.md) For the afflictions and injuries
wherewith the outward man is worn away, he affirms to be only worthy of
being despised by us, as being light and temporary; preferring those
eternal recompenses which are also invisible, and that “weight of glory”
which will be a counterpoise for the labours in the endurance of which
the flesh here suffers decay. So that the subject in this passage is not
that corruption which *they* ascribe to the outward man in the utter
destruction of the flesh, with the view of nullifying the resurrection.
So also he says elsewhere: “If so be that we suffer with Him, that we
may be also glorified together; for I reckon that the sufferings of the
present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be
revealed in us.” <span id="fr_7548"></span>[7549](#fn_7548.md) Here again
he shows us that our sufferings are less than their rewards. Now, since
it is through the flesh that we suffer with *Christ*—for it is the
property of the flesh to be worn by sufferings—to the same flesh belongs
the recompense which is promised for suffering with Christ. Accordingly,
when he is going to assign afflictions to the flesh as its especial
liability—according to the statement he had already made—he says, “When
we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest;” <span
id="fr_7549"></span>[7550](#fn_7549.md) then, in order to make the soul a
fellow-sufferer with the body, he adds, “We were troubled on every side;
without were fightings,” which of course warred down the flesh, “within
were fears,” which afflicted the soul. <span
id="fr_7550"></span>[7551](#fn_7550.md) Although, therefore, the outward
man decays—not in the sense of missing the resurrection, but of enduring
tribulation—it will be under<span id="page_575">p. 575</span> <span
id="v.viii.xl-Page_575"></span>stood from this *scripture* that it is
not exposed to its suffering without the inward man. Both therefore,
will be glorified together, even as they have suffered together.
Parallel with their participation in troubles, must necessarily run
their association also in rewards.
