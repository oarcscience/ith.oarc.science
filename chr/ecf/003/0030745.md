<span id="vi.iv.i-p5"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.i-p5.1"></span>Chapter I.—General Introduction. <span
id="fr_8759"></span>[8760](#fn_8759.md) </span>

<span id="vi.iv.i-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.i-p7.1"></span>The</span> Spirit of God, and the Word of God,
and the Reason of God—Word of Reason, and Reason and Spirit of
Word—Jesus Christ our Lord, namely, who is both the one and the
other, <span id="fr_8760"></span>[8761](#fn_8760.md) —has determined for
us, the disciples of the New Testament, a new form of prayer; for in
this particular also it was needful that new wine should be laid up in
new skins, and a new breadth be sewn to a new garment. <span
id="fr_8761"></span>[8762](#fn_8761.md) Besides, whatever had been in
bygone days, has either been quite changed, as circumcision; or else
supplemented, as the rest of the Law; or else fulfilled, as Prophecy; or
else perfected, as faith itself. For the new grace of God has renewed
all things from carnal unto spiritual, by superinducing the Gospel, the
obliterator of the whole ancient bygone system; in which our Lord Jesus
Christ has been approved as the Spirit of God, and the Word of God, and
the Reason of God: the Spirit, by which He was mighty; the Word, by
which He taught; the Reason, by which He came. <span
id="fr_8762"></span>[8763](#fn_8762.md) So the prayer composed by Christ
has been composed of three parts. In speech, <span
id="fr_8763"></span>[8764](#fn_8763.md) by which *prayer* is enunciated, in
spirit, by which alone it prevails, even John had taught his disciples
to pray, <span id="fr_8764"></span>[8765](#fn_8764.md) but all John’s
doings were laid as groundwork for Christ, until, when “He had
increased”—just as the same John used to fore-announce “that it was
needful” that “He should increase and himself decrease” <span
id="fr_8765"></span>[8766](#fn_8765.md) —the whole work of the forerunner
passed over, together with his spirit itself, unto the Lord. Therefore,
after what form of words John taught to pray is not extant, because
earthly things have given place to heavenly. “He who is from the earth,”
says John, “speaketh earthly things; and He who is here from the heavens
speaketh those things which He hath seen.” <span
id="fr_8766"></span>[8767](#fn_8766.md) And what is the Lord Christ’s—as
this method of praying is—*that* is *not* heavenly? And so, blessed
*brethren*, let us consider His heavenly wisdom: first, touching the
precept of praying secretly, whereby He exacted man’s faith, that he
should be confident that the sight and hearing of Almighty God are
present beneath roofs, and extend even into the secret place; and
required modesty in faith, that it should offer its religious homage to
Him alone, whom it believed to see and to hear everywhere. Further,
since wisdom succeeded in the following precept, let it in like manner
appertain unto faith, and the modesty of faith, that we think not that
the Lord must be approached with a train of words, who, we are certain,
takes unsolicited foresight for His own. And yet that very brevity—and
let this make for the third grade of wisdom—is supported on the
substance of a great and blessed interpretation, and is as diffuse in
meaning as it is compressed in words. For it has embraced not only the
special duties of prayer, be it veneration of God or petition for man,
but almost every discourse of the Lord, every record of *His*
Discipline; so that, in fact, in the Prayer is comprised an epitome of
the whole Gospel.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p8"></span> Oehler’s punctuation is followed here. The
sentence is difficult, and has perplexed editors and commentators
considerably.

referring to the *Adv. Praxeam*, c. 5.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p12"></span> This is Oehler’s punctuation. The edition
of Pamelius reads: “So the prayer composed by Christ was composed of
three parts: of the speech, by which it is enunciated; of the spirit, by
which alone it prevails; of the reason, by which it is taught.” 
Rigaltius and subsequent editors read, “of the reason, by which it is
conceived;” but this last clause is lacking in the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.i-p12.2"></span>mss.</span>, and Oehler’s
reading appears, as he says, to “have healed the words.” \[Oehler’s
punctuation must stand; but, the preceding sentence justifies the
interpolation of Rigaltius and *heals* more effectually.\]
