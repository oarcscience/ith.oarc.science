<span id="iv.viii.i.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III. <span
id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md) —The Great Offence in the Christians
Lies in Their Very Name. The Name Vindicated.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.iii-p3"></span>Since, therefore, you who are in
other cases most scrupulous and persevering in investigating charges of
far less serious import, relinquish your care in cases like ours, which
are so horrible, and of such surpassing sin that *impiety* is too mild a
word for them, by declining to hear confession, which should always be
an important process for those who conduct judicial proceedings; and
failing to make a full inquiry, which should be gone into by such as sue
for a condemnation, it becomes evident that the crime laid to our charge
consists not of any sinful conduct, but lies wholly in our *name*. If,
indeed, <span id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) any real crimes were
clearly adducible against us, their very names would condemn us, if
found applicable, <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) so that
distinct sentences would be pronounced against us in this wise: Let that
murderer, or that incestuous criminal, or whatever it be that we are
charged with, be led to execution, be crucified, or be thrown to the
beasts.  Your sentences, however, <span
id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) import only that one has confessed
himself a Christian. No name of a crime stands against us, but only the
crime of a name. Now this in very deed is neither more nor less
than <span id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) the entire odium which is
felt against us.  The name is the cause: some mysterious force
intensified by your ignorance assails it, so that you do not wish to
know for certain that which for certain you are sure you know nothing
of; and therefore, further, you do not believe things which are not
submitted to proof, and, lest they should be easily refuted, <span
id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) you refuse to make inquiry, so that
the odious name is punished under the presumption of (real) crimes. In
order, therefore, that the issue may be withdrawn from the offensive
name, we are compelled to deny it; then upon our denial we are
acquitted, with an entire absolution <span
id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) for the past: we are no longer
murderers, no longer incestuous, because we have lost that name. <span
id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) But since this point is dealt with in
a place of its own, <span id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) do you tell
us plainly why you are pursuing this name even to extirpation? What
crime, what offence, what fault is there in a name? For you are barred
by the rule <span id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) which puts it out of
your power to allege crimes (of any man), which no legal action moots,
no indictment specifies, no sentence enumerates. In any case which is
submitted to the judge, <span id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md) inquired
into against the defendant, responded to by him or denied, and cited
from the bench, I acknowledge a legal charge.  Concerning, then, the
merit of a name, whatever offence names may be charged with, whatever
impeachment words may be amenable to, I for my part <span
id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) think, that not even a complaint is
due to a word or a name, unless indeed it has a barbarous sound, or
smacks of ill-luck, or is immodest, or is indecorous for the speaker, or
unpleasant to the hearer.  These crimes in (mere) words and names are
just like barbarous words and phrases, which have their fault, and their
solecism, and their absurdity of figure. The name *Christian*, however,
so far as its meaning goes, bears the sense of anointing. Even when by a
faulty pronunciation you call us “Chrestians” (for you are not certain
about even the sound of this noted name), you in fact lisp out the sense
of pleasantness and goodness. <span id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md)
You are therefore vilifying <span id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md) in
harmless men even the harmless name we bear, which is not inconvenient
for the tongue, nor harsh to the ear, nor injurious to a single being,
nor rude for our country, being a good Greek word, as many others also
are, and pleasant in sound and sense. Surely, surely, <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) names are not things which deserve
punishment by the sword, or the cross, or the beasts.
