<span id="v.iv.ii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—The Creator Was Known as the True
God from the First by His Creation. Acknowledged by the Soul and
Conscience of Man Before He Was Revealed by Moses.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.x-p2"></span>For indeed, as the Creator of all things,
He was from the beginning discovered equally with them, they having been
themselves manifested that He might become known as God. For although
Moses, some long while afterwards, seems to have been the first to
introduce the knowledge of <span id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md)
the God of the universe in the temple of his writings, yet the birthday
of that knowledge must not on that account be reckoned from the
Pentateuch. For the volume of Moses does not at all initiate <span
id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443.md) the knowledge of the Creator, but
from the first gives out that it is to be traced from Paradise and Adam,
not from Egypt and Moses. The greater part, therefore, <span
id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444.md) of the human race, although they
knew not even the name of Moses, much less his writings, yet knew the
God of Moses; and even when idolatry overshadowed the world with its
extreme prevalence, men still spoke of Him separately by His own name as
God, and the God of gods, and said, “If God grant,” and, “As God
pleases,” and, “I commend you to God.” <span
id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445.md) Reflect, then, whether they knew
Him, of whom they testify that He can do all things.  To none of the
writings of Moses do they owe this. The soul was before prophecy. <span
id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446.md) From the beginning the knowledge of
God is the dowry of the soul, one and the same amongst the Egyptians,
and the Syrians, and the tribes of Pontus. For their souls call the God
of the Jews their God.  Do not, O barbarian heretic, put Abraham before
the world. Even if the Creator had been the God of one family, He was
yet not later than your god; even in Pontus was He known before him.
Take then your standard from Him who came first: from the Certain (must
be judged) the uncertain; from the Known the unknown. Never shall God be
hidden, never shall God be wanting. Always shall He be understood,
always be heard, nay even seen, in whatsoever way He shall wish. God has
for His witnesses this whole being of ours, and this universe wherein we
dwell.  He is thus, because not unknown, proved to be both God and the
only One, although another still tries hard to make out his claim.
