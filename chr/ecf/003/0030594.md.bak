<span id="v.viii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Some Analogies in Nature Which
Corroborate the Resurrection of the Flesh.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xii-p2"></span>Consider now those very analogies of the
divine power (to which we have just alluded). Day dies into night, and
is buried everywhere in darkness. The glory of the world is obscured in
the shadow of death; its entire substance is tarnished with blackness;
all things become sordid, silent, stupid; everywhere business ceases,
and occupations rest. And so over the loss of the light there is
mourning.  But yet it again revives, with its own beauty, its own dowry,
is own sun, the same as ever, whole and entire, over all the world,
slaying its own death, night—opening its own sepulchre, the
darkness—coming forth the heir to itself, until the night also
revives—it, too, accompanied with a retinue of its own. For the stellar
rays are rekindled, which had been quenched in the morning glow; the
distant groups of the constellations are again brought back to view,
which the *day’s* temporary interval had removed out of sight. Readorned
also are the mirrors of the moon, which her monthly course had worn
away.  Winters and summers return, as do the spring-tide and autumn,
with their resources, their routines, their fruits.  Forasmuch as earth
receives its instruction from heaven to clothe the trees which had been
stripped, to colour the flowers afresh, to spread the grass again, to
reproduce the seed which had been consumed, and not to reproduce them
until consumed. Wondrous method! from a defrauder to be a preserver, in
order to restore, it takes away; in order to guard, it destroys; that it
may make whole, it injures; and that it may enlarge, it first lessens.
(This process) indeed, renders back to us richer and fuller blessings
than it deprived us of—by a destruction which is profit, by an injury
which is advantage, and by a loss which is gain.  In a word, I would
say, all creation is instinct with renewal. Whatever you may chance
upon, has already existed; whatever you have lost, returns again without
fail. All things return to their former state, after having gone out of
sight; all things begin after they have ended; they come to an end for
the very purpose of coming into existence again. Nothing perishes but
with a view to salvation. The whole, therefore, of this revolving order
of things bears witness to the resurrection of the dead. In His works
did God write it, before He wrote it in the Scriptures; He proclaimed it
in His mighty deeds earlier than in His inspired words. He first sent
Nature to you as a teacher, meaning to send Prophecy also as a
supplemental instructor, that, being Nature’s disciple, you may more
easily believe Prophecy, and without hesitation accept (its testimony)
when you come to hear what you have seen already on every side; nor
doubt that <span id="page_554">p. 554</span> <span
id="v.viii.xii-Page_554"></span>God, whom you have discovered to be the
restorer of all things, is likewise the reviver of the flesh. And
surely, as all things rise again for man, for whose use they have been
provided—but not for man except for his flesh also—how happens it that
(the flesh) itself can perish utterly, because of which and for the
service of which nothing comes to nought?
