<span id="v.vi.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—Their Diversity of Sentiment
Affects the Very Central Doctrine of Christianity, Even the Person and
Character of the Lord Jesus. This Diversity Vitiates Every Gnostic
School.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxix-p2"></span>Now, concerning even the Lord Jesus,
into how great a diversity of opinion are they divided! One party form
Him of the blossoms of all the Æons. <span
id="fr_6931"></span>[6932](#fn_6931.md) Another party will have it that He
is made up only of those ten whom *the Word* and *the Life* <span
id="fr_6932"></span>[6933](#fn_6932.md) produced; <span
id="fr_6933"></span>[6934](#fn_6933.md) from which circumstance the titles
of the Word and the Life were suitably transferred to Him. Others,
again, that He rather sprang from the twelve, the offspring of *Man* and
*the Church*, <span id="fr_6934"></span>[6935](#fn_6934.md) and therefore,
they say, He was designated “Son of man.” Others, moreover, maintain
that He was formed by *Christ* and *the Holy Spirit*, who have to
provide for the establishment of the universe, <span
id="fr_6935"></span>[6936](#fn_6935.md) and that He inherits by right His
Father’s appellation. Some there are who have imagined that another
origin must be found for the title “Son of man;” for they have had the
presumption to call the Father Himself *Man*, by reason of the profound
mystery of this title: so that what can you hope for more ample
concerning faith in that God, with whom you are now yourself on a par?
Such conceits are constantly cropping out <span
id="fr_6936"></span>[6937](#fn_6936.md) amongst them, from the redundance
of their mother’s seed. <span id="fr_6937"></span>[6938](#fn_6937.md) And
so it happens that the doctrines which have grown up amongst the
Valentinians have already extended their rank growth to the woods of the
Gnostics.
