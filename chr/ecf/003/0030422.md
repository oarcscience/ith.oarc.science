<span id="v.iv.v.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Impossible that Marcion’s
Christ Should Reprove the Faithless Generation. Such Loving
Consideration for Infants as the True Christ Was Apt to Shew, Also
Impossible for the Other. On the Three Different Characters Confronted
and Instructed by Christ in Samaria.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxiii-p2"></span>I take on myself the character <span
id="fr_4374"></span>[4375](#fn_4374) of Israel. Let Marcion’s Christ
stand forth, and exclaim, “O faithless generation! <span
id="fr_4375"></span>[4376](#fn_4375) how long shall I be with you? how
long shall I suffer you?” <span id="fr_4376"></span>[4377](#fn_4376) He
will immediately have to submit to this remonstrance from me: “Whoever
you are, O stranger, <span id="fr_4377"></span>[4378](#fn_4377) first
tell us who you are, from whom you come, and what right you have over
us. Thus far, all you possess <span id="fr_4378"></span>[4379](#fn_4378)
belongs to the Creator. Of course, if you come from Him, and are acting
for Him, we will bear your reproof. But if you come from some other god,
I should wish you to tell us what you have ever committed to us
belonging to yourself, <span id="fr_4379"></span>[4380](#fn_4379) which
it was our duty to believe, seeing that you are upbraiding us with
‘faithlessness,’ who have never yet revealed to us your own self. How
long ago <span id="fr_4380"></span>[4381](#fn_4380) did you begin to
treat with us, that you should be complaining of the delay? On what
points have you borne with us, that you should adduce <span
id="fr_4381"></span>[4382](#fn_4381) your patience? Like Æsop’s ass, you
are just come from the well, <span id="fr_4382"></span>[4383](#fn_4382)
and are filling every place with your braying.”  I assume,
besides, <span id="fr_4383"></span>[4384](#fn_4383) the person of the
disciple, against whom he has inveighed: <span
id="fr_4384"></span>[4385](#fn_4384) “O perverse nation! how long shall
I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?” This outburst of his I
might, of course, retort upon him most justly in such words as these:
“Whoever you are, O stranger, first tell us who you are, from whom you
come, what right you have over us. Thus far, I suppose, you belong to
the Creator, and so we have followed you, recognising in you all things
which are His. Now, if you come from Him, we will bear your reproof. If,
however, you are acting for another, prythee tell us what you have ever
conferred upon us that is simply your own, which it had become our duty
to believe, seeing that you reproach us with ‘faithlessness,’ although
up to this moment you show us no credentials. How long since did you
begin to plead with us, that you are <span id="page_386">p. 386</span>
<span id="v.iv.v.xxiii-Page_386"></span>charging us with delay? Wherein
have you borne with us, that you should even boast of your patience? The
ass has only just arrived from Æsop’s well, and he is already braying.”
Now who would not thus have rebutted the unfairness of the rebuke, if he
had supposed its author to belong to him who had had no right as yet to
complain?  Except that not even He <span
id="fr_4385"></span>[4386](#fn_4385) would have inveighed against them,
if He had not dwelt among them of old in the law and by the prophets,
and with mighty deeds and many mercies, and had always experienced them
to be “faithless.” But, behold, Christ takes <span
id="fr_4386"></span>[4387](#fn_4386) infants, and teaches how all ought
to be like them, if they ever wish to be greater. <span
id="fr_4387"></span>[4388](#fn_4387) The Creator, on the contrary, <span
id="fr_4388"></span>[4389](#fn_4388) let loose bears against children,
in order to avenge His prophet Elisha, who had been mocked by
them. <span id="fr_4389"></span>[4390](#fn_4389) This antithesis is
impudent enough, since it throws together <span
id="fr_4390"></span>[4391](#fn_4390) things so different as
infants <span id="fr_4391"></span>[4392](#fn_4391) and children, <span
id="fr_4392"></span>[4393](#fn_4392) —an age still innocent, and one
already capable of discretion—able to mock, if not to blaspheme. As
therefore God is a just God, He spared not impious children, exacting as
He does honour for every time of life, and especially, of course, from
youth.  And as God is good, He so loves infants as to have blessed the
midwives in Egypt, when they protected the infants of the Hebrews <span
id="fr_4393"></span>[4394](#fn_4393) which were in peril from Pharaoh’s
command. <span id="fr_4394"></span>[4395](#fn_4394) Christ therefore
shares this kindness with the Creator. As indeed for Marcion’s god, who
is an enemy to marriage, how can he possibly seem to be a lover of
little children, which are simply the issue of marriage? He who hates
the seed must needs also detest the fruit. Yea, he ought to be deemed
more ruthless than the king of Egypt. <span
id="fr_4395"></span>[4396](#fn_4395) For whereas Pharaoh forbade infants
to be brought up, *he* will not allow them even to be born, depriving
them of their ten months’ existence in the womb. And how much more
credible it is, that kindness to little children should be attributed to
Him who blessed matrimony for the procreation of mankind, and in such
benediction included also the promise of connubial fruit itself, the
first of which is that of infancy! <span
id="fr_4396"></span>[4397](#fn_4396) The Creator, at the request of
Elias, inflicts the blow <span id="fr_4397"></span>[4398](#fn_4397) of
fire from heaven in the case of that false prophet (of Baalzebub). <span
id="fr_4398"></span>[4399](#fn_4398) I recognise herein the severity of
the Judge. And I, on the contrary, the severe rebuke <span
id="fr_4399"></span>[4400](#fn_4399) of Christ on His disciples, when
they were for inflicting <span id="fr_4400"></span>[4401](#fn_4400) a
like visitation on that obscure village of the Samaritans. <span
id="fr_4401"></span>[4402](#fn_4401) The heretic, too, may discover that
this gentleness of Christ was promised by the selfsame severest Judge.
“He shall not contend,” says He, “nor shall His voice be heard in the
street; a bruised reed shall He not crush, and smoking flax shall He not
quench.” <span id="fr_4402"></span>[4403](#fn_4402) Being of such a
character, He was of course much the less disposed to burn men. For even
at that time the Lord said to Elias, <span
id="fr_4403"></span>[4404](#fn_4403) “He was not in the fire, but in the
still small voice.” <span id="fr_4404"></span>[4405](#fn_4404) Well, but
why does this most humane and merciful God reject the man who offers
himself to Him as an inseparable companion? <span
id="fr_4405"></span>[4406](#fn_4405) If it were from pride or from
hypocrisy that he had said, “I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou
goest,’ then, by judicially reproving an act of either pride or
hypocrisy as worthy of rejection, He performed the office of a Judge.
And, of course, him whom He rejected He condemned to the loss of not
following the Saviour. <span id="fr_4406"></span>[4407](#fn_4406) For as
He calls to salvation him whom He does not reject, or him whom He
voluntarily invites, so does He consign to perdition him whom He
rejects. When, however, He answers the man, who alleged as an excuse his
father’s burial, “Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach
the kingdom of God,” <span id="fr_4407"></span>[4408](#fn_4407) He gave
a clear confirmation to those two laws of the Creator—that in Leviticus,
which concerns the sacerdotal office, and forbids the priests to be
present at the funerals even of their parents.  “The priest,” says He,
“shall not enter where there is any dead person; <span
id="fr_4408"></span>[4409](#fn_4408) and for his father he shall not be
defiled” <span id="fr_4409"></span>[4410](#fn_4409) ; as well as that in
Numbers, which relates to the (Nazarite) vow of separation; for there he
who devotes himself to God, among other things, is bidden “not to come
at any dead body,” not even of his father, or his mother, or his
brother. <span id="fr_4410"></span>[4411](#fn_4410) Now it was, I
suppose, for the Nazarite and the priestly office that He intended this
man whom <span id="page_387">p. 387</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxiii-Page_387"></span>He had been inspiring <span
id="fr_4411"></span>[4412](#fn_4411) to preach the kingdom of God. Or
else, if it be not so, he must be pronounced impious enough who, without
the intervention of any precept of the law, commanded that burials of
parents should be neglected by their sons. When, indeed, in the third
case before us, (Christ) forbids the man “to look back” who wanted first
“to bid his family farewell,” He only follows out the rule <span
id="fr_4412"></span>[4413](#fn_4412) of the Creator. For this
(retrospection) He had been against their making, whom He had rescued
out of Sodom. <span id="fr_4413"></span>[4414](#fn_4413)
