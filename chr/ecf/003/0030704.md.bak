<span id="v.xi.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.xi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Tatian, Cataphrygians,
Cataproclans, Catæschinetans.</span>

<span id="v.xi.vii-p2"></span>To all these heretics is added one Tatian,
a brother-heretic.  This man was Justin Martyr’s disciple.  After
Justin’s death he began to cherish different opinions from his. For he
wholly savours of Valentinus; adding this, that Adam cannot even attain
salvation:  as if, when the branches become salvable, <span
id="fr_8408"></span>[8409](#fn_8408.md) the root were not!

<span id="v.xi.vii-p4"></span>Other heretics swell the list who are
called Cataphrygians, but their teaching is not uniform. For there are
(of them) *some* who are called Cataproclans; <span
id="fr_8409"></span>[8410](#fn_8409.md) there are others who are termed
Catæschinetans. <span id="fr_8410"></span>[8411](#fn_8410.md) These have a
blasphemy common, and a blasphemy not common, but peculiar and special. 
The common blasphemy lies in their saying that the Holy Spirit was in
the apostles indeed, the Paraclete was not; and in their saying that the
Paraclete has spoken in Montanus more things than Christ brought forward
into (the compass of) the Gospel, and not merely more, but likewise
better and greater. But the particular one they who follow Æschines
have; this, namely, whereby they add this, that they affirm Christ to be
Himself Son and Father.

<span id="v.xi.vii-p3"></span> Salvi. Perhaps if it be questionable
whether this word may be so rendered in a correct Latinist, it may be
lawful to render it so in so incorrect a one as our present author.

<span id="fn_8409"></span>[654:8410](0030704.htm#fr_8409.md) <span
id="v.xi.vii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="v.xi.vii-p5"></span> i.e. followers of Proclus.

<span id="fn_8410"></span>[654:8411](0030704.htm#fr_8410.md) <span
id="v.xi.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.xi.vii-p6"></span> i.e. followers of Æschines. So this
writer takes “Cataphryges” to mean followers of the Phrygians.”
