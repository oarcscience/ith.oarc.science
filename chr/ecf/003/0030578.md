<span id="v.vii.xxiii-Page_541"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Simeon’s “Sign that Should
Be Contradicted,” Applied to the Heretical Gainsaying of the True Birth
of Christ. One of the Heretics’ Paradoxes Turned in Support of Catholic
Truth.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xxiii-p2"></span>We acknowledge, however, that the
prophetic declaration of Simeon is fulfilled, which he spoke over the
recently-born Saviour: <span id="fr_7249"></span>[7250](#fn_7249)
“Behold, this *child* is set for the fall and rising again of many in
Israel, and for a sign that shall be spoken against.” <span
id="fr_7250"></span>[7251](#fn_7250) The sign (here meant) is that of
the birth of Christ, according to Isaiah: “Therefore the Lord Himself
shall give you *a sign*: behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a
son.” <span id="fr_7251"></span>[7252](#fn_7251) We discover, then, what
the sign is which is to be spoken against—the conception and the
parturition of the Virgin Mary, concerning which these sophists <span
id="fr_7252"></span>[7253](#fn_7252) say: “She a virgin and yet not a
virgin bare, and yet did not bear;” just as if such language, if indeed
it must be uttered, would not be more suitable even for ourselves to
use! For “she bare,” because she produced offspring of her own flesh and
“yet she did not bear,” since she produced Him not from a husband’s
seed; she was “a virgin,” so far as (abstinence) from a husband went,
and “yet not a virgin,” as regards her bearing a child. *There is not,
however, that parity of reasoning which the heretics affect: in other
words* it does not follow that for the reason “she did not bear,” <span
id="fr_7253"></span>[7254](#fn_7253) she who was “not a virgin” was “yet
a virgin,” even because she became a mother without any fruit of her own
womb. But with us there is no equivocation, nothing twisted into a
double sense. <span id="fr_7254"></span>[7255](#fn_7254) Light is light;
and darkness, darkness; yea is yea; and nay, nay; “whatsoever is more
than these cometh of evil.” <span id="fr_7255"></span>[7256](#fn_7255)
She who bare (really) bare; and although she was a virgin when she
conceived, she was a wife <span id="fr_7256"></span>[7257](#fn_7256)
when she brought forth *her son*. Now, as a wife, she was under the very
law of “opening the womb,” <span id="fr_7257"></span>[7258](#fn_7257)
wherein it was quite immaterial whether the birth of the male was by
virtue of a husband’s co-operation or not; <span
id="fr_7258"></span>[7259](#fn_7258) it was the same sex <span
id="fr_7259"></span>[7260](#fn_7259) that opened her womb. Indeed, hers
is the womb on account of which it is written of others also: “Every
male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord.” <span
id="fr_7260"></span>[7261](#fn_7260) For who is really holy but the Son
of God? Who properly opened the womb but He who opened *a closed
one*? <span id="fr_7261"></span>[7262](#fn_7261) But it is marriage
which opens the womb in all cases. *The virgin’s womb*, therefore, was
especially <span id="fr_7262"></span>[7263](#fn_7262) opened, because it
was especially closed.  Indeed <span
id="fr_7263"></span>[7264](#fn_7263) she ought rather to be called not a
virgin than a virgin, becoming a mother at a leap, as it were, before
she was a wife.  And what must be said more on this point? Since it was
in this sense that the apostle declared that the Son of God was born not
of a virgin, but “of a woman,” he in that statement recognised the
condition of the “opened womb” which ensues in marriage. <span
id="fr_7264"></span>[7265](#fn_7264) We read in Ezekiel of “a
heifer <span id="fr_7265"></span>[7266](#fn_7265) which brought forth,
and still did not bring forth.” Now, see whether it was not in view of
your own future contentions about the womb of Mary, that even then the
Holy Ghost set His mark upon you in this passage; otherwise <span
id="fr_7266"></span>[7267](#fn_7266) He would not, contrary to His usual
simplicity of style (in this prophet), have uttered a sentence of such
doubtful import, *especially* when Isaiah says, “She shall conceive and
bear a son.” <span id="fr_7267"></span>[7268](#fn_7267)
