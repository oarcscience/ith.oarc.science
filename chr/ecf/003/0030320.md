<span id="v.iv.ii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Marcion Untrue to His Theory. He
Pretends that His Gods are Equal, But He Really Makes Them Diverse. 
Then, Allowing Their Divinity, Denies This Diversity.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.vi-p2"></span>Thus far our discussion seems to imply
that Marcion makes his two gods equal. For while we have been
maintaining that God ought to be believed as the one only great Supreme
Being, excluding from Him every possibility <span
id="fr_2387"></span>[2388](#fn_2387) of equality, we have treated of
these topics on the assumption of two equal *Gods*; but nevertheless, by
teaching that *no* equals can exist according to the law <span
id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388) of the Supreme Being, we have
sufficiently affirmed the impossibility that *two* equals should exist.
For the rest, however, <span id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389) we
know full well <span id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390) that Marcion
makes his gods unequal: one judicial, harsh, mighty in war; the other
mild, placid, and simply <span id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391) good
and excellent. Let us with similar care consider also this aspect of the
question, whether *diversity* (in the Godhead) can at any rate contain
two, since *equality* therein failed to do so. Here again the same rule
about the great Supreme will protect us, inasmuch as it settles <span
id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392) the entire condition of the
Godhead.  Now, challenging, and in a certain sense arresting <span
id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393) the meaning of our adversary, who
does not deny that the Creator is God, I most fairly object <span
id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394) against him that he has no room for
any diversity in his gods, because, having once confessed that they are
on a par, <span id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395) he cannot now
pronounce them different; not indeed that human beings may not be very
different under the same designation, but because the Divine Being can
be neither said nor believed to be God, except as the great Supreme.
Since, therefore, he is obliged to acknowledge that the God whom he does
not deny is the great Supreme, it is inadmissible that he should
predicate of the Supreme Being such a diminution as should subject Him
to another Supreme Being.  For He ceases (to be Supreme), if He becomes
subject to any. Besides, it is not the characteristic of God to cease
from any attribute <span id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396) of His
divinity—say, from His supremacy.  For at this rate the supremacy would
be endangered even in Marcion’s more powerful god, if it were capable of
depreciation in the Creator. When, therefore, two gods are pronounced to
be two great Supremes, it must needs follow that neither of them is
greater or less than the other, neither of them loftier or lowlier than
the other. If you deny <span id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397) him to
be God whom you call inferior, you deny <span
id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398) the supremacy of this inferior
being.  But when you confessed both gods to be divine, you confessed
them both to be supreme. Nothing will you be able to take away from
either of them; nothing will you be able to add. By allowing their
divinity, you have denied their diversity.
