<span id="v.iv.v.xxxi-Page_401"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Christ’s Advice to Invite the
Poor in Accordance with Isaiah. The Parable of the Great Supper a
Pictorial Sketch of the Creator’s Own Dispensations of Mercy and Grace.
The Rejections of the Invitation Paralleled by Quotations from the Old
Testament. Marcion’s Christ Could Not Fulfil the Conditions Indicated in
This Parable.  The Absurdity of the Marcionite Interpretation.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxxi-p2"></span>What kind of persons does He bid should
be invited to a dinner or a supper? <span
id="fr_4725"></span>[4726](#fn_4725.md) Precisely such as he had pointed
out by Isaiah: “Deal thy bread to the hungry man; and the beggars—even
such as have no home—bring in to thine house,” <span
id="fr_4726"></span>[4727](#fn_4726.md) because, no doubt, they are “unable
to recompense” your act of humanity. Now, since Christ forbids the
recompense to be expected now, but promises it “at the resurrection,”
this is the very plan <span id="fr_4727"></span>[4728](#fn_4727.md) of the
Creator, who dislikes those who love gifts and follow after reward.
Consider also to which deity <span id="fr_4728"></span>[4729](#fn_4728.md)
is better suited the parable of him who issued invitations: “A certain
man made a great supper, and bade many.” <span
id="fr_4729"></span>[4730](#fn_4729.md) The preparation for the supper is
no doubt a figure of the abundant provision <span
id="fr_4730"></span>[4731](#fn_4730.md) of eternal life. I first remark,
that strangers, and persons unconnected by ties of relationship, are not
usually invited to a supper; but that members of the household and
family are more frequently the favoured guests. To the Creator, then, it
belonged to give the invitation, to whom also appertained those who were
to be invited—whether considered as *men*, through their descent from
Adam, or as *Jews*, by reason of their fathers; not to him who possessed
no claim to them either by nature or prerogative.  My next remark
is, <span id="fr_4731"></span>[4732](#fn_4731.md) if He issues the
invitations who has prepared the supper, then, in this sense the supper
is the Creator’s, who sent to warn the guests. These had been indeed
previously invited by the fathers, but were to be admonished by the
prophets. *It certainly is not the feast of him* who never sent a
messenger to warn—who never did a thing before towards issuing an
invitation, but came down himself on a sudden—only then <span
id="fr_4732"></span>[4733](#fn_4732.md) beginning to be known, when
already <span id="fr_4733"></span>[4734](#fn_4733.md) giving his
invitation; only then inviting, when already compelling to his banquet;
appointing one and the same hour both for the supper and the invitation.
But when invited, they excuse themselves. <span
id="fr_4734"></span>[4735](#fn_4734.md) And fairly enough, if the
invitation came from the other god, because it was so sudden; if,
however, the excuse was not a fair one, then the invitation was not a
sudden one. Now, if the invitation was not a sudden one, it must have
been given by the Creator—even by Him of old time, whose call they had
at last refused. They first refused it when they said to Aaron, “Make us
gods, which shall go before us;” <span
id="fr_4735"></span>[4736](#fn_4735.md) and again, afterwards, when “they
heard indeed with the ear, but did not understand” <span
id="fr_4736"></span>[4737](#fn_4736.md) their calling of God. In a manner
most germane <span id="fr_4737"></span>[4738](#fn_4737.md) to this parable,
He said by Jeremiah:  “Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye
shall be my people; and ye shall walk in all my ways, which I have
commanded you.” <span id="fr_4738"></span>[4739](#fn_4738.md) This is the
invitation of God. “But,” says He, “they hearkened not, nor inclined
their ear.” <span id="fr_4739"></span>[4740](#fn_4739.md) This is the
refusal of the people. “They departed, and walked every one in the
imagination of their evil heart.” <span
id="fr_4740"></span>[4741](#fn_4740.md) “I have bought a field—and I have
bought some oxen—and I have married a wife.” <span
id="fr_4741"></span>[4742](#fn_4741.md) And still He urges them: “I have
sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early even before
daylight.” <span id="fr_4742"></span>[4743](#fn_4742.md) The Holy Spirit is
here meant, the admonisher of the guests. “Yet my people hearkened not
unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck.” <span
id="fr_4743"></span>[4744](#fn_4743.md) This was reported to the Master of
the family. Then He was moved (He did well to be moved; for, as Marcion
denies emotion to his god, He must be therefore my God), and commanded
them to invite out of “the streets and lanes of the city.” <span
id="fr_4744"></span>[4745](#fn_4744.md) Let us see whether this is not the
same in purport as His words by Jeremiah: “Have I been a wilderness to
the house of Israel, or a land left uncultivated?” <span
id="fr_4745"></span>[4746](#fn_4745.md) That is to say: “Then have I none
whom I may call to me; have I no place whence I may bring them?”  “Since
my people have said, We will come no more unto thee.” <span
id="fr_4746"></span>[4747](#fn_4746.md) Therefore He sent out to call
others, but from the same city. <span
id="fr_4747"></span>[4748](#fn_4747.md) My third remark is this, <span
id="fr_4748"></span>[4749](#fn_4748.md) that although the place abounded
with people, He yet commanded that they gather men from the highways and
the hedges. In other words, we are now gathered out of the <span
id="page_402">p. 402</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxxi-Page_402"></span>Gentile strangers; with that jealous
resentment, no doubt, which He expressed in Deuteronomy: “I will hide my
face from them, and I will show them what shall happen in the last
days <span id="fr_4749"></span>[4750](#fn_4749.md) (how that others shall
possess their place); for they are a froward generation, children in
whom is no faith. They have moved me to jealousy by that which is no
god, and they have provoked me to anger with their idols; and I will
move them to jealousy with those which are not a people: I will provoke
them to anger with a foolish nation” <span
id="fr_4750"></span>[4751](#fn_4750.md) —even with us, whose hope the Jews
still entertain. <span id="fr_4751"></span>[4752](#fn_4751.md) But this
hope the Lord says they should not realize; <span
id="fr_4752"></span>[4753](#fn_4752.md) “Sion being left as a cottage <span
id="fr_4753"></span>[4754](#fn_4753.md) in a vineyard, as a lodge in a
garden of cucumbers,” <span id="fr_4754"></span>[4755](#fn_4754.md) since
the nation rejected the latest invitation to Christ. (Now, I ask,) after
going through all this course of the Creator’s dispensation and
prophecies, what there is in it which can possibly be assigned to him
who has done all his work at one hasty stroke, <span
id="fr_4755"></span>[4756](#fn_4755.md) and possesses neither the
Creator’s <span id="fr_4756"></span>[4757](#fn_4756.md) course nor His
dispensation in harmony with the parable? Or, again in what will consist
his first invitation, <span id="fr_4757"></span>[4758](#fn_4757.md) and
what his admonition <span id="fr_4758"></span>[4759](#fn_4758.md) at the
second stage? Some at first would surely decline; others afterwards must
have accepted.” <span id="fr_4759"></span>[4760](#fn_4759.md) But now he
comes to invite both parties promiscuously out of the city, <span
id="fr_4760"></span>[4761](#fn_4760.md) out of the hedges, <span
id="fr_4761"></span>[4762](#fn_4761.md) contrary to the drift <span
id="fr_4762"></span>[4763](#fn_4762.md) of the parable. It is impossible
for him now to condemn as scorners of his invitation <span
id="fr_4763"></span>[4764](#fn_4763.md) those whom he has never yet
invited, and whom he is approaching with so much earnestness. If,
however, he condemns them beforehand as about to reject his call, then
beforehand he also predicts <span id="fr_4764"></span>[4765](#fn_4764.md)
the election of the Gentiles in their stead.  Certainly <span
id="fr_4765"></span>[4766](#fn_4765.md) he means to come the second time
for the very purpose of preaching to the heathen. But even if he does
mean to come again, I imagine it will not be with the intention of any
longer inviting guests, but of giving to them their places.  Meanwhile,
you who interpret the call to this supper as an invitation to a heavenly
banquet of spiritual satiety and pleasure, must remember that the
earthly promises also of wine and oil and corn, and even of the city,
are equally employed by the Creator as figures of spiritual things.
