<span id="v.iv.v.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—Other Incidents of the
Passion Minutely Compared with Prophecy. Pilate and Herod. Barabbas
Preferred to Jesus. Details of the Crucifixion. The Earthquake and the
Mid-Day Darkness. All Wonderfully Foretold in the Scriptures of the
Creator. Christ’s Giving Up the Ghost No Evidence of Marcion’s Docetic
Opinions. In His Sepulture There is a Refutation Thereof.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xlii-p2"></span>For when He was brought before Pilate,
they proceeded to urge Him with the serious charge <span
id="fr_5120"></span>[5121](#fn_5120.md) , of declaring Himself to be
*Christ the King*; <span id="fr_5121"></span>[5122](#fn_5121.md) that is,
undoubtedly, as the Son of God, who was to sit at God’s right hand. They
would, however, have burdened Him <span
id="fr_5122"></span>[5123](#fn_5122.md) with some other title, if they had
been uncertain whether He had called Himself *the Son of God*—if He had
not pronounced the words, “Ye say that I am,” so as (to admit) that He
was that which they said He was. Likewise, when Pirate asked Him, “Art
thou Christ (the King)?” He answered, as He had before (to the Jewish
council) <span id="fr_5123"></span>[5124](#fn_5123.md) “Thou sayest that I
am” <span id="fr_5124"></span>[5125](#fn_5124.md) in order that He might
not seem to have been driven by a fear of his power to give him a fuller
answer. “And so the Lord hath stood on His trial.” <span
id="fr_5125"></span>[5126](#fn_5125.md) And he placed His people on their
trial. The Lord Himself comes to a trial with “the elders and rulers of
the people,” as Isaiah predicted. <span
id="fr_5126"></span>[5127](#fn_5126.md) And then He fulfilled all that had
been written of His passion. At that time “the heathen raged, and the
people imagined vain things; the kings of the earth set themselves, and
the rulers gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His
Christ.” <span id="fr_5127"></span>[5128](#fn_5127.md) The *heathen* were
Pilate and the Romans; the *people* were the tribes of Israel; the
*kings* were represented in Herod, and the *rulers* in the chief
priests. When, indeed, He was sent to Herod gratuitously <span
id="fr_5128"></span>[5129](#fn_5128.md) by Pilate, <span
id="fr_5129"></span>[5130](#fn_5129.md) the words of Hosea were
accomplished, for he had prophesied of Christ: “And they shall carry Him
bound as a present to the king.” <span
id="fr_5130"></span>[5131](#fn_5130.md) Herod was “exceeding glad” when he
saw Jesus, but he heard not a word from Him. <span
id="fr_5131"></span>[5132](#fn_5131.md) For, “as a lamb before the shearer
is dumb, so He opened not His mouth,” <span
id="fr_5132"></span>[5133](#fn_5132.md) because “the Lord had given to Him
a disciplined tongue, that he might know how and when it behoved Him to
speak” <span id="fr_5133"></span>[5134](#fn_5133.md) —even that “tongue
which clove to His jaws,” as the Psalm <span
id="fr_5134"></span>[5135](#fn_5134.md) said it should, through His not
speaking.  Then Barabbas, the most abandoned criminal, is released, as
if he were the innocent man; while the most righteous Christ is
delivered to be put to death, as if he were the murderer. <span
id="fr_5135"></span>[5136](#fn_5135.md) Moreover two malefactors are
crucified around Him, in order that He might be reckoned amongst the
transgressors. <span id="fr_5136"></span>[5137](#fn_5136.md) Although His
raiment was, without doubt, parted among the soldiers, and partly
distributed by lot, yet Marcion has erased it all (from his
Gospel), <span id="fr_5137"></span>[5138](#fn_5137.md) for he had his eye
upon the Psalm: “They parted my garments amongst them, and cast lots
upon my vesture.” <span id="fr_5138"></span>[5139](#fn_5138.md) You may as
well take away the cross itself! But even then the Psalm is not silent
concerning it: “They pierced my hands and my feet.” <span
id="fr_5139"></span>[5140](#fn_5139.md) Indeed, the details of the whole
event are therein read: “Dogs compassed me about; <span id="page_421">p.
421</span> <span id="v.iv.v.xlii-Page_421"></span>the assembly of the
wicked enclosed me around. All that looked upon me laughed me to scorn;
they did shoot out their lips and shake their heads, (saying,) He hoped
in God, let Him deliver Him.” <span id="fr_5140"></span>[5141](#fn_5140.md)
Of what use now is (your tampering with) the testimony of His garments?
If you take it as a booty for your false Christ, still all the Psalm
(compensates) the vesture of Christ. <span
id="fr_5141"></span>[5142](#fn_5141.md) But, behold, the very elements are
shaken. For their Lord was suffering. If, however, it was their enemy to
whom all this injury was done, the heaven would have gleamed with light,
the sun would have been even more radiant, and the day would have
prolonged its course <span id="fr_5142"></span>[5143](#fn_5142.md) —gladly
gazing at Marcion’s Christ suspended on his gibbet! These proofs <span
id="fr_5143"></span>[5144](#fn_5143.md) would still have been suitable for
me, even if they had not been the subject of prophecy. Isaiah says: “I
will clothe the heavens with blackness.” <span
id="fr_5144"></span>[5145](#fn_5144.md) This will be the day, concerning
which Amos also writes: And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the
Lord, that the sun shall go down at noon and the earth shall be dark in
the clear day.” <span id="fr_5145"></span>[5146](#fn_5145.md) (At
noon) <span id="fr_5146"></span>[5147](#fn_5146.md) the veil of the temple
was rent” <span id="fr_5147"></span>[5148](#fn_5147.md) by the escape of
the cherubim, <span id="fr_5148"></span>[5149](#fn_5148.md) which “left the
daughter of Sion as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of
cucumbers.” <span id="fr_5149"></span>[5150](#fn_5149.md) With what
constancy has He also, in [Psalm
xxx.](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#000.md)<span
id="v.iv.v.xlii-p32.2"></span>, laboured to present to us the very
Christ! He calls with a loud voice to the Father, “Into Thine hands I
commend my spirit,” <span id="fr_5150"></span>[5151](#fn_5150.md) that even
when dying He might expend His last breath in fulfilling the prophets.
Having said this, He gave up the ghost.” <span
id="fr_5151"></span>[5152](#fn_5151.md) Who?  Did the spirit <span
id="fr_5152"></span>[5153](#fn_5152.md) give itself up; or the flesh the
spirit?  But the spirit could not have breathed itself out. That which
breathes is one thing, that which is breathed is another. If the spirit
is breathed it must needs be breathed by another.  If, however, there
had been nothing there but spirit, it would be said to have *departed*
rather than *expired*. <span id="fr_5153"></span>[5154](#fn_5153.md) What,
however, breathes out spirit but the flesh, which both *breathes* the
spirit whilst it has it, and *breathes it out* when it loses it? Indeed,
if it was not flesh (upon the cross), but a phantom <span
id="fr_5154"></span>[5155](#fn_5154.md) of flesh (and <span
id="fr_5155"></span>[5156](#fn_5155.md) a phantom is but spirit, and <span
id="fr_5156"></span>[5157](#fn_5156.md) so the spirit breathed its own self
out, and departed as it did so), no doubt the phantom departed, when the
spirit which was the phantom departed: and so the phantom and the spirit
disappeared together, and were nowhere to be seen. <span
id="fr_5157"></span>[5158](#fn_5157.md) Nothing therefore remained upon the
cross, nothing hung there, after “the giving up of the ghost;” <span
id="fr_5158"></span>[5159](#fn_5158.md) there was nothing to beg of Pilate,
nothing to take down from the cross, nothing to wrap in the linen,
nothing to lay in the new sepulchre. <span
id="fr_5159"></span>[5160](#fn_5159.md) Still it was not *nothing* <span
id="fr_5160"></span>[5161](#fn_5160.md) that was there. What was there,
then? If a phantom Christ was yet there. If Christ had departed, He had
taken away the phantom also. The only shift left to the impudence of the
heretics, is to admit that what remained there was the phantom of a
phantom! But what if Joseph knew that it was a body which he treated
with so much piety? <span id="fr_5161"></span>[5162](#fn_5161.md) That same
Joseph “who had not consented” with the Jews in their crime? <span
id="fr_5162"></span>[5163](#fn_5162.md) The “happy man who walked not in
the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in
the seat of the scornful.” <span id="fr_5163"></span>[5164](#fn_5163.md)

apparent. If Marcion does suppress the details about Christ’s garments
at the cross, to escape the inconvenient proof they afford that Christ
is the object of prophecies, yet there are so many other points of
agreement between this wonderful Psalm and St. Luke’s history of the
crucifixion (not expunged, as it would seem, by the heretic), that they
quite compensate for the loss of this passage about the garments
(Oehler).
