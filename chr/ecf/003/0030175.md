<span id="iv.viii.ii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Gods, Those Which Were
Confessedly Elevated to the Divine Condition, What Pre-Eminent Right Had
They to Such Honour? Hercules an Inferior Character.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xiv-p2"></span>But since they will have it that
those who have been admitted from the human state to the honours of
deification should be kept separate from others, and that the
distinction which Dionysius the Stoic drew should be made between the
native and the factitious <span id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040)
gods, I will add a few words concerning this last class also. I will
take Hercules himself for raising the gist of a reply <span
id="fr_1041"></span>[1042](#fn_1041) (to the question) whether he
deserved heaven and divine honours? For, as men choose to have it, these
honours are awarded to him for his merits. If it was for his valour in
destroying wild beasts with intrepidity, what was there in that so very
memorable? Do not criminals condemned to the games, though they are even
consigned to the contest of the vile arena, despatch several of these
animals at one time, and that with more earnest zeal? If it was for his
world-wide travels, how often has the same thing been accomplished by
the rich at their pleasant leisure, or by philosophers in their
slave-like poverty? <span id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042) Is it
forgotten that the cynic Asclepiades on a single sorry cow, <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043) riding on her back, and sometimes
nourished at her udder, surveyed <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044) the whole world with a personal
inspection?  Even if Hercules visited the infernal regions, who does not
know that the way to Hades is open to all? If you have deified him on
account of his much carnage and many battles, a much greater number of
victories was gained by the <span id="page_144">p. 144</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xiv-Page_144"></span>illustrious Pompey, the conqueror of
the pirates who had not spared Ostia itself in their ravages; and (as to
carnage), how many thousands, let me ask, were cooped up in one corner
of the citadel <span id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045) of Carthage,
and slain by Scipio?  Wherefore Scipio has a better claim to be
considered a fit candidate for deification <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046) than Hercules. You must be still
more careful to add to the claims of (our) Hercules his debaucheries
with concubines *and* wives, and the swathes <span
id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047) of Omphale, and his base desertion
of the Argonauts because he had lost his beautiful boy. <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048) To this mark of baseness add for
his glorification likewise his attacks of madness, adore the arrows
which slew his sons and wife. This was the man who, after deeming
himself worthy of a funeral pile in the anguish of his remorse for his
parricides, <span id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049) deserved rather
to die the unhonoured death which awaited him, arrayed in the poisoned
robe which his wife sent him on account of his lascivious attachment (to
another). You, however, raised him from the pyre to the sky, with the
same facility with which (you have distinguished in like manner) another
hero <span id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050) also, who was destroyed
by the violence of a fire from the gods. He having devised some few
experiments, was said to have restored the dead to life by his cures. He
was the son of Apollo, half human, although the grandson of Jupiter, and
great-grandson of Saturn (or rather of spurious origin, because his
parentage was uncertain, as Socrates of Argon has related; he was
exposed also, and found in a worse tutelage than even Jove’s, suckled
even at the dugs of a dog); nobody can deny that he deserved the end
which befell him when he perished by a stroke of lightning. In this
transaction, however, your most excellent Jupiter is once more found in
the wrong—impious to his grandson, envious of his artistic skill.
Pindar, indeed, has not concealed his true desert; according to him, he
was punished for his avarice and love of gain, influenced by which he
would bring the living to their death, rather than the dead to life, by
the perverted use of his medical art which he put up for sale. <span
id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051) It is said that his mother was
killed by the same stroke, and it was only right that she, who had
bestowed so dangerous a beast on the world, <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052) should escape to heaven by the same
ladder.  And yet the Athenians will not be at a loss how to sacrifice to
gods of such a fashion, for they pay divine honours to Æsculapius and
his mother amongst their dead (worthies). As if, too, they had not ready
to hand <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053) their own Theseus to
worship, so highly deserving a god’s distinction! Well, why not? Did he
not on a foreign shore abandon the preserver of his life, <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054) with the same indifference, nay
heartlessness, <span id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055) with which he
became the cause of his father’s death?

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xiv-p14"></span> Tertullian does not correctly
quote Pindar (*Pyth*. iii. 54–59), who notices the skilful hero’s love
of reward, but certainly ascribes to him the merit of curing rather than
killing:  <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xiv-p14.1"></span>Αλλὰ κέρδει καὶ σοφία δέδεται ἔτραπεν
καὶ κᾀκεῖνον ἁγάνορι μισθῷ χρυσὸς ἐν χερσὶν φανεὶς ἂνδῤ ἐκ θανάτου
κομίσαι ἢδη ἀλωκότα· χερσὶ δ᾽ ἄρα Κρονίων ῥίψαις δἰ ἄμφοῖν ἀμπνοὰν
στέρνων καθέλεν ὠκέως, αἴθων δὲ κεραυνὸς ἐνέσκιμψεν μόρον</span>—“Even
wisdom has been bound by love of gain, and gold shining in the hand by a
magnificent reward induced even him to restore from death a man already
seized by it; and then the son of Saturn, hurling with his hands a bolt
through both, speedily took away the breath of their breasts, and the
flashing bolt inflicted death” (Dawson Turner).

id="iv.viii.ii.xiv-p14.2"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xiv-p15"></span> Tertullian does not follow the
legend which is usually received.  He wishes to see no good in the
object of his hatred, and so takes the worst view, and certainly
*improves* upon it. The “bestia” is out of reason. \[He doubtless
followed some copy now lost.\]
