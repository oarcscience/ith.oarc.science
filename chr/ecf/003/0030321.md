<span id="v.iv.ii.vii"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Other Beings Besides God are
in Scripture Called God.  This Objection Frivolous, for It is Not a
Question of Names. The Divine Essence is the Thing at Issue. Heresy, in
Its General Terms, Thus Far Treated.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.vii-p2"></span>But this argument you will try to shake
with an objection from the name of God, by alleging that that name is a
vague <span id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399.md) one, and applied to
other beings also; as it is written, “God standeth in the congregation
of the mighty; <span id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400.md) He judgeth
among the gods.” And again, “I have said, Ye are gods.” <span
id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401.md) As therefore the attribute of
supremacy would be inappropriate to these, although they are called
gods, so is it to the Creator. This is a foolish objection; and my
answer to it is, that its author fails to consider that quite as strong
an objection might be urged against the (superior) god of Marcion: he
too is called god, but is not on that account proved to be divine, as
neither are angels nor men, the Creator’s *handiwork*. If an identity of
names affords a presumption in support of equality of condition, how
often do worthless menials strut insolently in the names of kings—your
Alexanders, Cæsars, and Pompeys! <span
id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402.md) This fact, <span id="page_276">p.
276</span> <span id="v.iv.ii.vii-Page_276"></span>however, does not
detract from the real attributes of the royal persons.  Nay more, the
very idols of the Gentiles are called gods. Yet not one of them is
divine because he is called a god. It is not, therefore, for the name of
god, for its sound or its written form, that I am claiming the supremacy
in the Creator, but for the essence <span
id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403.md) to which the name belongs; and when
I find that essence alone is unbegotten and unmade—alone eternal, and
the maker of all things—it is not to its name, but its state, not to its
designation, but its condition, that I ascribe and appropriate the
attribute of the supremacy.  And so, because the essence to which I
ascribe it has come <span id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404.md) to be
called god, you suppose that I ascribe it to the name, because I must
needs use a name to express the essence, of which indeed that Being
consists who is called God, and who is accounted the great Supreme
because of His essence, not from His name. In short, Marcion himself,
when he imputes this character to his god, imputes it to the
nature, <span id="fr_2405"></span>[2406](#fn_2405.md) not to the word. That
supremacy, then, which we ascribe to God in consideration of His
essence, and not because of His name, ought, as we maintain, to be
equal <span id="fr_2406"></span>[2407](#fn_2406.md) in both the beings who
consist of that substance for which the name of God is given; because,
in as far as they are called gods (*i.e.* supreme beings, on the
strength, of course, of their unbegotten and eternal, and therefore
great and supreme essence), in so far the attribute of being the great
Supreme cannot be regarded as less or worse in one than in another great
Supreme. If the happiness, and sublimity, and perfection <span
id="fr_2407"></span>[2408](#fn_2407.md) of the Supreme Being shall hold
good of Marcion’s god, it will equally so of ours; and if not of ours,
it will equally not *hold* of Marcion’s. Therefore two supreme beings
will be neither equal nor unequal: not equal, because the principle
which we have just expounded, that the Supreme Being admits of no
comparison with Himself, forbids it; not unequal, because another
principle meets us respecting the Supreme Being, that He is capable of
no diminution. So, Marcion, you are caught <span
id="fr_2408"></span>[2409](#fn_2408.md) in the midst of your own Pontic
tide.  The waves of truth overwhelm you on every side. You can neither
set up equal gods nor unequal ones. For there are not two; so far as the
question of *number* is properly concerned. Although the whole matter of
the two gods is at issue, we have yet confined our discussion to certain
bounds, within which we shall now have to contend about separate
peculiarities.
