<span id="v.iv.ii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Notwithstanding Their
Conceits, the God of the Marcionites Fails in the Vouchers Both of
Created Evidence and of Adequate Revelation.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xviii-p2"></span>Well, then, <span
id="fr_2530"></span>[2531](#fn_2530.md) he has now advanced into notice,
just when he willed, when he could, when the destined hour arrived. For
perhaps he was hindered hitherto by his leading star, <span
id="fr_2531"></span>[2532](#fn_2531.md) or some weird malignants, or Saturn
in quadrature, <span id="fr_2532"></span>[2533](#fn_2532.md) or Mars at the
trine. <span id="fr_2533"></span>[2534](#fn_2533.md) The Marcionites are
very strongly addicted to astrology; nor do they blush to get their
livelihood by help of the very stars which were made by the Creator
(whom they depreciate). We must here also treat of the quality <span
id="fr_2534"></span>[2535](#fn_2534) of the (new.md) revelation; whether
Marcion’s supreme god has become known *in a way worthy of him*, so as
to secure the proof of his existence: and *in the way of truth*, so that
he may be believed to be the very being who had been already proved to
have been revealed in a manner worthy of his character. For things which
are worthy of God will prove the existence of God. We maintain <span
id="fr_2535"></span>[2536](#fn_2535.md) that God must first be known <span
id="fr_2536"></span>[2537](#fn_2536.md) from *nature*, and afterwards
authenticated <span id="fr_2537"></span>[2538](#fn_2537.md) by
*instruction*: from nature by His works; by instruction, <span
id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538.md) through His revealed
announcements. <span id="fr_2539"></span>[2540](#fn_2539.md) Now, in a case
where nature is excluded, no natural means (of knowledge) are
furnished.  He ought, therefore, to have carefully supplied <span
id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540.md) a revelation of himself, even by
announcements, especially as he had to be revealed in opposition to One
who, after so many and so great works, both of creation and revealed
announcement, had with difficulty succeeded in satisfying <span
id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541.md) men’s faith. In what manner,
therefore, has the revelation been made? If by man’s conjectural
guesses, do not say that God can possibly become known in any other way
than by Himself, and appeal not only to the standard of the Creator, but
to the conditions both of God’s greatness and man’s littleness; so that
man seem not by any possibility to be greater than God, by having
somehow drawn Him out into public recognition, when He was Himself
unwilling to become known by His own energies, although man’s littleness
has been able, according to experiments all over the world, more easily
to fashion for itself gods, than to follow the true God whom men now
understand by nature. As for the rest, <span
id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542.md) if man shall be thus able to devise
a god,—as Romulus did Consus, and Tatius Cloacina, and Hostilius Fear,
and Metellus Alburnus, and a certain authority <span
id="fr_2543"></span>[2544](#fn_2543.md) some time since Antinous,—the same
accomplishment may be allowed to others. As for us, we have found our
pilot in Marcion, although not a king nor an emperor.
