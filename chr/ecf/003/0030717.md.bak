<span id="vi.ii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Concerning the Outward
Manifestations by Which This Second Repentance is to Be
Accompanied.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p2"></span>The narrower, then, the sphere of action
of this second and only (remaining) repentance, the more laborious is
its probation; in order that it may not be exhibited in the conscience
alone, but may likewise be carried out in some (external) act. This act,
which is more usually expressed and commonly spoken of under a Greek
name, is <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.ix-p2.1"></span>ἐξομολόγησις</span> , <span
id="fr_8505"></span>[8506](#fn_8505.md) whereby we confess our sins to the
Lord, not indeed as if He were ignorant of them, but inasmuch as by
confession satisfaction is settled, <span
id="fr_8506"></span>[8507](#fn_8506.md) of confession repentance is born;
by repentance God is appeased. And thus *exomologesis* is a discipline
for man’s prostration and humiliation, enjoining a demeanor calculated
to move mercy. With regard also to the very dress and food, it commands
(the penitent) to lie in sackcloth and ashes, to cover his body in
mourning, <span id="fr_8507"></span>[8508](#fn_8507.md) to lay his spirit
low in sorrows, to exchange for severe treatment the sins which he has
committed; moreover, to know no food and drink but such as is plain,—not
for the stomach’s sake, to wit, but the soul’s; for the most part,
however, to feed prayers on fastings, to groan, to weep and make
outcries <span id="fr_8508"></span>[8509](#fn_8508.md) unto the Lord
your <span id="fr_8509"></span>[8510](#fn_8509.md) God; to bow before the
feet of the presbyters, and kneel to God’s dear ones; to enjoin on all
the brethren to be ambassadors to bear his <span
id="fr_8510"></span>[8511](#fn_8510.md) deprecatory supplication (before
God).  All this *exomologesis* (does), that it may enhance repentance;
may honour God by its fear of the (incurred) danger; may, by itself
pronouncing against the sinner, stand in the stead of God’s indignation,
and by temporal mortification (I will not say frustrate, but) expunge
eternal punishments. Therefore, while it abases the man, it raises him;
while it covers him with squalor, it renders him more clean; while it
*ac*cuses, it *ex*cuses; while it condemns, it absolves. The less
quarter you give yourself, the more (believe me) will God give you.
