<span id="v.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Warnings Against Heresy Given Us
in the New Testament. Sundry Passages Adduced. These Imply the
Possibility of Falling into Heresy.</span>

<span id="v.iii.iv-p2"></span>But let us rather be mindful of the
sayings of the Lord, and of the letters of the apostles; <span
id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span id="v.iii.iv-Page_245"></span>for they
have both told us beforehand that there shall be heresies, and have
given us, in anticipation, warnings to avoid them; and inasmuch as we
are not alarmed because they exist, so we ought not to wonder that they
are capable of doing that, on account of which they must be shunned. The
Lord teaches us that many “ravening wolves shall come in sheep’s
clothing.” <span id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882) Now, what are
these sheep’s clothing’s, but the external surface of the Christian
profession? Who are the ravening wolves but those deceitful senses and
spirits which are lurking within to waste the flock of Christ? Who are
the false prophets but deceptive predictors of the future? Who are the
false apostles but the preachers of a spurious gospel? <span
id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883) Who also are the Antichrists, both
now and evermore, but the men who rebel against Christ? <span
id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884) Heresies, at the present time, will
no less rend the church by their perversion of doctrine, than will
Antichrist persecute her at that day by the cruelty of his
attacks, <span id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885) except that
persecution make seven martyrs, (but) heresy only apostates. And
therefore “heresies must needs be in order that they which are approved
might be made manifest,” <span id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886) both
those who remained stedfast under persecution, and those who did not
wander out of their way <span id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887) into
heresy. For *the apostle* does not mean <span
id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888) that those persons should be deemed
*approved* who exchange their creed for heresy; although they
contrariously interpret his words to their own side, when he says in
another passage, “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good;” <span
id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889) as if, after proving all things
amiss, one might not through error make a determined choice of some evil
thing.
