<span id="v.iii.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—What St. Paul Calls
Spiritual Wickednesses Displayed by Pagan Authors, and by Heretics, in
No Dissimilar Manner. Holy Scripture Especially Liable to Heretical
Manipulation.  Affords Material for Heresies, Just as Virgil Has Been
the Groundwork of Literary Plagiarisms, Different in Purport from the
Original.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxxix-p2"></span>These were the ingenious arts of
“spiritual wickednesses,” <span id="fr_2258"></span>[2259](#fn_2258)
wherewith we also, my brethren, may fairly expect to have “to wrestle,”
as necessary for faith, that the elect may be made manifest, (and) that
the reprobate may be discovered. And therefore they possess influence,
and a facility in thinking out and fabricating <span
id="fr_2259"></span>[2260](#fn_2259) errors, which ought not to be
wondered at as if it were a difficult and inexplicable process, seeing
that in profane writings also an example comes ready to hand of a
similar facility. You see in our own day, composed out of Virgil, <span
id="fr_2260"></span>[2261](#fn_2260) a story of a wholly different
character, the subject-matter being arranged according to the verse, and
the verse according to the subject-matter. In short, <span
id="fr_2261"></span>[2262](#fn_2261) Hosidius Geta has most completely
pilfered his tragedy of *Medea* from Virgil. A near relative of my own,
among some leisure productions <span
id="fr_2262"></span>[2263](#fn_2262) of his pen, has composed out of the
same poet *The Table of Cebes*. On the same principle, those
*poetasters* are commonly called *Homerocentones*, “collectors of
Homeric odds and ends,” who stitch into one piece, patchwork fashion,
works of their own from the lines of Homer, out of many scraps put
together from this passage and from that (in miscellaneous confusion).
Now, unquestionably, the Divine Scriptures are more fruitful in
resources of all kinds for this sort of facility. Nor do I risk
contradiction in saying <span id="fr_2263"></span>[2264](#fn_2263) that
the very Scriptures were even arranged by the will of God in such a
manner as to furnish materials for heretics, inasmuch as I read that
“there must be heresies,” <span id="fr_2264"></span>[2265](#fn_2264)
which there cannot be without the Scriptures.
