<span id="iv.xi.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Plato’s Inconsistency. He
Supposes the Soul Self-Existent, Yet Capable of Forgetting What Passed
in a Previous State.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xxiv-p2"></span>In the first place, I cannot allow that
the soul is capable of a failure of memory; because he has conceded to
it so large an amount of divine quality as to put it on a par with God.
He makes it *unborn*, which single attribute I might apply as a
sufficient attestation of its perfect divinity; he then adds that the
soul is immortal, incorruptible, incorporeal—since he believed God to be
the same—invisible, incapable of delineation, uniform, supreme,
rational, and intellectual. What more could he attribute to the soul, if
he wanted to call it God? We, however, who allow no appendage to
God <span id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664.md) (in the sense of
equality), by this very fact reckon the soul as very far below God: for
we suppose it to be born, and hereby to possess something of a diluted
divinity and an attenuated felicity, as the breath (of God), though not
His spirit; and although immortal, as this is an attribute of divinity,
yet for all that passible, since this is an incident of a born
condition, and consequently from the first capable of deviation from
perfection and right, <span id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665.md) and by
consequence susceptible of a failure in memory. This point I have
discussed sufficiently with Hermogenes. <span
id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666.md) But it may be further observed,
that if the soul is to merit being accounted a god, by reason of all its
qualities being equal to the attributes of God, it must then be subject
to no passion, and therefore to no loss of memory; for this defect of
oblivion is as great an injury to that of which you predicate it, as
memory is the glory thereof, which Plato himself deems the very
safeguard of the senses and intellectual faculties, and which Cicero has
designated the treasury of all the sciences. Now we need not raise the
doubt whether so divine a faculty as the soul was capable of losing
memory: the question rather is, whether it is able to recover afresh
that which it has lost. I could not decide whether that, which ought to
have lost memory, if it once incurred the loss, would be powerful enough
to recollect itself. Both alternatives, <span id="page_204">p.
204</span> <span id="iv.xi.xxiv-Page_204"></span>indeed, will agree very
well with my soul, but not with Plato’s. In the second place, my
objection to him will stand thus: (Plato,) do you endow the soul with a
natural competency for understanding those well-known *ideas* of yours?
Certainly I do, will be your answer. Well, now, no one will concede to
you that the knowledge, (which you say is) the gift of nature, of the
natural sciences can fail.  But the knowledge of the sciences fails; the
knowledge of the various fields of learning and of the arts of life
fails; and so perhaps the knowledge of the faculties and affections of
our minds fails, although they seem to be inherent in our nature, but
really are not so:  because, as we have already said, <span
id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667.md) they are affected by accidents of
place, of manners and customs, of bodily condition, of the state of
man’s health—by the influences of the Supreme Powers, and the changes of
man’s free-will.  Now the instinctive knowledge of natural objects never
fails, not even in the brute creation. The lion, no doubt, will forget
his ferocity, if surrounded by the softening influence of training; he
may become, with his beautiful mane, the plaything of some Queen
Berenice, and lick her cheeks with his tongue.  A wild beast may lay
aside his habits, but his natural instincts will not be forgotten. He
will not forget his proper food, nor his natural resources, nor his
natural alarms; and should the queen offer him fishes or cakes, he will
wish for flesh; and if, when he is ill, any antidote be prepared for
him, he will still require the ape; and should no hunting-spear be
presented against him, he will yet dread the crow of the cock. In like
manner with man, who is perhaps the most forgetful of all creatures, the
knowledge of everything natural to him will remain ineradicably fixed in
him,—but this alone, as being alone a natural instinct. He will never
forget to eat when he is hungry; or to drink when he is thirsty; or to
use his eyes when he wants to see; or his ears, to hear; or his nose, to
smell; or his mouth, to taste; or his hand, to touch.  These are, to be
sure, the senses, which philosophy depreciates by her preference for the
intellectual faculties.  But if the natural knowledge of the sensuous
faculties is permanent, how happens it that the knowledge of the
intellectual faculties fails, to which the superiority is ascribed?
Whence, now, arises that power of forgetfulness itself which precedes
recollection? From long lapse of time, he says. But this is a
shortsighted answer. Length of time cannot be incidental to that which,
according to him, is unborn, and which therefore must be deemed most
certainly eternal. For that which is eternal, on the ground of its being
unborn, since it admits neither of beginning nor end of time, is subject
to no *temporal* criterion. And that which time does not measure,
undergoes no change in consequence of time; nor is long lapse of time at
all influential over it. If time is a cause of oblivion, why, from the
time of the soul’s entrance into the body, does memory fail, as if
thenceforth the soul were to be affected by time? for the soul, being
undoubtedly prior to the body, was of course not irrespective of time.
Is it, indeed, immediately on the soul’s entrance into the body that
oblivion takes place, or some time afterwards? If immediately, where
will be the long lapse of the time which is as yet inadmissible in the
hypothesis? <span id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668.md) Take, for
instance, the case of the infant. If some time afterwards, will not the
soul, during the interval previous to the moment of oblivion, still
exercise its powers of memory? And how comes it to pass that the soul
subsequently forgets, and then afterwards again remembers? How long,
too, must the lapse of the time be regarded as having been, during which
the oblivion oppressed the soul? The whole course of one’s life, I
apprehend, will be insufficient to efface the memory of an age which
endured so long before the soul’s assumption of the body.  But then,
again, Plato throws the blame upon the body, as if it were at all
credible that a born substance could extinguish the power of one that is
unborn. There exist, however, among bodies a great many differences, by
reason of their rationality, their bulk, their condition, their age, and
their health.  Will there then be supposed to exist similar differences
in obliviousness? Oblivion, however, is uniform and identical. Therefore
bodily peculiarity, with its manifold varieties, will not become the
cause of an effect which is an invariable one. There are likewise,
according to Plato’s own testimony, many proofs to show that the soul
has a divining faculty, as we have already advanced against Hermogenes.
But there is not a man living, who does not himself feel his soul
possessed with a presage and augury of some omen, danger, or joy. Now,
if the body is not prejudicial to divination, it will not, I suppose, be
injurious to memory. One thing is certain, that souls in the same body
both forget and remember. If any corporeal condition engenders
forgetfulness, how will it admit the opposite state of recollection?
Because recollection, after forgetfulness, is <span id="page_205">p.
205</span> <span id="iv.xi.xxiv-Page_205"></span>actually the
resurrection of the memory. Now, how should not that which is hostile to
the memory at first, be also prejudicial to it in the second instance?
Lastly, who have better memories than little children, with their fresh,
unworn souls, not yet immersed in domestic and public cares, but devoted
only to those studies the acquirement of which is itself a reminiscence?
Why, indeed, do we not all of us recollect in an equal degree, since we
are equal in our forgetfulness? But this is true only of philosophers!
But not even of the whole of them. Amongst so many nations, in so great
a crowd of sages, Plato, to be sure, is the only man who has combined
the oblivion and the recollection of ideas. Now, since this main
argument of his by no means keeps its ground, it follows that its entire
superstructure must fall with it, namely, that souls are supposed to be
unborn, and to live in the heavenly regions, and to be instructed in the
divine mysteries thereof; moreover, that they descend to this earth, and
here recall to memory their previous existence, for the purpose, of
course, of supplying to our heretics the fitting materials for their
systems.
