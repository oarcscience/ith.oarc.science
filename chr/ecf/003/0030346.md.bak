<span id="v.iv.iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—The True Doctrine of God the
Creator. The Heretics Pretended to a Knowledge of the Divine Being,
Opposed to and Subversive of Revelation. God’s Nature and Ways Past
Human Discovery. Adam’s Heresy.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.ii-p2"></span>We have now, then, cleared our way to
the contemplation of the Almighty God, the Lord and Maker of the
universe. His greatness, as I think, is shown in this, that from the
beginning He made Himself known: He never hid Himself, but always shone
out brightly, even before the time of Romulus, to say nothing of that of
Tiberius; with the exception indeed that the heretics, and they alone,
know Him not, although they take such pains about Him. They on this
account suppose that another god must be assumed to exist, because they
are more able to censure than deny Him whose existence is so evident,
deriving all their thoughts about God from the deductions of sense; just
as if some blind man, or a man of imperfect vision, <span
id="fr_2699"></span>[2700](#fn_2699.md) chose to assume some other sun of
milder and healthier ray, because he sees not that which is the object
of sight. <span id="fr_2700"></span>[2701](#fn_2700.md) There is, O <span
id="page_298">p. 298</span> <span id="v.iv.iii.ii-Page_298"></span>man,
but one sun which rules <span id="fr_2701"></span>[2702](#fn_2701.md) this
world and even when you think otherwise of him, he is best and useful;
and although to you he may seem too fierce and baneful, or else, it may
be, too sordid and corrupt, he yet is true to the laws of his own
existence. Unable as you are to see through those laws, you would be
equally impotent to bear the rays of any other sun, were there one,
however great and good. Now, you whose sight is defective <span
id="fr_2702"></span>[2703](#fn_2702.md) in respect of the inferior god,
what is your view of the sublimer One? Really you are too lenient <span
id="fr_2703"></span>[2704](#fn_2703.md) to your weakness; and set not
yourself to the proof <span id="fr_2704"></span>[2705](#fn_2704.md) of
things, holding God to be certainly, undoubtedly, and therefore
sufficiently known, the very moment you have discovered Him to exist,
though you know Him not except on the side where He has willed His
proofs to lie. But you do not even deny God intelligently, <span
id="fr_2705"></span>[2706](#fn_2705.md) you treat of Him ignorantly; <span
id="fr_2706"></span>[2707](#fn_2706.md) nay, you accuse Him with a
semblance of intelligence, <span id="fr_2707"></span>[2708](#fn_2707.md)
whom if you did but know Him, you would never accuse, nay, never treat
of. <span id="fr_2708"></span>[2709](#fn_2708.md) You give Him His name
indeed, but you deny the essential truth of that name, that is, the
greatness which is called God; not acknowledging it to be such as, were
it possible for it to have been known to man in every respect, <span
id="fr_2709"></span>[2710](#fn_2709.md) would not be greatness. Isaiah even
so early, with the clearness of an apostle, foreseeing the thoughts of
heretical hearts, asked, “Who hath known the mind of the Lord? For who
hath been His counsellor? With whom took He counsel?…or who taught Him
knowledge, and showed to Him the way of understanding?” <span
id="fr_2710"></span>[2711](#fn_2710.md) With whom the apostle agreeing
exclaims, “Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge
of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding
out!” <span id="fr_2711"></span>[2712](#fn_2711.md) “His judgments
unsearchable,” as being those of God the Judge; and “His ways past
finding out,” as comprising an understanding and knowledge which no man
has ever shown to Him, except it may be those critics of the Divine
Being, who say, God ought not to have been this, <span
id="fr_2712"></span>[2713](#fn_2712.md) and He ought rather to have been
that; as if any one knew what is in God, except the Spirit of God. <span
id="fr_2713"></span>[2714](#fn_2713.md) Moreover, having the spirit of the
world, and “in the wisdom of God by wisdom knowing not God,” <span
id="fr_2714"></span>[2715](#fn_2714.md) they seem to themselves to be
wiser <span id="fr_2715"></span>[2716](#fn_2715.md) than God; because, as
the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God, so also the wisdom of
God is folly in the world’s esteem. We, however, know that “the
foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is
stronger than men.” <span id="fr_2716"></span>[2717](#fn_2716.md)
Accordingly, God is then especially great, when He is small <span
id="fr_2717"></span>[2718](#fn_2717.md) to man; then especially good, when
not good in man’s judgment; then especially unique, when He seems to man
to be two or more.  Now, if from the very first “the natural man, not
receiving the things of the Spirit of God,” <span
id="fr_2718"></span>[2719](#fn_2718.md) has deemed God’s law to be
foolishness, and has therefore neglected to observe it; and as a further
consequence, by his not having faith, “even that which he seemeth to
have hath been taken from him” <span
id="fr_2719"></span>[2720](#fn_2719.md) —such as the grace of paradise and
the friendship of God, by means of which he might have known all things
of God, if he had continued in his obedience—what wonder is it, if
he, <span id="fr_2720"></span>[2721](#fn_2720.md) reduced to his material
nature, and banished to the toil of tilling the ground, has in his very
labour, downcast and earth-gravitating as it was, handed on that
earth-derived spirit of the world to his entire race, wholly
natural <span id="fr_2721"></span>[2722](#fn_2721.md) and heretical as it
is, and not receiving the things which belong to God? Or who will
hesitate to declare the great sin of Adam to have been heresy, when he
committed it by the choice <span id="fr_2722"></span>[2723](#fn_2722.md) of
his own will rather than of God’s?  Except that Adam never said to his
fig-tree, Why hast thou made me thus? He confessed that he was led
astray; and he did not conceal the seducer.  He was a very rude heretic.
He was disobedient; but yet he did not blaspheme his Creator, nor blame
that Author of his being, Whom from the beginning of his life he had
found to be so good and excellent, and Whom he had perhaps <span
id="fr_2723"></span>[2724](#fn_2723.md) made his own judge from the very
first.
