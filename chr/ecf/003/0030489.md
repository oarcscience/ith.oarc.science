<span id="v.v.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Meaning of the Phrase—In the
Beginning. Tertullian Connects It with the Wisdom of God, and Elicits
from It the Truth that the Creation Was Not Out of Pre-Existent
Matter.</span>

<span id="v.v.xx-p2"></span>But in proof that the Greek word means
nothing else than beginning, and that *beginning* admits of no other
sense than the *initial* one, we have that (Being) <span
id="fr_6322"></span>[6323](#fn_6322.md) even acknowledging such a
beginning, who says:  “The Lord possessed <span
id="fr_6323"></span>[6324](#fn_6323.md) me, the beginning of His ways for
the creation of His works.” <span id="fr_6324"></span>[6325](#fn_6324.md)
For since all things were made by the Wisdom of God, it follows that,
when God made both the heaven and the earth *in principio*—that is to
say, in the beginning—He made them in His Wisdom. If, indeed, beginning
had a *material* signification, the Scripture would not have informed us
that God made so and so *in principio*, at the beginning, but rather *ex
principio*, of the beginning; for He would not have created *in*, but
*of*, matter. When Wisdom, however, was referred to, it was quite right
to say, in the beginning.  For it was in Wisdom that He made all things
at first, because by meditating and arranging His plans therein, <span
id="fr_6325"></span>[6326](#fn_6325.md) He had in fact already done (the
work of creation); and if He had even intended to create out of matter,
He would yet have effected His creation when He previously medi<span
id="page_489">p. 489</span> <span id="v.v.xx-Page_489"></span>tated on
it and arranged it in His Wisdom, since It <span
id="fr_6326"></span>[6327](#fn_6326.md) was in fact the beginning of His
ways:  this meditation and arrangement being the primal operation of
Wisdom, opening as it does the way to the works by the act of meditation
and thought. <span id="fr_6327"></span>[6328](#fn_6327.md) This authority
of Scripture I claim for myself even from this circumstance, that whilst
it shows me the God who created, and the works He created, it does not
in like manner reveal to me the source from which He created. For since
in every operation there are three principal things, He who makes, and
that which is made, and that of which it is made, there must be three
names mentioned in a correct narrative of the operation—the person of
the maker the sort of thing which is made, <span
id="fr_6328"></span>[6329](#fn_6328.md) *and* the material of which it is
formed. If the material is not mentioned, while the work and the maker
of the work are both mentioned, it is manifest that He made the work out
of nothing.  For if He had had anything to operate upon, it would have
been mentioned as well as (the other two particulars). <span
id="fr_6329"></span>[6330](#fn_6329.md) In conclusion, I will apply the
Gospel as a supplementary testimony to the Old Testament.  Now in this
there is all the greater reason why there should be shown the material
(if there were any) out of which God made all things, inasmuch as it is
therein plainly revealed by whom He made all things. “In the beginning
was the Word” <span id="fr_6330"></span>[6331](#fn_6330.md) —that is, the
same beginning, of course, in which God made the heaven and the
earth <span id="fr_6331"></span>[6332](#fn_6331.md) —“and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God.  All things were made by Him, and without Him
nothing was made.” <span id="fr_6332"></span>[6333](#fn_6332.md) Now, since
we have here clearly told us who the Maker was, that is, God, and what
He made, even all things, and through whom He made them, even His Word,
would not the order of the narrative have required that the source out
of which all things were made by God through the Word should likewise be
declared, if they had been in fact made out of anything? What,
therefore, did not exist, the Scripture was unable to mention; and by
not mentioning it, it has given us a clear proof that there was no such
thing: for if there had been, the Scripture would have mentioned it.
