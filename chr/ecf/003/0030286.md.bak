<span id="v.iii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Christ First Delivered the Faith.
The Apostles Spread It; They Founded Churches as the Depositories
Thereof. That Faith, Therefore, is Apostolic, Which Descended from the
Apostles, Through Apostolic Churches.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xx-p2"></span>Christ Jesus our Lord (may He bear with me
a moment in thus expressing myself!), whosoever He is, of what God
soever He is the Son, of what substance soever He is man and God, of
what faith soever He is the teacher, of what reward soever He is the
Promiser, did, whilst He lived on earth, Himself declare what He was,
what He had been, what the Father’s will was which He was administering,
what the duty of man was which He was prescribing; (and this declaration
He made,) either openly to the people, or privately to His disciples, of
whom He had chosen the twelve chief ones to be at His side, <span
id="fr_2050"></span>[2051](#fn_2050.md) and whom He destined to be the
teachers of the nations. Accordingly, after one of these had been struck
off, He commanded the eleven others, on His departure to the Father, to
“go and teach *all* nations, who were to be baptized into the Father,
and into the Son, and into the Holy Ghost.” <span
id="fr_2051"></span>[2052](#fn_2051.md) Immediately, therefore, so did the
apostles, whom this designation indicates as “*the sent*.” Having, on
the authority of a prophecy, which occurs in a psalm of David, <span
id="fr_2052"></span>[2053](#fn_2052.md) chosen Matthias by lot as the
twelfth, into the place of Judas, they obtained the promised power of
the Holy Ghost for the gift of miracles and of utterance; and after
first bearing witness to the faith in Jesus Christ throughout Judæa, and
founding churches (there), they next went forth into the world and
preached the same doctrine of the same faith to the nations. They then
in like manner founded churches in every city, from which all the other
churches, one after another, derived the tradition of the faith, <span
id="fr_2053"></span>[2054](#fn_2053.md) and the seeds of doctrine, and are
every day deriving them, <span id="fr_2054"></span>[2055](#fn_2054.md) that
they may become churches. Indeed, it is on this account only that they
will be able to deem themselves apostolic, as being the offspring of
apostolic churches.  Every sort of thing <span
id="fr_2055"></span>[2056](#fn_2055.md) must necessarily revert to its
original for its classification. <span
id="fr_2056"></span>[2057](#fn_2056.md) Therefore the churches, although
they are so many and so great, comprise but the one primitive church,
(founded) by the apostles, from which they all (spring).  In this way
all are primitive, and all are apostolic, whilst they are all proved to
be one, in (unbroken) unity, by their peaceful communion, <span
id="fr_2057"></span>[2058](#fn_2057.md) and title of brotherhood, and
bond <span id="fr_2058"></span>[2059](#fn_2058.md) of
hospitality,—privileges <span id="fr_2059"></span>[2060](#fn_2059.md) which
no other rule directs than the one tradition of the selfsame
mystery. <span id="fr_2060"></span>[2061](#fn_2060.md)
