<span id="v.ix.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Christ Not the Father, as
Praxeas Said. The Inconsistency of This Opinion, No Less Than Its
Absurdity, Exposed. The True Doctrine of Jesus Christ According to St.
Paul, Who Agrees with Other Sacred Writers.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xxviii-p2"></span>And so, most foolish heretic, you make
*Christ* to be the Father, without once considering the actual force of
this name, if indeed Christ is a name, and not rather a surname, or
designation; for it signifies “Anointed.” But Anointed is no more a
proper name than Clothed or Shod; it is only an accessory to a name.
Suppose now that by some means Jesus were also called Vestitus
(*Clothed*), as He is actually called Christ from the mystery of His
anointing, would you in like manner say that Jesus was the Son of God,
and at the same time suppose that *Vestitus* was the Father? Now then,
concerning Christ, if Christ is the Father, the Father is an Anointed
One, and receives the unction of course from another. Else if it is from
Himself that He re<span id="page_625">p. 625</span> <span
id="v.ix.xxviii-Page_625"></span>ceives it, then you must prove it to
us. But we learn no such fact from the Acts of the Apostles in that
ejaculation of the Church to God, “Of a truth, Lord, against Thy Holy
Child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with
the Gentiles *and the people of Israel* were gathered together.” <span
id="fr_8161"></span>[8162](#fn_8161.md) These then testified both that
Jesus was the Son of God, and that being the Son, He was anointed by the
Father. Christ therefore must be the same as Jesus who was anointed by
the Father, and not the Father, who anointed the Son. To the same effect
are the words of Peter: “Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that
God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and
Christ,” that is, *Anointed*. <span id="fr_8162"></span>[8163](#fn_8162.md)
John, moreover, brands that man as “a liar” who “denieth that Jesus is
the Christ;” whilst on the other hand he declares that “every one is
born of God who believeth that Jesus is the Christ.” <span
id="fr_8163"></span>[8164](#fn_8163.md) Wherefore he also exhorts us to
believe in the name of His (*the Father’s*,) Son Jesus Christ, that “our
fellowship may be with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_8164"></span>[8165](#fn_8164.md) Paul, in like manner, everywhere
speaks of “God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.”  When writing to
the Romans, he gives thanks to God through our Lord Jesus Christ. <span
id="fr_8165"></span>[8166](#fn_8165.md) To the Galatians he declares
himself to be “an apostle not of men, neither by man, but through Jesus
Christ and God the Father.” <span id="fr_8166"></span>[8167](#fn_8166.md)
You possess indeed all his writings, which testify plainly to the same
effect, and set forth Two—God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Son of the Father.  (They also testify) that Jesus is Himself the
Christ, and under one or the other designation the Son of God.  For
precisely by the same right as both names belong to the same Person,
even the Son of God, does either name alone without the other belong to
the same Person. Consequently, whether it be the name Jesus which occurs
alone, Christ is also understood, because Jesus is the Anointed One; or
if the name Christ is the only one given, then Jesus is identified with
Him, because the Anointed One is Jesus. Now, of these two names *Jesus
Christ*, the former is the proper one, which was given to Him by the
angel; and the latter is only an adjunct, predicable of Him from His
anointing,—thus suggesting the proviso that Christ must be the Son, not
the Father. How blind, to be sure, is the man who fails to perceive that
by the name of Christ some other God is implied, if he ascribes to the
Father this name of Christ! For if Christ is God the Father, when He
says, “I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your
God,” <span id="fr_8167"></span>[8168](#fn_8167.md) He of course shows
plainly enough that there is above Himself another Father and another
God. If, again, the Father is Christ, *He* must be some other Being who
“strengtheneth the thunder, and createth the wind, and declareth unto
men His Christ.” <span id="fr_8168"></span>[8169](#fn_8168.md) And if “the
kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together
against *the Lord and against* His Christ,” <span
id="fr_8169"></span>[8170](#fn_8169.md) that Lord must be another Being,
against whose Christ were gathered together the kings and the rulers.
And if, to quote another passage, “Thus saith the Lord to my Lord
Christ,” <span id="fr_8170"></span>[8171](#fn_8170.md) the Lord who speaks
to the Father of Christ must be a distinct Being. Moreover, when the
apostle in his epistle prays, “That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ may
give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of knowledge,” <span
id="fr_8171"></span>[8172](#fn_8171) He must be other (than Christ.md), who
is the God of Jesus Christ, the bestower of spiritual gifts. And once
for all, that we may not wander through every passage, He “who raised up
Christ from the dead, and is also to raise up our mortal bodies,” <span
id="fr_8172"></span>[8173](#fn_8172.md) must certainly be, as the
quickener, different from the dead Father, <span
id="fr_8173"></span>[8174](#fn_8173.md) or even from the quickened Father,
if Christ who died is the Father.
