<span id="iv.viii.ii.xiii"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII. <span
id="fr_1010"></span>[1011](#fn_1010.md) —The Gods Human at First. Who Had
the Authority to Make Them Divine? Jupiter Not Only Human, But
Immoral.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xiii-p3"></span>Manifest cases, indeed, like these
have a force peculiarly their own.  Men like Varro and his
fellow-dreamers admit into the ranks of the divinity those whom they
cannot assert to have been in their primitive condition anything but
men; (and this they do) by affirming that they became gods after their
death. Here, then, I take my stand. If your gods were elected <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[1012](#fn_1011.md) to this dignity and deity, <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[1013](#fn_1012.md) just as you recruit the ranks of
your senate, you cannot help conceding, in your wisdom, that there must
be some one supreme sovereign who has the power of selecting, and is a
kind of Cæsar; and nobody is able to confer <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[1014](#fn_1013.md) on others a thing over which he has
not absolute control. Besides, if they were able to make gods of
themselves after their death, pray tell me why they chose to be in an
inferior condition at first? Or, again, if there is no one who made them
gods, how can they be said to have been made such, if they could only
have been made by some one else? There is therefore no ground afforded
you for denying that there is a certain wholesale distributor <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[1015](#fn_1014.md) of divinity. Let us accordingly
examine the reasons for despatching mortal beings to heaven. I suppose
you will produce a pair of them. Whoever, then, is the awarder (of the
divine honours), exercises his function, either that he may have some
supports, or defences, or it may be even ornaments to his own dignity;
or from the pressing claims of the meritorious, that he may reward all
the deserving. No other cause is it permitted us to conjecture. Now
there is no one who, when bestowing a gift on another, does not act with
a view to his own interest or the other’s. This conduct, however, cannot
be worthy of the Divine Being, inasmuch as His power is so great that He
can make gods outright; whilst His bringing man into such request, on
the pretence that he requires the aid and support of certain, even dead
persons, is a strange conceit, since He was able from the very first to
create for Himself immortal beings. He who has compared human things
with divine will require no further arguments on these points. And yet
the latter opinion ought to be discussed, that God conferred divine
honours in consideration of meritorious claims. Well, then, if the award
was made on such grounds, if heaven was opened to men of the primitive
age because of their deserts, we must reflect that after that time no
one was worthy of such honour; except it be, that there is now no longer
such a place for any one to attain to. Let us grant that anciently men
may have deserved heaven by reason of their great merits. Then let us
consider whether there really was such merit. Let the man who alleges
that it did exist declare his own view of merit.  Since the actions of
men done in the very infancy of time <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[1016](#fn_1015.md) are a valid claim for their
deification, you consistently admitted to the honour the brother and
sister who were stained with the sin of incest—Ops and Saturn. Your
Jupiter too, stolen in his infancy, was unworthy of both the home and
the nutriment accorded to human beings; and, as he deserved for so bad a
child, he had to live in Crete. <span
id="fr_1016"></span>[1017](#fn_1016.md) Afterwards, when full-grown, he
dethrones his own father, who, whatever his parental character may have
been, was most prosperous in his reign, king as he was of the golden
age. Under him, a stranger to toil and want, <span id="page_143">p.
143</span> <span id="iv.viii.ii.xiii-Page_143"></span>peace maintained
its joyous and gentle sway; under him—

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xiii-p10"></span>“Nulli subigebant arva
coloni;” <span id="fr_1017"></span>[1018](#fn_1017.md)

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xiii-p12"></span>“No swains would bring the fields
beneath their sway;” <span id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018.md)

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xiii-p14"></span>and without the importunity of any
one the earth would bear all crops spontaneously. <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019.md) But he hated a father who had been
guilty of incest, and had once mutilated his <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020.md) grandfather. And yet, behold, he
himself marries his own sister; so that I should suppose the old adage
was made for him: <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xiii-p16.1"></span>Τοῦ πατρὸς τὸ παιδίον</span>—“Father’s
own child.” There was “not a pin to choose” between the father’s piety
and the son’s. If the laws had been just even at that early time, <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021.md) Jupiter ought to have been “sewed
up in both sacks.” <span id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022.md) After this
corroboration of his lust with incestuous gratification, why should he
hesitate to indulge himself lavishly in the lighter excesses of adultery
and debauchery? Ever since <span id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023.md)
poetry sported thus with his character, in some such way as is usual
when a runaway slave <span id="fr_1024"></span>[1025](#fn_1024.md) is
posted up in public, we have been in the habit of gossiping without
restraint <span id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025.md) of his tricks <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[1027](#fn_1026.md) in our chat with passers-by; <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[1028](#fn_1027.md) sometimes sketching him out in the
form of the very money which was the fee of his debauchery—as when (he
personated) a bull, or rather paid the money’s worth of one, <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028) and showered (gold.md) into the
maiden’s chamber, or rather forced his way in with a bribe; <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[1030](#fn_1029) sometimes (figuring him.md) in the
very likenesses of the parts which were acted <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[1031](#fn_1030.md) —as the eagle which ravished (the
beautiful youth), <span id="fr_1031"></span>[1032](#fn_1031.md) and the
swan which sang (the enchanting song). <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[1033](#fn_1032.md) Well now, are not such fables as
these made up of the most disgusting intrigues and the worst of
scandals? or would not the morals and tempers of men be likely to become
wanton from such examples? In what manner demons, the offspring of evil
angels who have been long engaged in their mission, have laboured to
turn men <span id="fr_1033"></span>[1034](#fn_1033.md) aside from the faith
to unbelief and to such fables, we must not in this place speak of to
any extent. As indeed the general body <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[1035](#fn_1034) (of your gods.md), which took their
cue <span id="fr_1035"></span>[1036](#fn_1035.md) from their kings, and
princes, and instructors, <span id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036.md) was
not of the self-same nature, it was in some other way <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037.md) that similarity of character was
exacted by their authority. But how much the worst of them was he who
(ought to have been, but) was not, the best of them? By a title peculiar
to him, you are indeed in the habit of calling Jupiter “the Best,” <span
id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md) whilst in Virgil he is “Æquus
Jupiter.” <span id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039.md) All therefore were
*like* him—incestuous towards their own kith and kin, unchaste to
strangers, impious, unjust! Now he whom mythic story left untainted with
no conspicuous infamy, was not worthy to be made a god.
