<span id="vi.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Answer to the Objection that “The
Lord Did Not Baptize.”</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi-p2"></span>“But behold, “say some, “the Lord came,
and baptized not; for we read, ‘And yet He used not to baptize, but His
disciples!’” <span id="fr_8653"></span>[8654](#fn_8653.md) As if, in truth,
John had preached that He would baptize with His own hands! Of course,
his words are not so to be understood, but as simply spoken after an
ordinary manner; just as, for instance, we say, “The emperor set forth
an edict,” or, “The prefect cudgelled him.”  Pray does the emperor in
person set forth, or the prefect in person cudgel? One whose ministers
do a thing is always said to do it. <span
id="fr_8654"></span>[8655](#fn_8654.md) So “He will baptize you” will have
to be understood as standing for, “Through Him,” or “Into Him,” “you
will be baptized.” But let not (the fact) that “He Himself baptized not”
trouble any.  For into whom should He baptize?  Into repentance? Of what
use, then, do you make His forerunner? Into remission of sins, which He
used to give by a word? Into Himself, whom by humility He was
concealing? Into the Holy Spirit, who had not yet descended from the
Father?  Into the Church, which His apostles had not yet founded? And
thus it was with the selfsame “baptism of John” that His disciples used
to baptize, as ministers, with which John before had baptized as
forerunner. Let none think it was with some other, because no other
exists, except that of Christ subsequently; which at that time, of
course, could not be given by His disciples, inasmuch as the glory of
the Lord had not yet been fully attained, <span
id="fr_8655"></span>[8656](#fn_8655.md) nor the efficacy of the font <span
id="fr_8656"></span>[8657](#fn_8656.md) established through the passion and
the resurrection; because neither can our death see dissolution except
by the Lord’s passion, nor our life be restored without His
resurrection.
