<p class="c19"><a name="v.iv.iii.viii-p2"></A>For it was not merely that he might live the natural life that God had produced man, but&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2808"></A><A HREF="#fn_2808"><FONT SIZE="1">2809</FONT></A>
 that he should live virtuously, that is, in relation to God and to His law. Accordingly, God gave him <i>to live</i> when he was formed into a living soul; but He charged him <i>to live virtuously</i> when he was required to obey a law. So also God shows that man was not constituted for death, by now wishing that he should be restored to life, preferring the sinner&#146;s repentance to his death.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2809"></A><A HREF="#fn_2809"><FONT SIZE="1">2810</FONT></A>
 As, therefore, God designed for man a condition of life, so man brought on himself a state of death; and this, too, neither through infirmity nor through ignorance, so that no blame can be imputed to the Creator. No doubt it was an angel who was the seducer; but then the victim of that seduction was free, and master of himself; <A NAME="page_304"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 304</FONT></A> <a name="v.iv.iii.viii-Page_304"></A>and as being the image and likeness of God, was stronger than any angel; and as being, too, the <i>afflatus</i> of the Divine Being, was nobler than that material spirit of which angels were made. <i>Who maketh</i>, says he, <i>His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2810"></A><A HREF="#fn_2810"><FONT SIZE="1">2811</FONT></A>
 He would not have made all things subject to man, if he had been too weak for the dominion, and inferior to the angels, to whom He assigned no such subjects; nor would He have put the burden of law upon him, if he had been incapable of sustaining so great a weight; nor, again, would He have threatened with the penalty of death a creature whom He knew to be guiltless on the score of his helplessness:&#160; in short, if He had made him infirm, it would not have been by liberty and independence of will, but rather by the withholding from him these endowments. And thus it comes to pass, that even now also, the same human being, the same substance of his soul, the same condition as Adam&#146;s, is made conqueror over the same devil by the self-same liberty and power of his will, when it moves in obedience to the laws of God.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2811"></A><A HREF="#fn_2811"><FONT SIZE="1">2812</FONT></A>
