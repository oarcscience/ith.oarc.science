<span id="iv.viii.ii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—A Disgraceful Feature of the
Roman Mythology. It Honours Such Infamous Characters as
Larentina.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.x-p2"></span>I hasten to even more abominable
cases. Your writers have not been ashamed to publish that of Larentina. 
She was a hired prostitute, whether as the nurse of Romulus, and
therefore called *Lupa*, because she was a prostitute, or as the
mistress of Hercules, now deceased, that is to say, now deified.
They <span id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944.md) relate that his
temple-warder <span id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945.md) happened to be
playing at dice in the temple alone; and in order to represent a partner
for himself in the game, in the absence of an actual one, he began to
play with one hand for Hercules and the other for himself. (The
condition was,) that if he won the stakes from Hercules, he should with
them procure a supper and a prostitute; if Hercules, however, proved the
winner, I mean his other hand, then he should provide the same for
Hercules. The hand of Hercules won. That achievement might well have
been added to his twelve labours!  The temple-warden buys a supper for
the hero, and hires Larentina to play the whore. The fire which
dissolved the <span id="page_139">p. 139</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.x-Page_139"></span>body of even a Hercules <span
id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946.md) enjoyed the supper, and the altar
consumed everything. Larentina sleeps alone in the temple; and *she* a
woman from the brothel, boasts that in her dreams she had submitted
herself to the pleasure of Hercules; <span
id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947.md) and she might possibly have
experienced this, as it passed through her mind, in her sleep. In the
morning, on going out of the temple very early, she is solicited by a
young man—“a third Hercules,” so to speak. <span
id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948.md) He invites her home. She complies,
remembering that Hercules had told her that it would be for her
advantage.  He then, to be sure, obtains permission that they should be
united in lawful wedlock (for none was allowed to have intercourse with
the concubine of a god without being punished for it); the husband makes
her his heir. By and by, just before her death, she bequeathed to the
Roman people the rather large estate which she had obtained through
Hercules. After this she sought deification for her daughters too, whom
indeed the divine Larentina ought to have appointed her heirs also. The
gods of the Romans received an accession in her dignity. For she alone
of all the wives of Hercules was dear to him, because she alone was
rich; and she was even far more fortunate than Ceres, who contributed to
the pleasure of the (king of the) dead. <span
id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949.md) After so many examples and *eminent*
names among you, who might not have been declared divine? Who, in fact,
ever raised a question as to his divinity against Antinous? <span
id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950.md) Was even Ganymede more grateful and
dear than he to (the supreme god) who loved him?  According to you,
heaven is open to the dead. You prepare <span
id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951.md) a way from Hades to the stars. 
Prostitutes mount it in all directions, so that you must not suppose
that you are conferring a great distinction upon your kings.
