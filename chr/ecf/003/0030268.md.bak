<span id="v.iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Analogy Between Fevers and
Heresies. Heresies Not to Be Wondered At: Their Strength Derived from
Weakness of Men’s Faith. They Have Not the Truth. Simile of Pugilists
and Gladiators in Illustration.</span>

<span id="v.iii.ii-p2"></span>Taking the similar case <span
id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md) of fever, which is appointed a
place amongst all other deadly and excruciating issues (of life) for
destroying man: we are not surprised either that it exists, for there it
is, or that it consumes man, for that is the purpose of its existence. 
In like manner, with respect to heresies, which are produced for the
weakening and the extinction of faith, since we feel a dread because
they have this power, we should first dread the fact of their existence;
for as long as they exist, they have their power; and as long as they
have their power, they have their existence. But still fever, as being
an evil both in its cause <span id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) and
in its power, as all know, we rather loathe than wonder at, and to the
best of our power guard against, not having its extirpation in our
power. Some men prefer wondering at heresies, however, which bring with
them eternal death and the heat of a stronger fire, for possessing this
power, instead of avoiding their power when they have the means of
escape: but heresies would have no power, if (men) would cease to wonder
that they have such power. For it either happens that, while men wonder,
they fall into a snare, or, because they are ensnared, they cherish
their surprise, as if heresies <span id="page_244">p. 244</span> <span
id="v.iii.ii-Page_244"></span>were so powerful because of some truth
which belonged to them. It would no doubt be a wonderful thing that evil
should have any force of its own, were it not that heresies are strong
in those persons who are not strong in faith. In a combat of boxers and
gladiators, generally speaking, it is not because a man is strong that
he gains the victory, or loses it because he is not strong, but because
he who is vanquished was a man of no strength; and indeed this very
conqueror, when afterwards matched against a really powerful man,
actually retires crest-fallen from the contest. In precisely the same
way, heresies derive such strength as they have from the infirmities of
individuals—having no strength whenever they encounter a really powerful
faith.
