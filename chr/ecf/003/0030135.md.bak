id="iv.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.</span>

<span id="iv.vii.iii-p2"></span>However, as we have already remarked, it
cannot but distress us that no state shall bear unpunished the guilt of
shedding Christian blood; as you see, indeed, in what took place during
the presidency of Hilarian, for when there had been some agitation about
places of sepulture for our dead, and the cry arose, “No *areæ*—no
burial-grounds for the Christians,” it came that their own *areæ*, <span
id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md) their threshing-floors, were
a-wanting, for they gathered in no harvests. As to the rains of the
bygone year, it is abundantly plain of what they were intended to remind
men—of the deluge, no doubt, which in ancient times overtook human
unbelief and wickedness; and as to the fires which lately hung all night
over the walls of Carthage, they who saw them know what they threatened;
and what the preceding thunders pealed, *they* who were hardened by them
can tell. All these things are signs of God’s impending wrath, which we
must needs publish and proclaim in every possible way; and in the
meanwhile we must pray it may be only local. Sure are *they* to
experience it one day in its universal and final form, who interpret
otherwise these samples of it. That sun, too, in the metropolis of
Utica, <span id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md) with light all but
extinguished, was a portent which could not have occurred from an
ordinary eclipse, situated as the lord of day was in his height and
house. You have the astrologers, consult them about it. We can point you
also to the deaths of some provincial rulers, who in their last hours
had painful memories of their sin in persecuting the followers of
Christ. <span id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) Vigellius Saturninus,
who first here used the sword against us, lost his eyesight.  Claudius
Lucius Herminianus in Cappadocia, enraged that his wife had become a
Christian, had treated the Christians with great cruelty: well, left
alone in his palace, suffering under a contagious malady, he boiled out
in living worms, and was heard exclaiming, “Let nobody know of it, lest
the Christians rejoice, and Christian wives take encouragement.”
Afterwards he came to see his error in having tempted so many from their
stedfastness by the tortures he inflicted, and died almost a Christian
himself. In that doom which overtook Byzantium, <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) Cæcilius Capella could not help crying
out, “Christians, rejoice!” Yes, and the persecutors who seem to
themselves to have acted with impunity shall not escape the day of
judgment. For you we sincerely wish it may prove to have been a warning
only, that, immediately after you had condemned Mavilus of Adrumetum to
the wild beasts, you were overtaken by those troubles, and that even now
for the same reason you are called to a blood-reckoning. But do not
forget the future.
