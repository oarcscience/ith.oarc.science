<p class="c19"><a name="v.x.xi-p2"></A>In the same manner, therefore, we maintain that the other announcements too refer to the condition of martyrdom. &#8220;He,&#8221; says Jesus, &#8220;who will value his own life also more than me, is not worthy of me,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8285"></A><A HREF="#fn_8285"><FONT SIZE="1">8286</FONT></A>
&#8212;that is, he who will rather live by denying, than die by confessing, me; and &#8220;he who findeth his life shall lose it; but he who loseth it for my sake shall find it.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8286"></A><A HREF="#fn_8286"><FONT SIZE="1">8287</FONT></A>
 Therefore indeed he finds it, who, in winning life, denies; but he who thinks that he wins it by denying, will lose it in hell. On the other hand, he who, through confessing, is killed, will lose it for the present, but is also about to find it unto everlasting life. In fine, governors themselves, when they urge men to deny, say, &#8220;Save your life;&#8221; and, &#8220;Do not lose your life.&#8221; How would Christ speak, but in accordance with the treatment to which the Christian would be subjected? But when He forbids thinking about what answer to make at a judgment-seat,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8287"></A><A HREF="#fn_8287"><FONT SIZE="1">8288</FONT></A>
 He is preparing His own servants <i>for what awaited them</i>, He gives the assurance that the Holy Spirit will answer <i>by them</i>; and when He wishes a brother to be visited in prison,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8288"></A><A HREF="#fn_8288"><FONT SIZE="1">8289</FONT></A>
 He is commanding that those about to confess be the object of solicitude; and He is soothing their <A NAME="page_645"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 645</FONT></A> <a name="v.x.xi-Page_645"></A>sufferings when He asserts that God will avenge His own elect.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8289"></A><A HREF="#fn_8289"><FONT SIZE="1">8290</FONT></A>
 In the parable also of the withering of the word&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8290"></A><A HREF="#fn_8290"><FONT SIZE="1">8291</FONT></A>
 after the green blade had sprung up, He is drawing a picture with reference to the burning heat of persecutions. If these announcements are not understood as they are made, without doubt they signify something else than the sound indicates; and there will be one thing in the words, another in their meanings, as is the case with allegories, with parables, with riddles. Whatever wind of reasoning, therefore, these scorpions may catch (in their sails), with whatever subtlety they may attack, there is now one line of defence:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8291"></A><A HREF="#fn_8291"><FONT SIZE="1">8292</FONT></A>
 an appeal will be made to the facts themselves, whether they occur as the Scriptures represent that they would; since another thing will then be meant in the Scriptures if that very one (which seems to be so) is not found in actual facts. For what is written, must needs come to pass. Besides, what is written will then come to pass, if something different does not.&#160; But, lo! we are both regarded as persons to be hated by all men for the sake of the name, as it is written; and are delivered up by our nearest of kin also, as it is written; and are brought before magistrates, and examined, and tortured, and make confession, and are ruthlessly killed, as it is written. So the Lord ordained. If He ordained these events otherwise, why do they not come to pass otherwise than He ordained them, that is, as He ordained them? And yet they do not come to pass otherwise than He ordained. Therefore, as they come to pass, so He ordained; and as He ordained, so they come to pass. For neither would they have been permitted to occur otherwise than He ordained, nor for His part would He have ordained otherwise than He would wish them to occur. Thus these passages of Scripture will not mean ought else than we recognise in actual facts; or if those events are not yet taking place which are announced, how are those taking place which have not been announced? For these events which are taking place have not been announced, if those which are announced are different, and not these which are taking place. Well now, seeing the very occurrences are met with in actual life which are believed to have been expressed with a different meaning in words, what would happen if they were found to have come to pass in a different manner <i>than had been revealed</i>? But this will be the waywardness of faith, not to believe what has been demonstrated, to assume the truth of what has not been demonstrated. And to this waywardness I will offer the following objection also, that if these events, which occur as is written, will not be the very ones which are announced, those too (which are meant) ought not to occur as is written, that they themselves also may not, after the example of these <i>others</i>, be in danger of exclusion, since there is one thing in the words and another in the facts; and there remains that even the events which have been announced are not seen when they occur, if they are announced otherwise than they have to occur. And how will those be believed (to have come to pass), which will not have been announced as they come to pass? Thus heretics, by not believing what is announced as it has been shown to have taken place, believe what has not been even announced.</p>
