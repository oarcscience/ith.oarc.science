<span id="vi.ii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Of Repentance, in the Case of
Such as Have Lapsed After Baptism.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p2"></span>So long, Lord Christ, may the blessing of
learning or hearing concerning the discipline of repentance be granted
to Thy servants, as is likewise behoves them, while *learners*, <span
id="fr_8479"></span>[8480](#fn_8479) not to sin; in other words, may
they thereafter know nothing of repentance, *and* require nothing of it.
It is irksome to append mention of a *second*—nay, in that case, the
*last*—hope; <span id="fr_8480"></span>[8481](#fn_8480) lest, by
treating of a remedial repenting yet in reserve, we seem to be pointing
to a yet further space for sinning.  Far be it that any one so interpret
our meaning, as if, because there is an opening for repenting, there
were even now, on that account, an opening for sinning; and *as if* the
redundance of celestial clemency constituted a licence for human
temerity. Let no one be less good because God is more so, by repeating
his sin as often as he is forgiven. Otherwise be sure he will find an
end of *escaping*, when he shall not find one of *sinning*.  We have
escaped *once*: thus far *and no farther* let us commit ourselves to
perils, even if we seem likely to escape a second time. <span
id="fr_8481"></span>[8482](#fn_8481) Men in general, after escaping
shipwreck, thenceforward declare divorce with ship and sea; and by
*cherishing* the memory of the danger, honour the benefit conferred by
God,—their deliverance, namely. I praise their fear, I love their
reverence; they are unwilling a second time to be a burden to the divine
mercy; they fear to seem to trample on *the benefit* which they have
attained; they shun, with a solicitude which at all events is good, to
make trial a second time of that which they have once learned to fear.
Thus the limit of their temerity is the evidence of their fear.

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p6"></span>Moreover, man’s fear <span
id="fr_8482"></span>[8483](#fn_8482) is an honour to God. But however,
that most stubborn foe (of ours) never gives his malice leisure; indeed,
he is then most savage when he fully feels that a man is freed *from his
clutches*; he then flames fiercest while he is fast becoming
extinguished. Grieve and groan he must of necessity over the fact that,
by the grant of pardon, so many works of death <span
id="fr_8483"></span>[8484](#fn_8483) in man have been overthrown, so
many marks of the condemnation which for<span id="page_663">p.
663</span> <span id="vi.ii.vii-Page_663"></span>merly was his own
erased. He grieves that that sinner, (now) Christ’s servant, is destined
to judge him and his angels. <span id="fr_8484"></span>[8485](#fn_8484)
And so he observes, assaults, besieges him, in the hope that he may be
able in some way either to strike his eyes with carnal concupiscence, or
else to entangle his mind with worldly enticements, or else to subvert
his faith by fear of earthly power, or else to wrest him from the sure
way by perverse traditions: he is never deficient in stumbling-blocks
nor in temptations. These poisons of his, therefore, God foreseeing,
although the gate of forgiveness has been shut and fastened up with the
bar of baptism, has permitted *it* still to stand somewhat open. <span
id="fr_8485"></span>[8486](#fn_8485) In the vestibule He has stationed
the second repentance for opening to such as knock:  but now *once for
all*, because now for the second time; <span
id="fr_8486"></span>[8487](#fn_8486) but never more because the last
time it had been in vain. For is not even this *once* enough? You have
what you now deserved not, for you had lost what you had received. If
the Lord’s indulgence grants you the means of restoring what you had
lost, be thankful for the benefit renewed, not to say amplified; for
*restoring* is a greater thing than *giving*, inasmuch as *having lost*
is more miserable than never having *received* at all. However, if any
do incur the debt of a second repentance, his spirit is not to be
forthwith cut down and undermined by despair. Let it by all means be
irksome to *sin* again, but let not to *repent* again be irksome:
irksome to imperil one’s self again, but not to be again set free. Let
none be ashamed. Repeated sickness must have repeated medicine. You will
show your gratitude to the Lord by not refusing what the Lord offers
you. You have offended, but can still be reconciled. You have One whom
you may satisfy, and Him willing. <span
