<span id="iv.vi.xvi-p4"></span>(Usages, p. 94*.)*

<span id="iv.vi.xvi-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.xvi-p5.1"></span>Here</span> a reference to Bunsen’s
Hippolytus, vol. III., so often referred to in the former volume, will
be useful. A slight *metaphrase* will bring out the sense, perhaps, of
this most interesting portrait of early Christian usages.

<span id="iv.vi.xvi-p6"></span>In baptism, we use trine immersion, in
honour of the trinal Name, after renouncing the devil and his angels and
the pomps and vanities of his kingdom. <span
id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) But this trinal rite is a ceremonial
amplification of what is actually commanded.  It was heretofore
tolerated in some places that communicants should take each one his
portion, with his own hand, but now we suffer none to receive this
sacrament except at the hand of the minister.  By our Lord’s own precept
and example, it may be received at the hour of ordinary meals, and alike
by all the faithful whether men or women, yet we usually do this in our
gatherings before daybreak. Offerings are made in honour of our departed
friends, on the anniversaries of their deaths, which we esteem their
true birthdays, as they are born to a better life.  We kneel at other
times, but on the Lord’s day, and from the Paschal Feast to Pentecost we
stand in prayer, nor do we count it lawful to fast on Sundays. We are
concerned if even a particle of the wine or bread, made ours, in the
Lord’s Supper, falls to the ground, by our carelessness. In all the
ordinary occasions of life we furrow our foreheads with the sign of the
Cross, in which we glory none the less because it is regarded as our
shame by the heathen in presence of whom it is a profession of our
faith.

<span id="iv.vi.xvi-p8"></span><span id="page_104">p. 104</span> <span
id="iv.vi.xvi-Page_104"></span>He owns there is no Scripture for any of
these usages, in which there was an *amplifying* of the precepts of
Christ. Let us note there was yet no *superstitious* usage even of this
sign of the Cross. It was an act by which, in suffering “shame for
Jesus’ name,” they fortified themselves against betraying the Master. It
took the place, be it remembered, of *innumerable* heathen practices,
and was a protest against them.  It meant—“God forbid that I should
glory, save in the Cross.” I express no personal opinion as to this
observance, but give the explanation which the early Christians would
have given. Tertullian touched with Montanism, but not yet withdrawn
from Catholic Communion, pleads the common cause of believers.

<span id="iv.vi.xvi-p9"></span><span class="c6"><span

<span id="iv.vi.xvi-p10"></span>(Traditions, cap. iv., p. 95.)

<span id="iv.vi.xvi-p11"></span>The traditions here argued for respect
things in their nature indifferent.  And as our author asserts the long
continuance of such usages to be their chief justification, it is
evident that he supposed them common from the Sub-apostolic age. There
is nothing here to justify *amplifications* and traditions which,
subsequently, came in like a flood to change principles of the Faith
once delivered to the Saints.  Even in his little plea for Montanistic
revelations of some possible novelties, he pre-supposes that *reason*
must be subject to Scripture and Apostolic Law.  In a word, his own
principle of “Prescription” must be honoured even in things indifferent;
if novel they are not Catholic.
