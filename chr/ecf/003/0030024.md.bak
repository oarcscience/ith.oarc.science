<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p2"></span>But, that we might attain an ampler
and more authoritative knowledge at once of Himself, and of His counsels
and will, God has added a written revelation for the behoof of every one
whose heart is set on seeking Him, that seeking he may find, and finding
believe, and believing obey. For from the first He sent messengers into
the world,—men whose stainless righteousness made them worthy to know
the Most High, and to reveal Him,—men abundantly endowed with the Holy
Spirit, that they might proclaim that there is one God only who made all
things, who formed man from the dust of the ground (for He is the true
Prometheus who gave order to the world by arranging the seasons and
their course),—these have further set before us the proofs He has given
of His majesty in His judgments by floods and fires, the rules appointed
by Him for securing His favour, as well as the retribution in store for
the ignoring, forsaking and keeping them, as being about at the end of
all to adjudge His worshippers to everlasting life, and the wicked to
the doom of fire at once without ending and without break, raising up
again all the dead from the beginning, reforming and renewing them with
the object of awarding either recompense. Once these things were with
us, too, the theme of ridicule. We are of your stock and nature: men are
made, not born, Christians. The preachers of whom we have spoken are
called prophets, from the office which belongs to them of predicting the
future. Their words, as well as the miracles which they performed, that
men might have faith in their divine authority, we have still in the
literary treasures they have left, and which are open to all. Ptolemy,
surnamed Philadelphus, the most learned of his race, a man of vast
acquaintance with all literature, emulating, I imagine, the book
enthusiasm of Pisistratus, among other remains of the past which either
their antiquity or something of peculiar interest made famous, at the
suggestion of Demetrius Phalereus, who was renowned above all
grammarians of his time, and to whom he had committed the management of
these things, applied to the Jews for their writings—I mean the writings
peculiar to them and in their tongue, which they alone possessed, for
from themselves, as a people dear to God for their fathers’ sake, their
prophets had ever sprung, and to them they had ever spoken. Now in
ancient times the people we call Jews bare the name of Hebrews, and so
both their writings and their speech were Hebrew. But that the
understanding of their books might not be wanting, this also the Jews
supplied to Ptolemy; for they gave him seventy-two interpreters—men whom
the philosopher Menedemus, the well-known asserter of a Providence,
regarded with respect as sharing in his views. The same account is given
by Aristæus. So the king left these works unlocked to all, in the Greek
language. <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) To this day, at the
temple of Serapis, the libraries of Ptolemy are to be seen, with the
identical Hebrew originals in them. The Jews, too, read them publicly.
Under a tribute-liberty, they are <span id="page_33">p. 33</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xviii-Page_33"></span>in the habit of going to hear them
every Sabbath. Whoever gives ear will find God in them; whoever takes
pains to understand, will be compelled to believe.
