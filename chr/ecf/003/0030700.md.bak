<span id="v.xi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.xi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Carpocrates, Cerinthus,
Ebion.</span>

<span id="v.xi.iii-p2"></span>Carpocrates, furthermore, introduced the
following sect. He affirms that there is one Virtue, the chief among the
upper (regions): that out of this were produced angels and Virtues,
which, being far distant from the upper Virtues, created this
world <span id="fr_8372"></span>[8373](#fn_8372.md) in the lower regions:
that Christ was not born of *the Virgin* Mary, but was generated—a mere
human being—of the seed of Joseph, superior (they admit) above all
others in the practice of righteousness and in integrity of life; that
He suffered among the Jews; and that His soul alone was received in
heaven as having been more firm and hardy than all others: whence he
would infer, retaining only the salvation of souls, that there are no
resurrections of the body.

<span id="v.xi.iii-p4"></span>After him brake out the heretic Cerinthus,
teaching similarly. For he, too, says that the world <span
id="fr_8373"></span>[8374](#fn_8373.md) was originated by those
*angels*; <span id="fr_8374"></span>[8375](#fn_8374.md) and sets forth
Christ as born of the seed of Joseph, contending that He was merely
human, without divinity; affirming also that the Law was given by
angels; <span id="fr_8375"></span>[8376](#fn_8375.md) representing the God
of the Jews as not the Lord, but an angel.

<span id="v.xi.iii-p8"></span>His successor was Ebion, <span
id="fr_8376"></span>[8377](#fn_8376.md) not agreeing with Cerinthus in
every point; in that he affirms the world <span
id="fr_8377"></span>[8378](#fn_8377.md) to have been made by God, not by
angels; and because it is written, “No disciple above *his* master, nor
servant above *his* lord,” <span id="fr_8378"></span>[8379](#fn_8378.md)
sets forth likewise the law <span id="page_652">p. 652</span> <span
id="v.xi.iii-Page_652"></span>*as binding*, <span
id="fr_8379"></span>[8380](#fn_8379.md) of course for the purpose of
excluding the gospel and vindicating Judaism.

<span id="v.xi.iii-p6"></span> “Ab illis” is perhaps an error for “ab
angelis,” by absorption of the first syllable. So Routh has conjectured
before me.

<span id="fn_8375"></span>[651:8376](0030700.htm#fr_8375.md) <span
id="v.xi.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="v.xi.iii-p7"></span> “*Ab* angelis:” an erroneous notion,
which professed probably to derive support from [John
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017.md), [Acts
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md), [Gal.
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md)<span id="v.xi.iii-p7.1"></span>,
where, however, the Greek prepositions should be carefully noted, and
ought in no case to be rendered by “ab.”

*Indiculus* (in Oehler) shows, “because in so far as, Christ observed
it.”
