id="iv.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.</span>

<span id="iv.v.xiii-p2"></span>We have, I think, faithfully carried out
our plan of showing in how many different ways the sin of idolatry
clings to the shows, in respect of their origins, their titles, their
equipments, their places of celebration, their arts; and we may hold it
as a thing beyond all doubt, that for us who have twice <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) renounced all idols, they are utterly
unsuitable. “Not that an idol is anything,” <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md) as the apostle says, but that the
homage they render is to demons, who are the real occupants of these
consecrated images, whether of dead men or (as they think) of gods. On
this account, therefore, because they have a common source—for their
dead and their deities are one—we abstain from both idolatries.  Nor do
we dislike the temples less than the monuments: we have nothing to do
with either altar, we adore neither image; we do not offer sacrifices to
the gods, and we make no funeral oblations to the departed; nay, we do
not partake of what is offered either in the one case or the other, for
we cannot partake of God’s feast and the feast of devils. <span
id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) If, then, we keep throat and belly
free from such defilements, how much more do we withhold our nobler
parts, our ears and eyes, from the idolatrous and funereal enjoyments,
which are not passed through the body, but are digested in the very
spirit and soul, whose purity, much more than that of our bodily organs,
God has a right to claim from us.
