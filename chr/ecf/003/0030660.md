<span id="v.ix.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—The Force of Sundry Passages of
Scripture Illustrated in Relation to the Plurality of Persons and Unity
of Substance. There is No Polytheism Here, Since the Unity is Insisted
on as a Remedy Against Polytheism.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xiii-p2"></span>Well then, you reply, if He was God who
spoke, and He was also God who created, at this rate, one God spoke and
another created; (and thus) two Gods are declared. If you are so
venturesome and harsh, reflect a while; and that you may think the
better and more deliberately, listen to the psalm in which Two are
described as God:  “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the sceptre
of Thy kingdom *is a sceptre of righteousness*. Thou hast loved
righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, even Thy God, hath
anointed Thee *or made Thee His Christ*.” <span
id="fr_7905"></span>[7906](#fn_7905) Now, since He here speaks to God,
and affirms that God is anointed by God, He must have affirmed that Two
are God, by reason of the sceptre’s royal power.  Accordingly, Isaiah
also says to the Person of Christ: “The Sabæans, men of stature, shall
pass over to Thee; and they shall follow after Thee, bound in fetters;
and they shall worship Thee, because God is in Thee:  for Thou art our
God, yet we knew it not; Thou art the God of Israel.” <span
id="fr_7906"></span>[7907](#fn_7906) For here too, by saying, “God is in
Thee,” and “Thou art God,” he sets forth Two who were God: (in the
former expression *in Thee*, he means) in Christ, and (in the other he
means) the Holy Ghost. That is a still grander statement which you will
find expressly made in the Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” <span
id="fr_7907"></span>[7908](#fn_7907) There was One “who was,” and there
was another “with whom” He was. But I find in Scripture the name <span
class="sc"><span id="v.ix.xiii-p5.2"></span>Lord</span> also applied to
them Both: “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right
hand.” <span id="fr_7908"></span>[7909](#fn_7908) And Isaiah says this:
“Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord
revealed?” <span id="fr_7909"></span>[7910](#fn_7909) Now he would <span
id="page_608">p. 608</span> <span id="v.ix.xiii-Page_608"></span>most
certainly have said *Thine Arm*, if he had not wished us to understand
that the Father is Lord, and the Son also is Lord. A much more ancient
testimony we have also in Genesis: “Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and
upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.” <span
id="fr_7910"></span>[7911](#fn_7910) Now, either deny that this is
Scripture; or else (let me ask) what sort of man you are, that you do
not think words ought to be taken and understood in the sense in which
they are written, especially when they are not expressed in allegories
and parables, but in determinate and simple declarations? If, indeed,
you follow those who did not at the time endure the Lord when showing
Himself to be the Son of God, because they would not believe Him to be
the Lord, then (I ask you) call to mind along with them the passage
where it is written, “I have said, Ye are gods, and ye are children of
the Most High;” <span id="fr_7911"></span>[7912](#fn_7911) and again,
“God standeth in the congregation of gods;” <span
id="fr_7912"></span>[7913](#fn_7912) in order that, if the Scripture has
not been afraid to designate as gods human beings, who have become sons
of God by faith, you may be sure that the same Scripture has with
greater propriety conferred the name of the Lord on the true and one
only Son of God. Very well! you say, I shall challenge you to preach
from this day forth (and that, too, on the authority of these same
Scriptures) two Gods and two Lords, consistently with your views. God
forbid, (is my reply). For we, who by the grace of God possess an
insight into both the times and the occasions of the Sacred Writings,
especially we who are followers of the Paraclete, not of human
*teachers*, do indeed definitively declare that *Two* Beings are God,
the Father and the Son, and, with the addition of the Holy Spirit, even
*Three*, according to the principle of the *divine* economy, which
introduces *number*, in order that the Father may not, as you perversely
infer, be Himself believed to have been born and to have suffered, which
it is not lawful to believe, forasmuch as it has not been so handed
down. That there are, however, two Gods or two Lords, is a statement
which at no time proceeds out of our mouth: not as if it were untrue
that the Father is God, and the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God,
and each is God; but because in earlier times Two were actually spoken
of as God, and two as Lord, that when Christ should come He might be
both acknowledged as God and designated as Lord, being the Son of Him
who is both God and Lord. Now, if there were found in the Scriptures but
one Personality of Him who is God and Lord, Christ would justly enough
be inadmissible to the title of God and Lord: for (in the Scriptures)
there was declared to be none other than One God and One Lord, and it
must have followed that the Father should Himself seem to have come down
(to earth), inasmuch as only One God and One Lord was ever read of (in
the Scriptures), and His entire *Economy* would be involved in
obscurity, which has been planned and arranged with so clear a foresight
*in His providential dispensation* as matter for our faith.  As soon,
however, as Christ came, and was recognised by us as the very Being who
had from the beginning <span id="fr_7913"></span>[7914](#fn_7913) caused
plurality <span id="fr_7914"></span>[7915](#fn_7914) (in the Divine
Economy), being the *second* from the Father, and with the Spirit the
*third*, and Himself declaring and manifesting the Father more fully
(than He had ever been before), the title of Him who is God and Lord was
at once restored to the Unity (of the Divine Nature), even because the
Gentiles would have to pass from the multitude of their idols to the One
Only God, in order that a difference might be distinctly settled between
the worshippers of One God and the votaries of polytheism. For it was
only right that Christians should shine in the world as “children of
light,” adoring and invoking Him who is the One God and Lord as “the
light of the world.” Besides, if, from that perfect knowledge <span
id="fr_7915"></span>[7916](#fn_7915) which assures us that the title of
God and Lord is suitable both to the Father, and to the Son, and to the
Holy Ghost, we were to invoke *a plurality of* gods and lords, we should
quench our torches, and we should become less courageous to endure the
martyr’s sufferings, from which an easy escape would everywhere lie open
to us, as soon as we swore by *a plurality of* gods and lords, as sundry
heretics do, who hold more gods than One.  I will therefore not speak of
gods at all, nor of lords, but I shall follow the apostle; so that if
the Father and the Son, are alike to be invoked, I shall call the Father
“*God*,” and invoke Jesus Christ as “*Lord*.” <span
id="fr_7916"></span>[7917](#fn_7916) But when Christ alone (is
mentioned), I shall be able to call Him “*God*,” as the same apostle
says: “Of whom is Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever.” <span
id="fr_7917"></span>[7918](#fn_7917) For I should give the name of
“*sun*” even to a sunbeam, considered in itself; but if I were
mentioning the sun from which the ray emanates, I certainly should at
once withdraw the name of sun from the mere beam. For although I make
not two suns, still I shall reckon both the sun and <span
id="page_609">p. 609</span> <span id="v.ix.xiii-Page_609"></span>its ray
to be as much two things and two forms <span
id="fr_7918"></span>[7919](#fn_7918) of one undivided substance, as God
and His Word, as the Father and the Son.
