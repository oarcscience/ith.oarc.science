<span id="v.xi.i-p6"></span> ————————————

<span id="v.xi.i-p7"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.xi.i-p7.1"></span>Chapter I.—Earliest Heretics: <span
id="fr_8330"></span>[8331](#fn_8330.md) Simon Magus, Menander, Saturninus,
Basilides, Nicolaus. \[The Work Begins as a Fragment.\]</span>

<span id="v.xi.i-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.xi.i-p9.1"></span>Of</span> which heretics I will (to pass by a
good deal) summarize some few particulars. For of Judaism’s heretics I
am silent—Dositheus the Samaritan, I mean, who was the first who had the
hardihood to repudiate the prophets, on the ground that they had not
spoken under inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Of the Sadducees I am
silent, who, springing from the root of this error, had the hardihood to
adjoin to this heresy the denial likewise of the resurrection of the
flesh. <span id="fr_8331"></span>[8332](#fn_8331.md) The Pharisees I
pretermit, who were “divided” from the Jews by their superimposing of
certain additaments to the law, which fact likewise made them worthy of
receiving this very name; <span id="fr_8332"></span>[8333](#fn_8332.md)
and, together with them, the Herodians likewise, who said that Herod was
Christ. To those I betake myself who have chosen to make the gospel the
starting-point of their heresies.

<span id="v.xi.i-p12"></span>Of these the first of all is Simon Magus,
who in the Acts of the Apostles earned a condign and just sentence from
the Apostle Peter. <span id="fr_8333"></span>[8334](#fn_8333.md) He had the
hardihood to call himself the Supreme Virtue, <span
id="fr_8334"></span>[8335](#fn_8334.md) that is, the Supreme God; and
moreover, (to assert) that the universe <span
id="fr_8335"></span>[8336](#fn_8335.md) had been originated by his angels;
that he had descended in quest of an erring dæmon, <span
id="fr_8336"></span>[8337](#fn_8336.md) which was Wisdom; that, in a
phantasmal semblance of God, he had *not* suffered among the Jews, but
was *as if he had suffered*. <span id="fr_8337"></span>[8338](#fn_8337.md)

<span id="v.xi.i-p18"></span>After him Menander, his disciple (likewise
a magician <span id="fr_8338"></span>[8339](#fn_8338) .md), saying the same
as Simon. Whatever Simon had affirmed himself to be, this did Menander
equally affirm himself to be, asserting that none could possibly have
salvation without being baptized in his name.

<span id="v.xi.i-p20"></span>Afterwards, again, followed Saturninus: he,
too, affirming that the innascible <span
id="fr_8339"></span>[8340](#fn_8339.md) Virtue, that is God, abides in the
highest regions, and that those regions are infinite, and in the regions
immediately above us; but that angels far removed from Him made the
lower world; <span id="fr_8340"></span>[8341](#fn_8340.md) and that,
because light from above had flashed refulgently in the lower regions,
the angels had carefully tried to form man after the similitude of that
light; that man lay crawling on the surface of the earth; that this
light and this higher virtue was, thanks to mercy, the salvable spark in
man, while all the rest of him perishes; <span
id="fr_8341"></span>[8342](#fn_8341.md) that Christ had not existed in a
bodily substance, and had endured a *quasi*-passion in a phantasmal
shape merely; that a resurrection of the flesh there will by no means
be.

<span id="v.xi.i-p24"></span>Afterwards broke out the heretic Basilides.
He affirms that there is a supreme Deity, by name Abraxas, <span
id="fr_8342"></span>[8343](#fn_8342.md) by whom was created Mind, which in
Greek he calls <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xi.i-p25.1"></span>Νοῦς</span>; that thence sprang the Word; that
of Him issued Providence, Virtue, <span
id="fr_8343"></span>[8344](#fn_8343.md) and Wisdom; that out of <span
id="page_650">p. 650</span> <span id="v.xi.i-Page_650"></span>these
subsequently were made Principalities, powers, <span
id="fr_8344"></span>[8345](#fn_8344.md) and Angels; that there ensued
infinite issues and processions of angels; that by these angels 365
heavens were formed, and the world, <span
id="fr_8345"></span>[8346](#fn_8345.md) in honour of Abraxas, whose name,
if computed, has in itself this number. Now, among the last of the
angels, those who made this world, <span
id="fr_8346"></span>[8347](#fn_8346.md) he places the God of the Jews
latest, that is, the God of the Law and of the Prophets, whom he denies
to be a God, but affirms to be an angel. To him, he says, was allotted
the seed of Abraham, and accordingly he it was who transferred the sons
of Israel from the land of Egypt into the land of Canaan; affirming him
to be turbulent above the other angels, and accordingly given to the
frequent arousing of seditions and wars, yes, and the shedding of human
blood.  Christ, moreover, he affirms to have been sent, not by this
maker of the world, <span id="fr_8347"></span>[8348](#fn_8347.md) but by
the above-named Abraxas; and to have come in a phantasm, and been
destitute of the substance of flesh:  that it was not He who suffered
among the Jews, but that Simon <span
id="fr_8348"></span>[8349](#fn_8348.md) was crucified in His stead: whence,
again, there must be no believing on him who was crucified, lest one
confess to having believed on Simon. Martyrdoms, he says, are not to be
endured. The resurrection of the flesh he strenuously impugns, affirming
that salvation has not been promised to *bodies*.

<span id="v.xi.i-p32"></span>A brother heretic <span
id="fr_8349"></span>[8350](#fn_8349.md) emerged in Nicolaus. He was one of
the seven deacons who were appointed in the Acts of the Apostles. <span
id="fr_8350"></span>[8351](#fn_8350.md) He affirms that Darkness was seized
with a concupiscence—and, indeed, a foul and obscene one—after Light:
out of this permixture it is a shame to say what fetid and unclean
(combinations arose).  The rest (of his tenets), too, are obscene. For
he tells of certain Æons, sons of turpitude, and of conjunctions of
execrable and obscene embraces and permixtures, <span
id="fr_8351"></span>[8352](#fn_8351.md) and certain yet baser outcomes of
these.  He teaches that there were born, moreover, dæmons, and gods, and
spirits seven, and other things sufficiently sacrilegious. alike and
foul, which we blush to recount, and at once pass them by.  Enough it is
for us that this heresy of the Nicolaitans has been condemned by the
Apocalypse of the Lord with the weightiest authority attaching to a
sentence, in saying “Because this thou holdest, thou hatest the doctrine
of the Nicolaitans, which I too hate.” <span
