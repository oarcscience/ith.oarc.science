<span id="v.iv.v.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Sermon on the Mount Continued.
Its Woes in Strict Agreement with the Creator’s Disposition.  Many
Quotations Out of the Old Testament in Proof of This.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xv-p2"></span>“In the like manner,” says He, <span
id="fr_3981"></span>[3982](#fn_3981.md) “did their fathers unto the
prophets.”  What a turncoat <span id="fr_3982"></span>[3983](#fn_3982.md)
is *Marcion’s* Christ! Now the destroyer, now the advocate of the
prophets! He destroyed them as their rival, by converting their
disciples; he took up their cause as their friend, by stigmatizing <span
id="fr_3983"></span>[3984](#fn_3983.md) their persecutors. But, <span
id="fr_3984"></span>[3985](#fn_3984.md) in *as* far as the defence of the
prophets could not be consistent in the Christ of Marcion, who came to
destroy them; in *so* far is it becoming to the Creator’s Christ that He
should stigmatize those who persecuted the prophets, for He in all
things accomplished their predictions. Again, it is more characteristic
of the Creator to upbraid sons with their fathers’ sins, than it is of
that god who chastizes no man for even his own misdeeds.  But you will
say, He cannot be regarded as defending the prophets simply because He
wished to affirm the iniquity of the Jews for their impious dealings
with their own prophets. Well, then, in this case, <span
id="fr_3985"></span>[3986](#fn_3985.md) no sin ought to have been charged
against the Jews: they were rather deserving of praise and approbation
when they maltreated <span id="fr_3986"></span>[3987](#fn_3986.md) those
whom <span id="page_368">p. 368</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xv-Page_368"></span>the absolutely good god *of Marcion*,
after so long a time, bestirred himself <span
id="fr_3987"></span>[3988](#fn_3987.md) to destroy. I suppose, however,
that by this time he had ceased to be the absolutely good god; <span
id="fr_3988"></span>[3989](#fn_3988.md) he had now sojourned a considerable
while even with the Creator, and was no longer (like) the god of
Epicurus <span id="fr_3989"></span>[3990](#fn_3989.md) purely and simply.
For see how he condescends <span id="fr_3990"></span>[3991](#fn_3990.md) to
curse, and proves himself capable of taking offence and feeling anger!
He actually pronounces a *woe*! But a doubt is raised against us as to
the import of this word, as if it carried with it less the sense of a
curse than of an admonition. Where, however, is the difference, since
even an admonition is not given without the sting of a threat,
especially when it is embittered with a *woe*? Moreover, both admonition
and threatening will be the resources of him <span
id="fr_3991"></span>[3992](#fn_3991.md) who knows how to feel angry. For no
one will forbid the doing of a thing with an admonition or a threat,
except him who will inflict punishment for the doing of it.  No one
would inflict punishment, except him who was susceptible of anger.
Others, again, admit that the word implies a curse; but they will have
it that Christ pronounced the woe, not as if it were His own genuine
feeling, but because the woe is from the Creator, and He wanted to set
forth to them the severity of the Creator in order that He might the
more commend His own long-suffering <span
id="fr_3992"></span>[3993](#fn_3992.md) in His beatitudes. Just as if it
were not competent to the Creator, in the pre-eminence of both His
attributes as the good God and Judge, that, as He had made
clemency <span id="fr_3993"></span>[3994](#fn_3993.md) the preamble of His
benediction so He should place severity in the sequel of His curses;
thus fully developing His discipline in both directions, both in
following out the blessing and in providing against the curse. <span
id="fr_3994"></span>[3995](#fn_3994.md) He had already said of old,
“Behold, I have set before you blessing and cursing.” <span
id="fr_3995"></span>[3996](#fn_3995.md) Which statement was really a
presage of <span id="fr_3996"></span>[3997](#fn_3996.md) this temper of the
gospel. Besides, what sort of being is that who, to insinuate a belief
in his own goodness, invidiously contrasted <span
id="fr_3997"></span>[3998](#fn_3997.md) with it the Creator’s severity? Of
little worth is the recommendation which has for its prop the defamation
of another. And yet by thus setting forth the severity of the Creator,
he, in fact, affirmed Him to be an object of fear. <span
id="fr_3998"></span>[3999](#fn_3998.md) Now if He be an object of fear, He
is of course more worthy of being obeyed than slighted; and thus
Marcion’s Christ begins to teach favourably to the Creator’s
interests. <span id="fr_3999"></span>[4000](#fn_3999.md) Then, *on the
admission above mentioned*, since the woe which has regard to the rich
is the Creator’s, it follows that it is not Christ, but the Creator, who
is angry with the rich; while Christ approves of <span
id="fr_4000"></span>[4001](#fn_4000.md) the incentives of the rich <span
id="fr_4001"></span>[4002](#fn_4001.md) —I mean, their pride, their
pomp, <span id="fr_4002"></span>[4003](#fn_4002.md) their love of the
world, and their contempt of God, owing to which they deserve the woe of
the Creator. But how happens it that the reprobation of the rich does
not proceed from the same *God* who had just before expressed
approbation of the poor? There is nobody but reprobates the opposite of
that which he has approved. If, therefore, there be imputed to the
Creator the woe pronounced against the rich, there must be claimed for
Him also the promise of the blessing upon the poor; and thus the entire
work of the Creator devolves on Christ.—If to Marcion’s god there be
ascribed the blessing of the poor, he must also have imputed to him the
malediction of the rich; and thus will he become the Creator’s
equal, <span id="fr_4003"></span>[4004](#fn_4003.md) both good and
judicial; nor will there be left any room for that distinction whereby
two gods are made; and when this distinction is removed, there will
remain the verity which pronounces the Creator to be the one only God.
Since, therefore, “*woe*” is a word indicative of malediction, or of
some unusually austere <span id="fr_4004"></span>[4005](#fn_4004.md)
exclamation; and since it is by Christ uttered against the rich, I shall
have to show that the Creator is also a despiser <span
id="fr_4005"></span>[4006](#fn_4005.md) of the rich, as I have shown Him to
be the defender <span id="fr_4006"></span>[4007](#fn_4006.md) of the poor,
in order that I may prove Christ to be on the Creator’s side in this
matter, even when He enriched Solomon. <span
id="fr_4007"></span>[4008](#fn_4007.md) But *with respect to this man*,
since, when a choice was left to him, he preferred asking for what he
knew to be well-pleasing to God—even wisdom—he further merited the
attainment of the riches, which he did not prefer. The endowing of a man
indeed with riches, is not an incongruity to God, for by the help of
riches even rich men are comforted and assisted; moreover, by them many
a work of justice and charity is carried out. But yet there are serious
faults <span id="fr_4008"></span>[4009](#fn_4008.md) which accompany
riches; and it is because of these that woes are denounced on the rich,
even in the Gospel. “Ye have received,” says He, “your
consolation;” <span id="fr_4009"></span>[4010](#fn_4009.md) that is, of
course, from <span id="page_369">p. 369</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xv-Page_369"></span>their riches, in the pomps and vanities
of the world which these purchase for them.  Accordingly, in
Deuteronomy, Moses says:  “Lest, when thou hast eaten and art full, and
hast built goodly houses, and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, as
well as thy silver and thy gold, thine heart be then lifted up, and thou
forget the Lord thy God.” <span id="fr_4010"></span>[4011](#fn_4010.md) In
similar terms, when king Hezekiah became proud of his treasures, and
gloried in them rather than in God before those who had come on an
embassy from Babylon, <span id="fr_4011"></span>[4012](#fn_4011.md) (the
Creator) breaks forth <span id="fr_4012"></span>[4013](#fn_4012.md) against
him by the mouth of Isaiah:  “Behold, the days come when all that is in
thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store, shall be
carried to Babylon.” <span id="fr_4013"></span>[4014](#fn_4013.md) So by
Jeremiah likewise did He say: “Let not the rich man glory in his riches
but let him that glorieth even glory in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_4014"></span>[4015](#fn_4014.md) Similarly against the daughters of
Sion does He inveigh by Isaiah, when they were haughty through their
pomp and the abundance of their riches, <span
id="fr_4015"></span>[4016](#fn_4015.md) just as in another passage He
utters His threats against the proud and noble: “Hell hath enlarged
herself, and opened her mouth, and down to it shall descend the
illustrious, and the great, and the rich (this shall be Christ’s ‘woe to
the rich’); and man <span id="fr_4016"></span>[4017](#fn_4016.md) shall be
humbled,” even he that exalts himself with riches; “and the mighty
man <span id="fr_4017"></span>[4018](#fn_4017.md) shall be dishonoured,”
even he who is mighty from his wealth. <span
id="fr_4018"></span>[4019](#fn_4018.md) Concerning whom He says again:
“Behold, the Lord of hosts shall confound the pompous together with
their strength:  those that are lifted up shall be hewn down, and such
as are lofty shall fall by the sword.” <span
id="fr_4019"></span>[4020](#fn_4019.md) And who are these but the rich?
Because they have indeed received their consolation, glory, and honour
and a lofty position from their wealth. In [Psalm
xlviii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#000.md)<span
id="v.iv.v.xv-p41.2"></span> He also turns off our care from these and
says: “Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, and when his glory is
increased: for when he shall die, he shall carry nothing away; nor shall
his glory descend along with him.” <span
id="fr_4020"></span>[4021](#fn_4020.md) So also in [Psalm
lxi.](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#000.md)<span
id="v.iv.v.xv-p42.2"></span>: “Do not desire riches; and if they do
yield you their lustre, <span id="fr_4021"></span>[4022](#fn_4021.md) do
not set your heart upon them.” <span
id="fr_4022"></span>[4023](#fn_4022.md) Lastly, this very same *woe* is
pronounced of old by Amos against the rich, who also abounded in
delights. “Woe unto them,” says he, “who sleep upon beds of ivory, and
deliciously stretch themselves upon their couches; who eat the kids from
the flocks of the goats, and sucking calves from the flocks of the
heifers, while they chant to the sound of the viol; as if they thought
they should continue long, and were not fleeting; who drink their
refined wines, and anoint themselves with the costliest
ointments.” <span id="fr_4023"></span>[4024](#fn_4023.md) Therefore, even
if I could do nothing else than show that the Creator dissuades men from
riches, without at the same time first condemning the rich, in the very
same terms in which Christ also did, no one could doubt that, from the
same authority, there was added a commination against the rich in that
woe of Christ, from whom also had first proceeded the dissuasion against
the material sin of these persons, that is, their riches. For such
commination is the necessary sequel to such a dissuasive.  He inflicts a
woe also on “the full, because they shall hunger; on those too which
laugh now, because they shall mourn.” <span
id="fr_4024"></span>[4025](#fn_4024.md) To these will correspond these
opposites which occur, as we have seen above, in the benedictions of the
Creator: “Behold, my servants shall be full, but ye shall be
hungry”—even because ye have been filled; “behold, my servants shall
rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed” <span
id="fr_4025"></span>[4026](#fn_4025.md) —even ye who shall mourn, who now
are laughing.  For as it is written in the psalm, “They who sow in tears
shall reap in joy,” <span id="fr_4026"></span>[4027](#fn_4026.md) so does
it run in the Gospel: They who sow in laughter, that is, in joy, shall
reap in tears. These principles did the Creator lay down of old; and
Christ has renewed them, by simply bringing them into prominent
view, <span id="fr_4027"></span>[4028](#fn_4027.md) not by making any
change in them. “Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for
so did their fathers to the false prophets.” <span
id="fr_4028"></span>[4029](#fn_4028.md) With equal stress does the Creator,
by His prophet Isaiah, censure those who seek after human flattery and
praise: “O my people, they who call you happy mislead you, and disturb
the paths of your feet.” <span id="fr_4029"></span>[4030](#fn_4029.md) In
another passage He forbids all implicit trust in man, and likewise in
the applause of man; as by the prophet Jeremiah: “Cursed be the man that
trusteth in man.” <span id="fr_4030"></span>[4031](#fn_4030.md) Whereas in
[Psalm cxvii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#000.md)<span
id="v.iv.v.xv-p52.2"></span> it is said: “It is better to trust in the
Lord than to put confidence in man; it is better to trust in the Lord
than to place hope in princes.” <span
id="fr_4031"></span>[4032](#fn_4031.md) Thus everything which is caught at
by men is adjured by the Creator, down to their good <span
id="page_370">p. 370</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xv-Page_370"></span>words. <span
id="fr_4032"></span>[4033](#fn_4032.md) It is as much His property to
condemn the praise and flattering words bestowed on the false prophets
by their fathers, as to condemn their vexatious and persecuting
treatment of the (true) prophets. As the injuries suffered by the
prophets could not be imputed <span id="fr_4033"></span>[4034](#fn_4033.md)
to their own God, so the applause bestowed on the false prophets could
not have been displeasing to any other god but the God of the *true*
prophets.
