<span id="iv.viii.i.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII. <span
id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584.md) —The Calumny Against the Christians
Illustrated in the Discovery of Psammetichus. Refutation of the
Story.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.viii-p3"></span>We are indeed said to be the “third
race” of men. What, a dog-faced race? <span
id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585.md) Or broadly shadow-footed? <span
id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586.md) Or some subterranean <span
id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587.md) Antipodes? If you attach any meaning
to these names, pray tell us what are the first and the second race,
that so we may know something of this “third.”  Psammetichus thought
that he had hit upon the ingenious discovery of the primeval man. He is
said to have removed certain new-born infants from all human
intercourse, and to have entrusted them to a nurse, whom he had
previously deprived of her tongue, in order that, being completely
exiled from all sound of the human voice, they might form their speech
without hearing it; and thus, deriving it from themselves alone, might
indicate what that first nation was whose speech was dictated by nature.
Their first utterance was <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.viii.i.viii-p6.1"></span>Bekkos</span>, a word which means
“*bread*” in the language of Phrygia: the Phrygians, therefore, are
supposed to be the first of the human race. <span
id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588.md) But it will not be out of place if we
make one observation, with a view to show how your faith abandons itself
more to vanities than to verities. <span id="page_117">p. 117</span>
<span id="iv.viii.i.viii-Page_117"></span>Can it be, then, at all
credible that the nurse retained her life, after the loss of so
important a member, the very organ of the breath of life, <span
id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589.md) —cut out, too, from the very root,
with her throat <span id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590.md) mutilated, which
cannot be wounded even on the outside without danger, and the putrid
gore flowing back to the chest, and deprived for so long a time of her
food? Come, even suppose that by the remedies of a Philomela she
retained her life, in the way supposed by wisest persons, who account
for the dumbness not by cutting out the tongue, but from the blush of
shame; if on such a supposition she lived, she would still be able to
blurt out some dull sound. And a shrill inarticulate noise from opening
the mouth only, without any modulation of the lips, might be forced from
the mere throat, though there were no tongue to help. This, it is
probable, the infants readily imitated, and the more so because it was
the only sound; only they did it a little more neatly, as they had
tongues; <span id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591.md) and then they attached
to it a definite signification. Granted, then, that the Phrygians were
the earliest race, it does not follow that the Christians are the third.
For how many other nations come regularly after the Phrygians? Take
care, however, lest those whom you call the third race should obtain the
first rank, since there is no nation indeed which is not Christian.
Whatever nation, therefore, was the first, is nevertheless Christian
now. <span id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592.md) It is ridiculous folly
which makes you say we are the latest race, and then specifically call
us the third. But it is in respect of our religion, <span
id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593.md) not of our nation, that we are
supposed to be the third; the series being the Romans, the Jews, and the
Christians after them. Where, then, are the Greeks? or if they are
reckoned amongst the Romans in regard to their superstition (since it
was from Greece that Rome borrowed even her gods), where at least are
the Egyptians, since these have, so far as I know, a mysterious religion
peculiar to themselves? Now, if they who belong to the third race are so
monstrous, what must they be supposed to be who preceded them in the
first and the second place?
