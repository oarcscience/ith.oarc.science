<span id="vi.vii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Duty of Imitating Our Master
Taught Us by Slaves. Even by Beasts. Obedient Imitation is Founded on
Patience.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.iv-p2"></span>Therefore, if we see all servants of
probity and right feeling shaping their conduct suitably to the
disposition of their lord; if, that is, the art of deserving favour is
obedience, <span id="fr_9030"></span>[9031](#fn_9030.md) while the rule of
obedience is a compliant subjection: how much more does it behove *us*
to be found with a character in accordance with our Lord,—servants as we
are of the <span id="page_709">p. 709</span> <span
id="vi.vii.iv-Page_709"></span>living God, whose judgment on His
servants turns not on a fetter or a cap of freedom, but on an eternity
either of penalty or of salvation; for the shunning of which severity or
the courting of which liberality there needs a diligence in
obedience <span id="fr_9031"></span>[9032](#fn_9031.md) as great as are the
comminations themselves which the severity utters, or the promises which
the liberality freely makes. <span id="fr_9032"></span>[9033](#fn_9032.md)
And yet we exact obedience <span id="fr_9033"></span>[9034](#fn_9033.md)
not from *men* only, who have the bond of their slavery under their
chin, <span id="fr_9034"></span>[9035](#fn_9034.md) or in any other legal
way are debtors to obedience, <span id="fr_9035"></span>[9036](#fn_9035.md)
but even from cattle, <span id="fr_9036"></span>[9037](#fn_9036.md) even
from brutes; <span id="fr_9037"></span>[9038](#fn_9037.md) understanding
that they have been provided and delivered for our uses by the Lord.
Shall, then, *creatures* which God makes subject to us be better than we
in the discipline of obedience? <span
id="fr_9038"></span>[9039](#fn_9038) Finally, (the creatures.md) which
obey, acknowledge *their masters*. Do we hesitate to listen diligently
to Him to whom alone we are subjected—that is, the Lord?  But how unjust
is it, how ungrateful likewise, not to repay from yourself the same
which, through the indulgence of your neighbour, you obtain from others,
to him through whom you obtain it!  Nor needs there more words on the
exhibition of obedience <span id="fr_9039"></span>[9040](#fn_9039.md) due
from us to the Lord God; for the acknowledgment <span
id="fr_9040"></span>[9041](#fn_9040.md) of God understands what is
incumbent on it.  Lest, however, we seem to have inserted *remarks* on
obedience <span id="fr_9041"></span>[9042](#fn_9041.md) as something
irrelevant, (let us remember) that obedience <span
id="fr_9042"></span>[9043](#fn_9042.md) itself is drawn from patience.
Never does an *im*patient *man* render it, or a *patient* fail to find
pleasure <span id="fr_9043"></span>[9044](#fn_9043.md) in it. Who, then,
could treat largely (enough) of the good of that *patience* which the
Lord God, the Demonstrator and Acceptor of all good things, carried
about in His own self? <span id="fr_9044"></span>[9045](#fn_9044.md) To
whom, again, would it be doubtful that every good thing ought, because
it pertains <span id="fr_9045"></span>[9046](#fn_9045.md) to God, to be
earnestly pursued with the whole mind by such as pertain to God? By
means of which (considerations) both commendation and exhortation <span
id="fr_9046"></span>[9047](#fn_9046.md) on the subject of patience are
briefly, and as it were in the compendium of a prescriptive rule,
established. <span id="fr_9047"></span>[9048](#fn_9047.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9030"></span>[708:9031](0030795.htm#fr_9030.md) <span
id="vi.vii.iv-p2.2"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.iv-p3"></span> “Obsequium,” distinguished by Döderlein
from “obedientia,” as a more voluntary and spontaneous thing, founded
less on authority than respect and love.

<span id="fn_9031"></span>[709:9032](0030795.htm#fr_9031.md) <span
id="vi.vii.iv-p3.2"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.iv-p4"></span> Obsequii.

<span id="fn_9032"></span>[709:9033](0030795.htm#fr_9032.md) <span
id="vi.vii.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.iv-p5"></span> “Pollicetur,” not “promittit.”

<span id="fn_9033"></span>[709:9034](0030795.htm#fr_9033.md) <span

id="vi.vii.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.iv-p7"></span> “Subnixis.” Perhaps this may be the
meaning, as in Virg. *Æn.* iv. 217. But Oehler notices “subnexis” as a
conjecture of Jos. Scaliger, which is very plausible, and would mean
nearly the same. Mr. Dodgson renders “supported by their slavery;” and
Oehler makes “subnixis” ="præditis,” “instructis.” \[Elucidation II.\]

<span id="fn_9035"></span>[709:9036](0030795.htm#fr_9035.md) <span

<span id="vi.vii.iv-p10"></span> “Bestiis,” irrational creatures, as
opposed to “homines,” here apparently *wild* beasts.

id="vi.vii.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.iv-p11"></span> Obsequii. For the sentiment, compare
[Isa. i. 3](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.vii.iv-p11.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_9039"></span>[709:9040](0030795.htm#fr_9039.md) <span

their masters.”

id="vi.vii.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.iv-p16"></span> “Oblectatur” Oehler reads with the
<span class="sc"><span id="vi.vii.iv-p16.2"></span>mss.</span>  The
editors, as he says, have emended “Obluctatur,” which Mr. Dodgson reads.

principle of the *Præscriptio* are noteworthy, as interpreting its use
in the *Advs. Hæreses*.\]
