<span id="v.iv.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—If God Had Anyhow Checked
Man’s Liberty, Marcion Would Have Been Ready with Another and Opposite
Cavil. Man’s Fall Foreseen by God. Provision Made for It Remedially and
Consistently with His Truth and Goodness.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.vii-p2"></span>By such a conclusion all is
reserved <span id="fr_2800"></span>[2801](#fn_2800.md) unimpaired to God;
both His natural goodness, and the purposes of His governance and
foreknowledge, and the abundance of His power. You ought, however, to
deduct from God’s attributes both His supreme earnestness of
purpose <span id="fr_2801"></span>[2802](#fn_2801.md) and most excellent
truth in His whole creation, if you would cease to inquire whether
anything could have happened against the will of God. For, while holding
this earnestness and truth of the good God, which are indeed <span
id="fr_2802"></span>[2803](#fn_2802.md) capable of proof from the rational
creation, you will not wonder at the fact that God did not interfere to
prevent the occurrence of what He wished not to happen, in order that He
might keep from harm what He wished. For, since He had once for all
allowed (and, as we have shown, worthily allowed) to man freedom of will
and mastery of himself, surely He from His very authority in creation
permitted *these gifts* to be enjoyed: to be enjoyed, too, so far as lay
in Himself, according to His own character as God, that is, for good
(for who would permit anything hostile to himself?); and, so far as lay
in man, according to the impulses of his liberty (for who does not, when
giving anything to any one to enjoy, accompany the gift with a
permission to enjoy it with all his heart and will?). The necessary
consequence, <span id="fr_2803"></span>[2804](#fn_2803.md) therefore, was,
that God must separate from the liberty which He had once for all
bestowed upon man (in other words, keep within Himself), both His
foreknowledge and power, through which He might have prevented man’s
falling into danger when attempting wrongly to enjoy his liberty. Now,
if He had interposed, He would have rescinded the liberty of man’s will,
which He had permitted with set purpose, and in goodness. But, suppose
God had interposed; suppose Him to have abrogated man’s liberty, by
warning him from the tree, and keeping off the subtle serpent from his
interview with the woman; would not Marcion then exclaim, What a
frivolous, unstable, and faithless Lord, cancelling the gifts He had
bestowed!  Why did He allow any liberty of will, if He afterwards
withdrew it? Why withdraw it after allowing it? Let Him choose where to
brand Himself with error, either in His original constitution of man, or
in His subsequent abrogation thereof! If He had checked (man’s freedom),
would He not then seem to have been rather deceived, through want of
foresight into the future? But in giving it full scope, who would not
say that He did so in ignorance of the issue of things? God, however,
did foreknow that man would make a bad use of his created constitution;
and yet what can be so worthy of God as His earnestness of purpose, and
the truth of His created works, be they what they may?  Man must see, if
he failed to make the most of <span id="fr_2804"></span>[2805](#fn_2804.md)
the good gift he had received, how that he was himself guilty in respect
of the law which he did not choose to keep, and not that the Lawgiver
was committing a fraud against His own law, by not permitting its
injunctions to be fulfilled. Whenever you are inclined to indulge in
such censure <span id="fr_2805"></span>[2806](#fn_2805.md) (and it is the
most becoming for you) against the Creator, recall gently to your mind
in His behalf <span id="fr_2806"></span>[2807](#fn_2806.md) His
earnestness, and endurance, and truth, in having given
completeness <span id="fr_2807"></span>[2808](#fn_2807.md) to His creatures
both as rational and good.
