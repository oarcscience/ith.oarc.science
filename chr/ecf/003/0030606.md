<span id="v.viii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Other Passages Quoted from
St. Paul, Which Categorically Assert the Resurrection of the Flesh at
the Final Judgment.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxiv-p2"></span>The character of these times learn,
along with the Thessalonians. For we read: “How ye turned from idols to
serve the living and true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom
He raised from the dead, even Jesus.” <span
id="fr_7445"></span>[7446](#fn_7445) And again:  “For what is our hope,
or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our
Lord God, Jesus Christ, at His coming?” <span
id="fr_7446"></span>[7447](#fn_7446) Likewise:  “Before God, even our
Father, at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, with the whole company
of His saints.” <span id="fr_7447"></span>[7448](#fn_7447) He teaches
them that they must “not sorrow concerning them that are asleep,” and at
the same time explains to them the times of the resurrection, saying,
“For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also
which sleep in Jesus shall God bring with Him. For this we say unto you
by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the
coming of our Lord, shall not prevent them that are asleep. For the Lord
Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise
first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together
with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we be
ever with the Lord.” <span id="fr_7448"></span>[7449](#fn_7448) What
archangel’s voice, (I wonder), what trump of God is now heard, except it
be, forsooth, in the entertainments of the heretics? For, allowing that
the word of the gospel may be called “the trump of God,” since it was
still calling men, yet they must at that time either be dead as to the
body, that they may be able to rise again; and then how are they alive? 
Or else caught up into the clouds; and how then are they here? “Most
miserable,” no doubt, as the apostle declared them, are they “who in
this life only” shall be found to have hope: <span
id="fr_7449"></span>[7450](#fn_7449) they will have to be excluded while
they are with premature haste seizing that which is promised after this
life; erring concerning the truth, no less than Phygellus and
Hermogenes. <span id="fr_7450"></span>[7451](#fn_7450) Hence it is that
the Holy Ghost, in His greatness, foresee<span id="page_563">p.
563</span> <span id="v.viii.xxiv-Page_563"></span>ing clearly all such
interpretations as these, suggests (to the apostle), in this very
epistle of his to the Thessalonians, *as follows*: “But of the times and
the seasons, brethren, there is no necessity for my writing unto you. 
For ye yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord cometh as a
thief in the night. For when they shall say, ‘Peace,’ and ‘All things
are safe,’ then sudden destruction shall come upon them.” <span
id="fr_7451"></span>[7452](#fn_7451) Again, in the second *epistle* he
addresses them with even greater earnestness: “Now I beseech you,
brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering
together unto Him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor be troubled,
either by spirit, or by word,” that is, *the word* of false prophets,
“or by letter,” that is, *the letter* of false apostles, “as if from us,
as that the day of the Lord is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any
means. *For that day shall not come*, unless indeed there first come a
falling away,” he means indeed of this present empire, “and that man of
sin be revealed,” that is to say, Antichrist, “the son of perdition, who
opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or religion;
so that he sitteth in the temple of God, affirming that he is God.
Remember ye not, that when I was with you, I used to tell you these
things? And now ye know what detaineth, that he might be revealed in his
time. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now
hinders must hinder, until he be taken out of the way.” <span
id="fr_7452"></span>[7453](#fn_7452) What obstacle is there but the
Roman state, the falling away of which, by being scattered into ten
kingdoms, shall introduce Antichrist upon (its own ruins)?  “And then
shall be revealed the wicked one, whom the Lord shall consume with the
spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His
coming: *even him* whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all
power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of
unrighteousness in them that perish.” <span
