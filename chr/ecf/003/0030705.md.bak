<span id="v.xi.viii"></span>

<span id="v.xi.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.xi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Blastus, Two Theodoti,
Praxeas.</span>

<span id="v.xi.viii-p2"></span>In addition to all these, there is
likewise Blastus, who would latently introduce Judaism. For he says the
passover is not to be kept otherwise than according to the law of Moses,
on the fourteenth of the month. But who would fail to see that
evangelical grace is escheated if he recalls Christ to the Law?

<span id="v.xi.viii-p3"></span>Add to these Theodotus the Byzantine,
who, after being apprehended for Christ’s Name, and apostatizing, <span
id="fr_8411"></span>[8412](#fn_8411.md) ceased not to blaspheme against
Christ.  For he introduced a doctrine by which to affirm that Christ was
merely a human being, but deny His deity; teaching that He was born of
the Holy Spirit indeed of a virgin, but was a solitary and bare human
being, <span id="fr_8412"></span>[8413](#fn_8412.md) with no pre-eminence
above the rest (of mankind), but only that of righteousness.

<span id="v.xi.viii-p6"></span>After him brake out a second heretical
Theodotus, who again himself introduced a sister-sect, and says that the
human being Christ Himself <span id="fr_8413"></span>[8414](#fn_8413.md)
was merely conceived alike, and born, of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin
Mary, but that He was inferior to Melchizedek; because it is said of
Christ, “Thou art a priest unto eternity, after the order of
Melchizedek.” <span id="fr_8414"></span>[8415](#fn_8414.md) For that
Melchizedek, he says, was a heavenly Virtue of pre-eminent grace; in
that Christ acts for human beings, being made their Deprecator and
Advocate:  Melchizedek does so <span
id="fr_8415"></span>[8416](#fn_8415.md) for heavenly angels and Virtues.
For to such a degree, he says, is he better than Christ, that he is
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.xi.viii-p9.1"></span>ἀπάτωρ</span>
(fatherless), <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xi.viii-p9.2"></span>ἀμήτωρ</span> (motherless), <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.xi.viii-p9.3"></span>ἀγενεαλογητον</span>
(without genealogy), of whom neither the beginning nor the end has been
comprehended, nor can be comprehended. <span
id="fr_8416"></span>[8417](#fn_8416.md)

<span id="v.xi.viii-p11"></span>But after all these, again, one Praxeas
introduced a heresy which Victorinus <span
id="fr_8417"></span>[8418](#fn_8417.md) was careful to corroborate. He
asserts that Jesus Christ is God the Father Almighty.  Him he contends
to have been crucified, and suffered, and died; beside which, with a
profane and sacrilegious temerity, he maintains the proposition that He
is Himself sitting at His own right hand. <span
id="fr_8418"></span>[8419](#fn_8418.md)

<span id="v.xi.viii-p4"></span> Negavit. See *de Idol.* c. xxiii. note
1.

<span id="v.xi.viii-p5"></span> Hominem solitarium atque nudum. The
words seems to mean, destitute of anything *super*human.

<span id="fn_8413"></span>[654:8414](0030705.htm#fr_8413.md) <span
id="v.xi.viii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="v.xi.viii-p7"></span> Et ips*um* hominem Christum tantummodo.
I rather incline to read, as in the preceding sentence, “et ip*se*”:
“and himself affirms Christ to have been merely human, conceived alike,”
etc.

<span id="fn_8414"></span>[654:8415](0030705.htm#fr_8414.md) <span

<span id="v.xi.viii-p8"></span> See [Ps. cx.
4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004.md)<span id="v.xi.viii-p8.1"></span>,
and the references there.

<span id="fn_8415"></span>[654:8416](0030705.htm#fr_8415.md) <span
id="v.xi.viii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="v.xi.viii-p9"></span> The Latin here is very careless, unless,
with Routh, we suggest “et” for “eo,” and render: “and that what Christ
does,” etc., “Melchizedek does,” etc.

<span id="fn_8416"></span>[654:8417](0030705.htm#fr_8416.md) <span
id="v.xi.viii-p9.5"></span>

<span id="v.xi.viii-p10"></span> See [Heb. vii.
1-3](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#001.md)<span id="v.xi.viii-p10.1"></span>.

id="v.xi.viii-p11.2"></span>

<span id="v.xi.viii-p12"></span> Who he is, no one knows. Oehler
(following the lead of Fabricius on Philaster, cap. 49, p. 102) believes
the name to be a mistake for Victor, a bishop of Rome, who (see *Adv.
Prax.* c. i.) had held the episcopate when Praxeas was there. His
successor was Zephyrinus; and it is an ingenious conjecture of Oehler,
that these two names, the one written as a correction of the other, may
have been confused: thus, Victor/Zephrynus; and thus of the two may have
been made Victorinus.

<span id="fn_8418"></span>[654:8419](0030705.htm#fr_8418.md) <span
id="v.xi.viii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="v.xi.viii-p13"></span> The form and order of the words here
used are certainly remarkably similar to the expressions and order of
the “Apostles’ Creed.”
