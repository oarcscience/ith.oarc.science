<span id="vi.vii.i-p5"></span> ————————————

<span id="vi.vii.i-p6"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.i-p6.1"></span>Chapter I.—Of Patience Generally; And
Tertullian’s Own Unworthiness to Treat of It.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.i-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.vii.i-p7.1"></span>I fully</span> confess unto the Lord God that
it has been rash enough, if not even impudent, in *me* to have dared
compose a treatise on Patience, for *practising* which I am all unfit,
being a man of no goodness; <span id="fr_9013"></span>[9014](#fn_9013)
whereas it were becoming that such as have addressed themselves to the
demonstration and commendation of some particular thing, should
themselves first be conspicuous in the practice of that thing, and
should regulate the constancy of their commonishing by the authority of
their personal conduct, for fear their words blush at the deficiency of
their deeds. And would that this “blushing” would bring a remedy, so
that shame for *not* exhibiting that which we go to suggest to others
should prove a tutorship into exhibiting it; except that the magnitude
of some good things—just as of some ills too—is insupportable, so that
only the grace of divine inspiration is effectual for attaining and
practising them.  For what is *most* good rests *most* with God; nor
does any other than He who possesses it dispense it, as He deems meet to
each. And so to discuss about that which it is not given one to enjoy,
will be, as it were, a solace; after the manner of invalids, who since
they are without health, know not how to be silent about its blessings.
So I, most miserable, ever sick with the heats of *im*patience, must of
necessity sigh after, and invoke, and persistently plead for, that
health of patience which I possess not; while I recall to mind, and, in
the contemplation of my own weakness, digest, *the truth*, that the good
health of faith, and the soundness of the Lord’s discipline, accrue not
easily to any unless patience sit by his side. <span
id="fr_9014"></span>[9015](#fn_9014) So is patience set over the things
of God, that one can obey no precept, fulfil no work well-pleasing to
the Lord, if estranged from it. The good of it, even they who live
outside it, <span id="fr_9015"></span>[9016](#fn_9015) honour with the
name of highest virtue.  Philosophers indeed, who are accounted animals
of some considerable wisdom, assign it so high a place, that, while they
are mutually at discord with the various fancies of their sects and
rivalries of their sentiments, yet, having a community of regard for
patience alone, to this one of their pursuits they have joined in
granting peace: for it they conspire; for it they league; it, in their
affectation of <span id="fr_9016"></span>[9017](#fn_9016) virtue, they
unanimously pursue; concerning patience they exhibit all their
ostentation of wisdom. Grand testimony this is to it, in that it incites
even the vain schools of the world <span
id="fr_9017"></span>[9018](#fn_9017) unto praise and glory! Or is it
rather an injury, in that a thing divine is bandied among worldly
sciences? But let them look to that, who shall presently be ashamed of
their wisdom, destroyed and disgraced together with the world <span
id="fr_9018"></span>[9019](#fn_9018) (it lives in).
