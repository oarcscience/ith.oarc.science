<span id="v.ix.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—New Testament Passages Quoted. They
Attest the Same Truth of the Son’s Visibility Contrasted with the
Father’s Invisibility.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xv-p2"></span>If I fail in resolving this article (of our
faith) by passages which may admit of dispute <span
id="fr_7936"></span>[7937](#fn_7936.md) out of the Old Testament, I will
take out of the New Testament a confirmation of our view, that you may
not straightway attribute to the Father every possible (relation and
condition) which I ascribe to the Son. Behold, then, I find both in the
Gospels and in the (writings of the) apostles a visible and an invisible
God (revealed to us), under a manifest and personal distinction in the
condition of both. There is a certain emphatic saying by John: “No man
hath seen God at any time;” <span id="fr_7937"></span>[7938](#fn_7937.md)
meaning, of course, at any previous time.  But he has indeed taken away
all question of time, by saying that God had never been seen. The
apostle confirms this statement; for, speaking of God, he says, “Whom no
man hath seen, nor can see;” <span id="fr_7938"></span>[7939](#fn_7938.md)
because the man indeed would die who should see Him. <span
id="fr_7939"></span>[7940](#fn_7939.md) But the very same apostles testify
that they had both seen and “handled” Christ. <span
id="fr_7940"></span>[7941](#fn_7940.md) Now, if Christ is Himself both the
Father and the Son, how can He be both the Visible and the Invisible? In
order, however, to reconcile this diversity between the Visible and the
Invisible, will not some one on the other side argue that the two
statements are quite correct: that He was visible indeed in the flesh,
but was invisible before *His appearance in* the flesh; so that He who
as the Father was invisible before the flesh, is the same as the Son who
was visible in the flesh?  If, however, He is the same who was invisible
before the incarnation, how comes it that He was actually seen in
ancient times before (coming in) the flesh? And by parity of reasoning,
if He is the same who was visible after (coming in) the flesh, how
happens it that He is now declared to be invisible by the apostles?
*How, I repeat, can all this be*, unless it be that *He* is one, who
anciently was visible only in mystery and enigma, and became more
clearly visible by His incarnation, even the Word who was also made
flesh; whilst *He* is another whom no man has seen at any time, *being*
none else than the Father, even Him to whom the Word belongs? Let us, in
short, examine who it is whom the apostles saw. “That,” says John,
“which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our
hands have handled, of the Word of life.” <span
id="fr_7941"></span>[7942](#fn_7941.md) Now the Word of life became flesh,
and was heard, and was seen, and was handled, because He was flesh who,
before *He came in* the flesh, was the “Word in the beginning with God”
the Father, <span id="fr_7942"></span>[7943](#fn_7942.md) and not the
Father with the Word. For although the Word was God, yet was He with
God, because He is God of God; and being joined to the Father, is with
the Father. <span id="fr_7943"></span>[7944](#fn_7943.md) “And we have seen
His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father;” <span
id="fr_7944"></span>[7945](#fn_7944.md) that is, of course, <span
id="page_611">p. 611</span> <span id="v.ix.xv-Page_611"></span>(the
glory) of the Son, even Him who was visible, and was glorified by the
invisible Father. And therefore, inasmuch as he had said that the Word
of God was God, in order that he might give no help to the presumption
of the adversary, (which pretended) that he had seen the Father Himself
*and* in order to draw a distinction between the invisible Father and
the visible Son, he makes the additional assertion, *ex abundanti* as it
were: “No man hath seen God at any time.” <span
id="fr_7945"></span>[7946](#fn_7945.md) What God does he mean? The Word? 
But he has already said: “*Him* we have seen and heard, and our hands
have handled the Word of life.”  Well, (I must again ask,) what God does
he mean? It is of course the Father, with whom was the Word, the only
begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, and has Himself
declared Him. <span id="fr_7946"></span>[7947](#fn_7946.md) He was both
heard and seen and, that He might not be supposed to be a phantom, was
actually handled. Him, too, did Paul behold; but yet he saw not the
Father. “Have I not,” he says, “seen Jesus *Christ our Lord*?” <span
id="fr_7947"></span>[7948](#fn_7947.md) Moreover, he expressly called
Christ God, saying: “Of whom are the fathers, and of whom as concerning
the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.” <span
id="fr_7948"></span>[7949](#fn_7948.md) He shows us also that the Son of
God, which is the Word of God, is visible, because He who became flesh
was called Christ. Of the Father, however, he says to Timothy: “Whom
none among men hath seen, nor indeed can see;” and he accumulates the
description in still ampler terms: “Who only hath immortality, and
dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto.” <span
id="fr_7949"></span>[7950](#fn_7949.md) It was of Him, too, that he had
said in a previous passage: “Now unto the King eternal, immortal,
invisible, to the only God;” <span id="fr_7950"></span>[7951](#fn_7950.md)
so that we might apply even the contrary qualities to the Son
Himself—mortality, accessibility—of whom *the apostle* testifies that
“He died according to the Scriptures,” <span
id="fr_7951"></span>[7952](#fn_7951.md) and that “He was seen by himself
last of all,” <span id="fr_7952"></span>[7953](#fn_7952.md) —by means, of
course, of the light which was accessible, although it was not without
imperilling his sight that he experienced that light. <span
id="fr_7953"></span>[7954](#fn_7953.md) *A like danger to which also
befell* Peter, and John, and James, (who confronted not the same light)
without risking the loss of their reason and mind; and if they, who were
unable to endure the glory of the Son, <span
id="fr_7954"></span>[7955](#fn_7954.md) had only seen the Father, they must
have died then and there: “For no man shall see God, and live.” <span
id="fr_7955"></span>[7956](#fn_7955.md) This being the case, it is evident
that He was always seen from the beginning, who became visible in the
end; and that He, (on the contrary,) was not seen in the end who had
never been visible from the beginning; and that accordingly there are
two—the Visible and the Invisible. It was the Son, therefore, who was
always seen, and the Son who always conversed with men, and the Son who
has always worked by the authority and will of the Father; because “the
Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do” <span
id="fr_7956"></span>[7957](#fn_7956.md) —“do” that is, in His mind and
thought. <span id="fr_7957"></span>[7958](#fn_7957.md) For the Father acts
by mind and thought; whilst the Son, who is in the Father’s mind and
thought, <span id="fr_7958"></span>[7959](#fn_7958.md) gives effect and
form to what He sees.  Thus all things were made by the Son, and without
Him was not anything made. <span id="fr_7959"></span>[7960](#fn_7959.md)
