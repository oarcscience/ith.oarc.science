<span id="v.iv.iv.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Prophecies in Isaiah and the
Psalms Respecting Christ’s Humiliation.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xvii-p2"></span>Let us compare with Scripture the rest
of His dispensation.  Whatever that poor despised body <span
id="fr_3325"></span>[3326](#fn_3325.md) may be, because it was an object of
touch <span id="fr_3326"></span>[3327](#fn_3326.md) and sight, <span
id="fr_3327"></span>[3328](#fn_3327.md) it shall be my Christ, be He
inglorious, be He ignoble, be He dishonoured; for such was it announced
that He should be, both in bodily condition and aspect. Isaiah comes to
our help again: “We have announced (His way) before Him,” says he; “He
is like a servant, <span id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328.md) like a
root in a dry ground; He hath no form nor comeliness; we saw Him, and He
had neither form nor beauty; but His form was despised, marred above all
men.” <span id="fr_3329"></span>[3330](#fn_3329.md) Similarly the Father
addressed the Son just before: “Inasmuch as many will be astonished at
Thee, so also will Thy beauty be without glory from men.” <span
id="fr_3330"></span>[3331](#fn_3330.md) For although, in David’s words, He
is fairer than the children of men,” <span
id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331.md) yet it is in that figurative state
of spiritual grace, when He is girded with the sword of the Spirit,
which is verily His form, and beauty, and glory. According to the same
prophet, however, He is in bodily condition “a very worm, and no man; a
reproach of men, and an outcast of the people.” <span
id="fr_3332"></span>[3333](#fn_3332.md) But no internal quality of such a
kind does He announce as belonging to Him. In Him dwelt the fulness of
the Spirit; therefore I acknowledge Him to be “the rod of the stem of
Jesse.” His blooming flower shall be my Christ, upon whom hath rested,
according to Isaiah, “the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit
of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of piety, and of the
fear of the Lord.” <span id="fr_3333"></span>[3334](#fn_3333.md) Now to no
man, except Christ, would the diversity of spiritual proofs suitably
apply.  He is indeed like a flower for the Spirit’s grace, reckoned
indeed of the stem of Jesse, but thence to derive His descent through
Mary. Now I purposely demand of you, whether you grant to Him the
destination <span id="fr_3334"></span>[3335](#fn_3334.md) of all this
humiliation, and suffering, and tranquillity, from which He will be the
Christ of Isaiah,—a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, who was
led as a sheep to the slaughter, and who, like a lamb before the
shearer, opened <span id="page_336">p. 336</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.xvii-Page_336"></span>not His mouth; <span
id="fr_3335"></span>[3336](#fn_3335.md) who did not struggle nor cry, nor
was His voice heard in the street who broke not the bruised reed—that
is, the shattered faith of the Jews—nor quenched the smoking flax—that
is, the freshly-kindled <span id="fr_3336"></span>[3337](#fn_3336.md)
ardour of the Gentiles. He can be none other than the Man who was
foretold. It is right that His conduct <span
id="fr_3337"></span>[3338](#fn_3337.md) be investigated according to the
rule of Scripture, distinguishable as it is unless I am mistaken, by the
twofold operation of preaching <span
id="fr_3338"></span>[3339](#fn_3338.md) and of miracle. But the treatment
of both these topics I shall so arrange as to postpone, to the chapter
wherein I have determined to discuss the actual gospel of Marcion, the
consideration of His wonderful doctrines and miracles—with a view,
however, to our present purpose. Let us here, then, in general terms
complete the subject which we had entered upon, by indicating, as we
pass on, <span id="fr_3339"></span>[3340](#fn_3339.md) how Christ was
fore-announced by Isaiah as a preacher: “For who is there among you,”
says he, “that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of His
Son?” <span id="fr_3340"></span>[3341](#fn_3340.md) And likewise as a
healer: “For,” says he, “He hath taken away our infirmities, and carried
our sorrows.” <span id="fr_3341"></span>[3342](#fn_3341.md)
