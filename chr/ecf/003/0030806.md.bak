<span id="vi.vii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—General Summary of the Virtues
and Effects of Patience.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.xv-p2"></span>So amply sufficient a Depositary of
patience is God. If it be a wrong which you deposit in His care, He is
an Avenger; if a loss, He is a Restorer; if pain, He is a Healer; if
death, He is a Reviver. What honour is granted to Patience, to have God
as her Debtor! And not without reason: for she keeps all His decrees;
she has to do with all His mandates. She fortifies faith; is the pilot
of peace; assists charity; establishes humility; waits long for
repentance; sets her seal on confession; rules the flesh; preserves the
spirit; bridles the tongue; restrains the hand; tramples temptations
under foot; drives away scandals; gives their crowning grace to
martyrdoms; consoles the poor; teaches the rich moderation; overstrains
not the weak; exhausts not the strong; is the delight of the believer;
invites the Gentile; commends the servant to his lord, and his lord to
God; adorns the woman; makes the man approved; is loved in childhood,
praised in youth, looked up to in age; is beauteous in either sex, in
every time of life. Come, now, *see* whether <span
id="fr_9176"></span>[9177](#fn_9176.md) we have a general idea of her mien
and habit.  Her countenance is tranquil and peaceful; her brow
serene <span id="fr_9177"></span>[9178](#fn_9177.md) contracted by no
wrinkle of sadness or of anger; her eyebrows evenly relaxed <span
id="page_717">p. 717</span> <span id="vi.vii.xv-Page_717"></span>in
gladsome wise, with eyes downcast in humility, not in unhappiness; her
mouth sealed with the honourable mark of silence; her hue such as theirs
who are without care and without guilt; the motion of her head frequent
against the devil, and her laugh threatening; <span
id="fr_9178"></span>[9179](#fn_9178.md) her clothing, moreover, about her
bosom white and well fitted to her person, as being neither inflated nor
disturbed.  For *Patience* sits on the throne of that calmest and
gentlest Spirit, who is not found in the roll of the whirlwind, nor in
the leaden hue of the cloud, but is of soft serenity, open and simple,
whom Elias saw at his third essay. <span
id="fr_9179"></span>[9180](#fn_9179.md) For where God is, there too is His
foster-child, namely Patience. When God’s Spirit descends, then Patience
accompanies Him indivisibly. If we do not give admission *to her*
together with the Spirit, will (He) *always* tarry with us? Nay, I know
not whether He would remain *any longer*. Without His companion and
handmaid, He must of necessity be straitened in every place and at every
time. Whatever blow His enemy may inflict He will be unable to endure
alone, being without the instrumental means of enduring.

<span id="vi.vii.xv-p3"></span> Si. This is Oehler’s reading, who takes
“si” to be ="an.” But perhaps “sis” (="si vis”), which is Fr. Junius’
correction, is better:  “Come, now, let us, if you please, give a
general sketch of her mien and habit.”

<span id="fn_9177"></span>[716:9178](0030806.htm#fr_9177.md) <span

<span id="vi.vii.xv-p4"></span> Pura; perhaps “smooth.”

<span id="vi.vii.xv-p6"></span> i.e., as Rigaltius (referred to by
Oehler), explains, after the *two* visions of angels who appeared to him
and said, “Arise and eat.” See [1 Kings xix.
4-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004.md)<span id="vi.vii.xv-p6.1"></span>.
\[It was the *fourth*, but our author having mentioned *two*,
inadvertently calls it the *third*, referring to the “still small
voice,” in which Elijah *saw* His manifestation.\]
