id="vi.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Of Elevated Hands.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii-p2"></span>But we more commend our prayers to God
when we pray with modesty and humility, with not even our hands too
loftily elevated, but elevated temperately and becomingly; and not even
our countenance over-boldly uplifted. For that publican who prayed with
humility and dejection not merely in his supplication, but in his
countenance too, went his way “more justified” than the shameless
Pharisee. <span id="fr_8859"></span>[8860](#fn_8859.md) The sounds of our
voice, likewise, should be subdued; else, if we are to be heard for our
noise, how large windpipes should we need! But God is the hearer not of
the *voice*, but of the *heart*, just as He is its inspector. The demon
of the Pythian oracle says:

<span id="vi.iv.xvii-p4"></span>“And I do understand the mute, and
plainly hear the speechless one.” <span
id="fr_8860"></span>[8861](#fn_8860.md)

<span id="vi.iv.xvii-p6"></span>Do the ears of God wait for sound? How,
then, could Jonah’s prayer find way out unto heaven from the depth of
the whale’s belly, through the entrails of so huge a beast; from the
very abysses, through so huge a mass of sea? What superior advantage
will they who pray too loudly gain, except that they annoy their
neighbours? Nay, by making their petitions audible, what less error do
they commit than if they were to pray in public? <span
