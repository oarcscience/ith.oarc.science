<span id="v.iv.ii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Specific Points.  The
Novelty of Marcion’s God Fatal to His Pretensions. God is from
Everlasting, He Cannot Be in Any Wise New.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.viii-p2"></span>In the first place, how arrogantly do
the Marcionites build up their stupid system, <span
id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409.md) bringing forward a new god, as if
we were ashamed of the old one! So schoolboys are proud of their new
shoes, but their old master beats their strutting vanity out of them.
Now when I hear of a new god, <span id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410.md)
who, in the old world and in the old time and under the old god was
unknown and unheard of; whom, (*accounted as* no one through such long
centuries back, and ancient in men’s very ignorance of him), <span
id="fr_2411"></span>[2412](#fn_2411.md) a certain “Jesus Christ,” and none
else revealed; whom Christ revealed, *they say*—Christ himself new,
*according to them, even*, in ancient names—I feel grateful for this
conceit <span id="fr_2412"></span>[2413](#fn_2412.md) of theirs. For by its
help I shall at once be able to prove the heresy of their tenet of a new
deity. It will turn out to be such a novelty <span
id="fr_2413"></span>[2414](#fn_2413.md) as has made gods even for the
heathen by some new and yet again and ever new title <span
id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414.md) for each several deification. What
new god is there, except a false one? Not even Saturn will be proved to
be a god by all his ancient fame, because it was a novel pretence which
some time or other produced even him, when it first gave him
godship. <span id="fr_2415"></span>[2416](#fn_2415.md) On the contrary,
living and perfect <span id="fr_2416"></span>[2417](#fn_2416.md) Deity has
its origin <span id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417.md) neither in novelty
nor in antiquity, but in its own true nature. Eternity has no time. It
is itself all time. It acts; it cannot then suffer. It cannot be born,
therefore it lacks age. God, if old, forfeits the eternity that is to
come; if new, the eternity which is past. <span
id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418.md) The newness bears witness to a
beginning; the oldness threatens an end. God, moreover, is as
independent of beginning and end as He is of time, which is only the
arbiter and measurer of a beginning and an end.

<span id="v.iv.ii.viii-p5"></span> The original of this obscure passage
is: “Novum igitur audiens deum, in vetere mundo et in vetere ævo et sub
vetere deo inauditum quem tantis retro seculis neminem, et ipsa
ignorantia antiquum, quidam Jesus Christus, et ille in veteribus
nominibus novus, revelaverit, nec alius antehac.” The harsh expression,
“quidam Jesus Christus,” bears, of course, a sarcastic reference to the
capricious and inconsistent novelty which Marcion broached in his heresy
about Christ. \[By some slight chance in punctuation and arrangement, I
have endeavoured to make it a little clearer.\]
