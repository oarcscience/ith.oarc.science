<span id="v.viii.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVI.—It is the Works of the Flesh,
Not the Substance of the Flesh, Which St. Paul Always Condemns.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xlvi-p2"></span>You may notice that the apostle
everywhere condemns the works of the flesh in such a <span
id="page_579">p. 579</span> <span id="v.viii.xlvi-Page_579"></span>way
as to appear to condemn the flesh; but no one can suppose him to have
any such view as this, since he goes on to suggest another sense, even
though somewhat resembling it. For when he actually declares that “they
who are in the flesh cannot please God,” he immediately recalls the
statement from an heretical sense to a sound one, by adding, “But ye are
not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.” <span
id="fr_7588"></span>[7589](#fn_7588.md) Now, by denying them to be in the
flesh who yet obviously were in the flesh, he showed that they were not
living amidst the works of the flesh, and therefore that they who could
not please God were not those who were in the flesh, but only those who
were living after the flesh; whereas they pleased God, who, although
existing in the flesh, were yet walking after the Spirit. And, again, he
says that “the body is dead;” but it is “because of sin,” even as “the
Spirit is life because of righteousness.” <span
id="fr_7589"></span>[7590](#fn_7589.md) When, however, he thus sets life in
opposition to the death which is constituted in the flesh, he
unquestionably promises the life of righteousness to the same state for
which he determined the death of sin. But unmeaning is this opposition
which he makes between the “life” and the “death,” if the life is not
there where that very thing is to which he opposes it—even the death
which is to be extirpated of course from the body.  Now, if life thus
extirpates death from the body, it can accomplish this only by
penetrating thither where that is which it is excluding. But why am I
resorting to knotty arguments, <span
id="fr_7590"></span>[7591](#fn_7590.md) when the apostle treats the subject
with perfect plainness? “For if,” says he, “the Spirit of Him that
raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Jesus from
the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies, because of His Spirit
that dwelleth in you;” <span id="fr_7591"></span>[7592](#fn_7591.md) so
that even if a person were to assume that the soul is “the mortal body,”
he would (since he cannot possibly deny that the flesh is this also) be
constrained to acknowledge a restoration even of the flesh, in
consequence of its participation in the selfsame state.  From the
following words, moreover, you may learn that it is the works of the
flesh which are condemned, and not the flesh itself: “Therefore,
brethren, we are debtors, not *to the flesh*, to live after the flesh:
for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die; but if ye, through the
Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.” <span
id="fr_7592"></span>[7593](#fn_7592.md) Now (that I may answer each point
separately), since salvation is promised to those who are living in the
flesh, but walking after the Spirit, it is no longer the flesh which is
an adversary to salvation, but the working of the flesh.  When, however,
this operativeness of the flesh is done away with, which is the cause of
death, the flesh is shown to be safe, since it is freed from the cause
of death. “For the law,” says he, “of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus
hath made me free from the law of sin and death,” <span
id="fr_7593"></span>[7594](#fn_7593.md) —that, surely, which he previously
mentioned as dwelling in our members. <span
id="fr_7594"></span>[7595](#fn_7594.md) Our members, therefore, will no
longer be subject to the law of death, because they cease to serve that
of sin, from *both* which they have been set free. “For what the law
could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own
Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and through <span
id="fr_7595"></span>[7596](#fn_7595.md) sin condemned sin in the
flesh,” <span id="fr_7596"></span>[7597](#fn_7596.md) —not the flesh in
sin, for the house is not to be condemned with its inhabitant. He said,
indeed, that “sin dwelleth in our body.” <span
id="fr_7597"></span>[7598](#fn_7597.md) But the condemnation of sin is the
acquittal of the flesh, just as its non-condemnation subjugates it to
the law of sin and death. In like manner, he called “the carnal mind”
first “death,” <span id="fr_7598"></span>[7599](#fn_7598.md) and afterwards
“enmity against God;” <span id="fr_7599"></span>[7600](#fn_7599.md) but he
never predicated this of the flesh itself. But to what then, you will
say, must the carnal mind be ascribed, if it be not to the *carnal*
substance itself? I will allow your objection, if you will prove to me
that the flesh has any discernment of its own. If, however, it has no
conception of anything without the soul, you must understand that the
carnal mind must be referred to the soul, although ascribed sometimes to
the flesh, on the ground that it is ministered to for the flesh and
through the flesh. And therefore (the apostle) says that “sin dwelleth
in the flesh,” because the soul by which sin is provoked has its
temporary lodging in the flesh, which is doomed indeed to death, not
however on its own account, but on account of sin. For he says in
another passage also: “How is it that you conduct yourselves as if you
were even now living in the world?” <span
id="fr_7600"></span>[7601](#fn_7600.md) where he is not writing to dead
persons, but to those who ought to have ceased to live after the ways of
the world.
