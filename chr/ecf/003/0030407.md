<span id="v.iv.v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Other Proofs from the Same
Chapter, that Jesus, Who Preached at Nazareth, and Was Acknowledged by
Certain Demons as Christ the Son of God, Was the Creator’s Christ. As
Occasion Offers, the Docetic Errors of Marcion are Exposed.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.viii-p2"></span>The Christ of the Creator had <span
id="fr_3676"></span>[3677](#fn_3676.md) to be called a *Nazarene* according
to prophecy; whence the Jews also designate us, on that very
account, <span id="fr_3677"></span>[3678](#fn_3677.md) *Nazerenes* <span
id="fr_3678"></span>[3679](#fn_3678.md) after Him. For we are they of whom
it is written, “Her Nazarites were whiter than snow;” <span
id="fr_3679"></span>[3680](#fn_3679.md) even they who were once defiled
with the stains of sin, and darkened with the clouds of ignorance. But
to Christ the title Nazarene was destined to become a suitable one, from
the hiding-place of His infancy, for which He went down and dwelt at
Nazareth, <span id="fr_3680"></span>[3681](#fn_3680.md) to escape from
Archelaus the son of Herod.  This fact I have not refrained from
mentioning on this account, because it behoved Marcion’s Christ to have
forborne all connection whatever with the *domestic* localities of the
Creator’s Christ, when he had so many towns in Judæa which had not been
by the prophets thus assigned <span id="fr_3681"></span>[3682](#fn_3681.md)
to the Creator’s Christ. But Christ will be (the Christ) of the
prophets, wheresoever He is found in accordance with the prophets. And
yet even at Nazareth He is not remarked as having preached anything
new, <span id="fr_3682"></span>[3683](#fn_3682.md) whilst in another
*verse* He is said to have been rejected <span
id="fr_3683"></span>[3684](#fn_3683.md) by reason of a simple
proverb. <span id="fr_3684"></span>[3685](#fn_3684.md) Here at once, when I
observe that they laid their hands on Him, I cannot help drawing a
conclusion respecting His bodily substance, which cannot be believed to
have been a phantom, <span id="fr_3685"></span>[3686](#fn_3685.md) since it
was capable of being touched and even violently handled, when He was
seized and taken and led to the very brink of a precipice. For although
He escaped through the midst of them, He had already experienced their
rough treatment, and afterwards went His way, no doubt <span
id="fr_3686"></span>[3687](#fn_3686.md) because the crowd (as usually
happens) gave way, or was even broken through; but not because it was
eluded as by an impalpable disguise, <span
id="fr_3687"></span>[3688](#fn_3687.md) which, if there had been such,
would not at all have submitted to any touch.

<span id="v.iv.v.viii-p15"></span>“Tangere enim et tangi, nisi corpus,
nulla potest res,” <span id="fr_3688"></span>[3689](#fn_3688.md)

<span id="v.iv.v.viii-p17"></span>is even a sentence worthy of a place
in the world’s wisdom. In short, He did himself touch others, upon whom
He laid His hands, which were capable of being felt, and conferred the
blessings of healing, <span id="fr_3689"></span>[3690](#fn_3689.md) which
were not less true, not less unimaginary, than were the hands wherewith
He bestowed them. He was therefore the very Christ of Isaiah, the healer
of our sicknesses. <span id="fr_3690"></span>[3691](#fn_3690.md) “Surely,”
says he, “He hath borne our griefs and *carried* our sorrows.” Now the
Greeks are accustomed to use for *carry* a word which also signifies to
*take away*. A general promise is enough for me in passing. <span
id="fr_3691"></span>[3692](#fn_3691.md) Whatever were the cures which Jesus
effected, He is mine. We will come, however, to the kinds of cures. To
liberate men, then, from evil spirits, is a cure of sickness. 
Accordingly, wicked spirits (just in the manner of our former example)
used to go forth with a testimony, exclaiming, “Thou art the Son of
God,” <span id="fr_3692"></span>[3693](#fn_3692.md) —of what God, is clear
enough from the case itself.  But they were rebuked, and ordered not to
speak; precisely because <span id="fr_3693"></span>[3694](#fn_3693.md)
Christ willed Himself to be proclaimed by *men*, not by unclean spirits,
as the Son of God—even that Christ alone to whom this was befitting,
because He had sent beforehand men through whom He might become known,
and who were assuredly worthier preachers. It was natural to Him <span
id="fr_3694"></span>[3695](#fn_3694.md) to refuse the proclamation of an
unclean spirit, at whose command there was an abundance of saints. He,
however, <span id="fr_3695"></span>[3696](#fn_3695.md) who had never been
foretold (if, indeed, he wished to be acknowledged; for if he did not
wish so much, his coming was in vain), would not have spurned the
testimony of an alien or any sort of substance, who did not happen to
have a substance of his own, <span id="fr_3696"></span>[3697](#fn_3696.md)
but had descended in an alien one. And now, too, as the destroyer also
of the Creator, he would have desired nothing better <span
id="page_355">p. 355</span> <span id="v.iv.v.viii-Page_355"></span>than
to be acknowledged by *His* spirits, and to be divulged for the sake of
being feared: <span id="fr_3697"></span>[3698](#fn_3697.md) only that
Marcion says <span id="fr_3698"></span>[3699](#fn_3698.md) that his god is
not feared; maintaining that a good being is not an object of fear, but
only a judicial being, in whom reside the grounds <span
id="fr_3699"></span>[3700](#fn_3699.md) of fear—anger, severity, judgments,
vengeance, condemnation. But it was from fear, undoubtedly, that the
evil spirits were cowed. <span id="fr_3700"></span>[3701](#fn_3700.md)
Therefore they confessed that (Christ) was the Son of a God who was to
be feared, because they would have an occasion of not submitting if
there were none for fearing.  Besides, He showed that He was to be
feared, because He drave them out, not by persuasion like a good being,
but by command and reproof. Or else did he <span
id="fr_3701"></span>[3702](#fn_3701.md) reprove them, because they were
making him an object of fear, when all the while he did not want to be
feared? And in what manner did he wish them to go forth, when they could
not do so except with fear? So that he fell into the dilemma <span
id="fr_3702"></span>[3703](#fn_3702.md) of having to conduct himself
contrary to his nature, whereas he might in his simple goodness have at
once treated them with leniency. He fell, too, into another false
position <span id="fr_3703"></span>[3704](#fn_3703.md) —of prevarication,
when he permitted himself to be feared by the demons as the Son of the
Creator, that he might drive them out, not indeed by his own power, but
by the authority of the Creator. “He departed, and went into a desert
place.” <span id="fr_3704"></span>[3705](#fn_3704.md) This was, indeed, the
Creator’s customary region. It was proper that the Word <span
id="fr_3705"></span>[3706](#fn_3705.md) should there appear in body, where
He had aforetime, wrought in a cloud. To the gospel also was suitable
that condition of place <span id="fr_3706"></span>[3707](#fn_3706.md) which
had once been determined on for the law. <span
id="fr_3707"></span>[3708](#fn_3707.md) “Let the wilderness and the
solitary place, therefore, be glad and rejoice;” so had Isaiah
promised. <span id="fr_3708"></span>[3709](#fn_3708.md) When “stayed” by
the crowds, He said, “I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities
also.” <span id="fr_3709"></span>[3710](#fn_3709.md) Had He displayed His
God anywhere yet? I suppose as yet nowhere. But was He speaking of those
who knew of another god also? I do not believe so. If, therefore,
neither He had preached, nor they had known, any other God but the
Creator, He was announcing the kingdom of that God whom He knew to be
the only God known to those who were listening to Him.
