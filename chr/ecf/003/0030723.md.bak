id="vi.iii.i-p5.1"></span>Chapter I.—Introduction. Origin of the
Treatise.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.i-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iii.i-p6.1"></span>Happy</span> is our <span
id="fr_8541"></span>[8542](#fn_8541.md) sacrament of water, in that, by
washing away the sins of our early blindness, we are set free *and
admitted* into eternal life! A treatise on this matter will not be
superfluous; instructing not only such as are just becoming formed (in
the faith), but them who, content with having simply believed, without
full examination of the grounds <span
id="fr_8542"></span>[8543](#fn_8542) of the traditions, carry (in mind.md),
through ignorance, an untried *though* probable faith. The consequence
is, that a viper of the Cainite heresy, lately conversant in this
quarter, has carried away a great number with her most venomous
doctrine, making it her first aim to destroy baptism. Which is quite in
accordance with nature; for vipers and asps and basilisks themselves
generally do affect arid and waterless places. But we, little fishes,
after the example of our <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i-p8.1"></span>ΙΧΘΥΣ</span> <span
id="fr_8543"></span>[8544](#fn_8543.md) Jesus Christ, are born in water,
nor have we safety in any other way than by permanently abiding in
water; so that most monstrous creature, who had no right to teach even
sound doctrine, <span id="fr_8544"></span>[8545](#fn_8544.md) knew full
well how to kill the little fishes, by taking them away from the water!

<span id="vi.iii.i-p9"></span> This curious allusion it is impossible,
perhaps, to render in our language. The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i-p9.1"></span>ΙΧΘΥΣ</span> (*<span class="c42"><span
id="vi.iii.i-p9.2"></span>ikhthus</span>*) in Greek means “a fish;” and
it was used as a name for our Lord Jesus, because the initials of the
words <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.i-p9.3"></span>᾽Ιησοῦς
Χριστὸς Θεοῦ Υἰὸς Σωτήρ</span> (i.e. Jesus Christ the Son of God, the
Savior), make up that word. <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iii.i-p9.5"></span>Oehler</span> with these remarks, gives
abundant references on that point. \[Dr. Allix suspects Montanism here,
but see Kaye, p. 43, and Lardner, *Credib.* II. p. 335. We may date it
*circa* <span class="sc"><span id="vi.iii.i-p9.6"></span>a.d</span>.
