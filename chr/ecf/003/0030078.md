<span id="iv.iv.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Concerning Idolatry in
Words.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xx-p2"></span>But, however, since the conduct according
to the divine rule is imperilled, not merely by deeds, but likewise by
words, (for, just as it is written, “Behold the man and his
deeds;” <span id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md) so, “Out of thy own
mouth shalt thou be justified” <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md)
), we ought to remember that, even in *words*, also the inroad of
idolatry must be foreguarded against, either from the defect of custom
or of timidity. The law prohibits the gods of the nations from being
named, <span id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323.md) not of course that we are
not to pronounce their names, the speaking of which common intercourse
extorts from us: for this must very frequently be said, “You find him in
the temple of Æsculapius;” and, “I live in Isis Street;” and, “He has
been made priest of Jupiter;” and much else after this manner, since
even on *men* names of this kind are bestowed. I do not honour Saturnus
if I call a man so, by his own name. I honour him no more than I do
Marcus, if I call a man Marcus. But it says, “Make not mention of the
name of other gods, neither be it heard from thy mouth.” <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) The precept it gives is <span
id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span id="iv.iv.xx-Page_74"></span>this, that
we do not call them *gods*. For in the first part of the law, too, “Thou
shalt not,” saith He, “use the name of the Lord thy God in a vain
thing,” <span id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md) that is, in an
idol. <span id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md) Whoever, therefore,
honours an idol with the name of God, has fallen into idolatry.  But if
I speak of them as gods, something must be added to make it appear that
*I* do not call them gods. For even the Scripture names “gods,” but adds
“their,” viz. “of the nations:” just as David does when he had named
“gods,” where he says, “But the gods of the nations are demons.” <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md) But this has been laid by me rather as
a foundation for ensuing observations.  However, it is a defect of
custom to say, “By Hercules, So help me the god of faith;” <span
id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328.md) while to the *custom* is added the
*ignorance* of some, who are ignorant that it is an oath by Hercules.
Further, what will an oath be, in the name of gods whom you have
forsworn, but a collusion of faith with idolatry? For who does not
honour them in whose name he swears?

<span id="iv.iv.xx-p10"></span> Mehercule. Medius Fidius. I have given
the rendering of the latter, which seems preferred by Paley (Ov. *Fast.*
vi. 213, note), who considers it = *me dius* (i.e., *Deus*) *fidius
juvet*.  Smith (*Lat. Dict. s.v*.) agrees with him, and explains it, *me
deus fidius servet*. White and Riddle (*s.v*.) take the *me* (which
appears to be *short*) as a “demonstrative” particle or prefix, and
explain, “By the God of truth!” “As true as heaven,” “Most certainly.”
