<span id="iv.iv.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Idolatry: Origin and Meaning of
the Name.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p2"></span>Idol in ancient times there was none.
Before the artificers of this monstrosity had bubbled into being, <span
id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) temples stood solitary and shrines
empty, just as to the present day in some places traces of the ancient
practice remain permanently. Yet idolatry used to be practised, not
under that name, but in that function; for even at this day it can be
practised outside a temple, and without an idol.  But when the devil
introduced into the world artificers of statues and of images, and of
every kind of likenesses, that former rude business of human disaster
attained from idols both a name and a development. Thenceforward every
art which in any way produces an idol instantly became a fount of
idolatry. For it makes no difference whether a moulder cast, or a carver
grave, or an embroiderer weave *the idol*; because neither is it a
question of material, whether an idol be formed of gypsum, or of colors,
or of stone, or of bronze, <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) or of
silver, or of thread. For since even without an idol idolatry is
committed, when the idol is there it makes no difference of what kind it
be, of what material, or what shape; lest any should think *that* only
to be held an idol which is consecrated in human shape. To establish
this point, the interpretation of the word is requisite. *Eidos*, in
Greek, signifies *form*; *eidolon*, derived diminutively from that, by
an equivalent process in our language, makes *formling*. <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) Every *form* or *formling*, therefore,
claims to be called an *idol*. Hence *idolatry* is “all attendance and
service about every idol.” Hence also, every artificer of an idol is
guilty of one and the same crime, <span
id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) unless, the People <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) which consecrated for itself the
likeness of a calf, and not of a man, fell short of incurring the guilt
of idolatry. <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md)
