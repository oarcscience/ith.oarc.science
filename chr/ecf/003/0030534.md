<span id="v.vi.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Palpable Absurdities and
Contradictions in the System Respecting Achamoth and the
Demiurge.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xix-p2"></span>And yet there is not any agreement between
the propriety of the names and that of the works, from which all the
names are suggested; since all of them ought to have borne the name of
her by whom the things were done, unless after all <span
id="fr_6809"></span>[6810](#fn_6809) it turn out that they were not made
by her.  For, although they say that Achamoth devised these forms in
honour of the Æons, they yet <span id="fr_6810"></span>[6811](#fn_6810)
transfer this *work* to Soter as its author, when they say that he <span
id="fr_6811"></span>[6812](#fn_6811) operated through her, so far as to
give her the very image of the invisible and unknown Father—that is, the
image which was unknown and invisible to the Demiurge; whilst he <span
id="fr_6812"></span>[6813](#fn_6812) formed this same Demiurge in
imitation <span id="fr_6813"></span>[6814](#fn_6813) of Nus the son *of
Propator*; <span id="fr_6814"></span>[6815](#fn_6814) and whilst the
archangels, who were the work of the Demiurge, resembled the other Æons.
Now, when I hear of such images of the three, I ask, do you not wish me
to laugh at these pictures of their most extravagant painter? At the
female Achamoth, a picture of the Father?  At the Demiurge, ignorant of
his mother, much more so of his father? At the picture of Nus, ignorant
of his father too, and the ministering angels, facsimiles of their
lords? This is painting a mule from an ass, and sketching Ptolemy from
Valentinus.

<span id="v.vi.xix-p8"></span> There seems to be a relative gradation
meant among these *<span class="c42"><span
id="v.vi.xix-p8.1"></span>extra-Pleroma</span>* beings, as there was
among the Æons of the Pleroma; and, further, a relation between the two
sets of beings—Achamoth bearing a relation to Propator, the Demiurge to
Nus, etc.
