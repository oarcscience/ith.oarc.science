<span id="vi.iv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The Fifth Clause.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi-p2"></span>But how gracefully has the Divine Wisdom
arranged the order of the prayer; so that *after* things heavenly—that
is, after the “Name” of God, the “Will” of God, and the “Kingdom” of
God—it should give earthly necessities also room for a petition! For the
Lord had <span id="fr_8796"></span>[8797](#fn_8796.md) withal issued His
edict, “Seek ye first the kingdom, and then even these shall be
added:” <span id="fr_8797"></span>[8798](#fn_8797.md) albeit we may rather
understand, “Give us this day our daily bread,” *spiritually*. For
*Christ* is our Bread; because Christ is Life, and bread is life. “I
am,” saith He, “the Bread of Life;” <span
id="fr_8798"></span>[8799](#fn_8798.md) and, a little above, “The Bread is
the Word of the living God, who came down from the heavens.” <span
id="fr_8799"></span>[8800](#fn_8799.md) Then *we find*, too, that His body
is reckoned in bread: “This is my body.” <span
id="fr_8800"></span>[8801](#fn_8800.md) And so, in petitioning for “daily
bread,” we ask for perpetuity in Christ, and indivisibility from His
body. But, because that word is admissible in a carnal sense too, it
cannot be so used without the religious remembrance withal of spiritual
Discipline; for (the Lord) commands that *bread* be prayed for, which is
the only *food* necessary for believers; for “all other things the
nations seek after.” <span id="fr_8801"></span>[8802](#fn_8801.md) The like
lesson He both inculcates by examples, and repeatedly handles in
parables, when He says, “Doth a father take away *bread* from his
children, and hand it to dogs?” <span
id="fr_8802"></span>[8803](#fn_8802.md) and again, “Doth a father give his
son a stone when he asks for *bread*?” <span
id="fr_8803"></span>[8804](#fn_8803.md) For He *thus* shows what it is that
sons expect from their father. Nay, even that nocturnal knocker knocked
for “*bread*.” <span id="fr_8804"></span>[8805](#fn_8804.md) Moreover, He
justly added, “Give us *this day*,” seeing He had previously said, “Take
no careful thought about the morrow, what ye are to eat.” <span
id="fr_8805"></span>[8806](#fn_8805.md) To which subject He also adapted
the parable of the man who pondered on an enlargement of his barns for
his forthcoming fruits, and on seasons of prolonged security; but that
very night he dies. <span id="fr_8806"></span>[8807](#fn_8806.md)

id="vi.iv.vi-p2.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi-p3"></span> This is a slight mistake of Tertullian.
The words referred to, “Seek ye first,” etc., do not occur till the
*end* of the chapter in which the prayer is found, so that his
pluperfect is out of place. \[He must have been aware of this: he only
gives logical order to the thought which existed in the divine mind. See
note 10, p. 682.\]
