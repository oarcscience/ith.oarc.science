<span id="v.iv.v.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Concerning the Centurion’s
Faith. The Raising of the Widow’s Son. John Baptist, and His Message to
Christ; And the Woman Who Was a Sinner. Proofs Extracted from All of the
Relation of Christ to the Creator.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xviii-p2"></span>Likewise, when extolling the
centurion’s faith, how incredible a thing it is, that *He* should
confess that He had “found so great a faith not even in Israel,” <span
id="fr_4136"></span>[4137](#fn_4136.md) to whom Israel’s faith was in no
way interesting! <span id="fr_4137"></span>[4138](#fn_4137.md) But not from
the fact (here stated by Christ) <span
id="fr_4138"></span>[4139](#fn_4138.md) could it have been of any interest
to Him to approve and compare what was hitherto crude, nay, I might say,
hitherto naught. Why, however, might He not have used the example of
faith in another <span id="fr_4139"></span>[4140](#fn_4139.md) god?
Because, <span id="page_375">p. 375</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xviii-Page_375"></span>if He had done so, He would have said
that no such faith had ever had existence in Israel; but as the case
stands, <span id="fr_4140"></span>[4141](#fn_4140.md) He intimates that He
ought to have found so great a faith in Israel, inasmuch as He had
indeed come for the purpose of finding it, being in truth the God and
Christ of Israel, and had now stigmatized <span
id="fr_4141"></span>[4142](#fn_4141.md) it, only as one who would enforce
and uphold it. If, indeed, He had been its antagonist, <span
id="fr_4142"></span>[4143](#fn_4142.md) He would have preferred finding it
to be such faith, <span id="fr_4143"></span>[4144](#fn_4143.md) having come
to weaken and destroy it rather than to approve of it. He raised also
the widow’s son from death. <span id="fr_4144"></span>[4145](#fn_4144.md)
This was not a strange miracle. <span
id="fr_4145"></span>[4146](#fn_4145.md) The Creator’s prophets had wrought
such; then why not His Son much rather? Now, so evidently had the Lord
Christ introduced no other god for the working of so momentous a miracle
as this, that all who were present gave glory to the Creator, saying: “A
great prophet is risen up among us, and God hath visited His
people.” <span id="fr_4146"></span>[4147](#fn_4146.md) What God?  He, of
course, whose people they were, and from whom had come their prophets.
But if they glorified the Creator, and Christ (on hearing them, and
knowing their meaning) refrained from correcting them even in their very
act of invoking <span id="fr_4147"></span>[4148](#fn_4147.md) the Creator
in that vast manifestation *of His glory* in this raising of the dead,
undoubtedly He either announced no other God but Him, whom He thus
permitted to be honoured in His own beneficent acts and miracles, or
else how happens it that He quietly permitted these persons to remain so
long in their error, especially as He came for the very purpose to cure
them of their error? But John is offended <span
id="fr_4148"></span>[4149](#fn_4148.md) when he hears of the miracles of
Christ, as of an alien god. <span id="fr_4149"></span>[4150](#fn_4149.md)
Well, I on my side <span id="fr_4150"></span>[4151](#fn_4150.md) will first
explain the reason of his offence, that I may the more easily explode
the scandal <span id="fr_4151"></span>[4152](#fn_4151.md) of our heretic.
Now, that the very Lord Himself of all might, the Word and Spirit of the
Father, <span id="fr_4152"></span>[4153](#fn_4152.md) was operating and
preaching on earth, it was necessary that the portion of the Holy Spirit
which, in the form of the prophetic gift, <span
id="fr_4153"></span>[4154](#fn_4153.md) had been through John preparing the
ways of the Lord, should now depart from John, <span
id="fr_4154"></span>[4155](#fn_4154.md) and return back again of course to
the Lord, as to its all-embracing original. <span
id="fr_4155"></span>[4156](#fn_4155.md) Therefore John, being now an
ordinary person, and only one of the many, <span
id="fr_4156"></span>[4157](#fn_4156.md) was offended indeed as a man, but
not because he expected or thought of another Christ as teaching or
doing nothing new, for he was not even expecting such a one. <span
id="fr_4157"></span>[4158](#fn_4157.md) Nobody will entertain doubts about
any one whom (since he knows him not to exist) he has no expectation or
thought of. Now John was quite sure that there was no other God but the
Creator, even as a Jew, especially as a prophet. <span
id="fr_4158"></span>[4159](#fn_4158.md) Whatever doubt he felt was
evidently rather <span id="fr_4159"></span>[4160](#fn_4159.md) entertained
about Him <span id="fr_4160"></span>[4161](#fn_4160.md) whom he knew indeed
to exist but knew not whether He were the very *Christ*.  With this
fear, therefore, even John asks the question, “Art thou He that should
come, or look we for another?” <span
id="fr_4161"></span>[4162](#fn_4161.md) —simply inquiring whether He was
come as He whom he was looking for. “Art thou He that should come?”
*i.e.* Art thou the coming One? “or look we for another?” *i.e.* Is He
whom we are expecting some other than Thou, if Thou art not He whom we
expect to come? For he was supposing, <span
id="fr_4162"></span>[4163](#fn_4162.md) as all men then thought, from the
similarity of the miraculous evidences, <span
id="fr_4163"></span>[4164](#fn_4163.md) that a prophet might possibly have
been meanwhile sent, from whom the Lord Himself, whose coming was then
expected, was different, and to whom He was superior. <span
id="fr_4164"></span>[4165](#fn_4164.md) And there lay John’s
difficulty. <span id="fr_4165"></span>[4166](#fn_4165.md) He was in doubt
whether He was actually come whom all men were looking for; whom,
moreover, they ought to have recognised by His predicted works, even as
the Lord sent word to John, that it was by means of these very works
that He was to be recognised. <span id="fr_4166"></span>[4167](#fn_4166.md)
Now, inasmuch as these predictions evidently related to the Creator’s
Christ—as we have proved in the examination of each of them—it was
perverse enough, if he gave himself <span id="page_376">p. 376</span>
<span id="v.iv.v.xviii-Page_376"></span>out to be *not* the Christ of
the Creator, and rested the proof of his statement on those very
evidences whereby he was urging his claims to be received as the
Creator’s Christ. Far greater still is his perverseness when, not being
the Christ of John, <span id="fr_4167"></span>[4168](#fn_4167.md) he yet
bestows on John his testimony, affirming him to be a prophet, nay more,
his messenger, <span id="fr_4168"></span>[4169](#fn_4168.md) applying to
him the Scripture, “Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which
shall prepare thy way before thee.” <span
id="fr_4169"></span>[4170](#fn_4169.md) He graciously <span
id="fr_4170"></span>[4171](#fn_4170.md) adduced the prophecy in the
superior sense of the alternative mentioned by the perplexed John, in
order that, by affirming that His own precursor was already come in the
person of John, He might quench the doubt <span
id="fr_4171"></span>[4172](#fn_4171.md) which lurked in his question: “Art
thou He that should come, or look we for another?”  Now that the
forerunner had fulfilled his mission, and the way of the Lord was
prepared, He ought now to be acknowledged as that (Christ) for whom the
forerunner had made ready the way. *That forerunner was* indeed “greater
than all of women born;” <span id="fr_4172"></span>[4173](#fn_4172.md) but
for all that, He who was least in the kingdom of God <span
id="fr_4173"></span>[4174](#fn_4173.md) was not subject to him; <span
id="fr_4174"></span>[4175](#fn_4174.md) as if the kingdom in which the
least person was greater than John belonged to one God, while John, who
was greater than all of women born, belonged himself to another God. For
whether He speaks of *any* “least person” by reason of his humble
position, or of Himself, as being thought to be less than John—since all
were running into the wilderness after John rather than after Christ
(“What went ye out into the wilderness to see?” <span
id="fr_4175"></span>[4176](#fn_4175) .md)—the Creator has equal right <span
id="fr_4176"></span>[4177](#fn_4176.md) to claim as His own both John,
greater than any born of women, and Christ, or every “least person *in
the kingdom of heaven*,” who was destined to be greater than John in
that kingdom, although equally pertaining to the Creator, and who would
be so much greater than the prophet, <span
id="fr_4177"></span>[4178](#fn_4177.md) because he would not have been
offended at Christ, *an infirmity* which then lessened *the greatness
of* John. We have already spoken of the forgiveness <span
id="fr_4178"></span>[4179](#fn_4178.md) of sins. The behaviour of “the
woman which was a sinner,” when she covered the Lord’s feet with her
kisses, bathed them with her tears, wiped them with the hairs of her
head, anointed them with ointment, <span
id="fr_4179"></span>[4180](#fn_4179.md) produced an evidence that what she
handled was not an empty phantom, <span
id="fr_4180"></span>[4181](#fn_4180.md) but a really solid body, and that
her repentance as a sinner deserved forgiveness according to the mind of
the Creator, who is accustomed to prefer mercy to sacrifice. <span
id="fr_4181"></span>[4182](#fn_4181.md) But even if the stimulus of her
repentance proceeded from her faith, she heard her justification by
faith through her repentance pronounced in the words, “Thy faith hath
saved thee,” by Him who had declared by Habakkuk, “The just shall live
by his faith.” <span id="fr_4182"></span>[4183](#fn_4182.md)

<span id="v.iv.v.xviii-p41"></span> Comp. the Refutation of Epiphanius
(*Hæres*. xlii. *Refut*. 8): “Whether with reference to John or to the
Saviour, He pronounces a blessing on such as should not be offended in
Himself or in John.  Nor should they devise for themselves whatsoever
things they heard not from him. He also has a greater object in view, on
account of which the Saviour said this; even that no one should think
that John (who was pronounced to be greater than any born of women) was
greater than the Saviour Himself, because even He was born of a woman.
He guards against this mistake, and says, ‘Blessed is he who shall not
be offended in me.’ He then adds, ‘He that is least in the kingdom of
heaven is greater than he.’  Now, in respect of His birth in the flesh,
the Saviour was less than he by the space of six months. But in the
kingdom He was greater, being even his God.  For the Only-begotten came
not to say aught in secret, or to utter a falsehood in His preaching, as
He says Himself, ‘In secret have I said nothing, but in public,’ etc.
