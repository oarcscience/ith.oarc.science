<span id="v.iii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Appeal, in Discussion of Heresy,
Lies Not to the Scriptures. The Scriptures Belong Only to Those Who Have
the Rule of Faith.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xix-p2"></span>Our appeal, therefore, must not be made
to the Scriptures; nor must controversy be admitted on points in which
victory will either be impossible, <span
id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045.md) or uncertain, or not certain
enough. <span id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046.md) But even if a
discussion from the Scriptures <span
id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047.md) should not turn out in such a way
as to place both sides on a par, (yet) the natural order of things would
require that this point should be first proposed, which is now the only
one which we must discuss: “With whom lies that very faith to which the
Scriptures belong. <span id="fr_2048"></span>[2049](#fn_2048.md) From what
and through whom, and when, and to whom, has been handed down that
rule, <span id="fr_2049"></span>[2050](#fn_2049.md) by which men become
Christians?” For wherever it shall be manifest that the true Christian
rule and faith shall be, <span id="page_252">p. 252</span> <span
id="v.iii.xix-Page_252"></span>*there* will likewise be the true
Scriptures and expositions thereof, and all the Christian traditions.
