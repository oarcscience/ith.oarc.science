<span id="v.x.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.x.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.</span>

<span id="v.x.xv-p2"></span>Now, then, the epistles of the apostles also
are well known. And do *we*, (you say), in all respects guileless souls
and doves merely, love to go astray? I should think from eagerness to
live. But let it be so, that meaning departs from their epistles. And
yet, that the apostles endured such sufferings, we know:  the teaching
is clear. This only I perceive in running through the Acts.  I am not at
all on the search.  The prisons there, and the bonds, and the scourges,
and the big stones, and the swords, and the onsets by the Jews, and the
assemblies of the heathen, and the indictments by tribunes, and the
hearing of causes by kings, and the judgment-seats of proconsuls and the
name of Cæsar, do not need an interpreter. That Peter is struck, <span
id="fr_8323"></span>[8324](#fn_8323.md) that Stephen is overwhelmed *by
stones*, <span id="fr_8324"></span>[8325](#fn_8324.md) that James is
slain <span id="fr_8325"></span>[8326](#fn_8325.md) as is a victim at the
altar, that Paul is beheaded has been written in their own blood. And if
a heretic wishes his confidence to rest upon a public record, the
archives of the empire will speak, as would the stones of Jerusalem. We
read the lives of the Cæsars: At Rome Nero was the first who stained
with blood the rising faith. Then is Peter girt by another, <span
id="fr_8326"></span>[8327](#fn_8326.md) when he is made fast to the cross.
Then does Paul obtain a birth suited to Roman citizenship, when in Rome
he springs to life again ennobled by martyrdom.  Wherever I read of
these occurrences, so soon as I do so, I learn to suffer; nor does it
signify to me which I follow as teachers of martyrdom, whether the
declarations or the deaths of the apostles, save that in their deaths I
recall their declarations also.  For they would not have suffered ought
of a kind they had not previously known they had to suffer. When Agabus,
making use of corresponding action too, had foretold that bonds awaited
Paul, the disciples, weeping and entreating that he would not venture
upon going to Jerusalem, entreated in vain. <span
id="fr_8327"></span>[8328](#fn_8327.md) As for him, having a mind to
illustrate what he had always taught, he says, “Why weep ye, and grieve
my heart? But for my part, I could wish not only to suffer bonds, but
also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of my Lord Jesus Christ.” And so
they yielded by saying, “Let the will of the Lord be done;” feeling
sure, doubtless, that sufferings are included in the will of God. For
they had tried to keep him back with the intention not of dissuading,
but to show love for him; as yearning for (the preservation of) the
apostle, not as counselling against martyrdom. And if even then a
Prodicus or Valentinus stood by, suggesting that one must not confess on
the earth before men, and must do so the less in truth, that God may not
(seem to) thirst for blood, and Christ for a repayment of suffering, as
though He besought it with the view of obtaining salvation by it for
Himself also, he would have immediately heard from the servant of God
what the devil had from the Lord: “Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art
an offence unto me. It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
and Him only shalt thou serve.” <span
id="fr_8328"></span>[8329](#fn_8328.md) But even now it will be right that
he hear it, seeing that, long after, he has poured forth these poisons,
which not even thus are to injure readily any of the weak ones, if any
one in faith will drink, before being hurt, or even immediately after,
this draught of ours.
