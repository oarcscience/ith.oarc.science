<span id="vi.ii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Final Considerations to Induce
to Exomologesis.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.xii-p2"></span>If you shrink back from *<span
class="c42"><span id="vi.ii.xii-p2.1"></span>exomologesis</span>*,
consider in your heart the hell, <span
id="fr_8524"></span>[8525](#fn_8524.md) which *<span class="c42"><span
id="vi.ii.xii-p3.1"></span>exomologesis</span>* will extinguish for you;
and imagine first the magnitude of the penalty, that you may not
hesitate about the adoption of the remedy. What do we esteem that
treasure-house of eternal fire to be, when small vent-holes <span
id="fr_8525"></span>[8526](#fn_8525.md) of it rouse such blasts of flames
that neighbouring cities either are already no more, or are in daily
expectation of the same fate? The haughtiest <span
id="fr_8526"></span>[8527](#fn_8526.md) mountains start asunder in the
birth-throes of their inly-gendered fire; and—which proves to us the
*perpetuity* of the judgment—though they start asunder, though they be
devoured, yet come they never to an end. Who will not account these
occasional punishments inflicted on the mountains as examples of the
judgment which menaces the impenitent?  Who will not agree that such
sparks are but some few missiles and sportive darts of some inestimably
vast centre of fire? Therefore, since you know that after the first
bulwarks of the Lord’s baptism <span
id="fr_8527"></span>[8528](#fn_8527.md) there still remains for you, in
*<span class="c42"><span id="vi.ii.xii-p6.1"></span>exomologesis</span>*
a second reserve of aid against hell, why do you desert your own
salvation? Why are you tardy to approach what you know heals you?  Even
dumb irrational animals recognise in their time of need the medicines
which have been divinely assigned them. The stag, transfixed by the
arrow, knows that, to force out the steel, and its inextricable
lingerings, he must heal himself with dittany. The swallow, if she
blinds her young, knows how to give them eyes again by means of her own
swallow-wort. <span id="fr_8528"></span>[8529](#fn_8528.md) Shall the
sinner, knowing that *<span class="c42"><span
id="vi.ii.xii-p7.1"></span>exomologesis</span>* has been instituted by
the Lord for his restoration, pass that by which restored the Babylonian
king <span id="fr_8529"></span>[8530](#fn_8529.md) to his realms? Long time
had he offered to the Lord his repentance, working out his *<span
class="c42"><span id="vi.ii.xii-p8.2"></span>exomologesis</span>* by a
seven years’ squalor, with his nails wildly growing after the eagle’s
fashion, and his unkempt hair wearing the shagginess of a lion. Hard
handling! Him whom men were shuddering at, God was receiving back. But,
on the other hand, the Egyptian emperor—who, after pur<span
id="page_666">p. 666</span> <span id="vi.ii.xii-Page_666"></span>suing
the once afflicted people of God, long denied to their Lord, rushed into
the battle <span id="fr_8530"></span>[8531](#fn_8530.md) —did, after so
many warning plagues, perish in the parted sea, (which was permitted to
be passable to “the People” alone,) by the backward roll of the
waves: <span id="fr_8531"></span>[8532](#fn_8531.md) for repentance and her
handmaid <span id="fr_8532"></span>[8533](#fn_8532.md) *<span
class="c42"><span id="vi.ii.xii-p11.1"></span>exomologesis</span>* he
had cast away.

<span id="vi.ii.xii-p12"></span>Why should I add more touching these two
planks <span id="fr_8533"></span>[8534](#fn_8533) (as it were.md) of human
salvation, caring more for the business of the pen <span
id="fr_8534"></span>[8535](#fn_8534.md) than the duty of my conscience?
For, sinner as I am of every dye, <span
id="fr_8535"></span>[8536](#fn_8535.md) and born for nothing save
repentance, I cannot easily be silent about that concerning which also
the very head and fount of the human race, and of human offence, Adam,
restored by *<span class="c42"><span
id="vi.ii.xii-p15.1"></span>exomologesis</span>* to his own
paradise, <span id="fr_8536"></span>[8537](#fn_8536.md) is not silent.
