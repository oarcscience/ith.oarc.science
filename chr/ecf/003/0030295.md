<span id="v.iii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—The Truth Not Indebted to the
Care of the Heretics; It Had Free Course Before They Appeared. Priority
of the Church’s Doctrine a Mark of Its Truth.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxix-p2"></span>In whatever manner error came, it
reigned of course <span id="fr_2149"></span>[2150](#fn_2149.md) only as
long as there was an absence of heresies? Truth had to wait for certain
Marcionites and Valentinians to set it free. During the interval the
gospel was wrongly <span id="fr_2150"></span>[2151](#fn_2150.md) preached;
men wrongly believed; so many thousands were wrongly baptized; so many
works of faith were wrongly wrought; so many miraculous gifts, <span
id="fr_2151"></span>[2152](#fn_2151.md) so many spiritual endowments, <span
id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152.md) were wrongly set in operation; so
many priestly functions, so many ministries, <span
id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153.md) were wrongly executed; and, to sum
up the whole, so many martyrs wrongly received their crowns! Else, if
not wrongly done, and to no purpose, how comes it to pass that the
things of God were on their course before it was known to what God they
belonged? that there were Christians before Christ was found? that there
were heresies before true doctrine? Not so; for in all cases truth
precedes its copy, the likeness succeeds the reality. Absurd enough,
however, is it, that heresy should be deemed to have preceded its own
prior doctrine, even on this account, because it is that (doctrine)
itself which foretold that there <span id="page_257">p. 257</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxix-Page_257"></span>should be heresies against which men
would have to guard! To a church which possessed this doctrine, it was
written—yea, the doctrine itself writes to its own church—“Though an
angel from heaven preach any other gospel than that which we have
preached, let him be accursed.” <span

\[In this chapter (xxix.) the principle of *Prescription* is condensed
and brought to the needle-point—*Quod semper*. If you can’t show that
your doctrine was *always* taught, it is false: and this is
“Prescription.”\]
