<span id="v.vi.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The First Eight Emanations, or
Æons, Called the Ogdoad, are the Fountain of All the Others. Their Names
and Descent Recorded.</span>

<span id="v.vi.vii-p2"></span>Beginning with Ennius, <span
id="fr_6679"></span>[6680](#fn_6679.md) the Roman poet, he simply spoke of
“the spacious saloons <span id="fr_6680"></span>[6681](#fn_6680.md) of
heaven,”—either on account of their elevated site, or because in Homer
he had read about Jupiter banqueting therein.  As for *our* heretics,
however, it is marvellous what storeys upon storeys <span
id="fr_6681"></span>[6682](#fn_6681.md) and what heights upon heights, they
have hung up, raised *and* spread out as a dwelling for each several god
of theirs. Even our Creator has had arranged for Him the saloons of
Ennius in the fashion of private rooms, <span
id="fr_6682"></span>[6683](#fn_6682.md) with chamber piled upon chamber,
and assigned to each god by just as many staircases as there were
heresies. The universe, *in fact*, has been turned into “rooms to
let.” <span id="fr_6683"></span>[6684](#fn_6683.md) Such storeys of the
heavens you would imagine to be detached tenements in some happy isle of
the blessed, <span id="fr_6684"></span>[6685](#fn_6684.md) I know not
where. There the god even of the Valentinians has his dwelling in the
attics. They call him indeed, as to his essence, <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.vi.vii-p8.1"></span>Αἰῶν τέλειος</span>
(*Perfect Æon*), but in respect of his personality, <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.vi.vii-p8.2"></span>Προαρχή</span> (*Before
the Beginning*), <span class="Greek"><span id="v.vi.vii-p8.3"></span>῾Η
᾽Αρχή</span> (*The Beginning*), and sometimes Bythos (*Depth*), <span
id="fr_6685"></span>[6686](#fn_6685.md) a name <span id="page_507">p.
507</span> <span id="v.vi.vii-Page_507"></span>which is most unfit for
one who dwells in the heights above! They describe him as unbegotten,
immense, infinite, invisible, and eternal; as if, when they described
him to be such as we know that he ought to be, they straightway prove
him to be a being who may be said to have had such an existence even
before all things else. I indeed insist upon <span
id="fr_6686"></span>[6687](#fn_6686.md) it that he is such a being; and
there is nothing which I detect in beings of this sort more obvious,
than that they who are said to have been before all things—things, too,
not their own—are found to be behind all things. Let it, however, be
granted that this Bythos of theirs existed in the infinite ages of the
past in the greatest and profoundest repose, in the extreme rest of a
placid and, if I may use the expression, stupid divinity, such as
Epicurus has enjoined upon us. And yet, although they would have him be
alone, they assign to him a second person in himself and with himself,
Ennoea (*Thought*), which they also call both Charis (*Grace*) and Sige
(*Silence*). Other things, as it happened, conduced in this most
agreeable repose to remind him of the need of by and by producing out of
himself the beginning of all things.  This he deposits in lieu of seed
in the genital region, as it were, of the womb of his Sige.
Instantaneous conception is the result: Sige becomes pregnant, and is
delivered, of course in silence; and her offspring is Nus (Mind), very
like his father and his equal in every respect. In short, he alone is
capable of comprehending the measureless and incomprehensible greatness
of his father. Accordingly he is even called the Father himself, and the
Beginning of all things, and, with great propriety, Monogenes (*The
Only-begotten*). And yet not with absolute propriety, since he is not
born alone. For along with him a female also proceeded, whose name was
Veritas <span id="fr_6687"></span>[6688](#fn_6687) (*Truth*.md). But how
much more suitably might Monogenes be called Protogenes (*First
begotten*), since he was begotten first! Thus Bythos and Sige, Nus and
Veritas, are alleged to be the first fourfold team <span
id="fr_6688"></span>[6689](#fn_6688.md) of the Valentinian set (of
gods) <span id="fr_6689"></span>[6690](#fn_6689.md) the parent stock and
origin of them all.  For immediately when <span
id="fr_6690"></span>[6691](#fn_6690.md) Nus received the function of a
procreation of his own, he too produces out of himself Sermo (*the
Word*) and Vita (*the Life*). If this latter existed not previously, of
course she existed not in Bythos. And a pretty absurdity would it be, if
*Life* existed not in God! However, this offspring also produces fruit,
having for its mission the initiation of the universe and the formation
of the entire Pleroma: it procreates Homo (*Man*) and Ecclesia (*the
Church*). Thus you have an Ogdoad, a double Tetra, out of the
conjunctions of males and females—the cells <span
id="fr_6691"></span>[6692](#fn_6691) (so to speak.md) of the primordial
Æons, the fraternal nuptials of the Valentinian gods, the simple
originals <span id="fr_6692"></span>[6693](#fn_6692.md) of heretical
sanctity and majesty, a rabble <span
id="fr_6693"></span>[6694](#fn_6693.md) —shall I say of criminals <span
id="fr_6694"></span>[6695](#fn_6694.md) or of deities? <span
id="fr_6695"></span>[6696](#fn_6695.md) —at any rate, the fountain of all
ulterior fecundity.

<span id="v.vi.vii-p8"></span> This is perhaps a fair rendering of
“Insulam Feliculam credas tanta tabulata cœlorum, nescio ubi.” “Insula”
is sometimes “a detached house.” It is difficult to say what “Felicula”
is; it seems to be a diminutive of Felix. It occurs in Arrian’s
*Epictetica* as the name of a slave.
