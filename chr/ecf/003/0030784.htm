<p class="c30"><a name="vi.vi.iii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.vi.iii-p1.1"></A>Chapter I.&#8212;Argument.&#8212;When the Saints Were Apprehended, St. Perpetua Successfully Resisted Her Father&#146;s Pleading, Was Baptized with the Others, Was Thrust into a Filthy Dungeon. Anxious About Her Infant, by a Vision Granted to Her, She Understood that Her Martyrdom Would Take Place Very Shortly.</span></p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="vi.vi.iii-p2"></A>1. The young catechumens, Revocatus and his fellow-servant Felicitas, Saturninus and Secundulus, were apprehended. And among them also was Vivia Perpetua, respectably born, liberally educated, a married matron, having a father and mother and two brothers, one of whom, like herself, was a catechumen, and a son an infant at the breast. She herself was about twenty-two years of age. From this point onward she shall herself narrate the whole course of her martyrdom, as she left it described by her own hand and with her own mind.</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="vi.vi.iii-p3"></A>2. &#8220;While&#8221; says she, &#8220;we were still with the persecutors, and my father, for the sake of his affection for me, was persisting in seeking to turn me away, and to cast me down from the faith,&#8212;&#145;Father,&#146; said I, &#145;do you see, let us say, this vessel lying here to be a little pitcher, or something else?&#146; And he said, &#145;I see it to be so.&#146; And I replied to him, &#145;Can it be called by any other name than what it <A NAME="page_700"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 700</FONT></A> <a name="vi.vi.iii-Page_700"></A>is?&#146;&#160; And he said, &#145;No.&#146; &#145;Neither can I call myself anything else than what I am, a Christian.&#146; Then my father, provoked at this saying, threw himself upon me, as if he would tear my eyes out. But he only distressed me, and went away overcome by the devil&#146;s arguments. Then, in a few days after I had been without my father, I gave thanks to the Lord; and his absence became a source of consolation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8977"></A><A HREF="#fn_8977"><FONT SIZE="1">8978</FONT></A>
 to me. In that same interval of a few days we were baptized, and to me the Spirit prescribed that in the water <i>of baptism</i> nothing else was to be sought for bodily endurance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8978"></A><A HREF="#fn_8978"><FONT SIZE="1">8979</FONT></A>
 After a few days we are taken into the dungeon, and I was very much afraid, because I had never felt such darkness. O terrible day! O the fierce heat of the shock of the soldiery, because of the crowds! I was very unusually distressed by my anxiety for my infant. There were present there Tertius and Pomponius, the blessed deacons who ministered to us, and had arranged by means of a gratuity that we might be refreshed by being sent out for a few hours into a pleasanter part of the prison. Then going out of the dungeon, all attended to their own wants.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8979"></A><A HREF="#fn_8979"><FONT SIZE="1">8980</FONT></A>
 I suckled my child, which was now enfeebled with hunger. In my anxiety for it, I addressed my mother and comforted my brother, and commended to their care my son. I was languishing because I had seen them languishing on my account.&#160; Such solicitude I suffered for many days, and I obtained for my infant to remain in the dungeon with me; and forthwith I grew strong and was relieved from distress and anxiety about my infant; and the dungeon became to me as it were a palace, so that I preferred being there to being elsewhere.</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="vi.vi.iii-p7"></A>3. &#8220;Then my brother said to me, &#145;My dear sister, you are already in a position of great dignity, and are such that you may ask for a vision, and that it may be made known to you whether this is to result in a passion or an escape.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8980"></A><A HREF="#fn_8980"><FONT SIZE="1">8981</FONT></A>
 And I, who knew that I was privileged to converse with the Lord, whose kindnesses I had found to be so great, boldly promised him, and said, &#145;To-morrow I will tell you.&#146; And I asked, and this was what was shown me. I saw a golden ladder of marvellous height, reaching up even to heaven, and very narrow, so that persons could only ascend it one by one; and on the sides of the ladder was fixed every kind of iron weapon. There were there swords, lances, hooks, daggers; so that if any one went up carelessly, or not looking upwards, he would be torn to pieces and his flesh would cleave to the iron weapons. And under the ladder itself was crouching a dragon of wonderful size, who lay in wait for those who ascended, and frightened them from the ascent. And Saturus went up first, who had subsequently delivered himself up freely on our account, not having been present at the time that we were taken prisoners. And he attained the top of the ladder, and turned towards me, and said to me, &#145;Perpetua, I am waiting for&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8981"></A><A HREF="#fn_8981"><FONT SIZE="1">8982</FONT></A>
 you; but be careful that the dragon do not bite you.&#146; And I said, &#145;In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, he shall not hurt me.&#146; And from under the ladder itself, as if in fear of me, he slowly lifted up his head; and as I trod upon the first step, I trod upon his head. And I went up, and I saw an immense extent of garden, and in the midst of the garden a white-haired man sitting in the dress of a shepherd,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8982"></A><A HREF="#fn_8982"><FONT SIZE="1">8983</FONT></A>
 of a large stature, milking sheep; and standing around were many thousand white-robed ones. And he raised his head, and looked upon me, and said to me, &#145;Thou art welcome, daughter.&#146; And he called me, and from the cheese as he was milking he gave me as it were a little cake, and I received it with folded hands; and I ate it, and all who stood around said Amen. And at the sound of their voices I was awakened, still tasting a sweetness which I cannot describe. And I immediately related this to my brother, and we understood that it was to be a passion, and we ceased henceforth to have any hope in this world.</p>
