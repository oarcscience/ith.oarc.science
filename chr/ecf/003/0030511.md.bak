<span id="v.v.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—Further Exposure of
Inconsistencies in the Opinions of Hermogenes Respecting the Divine
Qualities of Matter.</span>

<span id="v.v.xlii-p2"></span>You have thrown out all your views loosely
and at random, <span id="fr_6574"></span>[6575](#fn_6574.md) in order that
it might not be apparent, by too close a proximity, how contrary they
are to one another. I, however, mean to gather them together and compare
them.  You allege that motion in Matter is <span id="page_501">p.
501</span> <span id="v.v.xlii-Page_501"></span>without regularity, <span
id="fr_6575"></span>[6576](#fn_6575.md) and you go on to say that Matter
aims at a shapeless condition, and then, in another passage, that it
desires to be set in order by God. Does that, then, which affects to be
without form, want to be put into shape? Or does that which wants to be
put into shape, affect to be without form? You are unwilling that God
should seem to be equal to Matter; and then again you say that it has a
common condition <span id="fr_6576"></span>[6577](#fn_6576.md) with God.
“For it is impossible,” you say, “if it has nothing in common with God,
that it can be set in order by Him.” But if it had anything in common
with God, it did not want to be set in order, <span
id="fr_6577"></span>[6578](#fn_6577.md) being, forsooth, a part of the
Deity through a community of condition; or else even God was susceptible
of being set in order <span id="fr_6578"></span>[6579](#fn_6578.md) by
Matter, by His having Himself something in common with it. And now you
herein subject God to necessity, since there was in Matter something on
account of which He gave it form. You make it, however, a common
attribute of both of them, that they set themselves in motion by
themselves, and that they are ever in motion. What less do you ascribe
to Matter than to God? There will be found all through a fellowship of
divinity in this freedom and perpetuity of motion.

<span id="v.v.xlii-p8"></span>Only in God motion is regular, <span
id="fr_6579"></span>[6580](#fn_6579.md) in Matter irregular. <span
id="fr_6580"></span>[6581](#fn_6580.md) In both, however, there is equally
the attribute of Deity—both alike having free and eternal motion. At the
same time, you assign more to Matter, to which belonged the privilege of
thus moving itself in a way not allowed to God.
