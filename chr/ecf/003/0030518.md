<span id="v.vi.iii"></span>

<span id="v.vi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Folly of This Heresy. It
Dissects and Mutilates the Deity. Contrasted with the Simple Wisdom of
True Religion. To Expose the Absurdities of the Valentinian System is to
Destroy It.</span>

<span id="v.vi.iii-p2"></span>Let, then, the serpent hide himself as
much as he is able, and let him wrest <span
id="fr_6641"></span>[6642](#fn_6641.md) all his wisdom in the labyrinths of
his obscurities; let him dwell deep down in the ground; let him worm
himself into secret holes; let him unroll his length through his sinuous
joints; <span id="fr_6642"></span>[6643](#fn_6642.md) let him tortuously
crawl, though not all at once, <span
id="fr_6643"></span>[6644](#fn_6643.md) beast as he is that skulks the
light. Of our dove, however, how simple is the very home!—always in high
and open places, and facing the light! As the symbol of the Holy Spirit,
it loves the (radiant) East, that figure of Christ. <span
id="fr_6644"></span>[6645](#fn_6644.md) Nothing causes truth a blush,
except only being hidden, because no man will be ashamed to give ear
thereto. *No man will be ashamed* to recognise Him as God whom nature
has already commended to him, whom he already perceives in all His
works, <span id="fr_6645"></span>[6646](#fn_6645.md) —Him indeed who is
simply, for this reason, imperfectly known; because man has not thought
of Him as only one, because he has named Him in a plurality (of gods),
and adored Him in other *forms*. Yet, <span
id="fr_6646"></span>[6647](#fn_6646.md) to induce oneself to turn from this
multitude of deities to another crowd, <span
id="fr_6647"></span>[6648](#fn_6647.md) to remove from a familiar authority
to an unknown one, to wrench oneself from what is manifest to what is
hidden, is to offend faith on the very threshold. Now, even suppose that
you are initiated into the entire fable, will it not occur to you that
you have heard something very like it from your fond nurse <span
id="fr_6648"></span>[6649](#fn_6648.md) when you were a baby, amongst <span
id="page_505">p. 505</span> <span id="v.vi.iii-Page_505"></span>the
lullabies she sang to you <span id="fr_6649"></span>[6650](#fn_6649.md)
about the towers of Lamia, and the horns of the sun? <span
id="fr_6650"></span>[6651](#fn_6650.md) Let, however, any man approach the
subject from a knowledge of the faith which he has otherwise learned, as
soon as he finds so many names of Æons, so many marriages, so many
offsprings, so many exits, so many issues, felicities *and* infelicities
of a dispersed and mutilated Deity, will that man hesitate at once to
pronounce that these are “the fables and endless genealogies” which the
inspired apostle <span id="fr_6651"></span>[6652](#fn_6651.md) by
anticipation condemned, whilst these seeds of heresy were even then
shooting forth? Deservedly, therefore, must they be regarded as wanting
in simplicity, and as merely prudent, who produce such fables not
without difficulty, and defend them only indirectly, who at the same
time do not thoroughly instruct those whom they teach. This, of course,
shows their astuteness, if their lessons are disgraceful; their
unkindness, if they are honourable. As for us, however, who are the
simple folk, we know all about it. In short, this is the very first
weapon with which we are armed for our encounter; it unmasks <span
id="fr_6652"></span>[6653](#fn_6652.md) and brings to view <span
id="fr_6653"></span>[6654](#fn_6653.md) the whole of their depraved
system. <span id="fr_6654"></span>[6655](#fn_6654.md) And in this we have
the first augury of our victory; because even merely to point out that
which is concealed with so great an outlay of artifice, <span
id="fr_6655"></span>[6656](#fn_6655.md) is to destroy it.

Tertullian read sundry passages in his Latin Bible similarly to the

whose name is the <span class="sc"><span

“Ecce Vir *Oriens* nomen ejus.” Similarly in [Zech. iii.

“Servum meum adducam <span class="sc"><span

where the <span class="Greek"><span id="v.vi.iii-p6.10"></span>᾽Ανατολὴ

“*Oriens* ex alto.”)
