<span id="v.iv.iii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The Severity of God Compatible
with Reason and Justice. When Inflicted, Not Meant to Be Arbitrary, But
Remedial.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xv-p2"></span>Consider well, <span
id="fr_2872"></span>[2873](#fn_2872) then, before all things the justice
of the Judge; and if its purpose <span
id="fr_2873"></span>[2874](#fn_2873) be clear, then the severity
thereof, and the operations of the severity in its course, will appear
compatible with reason and justice. Now, that we may not linger too long
on the point, (I would challenge you to) assert the other reasons also,
that you may condemn *the Judge’s* sentences; extenuate the
delinquencies of the sinner, that you may blame his judicial conviction.
Never mind censuring the Judge; rather prove Him to be an unjust one. 
Well, then, even though <span id="fr_2874"></span>[2875](#fn_2874) He
required the sins of the fathers at the hands of the children, the
hardness of the people made such remedial measures necessary <span
id="fr_2875"></span>[2876](#fn_2875) for them, in order that, having
their posterity in view, they might obey the divine law. For who is
there that feels not a greater care for his children than for himself?
Again, if the blessing of the fathers was destined likewise for their
offspring, previous to <span id="fr_2876"></span>[2877](#fn_2876) any
merit on the part of these, why might not the guilt of the fathers also
redound to their children? As was the grace, so was the offence; so that
the grace and the offence equally ran down through the whole race, with
the reservation, indeed, of that subsequent ordinance by which it became
possible to refrain from saying, that “the fathers had eaten a sour
grape, and the children’s teeth were set on edge:” <span
id="fr_2877"></span>[2878](#fn_2877) in other words, that the father
should not bear the iniquity of the son, nor the son the iniquity of the
father, but that every man should be chargeable with his own sin; so
that the harshness of the law having been reduced <span
id="fr_2878"></span>[2879](#fn_2878) after the hardness of the people,
justice was no longer to judge *the race*, but individuals. If, however,
you accept the gospel of truth, you will discover on whom recoils the
sentence of the Judge, when requiting on sons the sins of their fathers,
even on those who had been (hardened enough) to imprecate spontaneously
on themselves this condemnation: “His blood be on us, and on our
children.” <span id="fr_2879"></span>[2880](#fn_2879) *This*, therefore,
the providence of God has ordered throughout its course, <span
id="fr_2880"></span>[2881](#fn_2880) even as it had heard it.
