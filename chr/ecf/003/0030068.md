<span id="iv.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Of Schoolmasters and Their
Difficulties.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.x-p2"></span>Moreover, we must inquire likewise touching
schoolmasters; nor only of them, but also all other professors of
literature. Nay, on the contrary, we must not doubt that they are in
affinity with manifold idolatry: *first*, in that it is necessary for
them to preach the gods of the nations, to express their names,
genealogies, honourable distinctions, all and singular; and *further*,
to observe the solemnities and festivals of the same, as of them by
whose means they compute their revenues. What schoolmaster, without a
table of the seven idols, <span id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) will
yet frequent the Quinquatria? The very first payment of every pupil he
consecrates both to the honour and to the name of Minerva; so that, even
though he be not said “to eat of that which is sacrificed to
idols” <span id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) *nominally* (not being
dedicated to any particular idol), he is shunned as an idolater.  What
less of defilement does he recur on that ground, <span
id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) than a business brings which, both
nominally and virtually, is consecrated publicly to an idol? The
Minervalia are as much Minerva’s, as the Saturnalia Saturn’s; Saturn’s,
which must necessarily be celebrated even by little slaves at the time
of the Saturnalia. New-year’s gifts likewise must be caught at, and the
Septimontium kept; and all the presents of Midwinter and the feast of
Dear Kinsmanship must be exacted; the schools must be wreathed with
flowers; the flamens’ wives and the ædiles sacrifice; the school is
honoured on the appointed holy-days. The same thing takes place on an
idol’s birthday; every pomp of the devil is frequented. Who will think
that these things are befitting to a Christian master, <span
id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) unless *it be he* who shall think them
suitable likewise to one who is not a master?  We know it may be said,
“If teaching literature is not lawful to God’s servants, neither will
learning be likewise;” and, “How could one be trained unto ordinary
human intelligence, or unto any sense or action whatever, since
literature is the means of training for all life? How do we repudiate
secular studies, without which divine studies cannot be pursued?”  Let
us see, then, the necessity of literary erudition; let us reflect that
partly it cannot be admitted, partly cannot be avoided. Learning
literature is allowable for believers, rather than teaching; for the
principle of learning and of teaching is different. If a believer teach
literature, while he is teaching doubtless he commends, while he
delivers he affirms, while he recalls he bears testimony to, the praises
of idols interspersed <span id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span
id="iv.iv.x-Page_67"></span>therein. He seals the gods themselves with
this name; <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) whereas the Law, as
we have said, prohibits “the names of gods to be pronounced,” <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) and this name <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) to be conferred on vanity. <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) Hence the devil gets men’s early faith
built up from the beginnings of their erudition.  Inquire whether he who
catechizes about idols commit idolatry. But when a believer *learns*
these things, if he is already capable of understanding what idolatry
is, he neither receives nor allows them; much more if he is not yet
capable. Or, when he *begins* to understand, it behoves him first to
understand what he has previously learned, that is, touching God and the
faith. Therefore he will reject those things, and will not receive them;
and will be as safe as one who from one who knows it not, knowingly
*accepts* poison, but does not *drink* it. To *him* necessity is
attributed as an excuse, because he has no other way to learn. Moreover,
the not *teaching* literature is as much easier than the not *learning*,
as it is easier, too, for the pupil not to attend, than for the master
not to frequent, the rest of the defilements incident to the schools
from public and scholastic solemnities.
