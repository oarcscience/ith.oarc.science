<span id="iv.v.ix-p2"></span>Now as to the kind of performances peculiar
to the circus exhibitions. In former days equestrianism was practised in
a simple way on horseback, and certainly its ordinary use had nothing
sinful in it; but when it was dragged into the games, it passed from the
service of God into the employment of demons.  Accordingly this kind of
circus performances is regarded as sacred to Castor and Pollux, to whom,
Stesichorus tells us, horses were given by Mercury. And Neptune, too, is
an equestrian deity, by the Greeks called Hippius.  In regard to the
team, they have consecrated the chariot and four to the sun; the chariot
and pair to the moon.  But, as the poet has it, “Erichthonius first
dared to yoke four horses to the chariot, and to ride upon its wheels
with victorious swiftness.” Erichthonius, the son of Vulcan and Minerva,
fruit of unworthy passion upon earth, is a demon-monster, nay, the devil
himself, and no mere snake. But if Trochilus the Argive is maker of the
first chariot, he dedicated that work of his to Juno. If Romulus first
exhibited the four-horse chariot at Rome, he too, I think, has a place
given him among idols, at least if he and Quirinus are the same. But as
chariots had such inventors, the charioteers were naturally dressed,
too, in the colours of idolatry; for at first these were only two,
namely white and red,—the former sacred to the winter with its
glistening snows, the latter sacred to the summer with its ruddy sun:
but afterwards, in the progress of luxury as well as of superstition,
red was dedicated by some to Mars, and white by others to the Zephyrs,
while green was given to Mother Earth, or spring, and azure to the sky
and sea, or autumn. But as idolatry of every kind is condemned by God,
that form of it surely shares the condemnation which is offered to the
elements of nature.
