<span id="iv.viii.ii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The Changes of the Heavenly
Bodies, Proof that They are Not Divine.  Transition from the Physical to
the Mythic Class of Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.vi-p2"></span>Come now, do you allow that the
Divine Being not only has nothing servile in His course, but exists in
unimpaired integrity, and ought not to be diminished, or suspended, or
destroyed? Well, then, all His blessedness <span
id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871) would disappear, if He were ever
subject to change. Look, however, at the stellar bodies; they both
undergo change, and give clear evidence of the fact. The moon tells us
how great has been its loss, as it recovers its full form; <span
id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872) its greater losses you are already
accustomed to measure in a mirror of water; <span
id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873) so that I need not any longer believe
in any wise what magians have asserted. The sun, too, is frequently put
to the trial of an eclipse. Explain as best you may the modes of these
celestial casualties, it is impossible <span
id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874) for God <span id="page_135">p.
135</span> <span id="iv.viii.ii.vi-Page_135"></span>either to become
less or to cease to exist. Vain, therefore, are <span
id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875) those supports of human learning,
which, by their artful method of weaving conjectures, belie both wisdom
and truth.  Besides, <span id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876) it so
happens, indeed, according to your natural way of thinking, that he who
has spoken the best is supposed to have spoken most truly, instead of
him who has spoken the truth being held to have spoken the best. Now the
man who shall carefully look into things, will surely allow it to be a
greater probability that those <span id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877)
elements which we have been discussing are under some rule and
direction, than that they have a motion of their own, and that being
under government they cannot be gods. If, however, one is in error in
this matter, it is better to err simply than speculatively, like your
physical philosophers. But, at the same time, <span
id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878) if you consider the character of the
*mythic* school, (and compare it with the *physical*,) the error which
we have already seen frail men <span id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879)
making in the latter is really the more respectable one, since it
ascribes a divine nature to those things which it supposes to be
*superhuman* in their sensibility, whether in respect of their position,
their power, their magnitude, or their divinity. For that which you
suppose to be higher than man, you believe to be very near to God.
