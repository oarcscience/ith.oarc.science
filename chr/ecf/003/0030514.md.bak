<span id="v.v.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV.—Conclusion. Contrast Between the
Statements of Hermogenes and the Testimony of Holy Scripture Respecting
the Creation. Creation Out of Nothing, Not Out of Matter.</span>

<span id="v.v.xlv-p2"></span>But it is not thus that the prophets and
the apostles have told us that the world was made by God merely
appearing and approaching Matter. They did not even mention any Matter,
but (said) that Wisdom was first set up, the beginning of His ways, for
His works. <span id="fr_6592"></span>[6593](#fn_6592.md) Then that the Word
was produced, “through whom all things were made, and without whom
nothing was made.” <span id="fr_6593"></span>[6594](#fn_6593.md) Indeed,
“by the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all their hosts by
the breath of His mouth.” <span id="fr_6594"></span>[6595](#fn_6594.md) He
is the Lord’s right hand, <span id="fr_6595"></span>[6596](#fn_6595.md)
indeed His two hands, by which He worked and constructed *the universe*.
“For,” says He, “the heavens are the works of Thine hands,” <span
id="fr_6596"></span>[6597](#fn_6596.md) wherewith “He hath meted out the
heaven, and the earth with a span.” <span
id="fr_6597"></span>[6598](#fn_6597.md) Do not be willing so to cover God
with flattery, as to contend that He produced by His mere appearance and
simple approach so many vast substances, instead of rather forming them
by His own energies. For this is proved by Jeremiah when he says, “God
hath made the earth by His power, He hath established the world by His
wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by His understanding.” <span
id="fr_6598"></span>[6599](#fn_6598.md) These are the energies by the
stress of which He made this universe. <span
id="fr_6599"></span>[6600](#fn_6599.md) His glory is greater if He
laboured. At length on the seventh day He rested from His works. Both
one and the other were after His manner. If, on the contrary, <span
id="fr_6600"></span>[6601](#fn_6600.md) He made this world simply by
appearing and approaching it, did He, on the completion of His work,
cease to appear and approach it any more. Nay rather, <span
id="fr_6601"></span>[6602](#fn_6601.md) God began to appear more
conspicuously and to be everywhere accessible <span
id="fr_6602"></span>[6603](#fn_6602.md) from the time when the world was
made.  You see, therefore, how all things consist by the operation of
that God who “made the earth by His power, who established the world by
His wisdom, and stretched out the heaven by His understanding;” not
appearing merely, nor approaching, but applying the almighty efforts of
His mind, His wisdom, His power, His understanding, His word, His
Spirit, His might. Now these things were not necessary to Him, if He had
been perfect by simply appearing and approaching. They are, however, His
“invisible things,” which, according to the apostle, “are from the
creation of the world clearly seen by the things that are made;” <span
id="fr_6603"></span>[6604](#fn_6603.md) *they are no parts* of a
nondescript <span id="fr_6604"></span>[6605](#fn_6604.md) Matter, but they
are the sensible <span id="fr_6605"></span>[6606](#fn_6605.md) evidences of
Himself. “For who hath known the mind of the Lord,” <span
id="fr_6606"></span>[6607](#fn_6606) of which (the apostle.md) exclaims: “O
the depth of the riches both of His wisdom and knowledge! how
unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!” <span
id="fr_6607"></span>[6608](#fn_6607.md) Now what clearer truth do these
words indicate, than that all things were made out of nothing? They are
incapable of being found out or investigated, except by God alone. 
Otherwise, if they were traceable or discoverable in Matter, they would
be capable of investigation. Therefore, in *as* far as it has become
evident that Matter had no prior existence (even from this circumstance,
that it is impossible <span id="fr_6608"></span>[6609](#fn_6608.md) for it
to have had such an existence as is assigned to it), in *so* far is it
proved that all things were made by God out of nothing. It must be
admitted, however, <span id="fr_6609"></span>[6610](#fn_6609.md) that
Hermogenes, by describing for Matter a condition like his own—irregular,
confused, turbulent, of a doubtful and precipate and fervid impulse—has
displayed a specimen of his own art, and painted his own portrait.
