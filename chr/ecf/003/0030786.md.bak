<span id="vi.vi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Argument. Perpetua is Again
Tempted by Her Father. Her Third Vision, Wherein She is Led Away to
Struggle Against an Egyptian. She Fights, Conquers, and Receives the
Reward.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.v-p2"></span>1. “Again, after a few days, Pudens, a
soldier, an assistant overseer <span
id="fr_8990"></span>[8991](#fn_8990.md) of the prison, who began to regard
us in great esteem, perceiving that the great power of God was in us,
admitted many brethren to see us, that both we and they might be
mutually refreshed.  And when the day of the exhibition drew near, my
father, worn with suffering, came in to me, and began to tear out his
beard, and to throw himself on the earth, and to cast himself down on
his face, and to reproach his years, and to utter such words as might
move all creation. I grieved for his unhappy old age. <span
id="fr_8991"></span>[8992](#fn_8991.md)

<span id="vi.vi.v-p5"></span>2. “The day before that on which we were to
fight, I saw in a vision that Pomponius the deacon came hither to the
gate of the prison, and knocked vehemently. I went out to him, and
opened the gate for him; and he was clothed in a richly ornamented white
robe, and he had on manifold calliculæ. <span
id="fr_8992"></span>[8993](#fn_8992.md) And he said to me, ‘Perpetua, we
are waiting for you; come!’ And he held his hand to me, and we began to
go through rough and winding places. Scarcely at length had we arrived
breathless at the amphitheatre, when he led me into the middle of the
arena, and said to me, ‘Do not fear, I am here with you, and I am
labouring with you;’ and he departed. And I gazed upon an immense
assembly in astonishment. And because I knew that I was given to the
wild beasts, I marvelled that the wild beasts were not let loose upon
me. Then there came forth against me a certain Egyptian, horrible in
appearance, with his backers, to fight with me. And there came to me, as
my helpers and encouragers, handsome youths; and I was stripped, and
became a man. <span id="fr_8993"></span>[8994](#fn_8993.md) Then my helpers
began to rub me with oil, as is the custom for contest; and I beheld
that Egyptian on the other hand rolling in the dust. <span
id="fr_8994"></span>[8995](#fn_8994.md) And a certain man came forth, of
wondrous height, so that he even over-topped the top of the
amphitheatre; and he wore a loose tunic and a purple robe between two
bands over the middle of the breast; and he had on *calliculæ* of varied
form, made of gold and silver; and he carried a rod, as if he were a
trainer of gladiators, and a green branch upon which were apples of
gold. And he called for silence, and said, ‘This Egyptian, if he should
overcome this woman, shall kill her with the sword; and if she shall
conquer him, she shall receive this branch.’ Then he departed. And we
drew near to one another, and began to deal out blows. He sought to lay
hold of my feet, while I struck at his face with my heels; and I was
lifted up in the air, and began thus to thrust at him as if spurning the
earth. But when I saw that there was some delay I joined my hands so as
to twine my fingers with one another; and I took hold upon his head, and
he fell on his face, and I trod upon his head. <span
id="fr_8995"></span>[8996](#fn_8995.md) And the people began to shout, and
my backers to exult. And I drew near to the trainer and took the branch;
and he kissed me, and said to me, ‘Daughter, peace be with you:’ and I
began to go gloriously to the Sanavivarian gate. <span
id="fr_8996"></span>[8997](#fn_8996.md) Then I awoke, and perceived that I
was not to fight with beasts, but against the devil.  Still I knew that
the victory was awaiting me. This, so far, I have completed several days
before the exhibition; but what passed at the exhibition itself let who
will write.”

<span id="vi.vi.v-p6"></span> It seems uncertain what may be the meaning
of this word. It is variously supposed to signify little round ornaments
either of cloth or metal attached to the soldier’s dress, or the small
bells on the priestly robe. Some also read the word *galliculæ*, small
sandals.
