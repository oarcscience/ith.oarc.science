<span id="iv.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Of the Observance of Days
Connected with Idolatry.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xiii-p2"></span>But why speak of sacrifices and
priesthoods? Of spectacles, moreover, and pleasures of that kind, we
have already filled a volume of their own. <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) In this place must be handled the
subject of holidays and other extraordinary solemnities, which we accord
sometimes to our wantonness, sometimes to our timidity, in opposition to
the common faith and Discipline. The first point, indeed, on which I
shall join issue is this:  whether a servant of God ought to share with
the very <span id="page_69">p. 69</span> <span
id="iv.iv.xiii-Page_69"></span>nations themselves in matters of his kind
either in dress, or in food, or in any other kind of their gladness. “To
rejoice with the rejoicing, and grieve with the grieving,” <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) is said about *brethren* by the
apostle when exhorting to unanimity. But, for *these* purposes, “There
is nought of communion between light and darkness,” <span
id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) between life and death or else we
rescind what is written, “The world shall rejoice, but ye shall
grieve.” <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) If we rejoice with the
world, there is reason to fear that with the world we shall grieve too.
But when the world rejoices, let us grieve; and when the world afterward
grieves, we shall rejoice. Thus, too, Eleazar <span
id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) in Hades, <span
id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) (attaining refreshment in Abraham’s
bosom) and the rich man, (on the other hand, set in the torment of fire)
compensate, by an answerable retribution, their alternate vicissitudes
of evil and good.  There are certain gift-days, which with some adjust
the claim of honour, with others the debt of wages. “Now, then,” you
say, “I shall receive back what is mine, or pay back what is another’s.”
If men have consecrated for themselves this custom from superstition,
why do you, estranged as you are from all their vanity, participate in
solemnities consecrated to idols; as if for you also there were some
prescript about a day, short of the observance of a particular day, to
prevent your paying or receiving what you owe a man, or what is owed you
by a man? Give me the form after which you wish to be dealt with.  For
why should you skulk withal, when you contaminate your own conscience by
your neighbour’s ignorance?  If you are not unknown to be a Christian,
you are tempted, and you act as if you were not a Christian against your
neighbour’s conscience; if, however, you shall be disguised
withal, <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) you are the slave of the
temptation. At all events, whether in the latter or the former way, you
are guilty of being “ashamed of God.” <span
id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) But “whosoever shall be ashamed of Me
in the presence of men, of him will I too be ashamed,” says He, “in the
presence of my Father who is in the heavens.” <span
id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md)

In the *De Spect*. xxvi. Tertullian has the same quotation (Oehler). And
there, too, he adds, as here, “between life and death.”

<span id="iv.iv.xiii-p6"></span> [John xvi.
20](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.iv.xiii-p6.1"></span>.
It is observable that Tertullian here translates <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.xiii-p6.2"></span>κόσμον</span> by
“seculum.”

<span id="fn_257"></span>[69:258](0030071.htm#fr_257.md) <span

<span id="iv.iv.xiii-p7"></span> i.e., Lazarus, [Luke xvi.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[69:259](0030071.htm#fr_258.md) <span
id="iv.iv.xiii-p7.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.xiii-p8"></span> “Apud inferos,” used clearly *here* by
Tertullian of a place of happiness. Augustine says he never finds it so
used in Scripture. See Ussher’s “Answer to a Jesuit” on the Article, “He
descended into hell.” \[See Elucid. X. p. 59, *supra*.\]

<span id="fn_259"></span>[69:260](0030071.htm#fr_259.md) <span
id="iv.iv.xiii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.xiii-p9"></span> i.e., if you *are* unknown to be a
Christian: “dissimulaberis.” This is Oehler’s reading; but Latinius and
Fr. Junis would read “Dissimulaveris,” ="if you dissemble the fact” of
being a Christian, which perhaps is better.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[69:261](0030071.htm#fr_260.md) <span
id="iv.iv.xiii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.xiii-p10"></span> So Mr. Dodgson renders very well.
