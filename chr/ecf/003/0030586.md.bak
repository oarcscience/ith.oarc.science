<span id="v.viii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Heathens and Heretics Alike in
Their Vilification of the Flesh and Its Functions, the Ordinary Cavils
Against the Final Restitution of So Weak and Ignoble a Substance.</span>

<span id="v.viii.iv-p2"></span>Hence it is that heretics start at once
from this point, <span id="fr_7310"></span>[7311](#fn_7310.md) from which
they sketch the first draft of their dogmas, and afterwards add the
details, being well aware how easily men’s minds are caught by its
influence, (and actuated) by that community of human sentiment which is
so favourable to their designs. Is there anything else that you can hear
of from the heretic, as *also* from the heathen, earlier in time or
greater in extent? Is not (their burden) from the beginning and
everywhere an invective against the flesh—against its origin, against
its substance, against the casualties and the invariable end which await
it; unclean from its first formation of the dregs of the ground,
uncleaner afterwards from the mire of its own seminal transmission;
worthless, <span id="fr_7311"></span>[7312](#fn_7311.md) weak, covered with
guilt, laden with misery, full of trouble; and after all this record of
its degradation, dropping into its original earth and the appellation of
a corpse, and destined to dwindle away even from this <span
id="fr_7312"></span>[7313](#fn_7312.md) loathsome name into none henceforth
at all—into the very death of all designation? Now you are a shrewd man,
no doubt: will you then persuade *yourself*, that after this flesh has
been withdrawn from sight, and touch, and memory, it can never be
rehabilitated from corruption to integrity, from a shattered to a solid
state, from an empty to a full condition, from nothing at all to
something—the devouring fires, and the waters of the sea, and the maws
of beasts, and the crops of birds and the stomachs of fishes, and time’s
own great paunch <span id="fr_7313"></span>[7314](#fn_7313.md) itself of
course yielding it all up again?  Shall the same flesh which has fallen
to decay be so expected to recover, as that the lame, and the one-eyed,
and the blind, and the leper, and the palsied shall come back again,
although there can be no pleasure in returning to their old condition?
Or shall they be whole, and so have to fear exposure to such sufferings?
What, in that case, (must we say) of the consequences of *resuming* the
flesh? Will it again be subject to all its present wants, especially
meats and drinks?  Shall we have with our lungs to float (in air or
water), <span id="fr_7314"></span>[7315](#fn_7314.md) and suffer pain in
our bowels, and with organs of shame to feel no shame, and with all our
limbs to toil and labour?  Must there again be ulcers, and wounds, and
fever, and gout, and once more the wishing to die? Of course these will
be the longings incident on the recovery of the flesh, only the
repetition of desires to escape out of it. Well now, we have (stated)
all this in very subdued and delicate phrases, as suited to the
character of our style; but (would you know) how great a licence of
unseemly language these men actually use, you must test them in their
conferences, whether they be heathens or heretics.
