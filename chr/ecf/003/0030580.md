<span id="v.vii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Conclusion. This Treatise Forms
a Preface to the Other Work, “On the Resurrection of the Flesh,” Proving
the Reality of the Flesh Which Was Truly Born, and Died, and Rose
Again.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xxv-p2"></span>But let this suffice on our present
subject; for I think that by this time proof enough has been adduced of
the flesh in Christ having both been born of the virgin, and being human
in its nature. And this discussion alone might have been sufficient,
without encountering the isolated opinions which have been raised from
different quarters. We have, however, challenged these opinions to the
test, both of the arguments which sustain them, and of the Scriptures
which are appealed to, and this we have done *ex abundanti*; so that we
have, by showing what the flesh of Christ was, and whence it was
derived, also predetermined the question, against all objectors, of what
that flesh was not. The resurrection, however, of our own flesh will
have to be maintained in another little treatise, and so bring to a
close this present one, which serves as a general preface, and which
will pave the way *for the approaching subject* now that it is plain
what kind of body that was which rose again in Christ.
