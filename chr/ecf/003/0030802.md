<span id="vi.vii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Further Reasons for Practising
Patience. Its Connection with the Beatitudes.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.xi-p2"></span>After these principal material causes of
impatience, registered to the best of our ability, why should we wander
out of our way among the rest,—what are found at home, what abroad? Wide
and diffusive is the Evil One’s operation, hurling manifold irritations
of our spirit, and sometimes trifling ones, sometimes very great. But
the trifling ones you may contemn from their very littleness; to the
very great ones you may yield in regard of their overpoweringness. Where
the injury is less, there is no necessity for impatience; but where the
injury is greater, there more necessary is the remedy for the
injury—patience.  Let us strive, therefore, to endure the inflictions of
the Evil One, that the counter-zeal of our equanimity may mock the zeal
of the foe. If, however, we ourselves, either by imprudence or else
voluntarily, draw upon ourselves anything, let us meet with equal
patience what we have to blame ourselves for. Moreover, if we believe
that some inflictions are sent on us by the Lord, to whom should we more
exhibit patience than to the Lord? Nay, He teaches <span
id="fr_9123"></span>[9124](#fn_9123.md) us to give thanks and rejoice, over
and above, at being thought worthy of divine chastisement. “Whom I
love,” saith He, “I chasten.” <span id="fr_9124"></span>[9125](#fn_9124.md)
O blessed servant, on whose amendment the Lord is intent! with whom He
deigns to be wroth! whom He does not deceive by dissembling His
reproofs! On every side, therefore, we are bound to the duty of
exercising patience, from whatever quarter, either by our own errors or
else by the snares of the Evil One, we incur the Lord’s reproofs. Of
that duty great is the reward—namely, happiness.  For whom but the
patient has the Lord called happy, in saying, “Blessed are the poor in
spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens?” <span
id="fr_9125"></span>[9126](#fn_9125.md) No one, assuredly, is “poor in
spirit,” except he be humble. Well, who is humble, except he be patient?
For no one can abase himself without patience, in the first instance, to
bear the act of abasement. “Blessed,” saith He, “are the weepers and
mourners.” <span id="fr_9126"></span>[9127](#fn_9126.md) Who, without
patience, is tolerant of such unhappinesses? And so to such,
“consolation” and “laughter” are promised.  “Blessed are the
gentle:” <span id="fr_9127"></span>[9128](#fn_9127.md) under this term,
surely, the impatient cannot possibly be classed. Again, when He marks
“the peacemakers” <span id="fr_9128"></span>[9129](#fn_9128.md) with the
same title of felicity, and names them “sons of God,” pray have the
impatient any affinity with “peace?”  Even a fool may perceive that. 
When, however, He says, “Rejoice and exult, as often as they shall curse
and persecute you; for very great is your reward in heaven,” <span
id="fr_9129"></span>[9130](#fn_9129.md) of course it is not to the
*impatience* of exultation <span id="fr_9130"></span>[9131](#fn_9130.md)
that He makes that promise; because no one *will* “exult” in adversities
unless he have first learnt to contemn them; no one will contemn them
unless he have learnt to practise patience.
