<span id="iv.ix.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.ix.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Further Proofs, from Ezekiel. 
Summary of the Prophetic Argument Thus Far.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p2"></span>For, again, it is for these deserts of
yours that Ezekiel announces your ruin as about to come: and not only in
this age <span id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363) —a ruin which has
already befallen—but in the “day of retribution,” <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364) which will be subsequent. From
which ruin none will be freed but he who shall have been frontally
sealed <span id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365) with the passion of
the Christ whom you have rejected. For thus it is written: “And the Lord
said unto me, Son of man, thou hast seen what the elders of Israel do,
each one of them in darkness, each in a hidden bed-chamber: because they
have said, The Lord seeth us not; the Lord hath derelinquished the
earth. And He said unto me, Turn thee again, and thou shalt see greater
enormities which these do. And He introduced me unto the thresholds of
the gate of the house of the Lord which looketh unto the north; and,
behold, there, women sitting and bewailing Thammuz.  And the Lord said
unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen? Is the house of Judah *moderate*,
to do the enormities which they have done? And yet thou art about to see
greater affections of theirs. And He introduced me into the inner shrine
of the house of the Lord; and, behold, on the thresholds of the house of
the Lord, between the midst of the porch and between the midst of the
altar, <span id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366) as it were twenty and
five men have turned their backs unto the temple of the Lord, and their
faces over against the east; these were adoring the sun. And He said
unto me, Seest thou, son of man? Are such deeds trifles to the house of
Judah, that they should do the enormities which these have done? because
they have filled up (the measure of) their impieties, and, behold, *are*
themselves, as it were, grimacing; I will deal with mine
indignation, <span id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367) mine eye shall
not spare, neither will I pity; they shall cry out unto mine ears with a
loud voice, and I will not hear them, nay, I will not pity. And He cried
into mine ears with a loud voice, saying, The vengeance of this city is
at hand; and each one had vessels of extermination in his hand. And,
behold, six men were coming toward the way of the high gate which was
looking toward the north, and each one’s double-axe of dispersion was in
his hand: and one man in the midst of them, clothed with a garment
reaching to the feet, <span id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368) and a
girdle of sapphire about his loins:  and they entered, and took their
stand close to the brazen altar. And the glory of the God of Israel,
which was over the house, in the open court of it, <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369) ascended from the cherubim: and the
Lord called the man who was clothed with the garment reaching to the
feet, who had upon his loins the girdle; and said unto him, <span
id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span id="iv.ix.xi-Page_168"></span>Pass
through the midst of Jerusalem, and write the sign Tau <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370) on the foreheads of the men who
groan and grieve over all the enormities which are done in their midst.
And while these things were doing, He said unto an hearer, <span
id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371) Go ye after him into the city, and
cut short; and spare not with your eyes, and pity not elder or youth or
virgin; and little ones and women slay ye all, that they may be
thoroughly wiped away; but all upon whom is the sign Tau approach ye
not; and begin with my saints.” <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372) Now the mystery of this “sign” was
in various ways predicted; (a “sign”) in which the foundation of life
was forelaid for mankind; (a “sign”) in which the Jews were not to
believe: just as Moses beforetime kept on announcing in Exodus, <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373) saying, “Ye shall be ejected from
the land into which ye shall enter; and in those nations ye shall not be
able to rest:  and there shall be instability of the print <span
id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374) of thy foot: and God shall give
thee a wearying heart, and a pining soul, and failing eyes, that they
see not: and thy life shall hang on the tree <span
id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375) before thine eyes; and thou shalt
not trust thy life.”

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p16"></span>And so, since prophecy has been fulfilled
through His advent—that is, through the nativity, which we have above
commemorated, and the passion, which we have evidently explained—that is
the reason withal why Daniel said, “Vision and prophet *were sealed*;”
because Christ is the “signet” of all prophets, fulfilling all that had
in days bygone been announced concerning Him: for, since His advent and
personal passion, there is no longer “vision” or “prophet;” whence most
emphatically he says that His advent “*seals* vision and prophecy.” And
thus, by showing “the number of the years, and the time of the lxii and
an half fulfilled hebdomads,” we have proved that at that specified time
Christ came, that is, was born; and, (by showing the time) of the “seven
and an half hebdomads,” which are subdivided so as to be cut off from
the former hebdomads, within which times we have shown Christ to have
suffered, and by the consequent conclusion of the “lxx hebdomads,” and
the extermination of the city, (we have proved) that “sacrifice and
unction” thenceforth cease.

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p17"></span>Sufficient it is thus far, on these
points, to have meantime traced the course of the ordained path of
Christ, by which He is proved to be such as He used to be announced,
even on the ground of that agreement of Scriptures, which has enabled us
to speak out, in opposition to the Jews, on the ground <span
id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376) of the prejudgment of the major
part.  For let them not question or deny the writings we produce; that
the fact also that things which were foretold as destined to happen
*after* Christ are being recognised as fulfilled may make it impossible
for them to deny (these writings) to be on a par with divine Scriptures.
Else, unless He were come *after* whom the things which were wont to be
announced had to be accomplished, would such as have been completed be
proved? <span id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377)

<span id="fn_1367"></span>[167:1368](0030192.htm#fr_1367) <span
id="iv.ix.xi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p7"></span> So Oehler points, and Tischendorf in his
edition of the LXX. points not very differently. I incline to read:
“Because they have filled up the measure of their impieties, and, behold
(are) themselves, as it were, grimacing, I will,” etc.

<span id="fn_1368"></span>[167:1369](0030192.htm#fr_1368) <span

<span id="fn_1369"></span>[167:1370](0030192.htm#fr_1369) <span
id="iv.ix.xi-p8.2"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p9"></span> “Quæ fuit super eam” (i.e. super domum)
“in subdivali domûs” is Oehler’s reading; but it differs from the LXX.

<span id="fn_1370"></span>[168:1371](0030192.htm#fr_1370) <span
id="iv.ix.xi-p9.2"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p10"></span> The <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ix.xi-p10.2"></span>ms.</span> which Oehler usually follows omits
“Tau;” so do the LXX.

<span id="fn_1371"></span>[168:1372](0030192.htm#fr_1371) <span
id="iv.ix.xi-p10.3"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p11"></span> Et in his dixit ad audientem. But the
LXX. reading agrees almost *verbatim* with the Eng. ver.

<span id="fn_1372"></span>[168:1373](0030192.htm#fr_1372) <span
id="iv.ix.xi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p12"></span> [Ezek.
8.12-9.6](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012)<span
id="iv.ix.xi-p12.1"></span> (especially in the LXX.). Comp. *adv. Marc.*
l. iii. c. xxii. But our author differs considerably even from the LXX.

<span id="fn_1373"></span>[168:1374](0030192.htm#fr_1373) <span
id="iv.ix.xi-p12.2"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p13"></span> Or rather in Deuteronomy. See [Deut.
28.65](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065)<span id="iv.ix.xi-p13.1"></span>
sqq.

<span id="fn_1374"></span>[168:1375](0030192.htm#fr_1374) <span
id="iv.ix.xi-p13.2"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p14"></span> Or, “sole.”

<span id="fn_1375"></span>[168:1376](0030192.htm#fr_1375) <span
id="iv.ix.xi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p15"></span> In ligno. There are no such words in the
LXX. If the words be retained, “*thy life*” will mean Christ, who is
called “our Life” in [Col. iii. 4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004)<span
id="iv.ix.xi-p15.1"></span>. See also [John
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004), [John
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006), [John
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025)<span
id="iv.ix.xi-p15.2"></span>. And so, again, “Thou shalt not trust (or
believe) *thy life*” would mean, “Thou shalt not believe Christ.”

<span id="fn_1376"></span>[168:1377](0030192.htm#fr_1376) <span
id="iv.ix.xi-p17.2"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p18"></span> Or, “in accordance with.”

<span id="fn_1377"></span>[168:1378](0030192.htm#fr_1377) <span
id="iv.ix.xi-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p19"></span> i.e., Would they have happened? and,
*by* happening, have been their own proof?
