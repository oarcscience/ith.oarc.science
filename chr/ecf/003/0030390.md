<span id="v.iv.iv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—The Sacred Name Jesus Most
Suited to the Christ of the Creator.  Joshua a Type of Him.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xvi-p2"></span>Now if he caught at the name *Christ*,
just as the pickpocket clutches the dole-basket, why did he wish to be
called *Jesus* too, by a name which was not so much looked for by the
Jews? For although we, who have by God’s grace attained to the
understanding of His mysteries, acknowledge that *this* name also was
destined for Christ, yet, for all that, the fact was not known to the
Jews, from whom wisdom was taken away. To this day, in short, it is
Christ that they are looking for, not Jesus; and they interpret Elias to
be Christ rather than Jesus. He, therefore, who came also in a name in
which Christ was not expected, might have come only in that name which
was solely anticipated for Him. <span
id="fr_3312"></span>[3313](#fn_3312.md) But since he has mixed up the
two, <span id="fr_3313"></span>[3314](#fn_3313.md) the expected one and the
unexpected, his twofold project is defeated. For if he be *Christ* for
the very purpose of insinuating himself as the Creator’s, then *Jesus*
opposes him, because Jesus was not looked for in the Christ of the
Creator; or if he be *Jesus*, in order that he might pass as belonging
to the other (God), then *Christ* hinders him, because Christ was not
expected to belong to any other than the Creator. I know not which one
of these names may be able to hold its ground. <span
id="fr_3314"></span>[3315](#fn_3314.md) In the Christ of the Creator,
however, both will keep their place, for in *Him* a Jesus too is found.
Do you ask, how? Learn it then here, with the Jews also who are
partakers of your heresy.  When Oshea the son of Nun was destined to be
the successor of Moses, is not his old name then changed, and for the
first time he is called <span id="fr_3315"></span>[3316](#fn_3315.md)
Joshua? It is true, you say. This, then, we first observe, was a figure
of Him who was to come. For inasmuch as Jesus Christ was to introduce a
new generation <span id="fr_3316"></span>[3317](#fn_3316.md) (because we
are born in the wilderness of this world) into <span id="page_335">p.
335</span> <span id="v.iv.iv.xvi-Page_335"></span>the promised land
which flows with milk and honey, that is, into the possession of eternal
life, than which nothing can be sweeter; inasmuch, too, as this was to
be brought about not by Moses, that is to say, not by the discipline of
the law, but by Joshua, by the grace of the gospel, our circumcision
being effected by a knife of stone, that is, (by the circumcision) of
Christ, for Christ is a rock (or stone), therefore that great man, <span
id="fr_3317"></span>[3318](#fn_3317.md) who was ordained as a type of this
mystery, was actually consecrated with the figure of the Lord’s own
name, being called Joshua. This name Christ Himself even then testified
to be His own, when He talked with Moses.  For who was it that talked
with him, but the Spirit of the Creator, which is Christ? When He
therefore spake this commandment to the people, “Behold, I send my angel
before thy face, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the
land which I have prepared for thee; attend to him, and obey his voice
and do not provoke him; for he has not shunned you, <span
id="fr_3318"></span>[3319](#fn_3318.md) since my name is upon him,” <span
id="fr_3319"></span>[3320](#fn_3319.md) He called him an *angel* indeed,
because of the greatness of the powers which he was to exercise, and
because of his prophetic office, <span
id="fr_3320"></span>[3321](#fn_3320.md) while announcing the will of God;
but *Joshua* also (Jesus), because it was a type <span
id="fr_3321"></span>[3322](#fn_3321.md) of His own future name. Often <span
id="fr_3322"></span>[3323](#fn_3322.md) did He confirm that name of His
which He had thus conferred upon (His servant); because it was not the
name of *angel*, nor *Oshea*, but *Joshua* (Jesus), which He had
commanded him to bear as his usual appellation for the time to come.
Since, therefore, both these names are suitable to the Christ of the
Creator, they are proportionately unsuitable to the *non-Creator’s*
Christ; and so indeed is all the rest of (our Christ’s) destined
course. <span id="fr_3323"></span>[3324](#fn_3323.md) In short, there must
now for the future be made between us that certain and equitable rule,
necessary to both sides, which shall determine that there ought to be
absolutely nothing at all in common between the Christ of the other god
and the Creator’s Christ. For you will have as great a necessity to
maintain their diversity as we have to resist it, inasmuch as *you* will
be as unable to show that the Christ of the other god has come, until
you have proved him to be a far different being from the Creator’s
Christ, as *we*, to claim Him (who has come) as the Creator’s, until we
have shown Him to be such a one as the Creator has appointed. Now
respecting their names, such is our conclusion against (Marcion). <span
id="fr_3324"></span>[3325](#fn_3324.md) I claim for myself Christ; I
maintain for myself Jesus.
