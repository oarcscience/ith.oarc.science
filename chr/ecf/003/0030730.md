<span id="vi.iii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Of the Imposition of Hands.
Types of the Deluge and the Dove.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.viii-p2"></span>In the next place the hand is laid on
us, invoking and inviting the Holy Spirit through benediction. <span
id="fr_8597"></span>[8598](#fn_8597) Shall it be granted possible for
human ingenuity to summon a spirit into water, and, by the application
of hands from above, to animate their union into one body <span
id="fr_8598"></span>[8599](#fn_8598) with another spirit of so clear
sound; <span id="fr_8599"></span>[8600](#fn_8599) and shall it not be
possible for God, in the case of His own organ, <span
id="fr_8600"></span>[8601](#fn_8600) to produce, by means of “holy
hands,” <span id="fr_8601"></span>[8602](#fn_8601) a sublime spiritual
modulation? But this, as well as the former, is derived from the old
sacramental rite in which Jacob blessed his grandsons, born of Joseph,
Ephrem <span id="fr_8602"></span>[8603](#fn_8602) and Manasses; with his
hands laid on them and interchanged, and indeed so transversely slanted
one over the other, that, by delineating Christ, they even portended the
future benediction into Christ. <span
id="fr_8603"></span>[8604](#fn_8603) Then, <span id="page_673">p.
673</span> <span id="vi.iii.viii-Page_673"></span>over our cleansed and
blessed bodies willingly descends from the Father that Holiest Spirit.
Over the waters of baptism, recognising as it were His primeval
seat, <span id="fr_8604"></span>[8605](#fn_8604) He reposes: (He who)
glided down on the Lord “in the shape of a dove,” <span
id="fr_8605"></span>[8606](#fn_8605) in order that the nature of the
Holy Spirit might be declared by means of the creature (the emblem) of
simplicity and innocence, because even in her bodily structure the dove
is without literal <span id="fr_8606"></span>[8607](#fn_8606) gall. And
accordingly He says, “Be ye simple as doves.” <span
id="fr_8607"></span>[8608](#fn_8607) Even this is not without the
supporting evidence <span id="fr_8608"></span>[8609](#fn_8608) of a
preceding figure. For just as, after the waters of the deluge, by which
the old iniquity was purged—after the baptism, so to say, of the world—a
*dove* was the herald which announced to the earth the assuagement <span
id="fr_8609"></span>[8610](#fn_8609) of celestial wrath, when she had
been sent her way out of the ark, and had returned with the
olive-branch, a sign which even among the nations is the fore-token of
*peace*; <span id="fr_8610"></span>[8611](#fn_8610) so by the self-same
law <span id="fr_8611"></span>[8612](#fn_8611) of heavenly effect, to
earth—that is, to our flesh <span id="fr_8612"></span>[8613](#fn_8612)
—as it emerges from the font, <span id="fr_8613"></span>[8614](#fn_8613)
after its old sins flies the *dove* of the Holy Spirit, bringing us the
peace of God, sent out from the heavens where is the Church, the
typified ark. <span id="fr_8614"></span>[8615](#fn_8614) But the world
returned unto sin; in which point baptism would ill be compared to the
deluge. And so it is destined to fire; just as the man too is, who after
baptism renews his sins: <span id="fr_8615"></span>[8616](#fn_8615) so
that this also ought to be accepted as a sign for our admonition.
