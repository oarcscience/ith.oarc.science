<span id="iv.viii.i.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII. <span
id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md) —The Charge of Worshipping a Cross.
The Heathens Themselves Made Much of Crosses in Sacred Things; Nay,
Their Very Idols Were Formed on a Crucial Frame.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xii-p3"></span>As for him who affirms that we are
“the <span id="page_122">p. 122</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.xii-Page_122"></span>priesthood of a cross,” <span
id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md) we shall claim him <span
id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md) as our co-religionist. <span
id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) A cross is, in its material, a sign of
wood; amongst yourselves also the object of worship is a wooden figure.
Only, whilst with you the figure is a human one, with us the wood is its
own figure.  Never mind <span id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) for the
present what is the shape, provided the material is the same: the form,
too, is of no importance, <span id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md) if so
be it be the actual body of a god.  If, however, there arises a question
of difference on this point what, (let me ask,) is the difference
between the Athenian Pallas, or the Pharian Ceres, and wood formed into
a cross, <span id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) when each is
represented by a rough stock, without form, and by the merest rudiment
of a statue <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) of unformed wood?
Every piece of timber <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) which is
fixed in the ground in an erect position is a part of a cross, and
indeed the greater portion of its mass.  But an entire cross is
attributed to us, with its transverse beam, <span
id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) of course, and its projecting seat.
Now you have the less to excuse you, for you dedicate to religion only a
mutilated imperfect piece of wood, while others consecrate to the sacred
purpose a complete structure. The truth, however, after all is, that
your religion is *all cross*, as I shall show. You are indeed unaware
that your gods in their origin have proceeded from this hated
cross. <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md) Now, every image, whether
carved out of wood or stone, or molten in metal, or produced out of any
other richer material, must needs have had plastic hands engaged in its
formation. Well, then, this modeller, <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) before he did anything else, <span
id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) hit upon the form of a wooden cross,
because even our own body assumes as its natural position the latent and
concealed outline of a cross. Since the head rises upwards, and the back
takes a straight direction, and the shoulders project laterally, if you
simply place a man with his arms and hands outstretched, you will make
the general outline of a cross. Starting, then, from this rudimental
form and prop, <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md) as it were, he
applies a covering of clay, and so gradually completes the limbs, and
forms the body, and covers the cross within with the shape which he
meant to impress upon the clay; then from this design, with the help of
compasses and leaden moulds, he has got all ready for his image which is
to be brought out into marble, or clay, or whatever the material be of
which he has determined to make his god. (This, then, is the process:)
after the cross-shaped frame, the clay; after the clay, the god.  In a
well-understood routine, the cross passes into a god through the clayey
medium. The cross then you consecrate, and from it the consecrated
(deity) begins to derive his origin. <span
id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) By way of example, let us take the
case of a tree which grows up into a system of branches and foliage, and
is a reproduction of its own kind, whether it springs from the kernel of
an olive, or the stone of a peach, or a grain of pepper which has been
duly tempered under ground. Now, if you transplant it, or take a cutting
off its branches for another plant, to what will you attribute what is
produced by the propagation?  Will it not be to the grain, or the stone,
or the kernel? Because, as the third stage is attributable to the
second, and the second in like manner to the first, so the third will
have to be referred to the first, through the second as the mean. We
need not stay any longer in the discussion of this point, since by a
natural law every kind of produce throughout nature refers back its
growth to its original source; and just as the product is comprised in
its primal cause, so does that cause agree in character with the thing
produced. Since, then, in the production of your gods, you worship the
cross which originates them, here will be the original kernel and grain,
from which are propagated the wooden materials of your idolatrous
images. Examples are not far to seek. Your victories you celebrate with
religious ceremony <span id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md) as deities;
and they are the more august in proportion to the joy they bring you.
The frames on which you hang up your trophies must be crosses: these
are, as it were, the very core of your pageants. <span
id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) Thus, in your victories, the religion
of your camp makes even crosses objects of worship; your standards it
adores, your standards are the sanction of its oaths; your standards it
prefers before Jupiter himself. But all that parade <span
id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) of images, and that display of pure
gold, are (as so many) necklaces of the crosses. In like manner also, in
the banners and ensigns, which your soldiers guard with no less sacred
care, you have the streamers (and) vestments of your crosses. You are
ashamed, I suppose, to worship unadorned and simple crosses.
