id="iv.v.i-p6.1"></span>Chapter I.</span>

<span id="iv.v.i-p7"></span>Ye Servants of God, about to draw near to
God, that you may make solemn consecration of yourselves to Him, <span
id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347) seek well to understand the condition
of faith, the reasons of the Truth, the laws of Christian Discipline,
which forbid among other sins of the world, the pleasures of the public
shows. Ye who have testified and confessed <span
id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348) that you have done so already, review
the subject, that there may be no sinning whether through real or wilful
ignorance.  For such is the power of earthly pleasures, that, to retain
the opportunity of still partaking of them, it contrives to prolong a
willing ignorance, and bribes knowledge into playing a dishonest part.
To both things, perhaps, some among you are allured by the views of the
heathens who in this matter are wont to press us with arguments, such as
these: (1) That the exquisite enjoyments of ear and eye we have in
things external are not in the least opposed to religion in the mind and
conscience; and (2) That surely no offence is offered to God, in any
human enjoyment, by any of our pleasures, which it is not sinful to
partake of in its own time and place, with all due honour and reverence
secured to Him. But this is precisely what we are ready to prove:  That
these things are not consistent with true religion and true obedience to
the true God. There are some who imagine that Christians, a sort of
people ever ready to die, are trained into the abstinence they practise,
with no other object than that of making it less difficult to despise
life, the fastenings to it being severed as it were. *They regard it as
an art of* quenching all desire for that which, so far as they are
concerned, they have emptied of all that is desirable; and so it is
thought to be rather a thing of human planning and foresight, than
clearly laid down by divine command. It were a grievous thing, forsooth,
for Christians, while continuing in the enjoyment of pleasures so great,
to die for God! It is not as they say; though, if it were, even
Christian obstinacy might well give all submission to a plan so
suitable, to a rule so excellent.

<span id="iv.v.i-p3"></span> \[It is the opinion of Dr. Neander that
this treatise proceeded from our author before his lapse: but Bp. Kaye
(p. xvi.) finds some exaggerated expressions in it, concerning the
military life, which savour of Montanism. Probably they do, but had he
written the tract as a professed Montanist, they would have been much
less ambiguous, in all probability. At all events, a work so colourless
that doctors can disagree about even its shading, must be regarded as
practically orthodox.  Exaggerated expressions are but the
characteristics of the author’s genius. We find the like in all writers
of strongly marked individuality.  Neander dates this treatise *circa*
<span class="sc"><span id="iv.v.i-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 197. That it
was written at Carthage is the conviction of Kaye and Dr. Allix; see
Kaye, p. 55.\]
