<span id="vi.ii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Of Men’s Shrinking from This Second
Repentance and Exomologesis, and of the Unreasonableness of Such
Shrinking.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.x-p2"></span>Yet most men either shun this work, as
being a public exposure <span id="fr_8511"></span>[8512](#fn_8511) of
themselves, or else defer it from day to day. I presume (as being) more
mindful of modesty than of salvation; just like men who, having
contracted some malady in the more private parts of the body, avoid the
privity of physicians, and so perish with their own bashfulness. It is
intolerable, forsooth, to modesty to make satisfaction to the offended
Lord! to be restored to its forfeited <span
id="fr_8512"></span>[8513](#fn_8512) salvation! Truly you are honourable
in your modesty; bearing an open forehead for sinning, but an abashed
one for deprecating! I give no place to bashfulness when I am a gainer
by its loss; when itself in some son exhorts the man, saying, “Respect
not me; it is better that I perish through <span
id="fr_8513"></span>[8514](#fn_8513) you, *i.e. than you through me*.”
At all events, the time when (if ever) its danger is serious, is when it
is a butt for jeering speech in the presence of insulters, where one man
raises himself on his neighbour’s ruin, where there is upward clambering
over the prostrate.  But among brethren and fellow-servants, where there
is common hope, fear, <span id="fr_8514"></span>[8515](#fn_8514) joy,
grief, suffering, because there is a common Spirit from a common Lord
and Father, why do you think these *brothers* to be anything other than
yourself? Why flee from the partners of your own mischances, as from
such as will derisively cheer them? The body cannot feel gladness at the
trouble of any one member, <span id="fr_8515"></span>[8516](#fn_8515) it
must necessarily join with one consent in the grief, and in labouring
for the remedy. In a company of two <span
id="fr_8516"></span>[8517](#fn_8516) is the church; <span
id="fr_8517"></span>[8518](#fn_8517) but the church is Christ. <span
id="fr_8518"></span>[8519](#fn_8518) When, then, you cast yourself at
the brethren’s knees, you are handling *Christ*, you are entreating
*Christ*. In like manner, when they shed tears over you, it is *Christ*
who suffers, *Christ* who prays the Father for mercy. What a son <span
id="fr_8519"></span>[8520](#fn_8519) asks is ever easily obtained. Grand
indeed is the reward of modesty, which the concealment of our fault
promises us! to wit, if we do hide somewhat from the knowledge of man,
shall we equally conceal it from God? Are the judgment of men and the
knowledge of God so put upon a par?  Is it better to be damned in secret
than absolved in public? *But you say*, “It is a miserable thing thus to
come to *<span class="c42"><span
id="vi.ii.x-p11.2"></span>exomologesis</span>*:” yes, for evil does
bring to misery; but where repentance is to be made, the misery ceases,
because it is turned into something <span id="page_665">p. 665</span>
<span id="vi.ii.x-Page_665"></span>salutary. Miserable it is to be cut,
and cauterized, and racked with the pungency of some (medicinal) powder:
still, the things which heal by unpleasant means do, by the benefit of
the cure, excuse their own offensiveness, and make present injury
bearable for the sake <span id="fr_8520"></span>[8521](#fn_8520) of the
advantage to supervene.
