<span id="v.iv.ii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Dangerous Effects to
Religion and Morality of the Doctrine of So Weak a God.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xxvii-p2"></span>Again, he plainly judges evil by not
willing it, and condemns it by prohibiting it; while, on the other hand,
he acquits it by not avenging it, and lets it go free by not punishing
it. What a prevaricator of truth is such a god! What a dissembler with
his own decision! Afraid to condemn what he really condemns, afraid to
hate what he does not love, permitting that to be done which he does not
allow, choosing to indicate what he dislikes rather than deeply examine
it! This will turn out an imaginary goodness, a phantom of discipline,
perfunctory in duty, careless in sin. Listen, ye sinners; and ye who
have not yet come to this, hear, that you may attain to such a pass! A
better god has been discovered, who never takes offence, is never angry,
never inflicts punishment, who has prepared no fire in hell, no gnashing
of teeth in the outer darkness! He is purely and simply good. He indeed
forbids all delinquency, but only in word. He is in you, if you are
willing to pay him homage, <span id="fr_2659"></span>[2660](#fn_2659.md)
for the sake of appearances, that you may seem to honour God; for your
fear he does not want. And so satisfied are the Marcionites with such
pretences, that they have no fear of their god at all. They say it is
only a bad man who will be feared, a good man will be loved.  Foolish
man, do you say that he whom you call Lord ought not to be feared,
whilst the very title you give him indicates a power which must itself
be feared? But how are you going to love, without some fear that you do
not love?  Surely (such a god) is neither your Father, towards whom your
love for duty’s sake should be consistent with fear because of His
power; nor your proper <span id="fr_2660"></span>[2661](#fn_2660.md) Lord,
whom you should love for His humanity and fear as your teacher. <span
id="fr_2661"></span>[2662](#fn_2661.md) Kidnappers <span
id="fr_2662"></span>[2663](#fn_2662.md) indeed are loved after this
fashion, but they are not feared. For power will not be feared, except
it be just and regular, although it may possibly be loved even when
corrupt: for it is by allurement that it stands, not by authority; by
flattery, not by proper influence. And what can be more direct flattery
than not to punish sins? Come, then, if you do not fear God as being
good, why do you not boil over into every kind of lust, and so realize
that which is, I believe, the main enjoyment of life to all who fear not
God? Why do you not frequent the customary pleasures of the maddening
circus, the bloodthirsty arena, and <span id="page_293">p. 293</span>
<span id="v.iv.ii.xxvii-Page_293"></span>the lascivious theatre? <span
id="fr_2663"></span>[2664](#fn_2663.md) Why in persecutions also do you
not, when the censer is presented, at once redeem your life by the
denial of your faith? God forbid, you say with redoubled <span
id="fr_2664"></span>[2665](#fn_2664.md) emphasis. So you do fear sin, and
by your fear prove that He is an object of fear Who forbids the sin.
This is quite a different matter from that obsequious homage you pay to
the god whom you do not fear, which is identical in perversity indeed to
is own conduct, in prohibiting a thing without annexing the sanction of
punishment. Still more vainly do they act, who when asked, What is to
become of every sinner in that great day? reply, that he is to be cast
away out of sight. Is not even this a question of judicial
determination? He is adjudged to deserve rejection, and that by a
sentence of condemnation; unless the sinner is cast away forsooth for
his salvation, that even a leniency like this may fall in consistently
with the character of your most good and excellent god! And what will it
be to be cast away, but to lose that which a man was in the way of
obtaining, were it not for his rejection—that is, his salvation? 
Therefore his being cast away will involve the forfeiture of salvation;
and this sentence cannot possibly be passed upon him, except by an angry
and offended authority, who is also the punisher of sin—that is, by a
judge.
