<span id="iv.xi.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—The Fidelity of the Senses,
Impugned by Plato, Vindicated by Christ Himself.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xvii-p2"></span>Then, again, when we encounter the
question (as to the veracity of those five senses which we learn with
our alphabet; since from this source even there arises some support for
our heretics. They are the faculties of seeing, and hearing, and
smelling, and tasting, and touching. The fidelity of these senses is
impugned with too much severity by the Platonists, <span
id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605.md) and according to some by Heraclitus
also, and Diocles, and Empedocles; at any rate, Plato, in the *Timæus*,
declares the operations of the senses to be irrational, and
vitiated <span id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md) by our opinions or
beliefs. Deception is imputed to the sight, because it asserts that
oars, when immersed in the water, are inclined or bent, notwithstanding
the certainty that they are straight; because, again, it is quite sure
that that distant tower with its really quadrangular contour is round;
because also it will discredit the fact of the truly parallel fabric of
yonder porch or arcade, by supposing it to be narrower and narrower
towards its end; and because it will join with the sea the sky which
hangs at so great a height above it.  In the same way, our hearing is
charged with fallacy: we think, for instance, that that is a noise in
the sky which is nothing else than the rumbling of a carriage; or, if
you prefer it <span id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) the other way,
when the thunder rolled at a distance, we were quite sure that it was a
carriage which made the noise.  Thus, too, are our faculties of smell
and taste at fault, because the selfsame perfumes and wines lose their
value after we have used them awhile. On the same principle our touch is
censured, when the identical pavement which seemed rough to the hands is
felt by the feet to be smooth enough; and in the baths a stream of warm
water is pronounced to be quite hot at first, and beautifully temperate
afterwards. Thus, according to them, our senses deceive us, when all the
while *we* are (the cause of the discrepancies, by) changing our
opinions. The Stoics are more moderate in their views; <span
id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span id="iv.xi.xvii-Page_196"></span>for
they do not load with the obloquy of deception every one of the senses,
and at all times. The Epicureans, again, show still greater consistency,
in maintaining that all the senses are equally true in their testimony,
and always so—only in a different way. It is not our organs of sensation
that are at fault, but our opinion. The senses only experience
sensation, they do not exercise opinion; it is the soul that *opines*.
They separated opinion from the senses, and sensation from the soul.
Well, but whence comes opinion, if not from the senses? Indeed, unless
the eye had descried a round shape in that tower, it could have had no
idea that it possessed roundness. Again, whence arises sensation if not
from the soul? For if the soul had no body, it would have no sensation.
Accordingly, sensation comes from the soul, and opinion from sensation;
and the whole (process) is the soul. But further, it may well be
insisted on that there is a something which causes the discrepancy
between the report of the senses and the reality of the facts.  Now,
since it is possible, (as we have seen), for phenomena to be reported
which exist not in the objects, why should it not be equally possible
for phenomena to be reported which are caused not by the senses, but by
reasons and conditions which intervene, in the very nature of the case?
If so, it will be only right that they should be duly recognised. The
truth is, that it was the water which was the cause of the oar seeming
to be inclined or bent: out of the water, it was perfectly straight in
appearance (as well as in fact).  The delicacy of the substance or
medium which forms a mirror by means of its luminosity, according as it
is struck or shaken, by the vibration actually destroys the appearance
of the straightness of a right line. In like manner, the condition of
the open space which fills up the interval between it and us,
necessarily causes the true shape of the tower to escape our notice; for
the uniform density of the surrounding air covering its angles with a
similar light obliterates their outlines. So, again, the equal breadth
of the arcade is sharpened or narrowed off towards its termination,
until its aspect, becoming more and more contracted under its prolonged
roof, comes to a vanishing point in the direction of its farthest
distance. So the sky blends itself with the sea, the vision becoming
spent at last, which had maintained duly the boundaries of the two
elements, so long as its vigorous glance lasted. As for the (alleged
cases of deceptive) hearing, what else could produce the illusion but
the similarity of the sounds? And if the perfume afterwards was less
strong to the smell, and the wine more flat to the taste, and the water
not so hot to the touch, their original strength was after all found in
the whole of them pretty well unimpaired. In the matter, however, of the
roughness and smoothness of the pavement, it was only natural and right
that limbs like the hands and the feet, so different in tenderness and
callousness, should have different impressions. In this way, then, there
cannot occur an illusion in our senses without an adequate cause. Now if
special causes, (such as we have indicated,) mislead our senses and
(through our senses) our opinions also, then we must no longer ascribe
the deception to the senses, which follow the specific causes of the
illusion, nor to the opinions we form; for these are occasioned and
controlled by our senses, which only follow the causes. Persons who are
afflicted with madness or insanity, mistake one object for another. 
Orestes in his sister sees his mother; Ajax sees Ulysses in the
slaughtered herd; Athamas and Agave descry wild beasts in their
children. Now is it their eyes or their phrenzy which you must blame for
so vast a fallacy?  All things taste bitter, in the redundancy of their
bile, to those who have the jaundice. Is it their taste which you will
charge with the physical prevarication, or their ill state of health?
All the senses, therefore, are disordered occasionally, or imposed upon,
but only in such a way as to be quite free of any fault in their own
natural functions. But further still, not even against the specific
causes and conditions themselves must we lay an indictment of deception.
For, since these physical aberrations happen for stated reasons, the
reasons do not deserve to be regarded as deceptions. Whatever ought to
occur in a certain manner is not a deception. If, then, even these
circumstantial causes must be acquitted of all censure and blame, how
much more should we free from reproach the senses, over which the said
causes exercise a liberal sway! Hence we are bound most certainly to
claim for the senses truth, and fidelity, and integrity, seeing that
they never render any other account of their impressions than is
enjoined on them by the specific causes or conditions which in all cases
produce that discrepancy which appears between the report of the senses
and the reality of the objects. What mean you, then, O most insolent
Academy? You overthrow the entire condition of human life; you disturb
the whole order of nature; you obscure the good providence of God
Himself: for the senses of man which God has appointed over all His
works, that we might understand, inhabit, dispense, and enjoy them, (you
re<span id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span
id="iv.xi.xvii-Page_197"></span>proach) as fallacious and treacherous
tyrants! But is it not from these that all creation receives our
services?  Is it not by their means that a second form is impressed even
upon the world?—so many arts, so many industrious resources, so many
pursuits, such business, such offices, such commerce, such remedies,
counsels, consolations, modes, civilizations, and accomplishments of
life! All these things have produced the very relish and savour of human
existence; whilst by these senses of man, he alone of all animated
nature has the distinction of being a rational animal, with a capacity
for intelligence and knowledge—nay, an ability to form the Academy
itself! But Plato, in order to disparage the testimony of the senses, in
the *Phædrus* denies (in the person of Socrates) his own ability to know
even himself, according to the injunction of the Delphic oracle; and in
the *Theætetus* he deprives himself of the faculties of knowledge and
sensation; and again, in the *Phædrus* he postpones till after death the
posthumous knowledge, as he calls it, of the truth; and yet for all he
went on playing the philosopher even before he died. We may not, I say,
we may not call into question the truth of the (poor vilified)
senses, <span id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608.md) lest we should even
in Christ Himself, bring doubt upon <span
id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609.md) the truth of their sensation; lest
perchance it should be said that He did *not* really “behold Satan as
lightning fall from heaven;” <span id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610.md)
that He did *not* really hear the Father’s voice testifying of
Himself; <span id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611.md) or that He was
deceived in touching Peter’s wife’s mother; <span
id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md) or that the fragrance of the
ointment which He afterwards smelled was different from that which He
accepted for His burial; <span id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) and
that the taste of the wine was different from that which He consecrated
in memory of His blood. <span id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md) On
this false principle it was that Marcion actually chose to believe that
He was a phantom, denying to Him the reality of a perfect body. Now, not
even to His apostles was His nature ever a matter of deception. He was
truly both seen and heard upon the mount; <span
id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615.md) true and real was the draught of
that wine at the marriage of (Cana in) Galilee; <span
id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md) true and real also was the touch of
the then believing Thomas. <span id="fr_1617"></span>[1618](#fn_1617.md)
Read the testimony of John: “That which we have seen, which we have
heard, which we have looked upon with our eyes, and our hands have
handled, of the Word of life.” <span
id="fr_1618"></span>[1619](#fn_1618.md) False, of course, and deceptive
must have been that testimony, if the witness of our eyes, and ears, and
hands be by nature a lie.
