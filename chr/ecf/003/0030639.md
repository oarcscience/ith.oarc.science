<span id="v.viii.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVII.—Our Bodies, However Mutilated
Before or After Death, Shall Recover Their Perfect Integrity in the
Resurrection. Illustration of the Enfranchised Slave.</span>

<span id="v.viii.lvii-p2"></span>We now come to the most usual cavil of
unbelief. If, they say, it be actually the selfsame substance which is
recalled *to life* with all its form, and lineaments, and quality, then
why not with all its other characteristics?  Then the blind, and the
lame, and the palsied, and whoever else may have passed away with any
conspicuous mark, will return again with the same. What now is the fact,
although you in the greatness of your conceit <span
id="fr_7719"></span>[7720](#fn_7719) thus disdain to accept from God so
vast a grace? Does it not happen that, when you now admit the salvation
of only the soul, you ascribe it to men at the cost of half their
nature? What is the good of believing in the resurrection, unless your
faith embraces the whole of it? If the flesh is to be repaired after its
dissolution, much more will it be restored after some violent injury.
Greater cases prescribe rules for lesser ones. Is not the amputation or
the crushing of a limb the death of that limb?  Now, if the death of the
whole person is rescinded by its resurrection, what must we say of the
death of a part of him?  If we are changed for glory, how much more for
integrity! <span id="fr_7720"></span>[7721](#fn_7720) Any loss sustained
by our bodies is an accident to them, but their entirety is their
natural property. In this condition we are born. Even if we become
injured in the womb, this is loss suffered by what is already a human
being. Natural condition <span id="fr_7721"></span>[7722](#fn_7721) is
prior to injury. As life is bestowed by God, so is <span
id="page_590">p. 590</span> <span id="v.viii.lvii-Page_590"></span>it
restored by Him. As we are when we receive it, so are we when we recover
it. To nature, not to injury, are we restored; to our state by birth,
not to our condition by accident, do we rise again. If God raises not
men entire, He raises not the dead. For what dead man is entire,
although he dies entire? Who is without hurt, that is without life? What
body is uninjured, when it is dead, when it is cold, when it is ghastly,
when it is stiff, when it is a corpse? When is a man more infirm, than
when he is entirely infirm? When more palsied, than when quite
motionless? Thus, for a dead man to be raised again, amounts to nothing
short of his being restored to his entire condition,—lest he, forsooth,
be still dead in that part in which he has not risen again. God is quite
able to re-make what He once made. This power and this unstinted grace
of His He has already sufficiently guaranteed in Christ; and has
displayed Himself to us (in Him) not only as the restorer of the flesh,
but as the repairer of its breaches.  And so the apostle says: “The dead
shall be raised incorruptible” (or unimpaired). <span
id="fr_7722"></span>[7723](#fn_7722) But how so, unless they become
entire, who have wasted away either in the loss of their health, or in
the long decrepitude of the grave? For when he propounds the two
clauses, that “this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this
mortal must put on immortality,” <span
id="fr_7723"></span>[7724](#fn_7723) he does not repeat the same
statement, but sets forth a distinction. For, by assigning *immortality*
to the repeating of death, and *incorruption* to the repairing of the
wasted body, he has fitted one to the raising and the other to the
retrieval *of the body*. I suppose, moreover, that he promises to the
Thessalonians the integrity of the whole substance of man. <span
id="fr_7724"></span>[7725](#fn_7724) So that for the great future there
need be no fear of blemished or defective bodies.  Integrity, whether
the result of preservation or restoration, will be able to lose nothing
more, after the time that it has given back to it whatever it had lost.
Now, when you contend that the flesh will still have to undergo the same
sufferings, if the same flesh be said to have to rise again, you rashly
set up nature against her Lord, and impiously contrast *her* law against
*His* grace; as if it were not permitted the Lord God both to change
nature, and to preserve her, without subjection to a law. How is it,
then, that we read, “With men these things are impossible, but with God
all things are possible;” <span id="fr_7725"></span>[7726](#fn_7725) and
again, “God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the
wise?” <span id="fr_7726"></span>[7727](#fn_7726) Let me ask you, if you
were to manumit your slave (seeing that the same flesh and soul will
remain to him, which once were exposed to the whip, and the fetter, and
the stripes), will it therefore be fit for him to undergo the same old
sufferings?  I trow not. He is instead thereof honoured with the grace
of the white robe, and the favour of the gold ring, and the name and
tribe as well as table of his patron. Give, then, the same prerogative
to God, by virtue of such a change, of reforming our condition, not our
nature, by taking away from it all sufferings, and surrounding it with
safeguards of protection. Thus our flesh shall remain even after the
resurrection—so far indeed susceptible of suffering, as it is the flesh,
and the same flesh too; but at the same time impassible, inasmuch as it
has been liberated by the Lord for the very end and purpose of being no
longer capable of enduring suffering.
