id="v.vi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—These Remaining Chapters an
Appendix to the Main Work. In This Chapter Tertullian Notices a
Difference Among Sundry Followers of Ptolemy, a Disciple of
Valentinus.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxiii-p2"></span>I shall now at last produce, by way of
*finale*, <span id="fr_6915"></span>[6916](#fn_6915) after so long a
story, those points which, not to interrupt the course of it, and by the
interruption distract the reader’s attention, I have preferred reserving
to this place. They have been variously advanced by those who have
improved on <span id="fr_6916"></span>[6917](#fn_6916) the doctrines of
Ptolemy. For there have been in his school “disciples above their
master,” who have attributed to their Bythus two wives—Cogitatio
(*Thought*) and Voluntas (*Will*). For Cogitatio alone was not
sufficient wherewith to produce any offspring, although from the two
wives procreation was most easy to him. The former bore him Monogenes
(*Only-Begotten*) and Veritas (*Truth*). Veritas was a female after the
likeness of Cogitatio; Monogenes a male bearing a resemblance to
Voluntas. For it is the strength of Voluntas which procures the
masculine nature, <span id="fr_6917"></span>[6918](#fn_6917) inasmuch as
she affords efficiency to Cogitatio.
