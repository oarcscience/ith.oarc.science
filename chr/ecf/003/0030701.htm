<p class="c30"><a name="v.xi.iv-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="v.xi.iv-p1.1"></A>Chapter IV.&#8212;Valentinus, Ptolemy and Secundus, Heracleon.</span></p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="v.xi.iv-p2"></A>Valentinus the heretic, moreover, introduced many fables. These I will retrench and briefly summarize.&#160; For he introduces the Pleroma and the thirty &AElig;ons. These &AElig;ons, moreover, he explains in the way of syzygies, that is, conjugal unions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8380"></A><A HREF="#fn_8380"><FONT SIZE="1">8381</FONT></A>
 of some kind. For among the first,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8381"></A><A HREF="#fn_8381"><FONT SIZE="1">8382</FONT></A>
 he says, were Depth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8382"></A><A HREF="#fn_8382"><FONT SIZE="1">8383</FONT></A>
 and Silence; of these proceeded Mind and Truth; out of whom burst the Word and Life; from whom, again, were created Man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8383"></A><A HREF="#fn_8383"><FONT SIZE="1">8384</FONT></A>
 and the Church. But (these are not all); for of these last also proceeded twelve &AElig;ons; from Speech,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8384"></A><A HREF="#fn_8384"><FONT SIZE="1">8385</FONT></A>
 moreover, and Life <i>proceeded</i> other ten &AElig;ons: such is the Triacontad of &AElig;ons, which is made up in the Pleroma of an ogdoad, a decad, and a duodecad. The thirtieth &AElig;on, moreover, willed to see the great Bythus; and, to see him, had the hardihood to ascend into the upper regions; and not being capable of seeing his magnitude, desponded,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8385"></A><A HREF="#fn_8385"><FONT SIZE="1">8386</FONT></A>
 and almost suffered dissolution, had not some one,&#8212;he whom he calls Horos, to wit,&#8212;sent to invigorate him, strengthened him by pronouncing the word &#8220;Iao.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8386"></A><A HREF="#fn_8386"><FONT SIZE="1">8387</FONT></A>
 This &AElig;on, moreover, which was thus reduced to despondency, he calls Achamoth, (and says) that he was seized with certain regretful passions, and out of his passions gave birth to material essences.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8387"></A><A HREF="#fn_8387"><FONT SIZE="1">8388</FONT></A>
 For he was panic-stricken, he says, and terror-stricken, and overcome with sadness; and of these passions he conceived and bare. Hence he made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and whatever is in them: for which cause all things made by him are infirm, and frail, and capable of falling, and mortal, inasmuch as he himself was conceived and produced from despondency.&#160; He, however, originated this world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8388"></A><A HREF="#fn_8388"><FONT SIZE="1">8389</FONT></A>
 out of those material essences which Achamoth, by his panic, or terror, or sadness, or sweat, had supplied. For of his panic, he says, was made darkness; of his fear and ignorance, the spirits of wickedness and malignity; of his sadness and tears, the humidities of founts, the material essence of floods and sea.&#160; Christ, moreover, was sent by that First-Father who is Bythus. He, moreover, was not in the substance of our flesh; but, bringing down from heaven some spiritual body or other, passed through the Virgin Mary as water through a pipe, neither receiving nor borrowing aught thence. The resurrection of our present flesh he denies, but (maintains that) of some sister-flesh.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8389"></A><A HREF="#fn_8389"><FONT SIZE="1">8390</FONT></A>
 Of the Law and the prophets some parts he approves, some he disapproves; that is, he disapproves all in reprobating some. A Gospel of his own he likewise has, beside these of ours.</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="v.xi.iv-p13"></A>After him arose the heretics Ptolemy and Secundus, who agree throughout with Valentinus, differing only in the following point: viz., whereas Valentinus had feigned but thirty &AElig;ons, they have added several more; for they first added four, and subsequently four more. And Valentine&#146;s assertion, that it was the thirtieth &AElig;on which strayed out from the Pleroma, (as <i>falling</i> into despondency,) they deny; for the one which desponded on account of disappointed yearning to see the First-Father was not of the original triacontad, they say.</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="v.xi.iv-p14"></A>There arose, besides, Heracleon, a brother&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8390"></A><A HREF="#fn_8390"><FONT SIZE="1">8391</FONT></A>
-heretic, whose sentiments pair with Valentine&#146;s; but, by some novelty of terminology, he is desirous of seeming to differ in sentiment.&#160; For he introduces the notion that there existed first what he terms (a Monad);&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8391"></A><A HREF="#fn_8391"><FONT SIZE="1">8392</FONT></A>
 and then out of that Monad (arose) two, and then the <A NAME="page_653"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 653</FONT></A> <a name="v.xi.iv-Page_653"></A>rest of the &AElig;ons. Then he introduces the whole <i>system of</i> Valentine.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="v.xi.iv-p9"></A> Cf. <i>adv. Valent.</i> cc. x. xiv.&#160; [Routh says that this IAO (see note 8) is wanting in the older editions. It was borrowed from the <i>Adv. Valentin.</i> to eke out a defect.]</p>
<A NAME="fn_8387"></A><A HREF="0030701.htm#fr_8387">652:8388</A> <a name="v.xi.iv-p9.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="v.xi.iv-p10"></A> Such appears to be the meaning of this sentence as Oehler gives it.&#160; But the text is here corrupt; and it seems plain there must either be something lost relating to this &#8220;Achamoth,&#8221; or else some capital error in the reading, or, thirdly, some gross and unaccountable confusion in the writer: for the sentence as it stands is wholly irreconcilable with what follows. It evidently makes &#8220;Achamoth&#8221; identical with &#8220;the thirtieth &AElig;on&#8221; above-named; and yet, without introducing any fresh subject, the writer goes on to state that this despondent &#338;on, who &#8220;conceived and bare,&#8221; was itself the offspring of despondency, and made an infirm world out of the infirm materials which &#8220;Achamoth&#8221; supposed it with. Now it is apparent from other sources&#8212;as, for instance, from <i>Tert. adv. Valentin</i>, above referred to&#8212;that the &#8220;thirtieth &AElig;on&#8221; was supposed to be <i>female</i>, <i>Sophia</i> (Wisdom) by name, and that she was said to be <i>the parent</i> of &#8220;Achamoth,&#8221; or &#8220;Enthymesis&#8221; (see <i>adv. Valentin.</i> cc. ix. x. xi. xiv. xxv.), while &#8220;Achamoth&#8221; herself appears by some accounts to be also called <span class="Greek"><a name="v.xi.iv-p10.1"></A>&#954;&#8049;&#964;&#969; &#931;&#959;&#966;&#8055;&#945;</span>. The name &#8220;Achamoth&#8221; itself, which Tertullian (<i>adv. Valentin.</i> c. xiv. <i>ad init.</i>) calls an &#8220;uninterpretable name,&#8221; is believed to be a representation of a Hebrew word meaning &#8220;wisdom;&#8221; and hence, possibly, some of the confusion may have arisen,&#8212;from a promiscuous use, namely, of the titles &#8220;Achamoth&#8221; and &#8220;Sophia.&#8221; Moreover, it would appear that some words lower down as to the production by &#8220;Achamoth&#8221; of &#8220;Demiurgus,&#8221; must have dropped out. Unless these two omissions be supplied, the passage is wholly unintelligible.&#160; Can the fact that the Hebrew word which &#8220;Achamoth&#8221; represents is a <i>fem. pl.</i> in any way explain this confused medley, or help to reconcile conflicting accounts? The <span class="Greek"><a name="v.xi.iv-p10.2"></A>&#7940;&#957;&#969;</span> and <span class="Greek"><a name="v.xi.iv-p10.3"></A>&#954;&#8049;&#964;&#969; &#931;&#959;&#966;&#8055;&#945;</span> seem to point in some degree to some such solution of some of the existing difficulties. &#8220;Iao,&#8221; again, is a word which has cause much perplexity. Can it possibly be connected with <span class="Greek"><a name="v.xi.iv-p10.4"></A>&#7984;&#8049;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</span>, &#8220;to heal?&#8221; [See note 8.]</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="v.xi.iv-p12"></A> Oehler&#146;s suggestion is to vary the pointing so as to give this sense:&#160; &#8220;The resurrection of this flesh he denies. But of a sister-Law and prophets,&#8221; etc. But this seems even more harsh than the other.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="v.xi.iv-p16"></A> It seems almost necessary to supply some word here; and as &#8220;Monade&#8221; follows, it seemed simple to supply &#8220;Monada.&#8221;</p>
