<span id="iv.viii.ii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—The Physical Theory Continued.
Further Reasons Advanced Against the Divinity of the Elements.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.v-p2"></span>Why, then, do we not resort to that
far more reasonable <span id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849.md) opinion,
which has clear proof of being derived from men’s common sense and
unsophisticated deduction? <span id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850.md) Even
Varro bears it in mind, when he says that the elements are supposed to
be divine, because nothing whatever is capable, without their
concurrence, <span id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851.md) of being produced,
nourished, or applied to the sustenance <span
id="fr_852"></span>[853](#fn_852.md) of man’s life and of the earth, since
not even our bodies and souls could have sufficed in themselves without
the modification <span id="fr_853"></span>[854](#fn_853.md) of the
elements. By this it is that the world is made generally habitable,—a
result which is harmoniously secured <span
id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854.md) by the distribution into zones, <span
id="fr_855"></span>[856](#fn_855.md) except where human residence has been
rendered impracticable by intensity of cold or heat. On this account,
men have accounted as gods—the sun, because it imparts from itself the
light of day, ripens the fruit with its warmth, and measures the year
with its stated periods; the moon, which is at once the solace of the
night and the controller of the months by its governance; the stars
also, certain indications as they are of those seasons which are to be
observed in the tillage of our fields; lastly, the very heaven also
under which, and the earth over which, as well as the intermediate space
within which, all things conspire together for the good of man. Nor is
it from their beneficent influences only that a faith in their divinity
has been deemed compatible with the elements, but from their opposite
qualities also, such as usually happen from what one might call <span
id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856.md) their wrath and anger—as thunder, and
hail, and drought, and pestilential winds, floods also, and openings of
the ground, and earthquakes: these are all fairly enough <span
id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857.md) accounted gods, whether their nature
becomes the object of reverence as being favourable, or of fear because
terrible—the sovereign dispenser, <span
id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858.md) in fact, <span
id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859.md) both of help and of hurt. But in the
practical conduct of <span id="page_134">p. 134</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.v-Page_134"></span>social life, this is the way in which
men act and feel: they do not show gratitude or find fault with the very
things from which the succour or the injury proceeds, so much as with
them by whose strength and power the operation of the things is
effected. For even in your amusements you do not award the crown as a
prize to the flute or the harp, but to the musician who manages the said
flute or harp by the power of his delightful skill. <span
id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860.md) In like manner, when one is in
ill-health, you do not bestow your acknowledgments on the flannel
wraps, <span id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md) or the medicines, or the
poultices, but on the doctors by whose care and prudence the remedies
become effectual.  So again, in untoward events, they who are wounded
with the sword do not charge the injury on the sword or the spear, but
on the enemy or the robber; whilst those whom a falling house covers do
not blame the tiles or the stones, but the oldness of the building; as
again shipwrecked sailors impute their calamity not to the rocks and
waves, but to the tempest. And rightly too; for it is certain that
everything which happens must be ascribed not to the instrument with
which, but to the agent by whom, it takes place; inasmuch as he is the
prime cause of the occurrence, <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md)
who appoints both the event itself and that by whose instrumentality it
comes to pass (as there are in all things these three particular
elements—the fact itself, its instrument, and its cause), because he
himself who wills the occurrence of a thing comes into notice <span
id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md) prior to the thing which he wills, or
the instrument by which it occurs. On all other occasions therefore,
your conduct is right enough, because you consider the author; but in
physical phenomena your rule is opposed to that natural principle which
prompts you to a wise judgment in all other cases, removing out of sight
as you do the supreme position of the author, and considering rather the
things that happen, than him by whom they happen. Thus it comes to pass
that you suppose the power and the dominion to belong to the elements,
which are but the slaves and functionaries.  Now do we not, in thus
tracing out an artificer and master within, expose the artful structure
of their slavery <span id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md) out of the
appointed functions of those elements to which you ascribe (the
attributes) of power? <span id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) But gods
are not slaves; therefore whatever things are servile in character are
not gods.  Otherwise <span id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md) they should
prove to us that, according to the ordinary course of things, liberty is
promoted by irregular licence, <span id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md)
despotism by liberty, and that by despotism divine power is meant. For
if all the (heavenly bodies) overhead forget not <span
id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md) to fulfil their courses in certain
orbits, in regular seasons, at proper distances, *and* at equal
intervals—appointed in the way of a law for the revolutions of time, and
for directing the guidance thereof—can it fail to result <span
id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869.md) from the very observance of their
conditions and the fidelity of their operations, that you will be
convinced both by the recurrence of their orbital courses and the
accuracy of their mutations, when you bear in mind how ceaseless is
their recurrence, that a governing power presides over them, to which
the entire management of the world <span
id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870.md) is obedient, reaching even to the
utility and injury of the human race? For you cannot pretend that these
(phenomena) act and care for themselves alone, without contributing
anything to the advantage of mankind, when you maintain that the
elements are divine for no other reason than that you experience from
them either benefit or injury to yourself. For if they benefit
themselves only, you are under no obligation to them.
