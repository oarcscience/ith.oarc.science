<span id="vi.vii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—God Himself an Example of
Patience.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p2"></span>To *us* <span
id="fr_9019"></span>[9020](#fn_9019) no human affectation of
canine <span id="fr_9020"></span>[9021](#fn_9020) equanimity,
modelled <span id="fr_9021"></span>[9022](#fn_9021) by insensibility,
furnishes the warrant for exercising patience; but the divine
arrangement of a living and celestial discipline, holding up before us
God <span id="page_708">p. 708</span> <span
id="vi.vii.ii-Page_708"></span>Himself in the very first place as an
example of patience; who scatters equally over just and unjust the bloom
of this light; who suffers the good offices of the seasons, the services
of the elements, the tributes of entire nature, to accrue at once to
worthy and unworthy; bearing with the most ungrateful nations, adoring
*as they do* the toys of the arts and the works of their own hands,
persecuting His Name together with His family; *bearing with* luxury,
avarice, iniquity, malignity, waxing insolent daily: <span
id="fr_9022"></span>[9023](#fn_9022) so that by His own patience He
disparages Himself; for the cause why many believe not in the Lord is
that they are so long without knowing <span
id="fr_9023"></span>[9024](#fn_9023) that He is wroth with the
world. <span id="fr_9024"></span>[9025](#fn_9024)

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p3"></span> i.e. us Christians.

<span id="fn_9020"></span>[707:9021](0030793.htm#fr_9020) <span
id="vi.vii.ii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p4"></span> i.e. cynical = <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.vii.ii-p4.1"></span>κυνικός</span> = doglike. But Tertullian
appears to use “caninæ” purposely, and I have therefore retained it
rather than substitute (as Mr. Dodgson does) “cynical.”

<span id="fn_9021"></span>[707:9022](0030793.htm#fr_9021) <span
id="vi.vii.ii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p5"></span> i.e. the *affectation* is modelled by
insensibility.

id="vi.vii.ii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p6"></span> See [Ps. lxxiv.
23](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#023)<span id="vi.vii.ii-p6.1"></span> in
A.V. It is [Ps. lxxiii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#000)<span
id="vi.vii.ii-p6.2"></span> in the LXX.
