<span id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Wrong Derivation of the
Word</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p1.2"></span>Θεός</span><span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p1.3"></span>. The Name Indicative of the True Deity.
God Without Shape and Immaterial. Anecdote of Thales.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p2"></span>Some affirm that the gods (*i.e.*
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>θεοί</span>)
were so called because the verbs <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p2.2"></span>θέειν</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p2.3"></span>σείσθαι</span>
signify *to run* and *to be moved*. <span
id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md) This term, then, is not indicative of
any majesty, for it is derived from running and motion, not from any
dominion <span id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md) of godhead. But
inasmuch as the Supreme God whom we worship is also designated <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p4.1"></span>Θεός</span>, without
however the appearance of any *course* or *motion* in Him, because He is
not visible to any one, it is clear that that word must have had some
other derivation, and that the property of divinity, innate in Himself,
must have been discovered. Dismissing, then, that ingenious
interpretation, it is more likely that the gods were not called <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p4.2"></span>θεοί</span> from
*running* and *motion*, but that the term was borrowed from the
designation of the true God; so that you gave the name <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p4.3"></span>θεοί</span> to the
gods, whom you had in like manner forged for yourselves.  Now, that this
is the case, a plain proof is afforded in the fact that you actually
give the common appellation <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p4.4"></span>θεοί</span> to all those gods of yours,
in whom there is no attribute of *course* or *motion* indicated. When,
therefore, you call them both <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p4.5"></span>θεοί</span> and *immoveable* with equal
readiness, there is a deviation as well from the meaning of the word as
from the idea <span id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md) of godhead, which
is set aside <span id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md) if measured by the
notion of *course* and *motion*. But if that *sacred* name be peculiarly
significant of deity, and be simply true and not of a forced
interpretation <span id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838.md) in the case of
the *true* God, but transferred in a borrowed sense <span
id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839.md) to those other objects which you
choose to call gods, then you ought to show to us <span
id="fr_840"></span>[841](#fn_840.md) that there is also a community of
character between them, so that their common designation may rightly
depend on their union of essence. But the true God, on the sole ground
that He is not an object of sense, is incapable of being compared with
those false deities which are cognizable to sight and sense (to sense
indeed is sufficient); for this amounts to a clear statement of the
difference between an obscure proof and a manifest one. Now, since the
elements are obvious to all, (and) since God, on the contrary, is
visible to none, how will it be in your power from that part <span
id="page_133">p. 133</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.iv-Page_133"></span>which you have not seen to pass to a
decision on the objects which you see? Since, therefore, you have not to
combine them in your perception or your reason, why do you combine them
in name with the purpose of combining them also in power?  For see how
even Zeno separates the matter of the world from God: he says that the
latter has percolated through the former, like honey through the comb.
God, therefore, and Matter are two words (and) two things. Proportioned
to the difference of the words is the diversity of the things; the
condition also of matter follows its designation. Now if matter is not
God, because its very appellation teaches us so, how can those things
which are inherent in matter—that is, the elements—be regarded as gods,
since the component members cannot possibly be heterogeneous from the
body? But what concern have I with physiological conceits? It were
better for one’s mind to ascend above the state of the world, not to
stoop down to uncertain speculations. Plato’s form for the world was
round. Its square, angular shape, such as others had conceived it to be,
he rounded off, I suppose, with compasses, from his labouring to have it
believed to be simply without a beginning. <span
id="fr_841"></span>[842](#fn_841.md) Epicurus, however, who had said, “What
is above us is nothing to us,” wished notwithstanding to have a peep at
the sky, and found the sun to be a foot in diameter.  Thus far you must
confess <span id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842.md) men were niggardly in
even celestial objects.  In process of time their ambitious conceptions
advanced, and so the sun too enlarged its disk. <span
id="fr_843"></span>[844](#fn_843.md) Accordingly, the Peripatetics marked
it out as a larger world. <span id="fr_844"></span>[845](#fn_844.md) Now,
pray tell me, what wisdom is there in this hankering after conjectural
speculations?  What proof is afforded to us, notwithstanding the strong
confidence of its assertions, by the useless affectation of a scrupulous
curiosity, <span id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845.md) which is tricked out
with an artful show of language? It therefore served Thales of Miletus
quite right, when, star-gazing as he walked with all the eyes he had, he
had the mortification of falling <span id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846.md)
into a well, and was unmercifully twitted by an Egyptian, who said to
him, “Is it because you found nothing on earth to look at, that you
think you ought to confine your gaze to the sky?” His fall, therefore,
is a figurative picture of the philosophers; of those, I mean, <span
id="fr_847"></span>[848](#fn_847.md) who persist in applying <span
id="fr_848"></span>[849](#fn_848.md) their studies to a vain purpose, since
they indulge a stupid curiosity on natural objects, which they ought
rather (intelligently to direct) to their Creator and Governor.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p3"></span> This seems to mean: “because <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p3.1"></span>θέειν</span> has also
the sense of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p3.2"></span>σείεσθαι</span> (motion as well as
progression).”
