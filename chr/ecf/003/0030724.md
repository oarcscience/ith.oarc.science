<span id="vi.iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Very Simplicity of God’s
Means of Working, a Stumbling-Block to the Carnal Mind.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p2"></span>Well, but how great is the force of
perversity for *so* shaking the faith or entirely preventing its
reception, that it impugns it on the very principles of which *the
faith* consists! There is absolutely nothing which makes men’s minds
more obdurate than the simplicity of the divine works which are visible
in the *act*, when compared with the grandeur which is promised thereto
in the *effect*; so that from the very fact, that with so great
simplicity, without pomp, without any considerable novelty of
preparation, finally, without expense, a man is dipped in water, and
amid the utterance of some few words, is sprinkled, and then rises
again, not much (or not at all) the cleaner, the consequent attainment
of eternity <span id="fr_8545"></span>[8546](#fn_8545) is esteemed the
more incredible. I am a deceiver if, on the contrary, it is not from
their circumstance, and preparation, and expense, that *idols*’
solemnities or mysteries get their credit and authority built up. Oh,
miserable incredulity, which quite deniest to God His own properties,
simplicity and power! What then?  Is it not wonderful, too, that death
should be washed away by bathing? But it is the more to be believed if
the wonderfulness be the reason why it is *not* believed. For what does
it behove divine works to be in their quality, except that they be above
all wonder? <span id="fr_8546"></span>[8547](#fn_8546) We also ourselves
wonder, but it is *because* we believe. Incredulity, on the other hand,
wonders, but does *not* believe: for the simple *acts* it wonders at, as
if they were vain; the grand *results*, as if they were impossible. And
grant that it be just as you think <span
id="fr_8547"></span>[8548](#fn_8547) sufficient to meet each point is
the divine declaration which has forerun: “The foolish things of the
world hath God elected to confound its wisdom;” <span
id="fr_8548"></span>[8549](#fn_8548) and, “The things very difficult
with men are easy with God.” <span id="fr_8549"></span>[8550](#fn_8549)
For if God is wise and powerful (which even they who pass Him by do not
deny), it is with good reason that He lays the material causes of His
own operation in the <span id="page_670">p. 670</span> <span
id="vi.iii.ii-Page_670"></span>contraries of wisdom and of power, that
is, in foolishness and impossibility; since every virtue receives its
cause from those things by which it is called forth.
