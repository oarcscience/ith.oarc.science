<span id="v.viii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Scripture Phrases and
Passages Clearly Assert “The Resurrection of the Dead.”  The Force of
This Very Phrase Explained as Indicating the Prominent Place of the
Flesh in the General Resurrection.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xviii-p2"></span>Thus far it has been my object by
prefatory remarks to lay a foundation for the defence of all the
Scriptures which promise a resurrection of the flesh. Now, inasmuch as
*this verity* is supported by so many just and reasonable
considerations—I mean the dignity of the flesh itself, <span
id="fr_7380"></span>[7381](#fn_7380) the power and might of God, <span
id="fr_7381"></span>[7382](#fn_7381) the analogous cases in which these
are displayed, <span id="fr_7382"></span>[7383](#fn_7382) as well as the
good reasons for the judgment, and the need thereof <span
id="fr_7383"></span>[7384](#fn_7383) —it will of course be only right
and proper that the Scriptures should be understood in the sense
suggested by such authoritative considerations, and not after the
conceits of the heretics, which arise from infidelity solely, because it
is deemed incredible that the flesh should be recovered from death and
restored to life; not because (such a restoration) is either
unattainable by the flesh itself, or impossible for God to effect, or
unsuitable to the *final* judgment. Incredible, no doubt, it might be,
if it had not been revealed in the word of God; <span
id="fr_7384"></span>[7385](#fn_7384) except that, even if it had not
been thus first announced by God, it might have been fairly enough
assumed, that the revelation of it had been withheld, simply because so
many strong presumptions in its favour had been already furnished.
Since, however, (the great fact) is proclaimed in so many inspired
passages, that is so far a dissuasive against understanding it in a
sense different from that which is attested by such arguments as
persuade us to its reception, even irrespective of the testimonies of
revelation. Let us see, then, first of all in what title this hope of
ours is held out to our view. <span id="fr_7385"></span>[7386](#fn_7385)
<span id="page_558">p. 558</span> <span
id="v.viii.xviii-Page_558"></span>There is, I imagine, one divine edict
which is exposed to the gaze of all men: it is “The Resurrection of the
Dead.” <span id="fr_7386"></span>[7387](#fn_7386) These words are
prompt, decisive, clear. I mean to take these very terms, discuss them,
and discover to what substance they apply. As to the word *resurrectio*,
whenever I hear of its impending over a human being, I am forced to
inquire what part of him has been destined to *fall*, since nothing can
be expected to rise again, unless it has first been prostrated. It is
only the man who is ignorant of the fact that the flesh falls by death,
that can fail to discover that it stands erect by means of life.  Nature
pronounces God’s sentence:  “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou
return.” <span id="fr_7387"></span>[7388](#fn_7387) Even the man who has
not heard the sentence, sees the fact. No death but is the ruin of our
limbs. This destiny of the body the Lord also described, when, clothed
as He was in its very substance, He said, “Destroy this temple, and in
three days I will raise it up again.” <span
id="fr_7388"></span>[7389](#fn_7388) For He showed to what belongs (the
incidents of) being destroyed, thrown down, and kept down—even to that
to which it also appertains to be lifted and raised up again; although
He was at the same time bearing about with Him “a soul that was
trembling even unto death,” <span id="fr_7389"></span>[7390](#fn_7389)
but which did not fall through death, because even the Scripture informs
us that “He spoke of His body.” <span
id="fr_7390"></span>[7391](#fn_7390) So that it is the flesh which falls
by death; and accordingly it derives its name, *cadaver*, from
*cadendo*. <span id="fr_7391"></span>[7392](#fn_7391) The soul, however,
has no trace of a *fall* in its designation, as indeed there is no
mortality in its condition. Nay it is the soul which communicates its
ruin to the body when it is breathed out of it, just as it is also
destined to raise it up again from the earth when it shall re-enter it.
That cannot fall which by its entrance raises; nor can that droop which
by its departure causes ruin. I will go further, and say that the soul
does not even fall into sleep along with the body, nor does it with its
companion even lie down in repose.  For it is agitated in dreams, and
disturbed: it might, however, rest, if it lay down; and lie down it
certainly would, if it fell.  Thus that which does not fall even into
the likeness of death, does not succumb to the reality thereof. Passing
now to the *other* word *mortuorum*, I wish you to look carefully, and
see to what substance it is applicable.  Were we to allow, under this
head, as is sometimes held by the heretics, that the soul is mortal, so
that being mortal it shall attain to a resurrection; this would afford a
presumption that the flesh also, being no less mortal, would share in
the *same* resurrection. But our present point is to derive from the
proper signification of this word an idea of the destiny which it
indicates. Now, just as the term *resurrection* is predicated of that
which falls—that is, the flesh—so will there be the same application of
the word *dead*, because what is called “the resurrection of the dead”
indicates the rising up again of that which is fallen down. We learn
this from the case of Abraham, the father of the faithful, a man who
enjoyed close intercourse with God. For when he requested of the sons of
Heth a spot to bury Sarah in, he said to them, “Give me the possession
of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead,” <span
id="fr_7392"></span>[7393](#fn_7392) —meaning, of course, her flesh; for
he could not have desired a place to bury her soul in, even if the soul
is to be deemed mortal, and even if it could bear to be described by the
word “*dead*.” Since, then, this word indicates the body, it follows
that when “the resurrection of the dead” is spoken of, it is the rising
again of *men’s* bodies that is meant.
