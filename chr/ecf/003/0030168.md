<span id="iv.viii.ii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Gods of the Mythic
Class. The Poets a Very Poor Authority in Such Matters. Homer and the
Mythic Poets. Why Irreligious.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.vii-p2"></span>But to pass to the *mythic* class of
gods, which we attributed to the poets, <span
id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880) I hardly know whether I must only seek
to put them on a par with our own *human* mediocrity, or whether they
must be affirmed to be gods, with proofs of divinity, like the African
Mopsus and the Bœotian Amphiaraus. I must now indeed but slightly touch
on this class, of which a fuller view will be taken in the proper
place. <span id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881) Meanwhile, that these
were only human beings, is clear from the fact that you do not
consistently call them gods, but heroes. Why then discuss the point?
Although divine honours had to be ascribed to dead men, it was not to
them as such, of course. Look at your own practice, when with similar
excess of presumption you sully heaven with the sepulchres of your
kings: is it not such as are illustrious for justice, virtue, piety, and
every excellence of this sort, that you honour with the blessedness of
deification, contented even to incur contempt if you forswear
yourselves <span id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882) for such characters?
And, on the other hand, do you not deprive the impious and disgraceful
of even the old prizes of human glory, tear up <span
id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883) their decrees and titles, pull down
their statues, and deface <span id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884) their
images on the current coin? Will He, however, who beholds all things,
who approves, nay, rewards the good, prostitute before all men <span
id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885) the attribute of His own inexhaustible
grace and mercy? And shall men be allowed an especial mount of care and
righteousness, that they may be wise <span
id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886) in selecting and multiplying <span
id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887) their deities? Shall attendants on
kings and princes be more pure than those who wait on the Supreme
God? <span id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888) You turn your back in
horror, indeed, on outcasts and exiles, on the poor and weak, on the
obscurely born and the low-lived; <span
id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889) but yet you honour, even by legal
sanctions, <span id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890) unchaste men,
adulterers, robbers, and parricides. Must we regard it as a subject of
ridicule or indignation, that such characters are believed to be gods
who are not fit to be men? Then, again, in this mythic class of yours
which the poets celebrate, how uncertain is your conduct as to purity of
conscience and the maintenance thereof!  For whenever we hold up to
execration the wretched, disgraceful and atrocious (examples) of your
gods, you defend them as mere fables, on the pretence of poetic licence;
whenever we volunteer a silent contempt <span
id="fr_891"></span>[892](#fn_891) of this said <span
id="fr_892"></span>[893](#fn_892) poetic *licence*, then you are not
only troubled with no horror of it, but you go so far as <span
id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893) to show it respect, and to hold it as
one of the indispensable (fine) arts; nay, <span
id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894) you carry out the studies of your
higher classes <span id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895) by its means, as
the very foundation <span id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896) of your
literature. Plato was of opinion that poets ought to be banished, as
calumniators of the gods; (he would even have) Homer himself expelled
from his republic, although, as you are aware, <span
id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897) he was the crowned head of them all.
But <span id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.vii-Page_136"></span>while you admit and retain them
thus, why should you not believe them when they disclose such things
respecting your gods? And if you do believe your poets, how is it that
you worship such gods (as they describe)?  If you worship them simply
because you do not believe the poets, why do you bestow praise on such
lying authors, without any fear of giving offence to those whose
calumniators you honour? A regard for truth <span
id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898) is not, of course, to be expected of
poets.  But when you say that they only make men into gods after their
death, do you not admit that before death the said gods were merely
human? Now what is there strange in the fact, that they who were once
men are subject to the dishonour <span id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899)
of human casualties, or crimes, or fables?  Do you not, in fact, put
faith in your poets, when it is in accordance with their
rhapsodies <span id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900) that you have
arranged in some instances your very rituals? How is it that the
priestess of Ceres is ravished, if it is not because Ceres suffered a
similar outrage? Why are the children of others sacrificed to
Saturn, <span id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901) if it is not because he
spared not his own?  Why is a male mutilated in honour of the Idæan
goddess *Cybele*, unless it be that the (unhappy) youth who was too
disdainful of her advances was castrated, owing to her vexation at his
daring to cross her love? <span id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902) Why
was not Hercules “a dainty dish” to the good ladies of Lanuvium, if it
was not for the primeval offence which women gave to him? The poets, no
doubt, are liars. Yet it is not because *of their telling us that* <span
id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903) your gods did such things when they
were human beings, nor because they predicated divine scandals <span
id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904) of a divine state, since it seemed to
you more credible that gods should exist, though not of such a
character, than that there should be such characters, although not gods.
