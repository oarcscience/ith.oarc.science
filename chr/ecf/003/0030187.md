<span id="iv.ix.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.ix.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Of the Abolition and the Abolisher
of the Old Law.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.vi-p2"></span>Therefore, since it is manifest that a
sabbath temporal was shown, and a sabbath eternal foretold; a
circumcision carnal foretold, and a circumcision spiritual
pre-indicated; a law temporal and a law eternal formally declared;
sacrifices carnal and sacrifices spiritual foreshown; it follows that,
after all these precepts had been given carnally, in time preceding, to
the people Israel, there was to supervene a time whereat the precepts of
the ancient Law and of the old ceremonies would cease, and the
promise <span id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210) of the new law, and
the recognition of spiritual sacrifices, and the promise of the New
Testament, supervene; <span id="fr_1211"></span>[1212](#fn_1211) while
the light from on high would beam upon us who were sitting in darkness,
and were being detained in the shadow of death. <span
id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212) And so there is incumbent on us a
necessity <span id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213) binding us, since
we have premised that a new law was predicted by the prophets, and that
not such as had been already given to their fathers at the time when He
led them forth from the land of Egypt, <span
id="fr_1214"></span>[1215](#fn_1214) to show and prove, on the one hand,
that that old Law has ceased, and on the other, that the promised new
law is now in operation.

<span id="iv.ix.vi-p8"></span>And, indeed, first we must inquire whether
there be expected a giver of the new law, and an heir of the new
testament, and a priest of the new sacrifices, and a purger of the new
circumcision, and an observer of the eternal sabbath, to suppress the
old law, and institute the new testament, and offer the new sacrifices,
and repress the ancient ceremonies, and suppress <span
id="fr_1215"></span>[1216](#fn_1215) the old circumcision together with
its own sabbath, <span id="fr_1216"></span>[1217](#fn_1216) and announce
the new kingdom which is not corruptible. Inquire, I say, we must,
whether this giver of the new law, observer of the spiritual sabbath,
priest of the eternal sacrifices, eternal ruler of the eternal kingdom,
be come or no: that, if he is already come, service may have to be
rendered him; if he is not yet come, he may have to be awaited, until by
his advent it be manifest that the old Law’s precepts are suppressed,
and that the beginnings of the new law ought to arise.  And, primarily,
we must lay it down that the ancient Law and the prophets could not have
ceased, unless He were come who was constantly announced, through the
same Law and through the same prophets, as to come.

be—which the context seems to forbid—“together with a sabbath of His
own:”  the Latinity is plainly incorrect.
