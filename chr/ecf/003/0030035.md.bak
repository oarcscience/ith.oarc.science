<span id="iv.iii.xxix-p2"></span>Let it be made clear, then, first of
all, if those to whom sacrifice is offered are really able to protect
either emperor or anybody else, and so adjudge us guilty of treason, if
angels and demons, spirits of most wicked nature, do any good, if the
lost save, if the condemned give liberty, if the dead (I refer to what
you know well enough) defend the living. For surely the first thing they
would look to would be the protection of their statues, and images, and
temples, which rather owe their safety, I think, to the watch kept by
Cæsar’s guards. Nay, I think the very materials of which these are made
come from Cæsar’s mines, and there is not a temple but depends on
Cæsar’s will. Yes, and many gods have felt the displeasure of the Cæsar.
It makes for my argument if they are also partakers of his favour, when
he bestows on them some gift or privilege. How shall they who are thus
in Cæsar’s power, who belong entirely to him, have Cæsar’s protection in
their hands, so that you can imagine them able to give to Cæsar what
they more readily get from him? This, then, is the ground on which we
are charged with treason against the imperial majesty, to wit, that we
do not put <span id="page_42">p. 42</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xxix-Page_42"></span>the emperors under their own
possessions; that we do not offer a mere mock service on their behalf,
as not believing their safety rests in leaden hands. But you are impious
in a high degree who look for it where it is not, who seek it from those
who have it not to give, passing by Him who has it entirely in His
power. Besides this, you persecute those who know where to seek for it,
and who, knowing where to seek for it, are able as well to secure it.
