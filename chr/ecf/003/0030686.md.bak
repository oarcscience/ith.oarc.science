<span id="v.x.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.x.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.</span>

<span id="v.x.v-p2"></span>You have therefore the will of my God. We
have cured this prick. Let us give good heed to another thrust touching
the character of His will.  It would be tedious to show that my God is
good,—a truth with which the Marcionites have now been made acquainted
by us. Meanwhile it is enough that He is called God for its being
necessary that He should be believed to be good. For if any one make the
supposition that God is evil, he will not be able to take his stand on
both the constituents thereof: he will be bound either to affirm that he
whom he has thought to be evil is not God, or that he whom he has
proclaimed to be God is good. Good, therefore, will be the will also of
him who, unless he is good, will not be God. The goodness of the thing
itself also which God has willed—of martyrdom, I mean—will show this,
because only one who is good has willed what is good. I stoutly maintain
that martyrdom is good, as required by the God by whom likewise idolatry
is forbidden and punished.  For martyrdom strives against and opposes
idolatry. But to strive against and oppose evil cannot be ought but
good. Not as if I denied that there is a rivalry in evil things with one
another, as well as in good also; but this ground for it requires a
different state of matters. For martyrdom contends with idolatry, not
from some malice which they share, but from its own kindness; for it
delivers from idolatry. Who will not proclaim that to be good which
delivers from idolatry?  What else is the opposition between idolatry
and martyrdom, than that between life and death? Life will be counted to
be martyrdom as much as idolatry to be death. He who will call life an
evil, has death to speak of as a good. This frowardness also appertains
to men,—to discard what is wholesome, to accept what is baleful, to
avoid all dangerous cures, or, in short, to be eager to die rather than
to be healed. For they are many who flee from the aid of physic also,
many in folly, many from fear and false modesty. And the healing art has
manifestly an apparent cruelty, by reason of the lancet, and of the
burning iron, and of the great heat of the mustard; yet to be cut and
burned, and pulled and bitten, is not on that account an evil, for it
occasions helpful pains; nor will it be refused merely because it
afflicts, but because it afflicts inevitably will it be applied.  The
good accruing is the apology for the frightfulness of the work. In
short, that man who is howling and groaning and bellowing in the hands
of a physician will presently load the same hands with a fee, and
proclaim that they are the best operators, and no longer affirm that
they are cruel. Thus martyrdoms also rage furiously, but for salvation.
God also will be at liberty to heal for everlasting life by means of
fires and swords, and all that is painful. But you will admire the
physician at least even in that respect, that for the most part he
employs like properties in the cures to counteract the properties of the
diseases, when he aids, as it were, the wrong way, succouring by means
of those things to which the affliction is owing. For he both checks
heat by heat, by laying on a greater load; and subdues inflammation by
leaving thirst unappeased, by tormenting rather; and contracts the
superabundance of <span id="page_638">p. 638</span> <span
id="v.x.v-Page_638"></span>bile by every bitter little draught, and
stops hemorrhage by opening a veinlet in addition. But you will think
that God must be found fault with, and that for being jealous, if He has
chosen to contend with a disease and to do good by imitating the malady,
to destroy death by death, to dissipate killing by killing, to dispel
tortures by tortures, to disperse <span
id="fr_8250"></span>[8251](#fn_8250.md) punishments by punishments, to
bestow life by withdrawing it, to aid the flesh by injuring it, to
preserve the soul by snatching it away. The wrongheadedness, as you deem
it to be, is reasonableness; what you count cruelty is kindness. Thus,
seeing God by brief (sufferings) effects cures for eternity, extol your
God for your prosperity; you have fallen into His hands, but have
happily fallen.  He also fell into your sicknesses.  Man always first
provides employment for the physician; in short, he has brought upon
himself the danger of death.  He had received from his own Lord, as from
a physician, the salutary enough rule to live according to the law, that
he should eat of all indeed (that the garden produced) and should
refrain from only one little tree which in the meantime the Physician
Himself knew as a perilous one. He gave ear to him whom he preferred,
and broke through self-restraint. He ate what was forbidden, and,
surfeited by the trespass, suffered indigestion tending to death; he
certainly richly deserving to lose his life altogether who wished to do
so. But the inflamed tumour due to the trespass having been endured
until in due time the medicine might be mixed, the Lord gradually
prepared the means of healing—all the rules of faith, they also bearing
a resemblance to (the causes of) the ailment, seeing they annul the word
of death by the word of life, and diminish the trespass-listening by a
listening of allegiance. Thus, even when that Physician commands one to
die, He drives out the lethargy of death. Why does man show reluctance
to suffer now from a cure, what he was not reluctant then to suffer from
a disorder? Does he dislike being killed for salvation, who did not
dislike being killed for destruction?—Will he feel squeamish with
reference to the counter poison, who gaped for the poison?
