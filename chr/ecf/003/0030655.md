<span id="v.ix.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Though the Son or Word of God
Emanates from the Father, He is Not, Like the Emanations of Valentinus,
Separable from the Father.  Nor is the Holy Ghost Separable from Either.
Illustrations from Nature.</span>

<span id="v.ix.viii-p2"></span>If any man from this shall think that I
am introducing some <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ix.viii-p2.1"></span>προβολή</span>—that is to say, some
prolation <span id="fr_7845"></span>[7846](#fn_7845) of one thing out of
another, as Valentinus does when he sets forth Æon from Æon, one after
another—then this is my first reply to you: Truth must not therefore
refrain from the use of such a term, and its reality and meaning,
because heresy also employs it. The fact is, heresy has rather taken it
from Truth, in order to mould it into its own coun<span id="page_603">p.
603</span> <span id="v.ix.viii-Page_603"></span>terfeit. Was the Word of
God put forth or not? Here take your stand with me, and flinch not. If
He was put forth, then acknowledge that the true doctrine has a
prolation; <span id="fr_7846"></span>[7847](#fn_7846) and never mind
heresy, when in any point it mimics the truth. The question now is, in
what sense each side uses a given thing and the word which expresses it.
Valentinus divides and separates his prolations from their Author, and
places them at so great a distance from Him, that the Æon does not know
the Father:  he longs, indeed, to know Him, but cannot; nay, he is
almost swallowed up and dissolved into the rest of matter. <span
id="fr_7847"></span>[7848](#fn_7847) With us, however, the Son alone
knows the Father, <span id="fr_7848"></span>[7849](#fn_7848) and has
Himself unfolded “the Father’s bosom.” <span
id="fr_7849"></span>[7850](#fn_7849) He has also heard and seen all
things with the Father; and what He has been commanded by the Father,
that also does He speak. <span id="fr_7850"></span>[7851](#fn_7850) And
it is not His own will, but the Father’s, which He has
accomplished, <span id="fr_7851"></span>[7852](#fn_7851) which He had
known most intimately, even from the beginning. “For what man knoweth
the things which be in God, but the Spirit which is in Him?” <span
id="fr_7852"></span>[7853](#fn_7852) But the Word was formed by the
Spirit, and (if I may so express myself) the Spirit is the body of the
Word. The Word, therefore, is both always in the Father, as He says, “I
am in the Father;” <span id="fr_7853"></span>[7854](#fn_7853) and is
always with God, according to what is written, “And the Word was with
God;” <span id="fr_7854"></span>[7855](#fn_7854) and never separate from
the Father, or other than the Father, since “I and the Father are
one.” <span id="fr_7855"></span>[7856](#fn_7855) This will be the
prolation, taught by the truth, <span
id="fr_7856"></span>[7857](#fn_7856) the guardian of the Unity, wherein
we declare that the Son is a prolation from the Father, without being
separated from Him.  For God sent forth the Word, as the Paraclete also
declares, just as the root puts forth the tree, and the fountain the
river, and the sun the ray. <span id="fr_7857"></span>[7858](#fn_7857)
For these are <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ix.viii-p15.1"></span>προβολαί</span>, *or emanations*, of the
substances from which they proceed. I should not hesitate, indeed, to
call the tree the son or offspring of the root, and the river of the
fountain, and the ray of the sun; because every original source is a
parent, and everything which issues from the origin is an offspring. 
Much more is (this true of) the Word of God, who has actually received
as His own peculiar designation the name of *Son*. But still the tree is
not severed from the root, nor the river from the fountain, nor the ray
from the sun; nor, indeed, is the Word separated from God.  Following,
therefore, the form of these analogies, I confess that I call God and
His Word—the Father and His Son—*two*. For the root and the tree are
distinctly two things, but correlatively joined; the fountain and the
river are also two forms, but indivisible; so likewise the sun and the
ray are two forms, but coherent ones. Everything which proceeds from
something else must needs be second to that from which it proceeds,
without being on that account separated.  Where, however, there is a
second, there must be two; and where there is a third, there must be
three. Now the Spirit indeed is third from God and the Son; just as the
fruit of the tree is third from the root, or as the stream out of the
river is third from the fountain, or as the apex of the ray is third
from the sun. Nothing, however, is alien from that original source
whence it derives its own properties.  In like manner the Trinity,
flowing down from the Father through intertwined and connected steps,
does not at all disturb the *Monarchy*, <span
id="fr_7858"></span>[7859](#fn_7858) whilst it at the same time guards
the state of the *Economy*. <span id="fr_7859"></span>[7860](#fn_7859)

<span id="v.ix.viii-p3"></span> “The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ix.viii-p3.1"></span>προβολή</span> properly means anything which
proceeds or is sent forth from the substance of another, as the fruit of
a tree or the rays of the sun. In Latin, it is translated by *prolatio*,
*emissio*, or *editio*, or what we now express by the word
*development*. In Tertullian’s time, Valentinus had given the term a
material signification.  Tertullian, therefore, has to apologize for
using it, when writing against Praxeas, the forerunner of the
Sabellians” (Newman’s *Arians*, ii. 4; reprint, p. 101).
