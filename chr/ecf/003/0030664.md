<span id="v.ix.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Sundry August Titles,
Descriptive of Deity, Applied to the Son, Not, as Praxeas Would Have It,
Only to the Father.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xvii-p2"></span>They more readily supposed that the
Father acted in the Son’s name, than that the Son acted in the Father’s;
although the Lord says Himself, “I am come in my Father’s name;” <span
id="fr_7978"></span>[7979](#fn_7978.md) and even to the Father He declares,
“I have manifested Thy name unto these <span id="page_613">p. 613</span>
<span id="v.ix.xvii-Page_613"></span>men;” <span
id="fr_7979"></span>[7980](#fn_7979.md) whilst the Scripture likewise says,
“Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,” <span
id="fr_7980"></span>[7981](#fn_7980.md) that is to say, the Son in the
Father’s name.  And as for the Father’s names, God Almighty, the Most
High, the Lord of hosts, the King of Israel, the “One that is,” we say
(for so much do the Scriptures teach us) that they belonged suitably to
the Son also, and that the Son came under these designations, and has
always acted in them, and has thus manifested them in Himself to men.
“All things,” says He, “which the Father hath are mine.” <span
id="fr_7981"></span>[7982](#fn_7981.md) Then why not His names also? When,
therefore, you read of Almighty God, and the Most High, and the God of
hosts, and the King of Israel, the “One that is,” consider whether the
Son also be not indicated by these designations, who in His own right is
God Almighty, in that He is the Word of Almighty God, and has received
power over all; is the Most High, in that He is “exalted at the right
hand of God,” as Peter declares in the Acts; <span
id="fr_7982"></span>[7983](#fn_7982.md) is the Lord of hosts, because all
things are by the Father made subject to Him; is the King of Israel
because to Him has especially been committed the destiny of that nation;
and is likewise “the One that is,” because there are many who are called
Sons, but *are not*. As to the point maintained by them, that the name
of Christ belongs also to the Father, they shall hear (what I have to
say) in the proper place. Meanwhile, let this be my immediate answer to
the argument which they adduce from the Revelation of John: “I am the
Lord which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty;” <span
id="fr_7983"></span>[7984](#fn_7983.md) and from all other passages which
in their opinion make the designation of Almighty God unsuitable to the
Son. As if, indeed, *He which is to come* were not almighty; whereas
even the Son of the Almighty is as much almighty as the Son of God is
God.
