<span id="vi.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Third Clause.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p2"></span>According to this model, <span
id="fr_8782"></span>[8783](#fn_8782) we subjoin, “Thy will be done in
the heavens and on the earth;” <span
id="fr_8783"></span>[8784](#fn_8783) not that there is some power
withstanding <span id="fr_8784"></span>[8785](#fn_8784) to prevent God’s
will being done, and we pray for Him the successful achievement of His
will; but we pray for His will to be done *in all*.  For, by figurative
interpretation of *flesh* and *spirit, we* are “heaven” and “earth;”
albeit, even if it is to be understood simply, still the sense of the
petition is the same, that *in us* God’s will be done on earth, to make
it possible, namely, for it to be done also in the heavens. What,
moreover, *does* God will, but that we should walk according to His
Discipline? We make petition, then, that He supply us with the substance
of His will, and the capacity to do it, that we may be saved both in the
heavens and on earth; because the sum of His will is the salvation of
them whom He has adopted. There is, too, that will of God which the Lord
accomplished in preaching, in working, in enduring: for if He Himself
proclaimed that He did not His own, but the Father’s will, without doubt
those things which He used to do *were* the Father’s will; <span
id="fr_8785"></span>[8786](#fn_8785) unto which things, as unto
exemplars, we are now provoked; <span
id="fr_8786"></span>[8787](#fn_8786) to preach, to work, to endure even
<span id="page_683">p. 683</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iv-Page_683"></span>unto death. And we *need* the will of God,
that we may be able to fulfil these duties. Again, in saying, “Thy will
be done,” we are even wishing well to ourselves, in so far that there is
nothing of *evil* in the will of God; even if, proportionably to each
one’s deserts, somewhat other <span id="fr_8787"></span>[8788](#fn_8787)
is imposed on us. So by this expression we premonish our own selves unto
patience.  The Lord also, when He had wished to demonstrate to us, even
in His own flesh, the flesh’s infirmity, by the reality of suffering,
said, “Father, remove this Thy cup;” and remembering Himself, *added*,
“save that not my will, but Thine be done.” <span
id="fr_8788"></span>[8789](#fn_8788) Himself *was* the Will and the
Power of the Father:  and yet, for the demonstration of the patience
which was due, He gave Himself up *to* the Father’s Will.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p3"></span> Mr. Dodgson renders, “next to this
clause;” but the “*forma*” referred to seems, by what Tertullian
proceeds to add, to be what he had said above, “not that it becomes us
to wish God well,” etc.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p4"></span> We learn from this and other places, that
the comparative adverb was wanting in some ancient *formulæ* of the
Lord’s Prayer. \[See Routh, *Opuscula* I. p. 178.\]
