<span id="v.viii.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII.—Sundry Passages in the
Great Chapter of the Resurrection of the Dead Explained in Defence of
Our Doctrine.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xlviii-p2"></span>But “flesh and blood,” you say,
“cannot inherit the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_7621"></span>[7622](#fn_7621.md) We are quite aware that this too is
written; but although our opponents place it in the front of the battle,
we have intentionally reserved the objection until now, in order that we
may in our last assault overthrow it, after we have removed out of the
way all the questions which are auxiliary to it.  However, they must
contrive to recall to their mind even now our preceding *arguments*, in
order that the occasion which originally suggested this passage may
assist our judgment in arriving at its meaning. The apostle, as I take
it, having set forth for the Corinthians the details of their church
discipline, had summed up the substance of his own gospel, and of their
belief in an exposition of the Lord’s death and resurrection, for the
purpose of deducing therefrom the rule of our hope, and the groundwork
thereof. Accordingly he subjoins this statement: “Now if Christ be
preached that He rose from the dead, how say some among you that there
is no resurrection of the dead? If there be no *resurrection of the
dead*, then Christ is not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our
preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false
witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that He raised up
Christ, whom He raised not up, *if so be that the dead rise not*. For if
the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not
raised, your faith is vain, because ye are yet in your sins, and they
which have fallen asleep in Christ are perished.” <span
id="fr_7622"></span>[7623](#fn_7622.md) Now, what is the point which he
evidently labours hard to make us believe throughout this passage? The
resurrection of the dead, you say, which was denied: he certainly wished
it to be believed on the strength of the example which he adduced—the
Lord’s resurrection. Certainly, you say. Well now, is an example
borrowed from different circumstances, or from like ones?  From like
ones, by all means, is your answer. How then did Christ rise again? In
the flesh, or not? No doubt, since you are told that He “died according
to the Scriptures,” <span id="fr_7623"></span>[7624](#fn_7623.md) and “that
He was buried *according to the Scriptures*,” <span
id="fr_7624"></span>[7625](#fn_7624.md) no otherwise than in the flesh, you
will also allow that it was in the flesh that He was raised from the
dead. For the very same body which fell in death, and which lay in the
sepulchre, did also rise again; (and it was) not so much Christ in the
flesh, as the flesh in Christ. If, therefore, we are to rise again after
the example of Christ, who rose in the flesh, we shall certainly not
rise according to that example, unless we also shall ourselves rise
again in the flesh. “For,” he says, “since by man came death, by man
came also the resurrection of the dead.” <span
id="fr_7625"></span>[7626](#fn_7625) (This he says.md) in order, on the one
hand, to distinguish the two authors—Adam of death, Christ of
resurrection; and, on the other hand, to make the resurrection operate
on the same substance as the death, by comparing the authors themselves
under the designation *man*.  For if “as in Adam all die, even so in
Christ shall all be made alive,” <span
id="fr_7626"></span>[7627](#fn_7626.md) their vivification in Christ must
be in the flesh, since it is in the flesh that arises their death in
Adam. “But every man in his own order,” <span
id="fr_7627"></span>[7628](#fn_7627.md) because of course *it will be* also
*every man* in his own body. For the *order* will be arranged severally,
on account of the individual merits. Now, as the merits must be ascribed
to the body, it must needs follow that the order also should be arranged
in respect of the bodies, that it may be in relation to their merits.
But inasmuch as “some are also baptized for the dead,” <span
id="fr_7628"></span>[7629](#fn_7628.md) we will see whether there be a good
reason for this. Now it is certain that they adopted this (practice)
with such a presumption as made them suppose that the vicarious baptism
(in question) would be beneficial to the flesh of another in
anticipation of the resurrection; for unless it were a bodily
*resur*<span id="page_582">p. 582</span> <span
id="v.viii.xlviii-Page_582"></span>*rection*, there would be no pledge
secured by this process of a corporeal baptism. “Why are they then
baptized for the dead,” <span id="fr_7629"></span>[7630](#fn_7629.md) he
asks, unless the bodies rise again which are thus baptized? For it is
not the soul which is sanctified by the baptismal bath: <span
id="fr_7630"></span>[7631](#fn_7630.md) its sanctification comes from the
“answer.” <span id="fr_7631"></span>[7632](#fn_7631.md) “And why,” he
inquires, “stand we in jeopardy every hour?” <span
id="fr_7632"></span>[7633](#fn_7632.md) —meaning, of course, through the
flesh. “I die daily,” <span id="fr_7633"></span>[7634](#fn_7633.md) (says
he); that is, undoubtedly, in the perils of the body, in which “he even
fought with beasts at Ephesus,” <span
id="fr_7634"></span>[7635](#fn_7634.md) —even with those beasts which
caused him such peril and trouble in Asia, to which he alludes in his
second epistle to the same church *of Corinth*: “For we would not,
brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia,
that we were pressed above measure, above strength, insomuch that we
despaired even of life.” <span id="fr_7635"></span>[7636](#fn_7635.md) Now,
if I mistake not, he enumerates all these particulars in order that in
his unwillingness to have his conflicts in the flesh supposed to be
useless, he may induce an unfaltering belief in the resurrection of the
flesh. For useless must that conflict be deemed (which is sustained in a
body) for which no resurrection is in prospect. “But some man will say,
How are the dead to be raised?  And with what body will they
come?” <span id="fr_7636"></span>[7637](#fn_7636.md) Now here he discusses
the qualities of bodies, whether it be the very same, or different ones,
which men are to resume. Since, however, such a question as this must be
regarded as a subsequent one, it will in passing be enough for us that
the resurrection is determined to be a bodily one even from this, that
it is about the quality of *bodies* that the inquiry arises.
