<span id="v.ix.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—The Distinction of the Father
and the Son, Thus Established, He Now Proves the Distinction of the Two
Natures, Which Were, Without Confusion, United in the Person of the Son.
The Subterfuges of Praxeas Thus Exposed.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xxvii-p2"></span>But why should I linger over matters
which are so evident, when I ought to be attacking points on which they
seek to obscure the plainest proof? For, confuted on all sides on the
distinction between the Father and the Son, which we maintain without
destroying their inseparable union—as (by the examples) of the sun and
the ray, and the fountain and the river—yet, by help of (their conceit)
an indivisible number, (with issues) of two and three, they endeavour to
interpret this *distinction* in a way which shall nevertheless tally
with their own opinions: so that, all in one Person, they distinguish
two, Father and Son, understanding the Son to be flesh, that is man,
that is Jesus; and the Father to be spirit, that is God, that is Christ.
Thus they, while contending that the Father and the Son are one and the
same, do in fact begin by dividing them rather than uniting them. For if
Jesus is one, and Christ is another, then the Son will be different from
the Father, because the Son is Jesus, and the Father is Christ.  Such a
*monarchy* as this they learnt, I suppose, in the school of Valentinus,
making two—Jesus and Christ. But this conception of theirs has been, in
fact, already confuted in what we have previously advanced, because the
Word of God or the Spirit of God is also called the power of the
Highest, whom they make the Father; whereas these relations <span
id="fr_8149"></span>[8150](#fn_8149.md) are not themselves the same as He
whose relations they are said to be, but they proceed from Him and
appertain to Him.  However, another refutation awaits them on this point
of their heresy. See, say they, it was announced by the angel:
“Therefore that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called
the Son of God.” <span id="fr_8150"></span>[8151](#fn_8150.md) Therefore,
(they argue,) as it was the flesh that was born, it must be the flesh
that is the Son of God. Nay, (I answer,) this is spoken concerning the
Spirit of God. For it was certainly of the Holy Spirit that the virgin
conceived; and that which He conceived, she brought forth. That,
therefore, had to be born which was conceived and was to be brought
forth; that is to say, the Spirit, whose “name should be called Emmanuel
which, being interpreted, is, God with us.” <span
id="fr_8151"></span>[8152](#fn_8151.md) Besides, the flesh is not God, so
that it could not have been said concerning it, “That Holy Thing shall
be called the Son of God,” but only that Divine Being who was born in
the flesh, of whom the psalm also says, “Since God became man in the
midst of it, and established it by the will of the Father.” <span
id="fr_8152"></span>[8153](#fn_8152.md) Now what Divine Person was born in
it? The Word, and the Spirit which became incarnate with the Word by the
will of the Father. The Word, therefore, is incarnate; and this must be
the point of our inquiry: How the Word became flesh,—whether it was by
having been transfigured, as it were, in the flesh, or by having really
clothed Himself in flesh. Certainly it was by a real clothing of Himself
in flesh. For the rest, we must needs believe God to be unchangeable,
and incapable of form, as being eternal. But transfiguration is the
destruction of that which previously existed.  For whatsoever is
transfigured into some other thing ceases to be that which it had been,
and begins to be that which it previously was not. God, however, neither
ceases to be what He was, nor can He be any other thing than what He is.
The Word is God, and “the Word of the Lord remaineth for ever,”—even by
holding on unchangeably in His own proper form. Now, if He admits not of
being transfigured, it must follow that He be understood in this sense
to have become flesh, when He comes to be in the flesh, and is
manifested, and is seen, and is handled by means of the flesh; since all
the other points likewise require to be thus understood. For if the Word
became flesh by a transfiguration and change of substance, it follows at
<span id="page_624">p. 624</span> <span
id="v.ix.xxvii-Page_624"></span>once that Jesus must be a substance
compounded of <span id="fr_8153"></span>[8154](#fn_8153.md) two
substances—of flesh and spirit,—a kind of mixture, like *electrum*,
composed of gold and silver; and it begins to be neither gold (that is
to say, spirit) nor silver (that is to say, flesh),—the one being
changed by the other, and a third substance produced. Jesus, therefore,
cannot at this rate be God for He has ceased to be the Word, which was
made flesh; nor can He be Man incarnate for He is not properly flesh,
and it was flesh which the Word became. Being compounded, therefore, of
both, He actually is neither; He is rather some third substance, very
different from either. But the truth is, we find that He is expressly
set forth as both God and Man; the very psalm which we have quoted
intimating (of the flesh), that “God became Man in the midst of it, He
therefore established it by the will of the Father,”—certainly in all
respects as the Son of God and the Son of Man, being God and Man,
differing no doubt according to each substance in its own especial
property, inasmuch as the Word is nothing else but God, and the flesh
nothing else but Man. Thus does the apostle also teach respecting His
two substances, saying, “who was made of the seed of David;” <span
id="fr_8154"></span>[8155](#fn_8154.md) in which words He will be Man and
Son of Man.  “Who was declared to be the Son of God, according to the
Spirit;” <span id="fr_8155"></span>[8156](#fn_8155.md) in which words He
will be God, and the Word—the Son of God. We see plainly the twofold
state, which is not confounded, but conjoined in One Person—Jesus, God
and Man. Concerning Christ, indeed, I defer what I have to say. <span
id="fr_8156"></span>[8157](#fn_8156) (I remark here.md), that the property
of each nature is so wholly preserved, that the Spirit <span
id="fr_8157"></span>[8158](#fn_8157.md) on the one hand did all things in
Jesus suitable to Itself, such as miracles, and mighty deeds, and
wonders; and the Flesh, on the other hand, exhibited the affections
which belong to it. It was hungry under the devil’s temptation, thirsty
with the Samaritan woman, wept over Lazarus, was troubled even unto
death, and at last actually died. If, however, it was only a *tertium
quid*, some composite essence formed out of the Two substances, like the
*electrum* (which we have mentioned), there would be no distinct proofs
apparent of either nature. But by a transfer of functions, the Spirit
would have done things to be done by the Flesh, and the Flesh such as
are effected by the Spirit; or else such things as are suited neither to
the Flesh nor to the Spirit, but confusedly of some third character. Nay
more, on this supposition, either the Word underwent death, or the flesh
did not die, if so be the Word was converted into flesh; because either
the flesh was immortal, or the Word was mortal. Forasmuch, however, as
the two substances acted distinctly, each in its own character, there
necessarily accrued to them severally their own operations, and their
own issues. Learn then, together with Nicodemus, that “that which is
born in the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is
Spirit.” <span id="fr_8158"></span>[8159](#fn_8158.md) Neither the flesh
becomes Spirit, nor the Spirit flesh. In one *Person* they no doubt are
well able to be co-existent. Of them Jesus consists—Man, of the flesh;
of the Spirit, God—and the angel designated Him as “the Son of
God,” <span id="fr_8159"></span>[8160](#fn_8159.md) in respect of that
nature, in which He was Spirit, reserving for the flesh the appellation
“Son of Man.” In like manner, again, the apostle calls Him “the Mediator
between God and Men,” <span id="fr_8160"></span>[8161](#fn_8160.md) and so
affirmed His participation of both substances. Now, to end the matter,
will you, who interpret the Son of God to be flesh, be so good as to
show us what the Son of Man is? Will He then, I want to know, be the
Spirit? But you insist upon it that the Father Himself is the Spirit, on
the ground that “God is a Spirit,” just as if we did not read also that
there is “the Spirit of God;” in the same manner as we find that as “the
Word was God,” so also there is “the Word of God.”
