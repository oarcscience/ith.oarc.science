<span id="iv.iv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Connection Between Covetousness
and Idolatry. Certain Trades, However Gainful, to Be Avoided.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p2"></span>If we think over the rest of faults,
tracing them from their generations, let us begin with covetousness, “a
root of all evils,” <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229) wherewith,
indeed, some having been ensnared, “have suffered shipwreck about
faith.” <span id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230) Albeit covetousness is
by the same apostle called *idolatry*. <span
id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231) In the next place *proceeding to*
mendacity, the minister of covetousness (of false swearing I am silent,
since even swearing is not lawful <span
id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232) )—is *trade* adapted for a servant of
God? But, covetousness apart, what is the motive for acquiring? When the
motive for acquiring ceases, there will be no necessity for trading.
Grant now that there be some righteousness in business, secure from the
duty of watchfulness against covetousness and mendacity; I take it that
that trade which pertains to the very soul and spirit of idols, which
pampers every demon, falls under the charge of idolatry. Rather, is not
that the *principal* idolatry? If the selfsame
merchandises—frankincense, I mean, and all other foreign
productions—used as sacrifice to idols, are of use likewise to men for
medicinal ointments, to us *Christians* also, over and above, for
solaces of sepulture, let them see to it. At all events, while the
pomps, while the priesthoods, while the sacrifices of idols, are
furnished by dangers, by losses, by inconveniences, by cogitations, by
runnings to and fro, or trades, what else are you demonstrated to be but
an idols’ agent? Let none contend that, in this way, exception may be
taken to *all* trades. All graver faults extend the sphere for diligence
in watchfulness proportionably to the magnitude of the danger; in order
that we may withdraw not only from the faults, but from the means
through which they have being. For although the fault be done by others,
it makes no difference if it be *by my means*. In no case ought I to be
*necessary* to another, while he is doing what to me is unlawful.  Hence
I ought to understand that care must be taken by me, lest what I am
forbidden to do be done *by my means*. In short, in another cause of no
lighter guilt I observe that fore-judgment. In that I am interdicted
from fornication, I furnish nothing of help or connivance to others for
that purpose; in that I have separated my own flesh itself from stews, I
acknowledge that I cannot exercise the trade of pandering, or keep that
kind of places for my neighbour’s behoof.  So, too, the interdiction of
murder shows me that a trainer of gladiators also is excluded from the
Church; nor will any one fail to be the means of doing what he
subministers to another to do. Behold, here is a more kindred
fore-judgment: if a purveyor of the public victims come over to the
faith, will you permit him to remain permanently in that trade? or if
one who is already a believer shall have undertaken that business, will
you think that he is to be retained in the Church?  No, I take it;
unless any one will dissemble in the case of a frankincense-seller too.
In sooth, the agency of *blood* pertains to some, that of *odours* to
others. If, before idols were in the world, idolatry, hitherto
shapeless, used to be transacted by these wares; if, even now, the work
of idolatry is perpetrated, for the most part, without the idol, by
burnings of odours; the frankincense-seller is a something even more
serviceable even toward demons, for idolatry is more easily carried on
without the idol, than without the ware of the
frankincense-seller. <span id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233) Let us
interrogate thoroughly <span id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span
id="iv.iv.xi-Page_68"></span>the conscience of the faith itself. With
what mouth will a Christian frankincense-seller, if he shall pass
through temples, with what mouth will he spit down upon and blow out the
smoking altars, for which himself has made provision? With what
consistency will he exorcise his own foster-children, <span
id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234) to whom he affords his own house as
store-room?  Indeed, if he shall have ejected a demon, <span
id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235) let *him* not congratulate himself on
his faith, for he has not ejected an *enemy*; he ought to have had his
prayer easily granted by one whom he is daily feeding. <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236) No art, then, no profession, no trade,
which administers either to equipping or forming idols, can be free from
the title of idolatry; unless we interpret idolatry to be altogether
something else than the service of idol-tendence.
