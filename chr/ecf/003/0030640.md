<span id="v.viii.lviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVIII.—From This Perfection of Our
Restored Bodies Will Flow the Consciousness of Undisturbed Joy and
Peace.</span>

<span id="v.viii.lviii-p2"></span>“Everlasting joy,” says Isaiah, “shall
be upon their heads.” <span id="fr_7727"></span>[7728](#fn_7727) Well,
there is nothing eternal until after the resurrection. “And sorrow and
sighing,” continues he, “shall flee away.” <span
id="fr_7728"></span>[7729](#fn_7728) The angel echoes the same to John:
“And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;” <span
id="fr_7729"></span>[7730](#fn_7729) from the same eyes indeed which had
formerly wept, and which might weep again, if the loving-kindness of God
did not dry up every fountain of tears. And again:  “God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death,” <span
id="fr_7730"></span>[7731](#fn_7730) and therefore no more corruption,
it being chased away by incorruption, even as death is by immortality.
If sorrow, and mourning, and sighing, and death itself, assail us from
the afflictions both of soul and body, how shall they be removed, except
by the cessation of their causes, that is to say, the afflictions of
flesh and soul? where will you find adversities in the presence of God?
where, incursions of an enemy in the bosom of Christ? where, attacks of
the devil in the face of the Holy Spirit?—now that the devil himself and
his angels are “cast into the lake of fire.” <span
id="fr_7731"></span>[7732](#fn_7731) Where now is necessity, and what
they call fortune or fate? What plague awaits the redeemed from death,
after their eternal pardon? What wrath is there for the reconciled,
after grace? What weakness, after their <span id="page_591">p.
591</span> <span id="v.viii.lviii-Page_591"></span>renewed strength?
What risk and danger, after their salvation? That the raiment and shoes
of the children of Israel remained unworn and fresh for the space of
forty years; <span id="fr_7732"></span>[7733](#fn_7732) that in their
very persons the exact point <span id="fr_7733"></span>[7734](#fn_7733)
of convenience and propriety checked the rank growth of their nails and
hair, so that any excess herein might not be attributed to indecency;
that the fires of Babylon injured not either the mitres or the trousers
of the three brethren, however foreign such dress might be to the
Jews; <span id="fr_7734"></span>[7735](#fn_7734) that Jonah was
swallowed by the monster of the deep, in whose belly whole ships were
devoured, and after three days was vomited out again safe and
sound; <span id="fr_7735"></span>[7736](#fn_7735) that Enoch and Elias,
who even now, without experiencing a resurrection (because they have not
even encountered death), are learning to the full what it is for the
flesh to be exempted from all humiliation, and all loss, and all injury,
and all disgrace—translated as they have been from this world, and from
this very cause already candidates for everlasting life; <span
id="fr_7736"></span>[7737](#fn_7736) —to what faith do these notable
facts bear witness, if not to that which ought to inspire in us the
belief that they are proofs and documents of our own future integrity
*and perfect resurrection*? For, to borrow the apostle’s phrase, these
were “figures of ourselves;” <span id="fr_7737"></span>[7738](#fn_7737)
and they are written that we may believe both that the Lord is more
powerful than all natural laws about the body, and that He shows Himself
the preserver of the flesh the more emphatically, in that He has
preserved for it its very clothes and shoes.
