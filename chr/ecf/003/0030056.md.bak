<span id="iv.iii.l-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter L.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.l-p2"></span>In that case, you say, why do you complain
of our persecutions? You ought rather to be grateful to us for giving
you the sufferings you want. Well, it is quite true that it is our
desire to suffer, but it is in the way that the soldier longs for war.
No one indeed suffers willingly, since suffering necessarily implies
fear and danger.  Yet the man who objected to the conflict, both fights
with all his strength, and when victorious, he rejoices in the battle,
because he reaps from it glory and spoil. It is our battle to be
summoned to your tribunals that there, under fear of execution, we may
battle for the truth. But the day is won when the object of the struggle
is gained.  This victory of ours gives us the glory of pleasing God, and
the spoil of life eternal. But we are overcome. Yes, when we have
obtained our wishes. Therefore we conquer in dying; <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) we go forth victorious at the very
time we are subdued. Call us, if you like, *Sarmenticii* and *Semaxii*,
because, bound to a half-axle stake, <span id="page_55">p. 55</span>
<span id="iv.iii.l-Page_55"></span>we are burned in a circle-heap of
fagots. This is the attitude in which we conquer, it is our
victory-robe, it is for us a sort of triumphal car. Naturally enough,
therefore, we do not please the vanquished; on account of this, indeed,
we are counted a desperate, reckless race. But the very desperation and
recklessness you object to in us, among yourselves lift high the
standard of virtue in the cause of glory and of fame. Mucius of his own
will left his right hand on the altar: what sublimity of mind!
Empedocles gave his whole body at Catana to the fires of Ætna: what
mental resolution! A certain foundress of Carthage gave herself away in
second marriage to the funeral pile: what a noble witness of her
chastity! Regulus, not wishing that his one life should count for the
lives of many enemies, endured these crosses over all his frame: how
brave a man—even in captivity a conqueror! Anaxarchus, when he was being
beaten to death by a barley-pounder, cried out, “Beat on, beat on at the
case of Anaxarchus; no stroke falls on Anaxarchus himself.” O
magnanimity of the philosopher, who even in such an end had jokes upon
his lips! I omit all reference to those who with their own sword, or
with any other milder form of death, have bargained for glory.  Nay, see
how even torture contests are crowned by you. The Athenian courtezan,
having wearied out the executioner, at last bit off her tongue and spat
it in the face of the raging tyrant, that she might at the same time
spit away her power of speech, nor be longer able to confess her
fellow-conspirators, if even overcome, that might be her inclination.
Zeno the Eleatic, when he was asked by Dionysius what good philosophy
did, on answering that it gave contempt of death, was all unquailing,
given over to the tyrant’s scourge, and sealed his opinion even to the
death. We all know how the Spartan lash, applied with the utmost cruelty
under the very eyes of friends encouraging, confers on those who bear it
honor proportionate to the blood which the young men shed. O glory
legitimate, because it is human, for whose sake it is counted neither
reckless foolhardiness, nor desperate obstinacy, to despise death itself
and all sorts of savage treatment; for whose sake you may for your
native place, for the empire, for friendship, endure all you are
forbidden to do for God!  And you cast statues in honour of persons such
as these, and you put inscriptions upon images, and cut out epitaphs on
tombs, that their names may never perish. In so far you can by your
monuments, you yourselves afford a sort of resurrection to the dead. Yet
he who expects the true resurrection from God, is insane, if for God he
suffers!  But go zealously on, good presidents, you will stand higher
with the people if you sacrifice the Christians at their wish, kill us,
torture us, condemn us, grind us to dust; your injustice is the proof
that we are innocent. Therefore God suffers that we thus suffer; for but
very lately, in condemning a Christian woman to the *leno* rather than
to the *leo* you made confession that a taint on our purity is
considered among us something more terrible than any punishment and any
death. <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) Nor does your cruelty,
however exquisite, avail you; it is rather a temptation to us.  The
oftener we are mown down by you, the more in number we grow; *the blood
of Christians is seed*. <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) Many of
your writers exhort to the courageous bearing of pain and death, as
Cicero in the *Tusculans*, as Seneca in his *Chances*, as Diogenes,
Pyrrhus, Callinicus; and yet their words do not find so many disciples
as Christians do, teachers not by words, but by their deeds. That very
obstinacy you rail against is the preceptress. For who that contemplates
it, is not excited to inquire what is at the bottom of it? who, after
inquiry, does not embrace our doctrines? and when he has embraced them,
desires not to suffer that he may become partaker of the fulness of
God’s grace, that he may obtain from God complete forgiveness, by giving
in exchange his blood? For that secures the remission of all offences.
On this account it is that we return thanks on the very spot for your
sentences. As the divine and human are ever opposed to each other, when
we are condemned by you, we are acquitted by the Highest.
