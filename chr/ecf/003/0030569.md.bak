<span id="v.vii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Christ Took Not on Him an
Angelic Nature, But the Human. It Was Men, Not Angels, Whom He Came to
Save.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xiv-p2"></span>But Christ, they say, bare <span
id="fr_7137"></span>[7138](#fn_7137) (the nature of.md) an angel. For what
reason? The same which induced Him to become man? Christ, then, was
actuated by the motive which led Him to take human nature. Man’s
salvation was the motive, the restoration of that which had perished. 
Man had perished; his recovery had become necessary. No such cause,
however, existed for Christ’s taking on Him the nature of angels. For
although there is assigned to angels also perdition in “the fire
prepared for the devil and his angels,” <span
id="fr_7138"></span>[7139](#fn_7138.md) yet a restoration is never promised
to them.  No charge about the salvation of angels did Christ ever
receive from the Father; and that which the Father neither promised nor
commanded, Christ could not have undertaken. For what object, therefore,
did He bear the angelic nature, if it were not (that He might have it)
as a powerful helper <span id="fr_7139"></span>[7140](#fn_7139.md)
wherewithal to execute the salvation of man?  <span id="page_534">p.
534</span> <span id="v.vii.xiv-Page_534"></span>The Son of God, in
sooth, was not competent alone to deliver man, whom a solitary and
single serpent had overthrown!  There is, then, no longer but one God,
but one Saviour, if there be two to contrive salvation, and one of them
in need of the other. But was it His object indeed to deliver man by an
angel? Why, then, come down to do that which He was about to expedite
with an angel’s help? If by an angel’s aid, why *come* Himself also? If
He meant to do all by Himself, why have an angel too? He has been, it is
true, called “the Angel of great counsel,” that is, a messenger, by a
term expressive of official function, not of nature. For He had to
announce to the world the mighty purpose of the Father, even that which
ordained the restoration of man.  But He is not on this account to be
regarded as an angel, as a Gabriel or a Michael. For the Lord of the
Vineyard sends even His Son to the labourers to require fruit, as well
as His servants. Yet the Son will not therefore be counted as one of the
servants because He undertook the office of a servant. I may, then, more
easily say, if such an expression is to be hazarded, <span
id="fr_7140"></span>[7141](#fn_7140.md) that the Son is actually an angel,
that is, a messenger, from the Father, than that there is an angel in
the Son.  Forasmuch, however, as it has been declared concerning the Son
Himself, “Thou hast made Him a little lower than the angels” <span
id="fr_7141"></span>[7142](#fn_7141.md) how will it appear that He put on
the nature of angels if He was made lower than the angels, having become
man, with flesh and soul as the Son of man? As “the Spirit <span
id="fr_7142"></span>[7143](#fn_7142.md) of God,” however, and “the Power of
the Highest,” <span id="fr_7143"></span>[7144](#fn_7143.md) can He be
regarded as lower than the angels,—He who is verily God, and the Son of
God? Well, but as bearing human nature, He is so far made inferior to
the angels; but as bearing angelic nature, He to the same degree loses
that inferiority. This opinion will be very suitable for Ebion, <span
id="fr_7144"></span>[7145](#fn_7144.md) who holds Jesus to be a mere man,
and nothing more than a descendant of David, and not also the Son of
God; although He is, to be sure, <span
id="fr_7145"></span>[7146](#fn_7145.md) in one respect more glorious than
the prophets, inasmuch as he declares that there was an angel in Him,
just as there was in Zechariah. Only it was never said by Christ, “And
the angel, which spake within me, said unto me.” <span
id="fr_7146"></span>[7147](#fn_7146.md) Neither, indeed, was ever used by
Christ that familiar phrase of all the prophets, “Thus saith the Lord.”
For He was Himself the Lord, who openly spake by His own authority,
prefacing His words with the formula, “Verily, verily, *I* say unto
you.” What need is there of further argument? Hear what Isaiah says in
emphatic words, “It was no angel, nor deputy, but the Lord Himself who
saved them.” <span id="fr_7147"></span>[7148](#fn_7147.md)
