id="v.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Achamoth in Love with the

Achamoth Becomes the Mother of Three Natures.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xvii-p2"></span>Then Achamoth, delivered at length from
all her evils, wonderful to tell <span

results.  For warmed with the joy of so great an escape from her unhappy
condition, and at the same time heated with the actual contemplation of
the angelic luminaries (one is ashamed) *to use such language*, (but
there is no other way of expressing one’s meaning), she during the
emotion somehow became personally inflamed with desire <span

pregnant with a spiritual conception, at the very image of which the
violence of her joyous transport, and the delight of her prurient
excitement had imbibed and impressed upon her. She at length gave birth
to an offspring, and then there arose a leash of natures, <span

material, arising from her passion; another animal, arising from her
conversion; the third spiritual, which had its origin in her
imagination.
