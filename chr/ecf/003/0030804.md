<span id="vi.vii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Of Bodily Patience.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.xiii-p2"></span>Thus far, finally, of patience simple
and uniform, and as it exists merely in the *mind*:  though in many
forms likewise I labour after it in *body*, for the purpose of “winning
the Lord;” <span id="fr_9149"></span>[9150](#fn_9149.md) inasmuch as it is
*a quality* which has been exhibited by the Lord Himself in bodily
virtue as well; if it is true that the ruling mind easily communicates
the gifts <span id="fr_9150"></span>[9151](#fn_9150.md) of the Spirit with
its *bodily* habitation. What, therefore, is the business of Patience
*in the body*? In the first place, *it is* the affliction <span
id="fr_9151"></span>[9152](#fn_9151.md) of the flesh—a victim <span
id="fr_9152"></span>[9153](#fn_9152.md) able to appease the Lord by means
of the sacrifice of humiliation—in making a libation to the Lord of
sordid <span id="fr_9153"></span>[9154](#fn_9153.md) raiment, together with
scantiness of food, content with simple diet and the pure drink of
water <span id="fr_9154"></span>[9155](#fn_9154.md) in conjoining fasts *to
all this*; in inuring herself to sackcloth and ashes.  This *bodily*
patience adds a grace to our prayers for good, a strength to our prayers
against evil; this opens the ears of Christ *our* God, <span
id="fr_9155"></span>[9156](#fn_9155.md) dissipates severity, elicits
clemency.  Thus that Babylonish king, <span
id="fr_9156"></span>[9157](#fn_9156.md) after being exiled from human form
in his seven years’ squalor and neglect, because he had offended the
Lord; by the bodily immolation of patience not only recovered his
kingdom, but—what is more to be desired by a man—made satisfaction to
God. Further, if we set down in order the higher and happier grades of
bodily patience, (we find that) it is she who is entrusted by holiness
with the care of continence of the flesh: she keeps the widow, <span
id="fr_9157"></span>[9158](#fn_9157.md) and sets on the virgin the
seal <span id="fr_9158"></span>[9159](#fn_9158.md) and raises the self-made
eunuch to the realms of heaven. <span
id="fr_9159"></span>[9160](#fn_9159.md) That which springs from a virtue of
the *mind* is perfected in the *flesh; and*, finally, by the patience of
the flesh, does battle under persecution.  If flight press hard, the
flesh wars with <span id="fr_9160"></span>[9161](#fn_9160.md) the
inconvenience of flight; if imprisonment over<span id="page_716">p.
716</span> <span id="vi.vii.xiii-Page_716"></span>take <span
id="fr_9161"></span>[9162](#fn_9161) us, the flesh (still was.md) in bonds,
the flesh in the gyve, the flesh in solitude, <span
id="fr_9162"></span>[9163](#fn_9162.md) and in that want of light, and in
that patience of the world’s misusage. <span
id="fr_9163"></span>[9164](#fn_9163.md) When, however, it is led forth unto
the final proof of happiness, <span id="fr_9164"></span>[9165](#fn_9164.md)
unto the occasion of the second baptism, <span
id="fr_9165"></span>[9166](#fn_9165.md) unto the act of ascending the
divine seat, no patience is more needed *there* than *bodily* patience.
If the “spirit is willing, but the flesh,” *without* patience,
“weak,” <span id="fr_9166"></span>[9167](#fn_9166.md) where, *save in
patience*, is the safety of the spirit, and of the flesh itself?  But
when the Lord says this about the flesh, pronouncing it “weak,” He shows
what need there is of strengthening, it—that is by patience—to
meet <span id="fr_9167"></span>[9168](#fn_9167.md) every preparation for
subverting or punishing faith; that it may bear with all constancy
stripes, fire, cross, beasts, sword; all which prophets and apostles, by
enduring, conquered!
