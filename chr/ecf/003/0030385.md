<span id="v.iv.iv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Christ Was Truly Born; Marcion’s
Absurd Cavil in Defence of a Putative Nativity.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xi-p2"></span>All these illusions of an imaginary
corpo<span id="page_330">p. 330</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.xi-Page_330"></span>reity <span
id="fr_3234"></span>[3235](#fn_3234) in (his.md) Christ, Marcion adopted
with this view, that his nativity also might not be furnished with any
evidence from his human substance, and that thus the Christ of the
Creator might be free to have assigned to Him all predictions which
treated of Him as one capable of human birth, and therefore fleshly. But
most foolishly did our Pontic heresiarch act in this too. As if it would
not be more readily believed that flesh in the Divine Being should
rather be unborn than untrue, this belief having in fact had the way
mainly prepared for it by the Creator’s angels when they conversed in
flesh which was real, although unborn. For indeed the notorious
Philumena <span id="fr_3235"></span>[3236](#fn_3235.md) persuaded Apelles
and the other seceders from Marcion rather to believe that Christ did
really carry about a body of flesh; not derived to Him, however, from
birth, but one which He borrowed from the elements. Now, as Marcion was
apprehensive that a belief of the fleshly body would also involve a
belief of birth, undoubtedly He who seemed to be man was believed to be
verily and indeed born. For a certain woman had exclaimed, “Blessed is
the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked!” <span
id="fr_3236"></span>[3237](#fn_3236.md) And how else could they have said
that His mother and His brethren were standing without? <span
id="fr_3237"></span>[3238](#fn_3237.md) But we shall see more of this in
the proper place. <span id="fr_3238"></span>[3239](#fn_3238.md) Surely,
when He also proclaimed Himself as the Son of man, He, without doubt,
confessed that He had been born. Now I would rather refer all these
points to an examination of the gospel; but still, as I have already
stated, if he, who seemed to be man, had by all means to pass as having
been born, it was vain for him to suppose that faith in his nativity was
to be perfected <span id="fr_3239"></span>[3240](#fn_3239.md) by the device
of an imaginary flesh. For what advantage was there in that being not
true which was held to be true, whether it were his flesh or his birth?
Or if you should say, let human opinion go for nothing; <span
id="fr_3240"></span>[3241](#fn_3240.md) you are then honouring your god
under the shelter of a deception, since he knew himself to be something
different from what he had made men to think of him. In that case you
might possibly have assigned to him a putative nativity even, and so not
have hung the question on this point. For silly women fancy themselves
pregnant sometimes, when they are corpulent <span
id="fr_3241"></span>[3242](#fn_3241.md) either from their natural
flux <span id="fr_3242"></span>[3243](#fn_3242.md) or from some other
malady. And, no doubt, it had become his duty, since he had put on the
mere mask of his substance, to act out from its earliest scene the play
of his phantasy, lest he should have failed in his part at the beginning
of the flesh. You have, of course, <span
id="fr_3243"></span>[3244](#fn_3243.md) rejected the sham of a nativity,
and have produced true flesh itself. And, no doubt, even the real
nativity of a God is a most mean thing. <span
id="fr_3244"></span>[3245](#fn_3244.md) Come then, wind up your
cavils <span id="fr_3245"></span>[3246](#fn_3245.md) against the most
sacred and reverend works of nature; inveigh against all that you are;
destroy the origin of flesh and life; call the womb a sewer of the
illustrious animal—in other words, the manufactory for the production of
man; dilate on the impure and shameful tortures of parturition, and then
on the filthy, troublesome, contemptible issues of the puerperal labour
itself! But yet, after you have pulled all these things down to infamy,
that you may affirm them to be unworthy of God, birth will not be worse
for Him than death, infancy than the cross, punishment than nature,
condemnation than the flesh. If Christ truly suffered all this, to be
born was a less thing for Him. If Christ suffered evasively, <span
id="fr_3246"></span>[3247](#fn_3246.md) as a phantom; evasively, too, might
He have been born. Such are Marcion’s chief arguments by which he makes
out another Christ; and I think that we show plainly enough that they
are utterly irrelevant, when we teach how much more truly consistent
with God is the reality rather than the falsehood of that
condition <span id="fr_3247"></span>[3248](#fn_3247.md) in which He
manifested His Christ. Since He was “the truth,” He was flesh; since He
was flesh, He was born. For the points which this heresy assaults are
confirmed, when the means of the assault are destroyed. Therefore if He
is to be considered in the flesh, <span
id="fr_3248"></span>[3249](#fn_3248.md) because He was born; and born,
because He is in the flesh, and because He is no phantom,—it follows
that He must be acknowledged as Himself the very Christ of the Creator,
who was by the Creator’s prophets foretold as about to come in the
flesh, and by the process of human birth. <span
