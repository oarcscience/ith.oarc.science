<span id="v.iv.iv.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX. <span
id="fr_3370"></span>[3371](#fn_3370.md) —The Subsequent Influence of
Christ’s Death in the World Predicted. The Sure Mercies of David. What
These are.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xx-p3"></span>It is sufficient for my purpose to have
traced thus far the course of Christ’s dispensation in these
particulars. This has proved Him to be such a one as prophecy announced
He should be, so that He ought not to be regarded in any other character
than that which prediction assigned to Him; and the result of this
agreement between the facts of His course and the Scriptures of the
Creator should be the restoration of belief in them from that prejudice
which has, by contributing to diversity of opinion, either thrown doubt
upon, or led to a denial of, a considerable part of them. And now we go
further and build up the superstructure of those kindred events <span
id="fr_3371"></span>[3372](#fn_3371.md) out of the Scriptures of the
Creator which were predicted and destined to happen after Christ. For
the dispensation would not be found complete, if He had not come after
whom it had to run on its course. <span
id="fr_3372"></span>[3373](#fn_3372.md) Look at all nations from the vortex
of human error emerging out of it up to the Divine Creator, the Divine
Christ, and deny Him to be the object of prophecy, if you dare.  At once
there will occur to you the Father’s promise in the Psalms: “Thou art my
Son, this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of me, and I shall give Thee the
heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
Thy possession.” <span id="fr_3373"></span>[3374](#fn_3373.md) You will not
be able to put in a claim for some son of David being here meant, rather
than Christ; or for the ends of the earth being promised to David, whose
kingdom was confined to the Jewish nation simply, rather than to Christ,
who now embraces the whole world in the faith of His gospel. So again He
says by Isaiah: “I have given Thee for a dispensation of the people, for
a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind,” that is, those
that be in error, “to bring out the prisoners from the prison,” that is,
to free them from sin, “and from the prison-house,” that is, of death,
“those that sit in darkness”—even that of ignorance. <span
id="fr_3374"></span>[3375](#fn_3374.md) If these things are accomplished
through Christ, they would not have been designed in prophecy for any
other than Him through whom they have their accomplishment.  In another
passage He also says:  “Behold, I have set Him as a testimony to the
nations, a prince and commander to the nations; nations which know Thee
not shall invoke Thee, and peoples shall run together unto Thee.” <span
id="fr_3375"></span>[3376](#fn_3375.md) You will not interpret these words
of David, because He previously said, “I will make an everlasting
covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.” <span
id="fr_3376"></span>[3377](#fn_3376.md) Indeed, you will be obliged from
these words all the more to understand that Christ is reckoned to spring
from David by carnal descent, by reason of His birth <span
id="fr_3377"></span>[3378](#fn_3377.md) of the Virgin Mary. Touching this
promise of Him, there is the oath to David in the psalm, “Of the fruit
of thy body <span id="fr_3378"></span>[3379](#fn_3378.md) will I set upon
thy throne.” <span id="fr_3379"></span>[3380](#fn_3379.md) What body is
meant? David’s own?  Certainly not. For David was not to give birth to a
son. <span id="fr_3380"></span>[3381](#fn_3380.md) Nor his wife’s either.
For instead of saying, “Of the fruit of thy body,” he would then have
rather said, “Of the fruit of thy wife’s body.” But by mentioning
*his* <span id="fr_3381"></span>[3382](#fn_3381.md) body, it follows that
He pointed to some one of his race of whose body the flesh of Christ was
to be the fruit, which bloomed forth from <span
id="fr_3382"></span>[3383](#fn_3382.md) Mary’s womb. He named the fruit of
the body (womb) alone, because it was peculiarly fruit of the womb, of
the womb only in fact, and not of the husband also; and he refers the
womb (body) to David, as to the chief of the race and father of the
family. Because it could not consist with a virgin’s condition to
consort her with a husband, <span id="fr_3383"></span>[3384](#fn_3383.md)
He therefore attributed the body (womb) to the father. <span
id="page_339">p. 339</span> <span id="v.iv.iv.xx-Page_339"></span>That
new dispensation, then, which is found in Christ now, will prove to be
what the Creator then promised under the appellation of “the sure
mercies of David,” which were Christ’s, inasmuch as Christ sprang from
David, or rather His very flesh itself was David’s “sure mercies,”
consecrated by religion, and “sure” after its resurrection. Accordingly
the prophet Nathan, in the first of Kings, <span
id="fr_3384"></span>[3385](#fn_3384.md) makes a promise to David for his
seed, “which shall proceed,” says he, “out of thy bowels.” <span
id="fr_3385"></span>[3386](#fn_3385.md) Now, if you explain this simply of
Solomon, you will send me into a fit of laughter.  For David will
evidently have brought forth Solomon! But is not Christ here designated
the seed of David, as of that womb which was derived from David, that
is, Mary’s? Now, because Christ rather than any other <span
id="fr_3386"></span>[3387](#fn_3386.md) was to build the temple of God,
that is to say, a holy manhood, wherein God’s Spirit might dwell as in a
better temple, Christ rather than David’s son Solomon was to be looked
for as <span id="fr_3387"></span>[3388](#fn_3387.md) the Son of God. Then,
again, the throne for ever with the kingdom for ever is more suited to
Christ than to Solomon, a mere temporal king. From Christ, too, God’s
mercy did not depart, whereas on Solomon even God’s anger alighted,
after his luxury and idolatry. For Satan <span
id="fr_3388"></span>[3389](#fn_3388.md) stirred up an Edomite as an enemy
against him.  Since, therefore, nothing of these things is compatible
with Solomon, but only with Christ, the method of our interpretations
will certainly be true; and the very issue of the facts shows that they
were clearly predicted of Christ. And so in Him we shall have “the sure
mercies of David.” *Him*, not David, has God appointed for a testimony
to the nations; *Him*, for a prince and commander to the nations, not
David, who ruled over Israel alone. It is Christ whom all nations now
invoke, which knew Him not; Christ to whom all races now betake
themselves, whom they were ignorant of before. It is impossible that
that should be said to be future, which you see (daily) coming to pass.
