<span id="iv.iv.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Of Accepting Blessing in the
Name of Idols.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxii-p2"></span>Equally, one who has been initiated into
Christ will not endure to be blessed in the name of the gods of the
nations, so as not always to reject the unclean benediction, and to
cleanse it out for himself by converting it Godward.  To be blessed in
the name of the gods of the nations is to be cursed in the name of God.
If I have given an alms, or shown any other kindness, and the recipient
pray that his gods, or the Genius of the colony, may be propitious to
me, my oblation or act will immediately be an honour to idols, in whose
name he returns me the favour of blessing. But why should he not know
that I have done it for God’s sake; that God may rather be glorified,
and demons may not be honoured in that which I have done for the sake of
God? If God sees that I have done it for His sake, He equally sees that
I have been unwilling to *show* that I did it for His sake, and have in
a manner made His precept <span id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331) a
sacrifice to idols. Many say, “No one ought to divulge himself;” but I
think neither ought he to *deny* himself. For whoever dissembles in any
cause whatever, by being held as a heathen, <span id="page_75">p.
75</span> <span id="iv.iv.xxii-Page_75"></span>does deny; and, of
course, all denial is idolatry, just as all idolatry is denial, whether
in deeds or in words. <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332)
