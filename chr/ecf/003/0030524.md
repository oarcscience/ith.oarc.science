<span id="v.vi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Other Capricious Features in the
System. The Æons Unequal in Attributes. The Superiority of Nus; The
Vagaries of Sophia Restrained by Horos.  Grand Titles Borne by This Last
Power.</span>

<span id="v.vi.ix-p2"></span>But, further, there is an “acceptance <span
id="fr_6712"></span>[6713](#fn_6712.md) of persons,” inasmuch as Nus alone
among them all enjoys the knowledge of the immeasurable Father, joyous
and exulting, while they of course pine in sorrow. To be sure, Nus, so
far as in him lay, both wished and tried to impart to the others also
all that he had learnt about the greatness and incomprehensibility of
the Father; but his mother, Sige, interposed—she who (you must know)
imposes silence even on her own beloved heretics; <span
id="fr_6713"></span>[6714](#fn_6713.md) although they affirm that this is
done at the will of the Father, who will have all to be inflamed with a
longing after himself. Thus, while they are tormenting themselves with
these internal desires, while they are burning with the secret longing
to know the Father, the crime is almost accomplished. For of the twelve
Æons which Homo and Ecclesia had produced, the youngest by birth (never
mind the solecism, since Sophia (Wisdom) is her name), unable to
restrain herself, breaks away without the society of her husband
Theletus, in quest of the Father and contracts that kind of sin which
had indeed arisen amongst the others who were conversant with Nus but
had flowed on to this *Æon*, <span id="fr_6714"></span>[6715](#fn_6714.md)
that is, to Sophia; as is usual with maladies which, after arising in
one part of the body, spread abroad their infection to some other limb.
The fact is, <span id="fr_6715"></span>[6716](#fn_6715.md) under a pretence
of love to the Father, she was overcome with a desire to rival Nus, who
alone rejoiced in the knowledge of the Father. <span
id="fr_6716"></span>[6717](#fn_6716.md) But when Sophia, straining after
impossible aims, was disappointed of her hope, she is both overcome with
difficulty, and racked with affection. *Thus* she was all but swallowed
up by reason of the charm and toil (of her research), <span
id="fr_6717"></span>[6718](#fn_6717.md) and dissolved into the remnant of
*his* substance; <span id="fr_6718"></span>[6719](#fn_6718.md) nor would
there have been any other alternative for her than perdition, if she had
not by good luck fallen in with Horus (*Limit*). He too had considerable
power. He is the foundation of the great <span
id="fr_6719"></span>[6720](#fn_6719.md) universe, and, externally, the
guardian thereof. To him they give the additional names of Crux
(*Cross*), and Lytrotes (*Redeemer*,) and Carpistes
(*Emancipator*). <span id="fr_6720"></span>[6721](#fn_6720.md) When Sophia
was thus rescued from danger, and tardily persuaded, she relinquished
further research after the Father, found repose, and laid aside all her
excitement, <span id="fr_6721"></span>[6722](#fn_6721.md) *or* Enthymesis
(*Desire*,) along with the passion which had come over her.

<span id="v.vi.ix-p9"></span> It is not easy to say what is the meaning
of the words, “Et in reliquam substantiam dissolvi.” Rigaltius renders
them: “So that whatever substance was left to her was being dissolved.”
This seems to be forcing the sentence unnaturally. Irenæus (according to
the Latin translator) says:  “Resolutum in universam substantiam,”
“Resolved into his (the Father’s) general substance,” i. 2, 2.  \[Vol.
I. p. 317.\]
