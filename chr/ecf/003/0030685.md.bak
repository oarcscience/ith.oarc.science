<span id="v.x.iv-p2"></span>If, therefore, it is evident that from the
beginning this kind of worship has both been forbidden—witness the
commands so numerous and weighty—and that it has never been engaged in
without punishment following, as examples so numerous and impressive
show, and that no offence is counted by God so presumptuous as a
trespass of this sort, we ought further to perceive the purport of both
the divine threatenings and their fulfilments, which was even then
commended not only by the not calling in question, but also by the
enduring of martyrdoms, for which certainly He had given occasion by
forbidding idolatry.  For otherwise martyrdoms would not take place. And
certainly He had supplied, as a warrant for these, His own authority,
willing those events to come to pass for the occurrence of which He had
given occasion.  At present (it is important), for we are getting
severely stung concerning the will of God, <span id="page_637">p.
637</span> <span id="v.x.iv-Page_637"></span>and the scorpion repeats
the prick, denying the existence of this will, finding fault with it, so
that he either insinuates that there is another god, such that this is
not his will, or none the less overthrows ours, seeing such is his will,
or altogether denies *this* will of God, if he cannot deny Himself. But,
for our part, contending elsewhere about God, and about all the rest of
the body of heretical teaching, we now draw before us definite
lines <span id="fr_8249"></span>[8250](#fn_8249.md) for one form of
encounter, maintaining that this will, such as to have given occasion
for martyrdoms, is that of not another god than the God of Israel, on
the ground of the commandments relating to an always forbidden, as well
as of the judgments upon a punished, idolatry.  For if the keeping of a
command involves the suffering of violence, this will be, so to speak, a
command about keeping the command, requiring me to suffer that through
which I shall be able to keep the command, violence namely, whatever of
it threatens me when on my guard against idolatry. And certainly (in the
case supposed) the Author of the command extorts compliance with it. He
could not, therefore, have been unwilling that those events should come
to pass by means of which the compliance will be manifest. The
injunction is given me not to make mention of any other god, not even by
speaking,—as little by the tongue as by the hand,—to fashion a god, and
not to worship or in any way show reverence to another than Him only who
thus commands me, whom I am both bid fear that I may not be forsaken by
Him, and love with my whole being, that I may die for Him. Serving as a
soldier under this oath, I am challenged by the enemy.  If I surrender
to them, I am as they are. In maintaining this oath, I fight furiously
in battle, am wounded, hewn in pieces, slain.  Who wished this fatal
issue to his soldier, but he who sealed him by such an oath?
