<span id="v.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Hermogenes, After a Perverse
Induction from Mere Heretical Assumptions, Concludes that God Created
All Things Out of Pre-Existing Matter.</span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p2"></span>Our very bad painter has coloured this his
primary shade absolutely without any light, with such arguments as
these: He begins with laying down the premiss, <span
id="fr_6142"></span>[6143](#fn_6142.md) that the Lord made all things
either out of Himself, or out of nothing, or out of something; in order
that, after he has shown that it was impossible for Him to have made
them either out of Himself or out of nothing, he might thence affirm the
residuary proposition that He made them out of something, and therefore
that that something was Matter.  He could not have made all things, he
says, of Himself; because whatever <span id="page_478">p. 478</span>
<span id="v.v.ii-Page_478"></span>things the Lord made of Himself would
have been parts of Himself; but <span
id="fr_6143"></span>[6144](#fn_6143.md) He is not dissoluble into
parts, <span id="fr_6144"></span>[6145](#fn_6144.md) because, being the
Lord, He is indivisible, and unchangeable, and always the same. Besides,
if He had made anything out of Himself, it would have been something of
Himself. Everything, however, both which was made and which He made must
be accounted imperfect, because it was made of a part, and He made it of
a part; or if, again, it was a whole which He made, who is a whole
Himself, He must in that case have been at once both a whole, and yet
not a whole; because it behoved Him to be a whole, that He might produce
Himself, <span id="fr_6145"></span>[6146](#fn_6145.md) and yet not a whole,
that He might be produced out of Himself. <span
id="fr_6146"></span>[6147](#fn_6146.md) But this is a most difficult
position. For if He were in existence, He could not be made, for He was
in existence already; if, however, he were not in existence He could not
make, because He was a nonentity.  He *maintains*, moreover, that He who
always exists, does not *come into* existence, <span
id="fr_6147"></span>[6148](#fn_6147.md) but exists for ever and ever. He
accordingly concludes that He made nothing out of Himself, since He
never passed into such a condition <span
id="fr_6148"></span>[6149](#fn_6148.md) as made it possible for Him to make
anything out of Himself. In like manner, he contends that He could not
have made all things out of nothing—thus:  He defines the Lord as a
being who is good, nay, very good, who must will to make things as good
and excellent as He is Himself; indeed it were impossible for Him either
to will or to make anything which was not good, nay, very good itself.
Therefore all things ought to have been made good and excellent by Him,
after His own condition. Experience shows, <span
id="fr_6149"></span>[6150](#fn_6149.md) however, that things which are even
evil were made by Him: not, of course, of His own will and pleasure;
because, if it had been of His own will and pleasure, He would be sure
to have made nothing unfitting or unworthy of Himself.  That, therefore,
which He made not of His own will must be understood to have been made
from the fault of something, and that is from Matter, without a doubt.
