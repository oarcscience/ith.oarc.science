<span id="vi.vii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Certain Other Divine Precepts.
The Apostolic Description of Charity. Their Connection with
Patience.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.xii-p2"></span>As regards the rule of peace,
which <span id="fr_9131"></span>[9132](#fn_9131.md) is so pleasing to God,
who in the world that is prone to impatience <span
id="fr_9132"></span>[9133](#fn_9132.md) will even *once* forgive his
brother, I will not say “seven times,” or <span
id="fr_9133"></span>[9134](#fn_9133.md) “seventy-seven times?” <span
id="fr_9134"></span>[9135](#fn_9134.md) Who that is contemplating a suit
against his adversary will compose the matter by agreement, <span
id="fr_9135"></span>[9136](#fn_9135.md) unless he first begin by lopping
off chagrin, hardheartedness, and bitterness, which are in fact the
poisonous outgrowths of impatience? How will you “remit, and remission
shall be granted” you <span id="fr_9136"></span>[9137](#fn_9136.md) if the
absence of patience makes you tenacious of a wrong? No one who is at
variance with his brother in his mind, will finish offering his “duteous
gift at the altar,” unless he first, with intent to “reconciliate his
brother,” return to patience. <span id="fr_9137"></span>[9138](#fn_9137.md)
If “the sun go down over our wrath,” we are in jeopardy: <span
id="fr_9138"></span>[9139](#fn_9138.md) we are not allowed to remain one
day without patience. But, however, since Patience takes the lead
in <span id="fr_9139"></span>[9140](#fn_9139.md) every species of salutary
discipline, what <span id="page_715">p. 715</span> <span
id="vi.vii.xii-Page_715"></span>wonder that she likewise ministers to
Repentance, (accustomed as Repentance is to come to the rescue of such
as have fallen,) when, on a disjunction of wedlock (for that cause, I
mean, which makes it lawful, whether for husband or wife, to persist in
the perpetual observance of widowhood), <span
id="fr_9140"></span>[9141](#fn_9140.md) she <span
id="fr_9141"></span>[9142](#fn_9141.md) waits for, she yearns for, she
persuades by her entreaties, repentance in all who are one day to enter
salvation? How great a blessing she confers on each!  The one she
prevents from becoming an adulterer; the other she amends. So, too, she
is found in those holy examples touching patience in the Lord’s
parables. The shepherd’s patience seeks and finds the straying
ewe: <span id="fr_9142"></span>[9143](#fn_9142.md) for *Im*patience would
easily despise *one* ewe; but Patience undertakes the labour of the
quest, and the patient burden-bearer carries home on his shoulders the
forsaken sinner. <span id="fr_9143"></span>[9144](#fn_9143.md) That
prodigal son also the father’s patience receives, and clothes, and
feeds, and makes excuses for, in the presence of the angry brother’s
*im*patience. <span id="fr_9144"></span>[9145](#fn_9144.md) He, therefore,
who “had perished” is saved, because he entered on *the way of*
repentance. Repentance perishes not, because it finds Patience (to
welcome it).  For by whose teachings but those of Patience is
Charity <span id="fr_9145"></span>[9146](#fn_9145.md) —the highest
sacrament of the faith, the treasure-house of the Christian name, which
the apostle commends with the whole strength of the Holy Spirit—trained?
“Charity,” he says, “is long suffering;” thus she applies patience: “is
beneficent;” Patience does no evil: “is not emulous;” that certainly is
a peculiar mark of patience:  “savours not of violence:” <span
id="fr_9146"></span>[9147](#fn_9146.md) she has drawn her self-restraint
from patience: “is not puffed up; is not violent;” <span
id="fr_9147"></span>[9148](#fn_9147.md) for that pertains not unto
patience:  “nor does she seek her own” if, she *offers* her own,
provided she may benefit her neighbours: “nor is irritable;” if she
were, what would she have left to *Im*patience? Accordingly he says,
“Charity endures all things; tolerates all things;” of course because
she is patient. Justly, then, “will she never fail;” <span
id="fr_9148"></span>[9149](#fn_9148.md) for all other things will be
cancelled, will have their consummation. “Tongues, sciences, prophecies,
become exhausted; faith, hope, charity, are permanent:” Faith, which
Christ’s patience introduced; hope, which man’s patience waits for;
charity, which Patience accompanies, with God as Master.

<span id="vi.vii.xii-p12"></span> What the cause *is* is disputed.
Opinions are divided as to whether Tertullian means by it “marriage with
a heathen” (which as Mr. Dodgson reminds us, Tertullian—*de Uxor.* ii.
3—calls “adultery”), or the case in which our Lord allowed divorce.  See
