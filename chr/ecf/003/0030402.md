<span id="v.iv.v.iii"></span>

<span id="v.iv.v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III. <span
id="fr_3543"></span>[3544](#fn_3543.md) —Marcion Insinuated the
Untrustworthiness of Certain Apostles Whom St. Paul Rebuked. The Rebuke
Shows that It Cannot Be Regarded as Derogating from Their Authority. 
The Apostolic Gospels Perfectly Authentic.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.iii-p3"></span>In the scheme of Marcion, on the
contrary, <span id="fr_3544"></span>[3545](#fn_3544.md) the mystery <span
id="fr_3545"></span>[3546](#fn_3545.md) of the Christian religion begins
from the discipleship of Luke. Since, however, it was on its course
previous to that point, it must have had <span
id="fr_3546"></span>[3547](#fn_3546.md) its own authentic materials, <span
id="fr_3547"></span>[3548](#fn_3547.md) by means of which it found its own
way down to St. Luke; and by the assistance of the testimony which it
bore, Luke himself becomes admissible. Well, but <span
id="fr_3548"></span>[3549](#fn_3548.md) Marcion, finding the Epistle of
Paul to the Galatians (wherein he rebukes even apostles <span
id="fr_3549"></span>[3550](#fn_3549) .md) for “not walking uprightly
according to the truth of the gospel,” <span
id="fr_3550"></span>[3551](#fn_3550.md) as well as accuses certain false
apostles of perverting the gospel of Christ), labours very hard to
destroy the character <span id="fr_3551"></span>[3552](#fn_3551.md) of
those Gospels which are published as genuine <span
id="fr_3552"></span>[3553](#fn_3552.md) and under the name of apostles, in
order, forsooth, to secure for his own Gospel the credit which he takes
away from them. But then, even if he censures Peter and John and James,
who were thought to be pillars, it is for a manifest reason. They seemed
to be changing their company <span id="fr_3553"></span>[3554](#fn_3553.md)
from respect of persons. And yet as Paul himself “became all things to
all men,” <span id="fr_3554"></span>[3555](#fn_3554.md) that he might gain
all, it was possible that Peter also might have betaken himself to the
same plan of practising somewhat different from what he taught. And, in
like manner, if false apostles also crept in, their character too showed
itself in their insisting upon circumcision and the Jewish ceremonies. 
So that it was not on account of their preaching, but of their
conversation, that they were marked by St. Paul, who would with equal
impartiality have marked them with censure, if they had erred at all
with respect to God the Creator or His Christ.  Each several case will
therefore have to be distinguished. When Marcion complains that apostles
are suspected (for their prevarication and dissimulation) of having even
depraved the gospel, he thereby accuses Christ, by accusing those whom
Christ chose. If, then, the apostles, who are censured simply for
inconsistency of walk, composed the Gospel in a pure form, <span
id="fr_3555"></span>[3556](#fn_3555.md) but false apostles interpolated
their true record; and if our own copies have been made from
these, <span id="fr_3556"></span>[3557](#fn_3556.md) where will that
genuine text <span id="fr_3557"></span>[3558](#fn_3557.md) of the apostle’s
writings be found which has not suffered adulteration? Which was it that
enlightened Paul, and through him Luke? It is either completely blotted
out, as if by some deluge—being obliterated by the inundation of
falsifiers—in which case even Marcion does not possess the true Gospel;
or else, is that very *edition* which Marcion alone possesses *the* true
one, that is, of the apostles? How, then, does that agree with ours,
which is said not to be (the work) of apostles, but of Luke? Or else,
again, if that which Marcion uses is not to be attributed to Luke simply
because it does agree with ours (which, of course, <span
id="fr_3558"></span>[3559](#fn_3558) is, also adulterated in its title.md),
then it is the work of apostles. Our Gospel, therefore, which is in
agreement with it, is equally the work of apostles, but also adulterated
in its title. <span id="fr_3559"></span>[3560](#fn_3559.md)
