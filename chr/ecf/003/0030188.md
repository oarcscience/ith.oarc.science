<span id="iv.ix.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.ix.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Question Whether Christ Be
Come Taken Up.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.vii-p2"></span>Therefore upon this issue plant we foot
to foot, whether the Christ who was constantly announced as to come be
already come, or whether His coming be yet a subject of hope. For proof
of which question itself, the times likewise must be examined by us when
the prophets announced that the Christ would come; that, if we succeed
in recognising that He has come within the limits of those times, we may
without doubt believe Him to be the very one whose future coming was
ever the theme of prophetic song, upon whom *we*—the nations, to
wit—were ever announced as destined to believe; and that, when it shall
have been agreed that He is come, we may undoubtedly likewise believe
that the new law has by Him been given, and not disavow the new
testament in Him and through Him drawn up for us. For that Christ was to
come we know that even the Jews do not attempt to disprove, inasmuch as
it is to His advent that they are directing their hope.  Nor need we
inquire at more length concerning *that* matter, since in days bygone
all the prophets have prophesied of it; as Isaiah: “Thus saith the Lord
God to my Christ (the) Lord, <span id="fr_1217"></span>[1218](#fn_1217.md)
whose right hand I have holden, that the nations may hear Him: the
powers of kings will I burst asunder; I will open before Him the gates,
and the cities shall not be closed to Him.” Which very thing we see
fulfilled. For whose right hand does God the Father hold but Christ’s,
His Son?—whom all nations have heard, that is, whom all nations have
believed,—whose preachers, withal, the apostles, are pointed to in the
Psalms of David: “Into the universal earth,” says he, “is gone out their
sound, and unto the ends of the earth their words.” <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[1219](#fn_1218.md) For upon whom else have the
universal nations believed, but upon the Christ who is already come? For
whom have the nations believed,—Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and they who
inhabit Mesopotamia, Armenia, Phrygia, Cappadocia, and they who <span
id="page_158">p. 158</span> <span id="iv.ix.vii-Page_158"></span>dwell
in Pontus, and Asia, and Pamphylia, tarriers in Egypt, and inhabiters of
the region of Africa which is beyond Cyrene, Romans and sojourners, yes,
and in Jerusalem Jews, <span id="fr_1219"></span>[1220](#fn_1219.md) and
all other nations; as, for instance, by this time, the varied races of
the Gætulians, and manifold confines of the Moors, all the limits of the
Spains, and the diverse nations of the Gauls, and the haunts of the
Britons—inaccessible to the Romans, but subjugated to Christ, and of the
Sarmatians, and Dacians, and Germans, and Scythians, and of many remote
nations, and of provinces and islands many, to us unknown, and which we
can scarce enumerate? In all which places the name of the Christ who is
already come reigns, as of Him before whom the gates of all cities have
been opened, and to whom none are closed, before whom iron bars have
been crumbled, and brazen gates <span
id="fr_1220"></span>[1221](#fn_1220.md) opened. Although there be withal a
spiritual sense to be affixed to these expressions,—that the hearts of
individuals, blockaded in various ways by the devil, are unbarred by the
faith of Christ,—still they have been evidently fulfilled, inasmuch as
in all these places dwells the “people” of the Name of Christ. For who
*could* have reigned *over all nations* but Christ, God’s Son, who was
ever announced as destined to reign over all to eternity? For if Solomon
“reigned,” why, it was within the confines of Judea merely:  “from
Beersheba unto Dan” the boundaries of his kingdom are marked. <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[1222](#fn_1221.md) If, moreover, Darius “reigned” over
the Babylonians and Parthians, he had not power *over all nations*; if
Pharaoh, or whoever succeeded him in his hereditary kingdom, over the
Egyptians, in that country merely did he possess his kingdom’s dominion;
if Nebuchadnezzar with his petty kings, “from India unto Ethiopia” he
had his kingdom’s boundaries; <span id="fr_1222"></span>[1223](#fn_1222.md)
if Alexander the Macedonian he did not hold more than universal Asia,
and other regions, after he had quite conquered them; if the Germans, to
this day they are not suffered to cross their own limits; the Britons
are shut within the circuit of their own ocean; the nations of the
Moors, and the barbarism of the Gætulians, are blockaded by the Romans,
lest they exceed the confines of their own regions. What shall I say of
the Romans themselves, <span id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223.md) who
fortify their own empire with garrisons of their own legions, nor can
extend the might of their kingdom beyond these nations? But Christ’s
Name is extending everywhere, believed everywhere, worshipped by all the
above-enumerated nations, reigning everywhere, adored everywhere,
conferred equally everywhere upon all. No king, with Him, finds greater
favour, no barbarian lesser joy; no dignities or pedigrees enjoy
distinctions of merit; to all He is equal, to all King, to all Judge, to
all “God and Lord.” <span id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224.md) Nor would
you hesitate to believe what we asseverate, since you see it taking
place.

difference. For <span class="Greek"><span

the verse is omitted in Tischendorf’s text, ed. Lips. 1860, though given
in his footnotes there.) The statement in the text differs slightly from
Oehler’s reading; where I suspect there is a transposition of a
syllable, and that for “in finibus *Judæ* tantum, a *Bersabeæ*,” we
ought to read “in finibus *Judææ* tantum, a *Bersabe*.” See *de Jej*. c.
