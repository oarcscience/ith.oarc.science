<span id="v.vi.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Achamoth Purified from All
Impurities of Her Passion by the Paraclete, Acting Through Soter, Who
Out of the Above-Mentioned Impurities Arranges Matter, Separating Its
Evil from the Better Qualities.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xvi-p2"></span>She, too, resorts to prayers, after the
manner of her mother.  But Christ, Who now felt a dislike to quit the
Pleroma, appoints the Paraclete as his deputy. To her, therefore, he
despatches Soter, <span id="fr_6789"></span>[6790](#fn_6789.md) (who must
be the same as Jesus, to whom the Father imparted the supreme power over
the whole body of the Æons, by subjecting them all to him, so that “by
him,” as the apostle says, “all things were created” <span
id="fr_6790"></span>[6791](#fn_6790) .md), with a retinue and cortege of
contemporary angels, and (as one may suppose) with the dozen fasces.
Hereupon Achamoth, being quite struck with the pomp of his approach,
immediately covered herself with a veil, moved at first with a dutiful
feeling of veneration and modesty; but afterwards she surveys him
calmly, and his prolific equipage. <span
id="fr_6791"></span>[6792](#fn_6791.md) With such energies as she had
derived from the contemplation, she meets him with the salutation, <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.vi.xvi-p5.1"></span>Κύριε, χαῖρε</span>
(“Hail, Lord”)! Upon this, I suppose, he receives her, confirms and
conforms her in knowledge, as well as cleanses <span
id="fr_6792"></span>[6793](#fn_6792.md) her from all the outrages of
Passion, without, however, utterly severing them, with an
indiscriminateness like that which had happened in the casualties which
befell her mother. For such vices as had become inveterate and confirmed
by practice he throws together; and when he had consolidated them in one
mass, he fixes them in a separate body, so as to compose the corporeal
condition of Matter, extracting out of her inherent, incorporeal passion
such an aptitude of nature <span id="fr_6793"></span>[6794](#fn_6793.md) as
might qualify it to attain to a reciprocity of bodily substances, <span
id="fr_6794"></span>[6795](#fn_6794.md) which should emulate one another,
so that a twofold condition of the substances might be arranged; *one*
full of evil through its faults, *the other* susceptible of passion from
conversion.  This will prove to be Matter, which has set us in battle
array against Hermogenes, and all others who presume to teach that God
made all things out of Matter, not out of nothing.
