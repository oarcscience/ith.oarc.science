<span id="v.vi.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—The Three Several Natures—The
Material, the Animal, and the Spiritual, and Their Several
Destinations.  The Strange Valentinian Opinion About the Structure of
Soter’s Nature.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxvi-p2"></span>In like manner they assign to each of
them a separate end. <span id="fr_6851"></span>[6852](#fn_6851) To the
material, that is to say the carnal (nature), which they also call “the
left-handed,” they assign undoubted <span id="page_516">p. 516</span>
<span id="v.vi.xxvi-Page_516"></span>destruction; to the animal
(nature), which they also call “the right-handed,” a doubtful issue,
inasmuch as it oscillates between the material and the spiritual, and is
sure to fall at last on the side to which it has mainly gravitated. As
regards the spiritual, however, (they say) that it enters into the
formation of the animal, in order that it may be educated in company
with it and be disciplined by repeated intercourse with it. For the
animal (nature) was in want of training even by the senses: for this
purpose, accordingly, was the whole structure of the world provided; for
this purpose also did Soter (*the Saviour*) present Himself in the
world—even for the salvation of the animal (nature). By yet another
arrangement they will have it that He, in some prodigious way, <span
id="fr_6852"></span>[6853](#fn_6852) clothed Himself with the primary
portions <span id="fr_6853"></span>[6854](#fn_6853) of those substances,
the whole of which He was going to restore to salvation; in such wise
that He assumed the spiritual nature from Achamoth, whilst He derived
the animal (being), Christ, afterwards from the Demiurge; His corporal
substance, however, which was constructed of an animal nature (only with
wonderful and indescribable skill), He wore for a dispensational
purpose, in order that He might, in spite of His own
unwillingness, <span id="fr_6854"></span>[6855](#fn_6854) be capable of
meeting persons, and of being seen and touched by them, and even of
dying. But there was nothing material assumed by Him, inasmuch as *that*
was incapable of salvation. As if He could possibly have been more
required by any others than by those who were in want of salvation! And
all this, in order that by severing the condition of our flesh from
Christ they may also deprive it of the hope of salvation!

Being Incapable of Suffering, He Left Christ to Die on the Cross
