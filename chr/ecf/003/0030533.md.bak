<span id="v.vi.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Blasphemous Opinion
Concerning the Origin of the Demiurge, Supposed to Be the Creator of the
Universe.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xviii-p2"></span>Having become a better proficient <span
id="fr_6798"></span>[6799](#fn_6798.md) in practical conduct by the
authority which, we may well suppose, <span
id="fr_6799"></span>[6800](#fn_6799.md) accrued to her from her three
children, she determined to impart form to each of the natures. The
spiritual one however, she was unable to touch, inasmuch as she was
herself spiritual. For a participation in the same nature has, to a very
great extent, <span id="fr_6800"></span>[6801](#fn_6800.md) disqualified
like and consubstantial beings from having superior power over one
another. Therefore <span id="fr_6801"></span>[6802](#fn_6801.md) she
applies herself solely to the animal nature, adducing the instructions
of Soter <span id="fr_6802"></span>[6803](#fn_6802) (for her guidance.md).
And first of all (she does) what cannot be described and read, and heard
of, without an intense horror at the blasphemy thereof: she produces
this God of ours, the God of all except of the heretics, the Father and
Creator <span id="fr_6803"></span>[6804](#fn_6803.md) and King of all
things, which are inferior to him. For from him do they proceed. If,
however, they proceed from him, and not rather from Achamoth, or if only
secretly from her, without his perceiving her, he was impelled to all
that he did, even like a puppet <span
id="fr_6804"></span>[6805](#fn_6804.md) which is moved from the outside. In
fact, it was owing to this very ambiguity about the personal agency in
the works which were done, that they coined for him the mixed name of
(*Motherly Father*), <span id="fr_6805"></span>[6806](#fn_6805.md) whilst
his other appellations were distinctly assigned according to the
conditions and positions of his works:  so that they call him *Father*
in relation to the animal substances to which they give the place of
honour <span id="fr_6806"></span>[6807](#fn_6806.md) on his right hand;
whereas, in respect of the material substances which they banish <span
id="fr_6807"></span>[6808](#fn_6807.md) to his left hand, they name him
*Demiurgus*; whilst *his title King* designates his authority over both
classes, *nay* over the universe. <span
id="fr_6808"></span>[6809](#fn_6808.md)
