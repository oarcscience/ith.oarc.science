<p class="c30"><a name="v.vi.xxvii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="v.vi.xxvii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXVII.&#8212;The Christ of the Demiurge, Sent into the World by the Virgin. Not of Her. He Found in Her, Not a Mother, But Only a Passage or Channel. Jesus Descended Upon Christ, at His Baptism, Like a Dove; But, Being Incapable of Suffering, He Left Christ to Die on the Cross Alone.</span></p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="v.vi.xxvii-p2"></A>I now adduce&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6855"></A><A HREF="#fn_6855"><FONT SIZE="1">6856</FONT></A>
 (what they say) concerning Christ, upon whom some of them engraft Jesus with so much licence, that they foist into Him a spiritual seed together with an animal <i>inflatus</i>. Indeed, I will not undertake to describe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6856"></A><A HREF="#fn_6856"><FONT SIZE="1">6857</FONT></A>
 these incongruous crammings,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6857"></A><A HREF="#fn_6857"><FONT SIZE="1">6858</FONT></A>
 which they have contrived in relation both to their men and their gods. Even the Demiurge has a Christ of His own&#8212;His natural Son. An animal, in short, produced by Himself, proclaimed by the prophets&#8212;His position being one which must be decided by prepositions; in other words, He was produced <i>by means of</i> a virgin, rather than <i>of</i> a virgin! On the ground that, having descended into the virgin rather in the manner of a passage through her than of a birth by her, He came into existence <i>through</i> her, not <i>of</i> her&#8212;not experiencing a mother in her, but nothing more than a way. Upon this same Christ, therefore (so they say), Jesus descended in the sacrament of baptism, in the likeness of a dove.&#160; Moreover, there was even in Christ accruing from Achamoth the condiment of a spiritual seed, in order of course to prevent the corruption of all the other stuffing.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6858"></A><A HREF="#fn_6858"><FONT SIZE="1">6859</FONT></A>
 For after the precedent of the principal Tetrad, they guard him with four substances&#8212;the spiritual one of Achamoth, the animal one of the Demiurge, the corporeal one, which cannot be described, and that of Soter, or, in other phrase, the columbine.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6859"></A><A HREF="#fn_6859"><FONT SIZE="1">6860</FONT></A>
 As for Soter (<i>Jesus</i>), he remained in Christ to the last, impassible, incapable of injury, incapable of apprehension. By and by, when it came to a question of capture, he departed from him during the examination before Pilate. In like manner, his mother&#146;s seed did not admit of being injured, being equally exempt from all manner of outrage,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6860"></A><A HREF="#fn_6860"><FONT SIZE="1">6861</FONT></A>
 and being undiscovered even by the Demiurge himself. The animal and carnal Christ, however, does suffer after the fashion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6861"></A><A HREF="#fn_6861"><FONT SIZE="1">6862</FONT></A>
 of the superior Christ, who, for the purpose of producing Achamoth, had been stretched upon the cross, that is, Horos, in a substantial though not a cognizable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6862"></A><A HREF="#fn_6862"><FONT SIZE="1">6863</FONT></A>
 form. In this manner do they reduce all things to mere images&#8212;Christians themselves being indeed nothing but imaginary beings!</p>
