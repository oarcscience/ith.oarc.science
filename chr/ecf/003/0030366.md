<span id="v.iv.iii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—The Brazen Serpent and the
Golden Cherubim Were Not Violations of the Second Commandment. Their
Meaning.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xxii-p2"></span>Likewise, when forbidding the
similitude to be made of all things which are in heaven, and in earth,
and in the waters, He declared also the reasons, as being prohibitory of
all material exhibition <span id="fr_2962"></span>[2963](#fn_2962) of a
latent <span id="fr_2963"></span>[2964](#fn_2963) idolatry. For He adds:
“Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor serve them.” The form, however, of
the brazen serpent which the Lord afterwards commanded Moses to make,
afforded no pretext <span id="fr_2964"></span>[2965](#fn_2964) for
idolatry, but was meant for the cure of those who were plagued with the
fiery serpents. <span id="fr_2965"></span>[2966](#fn_2965) I say nothing
of what was figured by this cure. <span
id="fr_2966"></span>[2967](#fn_2966) Thus, too, the golden Cherubim and
Seraphim were purely an ornament in the figured fashion <span
id="fr_2967"></span>[2968](#fn_2967) of the ark; adapted to
ornamentation for reasons totally remote from all condition of idolatry,
on account of which the making a likeness is prohibited; and they are
evidently not at variance with <span
id="fr_2968"></span>[2969](#fn_2968) this law of prohibition, because
they are not found in that form <span
id="fr_2969"></span>[2970](#fn_2969) of similitude, in reference to
which the prohibition is given. We have spoken <span
id="fr_2970"></span>[2971](#fn_2970) of the rational institution of the
sacrifices, as calling off their homage from idols to God; and if He
afterwards rejected this homage, saying, “To what purpose is the
multitude of your sacrifices unto me?” <span
id="fr_2971"></span>[2972](#fn_2971) —He meant nothing else than this to
be understood, that He had never really required such homage for
Himself. For He says, “I will not eat the flesh of bulls;” <span
id="fr_2972"></span>[2973](#fn_2972) and in another passage: “The
everlasting God shall neither hunger nor thirst.” <span
id="fr_2973"></span>[2974](#fn_2973) Although He had respect to the
offerings of Abel, and smelled a sweet savour from the holocaust of
Noah, yet what pleasure could He receive from the flesh of sheep, or the
odour of burning victims? And yet the simple and God-fearing mind of
those who offered what they were receiving from God, both in the way of
food and of a sweet smell, was favourably accepted before God, in the
sense of respectful homage <span id="fr_2974"></span>[2975](#fn_2974) to
God, who did not so much want what was offered, as that which prompted
the offering. Suppose now, that some dependant were to offer to a rich
man or a king, who was in want of nothing, some very insignificant gift,
will the amount and quality of the gift bring dishonour <span
id="fr_2975"></span>[2976](#fn_2975) to the rich man and the king; or
will the consideration <span id="fr_2976"></span>[2977](#fn_2976) of the
homage give them pleasure? Were, however, the dependant, either of his
own accord or even in compliance with a command, to present to him gifts
suitably to his rank, and were he to observe the solemnities due to a
king, only without faith and purity of heart, and without any readiness
for other acts of obedience, will not that king or rich man consequently
exclaim: “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? I
am full of your solemnities, your feast-days, and your Sabbaths.” <span
id="fr_2977"></span>[2978](#fn_2977) By calling them *yours*, as having
been performed <span id="fr_2978"></span>[2979](#fn_2978) after the
giver’s own will, and not according to the religion of God (since he
displayed them as his own, and not as God’s), *the Almighty in this
passage*, demonstrated how suitable to the conditions of the case, and
how reasonable, was His rejection of those very offerings which He had
commanded to be made to Him.
