<span id="vi.ii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—True Repentance a Thing Divine,
Originated by God, and Subject to His Laws.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p2"></span>But if they acted as men who had any part
in God, and thereby in reason also, they would first weigh well the
importance of repentance, and would never apply it in such a way as to
make it a ground for *convicting themselves of* perverse self-amendment.
In short, they would regulate the limit of their repentance, because
they would reach (a limit) in sinning too—by fearing God, I mean.  But
where there is no fear, in like manner there is no amendment; where
there is no amendment, repentance is of necessity vain, for it lacks the
fruit for which God sowed it; that is, man’s salvation. For God—after so
many and so great sins of human temerity, begun by the first of the
race, Adam, after the condemnation of man, together with the dowry of
the world <span id="fr_8423"></span>[8424](#fn_8423.md) after his ejection
from paradise and subjection to death—when He had hasted back to His own
mercy, did from that time onward inaugurate repentance in His own self,
by rescinding the sentence of His first wrath, engaging to grant pardon
to His own work and image. <span id="fr_8424"></span>[8425](#fn_8424.md)
And so He gathered together a people for Himself, and fostered them with
many liberal distributions of His bounty, and, after so often finding
them most ungrateful, ever exhorted them to repentance and sent out the
voices of the universal company of the prophets to prophesy. By and by,
promising freely the grace which in the last times He was intending to
pour as a flood of light on the universal world <span
id="fr_8425"></span>[8426](#fn_8425.md) through His <span id="page_658">p.
658</span> <span id="vi.ii.ii-Page_658"></span>Spirit, He bade the
baptism of repentance lead the way, with the view of first
preparing, <span id="fr_8426"></span>[8427](#fn_8426.md) by means of the
sign and seal of repentance, them whom He was calling, through grace, to
(inherit) the promise surely made to Abraham. John holds not his peace,
saying, “Enter upon repentance, for now shall salvation approach the
nations” <span id="fr_8427"></span>[8428](#fn_8427.md) —the Lord, that is,
bringing salvation according to God’s promise. To Him John, as His
harbinger, directed the repentance (which he preached), whose province
was the purging of men’s minds, that whatever defilement inveterate
error had imparted, whatever contamination in the heart of man ignorance
had engendered, *that* repentance should sweep and scrape away, and cast
out of doors, and thus prepare the home of the heart, by making it
clean, for the Holy Spirit, who was about to supervene, that He might
with pleasure introduce Himself there-into, together with His celestial
blessings. Of these blessings the title is *briefly* one—the salvation
of man—the abolition of former sins being the preliminary step.
This <span id="fr_8428"></span>[8429](#fn_8428) is the (final.md) cause of
repentance, this her work, in taking in hand the business of divine
mercy. What is profitable to man does service to God.  The *rule* of
repentance, however, which we learn when we know the Lord, retains a
definite form,—*viz*., that no violent hands so to speak, be ever laid
on *good* deeds or thoughts. <span id="fr_8429"></span>[8430](#fn_8429.md)
For God, never giving His sanction to the reprobation of good *deeds*,
inasmuch as they are His own (of which, being the author, He must
necessarily be the defender too), is in like manner the acceptor of
them, and if the acceptor, likewise the rewarder. Let, then, the
ingratitude of men see to it, <span id="fr_8430"></span>[8431](#fn_8430.md)
if it attaches repentance even to good works; let their gratitude see to
it too, if the desire of earning it be the incentive to well-doing:
earthly and mortal are they each. For how small is your gain if you do
good to a grateful man! or your loss if to an ungrateful! A *good* deed
has <span class="sc"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p10.1"></span>God</span> as its
debtor, just as an *evil* has too; for a judge is rewarder of every
cause. Well, since, God as Judge presides over the exacting and
maintaining <span id="fr_8431"></span>[8432](#fn_8431.md) of justice, which
to Him is most dear; and since it is with an eye to justice that He
appoints all the sum of His discipline, is there room for doubting that,
just as in all our acts universally, so also in the case of repentance,
justice must be rendered to God?—which duty can indeed only be fulfilled
on the condition that repentance be brought to bear *only* on *sins*.
Further, no deed but an *evil* one deserves to be called *sin*, nor does
any one err by well-doing. But if he does not err, why does he invade
(the province of) repentance, the private ground of such as do err? Why
does he impose on his goodness a duty proper to wickedness? Thus it
comes to pass that, when a thing is called into play where it ought not,
there, where it ought, it is neglected.
