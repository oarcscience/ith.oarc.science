<span id="v.iii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—St. Peter’s Further
Vindication. St. Paul Not Superior to St. Peter in Teaching. Nothing
Imparted to the Former in the Third Heaven Enabled Him to Add to the
Faith. Heretics Boast as If Favoured with Some of the Secrets Imparted
to Him.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxiv-p2"></span>I have not the good fortune, <span
id="fr_2101"></span>[2102](#fn_2101.md) or, as I must rather say, <span
id="fr_2102"></span>[2103](#fn_2102.md) I have not the unenviable
task, <span id="fr_2103"></span>[2104](#fn_2103.md) of setting apostles by
the ears. <span id="fr_2104"></span>[2105](#fn_2104.md) But, inasmuch as
our very perverse cavillers obtrude the rebuke in question for the set
purpose of bringing the earlier <span
id="fr_2105"></span>[2106](#fn_2105.md) doctrine into suspicion, I will put
in a defence, as it were, for Peter, to the effect that even Paul said
that he was “made all things to all men—to the Jews a Jew,” to those who
were not Jews as one who was not a Jew—“that he might gain all.” <span
id="fr_2106"></span>[2107](#fn_2106.md) Therefore it was according to times
and persons and causes that they used to censure certain practices,
which they would not hesitate themselves to pursue, in like conformity
to times and persons and causes. Just (*e.g.*) as if Peter too had
censured Paul, because, whilst forbidding circumcision, he actually
circumcised Timothy himself. Never mind <span
id="fr_2107"></span>[2108](#fn_2107.md) those who pass sentence on
apostles! It is a happy fact that Peter is on the same level with Paul
in the very glory <span id="fr_2108"></span>[2109](#fn_2108.md) of
martyrdom. Now, although Paul was carried away even to the third heaven,
and was caught up to paradise, <span
id="fr_2109"></span>[2110](#fn_2109.md) and heard certain revelations
there, yet these cannot possibly seem to have qualified him for
(teaching) another doctrine, seeing that their very nature was such as
to render them communicable to no human being. <span
id="fr_2110"></span>[2111](#fn_2110.md) If, however, that unspeakable
mystery <span id="fr_2111"></span>[2112](#fn_2111.md) did leak out, <span
id="fr_2112"></span>[2113](#fn_2112.md) and become known to any man, and if
any heresy affirms that it does itself follow the same, (then) either
Paul must be charged with having betrayed the secret, or some other man
must actually <span id="fr_2113"></span>[2114](#fn_2113.md) be shown to
have been afterwards “caught up into paradise,” who had permission to
speak out plainly what Paul was not allowed (even) to mutter.
