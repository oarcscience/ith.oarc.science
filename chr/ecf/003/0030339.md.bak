<span id="v.iv.ii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—God is Not a Being of Simple
Goodness; Other Attributes Belong to Him. Marcion Shows Inconsistency in
the Portraiture of His Simply Good and Emotionless God.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xxv-p2"></span>As touching this question of goodness,
we have in these outlines of our argument shown it to be in no way
compatible with Deity,—as being neither natural, <span
id="fr_2635"></span>[2636](#fn_2635.md) nor rational, nor perfect, but
wrong, <span id="fr_2636"></span>[2637](#fn_2636.md) and unjust, and
unworthy of the very name of goodness,—because, as far as the congruity
of the divine character is concerned, it cannot indeed be fitting that
that Being should be regarded as God who is alleged to have *such* a
goodness, and that not in a modified way, but simply and solely. For it
is, furthermore, at this point quite open to discussion, whether God
ought to be regarded as a Being of simple goodness, to the exclusion of
all those other attributes, <span id="fr_2637"></span>[2638](#fn_2637.md)
sensations, and affections, which the Marcionites indeed transfer from
their god to the Creator, and which we acknowledge to be worthy
characteristics of the Creator too, but only because we consider Him to
be God. Well, then, on this ground we shall deny him to be God in whom
all things are not to be found which befit the Divine Being. If
(Marcion) chose <span id="fr_2638"></span>[2639](#fn_2638.md) to take any
one of the school of Epicurus, and entitle him God in the name of
Christ, on the ground <span id="page_291">p. 291</span> <span
id="v.iv.ii.xxv-Page_291"></span>that what is happy and incorruptible
can bring no trouble either on itself or anything else (for Marcion,
while poring over <span id="fr_2639"></span>[2640](#fn_2639.md) this
opinion of the divine indifference, has removed from him all the
severity and energy of the judicial <span
id="fr_2640"></span>[2641](#fn_2640) character.md), it was his duty to have
developed his conceptions into some imperturbable and listless god (and
then what could *he* have had in common with Christ, who occasioned
trouble both to the Jews by what He taught, and to Himself by what He
felt?), or else to have admitted that he was possessed of the same
emotions as others <span id="fr_2641"></span>[2642](#fn_2641.md) (and in
such case what would he have had to do with Epicurus, who was no
friend <span id="fr_2642"></span>[2643](#fn_2642.md) to either him or
Christians?). For that a being who in ages past <span
id="fr_2643"></span>[2644](#fn_2643.md) was in a quiescent state, not
caring to communicate any knowledge of himself by any work all the
while, should come after so long a time to entertain a concern for man’s
salvation, of course by his own will,—did he not by this very fact
become susceptible of the impulse <span
id="fr_2644"></span>[2645](#fn_2644.md) of a new volition, so as palpably
to be open to all other emotions? But what volition is unaccompanied
with the spur of desire? <span id="fr_2645"></span>[2646](#fn_2645.md) Who
wishes for what he desires not? Moreover, care will be another companion
of the will. For who will wish for any object and desire to have it,
without also *caring* to obtain it? When, therefore, (Marcion’s god)
felt both a will and a desire for man’s salvation, he certainly
occasioned some concern and trouble both to himself and others. This
Marcion’s theory suggests, though Epicurus demurs. For he <span
id="fr_2646"></span>[2647](#fn_2646.md) raised up an adversary against
himself in that very thing against which his will and desire, and care
were directed,—whether it were sin or death,—and more especially in
their Tyrant and Lord, the Creator of man. Again, <span
id="fr_2647"></span>[2648](#fn_2647.md) nothing will ever run its course
without hostile rivalry, <span id="fr_2648"></span>[2649](#fn_2648.md)
which shall not (itself) be without a hostile aspect. In fact, <span
id="fr_2649"></span>[2650](#fn_2649.md) when willing, desiring, and caring
to deliver man, (Marcion’s god) already in the very act encounters a
rival, both in Him from whom He effects the deliverance (for of
course <span id="fr_2650"></span>[2651](#fn_2650.md) he means the
liberation to be an opposition to Him), and also in those things from
which the deliverance is wrought (the intended liberation being to the
advantage of some other things). For it must needs be, that upon rivalry
its own ancillary passions <span id="fr_2651"></span>[2652](#fn_2651.md)
will be in attendance, against whatever objects its emulation is
directed: anger, discord, hatred, disdain, indignation, spleen,
loathing, displeasure. Now, since all these emotions are present to
rivalry; since, moreover, the rivalry which arises in liberating man
excites them; and since, again, this deliverance of man is an operation
of goodness, it follows that this goodness avails nothing without its
endowments, <span id="fr_2652"></span>[2653](#fn_2652.md) that is to say,
without those sensations and affections whereby it carries out its
purpose <span id="fr_2653"></span>[2654](#fn_2653.md) against the Creator;
so that it cannot even in this be ruled <span
id="fr_2654"></span>[2655](#fn_2654.md) to be irrational, as if it were
wanting in proper sensations and affections. These points we shall have
to insist on <span id="fr_2655"></span>[2656](#fn_2655.md) much more fully,
when we come to plead the cause of the Creator, where they will also
incur our condemnation.
