<span id="vi.iii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Of the Power of Conferring
Baptism.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xvii-p2"></span>For concluding our brief subject, <span
id="fr_8705"></span>[8706](#fn_8705.md) it remains to put you in mind also
of the due observance of giving and receiving baptism. Of giving it, the
chief priest <span id="fr_8706"></span>[8707](#fn_8706.md) (who is the
bishop) has the right: in the next place, the presbyters and deacons,
yet not without the bishop’s authority, on account of the honour of the
Church, which being preserved, peace is preserved. Beside these, even
laymen have the right; for what is equally received can be equally
given. Unless bishops, or priests, or deacons, be on the spot, *other*
disciples are called *i.e. to the work*. The word of the Lord ought not
to be hidden by any: in like manner, too, baptism, which is equally
God’s property, <span id="fr_8707"></span>[8708](#fn_8707.md) can be
administered by all. But how much more is the rule <span
id="fr_8708"></span>[8709](#fn_8708.md) of reverence and modesty incumbent
on laymen—seeing that these *powers* <span
id="fr_8709"></span>[8710](#fn_8709.md) belong to their superiors—lest they
assume to themselves the *specific* <span
id="fr_8710"></span>[8711](#fn_8710.md) function of the bishop! Emulation
of the episcopal office is the mother of schisms.  The most holy apostle
has said, that “all things are *lawful*, but not all *expedient*.” <span
id="fr_8711"></span>[8712](#fn_8711.md) Let it suffice assuredly, in cases
of *necessity*, to avail yourself (of that rule <span
id="fr_8712"></span>[8713](#fn_8712.md) , if at any time circumstance
either of place, or of time, or of person compels you (so to do); for
*then* the stedfast courage of the succourer, when the situation of the
endangered one is urgent, is exceptionally admissible; inasmuch as he
will be guilty of a human creature’s loss if he shall refrain from
bestowing what he had free liberty to bestow. But the woman of
pertness, <span id="fr_8713"></span>[8714](#fn_8713.md) who has usurped the
power to teach, will of course not give birth for herself likewise to a
right of baptizing, unless some new beast shall arise <span
id="fr_8714"></span>[8715](#fn_8714.md) like the former; so that, just as
the one abolished baptism, <span id="fr_8715"></span>[8716](#fn_8715.md) so
some other should in her own right confer it! But if the writings which
wrongly go under Paul’s name, claim Thecla’s example as a licence for
women’s teaching and baptizing, let them know that, in Asia, the
presbyter who composed that writing, <span
id="fr_8716"></span>[8717](#fn_8716.md) as if he were augmenting Paul’s
fame from his own store, after being convicted, and confessing that he
had done it from love of Paul, was removed <span
id="fr_8717"></span>[8718](#fn_8717.md) from his office. For how credible
would it seem, that he who has not permitted a *woman* <span
id="fr_8718"></span>[8719](#fn_8718.md) even to *learn* with over-boldness,
should give a *female* <span id="fr_8719"></span>[8720](#fn_8719.md) the
power of *teaching* and of *baptizing*! “Let them be silent,” he says,
“and at home consult their own husbands.” <span
id="fr_8720"></span>[8721](#fn_8720.md)
