<p class="c19"><a name="v.viii.xii-p2"></A>Consider now those very analogies of the divine power (to which we have just alluded). Day dies into night, and is buried everywhere in darkness. The glory of the world is obscured in the shadow of death; its entire substance is tarnished with blackness; all things become sordid, silent, stupid; everywhere business ceases, and occupations rest. And so over the loss of the light there is mourning.&#160; But yet it again revives, with its own beauty, its own dowry, is own sun, the same as ever, whole and entire, over all the world, slaying its own death, night&#8212;opening its own sepulchre, the darkness&#8212;coming forth the heir to itself, until the night also revives&#8212;it, too, accompanied with a retinue of its own. For the stellar rays are rekindled, which had been quenched in the morning glow; the distant groups of the constellations are again brought back to view, which the <i>day&#146;s</i> temporary interval had removed out of sight. Readorned also are the mirrors of the moon, which her monthly course had worn away.&#160; Winters and summers return, as do the spring-tide and autumn, with their resources, their routines, their fruits.&#160; Forasmuch as earth receives its instruction from heaven to clothe the trees which had been stripped, to colour the flowers afresh, to spread the grass again, to reproduce the seed which had been consumed, and not to reproduce them until consumed. Wondrous method! from a defrauder to be a preserver, in order to restore, it takes away; in order to guard, it destroys; that it may make whole, it injures; and that it may enlarge, it first lessens. (This process) indeed, renders back to us richer and fuller blessings than it deprived us of&#8212;by a destruction which is profit, by an injury which is advantage, and by a loss which is gain.&#160; In a word, I would say, all creation is instinct with renewal. Whatever you may chance upon, has already existed; whatever you have lost, returns again without fail. All things return to their former state, after having gone out of sight; all things begin after they have ended; they come to an end for the very purpose of coming into existence again. Nothing perishes but with a view to salvation. The whole, therefore, of this revolving order of things bears witness to the resurrection of the dead. In His works did God write it, before He wrote it in the Scriptures; He proclaimed it in His mighty deeds earlier than in His inspired words. He first sent Nature to you as a teacher, meaning to send Prophecy also as a supplemental instructor, that, being Nature&#146;s disciple, you may more easily believe Prophecy, and without hesitation accept (its testimony) when you come to hear what you have seen already on every side; nor doubt that <A NAME="page_554"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 554</FONT></A> <a name="v.viii.xii-Page_554"></A>God, whom you have discovered to be the restorer of all things, is likewise the reviver of the flesh. And surely, as all things rise again for man, for whose use they have been provided&#8212;but not for man except for his flesh also&#8212;how happens it that (the flesh) itself can perish utterly, because of which and for the service of which nothing comes to nought?</p>
