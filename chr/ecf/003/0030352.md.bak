<span id="v.iv.iii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Man, Endued with Liberty,
Superior to the Angels, Overcomes Even the Angel Which Lured Him to His
Fall, When Repentant and Resuming Obedience to God.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.viii-p2"></span>For it was not merely that he might
live the natural life that God had produced man, but <span
id="fr_2808"></span>[2809](#fn_2808.md) that he should live virtuously,
that is, in relation to God and to His law. Accordingly, God gave him
*to live* when he was formed into a living soul; but He charged him *to
live virtuously* when he was required to obey a law. So also God shows
that man was not constituted for death, by now wishing that he should be
restored to life, preferring the sinner’s repentance to his death. <span
id="fr_2809"></span>[2810](#fn_2809.md) As, therefore, God designed for man
a condition of life, so man brought on himself a state of death; and
this, too, neither through infirmity nor through ignorance, so that no
blame can be imputed to the Creator. No doubt it was an angel who was
the seducer; but then the victim of that seduction was free, and master
of himself; <span id="page_304">p. 304</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.viii-Page_304"></span>and as being the image and likeness
of God, was stronger than any angel; and as being, too, the *afflatus*
of the Divine Being, was nobler than that material spirit of which
angels were made. *Who maketh*, says he, *His angels spirits, and His
ministers a flame of fire*. <span id="fr_2810"></span>[2811](#fn_2810.md)
He would not have made all things subject to man, if he had been too
weak for the dominion, and inferior to the angels, to whom He assigned
no such subjects; nor would He have put the burden of law upon him, if
he had been incapable of sustaining so great a weight; nor, again, would
He have threatened with the penalty of death a creature whom He knew to
be guiltless on the score of his helplessness:  in short, if He had made
him infirm, it would not have been by liberty and independence of will,
but rather by the withholding from him these endowments. And thus it
comes to pass, that even now also, the same human being, the same
substance of his soul, the same condition as Adam’s, is made conqueror
over the same devil by the self-same liberty and power of his will, when
it moves in obedience to the laws of God. <span
