<span id="vi.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Primeval Hovering of the
Spirit of God Over the Waters Typical of Baptism. The Universal Element
of Water Thus Made a Channel of Sanctification. Resemblance Between the
Outward Sign and the Inward Grace.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p2"></span>But it will suffice to have *thus* called
at the outset those points in which withal is recognised that primary
principle of baptism,—which was even then fore-noted by the very
attitude *assumed* for a type of baptism,—that the Spirit of God, who
hovered over (the waters) from the beginning, would continue to linger
over the waters of the baptized. <span
id="fr_8561"></span>[8562](#fn_8561.md) But a holy thing, of course,
hovered over a holy; or else, from that which hovered over that which
*was* hovered over borrowed a holiness, since it is necessary that in
every case an underlying material substance should catch the quality of
that which overhangs it, most of all a corporeal of a spiritual, adapted
(as the spiritual is) through the subtleness of its substance, both for
penetrating and insinuating. Thus the nature of the waters, sanctified
by the Holy One, itself conceived withal the power of sanctifying. Let
no one say, “Why then, are we, pray, baptized with the very waters which
then existed in the first beginning?” Not with those waters, of course,
except in so far as the *genus* indeed is one, but the *species* very
many. But what is an attribute to the *genus* reappears <span
id="fr_8562"></span>[8563](#fn_8562.md) likewise in the *species*. And
accordingly it makes no <span id="page_671">p. 671</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iv-Page_671"></span>difference whether a man be washed in a
sea or a pool, a stream or a fount, a lake or a trough; <span
id="fr_8563"></span>[8564](#fn_8563.md) nor is there any distinction
between those whom John baptized in the Jordan and those whom Peter
baptized in the Tiber, unless withal the eunuch whom Philip baptized in
the midst of his journeys with chance water, derived (therefrom) more or
less of salvation *than others*. <span
id="fr_8564"></span>[8565](#fn_8564.md) All waters, therefore, in virtue of
the pristine privilege of their origin, do, after invocation of God,
attain the sacramental power of sanctification; for the Spirit
immediately supervenes from the heavens, and rests over the waters,
sanctifying them from Himself; and being thus sanctified, they imbibe at
the same time the power of sanctifying. Albeit the similitude may be
admitted to be suitable to the simple act; that, since we are defiled by
sins, as it were by dirt, we should be washed from those stains in
waters. But as sins do not show themselves in our *flesh* (inasmuch as
no one carries on his skin the spot of idolatry, or fornication, or
fraud), so persons of that kind are foul in the *spirit*, which is the
author of the sin; for the spirit is lord, the flesh servant. Yet they
each mutually share the guilt: the spirit, on the ground of command; the
flesh, of subservience. Therefore, after the waters have been in a
manner endued with medicinal virtue <span
id="fr_8565"></span>[8566](#fn_8565.md) through the intervention of the
angel, <span id="fr_8566"></span>[8567](#fn_8566.md) the spirit is
corporeally washed in the waters, and the flesh is in the same
spiritually cleansed.
