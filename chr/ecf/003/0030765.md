id="vi.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Of Virgins.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi-p2"></span>But that point which is promiscuously
observed throughout the churches, whether virgins ought to be veiled or
no, must be treated of. For they who allow to virgins immunity from
head-covering, appear to rest on this; that the apostle has not defined
“virgins” by name, but “women,” <span
id="fr_8872"></span>[8873](#fn_8872.md) as “to be veiled;” nor the sex
generally, so as to say “females,” but a *class* of the sex, by saying
“women:” for if he had named the sex by saying “females,” he would have
made his limit absolute for *every* woman; but while he names one class
of the sex, he separates another class by being silent. For, they say,
he might either have named “virgins” specially; or generally, by a
compendious term, “females.”
