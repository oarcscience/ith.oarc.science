<span id="iv.vi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.x-p2"></span>So, when you allege that the ornaments of
the heathen deities are found no less with God, with the object of
claiming among these for general use the head-crown, you already lay it
down for yourself, that we must not have among us, as a thing whose use
we are to share with others, what is not to be found in the service of
God. Well, what is so unworthy of God indeed as that which is worthy of
an idol? But what is so worthy of an idol as that which is also worthy
of a dead man? For it is the privilege of the dead also to be thus
crowned, as they too straightway become idols, both by their dress and
the service of deification, which (deification) is with us a second
idolatry. Wanting, then, the sense, it will be theirs to use the thing
for which the sense is wanting, just as if in full possession of the
sense they wished to abuse it.  When there ceases to be any reality in
the use, there is no distinction between using and abusing. Who can
abuse a thing, when the precipient nature with which he wishes to carry
out his purpose is not his to use it? The apostle, moreover, forbids us
to abuse, while he would more naturally have taught us not to use,
unless on the ground that, where there is no sense for things, there is
no wrong use of them.  But the whole affair is meaningless, and is, in
fact, a dead work so far as concerns the idols; though, without doubt, a
living one as respects the demons <span
id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) to whom the religious rite belongs.
“The idols of the heathen,” says David, “are silver and gold.” “They
have eyes, and see not; a nose, and <span id="page_99">p. 99</span>
<span id="iv.vi.x-Page_99"></span>smell not; hands, and they will not
handle.” <span id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md) By means of these
organs, indeed, we are to enjoy flowers; but if he declares that those
who make idols will be like them, they already are so who use anything
after the style of idol adornings. “To the pure all things are pure: so,
likewise, all things to the impure are impure;” <span
id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md) but nothing is more impure than
idols.  The substances are themselves as creatures of God without
impurity, and in this their native state are free to the use of all; but
the ministries to which in their use they are devoted, makes all the
difference; for I, too, kill a cock for myself, just as Socrates did for
Æsculapius; and if the smell of some place or other offends me, I burn
the Arabian product myself, but not with the same ceremony, nor in the
same dress, nor with the same pomp, with which it is done to
idols. <span id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md) If the creature is
defiled by a mere word, as the apostle teaches, “But if any one say,
This is offered in sacrifice to idols, you must not touch it,” <span
id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md) much more when it is polluted by the
dress, and rites, and pomp of what is offered to the gods. Thus the
crown also is made out to be an offering to idols; <span
id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) for with this ceremony, and dress, and
pomp, it is presented in sacrifice to idols, its originators, to whom
its use is specially given over, and chiefly on this account, that what
has no place among the things of God may not be admitted into use with
us as with others.  Wherefore the apostle exclaims, “Flee
idolatry:” <span id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md) certainly idolatry
whole and entire he means. Reflect on what a thicket it is, and how many
thorns lie hid in it.  Nothing must be given to an idol, and so nothing
must be taken from one. If it is inconsistent with faith to recline in
an idol temple, what is it to appear in an idol dress? What communion
have Christ and Belial? Therefore flee from it; for he enjoins us to
keep at a distance from idolatry—to have no close dealings with it of
any kind. Even an earthly serpent sucks in men at some distance with its
breath.  Going still further, John says, “My little children, keep
yourselves from idols,” <span id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) —not now
from idolatry, as if from the service of it, but from idols—that is,
from any resemblance to them: for it is an unworthy thing that you, the
image of the living God, should become the likeness of an idol and a
dead man. Thus far we assert, that this attire belongs to idols, both
from the history of its origin, and from its use by false religion; on
this ground, besides, that while it is not mentioned as connected with
the worship of God, it is more and more given over to those in whose
antiquities, as well as festivals and services, it is found. In a word,
the very doors, the very victims and altars, the very servants and
priests, are crowned. You have, in Claudius, the crowns of all the
various colleges of priests. We have added also that distinction between
things altogether different from each other—things, namely, agreeable,
and things contrary to reason—in answer to those who, because there
happens to be the use of some things in common, maintain the right of
participation in all things. With reference to this part of the subject,
therefore, it now remains that the special grounds for wearing crowns
should be examined, that while we show these to be foreign, nay, even
opposed to our Christian discipline, we may demonstrate that none of
them have any plea of reason to support it, on the basis of which this
article of dress might be vindicated as one in whose use we can
participate, as even some others may whose instances are cast up to us.
