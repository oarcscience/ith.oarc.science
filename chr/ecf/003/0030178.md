<span id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII. <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080) —Conclusion, the Romans Owe Not
Their Imperial Power to Their Gods. The Great God Alone Dispenses
Kingdoms, He is the God of the Christians.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-p3"></span>In conclusion, without denying all
those whom antiquity willed *and* posterity has believed to be gods, to
be the guardians of your religion, there yet remains for our
consideration that very large assumption of the Roman superstitions
which we have to meet in opposition to you, O heathen, viz. that the
Romans have become the lords and masters of the whole world, because by
their religious offices they have merited this dominion to such an
extent that they are within a very little of excelling even their own
gods in power. One cannot wonder that Sterculus, and Mutunus, and
Larentina, have severally <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081)
advanced this empire to its height! The Roman people has been by its
gods alone ordained to such dominion. For I could not imagine that any
foreign *gods* would have preferred doing more for a strange nation than
for their own people, and so by such conduct become the deserters and
neglecters, nay, the betrayers of the native land wherein they were born
and bred, and ennobled and buried.  Thus not even Jupiter <span
id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-Page_146"></span>could suffer his own Crete to be
subdued by the Roman fasces, forgetting that cave of Ida, and the brazen
cymbals of the Corybantes, and the most pleasant odour of *the goat*
which nursed him on that *dear* spot. Would he not have made that tomb
of his superior to the whole Capitol, so that that land should most
widely rule which covered the ashes of Jupiter?  Would Juno, *too*, be
willing that the Punic city, for the love of which she even neglected
Samos, should be destroyed, and that, too, by the fires of the sons of
Æneas? Although I am well aware that

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-p5"></span>“Hic illius arma,

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-p6"></span>Hic currus fuit, hoc regnum des
gentibus esse,

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-p7"></span>Si qua fata sinant, jam tunc
tenditque fovetque.” <span id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082)

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-p9"></span>“Here were her arms, her chariot
here,

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-p10"></span>Here goddess-like, to fix one day

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-p11"></span>The seat of universal sway,

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-p12"></span>Might fate be wrung to yield
assent,

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-p13"></span>E’en then her schemes, her cares
were bent.” <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083)

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-p15"></span>*Still* the unhappy (queen of
gods) had no power against the fates! And yet the Romans did not accord
as much honour to the fates, although they gave them Carthage, as they
did to Larentina. But surely those gods of yours have not the power of
conferring empire. For when Jupiter reigned in Crete, and Saturn in
Italy, and Isis in Egypt, it was even as men that they reigned, to whom
also were assigned many to assist them. <span
id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084) Thus he who serves also makes
masters, and the bond-slave <span id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085)
of Admetus <span id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086) aggrandizes with
empire the citizens of Rome, although he destroyed his own liberal
votary Crœsus by deceiving him with ambiguous oracles. <span
id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087) Being a god, why was he afraid
boldly to foretell to him the truth that he must lose his kingdom.
Surely those who were aggrandized with the power of wielding empire
might always have been able to keep an eye, as it were, <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088) on their own cities. If they were
strong enough to confer empire on the Romans, why did not Minerva defend
Athens from Xerxes? Or why did not Apollo rescue Delphi out of the hand
of Pyrrhus? They who lost their own cities preserve the city of Rome,
since (forsooth) the religiousness <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089) of Rome has merited the protection!
But is it not rather the fact that this excessive devotion <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090) has been devised since the empire
has attained its glory by the increase of its power? No doubt sacred
rites were introduced by Numa, but then your proceedings were not marred
by a religion of idols and temples. Piety was simple, <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091) and worship humble; altars were
artlessly reared, <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092) and the
vessels (thereof) plain, and the incense from them scant, and the god
himself nowhere. Men therefore were not religious before they achieved
greatness, (nor great) because they were religious. But how can the
Romans possibly seem to have acquired their empire by an excessive
religiousness and very profound respect for the gods, when that empire
was rather increased after the gods had been slighted? <span
id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093) Now, if I am not mistaken, every
kingdom or empire is acquired and enlarged by wars, whilst they and
their gods also are injured by conquerors. For the same ruin affects
both city-walls and temples; similar is the carnage both of civilians
and of priests; identical the plunder of profane things and of sacred.
To the Romans belong as many sacrileges as trophies; and then as many
triumphs over gods as over nations. Still remaining are their captive
idols amongst them; and certainly, if they can only see their
conquerors, they do not give them their love. Since, however, they have
no perception, they are injured with impunity; and since they are
injured with impunity, they are worshipped to no purpose. The nation,
therefore, which has grown to its powerful height by victory after
victory, cannot seem to have developed owing to the merits of its
religion—whether they have injured the religion by augmenting their
power, or augmented their power by injuring the religion. All nations
have possessed empire, each in its proper time, as the Assyrians, the
Medes, the Persians, the Egyptians; empire is even now also in the
possession of some, and yet they that have lost their power used not to
behave <span id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094) without attention to
religious services and the worship of the gods, even after these had
become unpropitious to them, <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095)
until at last almost universal dominion has accrued to the Romans. It is
the fortune of the times that has thus constantly shaken kingdoms with
revolution. <span id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096) Inquire who has
ordained these changes in the times. It is the same (great Being) who
dispenses kingdoms, <span id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097) and has
now put the supremacy of them into the hands of the Ro<span
id="page_147">p. 147</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xvii-Page_147"></span>mans, very much as if <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098) the tribute of many nations were
after its exaction amassed in one (vast) coffer. What He has determined
concerning it, they know who are the nearest to Him. <span

are well aware of God’s purposes as declared in prophecy.  St. Paul
tells the Thessalonians what the order of the great events subsequent to
the Roman power was to be:  the destruction of that power was to be
followed by the development and reign of Antichrist; and then the end of
the world would come.
