<span id="v.vi.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—Indignant Irony Exposing the
Valentinian Fable About the Judicial Treatment of Mankind at the Last
Judgment. The Immorality of the Doctrine.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxii-p2"></span>As for the human race, its end will be
to the following effect:—To all which bear the earthy <span
id="fr_6901"></span>[6902](#fn_6901.md) and material mark there accrues an
entire destruction, because “all flesh is grass,” <span
id="fr_6902"></span>[6903](#fn_6902.md) and amongst these is the soul of
mortal man, except when it has found salvation by faith. The souls of
just men, that is to say, our souls, will be conveyed to the Demiurge in
the abodes of the middle region. We are duly thankful; we shall be
content to be classed with our god, in whom lies our own origin. <span
id="fr_6903"></span>[6904](#fn_6903.md) Into the palace of the Pleroma
nothing of the animal nature is admitted—nothing but the spiritual swarm
of Valentinus. There, then, the first process is the despoiling of men
themselves, that is, men within the Pleroma. <span
id="fr_6904"></span>[6905](#fn_6904.md) Now this despoiling consists of the
putting off of the souls in which they appear to be clothed, which they
will give back to their Demiurge as they had obtained <span
id="fr_6905"></span>[6906](#fn_6905.md) them from him. They will then
become wholly intellectual spirits—impalpable, <span
id="fr_6906"></span>[6907](#fn_6906.md) invisible <span
id="fr_6907"></span>[6908](#fn_6907.md) —and in this state will be
readmitted invisibly to the Pleroma—stealthily, if the case admits of
the idea. <span id="fr_6908"></span>[6909](#fn_6908.md) What then?  They
will be dispersed amongst the angels, the attendants on Soter. As sons,
do you suppose? Not at all.  As servants, then? No, not even so. Well,
as phantoms? Would that it were nothing more! Then in what capacity, if
you are ashamed to tell us? In the capacity of brides. Then will they
end <span id="fr_6909"></span>[6910](#fn_6909.md) their Sabine rapes with
the sanction of wedlock. This will be the guerdon of the spiritual, this
the recompense of their faith! Such fables have their use. Although but
a Marcus or a Gaius, <span id="fr_6910"></span>[6911](#fn_6910.md)
full-grown in this flesh of ours, with a beard and such like proofs (of
virility,) it may be a stern husband, a father, a grandfather, a
great-grandfather (never mind what, in fact, if only a male), you may
perhaps in the bridal-chamber of the Pleroma—I have already said so
tacitly <span id="fr_6911"></span>[6912](#fn_6911.md) —even become the
parent by an angel of some Æon of high numerical rank. <span
id="fr_6912"></span>[6913](#fn_6912.md) For the right celebration of these
nuptials, instead of the torch and veil, I suppose that secret fire is
then to burst forth, which, after devastating the whole existence of
things, will itself also be reduced to nothing at last, after everything
has been reduced to ashes; and so their fable too will be ended. <span
id="fr_6913"></span>[6914](#fn_6913.md) But I, too, <span id="page_519">p.
519</span> <span id="v.vi.xxxii-Page_519"></span>am no doubt a rash man,
in having exposed so great a mystery in so derisive a way: I ought to be
afraid that Achamoth, who did not choose to make herself known even to
her own son, would turn mad, that Theletus would be enraged, that
Fortune <span id="fr_6914"></span>[6915](#fn_6914.md) would be irritated.
But I am yet a liege-man of the Demiurge. I have to return after death
to the place where there is no more giving in marriage, where I have to
be clothed upon rather than to be despoiled,—where, even if I am
despoiled of my sex, I am classed with angels—not a male angel, nor a
female one. There will be no one to do aught against me, nor will they
then find any male energy in me.

<span id="v.vi.xxxii-p13"></span> This parenthetic clause, “tacendo jam
dixi,” perhaps means, “I say this with shame,” “I would rather not have
to say it.”

id="v.vi.xxxii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxii-p14"></span> The common reading is, “Onesimum
Æonem,” an Æon called Onesimus, in supposed allusion to Philemon’s
Onesimus. But this is too far-fetched. Oehler discovers in “Onesimum”
the corruption of some higher number ending in “esimum.”

<span id="fn_6913"></span>[518:6914](0030547.htm#fr_6913.md) <span
id="v.vi.xxxii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxii-p15"></span> This is Oehler’s idea of “et nulla jam
fabula.” Rigaltius, however, gives a good sense to this clause: “All
will come true at last; there will be no fable.”
