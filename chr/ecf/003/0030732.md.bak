<span id="vi.iii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Of John’s Baptism.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x-p2"></span>We have spoken, so far as our moderate
ability permitted, of the *generals* which form the groundwork of the
sanctity <span id="fr_8635"></span>[8636](#fn_8635.md) of baptism. I will
now, equally to the best of my power, proceed to the rest of its
character, touching certain minor questions.

<span id="vi.iii.x-p4"></span>The baptism announced by John formed the
subject, even at that time, of a question, proposed by the Lord Himself
indeed to the Pharisees, whether that baptism were heavenly, or truly
earthly: <span id="fr_8636"></span>[8637](#fn_8636.md) about which they
were unable to give a consistent <span
id="fr_8637"></span>[8638](#fn_8637.md) answer, <span id="page_674">p.
674</span> <span id="vi.iii.x-Page_674"></span>inasmuch as they
understood not, because they believed not. But *we*, with but as poor a
measure of understanding as of faith, *are* able to determine that that
baptism was *divine* indeed, (yet in respect of the command, not in
respect of efficacy <span id="fr_8638"></span>[8639](#fn_8638.md) too, in
that we read that John was *sent by the Lord* to perform this
duty,) <span id="fr_8639"></span>[8640](#fn_8639.md) but *human* in its
nature: for it conveyed nothing celestial, but it fore-ministered to
things celestial; being, to wit, appointed over *repentance*, which is
in man’s power. <span id="fr_8640"></span>[8641](#fn_8640.md) In fact, the
doctors of the law and the Pharisees, who were unwilling to “believe,”
did not “repent” either. <span id="fr_8641"></span>[8642](#fn_8641.md) But
if repentance is a thing human, its baptism must necessarily be of the
same nature:  else, if it had been celestial, it would have given both
the Holy Spirit and remission of sins. But none either pardons sins or
freely grants the Spirit save God only. <span
id="fr_8642"></span>[8643](#fn_8642.md) Even the Lord Himself said that the
Spirit would not descend on any other condition, but that He should
first ascend to the Father. <span id="fr_8643"></span>[8644](#fn_8643.md)
What the Lord was not yet conferring, of course the servant could not
furnish.  Accordingly, in the Acts of the Apostles, we find that men who
had “John’s baptism” had not received the Holy Spirit, whom they knew
not even by hearing. <span id="fr_8644"></span>[8645](#fn_8644.md) That,
then, was no celestial thing which furnished no celestial (endowments): 
whereas the very thing which *was* celestial in John—the Spirit of
prophecy—so completely failed, after the transfer of the whole Spirit to
the Lord, that he presently sent to inquire whether He whom he had
himself preached, <span id="fr_8645"></span>[8646](#fn_8645.md) whom he had
pointed out when coming to him, were “HE.” <span
id="fr_8646"></span>[8647](#fn_8646.md) And so “the baptism of
repentance” <span id="fr_8647"></span>[8648](#fn_8647.md) was dealt
with <span id="fr_8648"></span>[8649](#fn_8648.md) as if it were a
candidate for the remission and sanctification shortly about to follow
in Christ: for in that John used to preach “baptism *for* the remission
of sins,” <span id="fr_8649"></span>[8650](#fn_8649.md) the declaration was
made with reference to *future* remission; if it be true, (as it is,)
that repentance is antecedent, remission subsequent; and this is
“preparing the way.” <span id="fr_8650"></span>[8651](#fn_8650.md) But he
who “prepares” does not himself “perfect,” but procures for another to
perfect.  John himself professes that the celestial things are not his,
but Christ’s, by saying, “He who is from the earth speaketh concerning
the earth; He who comes from the *realms* above is above all;” <span
id="fr_8651"></span>[8652](#fn_8651.md) and again, by saying that he
“baptized in repentance only, but that One would shortly come who would
baptize in the Spirit and fire;” <span
id="fr_8652"></span>[8653](#fn_8652.md) —of course because true and stable
faith is baptized with *water*, unto salvation; pretended and weak faith
is baptized with *fire*, unto judgment.
