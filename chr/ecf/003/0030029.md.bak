<span id="iv.iii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxiii-p2"></span>Moreover, if sorcerers call forth
ghosts, and even make what seem the souls of the dead to appear; if they
put boys to death, in order to get a response from the oracle; if, with
their juggling illusions, they make a pretence of doing various
miracles; if they put dreams into people’s minds by the power of the
angels and demons whose aid they have invited, by whose influence, too,
goats and tables are made to divine,—how much more likely is this power
of evil to be zealous in doing with all its might, of its own
inclination, and for its own objects, what it does to serve the ends of
others! Or if both angels and demons do just what your gods do, where in
that case is the pre-eminence of deity, which we must surely think to be
above all in might? Will it not then be more reasonable to hold that
these spirits make themselves gods, giving as they do the very proofs
which raise your gods to godhead, than that the gods are the equals of
angels and demons? You make a distinction of places, I suppose,
regarding as gods in their temple those whose divinity you do not
recognize elsewhere; counting the madness which leads one man to leap
from the sacred houses, to be something different from that which leads
another to leap from an adjoining house; looking on one who cuts his
arms and secret parts as under a different furor from another who cuts
his throat. The result of the frenzy is the same, and the manner of
instigation is one. But thus far we have been dealing only in words:  we
now proceed to a proof of facts, in which we shall show that under
different names you have real identity.  Let a person be brought before
your tribunals, who is plainly under demoniacal possession. The wicked
spirit, bidden to speak by a follower of Christ, <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) will as readily make the truthful
confession that he is a demon, as elsewhere he has falsely asserted that
he is a god.  Or, if you will, let there be produced one of the
god-possessed, as they are supposed, who, inhaling at the altar,
conceive divinity from the fumes, who are delivered of it by retching,
who vent it forth in agonies of gasping. Let that same Virgin Cælestis
herself the rain-promiser, let Æsculapius discoverer of medicines, ready
to prolong the life of Socordius, and Tenatius, and Asclepiodotus, now
in the last extremity, if they would not confess, in their fear of lying
to a Christian, that they were demons, then and there shed the blood of
that most impudent follower of Christ. What clearer than a work like
that? what more trustworthy than such a proof?  The simplicity of truth
is thus set forth; its own worth sustains it; no ground remains for the
least suspicion.  Do you say that it is done by magic, or some trick of
that sort? You will not say anything of the sort, if you have been
allowed the use of your ears and eyes. For what argument can you bring
against a thing that is exhibited to the eye in its naked reality? If,
on the one hand, they are really gods, why do they pretend to be demons?
Is it from fear of us? In that case your divinity is put in subjection
to Christians; and you surely can never ascribe deity to that which is
under authority of man, nay (if it adds aught to the disgrace) of its
very enemies. If, on the other hand, they are demons or angels, why,
inconsistently with this, do <span id="page_38">p. 38</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xxiii-Page_38"></span>they presume to set themselves forth as
acting the part of gods?  For as beings who put themselves out as gods
would never willingly call themselves demons, if they were gods indeed,
that they might not thereby in fact abdicate their dignity; so those
whom you know to be no more than demons, would not dare to act as gods,
if those whose names they take and use were really divine. For they
would not dare to treat with disrespect the higher majesty of beings,
whose displeasure they would feel was to be dreaded. So this divinity of
yours is no divinity; for if it were, it would not be pretended to by
demons, and it would not be denied by gods.  But since on both sides
there is a concurrent acknowledgment that they are not gods, gather from
this that there is but a single race—I mean the race of demons, the real
race in both cases.  Let your search, then, now be after gods; for those
whom you had imagined to be so you find to be spirits of evil. The truth
is, as we have thus not only shown from our own gods that neither
themselves nor any others have claims to deity, you may see at once who
is really God, and whether that is He and He alone whom we Christians
own; as also whether you are to believe in Him, and worship Him, after
the manner of our Christian faith and discipline. But at once they will
say, Who is this Christ with his fables? is he an ordinary man? is he a
sorcerer? was his body stolen by his disciples from its tomb? is he now
in the realms below? or is he not rather up in the heavens, thence about
to come again, making the whole world shake, filling the earth with
dread alarms, making all but Christians wail—as the Power of God, and
the Spirit of God, as the Word, the Reason, the Wisdom, and the Son of
God? Mock as you like, but get the demons if you can to join you in your
mocking; let *them* deny that Christ is coming to judge every human soul
which has existed from the world’s beginning, clothing it again with the
body it laid aside at death; let *them* declare it, say, before your
tribunal, that this work has been allotted to Minos and Rhadamanthus, as
Plato and the poets agree; let them put away from them at least the mark
of ignominy and condemnation. They disclaim being unclean spirits, which
yet we must hold as indubitably proved by their relish for the blood and
fumes and fœtid carcasses of sacrificial animals, and even by the vile
language of their ministers. Let them deny that, for their wickedness
condemned already, they are kept for that very judgment-day, with all
their worshippers and their works.  Why, all the authority and power we
have over them is from our naming the name of Christ, and recalling to
their memory the woes with which God threatens them at the hands of
Christ as Judge, and which they expect one day to overtake them. Fearing
Christ in God, and God in Christ, they become subject to the servants of
God and Christ. So at our touch and breathing, overwhelmed by the
thought and realization of those judgment fires, they leave at our
command the bodies they have entered, unwilling, and distressed, and
before your very eyes put to an open shame. You believe them when they
lie; give credit to them, then, when they speak the truth about
themselves. No one plays the liar to bring disgrace upon his own head,
but for the sake of honour rather. You give a readier confidence to
people making confessions against themselves, than denials in their own
behalf. It has not been an unusual thing, accordingly, for those
testimonies of your deities to convert men to Christianity; for in
giving full belief to them, we are led to believe in Christ. Yes, your
very gods kindle up faith in our Scriptures, they build up the
confidence of our hope. You do homage, as I know, to them also with the
blood of Christians. On no account, then, would they lose those who are
so useful and dutiful to them, anxious even to hold you fast, lest some
day or other as Christians you might put them to the rout,—if under the
power of a follower of Christ, who desires to prove to you the Truth, it
were at all possible for them to lie.
