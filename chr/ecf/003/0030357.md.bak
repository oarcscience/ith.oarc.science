<span id="v.iv.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Further Description of the
Divine Justice; Since the Fall of Man It Has Regulated the Divine
Goodness. God’s Claims on Our Love and Our Fear Reconciled.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xiii-p2"></span>But yet, when evil afterwards broke
out, and the goodness of God began now to have an adversary to contend
against, God’s justice also acquired another function, even that of
directing His goodness according to men’s application for it. <span
id="fr_2856"></span>[2857](#fn_2856.md) And this is the result: the divine
goodness, being interrupted in that free course whereby God was
spontaneously good, is now dispensed according to the deserts of every
man; it is offered to the worthy, denied to the unworthy, taken away
from the unthankful, and also avenged on all its enemies. Thus the
entire office of justice in this respect becomes an agency <span
id="fr_2857"></span>[2858](#fn_2857.md) for goodness: whatever it condemns
by its judgment, whatever it chastises by its condemnation, whatever (to
use your phrase) it ruthlessly pursues, <span
id="fr_2858"></span>[2859](#fn_2858.md) it, in fact, benefits with good
instead of injuring. Indeed, the fear of judgment contributes to good,
not to evil. For good, now contending with an enemy, was not strong
enough to recommend itself <span id="fr_2859"></span>[2860](#fn_2859.md) by
itself alone. At all events, if it could do *so much*, it could not keep
its ground; for it had lost its impregnability through the foe, unless
some power of fear supervened, such as might compel the very unwilling
to seek after good, and take care of it. But who, when so many
incentives to evil were assailing him, would desire that good, which he
could despise with impunity? Who, again, would take care of what he
could lose without danger? You read how broad is the road to evil, <span
id="fr_2860"></span>[2861](#fn_2860.md) how thronged in comparison with the
opposite:  would not all glide down that road were there nothing in it
to fear? We dread the Creator’s tremendous threats, and yet scarcely
turn away from <span id="page_308">p. 308</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.xiii-Page_308"></span>evil. What, if He threatened not?
Will you call this justice an evil, when it is all unfavourable to evil?
Will you deny it to be a good, when it has its eye towards <span
id="fr_2861"></span>[2862](#fn_2861.md) good? What sort of being ought you
to wish God to be? Would it be right to prefer that He should be such,
that sins might flourish under Him, and the devil make mock at Him?
Would you suppose Him to be a good God, who should be able to make a man
worse by security in sin? Who is the author of good, but He who also
requires it? In like manner who is a stranger to evil, except Him who is
its enemy? Who its enemy, besides Him who is its conqueror? Who else its
conqueror, than He who is its punisher? Thus God is wholly good, because
in all things He is on the side of good. In fact, He is omnipotent,
because able both to help and to hurt. Merely to profit is a
comparatively small matter, because it can do nothing else than a good
turn. From such a conduct <span id="fr_2862"></span>[2863](#fn_2862.md)
with what confidence can I hope for good, if this is its only ability?
How can I follow after the reward of innocence, if I have no regard to
the requital of wrong-doing? I must needs have my doubts whether he
might not fail in recompensing one or other alternative, who was unequal
in his resources to meet both. Thus far, then, justice is the very
fulness of the Deity Himself, manifesting God as both a perfect father
and a perfect master: a father in His mercy, a master in His discipline;
a father in the mildness of His power, a master in its severity; a
father who must be loved with dutiful affection, a master who must needs
be feared; be loved, because He prefers mercy to sacrifice; <span
id="fr_2863"></span>[2864](#fn_2863.md) be feared because He dislikes sin;
be loved, because He prefers the sinner’s repentance to his death; <span
id="fr_2864"></span>[2865](#fn_2864.md) be feared, because He dislikes the
sinners who do not repent. Accordingly, the divine law enjoins duties in
respect of both these attributes: *Thou shalt love God*, and, *Thou
shalt fear God*. It proposed one for the obedient man, the other for the
transgressor. <span id="fr_2865"></span>[2866](#fn_2865.md)
