id="iv.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.v-p2"></span>The argument for Christian practices
becomes all the stronger, when also nature, which is the first rule of
all, supports them. Well, she is the first who lays it down that a crown
does not become the head. But I think ours is the God of nature, who
fashioned man; and, that he might desire, (appreciate, become partaker
of) the pleasures afforded by His creatures, endowed him with certain
senses, (acting) through members, which, so to speak, are their peculiar
instruments. The sense of hearing he has planted in the ears; that of
sight, lighted up in the eyes; that of taste, shut up in the mouth; that
of smell, wafted into the nose; that of touch, fixed in the tips of the
fingers. By means of these organs of the outer man doing duty to the
inner man, the enjoyments of the divine gifts are conveyed by the senses
to the soul. <span id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md) What, then, in
flowers affords you enjoyment? <span id="page_96">p. 96</span> <span
id="iv.vi.v-Page_96"></span>For it is the flowers of the field which are
the peculiar, at least the chief, material of crowns. Either smell, you
say, or colour, or both together. What will be the senses of colour and
smell? Those of seeing and smelling, I suppose. What members have had
these senses allotted to them? The eyes and the nose, if I am not
mistaken.  With sight and smell, then, make use of flowers, for these
are the senses by which they are meant to be enjoyed; use them by means
of the eyes and nose, which are the members to which these senses
belong. You have got the thing from God, the mode of it from the world;
but an extraordinary mode does not prevent the use of the thing in the
common way. Let flowers, then, both when fastened into each other and
tied together in thread and rush, be what they are when free, when
loose—things to be looked at and smelt. You count it a crown, let us
say, when you have a bunch of them bound together in a series, that you
may carry many at one time that you may enjoy them all at once.  Well,
lay them in your bosom if they are so singularly pure, and strew them on
your couch if they are so exquisitely soft, and consign them to your cup
if they are so perfectly harmless.  Have the pleasure of them in as many
ways as they appeal to your senses. But what taste for a flower, what
sense for anything belonging to a crown but its band, have you in the
head, which is able neither to distinguish colour, nor to inhale sweet
perfumes, nor to appreciate softness? It is as much against nature to
long after a flower with the head, as it is to crave food with the ear,
or sound with the nostril. But everything which is against nature
deserves to be branded as monstrous among all men; but with us it is to
be condemned also as sacrilege against God, the Lord and Creator of
nature.
