<span id="v.viii.lxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.lxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIII.—Conclusion. The
Resurrection of the Flesh in Its Absolute Identity and Perfection.
Belief of This Had Become Weak. Hopes for Its Refreshing Restoration
Under the Influences of the Paraclete.</span>

<span id="v.viii.lxiii-p2"></span>And so the flesh shall rise again,
wholly in every man, in its own identity, in its absolute integrity.
Wherever it may be, it is in safe keeping in God’s presence, through
that most faithful “Mediator between God and man, (the man) Jesus
Christ,” <span id="fr_7754"></span>[7755](#fn_7754.md) who shall reconcile
both God to man, and man to God; the spirit to the flesh, and the flesh
to the spirit. Both natures has He already united in His own self; He
has fitted them together as bride and bridegroom in the reciprocal bond
of wedded life. Now, if any should insist on making the soul the bride,
then the flesh will follow the soul as her dowry. The soul shall never
be an outcast, to be had home by the bridegroom bare and naked.  She has
her dower, her outfit, her fortune in the flesh, which shall accompany
her with the love and fidelity of a foster-sister. But suppose the flesh
to be the <span id="page_594">p. 594</span> <span
id="v.viii.lxiii-Page_594"></span>bride, then in Christ Jesus she has in
the contract of His blood received His Spirit as her spouse. Now, what
you take to be her extinction, you may be sure is only her temporary
retirement.  It is not the soul only which withdraws from view. The
flesh, too, has her departures for a while—in waters, in fires, in
birds, in beasts; she may seem to be dissolved into these, but she is
only poured into them, as into vessels. And should the vessels
themselves afterwards fail to hold her, escaping from even these, and
returning to her mother earth, she is absorbed once more, as it were, by
its secret embraces, ultimately to stand forth to view, like Adam when
summoned to hear from his Lord and Creator the words, “Behold, the man
is become as one of us!” <span id="fr_7755"></span>[7756](#fn_7755.md)
—thoroughly “knowing” by that time “the evil” which she had escaped,
“and the good” which she has acquired. Why, then, O soul, should you
envy the flesh? There is none, after the Lord, whom you should love so
dearly; none more like a brother to you, which is even born along with
yourself in God. You ought rather to have been by your prayers obtaining
resurrection for her: her sins, whatever they were, were owing to you. 
However, it is no wonder if you hate her; for you have repudiated her
Creator. <span id="fr_7756"></span>[7757](#fn_7756.md) You have accustomed
yourself either to deny or change her existence even in Christ <span
id="fr_7757"></span>[7758](#fn_7757.md) —corrupting the very Word of God
Himself, who became flesh, either by mutilating or misinterpreting the
Scripture, <span id="fr_7758"></span>[7759](#fn_7758.md) and introducing,
above all, apocryphal mysteries *and* blasphemous fables. <span
id="fr_7759"></span>[7760](#fn_7759.md) But yet Almighty God, in His most
gracious providence, by “pouring out of His Spirit in these last days,
upon all flesh, upon His servants and on His handmaidens,” <span
id="fr_7760"></span>[7761](#fn_7760.md) has checked these impostures of
unbelief and perverseness, reanimated men’s faltering faith in the
resurrection of the flesh, and cleared from all obscurity and
equivocation the ancient Scriptures (of both God’s Testaments <span
id="fr_7761"></span>[7762](#fn_7761) .md) by the clear light of their
(sacred) words and meanings. Now, since it was “needful that there
should be heresies, in order that they which are approved might be made
manifest;” <span id="fr_7762"></span>[7763](#fn_7762.md) since, however,
these heresies would be unable to put on a bold front without some
countenance from the Scriptures, it therefore is plain enough that the
ancient Holy Writ has furnished them with sundry materials for their
evil doctrine, which very materials indeed (so distorted) are refutable
from the same Scriptures. It was fit and proper, therefore, that the
Holy Ghost should no longer withhold the effusions of His gracious light
upon these inspired writings, in order that they might be able to
disseminate the seeds *of truth* with no admixture of heretical
subtleties, and pluck out from it their tares. He has accordingly now
dispersed all the perplexities of the past, and their self-chosen
allegories and parables, by the open and perspicuous explanation of the
entire mystery, through the new prophecy, which descends in copious
streams from the Paraclete. If you will only draw water from His
fountains, you will never thirst for other doctrine: no feverish craving
after subtle questions will again consume you; *but* by drinking in
evermore the resurrection of the flesh, you will be satisfied with the
refreshing draughts.
