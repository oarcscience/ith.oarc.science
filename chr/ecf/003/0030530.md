<span id="v.vi.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Strange Account of the Origin of
Matter, from the Various Affections of Achamoth.  The Waters from Her
Tears; Light from Her Smile.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xv-p2"></span>Well, now, the Pythagoreans may learn, the
Stoics may know, Plato himself (may discover), whence Matter, which they
will have to be unborn, derived both its origin and substance for all
this pile of the world—(a mystery) which not even the renowned <span
id="fr_6775"></span>[6776](#fn_6775.md) Mercurius Trismegistus, master (as
he was) of all <span id="page_512">p. 512</span> <span
id="v.vi.xv-Page_512"></span>physical philosophy, thought out. <span
id="fr_6776"></span>[6777](#fn_6776.md) You have just heard of
“Conversion,” one element in the “Passion” (we have so often mentioned).
Out of this the whole life of the world, <span
id="fr_6777"></span>[6778](#fn_6777.md) and even that of the Demiurge
himself, our God, is said to have had its being. Again, you have heard
of “sorrow” and “fear.” From these all other created things <span
id="fr_6778"></span>[6779](#fn_6778.md) took their beginning. For from
her <span id="fr_6779"></span>[6780](#fn_6779.md) tears flowed the entire
mass of waters.  From this circumstance one may form an idea of the
calamity <span id="fr_6780"></span>[6781](#fn_6780.md) which she
encountered, so vast were the kinds of the tears wherewith she
overflowed. She had salt tear-drops, she had bitter, and sweet, and
warm, and cold, and bituminous, and ferruginous, and sulphurous, and
even <span id="fr_6781"></span>[6782](#fn_6781.md) poisonous, so that the
Nonacris exuded therefrom which killed Alexander; and the river of the
Lyncestæ <span id="fr_6782"></span>[6783](#fn_6782.md) flowed from the same
source, which produces drunkenness; and the Salmacis <span
id="fr_6783"></span>[6784](#fn_6783.md) was derived from the same source,
which renders men effeminate. The rains of heaven Achamoth whimpered
forth, <span id="fr_6784"></span>[6785](#fn_6784.md) and we on our part are
anxiously employed in saving up in our cisterns the very wails and tears
of another. In like manner, from the “consternation” and “alarm” (of
which we have also heard), bodily elements were derived. And yet amidst
so many circumstances of solitude, in this vast prospect of destitution,
she occasionally smiled at the recollection of the sight of Christ, and
from this smile of joy light flashed forth.  How great was this
beneficence of Providence, which induced her to smile, and all that we
might not linger for ever in the dark! Nor need you feel astonished
how <span id="fr_6785"></span>[6786](#fn_6785.md) from her joy so splendid
an element <span id="fr_6786"></span>[6787](#fn_6786.md) could have beamed
upon the world, when from her sadness even so necessary a
provision <span id="fr_6787"></span>[6788](#fn_6787.md) flowed forth for
man. O illuminating smile! O irrigating tear! And yet it might now have
acted as some alleviation amidst the horror of her situation; for she
might have shaken off all the obscurity thereof as often as she had a
mind to smile, even not to be obliged to turn suppliant to those who had
deserted her. <span id="fr_6788"></span>[6789](#fn_6788.md)
