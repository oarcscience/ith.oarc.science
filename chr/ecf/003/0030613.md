<span id="v.viii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Other Passages Out of the
Prophets Applied to the Resurrection of the Flesh.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxxi-p2"></span>Unquestionably, if the people were
indulging in *figurative* murmurs that their bones were become dry, and
that their hope had perished—plaintive at the consequences of their
dispersion—then God might fairly enough seem to have consoled their
*figurative* despair with a *figurative* promise. Since, however, no
injury had as yet alighted on the people from their dispersion, although
the hope of the resurrection had very frequently failed amongst them, it
is manifest that it was owing to the perishing condition of their bodies
that their faith in the resurrection was shaken. God, therefore, was
rebuilding the faith which the people were pulling down. But even if it
were true that Israel was then depressed at some shock in their existing
circumstances, we must not on that account suppose that the purpose of
revelation could have rested in a parable: its aim must have been to
testify a resurrection, in order to raise the nation’s hope to even an
eternal salvation and an indispensable restoration, and thereby turn off
their minds from brooding over their present affairs.  This indeed is
the aim of other prophets likewise. “Ye shall go forth,” (says Malachi),
“from your sepulchres, as young calves let loose from their bonds, and
ye shall tread down your enemies.” <span
id="fr_7489"></span>[7490](#fn_7489) And again, (Isaiah says): “Your
heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall spring up like the
grass,” <span id="fr_7490"></span>[7491](#fn_7490) because the grass
also is renewed by the dissolution and corruption of the seed. In a
word, if it is contended that the figure of the rising bones refers
properly to the state of Israel, why is the same hope announced to all
nations, instead of being limited to Israel only, of reinvesting those
osseous remains with bodily substance and vital breath, and of raising
up their dead out of the grave? For the language is universal: “The dead
shall arise, and come forth from their graves; for the dew which cometh
from Thee is medicine to their bones.” <span
id="fr_7491"></span>[7492](#fn_7491) In another passage *it is written*:
“All flesh shall come to worship before me, saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_7492"></span>[7493](#fn_7492) When?  When the fashion of this
world shall begin to pass away. For He said before: “As the new heaven
and the new earth, which I make, remain before me, saith the Lord, so
shall your seed remain.” <span id="fr_7493"></span>[7494](#fn_7493) Then
also shall be fulfilled what is written afterwards: “And they shall go
forth” (namely, from their graves), “and shall see the carcases of those
who have transgressed: for their worm shall never die, nor shall their
fire be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh” <span
id="fr_7494"></span>[7495](#fn_7494) even to that which, being raised
again from the dead and brought out from the grave, shall adore the Lord
for this great grace.
