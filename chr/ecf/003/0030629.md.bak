<span id="v.viii.xlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVII.—St. Paul, All Through,
Promises Eternal Life to the Body.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xlvii-p2"></span>For that must be living after the
world, <span id="page_580">p. 580</span> <span
id="v.viii.xlvii-Page_580"></span>which, as the old man, he declares to
be “crucified with Christ,” <span id="fr_7601"></span>[7602](#fn_7601.md)
not as a bodily structure, but as moral behaviour. Besides, if we do not
understand it in this sense, it is not our bodily frame which has been
transfixed (at all events), nor has our flesh endured the cross of
Christ; but the sense is that which he has subjoined, “that the body of
sin might be made void,” <span id="fr_7602"></span>[7603](#fn_7602.md) by
an amendment of life, not by a destruction of the substance, as he goes
on to say, “that henceforth we should not serve sin;” <span
id="fr_7603"></span>[7604](#fn_7603.md) and that we should believe
ourselves to be “dead with Christ,” in such a manner as that “we shall
also live with Him.” <span id="fr_7604"></span>[7605](#fn_7604.md) On the
same principle he says: “Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead
indeed.” <span id="fr_7605"></span>[7606](#fn_7605.md) To what?  To the
flesh? No, but “unto sin.” <span id="fr_7606"></span>[7607](#fn_7606.md)
Accordingly as to the flesh they will be saved—“alive unto God in Christ
Jesus,” <span id="fr_7607"></span>[7608](#fn_7607.md) through the flesh of
course, to which they will not be dead; since it is “unto sin,” and not
to the flesh, that they are dead.  For he pursues the point still
further:  “Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye
should obey it, and that ye should yield your members as instruments of
unrighteousness unto sin: but yield ye yourselves unto God, as those
that are alive from the dead”—not simply alive, but as alive from the
dead—“and your members as instruments of righteousness.” <span
id="fr_7608"></span>[7609](#fn_7608.md) And again:  “As ye have yielded
your members servants of uncleanness, and of iniquity unto iniquity,
even so now yield your members servants of righteousness unto holiness;
for whilst ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
What fruit had ye then in those things of which ye are now ashamed? For
the end of those things is death. But now, being made free from sin, and
become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end
everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is
eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” <span
id="fr_7609"></span>[7610](#fn_7609.md) Thus throughout this series of
passages, whilst withdrawing our members from unrighteousness and sin,
and applying them to righteousness and holiness, and transferring the
same from the wages of death to the donative of eternal life, he
undoubtedly promises to the flesh the recompense of salvation. Now it
would not at all have been consistent that any rule of holiness and
righteousness should be especially enjoined for the flesh, if the reward
of such a discipline were not also within its reach; nor could even
baptism be properly ordered for the flesh, if by its regeneration a
course were not inaugurated tending to its restitution; the apostle
himself suggesting this idea: “Know ye not, that so many of us as are
baptized into Jesus Christ, are baptized into His death? We are
therefore buried with Him by baptism into death, that just as Christ was
raised up from the dead, even so we also should walk in newness of
life.” <span id="fr_7610"></span>[7611](#fn_7610.md) And that you may not
suppose that this is said merely of that life which we have to walk in
the newness of, through baptism, by faith, the apostle with superlative
forethought adds: “For if we have been planted together in the likeness
of Christ’s death, we shall be also in the likeness of His
resurrection.” <span id="fr_7611"></span>[7612](#fn_7611.md) By a figure we
die in our baptism, but in a reality we rise again in the flesh, even as
Christ did, “that, as sin has reigned in death, so also grace might
reign through righteousness unto life eternal, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.” <span id="fr_7612"></span>[7613](#fn_7612.md) But how so, unless
equally in the flesh? For where the death is, there too must be the life
after the death, because also the life was first there, where the death
subsequently was. Now, if the dominion of death operates only in the
dissolution of the flesh, in like manner death’s contrary, life, ought
to produce the contrary effect, even the restoration of the flesh; so
that, just as death had swallowed it up in its strength, it also, after
this mortal was swallowed up of immortality, may hear the challenge
pronounced against it: “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is
thy victory?” <span id="fr_7613"></span>[7614](#fn_7613.md) For in this way
“grace shall there much more abound, where sin once abounded.” <span
id="fr_7614"></span>[7615](#fn_7614.md) In this way also “shall strength be
made perfect in weakness,” <span id="fr_7615"></span>[7616](#fn_7615.md)
—saving what is lost, reviving what is dead, healing what is stricken,
curing what is faint, redeeming what is lost, freeing what is enslaved,
recalling what has strayed, raising what is fallen; and this from earth
to heaven, where, as the apostle teaches the Philippians, “we have our
citizenship, <span id="fr_7616"></span>[7617](#fn_7616.md) from whence also
we look for our Saviour Jesus Christ, who shall change our body of
humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body” <span
id="fr_7617"></span>[7618](#fn_7617.md) —of course after the resurrection,
because Christ Himself was not glorified before He suffered. These must
be “the bodies” which he “beseeches” the Romans <span id="page_581">p.
581</span> <span id="v.viii.xlvii-Page_581"></span>to “present” as “a
living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.” <span
id="fr_7618"></span>[7619](#fn_7618.md) But how a *living* sacrifice, if
these bodies are to perish?  How a *holy* one, if they are profanely
soiled? How *acceptable to God*, if they are condemned? Come, now, tell
me how that passage (in the Epistle) to the Thessalonians—which, because
of its clearness, I should suppose to have been written with a
sunbeam—is understood by our heretics, who shun the light of Scripture: 
“And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly.” And as if this were not
plain enough, it goes on to say: “And may your whole body, and soul, and
spirit be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_7619"></span>[7620](#fn_7619.md) Here you have the entire substance
of man destined to salvation, and *that* at no other time than at the
coming of the Lord, which is the key of the resurrection. <span
id="fr_7620"></span>[7621](#fn_7620.md)
