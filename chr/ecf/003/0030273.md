<span id="v.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Pagan Philosophy the Parent of
Heresies. The Connection Between Deflections from Christian Faith and
the Old Systems of Pagan Philosophy.</span>

<span id="v.iii.vii-p2"></span>These are “the doctrines” of men and “of
demons” <span id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910) produced for itching
ears of the spirit of this world’s wisdom: this the Lord called
“foolishness,” <span id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911) and “chose the
foolish things of the world” to confound even philosophy itself. For
(philosophy) it is which is the material of the world’s wisdom, the rash
interpreter of the nature and the dispensation of God. Indeed <span
id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912) heresies are themselves
instigated <span id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913) by philosophy.
From this source came the Æons, and I known not what infinite
forms, <span id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914) and the trinity of
man <span id="fr_1915"></span>[1916](#fn_1915) in the system of
Valentinus, who was of Plato’s school. From the same source came
Marcion’s better god, with all his tranquillity; he came of the Stoics.
Then, again, the opinion that the soul dies is held by the Epicureans;
while the denial of the restoration of the body is taken from the
aggregate school of all the philosophers; also, when matter is made
equal to God, then you have the teaching of Zeno; and when any doctrine
is alleged touching a god of fire, then Heraclitus comes in. The same
subject-matter is discussed over and over again <span
id="fr_1916"></span>[1917](#fn_1916) by the heretics and the
philosophers; the same arguments <span
id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917) are involved. Whence comes evil?
Why is it permitted? What is the origin of man? and in what way does he
come? Besides the question which Valentinus has very lately
proposed—Whence comes God? Which he settles with the answer: From *<span
class="c42"><span id="v.iii.vii-p10.1"></span>enthymesis</span>* and
*<span class="c42"><span
id="v.iii.vii-p10.2"></span>ectroma</span>*. <span
id="fr_1918"></span>[1919](#fn_1918) Unhappy Aristotle! who invented for
these men dialectics, the art of building up and pulling down; an art so
evasive in its propositions, <span id="fr_1919"></span>[1920](#fn_1919)
so far-fetched in its conjectures, so harsh, in its arguments, so
productive of contentions—embarrassing <span
id="fr_1920"></span>[1921](#fn_1920) even to itself, retracting
everything, and really treating of <span
id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921) nothing! Whence spring those
“fables and endless genealogies,” <span
id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922) and “unprofitable questions,” <span
id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923) and “words which spread like a
cancer?” <span id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924) From all these, when
the apostle would restrain us, he expressly names *philosophy* as that
which he would have us be on our guard against. Writing to the
Colossians, he says, “See that no one beguile you through philosophy and
vain deceit, after the tradition of men, and contrary to the wisdom of
the Holy Ghost.” <span id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925) He had been
at Athens, and had in his interviews (with its philosophers) become
acquainted with that human wisdom which pretends to know the truth,
whilst it only corrupts it, and is itself divided into its own manifold
heresies, by the variety of its mutually repugnant sects. What indeed
has Athens to do with Jerusalem? What concord is there between the
Academy and the Church? what between heretics and Christians? Our
instruction comes from “the porch of Solomon,” <span
id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926) who had himself taught that “the
Lord should be sought in simplicity of heart.” <span
id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927) Away with <span
id="fr_1928"></span>[1929](#fn_1928) all attempts to produce a mottled
Christianity of Stoic, Platonic, and dialectic composition! We want no
curious disputation after possessing Christ Jesus, no inquisition after
enjoying the gospel! With our faith, we desire no further belief. For
this is our palmary faith, that there is nothing which we ought to
believe besides.
