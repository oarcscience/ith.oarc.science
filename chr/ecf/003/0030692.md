<span id="v.x.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.x.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.</span>

<span id="v.x.xi-p2"></span>In the same manner, therefore, we maintain
that the other announcements too refer to the condition of martyrdom.
“He,” says Jesus, “who will value his own life also more than me, is not
worthy of me,” <span id="fr_8285"></span>[8286](#fn_8285.md) —that is, he
who will rather live by denying, than die by confessing, me; and “he who
findeth his life shall lose it; but he who loseth it for my sake shall
find it.” <span id="fr_8286"></span>[8287](#fn_8286.md) Therefore indeed he
finds it, who, in winning life, denies; but he who thinks that he wins
it by denying, will lose it in hell. On the other hand, he who, through
confessing, is killed, will lose it for the present, but is also about
to find it unto everlasting life. In fine, governors themselves, when
they urge men to deny, say, “Save your life;” and, “Do not lose your
life.” How would Christ speak, but in accordance with the treatment to
which the Christian would be subjected? But when He forbids thinking
about what answer to make at a judgment-seat, <span
id="fr_8287"></span>[8288](#fn_8287.md) He is preparing His own servants
*for what awaited them*, He gives the assurance that the Holy Spirit
will answer *by them*; and when He wishes a brother to be visited in
prison, <span id="fr_8288"></span>[8289](#fn_8288.md) He is commanding that
those about to confess be the object of solicitude; and He is soothing
their <span id="page_645">p. 645</span> <span
id="v.x.xi-Page_645"></span>sufferings when He asserts that God will
avenge His own elect. <span id="fr_8289"></span>[8290](#fn_8289.md) In the
parable also of the withering of the word <span
id="fr_8290"></span>[8291](#fn_8290.md) after the green blade had sprung
up, He is drawing a picture with reference to the burning heat of
persecutions. If these announcements are not understood as they are
made, without doubt they signify something else than the sound
indicates; and there will be one thing in the words, another in their
meanings, as is the case with allegories, with parables, with riddles.
Whatever wind of reasoning, therefore, these scorpions may catch (in
their sails), with whatever subtlety they may attack, there is now one
line of defence: <span id="fr_8291"></span>[8292](#fn_8291.md) an appeal
will be made to the facts themselves, whether they occur as the
Scriptures represent that they would; since another thing will then be
meant in the Scriptures if that very one (which seems to be so) is not
found in actual facts. For what is written, must needs come to pass.
Besides, what is written will then come to pass, if something different
does not.  But, lo! we are both regarded as persons to be hated by all
men for the sake of the name, as it is written; and are delivered up by
our nearest of kin also, as it is written; and are brought before
magistrates, and examined, and tortured, and make confession, and are
ruthlessly killed, as it is written. So the Lord ordained. If He
ordained these events otherwise, why do they not come to pass otherwise
than He ordained them, that is, as He ordained them? And yet they do not
come to pass otherwise than He ordained. Therefore, as they come to
pass, so He ordained; and as He ordained, so they come to pass. For
neither would they have been permitted to occur otherwise than He
ordained, nor for His part would He have ordained otherwise than He
would wish them to occur. Thus these passages of Scripture will not mean
ought else than we recognise in actual facts; or if those events are not
yet taking place which are announced, how are those taking place which
have not been announced? For these events which are taking place have
not been announced, if those which are announced are different, and not
these which are taking place. Well now, seeing the very occurrences are
met with in actual life which are believed to have been expressed with a
different meaning in words, what would happen if they were found to have
come to pass in a different manner *than had been revealed*? But this
will be the waywardness of faith, not to believe what has been
demonstrated, to assume the truth of what has not been demonstrated. And
to this waywardness I will offer the following objection also, that if
these events, which occur as is written, will not be the very ones which
are announced, those too (which are meant) ought not to occur as is
written, that they themselves also may not, after the example of these
*others*, be in danger of exclusion, since there is one thing in the
words and another in the facts; and there remains that even the events
which have been announced are not seen when they occur, if they are
announced otherwise than they have to occur. And how will those be
believed (to have come to pass), which will not have been announced as
they come to pass? Thus heretics, by not believing what is announced as
it has been shown to have taken place, believe what has not been even
announced.
