<span id="v.vi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The Adventures of Achamoth
Outside the Pleroma. The Mission of Christ in Pursuit of Her. Her
Longing for Christ. Horos’ Hostility to Her. Her Continued
Suffering.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xiv-p2"></span>For Enthymesis, or rather Achamoth—because
by this inexplicable <span id="fr_6765"></span>[6766](#fn_6765) name
alone must she be henceforth designated—when in company with the vicious
Passion, her inseparable companion, she was expelled to places devoid of
that light which is the substance of the Pleroma, even to the void and
empty region of Epicurus, she becomes wretched also because of the place
of her banishment. She is indeed without either form or feature, even an
untimely and abortive production. Whilst she is in this plight, <span
id="fr_6766"></span>[6767](#fn_6766) Christ descends from <span
id="fr_6767"></span>[6768](#fn_6767) the heights, conducted by Horos, in
order to impart form to the abortion, out of his own energies, the form
of substance only, but not of knowledge also. Still she is left with
some property. She has restored to her the odour of immortality, in
order that she might, under its influence, be overcome with the desire
of better things than belonged to her present plight. <span
id="fr_6768"></span>[6769](#fn_6768) Having accomplished His merciful
mission, not without the assistance of the Holy Spirit, Christ returns
to the Pleroma. It is usual out of an abundance of things <span
id="fr_6769"></span>[6770](#fn_6769) for names to be also forthcoming. 
Enthymesis came from action; <span id="fr_6770"></span>[6771](#fn_6770)
whence Achamoth came is still a question; Sophia emanates from the
Father, the Holy Spirit from an angel. She entertains a regret for
Christ immediately after she had discovered her desertion by him.
Therefore she hurried forth herself, in quest of the light of Him Whom
she did not at all discover, as He operated in an invisible manner; for
how else would she make search for His light, which was as unknown to
her as He was Himself? Try, however, she did, and perhaps would have
found Him, had not the self-same Horos, who had met her mother so
opportunely, fallen in with the daughter quite as unseasonably, so as to
exclaim at her <span class="sc"><span
id="v.vi.xiv-p8.1"></span>Iao</span>! just as we hear the cry “Porro
Quirites” (“Out of the way, Romans!”), or else Fidem Cæsaris!”  (“By the
faith of Cæsar!”), whence (as they will have it) the name <span
class="sc"><span id="v.vi.xiv-p8.3"></span>Iao</span> comes to be found
is the Scriptures. <span id="fr_6771"></span>[6772](#fn_6771) Being thus
hindered from proceeding further, and being unable to surmount <span
id="fr_6772"></span>[6773](#fn_6772) the Cross, that is to say, Horos,
because she had not yet practised herself in the part of Catullus’
*Laureolus*, <span id="fr_6773"></span>[6774](#fn_6773) *and* given
over, as it were, to that passion of hers in a manifold and complicated
mesh, she began to be afflicted with every impulse thereof, with
sorrow,—because she had not accomplished her enterprise, with fear,—lest
she should lose her life, even as she had lost the light, with
consternation, *and* then with ignorance. But not as her mother (did she
suffer this), for *she* was an Æon. Hers, however, was a worse
suffering, considering her condition; for another tide of emotion still
overwhelmed her, even of conversion to the Christ, by Whom she had been
restored to life, and had been directed <span
id="fr_6774"></span>[6775](#fn_6774) to this very conversion.

<span id="v.vi.xiv-p9"></span> It is not necessary, with Rigaltius, to
make a difficulty about this, when we remember that Tertullian only
refers to a silly conceit of the Valentinians touching the origin of the
sacred name.

<span id="v.vi.xiv-p10"></span> Or does “nec habens *supervolare*
crucem” mean “being unable to *elude* the cross?” As if Tertullian
meant, in his raillery, to say, that Achamoth had not the skill of the
player who played the part of Laureolus. Although so often suspended on
the gibbet, he had of course as often escaped the real penalty.
