<span id="v.v.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—The Assumption that There are Two
Earths Mentioned in the History of the Creation, Refuted.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxv-p2"></span>He accordingly maintains that there are two
earths set before us in the passage in question: one, which God made in
the beginning; the other being the Matter of which God made the world,
and concerning which it is said, “And the earth was without form, and
void.” <span id="fr_6359"></span>[6360](#fn_6359.md) Of course, if I were
to ask, to which of the two earths the name *earth* is best
suited, <span id="fr_6360"></span>[6361](#fn_6360.md) I shall be told that
the earth which was made derived the appellation from that of which it
was made, on the ground that it is more likely that the offspring should
get its name from the original, than the original from the offspring.
This being the case, another question presents itself to us, whether it
is right and proper that this earth which God made should have derived
its name from that out of which He made it? For I find from Hermogenes
and the rest of the *Materialist* heretics, <span
id="fr_6361"></span>[6362](#fn_6361.md) that while the one earth was indeed
“without form, and void,” this one of ours obtained from God in an equal
degree <span id="fr_6362"></span>[6363](#fn_6362.md) both form, and beauty,
and symmetry; and therefore that the earth which was created was a
different thing from that out of which it was created. Now, having
become a different thing, it could not possibly have shared with the
other in its name, after it had declined from its condition. If *earth*
was the proper name of the (original) Matter, this world of ours, which
is not Matter, because it has become another thing, is unfit to bear the
name of earth, seeing that that name belongs to something else, and is a
stranger to its nature. But (you will tell me) Matter which has
undergone creation, that is, our earth, had with its original a
community of name no less than of kind. By no means. For although the
pitcher is formed out of the clay, I shall no longer call it clay, but a
pitcher; so likewise, although *electrum* <span
id="fr_6363"></span>[6364](#fn_6363.md) is compounded of gold and silver, I
shall yet not call it either gold or silver, but *electrum*. When there
is a departure from the nature of any thing, there is likewise a
relinquishment of its name—with a propriety which is alike demanded by
the designation and the condition. How great a change indeed from the
condition of that earth, which is Matter, has come over this earth of
ours, is plain even from the fact that the latter has received this
testimony to its goodness in Genesis, “And God saw that it was
good;” <span id="fr_6364"></span>[6365](#fn_6364.md) while the former,
according to Hermogenes, is regarded as the origin and cause of all
evils. Lastly, if the one is Earth because the other is, why also is the
one not Matter as the other is? Indeed, by this rule both the heaven and
all creatures ought to have had the names of *Earth* and *Matter*, since
they all consist of Matter. I have said enough touching the designation
Earth, by which he will have it that Matter is understood. This, as
everybody knows, is the name of one of the elements; for so we are
taught by nature first, and afterwards by Scripture, except it be that
credence must be given to that Silenus who talked so confidently in the
presence of king Midas of another world, according to the account of
Theopompus. But the same author informs us that there are also several
gods.
