<span id="iv.v.xxix-p2"></span>Even as things are, if your thought is to
spend this period of existence in enjoyments, how are you so ungrateful
as to reckon insufficient, as not thankfully to recognize the many and
exquisite pleasures God has bestowed upon you? For what more delightful
<span id="page_91">p. 91</span> <span id="iv.v.xxix-Page_91"></span>than
to have God the Father and our Lord at peace with us, than revelation of
the truth than confession of our errors, than pardon of the innumerable
sins of our past life? What greater pleasure than distaste of pleasure
itself, contempt of all that the world can give, true liberty, a pure
conscience, a contented life, and freedom from all fear of death? What
nobler than to tread under foot the gods of the nations—to exorcise evil
spirits <span id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md) —to perform cures—to
seek divine revealings—to live to God? These are the pleasures, these
the spectacles that befit Christian men—holy, everlasting, free. Count
of these as your circus games, fix your eyes on the courses of the
world, the gliding seasons, reckon up the periods of time, long for the
goal of the final consummation, defend the societies of the churches, be
startled at God’s signal, be roused up at the angel’s trump, glory in
the palms of martyrdom. If the literature of the stage delight you, we
have literature in abundance of our own—plenty of verses, sentences,
songs, proverbs; and these not fabulous, but true; not tricks of art,
but plain realities.  Would you have also fightings and wrestlings?
Well, of these there is no lacking, and they are not of slight account.
Behold unchastity overcome by chastity, perfidy slain by faithfulness,
cruelty stricken by compassion, impudence thrown into the shade by
modesty: these are the contests we have among us, and in these *we* win
our crowns. Would you have something of blood too? You have Christ’s.
