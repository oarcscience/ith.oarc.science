Their Strength Derived from Weakness of Men's Faith. They Have Not the
Truth. Simile of Pugilists and Gladiators in Illustration.](0030268)  
[Weak People Fall an Easy Prey to Heresy, Which Derives Strength from
the General Frailty of Mankind.  Eminent Men Have Fallen from Faith;
Saul, David, Solomon. The Constancy of Christ.](0030269)

Adduced. These Imply the Possibility of Falling into Heresy.](0030270)  
[Heresy, as Well as Schism and Dissension, Disapproved by St. Paul, Who

God, Salutary Trials for Training and Approving the Faith of
Christians.](0030271)

Deflections from Christian Faith and the Old Systems of Pagan
Philosophy.](0030273)

Were Taught by God Through Christ. All Opinion Which Has No Such Divine
Origin and Apostolic Tradition to Show, is Ipso Facto False.](0030287)

[Book I](0030314)  
[Chapter I](0030315)  
[Marcion, Aided by Cerdon, Teaches a Duality of Gods; How He Constructed
This Heresy of an Evil and a Good God.](0030316)  
[The Unity of God.  He is the Supreme Being, and There Cannot Be a
Second Supreme.](0030317)  
[Defence of the Divine Unity Against Objection. No Analogy Between Human
Powers and God's Sovereignty. The Objection Otherwise Untenable, for Why
Stop at Two Gods?](0030318)  
[The Dual Principle Falls to the Ground; Plurality of Gods, of Whatever
Number, More Consistent. Absurdity and Injury to Piety Resulting from
Marcion's Duality.](0030319)  
[Marcion Untrue to His Theory. He Pretends that His Gods are Equal, But
He Really Makes Them Diverse. Then, Allowing Their Divinity, Denies This
Diversity.](0030320)  
[Other Beings Besides God are in Scripture Called God. This Objection
Frivolous, for It is Not a Question of Names. The Divine Essence is the
Thing at Issue. Heresy, in Its General Terms, Thus Far
Treated.](0030321)  
[Specific Points.  The Novelty of Marcion's God Fatal to His
Pretensions. God is from Everlasting, He Cannot Be in Any Wise
New.](0030322)  
[Marcion's Gnostic Pretensions Vain, for the True God is Neither Unknown
Nor Uncertain. The Creator, Whom He Owns to Be God, Alone Supplies an
Induction, by Which to Judge of the True God.](0030323)  
[The Creator Was Known as the True God from the First by His Creation.
Acknowledged by the Soul and Conscience of Man Before He Was Revealed by
Moses.](0030324)  
[The Evidence for God External to Him; But the External Creation Which
Yields This Evidence is Really Not Extraneous, for All Things are God's.
Marcion's God, Having Nothing to Show for Himself, No God at All.
Marcion's Scheme Absurdly Defective, Not Furnishing Evidence for His New
God's Existence, Which Should at Least Be Able to Compete with the Full
Evidence of the Creator.](0030325)  
[Impossibility of Acknowledging God Without This External Evidence Of
His Existence. Marcion's Rejection of Such Evidence for His God Savours
of Impudence and Malignity.](0030326)  
[The Marcionites Depreciate the Creation, Which, However, is a Worthy
Witness of God. This Worthiness Illustrated by References to the Heathen
Philosophers, Who Were Apt to Invest the Several Parts of Creation with
Divine Attributes.](0030327)  
[All Portions of Creation Attest the Excellence of the Creator, Whom
Marcion Vilifies. His Inconsistency Herein Exposed. Marcion's Own God
Did Not Hesitate to Use the Creator's Works in Instituting His Own
Religion.](0030328)  
[The Lateness of the Revelation of Marcion's God. The Question of the
Place Occupied by the Rival Deities. Instead of Two Gods, Marcion Really
(Although, as It Would Seem, Unconsciously) Had Nine Gods in His
System.](0030329)  
[Marcion Assumes the Existence of Two Gods from the Antithesis Between
Things Visible and Things Invisible. This Antithetical Principle in Fact
Characteristic of the Works of the Creator, the One God--Maker of All
Things Visible and Invisible.](0030330)  
[Not Enough, as the Marcionites Pretend, that the Supreme God Should
Rescue Man; He Must Also Have Created Him. The Existence of God Proved
by His Creation, a Prior Consideration to His Character.](0030331)

Vouchers Both of Created Evidence and of Adequate
Revelation.](0030332)  
[Jesus Christ, the Revealer of the Creator, Could Not Be the Same as
Marcion's God, Who Was Only Made Known by the Heretic Some CXV. Years

Gospels.](0030333)  
[Marcion, Justifying His Antithesis Between the Law and the Gospel by
the Contention of St. Paul with St. Peter, Shown to Have Mistaken St.

Paul's Teaching, Which Agrees Wholly with the Creator's
Decrees.](0030334)  
[St. Paul Preached No New God, When He Announced the Repeal of Some of

Creator, as the God Whom Christ Revealed, Until Marcion's
Heresy.](0030335)

Found Wanting Herein. It Came Not to Man's Rescue When First
Wanted.](0030336)

Defective Here Also; His Goodness Irrational and Misapplied.](0030337)  
[The Goodness of Marcion's God Only Imperfectly Manifested; It Saves But
Few, and the Souls Merely of These. Marcion's Contempt of the Body
Absurd.](0030338)  
[God is Not a Being of Simple Goodness; Other Attributes Belong to Him.
Marcion Shows Inconsistency in the Portraiture of His Simply Good and
Emotionless God.](0030339)

Ungodlike. He Dislikes Evil, But Does Not Punish Its
Perpetration.](0030340)  
[Dangerous Effects to Religion and Morality of the Doctrine of So Weak a
God.](0030341)

Choice.](0030349)

[Man, Endued with Liberty, Superior to the Angels, Overcomes Even the
Angel Which Lured Him to His Fall, When Repentant and Resuming Obedience
to God.](0030352)  
[Another Cavil Answered, I.e., the Fall Imputable to God, Because Man's
Soul is a Portion of the Spiritual Essence of the Creator. The Divine
Afflatus Not in Fault in the Sin of Man, But the Human Will Which Was
Additional to It.](0030353)  
[Another Cavil Met, I.e., the Devil Who Instigated Man to Sin Himself
the Creature of God. Nay, the Primeval Cherub Only Was God's Work.  The
Devilish Nature Superadded by Wilfulness. In Man's Recovery the Devil is
Vanquished in a Conflict on His Own Ground.](0030354)

Judgment, This Was Compatible with His Goodness, and Enhances the True
