[Marcion Untrue to His Theory. He Pretends that His Gods are Equal, But
He Really Makes Them Diverse. Then, Allowing Their Divinity, Denies This
Diversity.](0030320.md)  
[Other Beings Besides God are in Scripture Called God. This Objection
Frivolous, for It is Not a Question of Names. The Divine Essence is the
Thing at Issue. Heresy, in Its General Terms, Thus Far
Treated.](0030321.md)  
[Specific Points.  The Novelty of Marcion's God Fatal to His
Pretensions. God is from Everlasting, He Cannot Be in Any Wise
New.](0030322.md)  
[Marcion's Gnostic Pretensions Vain, for the True God is Neither Unknown
Nor Uncertain. The Creator, Whom He Owns to Be God, Alone Supplies an
Induction, by Which to Judge of the True God.](0030323.md)

Yields This Evidence is Really Not Extraneous, for All Things are God's.

God's Existence, Which Should at Least Be Able to Compete with the Full
Evidence of the Creator.](0030325.md)
