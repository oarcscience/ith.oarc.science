<span id="v.iv.iii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—The Oath of God: Its
Meaning. Moses, When Deprecating God’s Wrath Against Israel, a Type of
Christ.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xxvi-p2"></span>But God also swears. Well, is it, I
wonder, by the God of Marcion? No, no, he says; a much vainer oath—by
Himself! <span id="fr_3034"></span>[3035](#fn_3034.md) What was He to do,
when He knew <span id="fr_3035"></span>[3036](#fn_3035.md) of no other God;
especially when He was swearing to this very point, that besides himself
there was absolutely no God?  Is it then of swearing falsely that you
convict <span id="fr_3036"></span>[3037](#fn_3036.md) Him, or of swearing a
vain oath? But it is not possible for him to appear to have sworn
falsely, when he was ignorant, as you say he was, that there was another
God.  For when he swore by that which he knew, he really committed no
perjury. But it was not a vain oath for him to swear that there was no
other God.  It would indeed be a vain oath, if there had been no persons
who believed that there were other Gods, like the worshippers of idols
then, and the heretics of the present day.  Therefore He swears by
Himself, in order that you may believe God, even when He swears that
there <span id="page_318">p. 318</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.xxvi-Page_318"></span>is besides Himself no other God at
all. But you have yourself, O Marcion, compelled God to do this. For
even so early as then were you foreseen. Hence, if He swears both in His
promises and His threatenings, and thus extorts <span
id="fr_3037"></span>[3038](#fn_3037.md) faith which at first was difficult,
nothing is unworthy of God which causes men to believe in God. But (you
say) God was even then mean <span id="fr_3038"></span>[3039](#fn_3038.md)
enough in His very fierceness, when, in His wrath against the people for
their consecration of the calf, He makes this request of His servant
Moses: “Let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I
may consume them; and I will make of thee a great nation.” <span
id="fr_3039"></span>[3040](#fn_3039.md) Accordingly, you maintain that
Moses is better than his God, as the deprecator, nay the averter, of His
anger. “For,” said he, “Thou shalt not do this; or else destroy me along
with them.” <span id="fr_3040"></span>[3041](#fn_3040.md) Pitiable are ye
also, as well as the people, since you know not Christ, prefigured in
the person of Moses as the deprecator of the Father, and the offerer of
His own life for the salvation of the people. It is enough, however,
that the nation was at the instant really given to Moses. That which he,
as a servant, was able to ask of the Lord, the Lord required of Himself.
For this purpose did He say to His servant, “Let me alone, that I may
consume them,” in order that by his entreaty, and by offering himself,
he might hinder <span id="fr_3041"></span>[3042](#fn_3041.md) (the
threatened judgment), and that you might by such an instance learn how
much privilege is vouchsafed <span id="fr_3042"></span>[3043](#fn_3042.md)
with God to a faithful man and a prophet.
