<span id="v.viii.l-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter L.—In What Sense Flesh and Blood are
Excluded from the Kingdom of God.</span>

<span id="v.viii.l-p2"></span>Putting aside, however, all
interpretations of this sort, which criminate the works of the flesh and
blood, it may be permitted me to claim for the resurrection these very
substances, understood in none other than their natural sense. For it is
not the resurrection that is directly denied to flesh and blood, but the
kingdom of God, which is incidental to <span
id="fr_7650"></span>[7651](#fn_7650) the resurrection (for there is a
resurrection of judgment <span id="fr_7651"></span>[7652](#fn_7651)
also); and there is even a confirmation of the general resurrection of
the flesh, whenever a special one is excepted.  Now, when it is clearly
stated what the condition is to which the resurrection does not lead, it
is understood what that is to which it does lead; and, therefore, whilst
it is in consideration of *men’s* merits that a difference is made in
their resurrection by their conduct in the flesh, and not by the
substance thereof, it is evident even from this, that flesh and blood
are excluded from the kingdom of God in respect of their sin, not of
their substance; and although in respect of their natural
condition <span id="fr_7652"></span>[7653](#fn_7652) they will rise
again for the judgment, because they rise not for the kingdom. Again, I
will say, “Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God;” <span
id="fr_7653"></span>[7654](#fn_7653) and justly (does the apostle
declare this of them, considered) alone and in themselves, in order to
show that the Spirit is still needed (to qualify them) for the
kingdom. <span id="fr_7654"></span>[7655](#fn_7654) For it is “the
Spirit that quickeneth” *us* for the kingdom of God; “the flesh
profiteth nothing.” <span id="fr_7655"></span>[7656](#fn_7655) There is,
however, something else which can be profitable thereunto, that is, the
Spirit; and through the Spirit, the works also of the Spirit. Flesh and
blood, therefore, must in every case rise again, equally, in their
proper quality. But they to whom it is granted to enter the kingdom of
God, will have to put on the power of an incorruptible and immortal
life; for without this, *or* before they are able to obtain it, they
cannot enter into the kingdom of God. With good reason, then, flesh and
blood, as we have already said, by themselves fail to <span
id="page_584">p. 584</span> <span id="v.viii.l-Page_584"></span>obtain
the kingdom of God. But inasmuch as “this corruptible (that is, the
flesh) must put on incorruption, and this mortal (that is, the blood)
must put on immortality,” <span id="fr_7656"></span>[7657](#fn_7656) by
the change which is to follow the resurrection, it will, for the best of
reasons, happen that flesh and blood, after that change and
investiture, <span id="fr_7657"></span>[7658](#fn_7657) will become able
to inherit the kingdom of God—but not without the resurrection. Some
will have it, that by the phrase “flesh and blood,” because of its rite
of circumcision, Judaism is meant, which is itself too alienated from
the kingdom of God, as being accounted “the old or former conversation,”
and as being designated by this title in another passage of the apostle
also, who, “when it pleased God to reveal to him His Son, to preach Him
amongst the heathen, immediately conferred not with flesh and blood,” as
he writes to the Galatians, <span id="fr_7658"></span>[7659](#fn_7658)
(meaning by the phrase) the circumcision, that is to say, Judaism.
