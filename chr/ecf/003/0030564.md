<span id="v.vii.ix-p1"></span> <span id="page_530">p. 530</span> <span
id="v.vii.ix-Page_530"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Christ’s Flesh Perfectly Natural,
Like Our Own. None of the Supernatural Features Which the Heretics
Ascribed to It Discoverable, on a Careful View.</span>

<span id="v.vii.ix-p2"></span>We have thus far gone on the principle,
that nothing which is derived from some other thing, however different
it may be from that from which it is derived, is so different as not to
suggest the source from which it comes.  No material substance is
without the witness of its own original, however great a change into new
properties it may have undergone. There is this very body of ours, the
formation of which out of the dust of the ground is a truth which has
found its way into Gentile fables; it certainly testifies its own origin
from the two elements of earth and water,—from the former by its flesh,
from the latter by its blood. Now, although there is a difference in the
appearance of qualities (in other words, that which proceeds from
something else is in development <span
id="fr_7067"></span>[7068](#fn_7067) different.md), yet, after all, what is
blood but red fluid? what is flesh but earth in an especial <span
id="fr_7068"></span>[7069](#fn_7068.md) form? Consider the respective
qualities,—of the muscles as clods; of the bones as stones; the
mammillary glands as a kind of pebbles. Look upon the close junctions of
the nerves as propagations of roots, and the branching courses of the
veins as winding rivulets, and the down (which covers us) as moss, and
the hair as grass, and the very treasures of marrow within our bones as
ores <span id="fr_7069"></span>[7070](#fn_7069.md) of flesh. All these
marks of the earthy origin were in Christ; and it is they which obscured
Him as the Son of God, for He was looked on as man, for no other reason
whatever than because He existed in the corporeal substance of a man. Or
else, show us some celestial substance in Him purloined from the Bear,
and the Pleiades, and the Hyades. Well, then, *the characteristics*
which we have enumerated are so many proofs that His was an earthy
flesh, as ours is; but anything new or anything strange I do not
discover. Indeed it was from His words and actions only, from His
teaching and miracles solely, that men, though amazed, owned Christ to
be man. <span id="fr_7070"></span>[7071](#fn_7070.md) But if there had been
in Him any new kind of flesh miraculously obtained (from the stars), it
would have been certainly well known. <span
id="fr_7071"></span>[7072](#fn_7071.md) As the case stood, however, it was
actually the ordinary <span id="fr_7072"></span>[7073](#fn_7072.md)
condition of His terrene flesh which made all things else about Him
wonderful, as when they said, “Whence hath this man this wisdom and
these mighty works?” <span id="fr_7073"></span>[7074](#fn_7073.md) Thus
spake even they who despised His outward form. His body did not reach
even to human beauty, to say nothing of heavenly glory. <span
id="fr_7074"></span>[7075](#fn_7074.md) Had the prophets given us no
information whatever concerning His ignoble appearance, His very
sufferings and the very contumely He endured bespeak it all. The
sufferings attested His human flesh, the contumely proved its abject
condition. Would any man have dared to touch even with his little
finger, the body *of Christ*, if it had been of an unusual nature; <span
id="fr_7075"></span>[7076](#fn_7075.md) or to smear His face with spitting,
if it had not invited it <span id="fr_7076"></span>[7077](#fn_7076.md) (by
its abjectness)? Why talk of a heavenly flesh, when you have no grounds
to offer us for your celestial theory? <span
id="fr_7077"></span>[7078](#fn_7077.md) Why deny it to be earthy, when you
have the best of reasons for knowing it to be earthy?  He hungered under
the devil’s *temptation*; He thirsted with the woman of Samaria; He wept
over Lazarus; He trembles at death (for “the flesh,” as He says, “is
weak” <span id="fr_7078"></span>[7079](#fn_7078) .md); at last, He pours
out His blood. These, I suppose, are celestial marks? But how, I ask,
could He have incurred contempt and suffering in the way I have
described, if there had beamed forth in that flesh of His aught of
celestial excellence? From this, therefore, we have a convincing proof
that in it there was nothing of heaven, because it must be capable of
contempt and suffering.
