<span id="v.iii.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIII.—Loose Company Preferred by
Heretics. Ungodliness the Effect of Their Teaching the Very Opposite of
Catholic Truth, Which Promotes the Fear of God, Both in Religious
Ordinances and Practical Life.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xliii-p2"></span>It has also been a subject of remark,
how extremely frequent is the intercourse which heretics hold with
magicians, with mountebanks, with astrologers, with philosophers; and
the reason is, <span id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292.md) that they are
men who devote themselves to curious questions. “Seek, and ye shall
find,” is everywhere in their minds. Thus, from the very nature of their
conduct, may be estimated the quality of their faith. In their
discipline we have an index of their doctrine. They say that God is not
to be feared; therefore all things are in their view free and unchecked.
Where, however is God not feared, except where He *is* not? Where God is
not, there truth also is not. Where there is no truth, then, naturally
enough, there is also such a discipline as theirs. But where God is,
there exists “the fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom.” <span
id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293.md) Where the fear of God is, there is
seriousness, an honourable and yet thoughtful <span
id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294.md) diligence, as well as an anxious
carefulness and a well-considered admission (to the sacred
ministry) <span id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295.md) and a
safely-guarded <span id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296.md) communion, and
promotion after good service, and a scrupulous submission (to
authority), and a devout attendance, <span
id="fr_2297"></span>[2298](#fn_2297.md) and a modest gait, and a united
church, and God *in* all things.
