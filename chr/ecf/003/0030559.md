id="v.vii.iv-Page_524"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—God’s Honour in the Incarnation of
His Son Vindicated.  Marcion’s Disparagement of Human Flesh Inconsistent
as Well as Impious. Christ Has Cleansed the Flesh. The Foolishness of
God is Most Wise.</span>

<span id="v.vii.iv-p2"></span>Since, therefore, you do not reject the
assumption of a body <span id="fr_6985"></span>[6986](#fn_6985) as
impossible or as hazardous to the character of God, it remains for you
to repudiate and censure it as unworthy of Him.  Come now, beginning
from the nativity itself, declaim <span
id="fr_6986"></span>[6987](#fn_6986) against the uncleanness of the
generative elements within the womb, the filthy concretion of fluid and
blood, of the growth of the flesh for nine months long out of that very
mire. Describe the womb as it enlarges <span
id="fr_6987"></span>[6988](#fn_6987) from day to day, heavy,
troublesome, restless even in sleep, changeful in its feelings of
dislike and desire. Inveigh now likewise against the shame itself of a
woman in travail <span id="fr_6988"></span>[6989](#fn_6988) which,
however, ought rather to be honoured in consideration of that peril, or
to be held sacred <span id="fr_6989"></span>[6990](#fn_6989) in respect
of (the mystery of) nature.  Of course you are horrified also at the
infant, which is shed into life with the embarrassments which accompany
it from the womb; <span id="fr_6990"></span>[6991](#fn_6990) you
likewise, of course, loathe it even after it is washed, when it is
dressed out in its swaddling-clothes, graced with repeated
anointing, <span id="fr_6991"></span>[6992](#fn_6991) smiled on with
nurse’s fawns. This reverend course of nature, <span
id="fr_6992"></span>[6993](#fn_6992) you, O Marcion, (are pleased to)
spit upon; and yet, in what way were you born? You detest a human being
at his birth; then after what fashion do you love anybody? Yourself, of
course, you had no love of, when you departed from the Church and the
faith of Christ. But never mind, <span
id="fr_6993"></span>[6994](#fn_6993) if you are not on good terms with
yourself, or even if you were born in a way different from other people.
Christ, at any rate, has loved even that man who was condensed in his
mother’s womb amidst all its uncleannesses, even that man who was
brought into life out of the said womb, even that man who was nursed
amidst the nurse’s simpers. <span id="fr_6994"></span>[6995](#fn_6994)
For his sake He came down (from heaven), for his sake He preached, for
his sake “He humbled Himself even unto death—the death of the
cross.” <span id="fr_6995"></span>[6996](#fn_6995) He loved, of course,
the being whom He redeemed at so great a cost. If Christ is the
Creator’s *Son*, it was with justice that He loved His own (creature);
if He comes from another god, His love was excessive, since He redeemed
a being who belonged to another. Well, then, loving man He loved his
nativity also, and his flesh as well. Nothing can be loved apart from
that through which whatever exists has its existence. Either take away
nativity, and then show us *your* man; or else withdraw the flesh, and
then present to our view the being whom God has redeemed—since it is
these very conditions <span id="fr_6996"></span>[6997](#fn_6996) which
constitute the man whom God has redeemed.  And are *you* for turning
these conditions into occasions of blushing to the very creature whom He
has redeemed, (censuring them), too, as unworthy of Him who certainly
would not have redeemed them had He not loved them?  Our birth He
reforms from death by a second birth from heaven; <span
id="fr_6997"></span>[6998](#fn_6997) our flesh He restores from every
harassing malady; when leprous, He cleanses it of the stain; when blind,
He rekindles its light; when palsied, He renews its strength; when
possessed with devils, He exorcises it; when dead, He reanimates
it,—then shall *we* blush to own it? If, to be sure, <span
id="fr_6998"></span>[6999](#fn_6998) He had chosen to be born of a mere
animal, and were to preach the kingdom of heaven invested with the body
of a beast either wild or tame, your censure (I imagine) would have
instantly met Him with this demurrer: “This is disgraceful for God, and
this is unworthy of the Son of God, and simply foolish.” For no other
reason than because one thus judges. It *is* of course foolish, if we
are to judge God by our own conceptions. But, Marcion, consider well
this Scripture, if indeed you have not erased it: “God hath chosen the
foolish things of the world, to confound the wise.” <span
id="fr_6999"></span>[7000](#fn_6999) Now what are those foolish things?
Are they the conversion of men to the worship of the true God, the
rejection of error, the whole training in righteousness, chastity,
mercy, patience, and innocence?  These things certainly are not
“foolish.” Inquire again, then, of what things he spoke, and when you
imagine that you have discovered what they are will you find anything to
be so “foolish” as believing in a God that has been born, and that of a
virgin, and of a fleshly nature too, who wallowed in all the
before-mentioned humiliations of nature?  But some one may say, <span
id="page_525">p. 525</span> <span id="v.vii.iv-Page_525"></span>“These
are not the foolish things; they must be other things which God has
chosen to confound the wisdom of the world.” And yet, according to the
world’s wisdom, it is more easy to believe that Jupiter became a bull or
a swan, if we listen to Marcion, than that Christ really became a man.
