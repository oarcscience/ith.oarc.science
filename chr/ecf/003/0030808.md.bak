<span id="vi.vii.xvii-p4"></span>(Unless patience sit by his side, cap.
i. p. 707.)

<span id="vi.vii.xvii-p5"></span>Let me quote words which, many years
ago, struck me forcibly, and which I trust, have been blest to my soul;
for which reason, I must be allowed, here, to thank their author, the
learned and fearless Dean Burgon, of Chichester. In his invaluable
*Commentary* on the Gospel, which while it abounds in the fruits of a
varied erudition, aims only to be practically useful, this pious scholar
remarks: “To Faith must be added *Patience*, the ‘patient waiting for
God,’ if we would escape the snare which Satan spread, no less for the
Holy One (*i.e.* in the Temp. upon the Pinnacle) than for the Israelites
at Massah. And this is perhaps the reason *of the remarkable prominence*
given to the grace of *Patience*, both by our Lord and His Apostles; a
circumstance, as it may be thought, *which has not altogether attracted
the* <span id="page_718">p. 718</span> <span
id="vi.vii.xvii-Page_718"></span>*attention which it deserves*.” He then
cites examples; <span id="fr_9184"></span>[9185](#fn_9184.md) but a
reference to any good concordance will strikingly exemplify the
admirable comment of this “godly and well-learned man.”  See his
comments on [Matt. 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007.md), [Luke
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.vii.xvii-p6.1"></span>.

<span id="vi.vii.xvii-p7"></span><span class="c6"><span

<span id="vi.vii.xvii-p8"></span>(Under their chin, cap. iv. p. 709.)

<span id="vi.vii.xvii-p9"></span>The reference in the note to Paris, as
represented by Virgil and in ancient sculpture, seems somewhat to the
point:

<span id="vi.vii.xvii-p10"></span>“Et nunc ille Paris, cum semiviro
comitatu.

<span id="vi.vii.xvii-p11"></span>Mæonia mentum mitra crinemq, madentem,

<span id="vi.vii.xvii-p12"></span>*Subnixus*, etc.”

<span id="vi.vii.xvii-p13"></span>He had just spoken of the *pileus* as
a “Cap of freedom,” but there was another form of *pileus* which was
just the reverse and was probably tied by *fimbriæ*, under the chin,
denoting a low order of slaves, effeminate men, perhaps *spadones*. Now,
the Phrygian bonnet to which Virgil refers, is introduced by him to
complete the reproach of his contemptuous expression (semiviro comitatu)
just before.  So, our author—“not only from men, *i.e.* men so degraded
as to wear this badge of extreme servitude, but even from cattle, etc.
Shall these mean creatures outdo us in obedience and patience?”

<span id="vi.vii.xvii-p14"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="vi.vii.xvii-p14.1"></span>III.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.xvii-p15"></span>(The world’s misusage, cap. xiii. p.
716.)

<span id="vi.vii.xvii-p16"></span>The Reverend Clergy who may read this
note will forgive a brother, who begins to be in respect of years, like
“Paul the aged,” for remarking, that the reading of the *Ante-Nicene
Fathers* often leads him to sigh—“Such were they from whom we have
received all that makes life tolerable, but how intolerable it was for
them: *are we, indeed, such as they would have considered Christians*?”
<span class="sc"><span id="vi.vii.xvii-p16.2"></span>God</span> be
praised for His mercy and forbearance in our days; but, still it is true
that “we have need of patience.” Is not much of all that we regard as
“the world’s misusage,” the gracious hand of the Master upon us, giving
us something for the exercise of that Patience, by which He forms us
into His own image? ([Heb. xii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.vii.xvii-p16.3"></span>.) Impatience of obscurity, of poverty, of
ingratitude, of misrepresentation, of “the slings and arrows” of slander
and abuse, is a revolt against that indispensable discipline of the
Gospel which requires us to “endure afflictions” in some form or other.
Who can complain when one thinks what it would have cost us to be
Christians in Tertullian’s time? The ambition of the Clergy is always
rebellion against God, and “patient waiting” is its only remedy. One
will find profitable reading on this subject in Massillon, <span
id="fr_9185"></span>[9186](#fn_9185.md) *<span
id="vi.vii.xvii-p17.1"></span>de l’Ambition des Clercs*<span
id="vi.vii.xvii-p17.2"></span>: “<span
id="vi.vii.xvii-p17.3"></span>Reposez-vous sur le Seigneur du soin de
votre destinée: il saura bien accomplir, tout seul, les desseins qu’il a
sur vous. Si votre élévation est son bon plaisir, elle sera, aussi son
ouvrage. Rendez-vous en digne seulement par la retraite, par la frayeur,
par la fuite, par les sentiments vifs de votre indignité…c’est ainsi que
les Chrysostome, les Grégoire, les Basil, les Augustin, furent donnés à
l’Église.”
