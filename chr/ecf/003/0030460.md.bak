<span id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The Divine Power Shown in
Christ’s Incarnation. Meaning of St. Paul’s Phrase. Likeness of Sinful
Flesh. No Docetism in It. Resurrection of Our Real Bodies. A Wide Chasm
Made in the Epistle by Marcion’s Erasure. When the Jews are Upbraided by
the Apostle for Their Misconduct to God; Inasmuch as that God Was the
Creator, a Proof is in Fact Given that St. Paul’s God Was the Creator.
The Precepts at the End of the Epistle, Which Marcion Allowed, Shown to
Be in Exact Accordance with the Creator’s Scriptures.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p2"></span>If the Father “sent His Son in the
likeness of sinful flesh,” <span id="fr_5836"></span>[5837](#fn_5836.md) it
must not therefore be said that the flesh which He seemed to have was
but a phantom. For he in a previous verse ascribed sin to the flesh, and
made it out to be “the law of sin dwelling in his members,” and “warring
against the law of the mind.” <span id="fr_5837"></span>[5838](#fn_5837.md)
On this account, therefore, (does he mean to say that) the Son was sent
in the likeness of sinful flesh, that He might redeem this sinful flesh
by a like substance, even a fleshly one, which bare a resemblance to
sinful flesh, although it was itself free from sin. Now this will be the
very perfection of divine power to effect the salvation (of man) in a
nature like his own. <span id="fr_5838"></span>[5839](#fn_5838.md) For it
would be no great matter if the Spirit of God remedied the flesh; but
when a flesh, which is the very copy <span
id="fr_5839"></span>[5840](#fn_5839.md) of the sinning substance—itself
flesh also—only without sin, (effects the remedy, then doubtless it is a
great thing).  The *likeness*, therefore, will have reference to the
quality <span id="fr_5840"></span>[5841](#fn_5840.md) of the sinfulness,
and not to any falsity <span id="fr_5841"></span>[5842](#fn_5841.md) of the
substance. Because he would not have added the attribute “sinful,” <span
id="fr_5842"></span>[5843](#fn_5842.md) if he meant the “likeness” to be so
predicated of the substance as to deny the verity thereof; in that case
he would only have used the word “flesh,” and omitted the “sinful.” But
inasmuch as he has put the two together, and said “sinful flesh,” (or
“flesh of sin,”) <span id="fr_5843"></span>[5844](#fn_5843.md) he has both
affirmed the substance, that is, the flesh and referred the *likeness*
to the fault of the substance, that is, to its sin. But even
suppose <span id="fr_5844"></span>[5845](#fn_5844.md) that the likeness was
predicated of the substance, the truth of the said substance will not be
thereby denied.  Why then *call* the true *substance like*? Because it
is indeed true, only not of a seed of like condition <span
id="fr_5845"></span>[5846](#fn_5845.md) with our own; but true still, as
being of a nature <span id="fr_5846"></span>[5847](#fn_5846.md) not really
unlike ours. <span id="fr_5847"></span>[5848](#fn_5847.md) And again, in
contrary things there is no likeness. Thus the likeness of flesh would
not be called *spirit*, because flesh is not susceptible of any likeness
to spirit; but it would be called *phantom*, if it seemed to be that
which it really was not. It is, however, called *likeness*, since it is
what it seems to be. Now it is (what it seems to be), because it is on a
par with the other thing (with which it is compared). <span
id="fr_5848"></span>[5849](#fn_5848.md) But a phantom, which is merely such
and nothing else, <span id="fr_5849"></span>[5850](#fn_5849.md) is not a
likeness. The apostle, however, himself here *comes to our aid; for*,
while explaining in what sense he would not have us “live in the flesh,”
<span id="page_460">p. 460</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xiv-Page_460"></span>although in the flesh—even by not
living in the works of the flesh <span
id="fr_5850"></span>[5851](#fn_5850.md) —he shows that when he wrote the
words, “Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,” <span
id="fr_5851"></span>[5852](#fn_5851.md) it was not with the view of
condemning the substance (of the flesh), but the works thereof; and
because it is possible for these not to be committed by us whilst we are
still in the flesh, they will therefore be properly chargeable, <span
id="fr_5852"></span>[5853](#fn_5852.md) not on the substance of the flesh,
but on its conduct. Likewise, if “the body indeed is dead because of
sin” (from which statement we see that not the death of the soul is
meant, but that of the body), “but the spirit is life because of
righteousness,” <span id="fr_5853"></span>[5854](#fn_5853.md) *it follows
that this life* accrues to that which incurred death because of sin,
that is, *as we have just seen*, the body.  Now *the body* <span
id="fr_5854"></span>[5855](#fn_5854.md) is only restored to him who had
lost it; so that the resurrection of the dead implies the resurrection
of their bodies. He accordingly subjoins: “He that raised up Christ from
the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies.” <span
id="fr_5855"></span>[5856](#fn_5855.md) In these words he both affirmed the
resurrection of the flesh (without which nothing can rightly be
called <span id="fr_5856"></span>[5857](#fn_5856.md) body, nor can anything
be properly regarded as mortal), and proved the bodily substance of
Christ; inasmuch as our own mortal bodies will be quickened in precisely
the same way as He was raised; and that was in no other way than in the
body. I have here a very wide gulf of expunged Scripture to leap
across; <span id="fr_5857"></span>[5858](#fn_5857.md) however, I alight on
the place where the apostle bears record of Israel “that they have a
zeal of God”—their own God, of course—“but not according to knowledge.
For,” says he, “being ignorant of (the righteousness of) God, and going
about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted
themselves unto the righteousness of God; for Christ is the end of the
law for righteousness to every one that believeth.” <span
id="fr_5858"></span>[5859](#fn_5858.md) Hereupon we shall be confronted
with an argument of the heretic, that the Jews were ignorant of the
superior God, <span id="fr_5859"></span>[5860](#fn_5859.md) since, in
opposition to him, they set up their own righteousness—that is, the
righteousness of their law—not receiving Christ, the end (or finisher)
of the law. But how then is it that he bears testimony to their zeal for
their own God, if it is not in respect of the same God that he upbraids
them for their ignorance?  They were affected indeed with zeal for God,
but it was not an intelligent zeal: they were, in fact, ignorant of Him,
because they were ignorant of His dispensations by Christ, who was to
bring about the consummation of the law; and in this way did they
maintain their own righteousness in opposition to Him. But so does the
Creator Himself testify to their ignorance concerning Him: “Israel hath
not known me; my people have not understood me;” <span
id="fr_5860"></span>[5861](#fn_5860.md) and as to their preferring the
establishment of their own righteousness, (the Creator again describes
them as) “teaching for doctrines the commandments of men;” <span
id="fr_5861"></span>[5862](#fn_5861.md) moreover, as “having gathered
themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ” <span
id="fr_5862"></span>[5863](#fn_5862.md) —from ignorance of Him, of course.
Now nothing can be expounded of another god which is applicable to the
Creator; otherwise the apostle would not have been just in reproaching
the Jews with ignorance in respect of a god of whom they knew nothing. 
For where had been their sin, if they only maintained the righteousness
of their own God against one of whom they were ignorant? But he
exclaims: “O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God; how
unsearchable also are His ways!” <span
id="fr_5863"></span>[5864](#fn_5863.md) Whence this outburst of feeling?
Surely from the recollection of the Scriptures, which he had been
previously turning over, as well as from his contemplation of the
mysteries which he had been setting forth above, in relation to the
faith of Christ coming from the law. <span
id="fr_5864"></span>[5865](#fn_5864.md) If Marcion had an object in his
erasures, <span id="fr_5865"></span>[5866](#fn_5865.md) why does his
apostle utter such an exclamation, because his god has no riches for him
to contemplate? So poor and indigent was he, that he created nothing,
predicted nothing—in short, possessed nothing; for it was into the world
of another God that he descended. The truth is, the Creator’s resources
and riches, which once had been hidden, were now disclosed. For so had
He promised: “I will give to them treasures which have been hidden, and
which men have not seen will I open to them.” <span
id="fr_5866"></span>[5867](#fn_5866.md) Hence, then, came the exclama<span
id="page_461">p. 461</span> <span id="v.iv.vi.xiv-Page_461"></span>tion,
“O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God!” For His treasures
were now opening out. This is the purport of what Isaiah said, and of
(the apostle’s own) subsequent quotation of the self-same passage, of
the prophet: “Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His
counsellor? Who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to
him again?” <span id="fr_5867"></span>[5868](#fn_5867) Now, (Marcion,.md)
since you have expunged so much from the Scriptures, why did you retain
these words, as if they too were not the Creator’s words? But come now,
let us see without mistake <span id="fr_5868"></span>[5869](#fn_5868.md)
the precepts of your new god: “Abhor that which is evil, and cleave to
that which is good.” <span id="fr_5869"></span>[5870](#fn_5869.md) Well, is
the precept different in the Creator’s teaching? “Take away the evil
from you, depart from it, and be doing good.” <span
id="fr_5870"></span>[5871](#fn_5870.md) *Then again*: “Be kindly
affectioned one to another with brotherly love.” <span
id="fr_5871"></span>[5872](#fn_5871.md) Now is not this of the same import
as: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self?” <span
id="fr_5872"></span>[5873](#fn_5872) (Again, your apostle says:.md)
“Rejoicing in hope;” <span id="fr_5873"></span>[5874](#fn_5873.md) that is,
of God. *So says the Creator’s Psalmist*:  “It is better to hope in the
Lord, than to hope even in princes.” <span
id="fr_5874"></span>[5875](#fn_5874.md) “Patient in tribulation.” <span
id="fr_5875"></span>[5876](#fn_5875) You have (this in.md) the Psalm: “The
Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation.” <span
id="fr_5876"></span>[5877](#fn_5876.md) “Bless, and curse not,” <span
id="fr_5877"></span>[5878](#fn_5877) (says your apostle..md) But what
better teacher of this will you find than Him who created all things,
and blessed them? “Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low
estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.” <span
id="fr_5878"></span>[5879](#fn_5878.md) For against such a disposition
Isaiah pronounces a woe. <span id="fr_5879"></span>[5880](#fn_5879.md)
“Recompense to no man evil for evil.” <span
id="fr_5880"></span>[5881](#fn_5880.md) (Like unto which is the Creator’s
precept:) “Thou shalt not remember thy brother’s evil against
thee.” <span id="fr_5881"></span>[5882](#fn_5881) (Again:.md)  “Avenge not
yourselves;” <span id="fr_5882"></span>[5883](#fn_5882.md) *for it is
written*, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_5883"></span>[5884](#fn_5883.md) “Live peaceably with all
men.” <span id="fr_5884"></span>[5885](#fn_5884.md) The retaliation of the
law, therefore, permitted not retribution for an injury; it rather
repressed any attempt thereat by the fear of a recompense.  Very
properly, then, did he sum up the entire teaching of the Creator in this
precept of His: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” <span
id="fr_5885"></span>[5886](#fn_5885.md) Now, if this is the recapitulation
of the law from the very law itself, I am at a loss to know who is the
God of the law. I fear He must be Marcion’s god (after all). <span
id="fr_5886"></span>[5887](#fn_5886.md) If also the gospel of Christ is
fulfilled in this same precept, but not the Creator’s Christ, what is
the use of our contending any longer whether Christ did or did not say,
“I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it?” <span
id="fr_5887"></span>[5888](#fn_5887) In vain has (our man of.md) Pontus
laboured to deny this statement. <span
id="fr_5888"></span>[5889](#fn_5888.md) If the gospel has not fulfilled the
law, then all I can say is, <span id="fr_5889"></span>[5890](#fn_5889.md)
the law has fulfilled the gospel. But it is well that in a *later* verse
he threatens us with “the judgment-seat of Christ,”—the Judge, of
course, and the Avenger, and therefore the Creator’s (Christ).  This
*Creator*, too, however much he may preach up another god, he certainly
sets forth for us as a Being to be served, <span
id="fr_5890"></span>[5891](#fn_5890.md) if he holds Him thus up as an
object to be feared.

id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p9"></span> This vindication of these terms of the
apostle from *Docetism* is important. The word which our A.V. has
translated *sinful* is a stronger term in the original. It is not the
adjective <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p9.1"></span>ἁμαρτωλοῦ</span>, but the substantive <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p9.2"></span>ἁμαρτίας</span>,
amounting to “flesh of sin,” *i.e.* (as Dean Alford interprets it) “the
flesh whose attribute and character is *sin*.” “The words <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p9.3"></span>ἐν ὁμοιώματι σαρκὸς
ἁμαρτίας</span>, De Wette observes, appear almost to border on Docetism,
but in reality contain a perfectly true and consistent sentiment; <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p9.4"></span>σὰρξ ἁμαρτίας</span>;
is flesh, or human nature, possessed with sin.…The likeness, predicated
in [Rom. viii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md)<span
id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p9.5"></span>, must be referred not only to <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p9.6"></span>σάρξ</span>, but also
to the epithet <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p9.7"></span>τῆς ἁμαρτίας</span>” (*Greek Testament, in
loc.*).

<span id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p13"></span> Censu: perhaps “birth.” This word,
which originally means the *censor’s* registration, is by our author
often used for *origo* and *natura*, because in the registers were
inserted the birthdays and the parents’ names (Oehler).

<span id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p14"></span> It is better that we should give the
original of this sentence.  Its structure is characteristically
difficult, although the general sense, as Oehler suggests, is clear
enough:  “Quia vera quidem, sed non ex semine de statu simili (similis,
*Latinius* and *Junius* and *Semler*), sed vera de censu non vero
dissimili (dissimilis, *the older reading* and *Semler’s*).” We add the
note of Fr. Junius: “The meaning is, that Christ’s flesh is true indeed,
in what they call the identity of its *substance*, although not of its
*origin* (ortus) and *qualities*—not of its original, because not of a
(father’s) seed, as in the case of ourselves; not of qualities, because
these have not in Him the like condition which they have in us.”

<span id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p31"></span> In fidem Christi ex lege venientem.
By “the law” he means the Old Testament in general, and probably refers
to [Rom. x. 17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017.md)<span

<span id="v.iv.vi.xiv-p32"></span> Rigaltius (after Fulvius Ursinus)
read “*non* erasit,” but with insufficient authority; besides, the
context shows that he was referring to the large erasure which he had
already mentioned, so that the *non* is inadmissible.  Marcion must, of
course, be understood to have retained [Rom. xi.

[Next: The First Epistle to the Thessalonians. The Shorter Epistles
Pungent in Sense and Very Valuable. St. Paul Upbraids the Jews for the
Death First of Their Prophets and Then of Christ. This a Presumption
that Both Christ and the Prophets Pertained to the Same God. The Law of
Nature, Which is in Fact the Creator's Discipline, and the Gospel of
Christ Both Enjoin Chastity. The Resurrection Provided for in the Old
Testament by Christ. Man's Compound Nature.](0030461.md)
