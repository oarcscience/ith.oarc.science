id="v.iii.viii-Page_247"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Christ’s Word, Seek, and Ye
Shall Find, No Warrant for Heretical Deviations from the Faith. All
Christ’s Words to the Jews are for Us, Not Indeed as Specific Commands,
But as Principles to Be Applied.</span>

<span id="v.iii.viii-p2"></span>I come now to the point which (is urged
both by our own brethren and by the heretics). Our brethren adduce *it*
as a pretext for entering on curious inquiries, <span
id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929.md) and the heretics insist on it for
importing the scrupulosity (of their unbelief). <span
id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930.md) It is written, they say, “Seek, and
ye shall find.” <span id="fr_1931"></span>[1932](#fn_1931.md) Let us
remember at what time the Lord said this. I think it was at the very
outset of His teaching, when there was still a doubt felt by all whether
He were the Christ, and when even Peter had not yet declared Him to be
the Son of God, and John (Baptist) had actually ceased to feel assurance
about Him. <span id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932.md) With good reason,
therefore, was it then said, “Seek, and ye shall find,” when inquiry was
still be to made of Him who was not yet become known. Besides, this *was
said* in respect of the Jews. For it is to them that the whole
matter <span id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933.md) of this reproof <span
id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934.md) pertains, seeing that they had (a
revelation) where they might seek Christ.

<span id="v.iii.viii-p9"></span>“They have,” says He, “Moses and
Elias,” <span id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935.md) —in other words, the
law and the prophets, which preach Christ; as also in another place He
says plainly, “Search the Scriptures, in which ye expect (to find)
salvation; for they testify of me;” <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936.md) which will be the meaning of “Seek,
and ye shall find.” For it is clear that the next words also apply to
the Jews: “Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937.md) The Jews had formerly been in
covenant with <span id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938.md) God; but being
afterwards cast off on account of their sins, they began to be <span
id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939.md) without God. The Gentiles, on the
contrary, had never been in covenant with God; they were only as “a drop
from a bucket,” and “as dust from the threshing floor,” <span
id="fr_1940"></span>[1941](#fn_1940.md) and were ever outside the door.
Now, how shall he who was always outside knock at the place where he
never was? What door does he know of, when he has passed through none,
either by entrance or ejection?  Is it not rather he who is aware that
he once lived within and was thrust out, that (probably) found the door
and knocked thereat? In like manner, “Ask, and ye shall receive,” <span
id="fr_1941"></span>[1942](#fn_1941.md) is suitably said <span
id="fr_1942"></span>[1943](#fn_1942.md) to one who was aware from whom he
ought to ask,—by whom also some promise had been given; that is to say,
“the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.” Now, the Gentiles knew
nothing either of Him, or of any of His promises. Therefore it was to
Israel that he spake when He said, “I am not sent but to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel.” <span id="fr_1943"></span>[1944](#fn_1943.md) Not
yet had He “cast to the dogs the children’s bread;” <span
id="fr_1944"></span>[1945](#fn_1944.md) not yet did He charge them to “go
into the way of the Gentiles.” <span
id="fr_1945"></span>[1946](#fn_1945.md) It is only at the last that He
instructs them to “go and teach all nations, and baptize them,” <span
id="fr_1946"></span>[1947](#fn_1946.md) when they were so soon to receive
“the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, who should guide them into all the
truth.” <span id="fr_1947"></span>[1948](#fn_1947.md) And this, too, makes
towards the same conclusion. If the apostles, who were ordained <span
id="fr_1948"></span>[1949](#fn_1948.md) to be teachers to the Gentiles,
were themselves to have the Comforter for their teacher, far more
needless <span id="fr_1949"></span>[1950](#fn_1949.md) was it to say to us,
“Seek, and ye shall find,” to whom was to come, without research, <span
id="fr_1950"></span>[1951](#fn_1950.md) our instruction <span
id="fr_1951"></span>[1952](#fn_1951.md) by the apostles, and to the
apostles themselves by the Holy Ghost. All the Lord’s sayings, indeed,
are set forth for all men; through the ears of the Jews have they passed
on to us. Still most of them were addressed to *Jewish* persons; <span
id="fr_1952"></span>[1953](#fn_1952.md) they therefore did not constitute
instruction properly designed <span id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953.md)
for ourselves, but *rather* an example. <span
id="fr_1954"></span>[1955](#fn_1954.md)
