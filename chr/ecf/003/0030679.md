<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c17"><span
id="v.ix.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Postscript.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p3"></span>The learned Dr. Holmes, the translator
of the Second volume of the Edinburgh series, to which our arrangement
has given another position, furnished it with a *Preface* as follows:

<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p4"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="v.ix.xxxii-p4.2"></span>This</span> volume contains all Tertullian’s
*polemical* works (placed in his second volume by <span id="page_628">p.
628</span> <span id="v.ix.xxxii-Page_628"></span>Oehler, whose text we
have followed), with the exception of the long treatise *Against
Marcion*, which has already formed a volume of this series, and the
*Adversus Judæos*, which, not to increase the bulk of the present
volume, appears among the Miscellaneous Tracts.

<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p5"></span>“For the scanty facts connected with our
author’s life, and for some general remarks on the importance and style
of his writings, the reader is referred to the Introduction of my
translation of the *Five Books against Marcion*.

<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p6"></span>“The treatises which comprise this
volume will be found replete with the vigorous thought and terse
expression which always characterize Tertullian.

<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p7"></span>“Brief synopses are prefixed to the
several treatises, and headings are supplied to the chapters: these,
with occasional notes on difficult passages and obscure allusions, will,
it is hoped, afford sufficient aid for an intelligent perusal of these
ancient writings, which cannot fail to be interesting alike to the
theologian and the general reader,—full as they are of reverence for
revealed truth, and at the same time of independence of judgment,
adorned with admirable variety and fulness of knowledge, genial humour,
and cultivated imagination.”

<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p8"></span> ————————————

<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p9"></span>Dr. Holmes further adorned this same
volume with a dedication to a valued friend, in the following words:

<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p10"></span>“*The Right Rev. Father in God*, W. I.
<span class="sc"><span id="v.ix.xxxii-p10.2"></span>Trower</span>, D.D.,
*late Lord Bishop of Gibraltar, and formerly Bishop of Glasgow and
Galway*:

<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p11"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.ix.xxxii-p11.1"></span>My Dear Lord</span>, In one of our
conversations last summer, you were kind enough to express an interest
in this publication, and to favour me with some valuable hints on my own
share in it. It gives me therefore great pleasure to inscribe your
honoured name on the first page of this volume.

<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p12"></span>I avail myself of this public
opportunity of endorsing, on my own account, the high opinion which has
long been entertained of your excellent volumes on *The Epistles* and
*The Gospels*.

<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p13"></span>Recalling to mind, as I often do, our
pleasant days at Pennycross and Mannamead, I remain, my dear Lord, very
faithfully yours, <span class="sc"><span
id="v.ix.xxxii-p13.2"></span>Peter Holmes</span>.”

<span id="v.ix.xxxii-p14"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.ix.xxxii-p14.1"></span>Mannamead</span>, *March* 10, 1870.
