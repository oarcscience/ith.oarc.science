<span id="xv.iii.vi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.v-p1.1"></span>5.  Paul Also Makes Contradictory
Statements About Himself, and Acts in Opposite Ways at Different
Times.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.v-p2"></span>On the same passage one may also make
use of such an example as that of Paul, who at one place <span
id="fr_4999"></span>[5000](#fn_4999.md) says that he is carnal, sold under
sin, and thus was not able to judge anything, while in another place he
is the spiritual man who is able to judge all things and himself to be
judged by no man.  Of the carnal one are the words, “Not what I would
that do I practise, but what I hate that do I.”  And he too who was
caught up to the third heaven and heard unspeakable words <span
id="fr_5000"></span>[5001](#fn_5000.md) is a different Paul from him who
says, Of such an one I will glory, but of myself I will not glory.  If
he becomes <span id="fr_5001"></span>[5002](#fn_5001.md) to the Jews as a
Jew that he may gain the Jews, and to those under the law as under the
law that he may gain those under the law, and to them that are without
law as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to
Christ, that he may gain those without law, and if to the weak he
becomes weak that he may gain the weak, it is clear that these
statements must be examined each by itself, that he becomes a Jew, and
that sometimes he is under the law and at another time without law, and
that sometimes he is weak.  Where, for example, he says something by way
of permission <span id="fr_5002"></span>[5003](#fn_5002.md) and not by
commandment, there we may recognize that he is weak; for who, he
says, <span id="fr_5003"></span>[5004](#fn_5003.md) is weak, and I am not
weak?  When he shaves his head and makes an offering, <span
id="fr_5004"></span>[5005](#fn_5004.md) or when he circumcises
Timothy, <span id="fr_5005"></span>[5006](#fn_5005.md) he is a Jew; but
when he says to the Athenians, <span
id="fr_5006"></span>[5007](#fn_5006.md) “I found an altar with the
inscription, To the unknown God.  That, then, which ye worship not
knowing it, that declare I unto you,” and, “As also some of your own
poets have said, For we also are His offspring,” then he becomes to
those without the law as without the law, adjuring the least religious
of men to espouse religion, and turning to his own purpose the saying of
the poet, “From Love do we begin; his race are we.” <span
id="fr_5007"></span>[5008](#fn_5007.md)   And instances might perhaps be
found where, to men not Jews and yet under the law, he is under the law.
