<span id="xvi.ii.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.ii-p1.1"></span>2.  Why the Pharisees Asked a Sign from
Heaven.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.ii-p2"></span>Now, to this point we have come in our
discourse, because of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming together unto
Jesus, who disagreed in matters relating to the resurrection, but came,
as it were, to an agreement for the sake of tempting our Saviour, and
asking Him to show them a sign from heaven.  For, not satisfied with the
wonderful signs shown among the people in the healing of all forms of
disease and sickness, and with the rest of the miracles which our
Saviour had done in the knowledge of many, they wished Him to show to
them also a sign from heaven.  And I conjecture that they suspected that
the signs upon earth might possibly not be of God; for they did not
hesitate indeed to say, “Jesus casts out demons by Beelzebub the prince
of the demons;” <span id="fr_5558"></span>[5559](#fn_5558.md) and it seemed
to them that a sign from heaven could not spring from Beelzebub or any
other wicked power.  But they erred in regard to both, in regard to
signs upon earth as well as to signs from heaven, not being “approved
money-changers,” <span id="fr_5559"></span>[5560](#fn_5559.md) nor knowing
how to distinguish between the spirits that are working, which kind are
from God, and which have revolted from Him.  And they ought to have
known that even many of the portents wrought against Egypt in the time
of Moses, though they were not from heaven, were clearly from God, and
that the fire which fell from heaven upon the sheep of Job was not from
God; <span id="fr_5560"></span>[5561](#fn_5560.md) for that fire belonged
to the same one as he to whom belonged those who carried off, and made
three bands of horsemen against, the cattle of Job.  I think, moreover,
that in Isaiah—as if signs could be shown both from the earth and from
heaven, the true being from God, but “with all power and signs and lying
wonders” <span id="fr_5561"></span>[5562](#fn_5561.md) those from the evil
one—it was said to Ahaz, “Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God
in the depth or in the height.” <span
id="fr_5562"></span>[5563](#fn_5562.md)   For, unless there had been some
signs in the depth or in the height which were not from the Lord God,
this would not have been said, “Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy
God in the depth or in the height.”  But I know well that such an
interpretation of the passage, “Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy
God,” will seem to some one rather forced; but give heed to that which
is said by the Apostle about the man of sin, the son of perdition, that,
“with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceit of
unrighteousness,” <span id="fr_5563"></span>[5564](#fn_5563.md) he shall be
manifested to them that are perishing, imitating all kinds of wonders,
to-wit, those of truth.  And as the enchanters and magicians of the
Egyptians, as being inferior to the man of sin and the son of perdition,
imitated certain powers, both the signs and wonders of truth, doing
lying wonders so that the true might not be believed; so I think the man
of sin will imitate signs and powers.  And perhaps, also, the Pharisees
suspected these things because of the prophecies concerning Him; but I
inquire whether also the Sadducees tempting Him asked Jesus to show them
a sign from heaven.  For unless we say that they suspected this, how
shall we describe their relation to the portents which Jesus wrought,
who continued hard-hearted and were not put to shame by the miraculous
things that were done?  But if any one supposes that we have given an
occasion of defence to the Pharisees and Sadducees, both when they say
that the demons were cast out by Jesus through Beelzebub, and when
tempting Him, they ask Jesus about a heavenly sign, let him know that we
plausibly say that they were drawn away to the end that they might not
believe in the miracles of Jesus; but not as to deserve <span
id="page_451">p. 451</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.ii-Page_451"></span>forgiveness; for they did not look to
the words of the prophets which were being fulfilled in the acts of
Jesus, which an evil power was not at all capable of imitating.  But to
bring back a soul which had gone out, so that it came out of the grave
when already stinking and passing the fourth day, <span
id="fr_5564"></span>[5565](#fn_5564.md) was the work of no other than Him
who heard the word of the Father, “Let us make man after our image and
likeness.” <span id="fr_5565"></span>[5566](#fn_5565.md)   But also to
command the winds and to make the violence of the sea cease at a word,
was the work of no other than Him through whom all things, both the sea
itself and the winds, have come into being.  Moreover also as to the
teaching which stimulates men to the love of the Creator, in harmony
with the law and the prophets, and which checks passions and moulds
morals according to piety, what else did it indicate to such as were
able to see, than that He was truly the Son of God who wrought works so
mighty?  In respect of which things He said also to the disciples of
John, “Go your way and tell John what great things ye see and hear; the
blind receive their sight,” etc. <span
