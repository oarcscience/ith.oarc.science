<span id="xvi.ii.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.iv-p1.1"></span>4.  Why Jesus Called Them an Adulterous
Generation.  The Law as Husband.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.iv-p2"></span>And He called them, indeed, “an evil
generation,” because of the quality arising from evil which had been
produced in them, for wickedness is voluntary evil-doing, but
“adulterous” because that when the Pharisees and Sadducees left that
which is figuratively called man, the word of truth or the law, they
were debauched by falsehood and the law of sin.  For if there are two
laws, the law in our members warring against the law of the mind, and
the law of the mind, <span id="fr_5571"></span>[5572](#fn_5571) we must
say that the law of the mind—that is, the spiritual—is man, to whom the
soul was given by God as wife, that is, to the man who is law, according
to what is written, “A wife is married to a man by God;” <span
id="fr_5572"></span>[5573](#fn_5572) but the other is a paramour of the
soul which is subject to it, which also on account of it is called an
adulteress.  Now that the law is husband of the soul Paul clearly
exhibits in the Epistle to the Romans, saying, “The law hath dominion
over a man for so long time as he liveth; for the woman that hath a
husband is bound to the husband <span id="page_452">p. 452</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.iv-Page_452"></span>while he liveth, to the husband who is
law,” <span id="fr_5573"></span>[5574](#fn_5573) etc.  For consider in
these things that the law hath dominion over the man so long time as the
law liveth,—as a husband over a wife.  “For the woman that hath a
husband,” that is, the soul under the law, “is bound to the husband
while he liveth,” to the husband who is the law; but if the husband—that
is, the law die—she is discharged from the law, which is her husband. 
Now the law dies to him who has gone up to the condition of blessedness,
and no longer lives under the law, but acts like to Christ, who, though
He became under law for the sake of those under law, that He might gain
those under law, <span id="fr_5574"></span>[5575](#fn_5574) did not
continue under law, nor did He leave subject to law those who had been
freed by Him; for He led them up along with Himself to the divine
citizenship which is above the law, which contains, as for the imperfect
and such as are still sinners, sacrifices for the remission of sins.  He
then who is without sin, and stands no longer in need of legal
sacrifices, perhaps when he has become perfect has passed beyond even
the spiritual law, and comes to the Word beyond it, who became flesh to
those who live in the flesh, but to those who no longer at all war after
the flesh, He is perceived as being the Word, as <span
id="fr_5575"></span>[5576](#fn_5575) He was God in the beginning with
God, and reveals the Father.  Three things therefore are to be thought
of in connection with this place—the woman that hath a husband, who is
under a husband—the law; and the woman who is an adulteress, to-wit, the
soul, which, while her husband, the law, liveth, has become joined to
another husband, namely, the law of the flesh; and the woman who is
married to the brother of the dead husband, to the Word who is alive and
dies not, who “being raised from the dead dieth no more, for death hath
no more dominion over Him.” <span id="fr_5576"></span>[5577](#fn_5576)  
So far then because of the saying, “But if the husband die she is
discharged from the law, the husband,” and because of this, “so then,
while her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if she be
joined to another man,” and because of this, “but if the husband die,
she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress though she be
joined to another man.” <span id="fr_5577"></span>[5578](#fn_5577)   But
this very saying, “So then while her husband liveth, she shall be called
an adulteress,” we have brought forward, wishing clearly to show why in
answer to the Pharisees and Sadducees who were tempting Him and asking
Him to show them a sign from heaven, He said not only “a wicked
generation,” but an “adulterous” generation. <span
id="fr_5578"></span>[5579](#fn_5578)   In a general way, then, the law
in the members which wars against the law of the mind, <span
id="fr_5579"></span>[5580](#fn_5579) as a man who is an adulterer, is an
adulterer of the soul.  But now also every power that is hostile, which
gains the mastery over the human soul, and has intercourse with it,
commits adultery with her who had a bridegroom given to her by God,
namely, the Word.  After these things it is written that “He left them
and departed.”  For how was the bridegroom—the Word—not going to leave
the adulterous generation and depart from it?  But you might say that
the Word of God, leaving the synagogue of the Jews as adulterous,
departed from it, and took a wife of fornication, <span
id="fr_5580"></span>[5581](#fn_5580) namely, those from the Gentiles;
since those who were “Sion, a faithful city,” <span
id="fr_5581"></span>[5582](#fn_5581) have become harlots; but these have
become like the harlot Rahab, who received the spies of Joshua, and was
saved with all her house; <span id="fr_5582"></span>[5583](#fn_5582)
after this no longer playing the harlot, but coming to the feet of
Jesus, and wetting them with the tears of repentance, and anointing them
with the fragrance of the ointment of holy conversation, on account of
whom, reproaching Simon the leper,—the former people,—He spoke those
things which are written. <span id="fr_5583"></span>[5584](#fn_5583)
