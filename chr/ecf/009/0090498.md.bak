<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xxv-p1.1"></span>25.  Chastity and Prayer.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xxv-p2"></span>Now after these things, having
considered how many possible accidents may arise in marriages, which it
was necessary for the man to endure and in this way suffer very great
hardships, or if he did not endure, to transgress the word of Christ,
the disciples say to him, taking refuge in celibacy as easier, and more
expedient than marriage, though the latter appears to be expedient, “*If
the case of the man is so with his* <span id="page_512">p. 512</span>
<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xxv-Page_512"></span>*wife, it is not expedient to
marry.*” <span id="fr_6233"></span>[6234](#fn_6233.md)   And to this the
Saviour said, teaching us that absolute chastity is a gift given by God,
and not merely the fruit of training, but given by God with prayer, “All
men cannot receive the saying, but they to whom it is given.” <span
id="fr_6234"></span>[6235](#fn_6234.md)   Then seeing that some make a
sophistical attack on the saying. “To whom it is given,” as if those who
wished to remain pure in celibacy, but were mastered by their desires,
had an excuse, we must say that, if we believe the Scriptures, why at
all do we lay hold of the saying, “But they to whom it is given,” but no
longer attend to this, “Ask and it shall be given you,” <span
id="fr_6235"></span>[6236](#fn_6235.md) and to that which is added to it,
“For every one that asketh receiveth”? <span
id="fr_6236"></span>[6237](#fn_6236.md)   For if they “to whom it is given”
can receive this saying about absolute purity, let him who wills ask,
obeying and believing Him who said, “Ask and it shall be given
you,” <span id="fr_6237"></span>[6238](#fn_6237.md) and not doubting about
the saying, “Every one that asketh receiveth.” <span
id="fr_6238"></span>[6239](#fn_6238.md)   But when there you will inquire
who it is that asketh, for no one of those who do not receive has asked,
even though he seems to have done so, since it is not lawful to say that
the saying, “Every one that asketh receiveth,” is a lie.  Who then is he
that asketh, but he who has obeyed Jesus when He says, “If ye stand
praying, believe that ye receive, and ye shall receive”? <span
id="fr_6239"></span>[6240](#fn_6239.md)   But he that asketh must do
everything in his power that he may pray “with the spirit” and pray also
“with the understanding,” <span id="fr_6240"></span>[6241](#fn_6240.md) and
pray “without ceasing,” <span id="fr_6241"></span>[6242](#fn_6241.md)
keeping in mind also the saying, “And He spake a parable unto them to
the end that they ought always to pray, and not to faint, saying, There
was in a city a judge,” <span id="fr_6242"></span>[6243](#fn_6242.md) etc. 
And it is useful to know what it is to ask, and what it is to receive,
and what is meant by “Every one that asketh, receiveth,” <span
id="fr_6243"></span>[6244](#fn_6243.md) and by “I say unto you though he
will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his
importunity, he will arise and give him as many as he needeth.” <span
id="fr_6244"></span>[6245](#fn_6244.md)   It is therefore added, “And I say
unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you,” and so on.  Further, let the
saying, “All men cannot receive the saying but they to whom it is
given,” <span id="fr_6245"></span>[6246](#fn_6245.md) be a stimulus to us
to ask worthily of receiving; and this, “What son is there of you who
shall ask his father for a fish, will he for a fish give him a
serpent,” <span id="fr_6246"></span>[6247](#fn_6246.md) etc.  God therefore
will give the good gift, perfect purity in celibacy and chastity, to
those who ask Him with the whole soul, and with faith, and in prayers
without ceasing.
