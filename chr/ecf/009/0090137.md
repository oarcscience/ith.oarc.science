<span id="xii.iv.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—The Order of Ministers in the
Church.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xlii-p2"></span>The apostles have preached the gospel
to us from <span id="fr_4219"></span>[4220](#fn_4219.md) the Lord Jesus
Christ; Jesus <span id="fr_4220"></span>[4221](#fn_4220.md) Christ \[has
done so\] from God.  Christ therefore was sent forth by God, <span
id="fr_4221"></span>[4222](#fn_4221.md) and the apostles by Christ.  Both
these appointments, <span id="fr_4222"></span>[4223](#fn_4222.md) then,
were made in an orderly way, according to the will of God.  Having
therefore received their orders, and being fully assured by the
resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and established <span
id="fr_4223"></span>[4224](#fn_4223.md) in the word of God, with full
assurance of the Holy Ghost, they went forth proclaiming that the
kingdom of God was at hand.  And thus preaching through countries and
cities, they appointed the first fruits \[of their labours\], having
first proved them by the Spirit, <span
id="fr_4224"></span>[4225](#fn_4224.md) to be bishops and deacons of those
who should afterwards believe.  Nor was this any new thing, since indeed
many ages before it was written con<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>
<span id="xii.iv.xlii-Page_242"></span>cerning bishops and deacons.  For
thus saith the Scripture in a certain place, “I will appoint their
bishops <span id="fr_4225"></span>[4226](#fn_4225.md) in righteousness, and
their deacons <span id="fr_4226"></span>[4227](#fn_4226.md) in
faith.” <span id="fr_4227"></span>[4228](#fn_4227.md)
