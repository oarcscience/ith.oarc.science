<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxxv-p1.1"></span>35.  Christ as the Living and the
Dead.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxv-p2"></span>In what has been said about the first
and the last, and about the beginning and the end, we have referred
these words at one point to the different forms of reasonable beings, at
another to the different conceptions of the Son of God.  Thus we have
gained a distinction between the first and the beginning, and between
the last and the end, and also the distinctive meaning of <span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.iii.i.xxxv-p2.1"></span>Α</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.iii.i.xxxv-p2.2"></span>Ω</span>.  It is not
hard to see why he is called <span id="fr_4618"></span>[4619](#fn_4618.md)
“the Living and the Dead,” and after being dead He that is alive for
evermore.  For since we were not helped by His original life, sunk as we
were in sin, He came down into our deadness in order that, He having
died to sin, we, <span id="fr_4619"></span>[4620](#fn_4619.md) bearing
about in our body the dying of Jesus. might then receive that life of
His which is for evermore.  For those who always carry about in their
body the dying of Jesus shall obtain the life of Jesus also, manifested
in their bodies.
