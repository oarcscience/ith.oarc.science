<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xxv-p1.1"></span>25.  Healing Precedes Participation in
the Loaves of Jesus.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xxv-p2"></span>After this the word says, “*And
when* <span id="page_431">p. 431</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xxv-Page_431"></span>*even was come, His disciples came
to Him, saying, The place is desert and the time is already past; send,
therefore, the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and
buy themselves food.*” <span id="fr_5334"></span>[5335](#fn_5334.md)   And
first observe that when about to give to the disciples the loaves of
blessing, that they might set them before the multitudes, He healed the
sick, in order that, having been restored to health, they might
participate in the loaves of blessing; for while they are yet sickly,
they are not able to receive the loaves of the blessing of Jesus.  But
if any one, when he ought to listen to the precept, “But let each prove
himself, and so let him eat of the bread,” etc., <span
id="fr_5335"></span>[5336](#fn_5335.md) does not obey these words, but in
haphazard fashion participates in the bread of the Lord and His cup, he
becomes weak or sickly, or even—if I may use the expression—on account
of being stupefied by the power of the bread, asleep.
