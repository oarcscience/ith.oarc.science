<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>38.  Christ as Paraclete, as
Propitiation, and as the Power of God.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxviii-p2"></span>But none of the names we have
mentioned expresses His representation of us with the Father, as He
pleads for human nature, and makes atonement for it; the Paraclete, and
the propitiation, and the atonement.  He has the name Paraclete in the
Epistle of John: <span id="fr_4628"></span>[4629](#fn_4628.md)   “If any
man sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous.”  And He is said in the same epistle to be the
atonement <span id="fr_4629"></span>[4630](#fn_4629.md) for our sins. 
Similarly, in the Epistle to the Romans, He is called a
propitiation: <span id="fr_4630"></span>[4631](#fn_4630.md)   “Whom God set
forth to be a propitiation through faith.”  Of this proportion there was
a type in the inmost part of the temple, the Holy of Holies, namely, the
golden mercy-seat placed upon the two cherubim.  But how could He ever
be the Paraclete, and the atonement, and the propitiation without the
power of God, which makes an end of our weakness, flows over the souls
of believers, and is administered by Jesus, who indeed is prior to it
and Himself the power of God, who enables a man to say: <span
id="fr_4631"></span>[4632](#fn_4631.md)   “I can do all things through
Jesus Christ who strengtheneth me.”  Whence we know that Simon Magus,
who gave himself the title of “The power of God, which is called great,”
was consigned to perdition and destruction, he and his money with him. 
We, on the contrary, who confess Christ as the true power of God,
believe that we share with Him, inasmuch as He is that power, all things
in which any energy resides.
