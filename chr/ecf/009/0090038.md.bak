<span id="iv.iii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="iv.iii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Section XXIX.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxix-p2"></span>\[1\]  <span
id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995.md) Verily I say unto you, It is
difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of \[2\] heaven.   <span
id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996.md) And I say unto you also, that it is
easier for a camel to enter the eye of \[3\] a needle, than for a rich
man to enter the kingdom of God.   <span
id="fr_1997"></span>[1998](#fn_1997.md) And the disciples were wondering at
these sayings.  And Jesus answered and said unto them again, My
children, how hard it is for those that rely on their possessions to
enter the \[4\] kingdom of God!   <span
id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998.md) And those that were listening
wondered more, and said amongst \[5\] themselves, being agitated, <span
id="fr_1999"></span>[2000](#fn_1999.md) Who, thinkest thou, can be saved? 
 <span id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000.md) And Jesus looked at <span
id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span id="iv.iii.xxix-Page_88"></span>them
intently, and said unto them, With men this is not possible, but with
God *it is:*  \[6\] \[Arabic, p. 111\] it is possible for God to do
everything.   <span id="fr_2001"></span>[2002](#fn_2001.md) Simon Cephas
said unto him, Lo, we have left everything, and followed thee; what is
it, thinkest thou, that we \[7\] shall have?   <span
id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002.md) Jesus said unto them, Verily I say
unto you, Ye that have followed me, in the new world, when the Son of
man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also \[8\] shall sit on
twelve thrones, and shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel.   <span
id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003.md) Verily I say unto you, No man
leaveth houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife,
or children, or kinsfolk, or lands, because of the kingdom of God, or
for \[9\] my sake, and the sake of my gospel,  <span
id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004.md) who shall not obtain <span
id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005.md) many times as much in this \[10\]
time, and in the world to come inherit eternal life:   <span
id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006.md) and now in this time, houses, and
brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with
persecution; \[11\] and in the world to come *ever*lasting life.   <span
id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007.md) Many that are first shall be
last, <span id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008.md) and that are last shall
be first.

<span id="iv.iii.xxix-p17"></span>\[12\]  <span
id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009.md) And when the Pharisees heard all
this, because of their love for wealth they \[13\] scoffed at him. 
 <span id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010.md) And Jesus knew what was in
their hearts, and said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves
before men; while God knows your hearts:  the thing that is lofty with
men is base before God.

<span id="iv.iii.xxix-p20"></span>\[14\]  <span
id="fr_2011"></span>[2012](#fn_2011.md) And he began to say, A *certain*
man was rich, and wore silk and purple, and enjoyed \[15\] himself every
day in splendour:   <span id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012.md) and there
was a poor man named Lazarus, and \[16\] he was cast down at the door of
the rich man,  <span id="fr_2013"></span>[2014](#fn_2013.md) afflicted with
sores, and he longed to fill \[Arabic, p. 112\] his belly with the
crumbs that fell from the table of that rich man; yea, \[17\] even <span
id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014.md) the dogs used to come and lick his
sores.   <span id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015.md) And it happened that
that poor man died, and the angels conveyed him into the bosom of
Abraham:  and the \[18\] rich man also died, and was buried.   <span
id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016.md) And while he was being tormented in
Hades, \[19\] he lifted up his eyes from afar, and saw Abraham
with <span id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017.md) Lazarus in his bosom. 
 <span id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018.md) And he called with a loud
voice, and said, My father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus
to wet the tip of his finger with water, and moisten my tongue \[20\]
for me; for, behold, I am burned in this flame.   <span
id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019.md) Abraham said unto him, My son,
remember that thou receivedst thy good things in thy life, and Lazarus
his afflictions:  \[21\] but now, behold, he is at rest here, and thou
art tormented.   <span id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020.md) And in
addition to all this, there is between us and you a great abyss placed,
so that they that would cross unto you from hence cannot, nor yet from
thence do they cross unto \[22\] us.   <span
id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021.md) He said unto him, Then I beseech
thee, my father, to send him to my father’s \[23\] house;  <span
id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022.md) for I have five brethren; let him
go, that they also sin not, <span id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023.md)
and come to \[24\] the abode of this torment. <span
id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024.md)    <span
id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025.md) Abraham said unto him, They have
Moses and the \[25\] prophets; let them hear them.   <span
id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026.md) He said unto him, Nay, <span
id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027.md) my father Abraham:  but \[26\] let
a man from the dead go unto them, and they will repent.   <span
id="fr_2028"></span>[2029](#fn_2028.md) Abraham said unto him, If they
listen neither to Moses nor to the prophets, neither if a man from the
dead rose would they believe him.

<span id="iv.iii.xxix-p39"></span>\[27\]  <span
id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029.md) The kingdom of heaven is like a man
that is a householder, which went out early \[28\] in the morning to
hire labourers for his vineyard.   <span
id="fr_2030"></span>[2031](#fn_2030.md) And he agreed with the labourers on
\[29\] one penny a day for each labourer, and he sent them into his
vineyard.   <span id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031.md) And he went
\[30\] \[Arabic, p. 113\] out in three hours, and saw others standing in
the market idle.   <span id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032.md) He said
unto them, Go ye also into my vineyard, and what is right I will pay
you.  \[31\]  <span id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033.md) And they went. 
And he went out also at the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise,
\[32\] and sent them.   <span id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034.md) And
about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle.  He
said unto them, Why are ye standing the whole day idle?  \[33\]  <span
id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035.md) They said unto him, Because no one
hath hired us.  He said unto them, Go ye \[34\] also into the vineyard,
and what is right ye shall receive.   <span
id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036.md) So when evening came, the lord of
the vineyard said unto his steward, Call the labourers, and pay them
\[35\] their wages; and begin with the later ones, and end with the
former ones.   <span id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037.md) And \[36\]
those of eleven hours <span id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038.md) came,
and received each a penny.   <span id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039.md)
When therefore the first came, they supposed that they should receive
something more; and they also \[37\] received each a penny.   <span
id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040.md) And when they received *it*, they
spake angrily against the <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xxix-Page_89"></span>\[38\] householder, and said,  <span
id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041.md) These last worked one hour, and
thou hast made them equal \[39\] with us, who have suffered the heat of
the day, and its burden.   <span id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042.md) He
answered and said unto one of them, My friend, I do thee no wrong:  *was
it* not for a penny *that* \[40\] thou didst bargain with me?   <span
id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043.md) Take what is thine, and go thy way;
for I wish to \[41\] give this last as I have given thee.   <span
id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044.md) Or am I not entitled to do with
what is mine <span id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045.md) \[42\] what I
choose?   <span id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046.md) Or is thine eye
perchance evil, because I am good?  Thus shall the last *ones* be first,
and the first last.  The called are many, and the chosen are few.

<span id="iv.iii.xxix-p58"></span>\[43\]  <span
id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047.md) And when Jesus entered into the
house of one of the chiefs of the Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath
day, and they were watching him to see what he would \[44, 45\] do,
 <span id="fr_2048"></span>[2049](#fn_2048.md) and there was before him a
man which had the dropsy,  <span id="fr_2049"></span>[2050](#fn_2049.md)
Jesus answered and \[46\] said unto the scribes and the Pharisees, Is it
lawful on the sabbath to heal?   <span
id="fr_2050"></span>[2051](#fn_2050.md) But \[Arabic, p. 114\] they were
silent.  So he took him, and healed him, and sent him away.  \[47\]
 <span id="fr_2051"></span>[2052](#fn_2051.md) And he said unto them, Which
of you shall *have* his son or his ox fall on the sabbath day into a
well, and not lift him up straightway, and draw water for \[48\] him? 
 <span id="fr_2052"></span>[2053](#fn_2052.md) And they were not able to
answer him a word to that.
