Those on Earth are Typical.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.xii-p2"></span>Now in what manner, in those heavenly
things of which the shadow was present to the Jews on earth, those will
celebrate festivals who have first been trained by tutors and governors
under the true law, until the fulness of the time should come, namely,
above, when we shall be able to receive into ourselves the perfect
measure of the Son of God, this it is the work of that wisdom to make
plain which has been hidden in a mystery; and it also may show to our
thought how the laws about meats are symbols of those things which will
there nourish and strengthen our soul.  But it is vain to think that one
desiring to work out in his fancy the great sea of such ideas, even if
he wished to show how local worship is still a pattern and shadow of
heavenly things, and that the sacrifices and the sheep are full of
meaning, that he should advance further than the Apostle, who seeks
indeed to lift our minds above earthly views of the law, but who does
not show us to any extent how these things are to be.  Even if we look
at the festivals, of which passover is one, from the point of view of
the age to come, we have still to ask how it is that our passover is now
sacrificed, namely, Christ, and not only so, but is to be sacrificed
hereafter.
