<span id="xv.iii.ii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.xvii-p1.1"></span>17.  The Higher Powers are Men; And
Christ is Their Light Also.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xvii-p2"></span>Another, again, appeals to the text,
“Let us make man according to our image and likeness, <span
id="fr_4717"></span>[4718](#fn_4717) ” and maintains that whatever is
made according to God’s image and likeness is man.  To support this,
numberless instances are adduced to show that in Scripture “man” and
“angel” are used indifferently, and that the same subject is entitled
both angel and man.  This is true of the three who were entertained by
Abraham, and of the two who came to Sodom; in the whole course of
Scripture, persons are styled sometimes men, sometimes angels.  Those
who hold this view will say that since persons are styled angels who are
manifestly men, as when Zechariah says, <span
id="fr_4718"></span>[4719](#fn_4718) “The messenger of the Lord, I am
with you, saith the Lord Almighty,” and as it is written of John the
Baptist, <span id="fr_4719"></span>[4720](#fn_4719) “Behold I send My
messenger before thy face,” the angels (messengers) of God are so called
on account of their office, and are not here called men on account of
their nature.  It confirms this view that the names applied to the
higher powers are not those of species of living beings, but those of
the orders, assigned by God to this and to that reasonable being. 
“Throne” is not a species of living being, nor “dominion,” nor
“principality,” nor “power”; these are names of the businesses to which
those clothed with the names have been appointed; the subjects
themselves are nothing but men, but the subject has come to be a throne,
or a dominion, or a principality, or a power.  In Joshua, the son of
Nun, we read <span id="fr_4720"></span>[4721](#fn_4720) that in Jericho
there appeared to Joshua a man who said, “I am captain of the Lord’s
host, now am I come.”  The outcome of this is that the light of men must
be held to be the same as the light of every being endowed with reason;
for every reasonable being is man, since it is according to the image
and likeness of God.  It is spoken of in three different ways, “the
light of men,” and simply “the light,” and “the true light.”  It is the
light of men either, as we showed before, because there is nothing to
prevent us from regarding it as the light of other beings besides men,
or because all beings endowed with reason are called men because they
are made in the image of God.
