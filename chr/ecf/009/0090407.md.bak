<span id="xvi.ii.v.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.x-p1.1"></span>10.  The Answer of Peter.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.x-p2"></span>And perhaps that which Simon Peter
an<span id="page_456">p. 456</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.x-Page_456"></span>swered and said, “*Thou art the Christ,
the Son of the living God,*” <span id="fr_5616"></span>[5617](#fn_5616.md)
if we say it as Peter, not by flesh and blood revealing it unto us, but
by the light from the Father in heaven shining in our heart, we too
become as Peter, being pronounced blessed as he was, because that the
grounds on which he was pronounced blessed apply also to us, by reason
of the fact that flesh and blood have not revealed to us with regard to
Jesus that He is Christ, the Son of the living God, but the Father in
heaven, from the very heavens, that our citizenship may be in
heaven, <span id="fr_5617"></span>[5618](#fn_5617.md) revealing to us the
revelation which carries up to heaven those who take away every veil
from the heart, and receive “the spirit of the wisdom and revelation” of
God. <span id="fr_5618"></span>[5619](#fn_5618.md)   And if we too have
said like Peter, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,” not
as if flesh and blood had revealed it unto us, but by light from the
Father in heaven having shone in our heart, we become a Peter, and to us
there might be said by the Word, “Thou art Peter,” etc. <span
id="fr_5619"></span>[5620](#fn_5619.md)   For a rock <span
id="fr_5620"></span>[5621](#fn_5620.md) is every disciple of Christ of whom
those drank who drank of the spiritual rock which followed them, <span
id="fr_5621"></span>[5622](#fn_5621.md) and upon every such rock is built
every word of the church, and the polity in accordance with it; for in
each of the perfect, who have the combination of words and deeds and
thoughts which fill up the blessedness, is the church built by God.
