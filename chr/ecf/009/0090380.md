<span id="xvi.ii.iv.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>3.  The Exposition of Details Continued. 
The Sitting Down on the Grass.  The Division into Companies.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.iii-p2"></span>We have spoken these things because
of the words, “*They that did eat were five thousand men, beside
children and women,*” <span id="fr_5353"></span>[5354](#fn_5353) which
is an ambiguous expression; for either those who ate were five thousand
men, and among those who ate there was no child or woman; or the men
only were five thousand, the children and the women not being reckoned. 
Some, then, as we have said by anticipation, have so understood the
passage that neither children nor women were present, when the increase
and multiplication of the five loaves and the two fishes took place. 
But some one might say that, while many ate and according to their
desert and capacity participated in the loaves of blessing, some worthy
to be numbered, corresponding to the men of twenty years old who are
numbered in the Book of Numbers, <span
id="fr_5354"></span>[5355](#fn_5354) were Israelitish men, but others
who were not worthy of such account and numbering were children and
women.  Moreover, interpret with me allegorically the children in
accordance with the passage, “I could not speak unto you as unto
spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ;” <span
id="fr_5355"></span>[5356](#fn_5355) and the women in accordance with
the saying, “I wish to present you all as a pure virgin to
Christ;” <span id="fr_5356"></span>[5357](#fn_5356) and the men
according to the saying, “When I am become a man I have put away
childish things.” <span id="fr_5357"></span>[5358](#fn_5357)   Let us
not pass by without exposition the words, “*He commanded the multitudes
to sit down on the grass, and He look the five loaves and the two* <span
id="page_433">p. 433</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iv.iii-Page_433"></span>*fishes, and looking up to heaven, He
blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the
disciples to the multitudes.  And they did all eat.*” <span
id="fr_5358"></span>[5359](#fn_5358)   For what is meant by the words,
“And He commanded all the multitudes to sit down on the grass?”  And
what are we to understand in the passage worthy of the command of
Jesus?  Now, I think that He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the
grass because of what is said in Isaiah, “All flesh is grass;” <span
id="fr_5359"></span>[5360](#fn_5359) that is to say, He commanded them
to put the flesh under, and to keep in subjection “the mind of the
flesh,” <span id="fr_5360"></span>[5361](#fn_5360) that so any one might
be able to partake of the loaves which Jesus blesses.  Then since there
are different orders of those who need the food which Jesus supplies and
all are not nourished by equal words, on this account I think that Mark
has written, “And He commanded them that they should all sit down by
companies upon the green grass; and they sat down in ranks by hundreds
and by fifties;” <span id="fr_5361"></span>[5362](#fn_5361) but Luke,
“And He said unto His disciples, Make them sit down in companies about
fifty each.” <span id="fr_5362"></span>[5363](#fn_5362)   For it was
necessary that those who were to find rest in the food of Jesus should
either be in the order of the hundred—the sacred number—which is
consecrated to God, because of the unit, (in it) or in the order of the
fifty—the number which embraces the remission of sins, in accordance
with the mystery of the Jubilee which took place every fifty years, and
of the feast at Pentecost.  And I think that the twelve baskets were in
the possession of the disciples to whom it was said “Ye shall sit upon
twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” <span
id="fr_5363"></span>[5364](#fn_5363)   And as the throne of him who
judges the tribe of Reuben might be said to be a mystery, and the throne
of him who judges the tribe of Simeon, and another of him who judges the
tribe of Judah, and so on with the others; so there might be a basket of
the food of Reuben, and another of Simeon, and another of Levi.  But it
is not in accordance with our present discourse now to digress so far
from the subject in hand as to collect what is said about the twelve
tribes, and separately what is said about each of them, and to say what
each tribe of Israel may signify.
