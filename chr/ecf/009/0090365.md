<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>14.  The Disciples as Scribes.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xiv-p2"></span>“*Have ye understood all these
things?  They say, Yea.*” <span id="fr_5218"></span>[5219](#fn_5218)  
Christ Jesus, who knows the things in the hearts of men, <span
id="fr_5219"></span>[5220](#fn_5219) as John also taught concerning Him
in the Gospel, puts the question not as one ignorant, but having once
for all taken upon Him the nature of man, He uses also all the
characteristics of a man of which “asking” is one.  And there is nothing
to be wondered at in the Saviour doing this, since indeed the God of the
universe, bearing with the manners of men as a man beareth with the
manners of his son, makes inquiry, as—“Adam, where art thou?” <span
id="fr_5220"></span>[5221](#fn_5220) and, “Where is Abel thy
brother?” <span id="fr_5221"></span>[5222](#fn_5221)   But some one with
a forced interpretation will say here that the words “have understood”
are not to be taken interrogatively but affirmatively; and he will say
that the disciples bearing testimony to His affirmation, say, “Yea.” 
Only, whether he is putting a question or making an affirmation, it is
necessarily said not “these things” only,—which is demonstrative,—not
“all things” only, but “all these things.”  And here He seems to
represent the disciples as having been scribes before the kingdom of
heaven; <span id="fr_5222"></span>[5223](#fn_5222) but to this is
opposed what is said in the Acts of the Apostles thus, “Now when they
beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were
unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled, and they took knowledge of
them that they had been with Jesus.” <span
id="fr_5223"></span>[5224](#fn_5223)   Some one may inquire in regard to
these things—if they were scribes, how are they spoken of in the Acts as
unlearned and ignorant men?  Or if they were unlearned and ignorant men,
how are they very plainly called scribes by the Saviour?  And it might
be answered to these inquiries that, as a matter of fact, not all the
disciples but only Peter and John are described in the Acts as unlearned
and ignorant, but that there were more disciples in regard to whom,
because they understood all things, it is said, “Every scribe,” etc.  Or
it might be said that every one who has been instructed in the teaching
according to the letter of the law is called a scribe, so that those who
were unlearned and ignorant and led captive by the letter of the law are
spoken of as scribes in a particular sense.  And it is very specially
the characteristic of ignorant men, who are unskilled in figurative
interpretation and do not understand what is concerned with the
mystical <span id="fr_5224"></span>[5225](#fn_5224) exposition of the
Scriptures, but believe the bare letter, and, vindicate it, that they
call themselves scribes.  <span id="page_422">p. 422</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xiv-Page_422"></span>And so one will interpret the words,
“Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,” <span
id="fr_5225"></span>[5226](#fn_5225) as having been said to every one
that knows nothing but the letter.  Here you will inquire if the scribe
of the Gospel be as the scribe of the law, and if the former deals with
the Gospel, as the latter with the law, reading and hearing and telling
“those things which contain an allegory,” <span
id="fr_5226"></span>[5227](#fn_5226) so as, while preserving the
historic truth of the events, to understand the unerring principle of
mystic interpretation applied to things spiritual, so that the things
learned may not be “spiritual things whose characteristic is
wickedness,” <span id="fr_5227"></span>[5228](#fn_5227) but may be
entirely opposite to such, namely, spiritual things whose characteristic
is goodness.  And one is a scribe “made a disciple to the kingdom of
heaven” in the simpler sense, when he comes from Judaism and receives
the teaching of Jesus Christ as defined by the Church; but he is a
scribe in a deeper sense, when having received elementary knowledge
through the letter of the Scriptures he ascends to things spiritual,
which are called the kingdom of the heavens.  And according as each
thought is attained, and grasped abstractly <span
id="fr_5228"></span>[5229](#fn_5228) and proved by example and absolute
demonstration, can one understand the kingdom of heaven, so that he who
abounds in knowledge free from error is in the kingdom of the multitude
of what are here represented as “heavens.”  So, too, you will allegorise
the word, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens is at hand,” <span
id="fr_5229"></span>[5230](#fn_5229) as meaning that the scribes—that
is, those who rest satisfied in the bare letter—may repent of this
method of interpretation and be instructed in the spiritual teaching
which is called the kingdom of the heavens through Jesus Christ the
living Word.  Wherefore, also, so far as Jesus Christ, “who was in the
beginning with God, God the word,” <span
id="fr_5230"></span>[5231](#fn_5230) has not His home in a soul, the
kingdom of heaven is not in it, but when any one becomes nigh to
admission of the Word, to him the kingdom of heaven is nigh.  But if the
kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God are the same thing in
reality, <span id="fr_5231"></span>[5232](#fn_5231) if not in idea,
manifestly to those to whom it is said, “The kingdom of God is within
you,” <span id="fr_5232"></span>[5233](#fn_5232) to them also it might
be said, “The kingdom of heaven is within you;” and most of all because
of the repentance from the letter unto the spirit; since “When one turn
to the Lord, the veil over the letter is taken away.  But the Lord is
the Spirit.” <span id="fr_5233"></span>[5234](#fn_5233)   And he who is
truly a householder is both free and rich; rich because from the office
of the scribe he has been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven, in
every word of the Old Testament, and in all knowledge concerning the new
teaching of Christ Jesus, and has this riches laid up in his own
treasure-house—in heaven, in which he stores his treasure as one who has
been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven,—where neither moth doth
consume, nor thieves break through. <span
id="fr_5234"></span>[5235](#fn_5234)   And in regard to him, who, as we
have said, lays up treasure in heaven, we may truly lay down that not
one moth of the passions can touch his spiritual and heavenly
possessions.  “A moth of the passions,” I said, taking the suggestion
from the “Proverbs” in which it is written, “a worm in wood, so pain
woundeth the heart of man.” <span id="fr_5235"></span>[5236](#fn_5235)  
For pain is a worm and a moth, which wounds the heart which has not its
treasures in heaven and spiritual things, for if a man has his treasure
in these—“for where the treasure is, there will the heart be
also,” <span id="fr_5236"></span>[5237](#fn_5236) —he has his heart in
heaven, and on account of it he says, “Though an host should encamp
against me, my heart shall not fear.” <span
id="fr_5237"></span>[5238](#fn_5237)   And so neither can thieves in
regard to whom the Saviour said, “All that came before Me are thieves
and robbers,” <span id="fr_5238"></span>[5239](#fn_5238) break through
those things which are treasured up in heaven, and through the heart
which is in heaven and therefore says, “He raised us up with Him, and
made us to sit with Him in the heavenly places in Christ,” <span
id="fr_5239"></span>[5240](#fn_5239) and, “Our citizenship is in
heaven.” <span id="fr_5240"></span>[5241](#fn_5240)
