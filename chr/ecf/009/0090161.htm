<p class="c24"><a name="xii.v-p3"></A>[<i>From Vol. VII., p. 515 of the Ante-Nicene Fathers</i>.]</p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xii.v-p4"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xii.v-p4.1"></A>The</span> first certain reference which is made by any early writer to this so-called Epistle of Clement is found in these words of Eusebius (<i>Hist. Eccl</i>., iii. 38):&#160; &#8220;We must know that there is also a second Epistle of Clement.&#160; But we do not regard it as being equally notable with the former, since we know of none of the ancients that have made use of it.&#8221;&#160; Several critics in modern times have endeavoured to vindicate the authenticity of this epistle.&#160; But it is now generally regarded. as one of the many writings which have been falsely ascribed to Clement.&#160; Besides the want of external evidence, indicated even by Eusebius in the above extract, the diversity of style clearly points to a different writer from that of the first epistle.&#160; A commonly accepted opinion among critics at the present day is, that this is not an epistle at all, but a fragment of one of the many homilies falsely ascribed to Clement.&#160; There can be no doubt, however, that in the catalogue of writings contained in the Alexandrian <span class="sc"><a name="xii.v-p4.2"></A>ms.</span> it is both styled an epistle, and, as well as the other which accompanies it, is attributed to Clement.&#160; As the <span class="sc"><a name="xii.v-p4.3"></A>ms.</span> is certainly not later than the fifth century, the opinion referred to must by that time have taken firm root in the Church; but in the face of internal evidence, and in want of all earlier testimony, such a fact goes but a small way to establish its authenticity.</p> 
<p class="c24"><a name="xii.v-p5"></A> &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xii.v-p6"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xii.v-p6.1"></A>The</span> second epistle differs from the first in several respects.&#160; The range of Scriptural quotation is wider, the quotations of the first epistle being taken mainly from the Septuagint version of the Old Testament.&#160; The attitude of the writer is in accordance with this fact; it is distinctively Gentile.&#160; For example, Chapter XII. contains a report of words purporting to have been spoken by the Lord; these, Clemens Alexandrinus states, are taken from the Apocryphal Gospel according to the Egyptians, not now extant.&#160; The reference in Chapter XIV. to the spiritual church, recalling <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003">Eph. i. 3-5</a><a name="xii.v-p6.2"></A>, is parallel to the Pastor of Hermas, Vision II. 4.&#160; These passages help to determine the date; for the quotation from the Apocryphal Gospel would not have been made after the four gospels of the New Testament obtained exclusive authority&#8212;toward the close of the second century; while similarity of idea and exposition would seem to make the second epistle and the Pastor of Hermas somewhat contemporaneous.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xii.v-p7"></A>The conclusion of the second epistle, as in the recently discovered <span class="sc"><a name="xii.v-p7.1"></A>ms.</span>, goes to establish the speculation made before this <span class="sc"><a name="xii.v-p7.2"></A>ms.</span> was discovered, that it is a homily to be read in churches.</p>
