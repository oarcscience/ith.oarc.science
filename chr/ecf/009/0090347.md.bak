<span id="xvi.i-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.i-p5.1"></span>According</span> to Eusebius (*H. E*. vi. 36) the
Commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew were written about the same time
as the *Contra Celsum*, when Origen was over sixty years of age, and may
therefore be probably assigned to the period 246–248.  This statement is
confirmed by internal evidence.  In the portion here translated, books
x.–xiv., he passes by the verses [Matt.
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#013.md)<span id="xvi.i-p5.2"></span>, and
refers for the exposition of them to his Homilies on Luke (book xiii.
29).  Elsewhere, he refers his readers for a fuller discussion on
certain points to his Commentaries on John (book xvi. 20), and on Romans
(book xvii. 32).  Of the twenty-five books into which the work was
divided, the first nine, with the exception of two fragments, are lost;
books x.–xvii., covering the portion from [Matt.
13.36-22.33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#036.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p5.3"></span>, are extant in the Greek, and the greater part
of the remaining books survives in a Latin version, which is
co-extensive with the Greek from book xii. 9 to book xvii. 36, and
contains further the exposition from [Matt.
22.34-27.66](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p5.4"></span>.  The passages in Cramer’s *Catena* do not seem
to be taken from the Commentaries.  Of the numerous quotations from
Matthew only one ([Matt. xxi. 35](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#035.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p5.5"></span>) can be definitely traced to this section of the
writings of Origen; and as this differs greatly from our present text,
and is moreover purely narrative, it is probably taken like the others
either from the Scholia (*commaticum interpretationis genus*), or from
the Homilies to which reference is made by Jerome (*Prol. in Matt*. I.
iv).  The majority of them may be ascribed to the Scholia.

<span id="xvi.i-p6"></span>In addition to the <span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.i-p6.1"></span>mss.</span> already referred to (p. 292) the old
Latin version is often useful for determining the text, though it
contains some interpolations and has many omissions.  The omissions (cf.
book xiii. 28, book xiv. 1, 3, book xiv. 19–22) are not due to any
dogmatic bias, but have been made by the translator or some subsequent
transcriber on the ground that the passages were uninteresting or
unimportant.  The version is otherwise for the most part literal, and
has in some cases preserved the correct reading, though it often fails
just when it would have been of most service.  For an estimate of the
work and method of Origen as an exegete, see pp. 290–292; and for a
fuller statement on some of the points here touched upon, see Westcott’s
article on Origen in Smith’s *Dictionary of Christian Biography* (vol.
iv.).
