<span id="xv.iii.v.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>24.  The Name of the Place Where John
Baptized is Not Bethany, as in Most Copies, But Bethabara.  Proof of
This.  Similarly “Gergesa” Should Be Read for “Gerasa,” In the Story of
the Swine.  Attention is to Be Paid to the Proper Names in Scripture,
Which are Often Written Inaccurately, and are of Importance for
Interpretation.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxiv-p2"></span>“These things were done in Bethabara,
beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.” <span
id="fr_4920"></span>[4921](#fn_4920.md)   We are aware of the reading which
is found in almost all the copies, “These things were done in Bethany.” 
This appears, moreover, to have been the reading at an earlier time; and
in Heracleon we read “Bethany.”  We are convinced, however, that we
should not read “Bethany,” but “Bethabara.”  We have visited the places
to enquire as to the footsteps of Jesus and His disciples, and of the
prophets.  Now, Bethany, as the same evangelist tells us, <span
id="fr_4921"></span>[4922](#fn_4921.md) was the town of Lazarus, and of
Martha and Mary; it is fifteen stadia from Jerusalem, and the river
Jordan is about a hundred and eighty stadia distant from it.  Nor is
there any other place of the same name in the neighbourhood of the
Jordan, but they say that Bethabara is pointed out on the banks of the
Jordan, and that John is said to have baptized there.  The etymology of
the name, too, corresponds with the baptism of him who made ready for
the Lord a people prepared for Him; for it yields the meaning “House of
preparation,” while Bethany means “House of obedience.”  Where else was
it fitting that he should baptize, who was sent as a messenger before
the face of the Christ, to pre<span id="page_371">p. 371</span> <span
id="xv.iii.v.xxiv-Page_371"></span>pare His way before Him, but at the
House of preparation?  And what more fitting home for Mary, who chose
the good part, <span id="fr_4922"></span>[4923](#fn_4922.md) which was not
taken away from her, and for Martha, who was cumbered for the reception
of Jesus, and for their brother, who is called the friend of the
Saviour, than Bethany, the House of obedience?  Thus we see that he who
aims at a complete understanding of the Holy Scriptures must not neglect
the careful examination of the proper names in it.  In the matter of
proper names the Greek copies are often incorrect, and in the Gospels
one might be misled by their authority.  The transaction about the
swine, which were driven down a steep place by the demons and drowned in
the sea, is said to have taken place in the country of the
Gerasenes. <span id="fr_4923"></span>[4924](#fn_4923.md)   Now, Gerasa is a
town of Arabia, and has near it neither sea nor lake.  And the
Evangelists would not have made a statement so obviously and
demonstrably false; for they were men who informed themselves carefully
of all matters connected with Judæa.  But in a few copies we have found,
“into the country of the Gadarenes;” and, on this reading, it is to be
stated that Gadara is a town of Judæa, in the neighbourhood of which are
the well-known hot springs, and that there is no lake there with
overhanging banks, nor any sea.  But Gergesa, from which the name
Gergesenes is taken, is an old town in the neighbourhood of the lake now
called Tiberias, and on the edge of it there is a steep place abutting
on the lake, from which it is pointed out that the swine were cast down
by the demons.  Now, the meaning of Gergesa is “dwelling of the
casters-out,” and it contains a prophetic reference to the conduct
towards the Saviour of the citizens of those places, who “besought Him
to depart out of their coasts.”  The same inaccuracy with regard to
proper names is also to be observed in many passages of the law and the
prophets, as we have been at pains to learn from the Hebrews, comparing
our own copies with theirs which have the confirmation of the versions,
never subjected to corruption, of Aquila and Theodotion and Symmachus. 
We add a few instances to encourage students to pay more attention to
such points.  One of the sons of Levi, <span
id="fr_4924"></span>[4925](#fn_4924.md) the first, is called Geson in most
copies, instead of Gerson.  His name is the same as that of the
first-born of Moses; <span id="fr_4925"></span>[4926](#fn_4925.md) it was
given appropriately in each case, both children being born, because of
the sojourn in Egypt, in a strange land.  The second son of Juda, <span
id="fr_4926"></span>[4927](#fn_4926.md) again, has with us the name Annan,
but with the Hebrews Onan, “their labour.”  Once more, in the departures
of the children of Israel in Numbers, <span
id="fr_4927"></span>[4928](#fn_4927.md) we find, “They departed from
Sochoth and pitched in Buthan;” but the Hebrew, instead of Buthan, reads
Aiman.  And why should I add more points like these, when any one who
desires it can examine into the proper names and find out for himself
how they stand?  The place-names of Scripture are specially to be
suspected where many of them occur in a catalogue, as in the account of
the partition of the country in Joshua, and in the first Book of
Chronicles from the beginning down to, say, the passage about Dan, <span
id="fr_4928"></span>[4929](#fn_4928.md) and similarly in Ezra.  Names are
not to be neglected, since indications may be gathered from them which
help in the interpretation of the passages where they occur.  We cannot,
however, leave our proper subject to examine in this place into the
philosophy of names.
