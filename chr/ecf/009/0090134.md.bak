<span id="xii.iv.xxxix-Page_241"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—There is No Reason for
Self-Conceit.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xxxix-p2"></span>Foolish and inconsiderate <span
id="fr_4209"></span>[4210](#fn_4209.md) men, who have neither wisdom <span
id="fr_4210"></span>[4211](#fn_4210.md) nor instruction, mock and deride
us, being eager to exalt themselves in their own conceits.  For what can
a mortal man do, or what strength is there in one made out of the dust? 
For it is written, “There was no shape before mine eyes, only I heard a
sound, <span id="fr_4211"></span>[4212](#fn_4211.md) and a voice
\[saying\], What then?  Shall a man be pure before the Lord?  Or shall
such an one be \[counted\] blameless in his deeds, seeing He does not
confide in His servants, and has charged <span
id="fr_4212"></span>[4213](#fn_4212.md) even His angels with perversity? 
The heaven is not clean in His sight:  how much less they that dwell in
houses of clay, of which also we ourselves were made!  He smote them as
a moth; and from morning even until evening they endure not.  Because
they could furnish no assistance to themselves, they perished.  He
breathed upon them, and they died, because they had no wisdom.  But call
now, if any one will answer thee, or if thou wilt look to any of the
holy angels; for wrath destroys the foolish man, and envy killeth him
that is in error.  I have seen the foolish taking root, but their
habitation was presently consumed.  Let their sons be far from safety;
let them be despised <span id="fr_4213"></span>[4214](#fn_4213.md) before
the gates of those less than themselves, and there shall be none to
deliver.  For what was prepared for them, the righteous shall eat; and
they shall not be delivered from evil.” <span
id="fr_4214"></span>[4215](#fn_4214.md)
