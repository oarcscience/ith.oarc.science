id="xii.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—We are Constantly to Look for
the Kingdom of God.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.xii-p2"></span>Let us expect, therefore, hour by hour,
the kingdom of God in love and righteousness, since we know not the day
of the appearing of God.  For the Lord Himself, being asked by one when
His kingdom would come, replied, “When two shall be one, that which is
without as that which is within, and the male with the female, neither
male nor female.” <span id="fr_4388"></span>[4389](#fn_4388.md)   Now, two
are one when we speak the truth one to another, and there is unfeignedly
one soul in two bodies.  And “that which is without as” that which is
within meaneth this:  He calls the soul “that which is within,” and the
body “that which is without.”  As, then, thy body is visible to sight,
so also let thy soul be manifest by good works.  And “the male, with the
female, neither male nor female,” this <span
id="fr_4389"></span>[4390](#fn_4389.md) He saith, that brother seeing
sister may have no thought concerning her as female, and that she may
have no thought concerning him as male.  “If ye do these things,” saith
He, “the kingdom of my Father shall come.” <span
