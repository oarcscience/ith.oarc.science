<span id="xii.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Continuation of the Above.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.x-p2"></span>Abraham, styled “the friend,” <span
id="fr_4049"></span>[4050](#fn_4049) was found faithful, inasmuch as he
rendered obedience to the words of God.  He, in the exercise of
obedience, went out from his own country, and from his kindred, and from
his father’s house, in order that, by forsaking a small territory, and a
weak family, and an insignificant house, he might inherit the promises
of God.  For God said to him, “Get thee out from thy country, and from
thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, into the land which I shall
show thee.  And I will make thee a great nation, and will bless thee,
and make thy name great, and thou shalt be blessed.  And I will bless
them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee; and in thee shall
all the families of the earth be blessed.” <span
id="fr_4050"></span>[4051](#fn_4050)   And again, on his departing from
Lot, God said to him, “Lift up thine eyes, and look from the place where
thou now art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward; for
all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed
for ever.  And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, \[so
that\] if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed
also be numbered.” <span id="fr_4051"></span>[4052](#fn_4051)   And
again \[the Scripture\] saith, “God brought forth Abram, and spake unto
him, Look up now to heaven, and count the stars if thou be able to
number them; so shall thy seed be.  And Abram believed God, and it was
counted to him for righteousness.” <span
id="fr_4052"></span>[4053](#fn_4052)   On account of his faith and
hospitality, a son was given him in his old age; and in the exercise of
obedience, he offered him as a sacrifice to God on one of the mountains
which He showed him. <span id="fr_4053"></span>[4054](#fn_4053)
