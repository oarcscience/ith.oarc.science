id="xii.vi.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Godliness, Not Gain, the True
Riches.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.xx-p2"></span>But let it not even trouble your mind,
that we see the unrighteous possessed of riches and the servants of God
straitened.  Let us, therefore, brothers and sisters, believe; in a
trial of the living God we strive and are exercised in the present life,
that we may obtain the crown in that which is to come.  No one of the
righteous received fruit speedily, but waiteth for it.  For if God
tendered the reward of the righteous in a trice, straightway were it
commerce that we practised, and not godliness.  For it were as if we
were righteous by following after not godliness but gain; and for this
reason the divine judgment baffled <span
id="fr_4411"></span>[4412](#fn_4411) the spirit that is unrighteous and
heavily weighed the fetter.

<span id="xii.vi.xx-p4"></span>To the only God, invisible, Father of
truth, who sent forth to us the Saviour and Author of immortality,
through whom He also manifested to us the truth and the heavenly life,
to Him be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.
