<span id="xv.iii.i.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xiv-p1.1"></span>14.  The Old Testament, Typified by John,
is the Beginning of the Gospel.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xiv-p2"></span>In addition to what we have said,
there is also this to be considered about the Gospel, that in the first
instance it is that of Christ Jesus, the head of the whole body of the
saved; as Mark says, <span id="fr_4520"></span>[4521](#fn_4520.md) “The
beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.”  Then also it is the Gospel of
the Apostles; whence Paul <span id="fr_4521"></span>[4522](#fn_4521.md)
says, “According to my Gospel.”  But the beginning of the Gospel—for in
respect of its extent it has a beginning, a continuation, a middle, and
an end—is nothing but the whole Old Testament.  John is, in this
respect, a type of the Old Testament, or, if we regard the connection of
the New Testament with the Old, John represents the termination of the
Old.  For the same Mark says: <span id="fr_4522"></span>[4523](#fn_4522.md)
  “The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in
Isaiah the prophet, Behold I send my messenger be<span id="page_305">p.
305</span> <span id="xv.iii.i.xiv-Page_305"></span>fore thy face, who
shall prepare thy way.  The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.”  And here I
must wonder how the dissentients <span
id="fr_4523"></span>[4524](#fn_4523.md) can connect the two Testaments with
two different Gods.  These words, were there no others, are enough to
convict them of their error.  For how can John be the beginning of the
Gospel if they suppose he belongs to a different God, if he belongs to
the demiurge, and, as they hold, is not acquainted with the new deity? 
And the angels are not entrusted with but one evangelical ministry, and
that a short one, not only with that addressed to the shepherds.  For at
the end an exalted and flying angel, having the Gospel, will preach it
to every nation, for the good Father has not entirely deserted those who
have fallen away from Him.  John, son of Zebedee, says in his
Apocalypse: <span id="fr_4524"></span>[4525](#fn_4524.md)   “And I saw an
angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the Eternal Gospel, to
preach it to those who dwell upon the earth, and to every nation, and
tribe, and tongue, and people, saying, with a loud voice, Fear God and
give Him glory, for the hour of His judgment hath come, and worship Him
that made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of
waters.”
