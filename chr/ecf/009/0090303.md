<span id="xv.iii.v.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.xxvii-p1.1"></span>27.  Of Elijah and Elisha Crossing the
Jordan.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxvii-p2"></span>Another point which we must not fail
to notice is that when Elijah was about to be taken up in a whirlwind,
as if to heaven, <span id="fr_4941"></span>[4942](#fn_4941) he took his
mantle and wrapped it together and smote the water, which was divided
hither and thither, and they went over both of them, that is, he and
Elisha.  His baptism in the Jordan made him fitter to be taken up, for,
as we showed before, Paul gives the name of baptism to such a remarkable
passage through the water.  And through this same Jordan Elisha
receives, through Elijah, the gift he desired, saying, “Let a double
portion of thy spirit be upon me.”  What enabled him to receive this
gift of the spirit of Elijah was, perhaps, that he had passed through
Jordan twice, once with Elijah, and the second time, when, after
receiving the mantle of Elijah, he smote the water and said, “Where is
the God of Elijah, even He?  And he smote the waters, and they were
divided hither and thither.”
