<span id="xii.iv.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII.—Let Us Return to the
Practice of Brotherly Love.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xlviii-p2"></span>Let us therefore, with all haste, put
an end <span id="fr_4260"></span>[4261](#fn_4260.md) to this \[state of
things\]; and let us fall down before the Lord, and beseech Him with
tears, that He would mercifully <span
id="fr_4261"></span>[4262](#fn_4261.md) be reconciled to us, and restore us
to our former seemly and holy practice of brotherly love.  For \[such
conduct\] is the gate of righteousness, which is set open for the
attainment of life, as it is written, “Open to me the gates of
righteousness; I will go in by them, and will praise the Lord:  this is
the gate of the <span id="page_244">p. 244</span> <span
id="xii.iv.xlviii-Page_244"></span>Lord:  the righteous shall enter in
by it.” <span id="fr_4262"></span>[4263](#fn_4262.md)   Although,
therefore, many gates have been set open, yet this gate of righteousness
is that gate in Christ by which blessed are all they that have entered
in and have directed their way in holiness and righteousness, doing all
things without disorder.  Let a man be faithful:  let him be powerful in
the utterance of knowledge; let him be wise in judging of words; let him
be pure in all his deeds; yet the more he seems to be superior to others
\[in these respects\], the more humble-minded ought he to be, and to
seek the common good of all, and not merely his own advantage.
