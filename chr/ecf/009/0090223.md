id="xv.iii.i.xxvii-p1.1"></span>27.  Christ as the Truth.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxvii-p2"></span>Further, the Only-begotten is the
truth, because He embraces in Himself according to the Father’s will the
whole reason of all things, and that with perfect clearness, and being
the truth communicates to each creature in proportion to its
worthiness.  And should any one enquire whether all that the Father
knows, according to the depth of His riches and His wisdom and His
knowledge, is known to our Saviour also, and should he, imagining that
he will thereby glorify the Father, show that some things known to the
Father are unknown to the Son, although He might have had an equal share
of the apprehensions of the unbegotten God, we must remind him that it
is from His being the truth that He is Saviour, and add that if He is
the truth complete, then there is nothing true which He does not know;
truth must not limp for the want of the things which, according to those
persons, are known to the Father only.  Or else let it be shown that
some things are known to which the name of truth does not apply, but
which are above the truth.
