<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxix-p1.1"></span>29.  The Coming of the Son of Man in
Glory.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxix-p2"></span>“*For the Son of man shall come in
the glory of His own Father with His angels.*” <span
id="fr_5736"></span>[5737](#fn_5736)   Now, indeed, the Son of man has
not come in His glory; “for we saw Him, and He had no form nor beauty;
but His form was dishonoured and defective compared with the sons of
men; He was a man in affliction and toil, and acquainted with the
enduring of sickness, because His face was turned away, He was
dishonoured and not esteemed.” <span
id="fr_5737"></span>[5738](#fn_5737)   And it was necessary that He
should come in such form that He might bear our sins <span
id="fr_5738"></span>[5739](#fn_5738) and suffer pain for us; for it did
not become Him in glory to bear our sins and suffer pain for us.  But He
also comes in glory, having prepared <span
id="fr_5739"></span>[5740](#fn_5739) the disciples through that epiphany
of His which has no form nor beauty; and, having become as they that
they might become as He, “conformed to the image of His glory,” <span
id="fr_5740"></span>[5741](#fn_5740) since He formerly became conformed
to “the body of our humiliation,” <span
id="fr_5741"></span>[5742](#fn_5741) when He “emptied Himself and took
upon Him the form of a servant,” <span
id="fr_5742"></span>[5743](#fn_5742) He is restored to the image of God
and also makes them conformed unto it.
