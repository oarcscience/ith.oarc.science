<span id="xv.iii.vi.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>8.  How Christ Abides with Believers to
the End of the Age, and Whether He Abides with Them After that
Consummation.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.viii-p2"></span>Some may very likely and not
unreasonably ask, whether, when all the days of this age are over, there
will no longer be any one to say, “Lo, I am with you,” with those,
namely, who received Him till the fulfilment of the age, for the “until”
seems to indicate a certain limit of time.  To this we must say that the
phrase, “I am with you,” is not the same as “I am in you.”  We might say
more properly that the Saviour was not in His disciples but with them,
so <span id="page_386">p. 386</span> <span
id="xv.iii.vi.viii-Page_386"></span>long as they had not arrived in
their minds at the consummation of the age.  But when they see to be at
hand, as far as their effort is concerned, the consummation of the world
which is crucified to them, then Jesus will be no longer with them, but
in them, and they will say, “It is no longer I that live but Christ that
lives in me,” <span id="fr_5012"></span>[5013](#fn_5012) and “If ye seek
a proof of Christ that speaketh in me.” <span
id="fr_5013"></span>[5014](#fn_5013)   In saying this we are keeping for
our part also to the ordinary interpretation which makes the “always”
the time down to the consummation of the age, and are not asking more
than is attainable to human nature as it is here.  That interpretation
may be adhered to and justice yet be done to the “I.”  He who is with
His disciples who are sent out to teach all the nations, until the
consummation, may be He who emptied Himself and took the form of a
servant, and yet afterwards may be another in point of state; afterwards
He may be such as He was before He emptied Himself, until all His
enemies are made by His Father the footstool of His feet; and after
this, when the Son has delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father,
it may be the Father who says to them, “Behold, I am with you.”  But
whether it is “all the days” up to that time, or simply “all the days,”
or not “all days” but “every day,” any one may consider that likes.  Our
plan does not allow us at present to digress so far.
