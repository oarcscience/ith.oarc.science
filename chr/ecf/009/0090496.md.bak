<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>23.  Some Laws Given by Concession to
Human Weakness.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xxiii-p2"></span>But, even if we have seemed to
touch on things too deep for our capacity in the passages, nevertheless,
because of the literal expression these things must further be said,
that some of the laws were written not as excellent, but as by way of
accommodation to the weakness of those to whom the law was given; for
something of this kind is indicated in the words, “Moses for your
hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives;” <span
id="fr_6220"></span>[6221](#fn_6220.md) but that which is pre-eminent and
superior to the law, which was written for their hardness of heart, is
indicated in this, “But from the beginning it hath not been so.”  But in
the new covenant also there are some legal injunctions of the same order
as, “Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your
wives;” for example, because of our hardness of heart, it has been
written on account of our weakness, “But because of fornications, let
each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own
husband;” <span id="fr_6221"></span>[6222](#fn_6221.md) and this, “Let the
husband render unto the wife her due, and likewise also the wife unto
the husband.” <span id="fr_6222"></span>[6223](#fn_6222.md)   To these
sayings it is accordingly subjoined, “But this I say by way of
permission, not of commandment.” <span
id="fr_6223"></span>[6224](#fn_6223.md)   But this also, “A wife is bound
for so long time as her husband liveth, but if her husband be dead, she
is free to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord,” <span
id="fr_6224"></span>[6225](#fn_6224.md) was said by Paul in view of our
hardness of heart and weakness, to those who do not wish to desire
earnestly the greater gifts <span id="fr_6225"></span>[6226](#fn_6225.md)
and become more blessed.  But now contrary to what was written, some
even of the rulers of the church have permitted a woman to marry, even
when her husband was living, doing contrary to what was written, where
it is said, “A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth,”
and “So then if while her husband liveth, she shall be joined to another
man she shall be called an adulteress,” <span
id="fr_6226"></span>[6227](#fn_6226.md) not indeed altogether without
reason, for it is probable this concession was permitted in comparison
with worse things, contrary to what was from the beginning ordained by
law, and written.
