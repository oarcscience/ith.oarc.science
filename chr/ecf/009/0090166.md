<span id="xii.vi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—True Confession of Christ.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.iv-p2"></span>Let us, then, not only call Him Lord, for
that will not save us.  For He saith, “Not every one that saith to me,
Lord, Lord, shall be saved, but he that worketh righteousness.” <span
id="fr_4349"></span>[4350](#fn_4349.md)   Wherefore, brethren, let us
confess Him by our works, by loving one another, by not committing
adultery, or speaking evil of one another, or cherishing envy; but by
being continent, compassionate, and good.  We ought also to sympathize
with one another, and not be avaricious.  By such works let us confess
Him, <span id="fr_4350"></span>[4351](#fn_4350.md) and not by those that
are of an opposite kind.  And it is not fitting that we should fear men,
but rather God.  For this reason, if we should do such \[wicked\]
things, the Lord hath said, “Even though ye were gathered together
to <span id="fr_4351"></span>[4352](#fn_4351.md) me in my very bosom, yet
if ye were not to keep my commandments, I would cast you off, and say
unto you, Depart from me; I know you not whence ye are, ye workers of
iniquity.” <span id="fr_4352"></span>[4353](#fn_4352.md)
