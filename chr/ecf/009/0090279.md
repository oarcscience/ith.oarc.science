<span id="xv.iii.v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.iii-p1.1"></span>3.  “Grace and Truth Came Through Jesus
Christ.”  These Words Belong to the Baptist, Not the Evangelist.  What
the Baptist Testifies by Them.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.iii-p2"></span>We have lingered rather long over
these discussions, but there is a reason for it.  There are many who,
under the pretence of glorifying the advent of Christ, declare the
Apostles to be wiser than the fathers or the prophets; and of these
teachers some have invented a greater God for the later period, while
some, not venturing so far, but moved, according to their own account of
the matter, by the difficulty connected with doctrine, cancel the whole
of the gift conferred by God on the fathers and the prophets, through
Christ, through whom all things were made.  If all things were made
through Him, clearly so must the splendid revelations have been which
were made to the fathers and prophets, and became to them the symbols of
the sacred mysteries of religion.  Now the true soldiers of Christ must
always be prepared to do battle for the truth, and must never, so far as
lies with them, allow false convictions to creep in.  We must not,
therefore, neglect this matter.  It may be said that John’s earlier
testimony to Christ is to be found in the words, “He who cometh after me
exists before me, for He was before me,” and that the words, “For of His
fulness we all received, and grace for grace,” are in the mouth of John
the disciple.  Now, we must show this exposition to be a forced one, and
one which does violence to the context; it is rather a strong proceeding
to suppose the speech of the Baptist to be so suddenly and, as it were,
inopportunely interrupted by that of the disciple, and it is quite
apparent to any one who can judge, in whatever small degree, of a
context, that the speech goes on continuously after the words, “This is
He of whom I spoke, He that cometh after me exists before me, for He was
before me.”  The Baptist brings a proof that Jesus existed before him
because He was before him, since He is the first-born of all creation;
he says, “For of His fulness all we received.”  That is the reason why
he says, “He exists before me, for He was before me.”  That is how I
know that He is first and in higher honour with the Father, since of His
fulness both I and the prophets before me received the more divine
prophetic grace instead of the grace we received at His hands before in
<span id="page_353">p. 353</span> <span
id="xv.iii.v.iii-Page_353"></span>respect of our election.  That is why
I say, “He exists before me, for He was before me,” because we know what
we have received from His fulness; namely, that the law was given
through Moses, not by Moses, while grace and truth not only were given
but came into existence <span id="fr_4823"></span>[4824](#fn_4823)
through Jesus Christ.  For His God and Father both gave the law through
Moses, and made grace and truth through Jesus Christ, that grace and
truth which came to man.  If we give a reasonable interpretation to the
words, “Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ,” we shall not be
alarmed at the possible discrepancy with them of that other saying, “I
am the way and the truth and the life.”  If it is Jesus who says, “I am
the truth,” then how does the truth come through Jesus Christ, since no
one comes into existence through himself?  We must recognize that this
very truth, the essential truth, which is prototypal, so to speak, of
that truth which exists in souls endowed with reason, that truth from
which, as it were, images are impressed on those who care for truth, was
not made through Jesus Christ, nor indeed through any one, but by
God;—just as the Word was not made through any one which was in the
beginning with the Father;—and as wisdom which God created the beginning
of His ways was not made through any one, so the truth also was not made
through any one.  That truth, however, which is with men came through
Jesus Christ, as the truth in Paul and the Apostles came through Jesus
Christ.  And it is no wonder, since truth is one, that many truths
should flow from that one.  The prophet David certainly knew many
truths, as he says, <span id="fr_4824"></span>[4825](#fn_4824) “The Lord
searcheth out truths,” for the Father of truth searches out not the one
truth but the many through which those are saved who possess them.  And
as with the one truth and many truths, so also with righteousness and
righteousnesses.  For the very essential righteousness is Christ, “Who
was made to us of God wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and
redemption.”  But from that righteousness is formed the righteousness
which is in each individual, so that there are in the saved many
righteousnesses, whence also it is written, <span
id="fr_4825"></span>[4826](#fn_4825) “For the Lord is righteous, and He
loved righteousnesses.”  This is the reading in the exact copies, and in
the other versions besides the Septuagint, and in the Hebrew.  Consider
if the other things which Christ is said to be in a unity admit of being
multiplied in the same way and spoken of in the plural.  For example,
Christ is our life as the Saviour Himself says, <span
id="fr_4826"></span>[4827](#fn_4826) “I am the way and the truth and the
life.”  The Apostle, too, says, <span
id="fr_4827"></span>[4828](#fn_4827) “When Christ our life shall appear,
then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.”  And in the Psalms again
we find, <span id="fr_4828"></span>[4829](#fn_4828) “Thy mercy is better
than life;” for it is on account of Christ who is life in every one that
there are many lives.  This, perhaps, is also the key to the
passage, <span id="fr_4829"></span>[4830](#fn_4829) “If ye seek a proof
of the Christ that speaketh in me.”  For Christ is found in every saint,
and so from the one Christ there come to be many Christs, imitators of
Him and formed after Him who is the image of God; whence God says
through the prophet, <span id="fr_4830"></span>[4831](#fn_4830) “Touch
not my Christs.”  Thus we have explained in passing the passage which we
appeared to have omitted from our exposition, viz.:  “Grace and truth
came through Jesus Christ;” and we have also shown that the words belong
to John the Baptist and form part of his testimony to the Son of God.
