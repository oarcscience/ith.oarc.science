<span id="xv.iii.i.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxx-p1.1"></span>30.  Christ as Anointed (Christ) and as
King.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxx-p2"></span>In addition to these titles we must
consider at the outset of our work that of Christ, and we must also
consider that of King, and compare these two so as to find out the
difference between them.  Now it is said in the forty-fourth
Psalm, <span id="fr_4598"></span>[4599](#fn_4598) “Thou hast loved
righteousness and hated iniquity, whence Thou art anointed (Christ)
above Thy fellows.”  His loving righteousness and hating iniquity were
thus added claims in Him; His anointing was not contemporary with His
being nor inherited by Him from the first.  Anointing is a symbol of
entering on the kingship, and sometimes also on the priesthood; and must
we therefore conclude that the kingship of the Son of God is not
inherited nor congenital to Him?  But how is it conceivable that the
First-born of all creation was not a king and became a king afterwards
because He loved righteousness, when, moreover, He Himself was
righteousness?  We cannot fail to see that it is as a man that He is
Christ, in respect of His soul, which was human and liable to be
troubled and sore vexed, but that He is conceived as king in respect of
the divine in Him.  I find support for this in the seventy-first
Psalm, <span id="fr_4599"></span>[4600](#fn_4599) which says, “Give the
king Thy judgment, O God, and Thy righteousness to the king’s Son, to
judge Thy people in righteousness and Thy poor in judgment.”  This
Psalm, though addressed to Solomon, is evidently a prophecy of Christ,
and it is worth while to ask to what king the prophecy desires judgment
to be given by God, and to what king’s Son, and what king’s
righteousness is spoken of.  I conceive, then, that what is called the
King is the leading nature of the First-born of all creation, to which
judgment is given on account of its eminence; and that the man whom He
assumed, formed and moulded by that nature, according to righteousness,
is the King’s Son.  I am the more led to think that this is so, because
the two beings are here brought together in one sentence, and are spoken
of as if they were not two but one.  For the Saviour made both
one, <span id="fr_4600"></span>[4601](#fn_4600) that is, He made them
according to the prototype of the two which had been made one in Himself
before all things.  The two I refer to human nature, since each man’s
soul is <span id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.xxx-Page_314"></span>mixed with the Holy Spirit, and each
of those who are saved is thus made spiritual.  Now as there are some to
whom Christ is a shepherd, as we said before, because of their meek and
composed nature, though they are less guided by reason; so there are
those to whom He is a king, those, namely, who are led in their approach
to religion rather by the reasonable part of their nature.  And among
those who are under a king there are differences; some experience his
rule in a more mystic and hidden and more divine way, others in a less
perfect fashion.  I should say that those who, led by reason, apart from
all agencies of sense, have beheld incorporeal things, the things which
Paul speaks of as “invisible,” or “not seen,” that they are ruled by the
leading nature of the Only-begotten, but that those who have only
advanced as far as the reason which is conversant with sensible things,
and on account of these glorify their Maker, that these also are
governed by the Word, by Christ.  No offence need be taken at our
distinguishing these notions in the Saviour; we draw the same
distinctions in His substance.
