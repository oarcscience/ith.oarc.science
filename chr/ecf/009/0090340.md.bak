<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>25.  Further Spiritualizing of Solomon’s
Temple-Building.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxv-p2"></span>It is worth while to enquire how, on
the one hand, Solomon the king is said to have built the temple, and on
the other the master-builder whom Solomon sent and fetched, <span
id="fr_5127"></span>[5128](#fn_5127.md) “Hiram of Tyre, the son of a woman
who was a widow; and he was of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was
a man of Tyre, a worker in brass, and filled with wisdom and
understanding, to work all works in brass; and he was brought in to King
Solomon and wrought all his works.”  Here I ask whether Solomon can be
taken for the first-born of all creation, <span
id="fr_5128"></span>[5129](#fn_5128.md) and Hiram for the man whom he
assumed, from the constraint of men—for the word Tyrians means
“constrainers”—the man who derived his birth from nature, and being
filled with all manner of art and wisdom and understanding, was brought
in to cooperate with the first-born of all creation, and to build the
temple.  In this temple there are also windows, <span
id="fr_5129"></span>[5130](#fn_5129.md) placed obliquely and out of sight,
so that the illumination of the divine light may enter for salvation,
and—why should I go into particulars?—that the body of Christ, the
Church, may be found having the plan of the spiritual house and temple
of God.  As I said before, we require that wisdom which is hidden in a
mystery, and which he alone can apprehend who is able to say, “But we
have the mind of Christ,”—we require that wisdom to interpret
spiritually each detail of what is said in accordance with the will of
Him who caused it to be written.  To enter into these details is not in
accordance with our present subject.  What has been said may suffice to
let us understand how “He spake about the temple of His body.”
