<span id="xv.iii.ii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>8.  Heracleon’s View that the Logos is
Not the Agent of Creation.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.viii-p2"></span>It was, I consider, a violent and
unwarranted procedure which was adopted by Heracleon, <span
id="fr_4692"></span>[4693](#fn_4692) the friend, as it is said, of
Valentinus, in discussing this sentence:  “All things were made through
Him.”  He excepted the whole world and all that it contains, excluding,
as far as his hypothesis goes, from the “all things” what is best in the
world and its contents.  For he says that the æon (age), and the things
in it, were not made by the Logos; he considers them to have come into
existence before the Logos.  He deals with the statement, “Without Him
was nothing made,” with some degree of audacity, nor is he afraid of the
warning: <span id="fr_4693"></span>[4694](#fn_4693)   “Add not to His
words, lest He find thee out and thou prove a liar,” for to the
“Nothing” he adds:  “Of what is in the world and the creation.”  And as
his statements on the passage are obviously very much forced and in the
face of the evidence, for what he considers divine is excluded from the
all, and what he regards as purely evil is, that and nothing else, the
all things, we need not waste our time in rebutting what is, on the face
of it, absurd, when, without any warrant from Scripture, he adds to the
words, “Without Him was nothing made,” the further words, “Of what is in
the earth and the creation.”  In this proposal, which has no inner
probability to recommend it, he is asking us, in fact, to trust him as
we do the prophets, or the Apostles, who had authority and were not
responsible to men for the writings belonging to man’s salvation, which
they handed to those about them and to those who should come after.  He
had, also, a private interpretation of his own of the words:  “All
things were made through Him,” when he said that it was the Logos who
caused the demiurge to make the world, not, however, the Logos from whom
or by whom, but Him through whom, taking the written words in a
different sense from that of common parlance. <span
id="fr_4694"></span>[4695](#fn_4694)   For, if the truth of the matter
was as he considers, then the writer ought to have said that all things
were made through the demiurge by the Word, and not through the Word by
the demiurge.  We accept the “through whom,” as it is usually
understood, and have brought evidence in support of our interpretation,
while he not only puts forward a new rendering of his own, unsupported
by the divine Scripture, but appears even to scorn the truth and
shamelessly and openly oppose it.  For he says:  “It was not the Logos
who made all things, as under another who was the operating agent,”
taking the “through whom” in this sense, “but another made them, the
Logos Himself being the operating agent.”  This is not a suitable
occasion for the proof that it was not the demiurge who became the
servant of the Logos and made the world; but that the Logos became the
servant of the demiurge and formed the world.  For, according to the
prophet David, <span id="fr_4695"></span>[4696](#fn_4695) “God spake and
they came into being, He commanded and they were created.”  For the
unbegotten God commanded the first-born of all creation, <span
id="fr_4696"></span>[4697](#fn_4696) and they were created, not only the
world and what is therein, but also all other things, whether thrones or
dominions or principalities or powers, for all things were made through
Him and unto Him, and He is before all things.”
