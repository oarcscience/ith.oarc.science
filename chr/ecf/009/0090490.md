<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xvii-p1.1"></span>17.  Union of Christ and the
Church.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xvii-p2"></span>But since the Apostle understands
the words, “*And they twain shall be one flesh,*” <span
id="fr_6175"></span>[6176](#fn_6175.md) of Christ and the church, <span
id="fr_6176"></span>[6177](#fn_6176.md) we must say that Christ keeping the
saying, “What God hath joined together let not man put asunder,” <span
id="fr_6177"></span>[6178](#fn_6177.md) did not put away His former wife,
so to speak—that is, the former synagogue—for any other cause than that
that wife committed fornication, being made an adulteress by the evil
one, and along with him plotted against her husband and slew Him,
saying, “Away with such a fellow from the earth, crucify Him, crucify
Him.” <span id="fr_6178"></span>[6179](#fn_6178.md)   It was she therefore
who herself revolted, rather than her husband who put her away and
dismissed her; wherefore, reproaching her for falling away from him, it
says in Isaiah, “Of what kind is the bill of your mother’s divorcement,
with which I sent her away?” <span id="fr_6179"></span>[6180](#fn_6179.md)
  And He who at the beginning created Him “who is in the form of God”
after the image, made Him male, and the church female, granting to both
oneness after the image.  And, for the sake of the church, the Lord—the
husband—left the Father whom He saw when He was “in the form of
God,” <span id="fr_6180"></span>[6181](#fn_6180.md) left also His mother,
as He was the very son of the Jerusalem which is above, and was joined
to His wife who had fallen down here, and these two here became one
<span id="page_507">p. 507</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xvii-Page_507"></span>flesh.  For because of her, He
Himself also became flesh, when “the Word became flesh and dwelt among
us,” <span id="fr_6181"></span>[6182](#fn_6181.md) and they are no more
two, but now they are one flesh, since it is said to the wife, “Now ye
are the body of Christ, and members each in his part;” <span
id="fr_6182"></span>[6183](#fn_6182.md) for the body of Christ is not
something apart different from the church, which is His body, and from
the members each in his part.  And God has joined together these who are
not two, but have become one flesh, commanding that men should not
separate the church from the Lord.  And he who takes heed for himself so
as not to be separated, is confident as one who will not possibly be
separated and says, “Who shall separate us from the love of
Christ?” <span id="fr_6183"></span>[6184](#fn_6183.md)   Here, therefore,
the saying, “What God hath joined together, let not man put
asunder,” <span id="fr_6184"></span>[6185](#fn_6184.md) was written with
relation to the Pharisees, but to those who are superior to the
Pharisees, it could be said, “What then God hath joined together, let
nothing put asunder,” neither principality nor power; for God, who has
joined together is stronger than all those which any one could conceive
and name.
