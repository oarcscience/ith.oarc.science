id="xv.iii.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>15.  Heracleon’s View that the Lord
Brought Life Only to the Spiritual.  Refutation of This.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xv-p2"></span>Heracleon adopts a somewhat violent
course when he arrives at this passage, “What was made in Him was
life.”  Instead of the “In Him” of the text he understands “to those men
who are spiritual,” as if he considered the Logos and the spiritual to
be identical, though this he does not plainly say; and then he proceeds
to give, as it were, an account of the origin of the matter and says,
“He (the Logos) provided them with their first form at their birth,
carrying further and making manifest what had been sown by
another, <span id="fr_4712"></span>[4713](#fn_4712) into form and into
illumination and into an outline of its own.”  He did not observe how
Paul speaks of the spiritual, <span id="fr_4713"></span>[4714](#fn_4713)
and how he refrains from saying that they are men.  “A natural man
receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness
to him; but the spiritual judgeth all things.”  We maintain that it was
not without a meaning that he did not add the word *men* to the word
*spiritual*.  Spiritual is something better than man, for man receives
his form either in soul, or in body, or in both together, not in what is
more divine than these, namely, in spirit; and it is after he has come
to have a prevailing share of this that he is called “spiritual.” 
Moreover, in bringing forward such a hypothesis as this, he furnishes
not even the pretence of a proof, and shows himself unable to reach even
a moderate degree of plausibility for his argument on the subject.  So
much, then, for him.
