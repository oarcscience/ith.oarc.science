<span id="xvi.ii.vi.i-p2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.i-p2.1"></span>1.  Relation of the Baptist to Elijah.  The
Theory of Transmigration Considered.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.i-p3"></span>“*The disciples asked Him, saying, Why
then say the scribes that Elijah must first come*?” <span
id="fr_5822"></span>[5823](#fn_5822.md)   The disciples indeed who went up
with Jesus remembered the traditions of the scribes concerning Elijah,
that before the advent of Christ, Elijah would come and prepare for Him
the souls of those who were going to receive Him.  But the vision in the
mountain, at which Elijah appeared, did not seem to be in harmony with
the things which were said, since to them it seemed that Elijah had not
come before Jesus but after Him; wherefore, they say these things,
thinking that the scribes lied.  But to this the Saviour answers, not
setting aside the traditions concerning Elijah, but saying that there
was another advent of Elijah before that of Christ of which the scribes
were ignorant; and, in regard to this, being ignorant of him, they “had
done unto him whatsoever they listed,” <span
id="fr_5823"></span>[5824](#fn_5823.md) as if they had been accomplices in
his having been cast into prison by Herod and slain by him; then He says
that according as they had done towards Elijah so would He suffer at
their hands. <span id="fr_5824"></span>[5825](#fn_5824.md)   And these
things indeed as about Elijah the disciples asked and the Saviour
answered, but when they heard they understood that the words, “Elijah
has already come,” and that following which was spoken by the Saviour,
had reference to John the Baptist. <span
id="fr_5825"></span>[5826](#fn_5825.md)   And let these things be said by
way of illustration of the passage before us.  But now according to our
ability let us make investigation also into the things that are stored
up in it.  In this place it does not appear to me that by Elijah the
soul is spoken of, lest I should fall into the dogma of transmigration,
which is foreign to the church of God, and not handed down by the
Apostles, nor anywhere set forth in the Scriptures; for it is also in
opposition to the saying that “things seen are temporal,” <span
id="fr_5826"></span>[5827](#fn_5826.md) and that “this age shall have a
consummation,” and also to the fulfilment of the saying, “Heaven and
earth shall pass away,” <span id="fr_5827"></span>[5828](#fn_5827.md) and
“the fashion of this world passeth away,” <span
id="fr_5828"></span>[5829](#fn_5828.md) and “the heavens shall
perish,” <span id="fr_5829"></span>[5830](#fn_5829.md) and what follows. 
For if, by hypothesis, in the constitution of things which has existed
from the beginning unto the end of the world, the same soul can be twice
in the body, for what cause should it be in it?  For if because of sin
it should be twice in the body, why should it not be thrice, and
repeatedly in it, since punishments, in respect of this life, and of the
sins committed in it, shall be rendered to it only by the method of
transmigration?  But if this be granted as a consequence, perhaps there
will never be a time when a soul shall not undergo transmigration:  for
always because of its former sins will it dwell in the body; and so
there will be no place for the corruption of the world, at which “the
heaven and the earth shall pass away.” <span
id="fr_5830"></span>[5831](#fn_5830.md)   And if it be granted, on this
hypothesis, that one who is absolutely sinless shall not come into the
body by birth, after what length of time do you suppose that a soul
shall be found absolutely pure and needing no transmigration?  But
nevertheless, also, if any one soul is always thus being removed from
the definite number of souls and returns no longer to the body, sometime
after infinite ages, as it were, birth shall cease; the world being
reduced to some one or two or a few more, after the perfecting of whom
the world shall perish, the supply of souls coming into the body having
failed.  But this is not agreeable to the Scripture; for it knows of a
multitude of sinners at the time of the destruction of the world.  This
is manifest from consideration of the saying, “How-beit when the Son of
man cometh shall He find faith on the earth?” <span
id="fr_5831"></span>[5832](#fn_5831.md)   So we find it thus said in
Matthew, “As were the days of Noah so shall also be the coming of the
Son of man; for as they were in the days of the flood,” etc. <span
id="fr_5832"></span>[5833](#fn_5832.md)   But to those who are then in
existence there shall be the exaction of a penalty for their sins, but
not by way of transmigration; for, if they are caught while still
sinning, either they will be punished after this by a different form of
punishment,—and according to this either there will be two general forms
of punishment, the one by way of transmigration, and the other <span
id="page_475">p. 475</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vi.i-Page_475"></span>outside of a body of this kind, and let
them declare the causes and differences of these,—or they will not be
punished, as if those who were left at the consummation of things had
forthwith cast away their sins; or, which is better, there is one form
of punishment for those who have sinned in the body, namely, that they
should suffer, outside of it, that is, outside the constitution of this
life, what is according to the desert of their sins.  But to one who has
insight into the nature of things it is clear that each of these things
is fitted to overturn the doctrine of transmigration.  But if, of
necessity, the Greeks who introduce the doctrine of transmigration,
laying down things in harmony with it, do not acknowledge that the world
is coming to corruption, it is fitting that when they have looked the
Scriptures straight in the face which plainly declare that the world
will perish, they should either disbelieve them, or invent a series of
arguments in regard to the interpretation of the things concerning the
consummation; which even if they wish they will not be able to do.  And
this besides we will say to those who may have had the hardihood to aver
that the world will not perish, that, if the world does not perish but
is to exist for infinite periods of time, there will be no God knowing
all things before they come into being.  But if, perhaps, He knows in
part, either He will know each thing before it comes into being, or
certain things, and after these again other things; for things infinite
in nature cannot possibly be grasped by that knowledge whose nature it
is to limit things known.  From this it follows that there cannot be
prophecies about all things whatsoever, since all things are infinite.
