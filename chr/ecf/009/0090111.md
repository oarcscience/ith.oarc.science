<span id="xii.iv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Christ as an Example of
Humility.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xvi-p2"></span>For Christ is of those who are
humble-minded, and not of those who exalt themselves over His flock. 
Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sceptre of the majesty of God, did not come
in the pomp of pride or arrogance, although He might have done so, but
in a lowly condition, as the Holy Spirit had declared regarding Him. 
For He says, “Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm
of the Lord revealed?  We have declared \[our message\] in His
presence:  He is, as it were, a child, and like a root in thirsty
ground; He has no form nor glory, yea, we saw Him, and He had no form
nor comeliness; but His form was without eminence, yea, deficient in
comparison with the \[ordinary\] form of men.  He is a man exposed to
stripes and suffering, and acquainted with the endurance of grief:  for
His countenance was turned away; He was despised, and not esteemed.  He
bears our iniquities, and is in sorrow for our sakes; yet we supposed
that \[on His own account\] He was exposed to labour, and stripes, and
affliction.  But He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for
our iniquities.  <span id="page_234">p. 234</span> <span
id="xii.iv.xvi-Page_234"></span>The chastisement of our peace was upon
Him, and by His stripes we were healed.  All we, like sheep, have gone
astray; \[every\] man has wandered in his own way; and the Lord has
delivered Him up for our sins, while He in the midst of His sufferings
openeth not His mouth.  He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and
as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth.  In
His humiliation His judgment was taken away; who shall declare His
generation? for His life is taken from the earth.  For the
transgressions of my people was He brought down to death.  And I will
give the wicked for His sepulchre, and the rich for His death, <span
id="fr_4072"></span>[4073](#fn_4072) because He did no iniquity, neither
was guile found in His mouth.  And the Lord is pleased to purify him by
stripes. <span id="fr_4073"></span>[4074](#fn_4073)   If ye make <span
id="fr_4074"></span>[4075](#fn_4074) an offering for sin, your soul
shall see a long-lived seed.  And the Lord is pleased to relieve Him of
the affliction of His soul, to show Him light, and to form Him with
understanding, <span id="fr_4075"></span>[4076](#fn_4075) to justify the
Just One who ministereth well to many; and He Himself shall carry their
sins.  On this account He shall inherit many, and shall divide the spoil
of the strong; because His soul was delivered to death, and He was
reckoned among the transgressors, and He bare the sins of many, and for
their sins was He delivered.” <span id="fr_4076"></span>[4077](#fn_4076)
  And again He saith, “I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and
despised of the people.  All that see me have derided me; they have
spoken with their lips; they have wagged their head, \[saying\] He hoped
in God, let Him deliver Him, let Him save Him, since He delighteth in
Him.” <span id="fr_4077"></span>[4078](#fn_4077)   Ye see, beloved, what
is the example which has been given us; for if the Lord thus humbled
Himself, what shall we do who have through Him come under the yoke of
His grace?

<span id="xii.iv.xvi-p3"></span> The Latin of Cotelerius, adopted by
Hefele and Dressel, translates this clause as follows:  “I will set free
the wicked on account of His sepulchre, and the rich on account of His
death.”

<span id="xii.iv.xvi-p4"></span> The reading of the <span

class="Greek"><span id="xii.iv.xvi-p4.2"></span>τῆς πληγῆς</span>,
“purify, or free Him, from stripes.”  We have adopted the emendation of
Junius.

<span id="xii.iv.xvi-p6"></span> Or, “*fill* Him with understanding,” if
<span class="Greek"><span id="xii.iv.xvi-p6.1"></span>πλῆσαι</span>
should be read instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="xii.iv.xvi-p6.2"></span>πλάσαι</span> as Grabe suggests.
