<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.xxi-p1.1"></span>21.  That the Son Was Raised Up by the
Father.  The Charge Brought Against Jesus at His Trial Was Based on the
Incident Now Before Us.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxi-p2"></span>What I have said is not alien to the
passage now engaging us, dealing as it does with the temple and those
cast out from it, of which the Saviour says, “The zeal of thy house
shall devour Me;” and with the Jews who asked that a sign should be
showed them, and the Saviour’s answer to them, in which He combines the
discourse on the temple with that on His own body, and says, “Destroy
this temple and in three days I will raise it up.”  For from this
temple, which is the body of Christ, everything that is irrational and
savours of merchandise must be driven away, that it may no longer be a
house of merchandise.  And this temple must be destroyed by those who
plot against the Word of God, and after its destruction be raised again
on that third day which we discussed above; when the disciples also will
remember what He, the Word, said before the temple of God was destroyed,
and will believe, not only their knowledge but their faith also being
then made perfect, and that by the word which Jesus spoke.  And every
one who is of this nature, Jesus purifying him, <span
id="fr_5098"></span>[5099](#fn_5098) puts away things that are
irrational and things that savour of selling, to be destroyed on account
of the zeal of the <span id="page_402">p. 402</span> <span
id="xv.iii.vi.xxi-Page_402"></span>Logos that is in Him.  But they are
destroyed to be raised again by Jesus, not on the third day, if we
attend to the exact words before us, but “in three days.”  For the
rising again of the temple takes place on the first day after it has
been destroyed and on the second day, and its resurrection is
accomplished in all the three days.  Hence a resurrection both has been
and is to be, if indeed we were buried with Christ, and rose with Him. 
And since the word, “We rose with Him,” does not cover the whole of the
resurrection, “in Christ shall all be made alive, <span
id="fr_5099"></span>[5100](#fn_5099) but every one in his own order,
Christ the first fruits, then they that are Christ’s at His coming, and
then the end.”  It belongs to the resurrection that one should be on the
first day in the paradise of God, <span
id="fr_5100"></span>[5101](#fn_5100) and it belongs to the resurrection
when Jesus appears and says, “Touch Me not; for I am not yet ascended to
My Father,” <span id="fr_5101"></span>[5102](#fn_5101) but the
perfection of the resurrection was when He came to the Father.  Now
there are some who fall into confusion on this head of the Father and
the Son, and we must devote a few words to them.  They quote the
text, <span id="fr_5102"></span>[5103](#fn_5102) “Yea, and we are found
false witnesses for God, because we testified against God that He raised
up Christ, whom He raised not up,” and other similar texts which show
the raiser-up to be another person than He who was raised up; and the
text, “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up,” as if
it resulted from these that the Son did not differ in number from the
Father, but that both were one, not only in point of substance but in
point of subject, and that the Father and the Son were said to be
different in some of their aspects but not in their hypostases.  Against
such views we must in the first place adduce the leading texts which
prove the Son to be another than the Father, and that the Son must of
necessity be the son of a Father, and the Father, the father of a Son. 
Then we may very properly refer to Christ’s declaration that He cannot
do anything but what He sees the Father doing and saying, <span
id="fr_5103"></span>[5104](#fn_5103) because whatever the Father does
that the Son also does in like manner, and that He had raised the dead,
i.e., the body, the Father granting Him this, who must be said to have
been the principal agent in raising up Christ from the dead.  But
Heracleon says, “In three days,” instead of “On the third day,” not
having examined the point (and yet having noted the words “in three”),
that the resurrection is brought about in three days.  But he also calls
the third the spiritual day, in which they consider the resurrection of
the Church to be indicated.  It follows from this that the first day is
to be called the “earthly” day, and the second the psychical, the
resurrection of the Church not having taken place on them.  Now the
statements of the false witnesses, recorded in the Gospel according to
Matthew and Mark <span id="fr_5104"></span>[5105](#fn_5104) towards the
end of the Gospel, and the accusation they brought against our Lord
Jesus Christ, appear to have reference to this utterance of His,
“Destroy this temple, and I will build it up in three days.”  For He was
speaking of the temple of His body, but they supposed His words to refer
to the temple of stone, and so they said when accusing Him, “This man
said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it up in three
days,” or, as Mark has it, “We heard Him say, that I will destroy this
temple made with hands, and in three days I will build up another temple
not made with hands.”  Here the high-priest stood up and said to Him,
“Answerest Thou nothing?  What do these witness against Thee?  But Jesus
held His peace.”  Or, as Mark says, “And the high-priest stood up in the
midst, and asked Jesus saying, Answerest Thou nothing?  What do these
witness against Thee?  But He held His peace and answered nothing.” 
These words must, I think, necessarily have reference to the text now
before us.
