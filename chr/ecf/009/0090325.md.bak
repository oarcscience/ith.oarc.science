<span id="xv.iii.vi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.x-p1.1"></span>10.  Significance of Capernaum.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.x-p2"></span>Matthew for his part adds, <span
id="fr_5016"></span>[5017](#fn_5016.md) that when the Lord had entered into
Capernaum the centurion came to him, saying, “My boy is lying in my
house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented,” and after telling the
Lord some more about him, received the reply, “Go, and as thou hast
believed, so be it unto thee.”  And Matthew then gives us the story of
Peter’s mother-in-law, in close agreement with the other two.  I
conceive it to be a creditable piece of work and becoming to one who is
anxious to hear about Christ, to collect from the four Gospels all that
is related about Capernaum, and the discourses spoken, and the works
done there, and how many visits the Lord paid to the place, and how, at
one time, He is said to have gone down to it, and at another to have
entered into it, and where He came from when He did so.  If we compare
all these points together, we shall not go astray in the meaning we
ascribe to Capernaum.  On the one hand, the sick are healed, and other
works of power are done there, and on the other, the preaching, Repent
ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand, begins there, and this appears
to be a sign, as we showed when entering on this subject, of some more
needy place of consolation, made so perhaps by Jesus, who comforted men
by what He taught and by what He did there, in that place of
consolation.  For we know that the names of places agree in their
meaning with the things connected with Jesus; as Gergesa, where the
citizens of these parts besought Him to depart out of their coasts,
means, “The dwelling of the casters-out.”  And this, also, we have
noticed about Capernaum, that not only did the preaching, “Repent ye,
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,” begin there, but that according
to the three Evangelists Jesus performed there His first miracles.  None
of the three, however, added to the first wonders which he records as
done in Capernaum, that note attached by John the disciple to the first
work of Jesus, “This beginning of His signs did Jesus in Cana of
Galilee.”  For that which was done in Capernaum was not the beginning of
the signs, since the leading sign of the Son of God was good cheer, and
in the light of human experience it is also the most representative of
Him.  For the Word of God does not show forth His own beauty so much in
healing the sick, as in His tendering the temperate draught to make glad
those who are in good health and are able to join in the banquet.
