id="xvi.ii.v.viii-p1.1"></span>8.  The Leaven Figurative Like the Water
Spoken of by Jesus to the Woman of Samaria.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.viii-p2"></span>But I wonder if the disciples
thought, before the saying was explained to them by Jesus, that their
Teacher and Lord was forbidding them to beware of the sensible leaven of
the Pharisees or the Sadducees as impure, and on this account forbidden,
lest they might use that leaven because they had not taken loaves.  And
we might make a like inquiry in regard to other things; but by-way of
illustration the narrative about the woman of Samaria sufficeth, “Every
one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever
drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.” <span
id="fr_5603"></span>[5604](#fn_5603.md)   For there, also, so far as the
mere form of ex<span id="page_455">p. 455</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.viii-Page_455"></span>pression is concerned, the Samaritan
woman would seem to have thought that the Saviour was giving a promise
about sensible water, when He said, “Whosoever drinketh of the water
that I shall give him shall never thirst.”  And those things then must
be figuratively interpreted, and we must examine and compare the water
of the spring of Jacob from which the woman of Samaria drew water with
the water of Jesus; and here the like must be done; for perhaps the
loaves were not baked, but a kind of raw leaven solely, the teaching,
namely, of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
