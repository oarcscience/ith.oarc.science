<p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.vii.xxi-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.vii.xxi-p1.1"></A>21.&#160; Union of Angels and the Souls of Men.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.vii.xxi-p2"></A>But some one may inquire whether the human soul can be figuratively called a wife, and the angel who is set over her and is her ruler, with whom as her sovereign she holds conversation, can be called her husband; so that according to this each lawfully dwells along with the soul which is worthy of the guardianship of a divine angel; but sometimes after long sojourning and intercourse a cause may arise in the soul why she does not find favour in the eyes of the angel who is her lord and ruler, because that in it there is found an unseemly thing; and bonds may be written out, as such are written, and a bill of divorcement be written and put into the hands of her who is cast out, so that she may no longer be familiar with her former guardian, when she is cast out from his dwelling.&#160; And even she who has gone away from her former dwelling may be joined to another husband, and be unfortunate with him, not only, as in the case of the former, not finding favour in his sight because an unseemly thing was found in her, but even being hated by him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6209"></A><A HREF="#fn_6209"><FONT SIZE="1">6210</FONT></A>
&#160; Yea, and even there might be written out from the second husband a bill of divorcement and it might be put into her hands from the last husband who sends her away from his dwelling.&#160; But whether there can be such a change of the life of angels with men, as to amount, so far as concerns their relation to us, to their death, one may put the question rash though it be; but be that as it may, she also who has once fallen away from the former husband will not return again to him, for the former husband who sent her away will not be able to turn back and take her as wife to himself, after she was defiled.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6210"></A><A HREF="#fn_6210"><FONT SIZE="1">6211</FONT></A>
&#160; And if one should dare, using a Scripture which is in circulation in the church, but not acknowledged by all to be divine, to soften down a precept of this kind, the passage might be taken from The Shepherd, concerning some who as soon as they believe are put in subjection to Michael,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6211"></A><A HREF="#fn_6211"><FONT SIZE="1">6212</FONT></A>
 but falling away from him from love of pleasure, are put in subjection to the angel of luxury,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6212"></A><A HREF="#fn_6212"><FONT SIZE="1">6213</FONT></A>
 then to the angel of punishment,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6213"></A><A HREF="#fn_6213"><FONT SIZE="1">6214</FONT></A>
 and after this to the angel of repentance; for you observe that the wife or soul who has once been given to luxury no longer returns to the first ruler, but also besides suffering punishment, is put in subjection to one inferior to Michael; for the angel of penitence is inferior to him.&#160; We must therefore take heed lest there be found in us any unseemly thing, and we should not find favour in the eyes of our husband Christ, or of the angel who has been set over us.&#160; For if we do not take heed, perhaps we also shall receive the bill of divorcement, and either be bereft of our guardian, or go to another man.&#160; But I consider that it is not of good omen to receive, as it were, the marriage of an angel with our own soul.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6214"></A><A HREF="#fn_6214"><FONT SIZE="1">6215</FONT></A>
