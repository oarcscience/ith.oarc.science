<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xxii-p1.1"></span>22.  The Marriage of Church
Dignitaries.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xxii-p2"></span>But, while dealing with the
passage, I would say that we will be able perhaps now to understand and
clearly set forth a question which is hard to grasp and see into, with
regard to the legislation of the Apostle concerning ecclesiastical
matters; for Paul wishes no one of those of the church, who has attained
to any eminence beyond the many, as is attained in the administration of
the sacraments, to make trial of a second marriage.  For laying down the
law in regard to bishops in the first Epistle to Timothy, he says, “If a
man seeketh the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.  The
bishop, therefore, must be without reproach, the husbands of one wife,
temperate, sober-minded,” <span id="fr_6215"></span>[6216](#fn_6215.md)
etc.; and, in regard to deacons, “Let the deacons,” he says, “be the
husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses
well,” <span id="fr_6216"></span>[6217](#fn_6216.md) etc.  Yea, and also
when appointing widows, he says, “Let there be no one as a widow under
threescore years old, having been the wife of one man;” <span
id="fr_6217"></span>[6218](#fn_6217.md) and after this he says the things
superadded, as being second or third in importance to this.  And, in the
Epistle to Titus, “For this cause,” he says, “I left thee in Crete that
thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint
elders <span id="page_510">p. 510</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xxii-Page_510"></span>in every city as I gave thee
charge.  If any one is blameless, the husband of one wife, having
children, that believe” <span id="fr_6218"></span>[6219](#fn_6218.md) —of
course—and so on.  Now, when we saw that some who have been married
twice may be much better than those who have been married once, we were
perplexed why Paul does not at all permit those who have been twice
married to be appointed to ecclesiastical dignities; for also it seemed
to me that such a thing was worthy of examination, as it was possible
that a man, who had been unfortunate in two marriages, and had lost his
second wife while he was yet young, might have lived for the rest of his
years up to old age in the greatest self-control and chastity.  Who,
then, would not naturally be perplexed why at all, when a ruler of the
church is being sought for, we do not appoint such a man, though he has
been twice married, because of the expressions about marriage, but lay
hold of the man who has been once married as our ruler, even if he
chance to have lived to old age with his wife, and sometimes may not
have been disciplined in chastity and temperance?  But, from what is
said in the law about the bill of divorcement, I reflect whether, seeing
that the bishop and the presbyter and the deacon are a symbol of things
that truly exist in accordance with these names, he wished to appoint
those who were figuratively once married, in order that he who is able
to give attention to the matter, may find out from the spiritual law the
one who was unworthy of ecclesiastical rule, whose soul did not find
favour in the eyes of her husband because there had been found in her an
unseemly thing, and she had become worthy of the bill of divorcement;
for such a soul, having dwelt along with a second husband, and having
been hated by such an one, can no longer, after the second bill of
divorcement, return to her former husband. <span
id="fr_6219"></span>[6220](#fn_6219.md)   It is likely, therefore, also,
that other arguments will be found by those who are wiser than we, and
have more ability to see into such things, whether in the law about the
bill of divorcement, or in the apostolic writings which prohibit those
who have been twice married from ruling over the church or being
preferred to preside over it.  But, until something shall be found that
is better and able by the excessive brilliancy of the light of knowledge
to cast into the shade what we have uttered, we have said the things
which have occurred to us in regard to the passages.
