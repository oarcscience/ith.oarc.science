<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxi-p1.1"></span>21.  The Rebuke of Peter and the Answer of
Jesus.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxi-p2"></span>“*And Peter took Him and began to
rebuke Him, saying, God be propitious to Thee.  Lord, this shall never
be unto thee.*” <span id="fr_5693"></span>[5694](#fn_5693.md)   To whom He
said, “*Get thee behind Me, Satan; thou art a stumbling-block unto Me;
for thou mindest not the things of God but the things of men.*” <span
id="fr_5694"></span>[5695](#fn_5694.md)   Since Jesus had begun to show
unto His disciples that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many
things, Peter up to this point learned the beginnings of those things
which were shown. <span id="fr_5695"></span>[5696](#fn_5695.md)   But since
he thought that the sufferings were unworthy of Christ the Son of the
living God, and below the dignity of the Father who had revealed to him
so great things about Christ,—for the things that concerned His coming
suffering had not been revealed to him,—on this account he took Him, and
as one forgetful of the honour due to the Christ, and that the Son of
the living God neither does nor says anything worthy of rebuke, he began
to rebuke Him; and as to one who needed propitiation,—for he did not yet
know that “God had set Him forth to be a propitiation through faith in
His blood,” <span id="fr_5696"></span>[5697](#fn_5696.md) he said, “God be
propitious to thee, O Lord.” <span id="fr_5697"></span>[5698](#fn_5697.md)
  Approving his purpose, indeed, but rebuking his ignorance, because of
the purpose being right, He says to him, “Get thee behind Me,” <span
id="fr_5698"></span>[5699](#fn_5698.md) as to one who, by reason of the
things of which he was ignorant and spake not rightly, had abandoned the
following of Jesus; but because of his ignorance, as to one who had
something antagonistic to the things of God, He said, “Satan,” which in
the Hebrew means “adversary.”  But, if Peter had not spoken from
ignorance, nor rebuked the Son of the living God, saying unto Him, “God
be propitious to thee, Lord, this shall never be unto Thee,” Christ
would not have said to him, “Get thee behind Me,” as to one who had
given up being behind Him and following Him; nor would He have said as
to one who had spoken things adverse to what He had said, “Satan.”  But
now Satan prevailed over him who had followed Jesus and was going behind
Him, to turn aside from following Him and from being behind the Son of
God, and to make him, by reason of the words which he spoke in
ignorance, worthy <span id="page_463">p. 463</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxi-Page_463"></span>of being called “Satan” and a
stumbling-block to the Son of God, and “as not minding the things of God
but the things of men.”  But that Peter was formerly behind the Son of
God, before he committed this sin, is manifest from the words, “Come ye
behind Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” <span
