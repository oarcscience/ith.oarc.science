<span id="xvi.ii.vi.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>8.  Jesus’ Prediction of His “Delivery”
Into the Hands of Men.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.viii-p2"></span>“*And while they abode in Galilee,
Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be delivered into the hands
of men.*” <span id="fr_5879"></span>[5880](#fn_5879.md)   And these things
will appear to be of the same effect as those, “that Jesus began to show
unto His disciples that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many
things of the elders and chief priests and scribes.” <span
id="fr_5880"></span>[5881](#fn_5880.md)   But it is not so; for it is not
the same thing “to show unto the disciples that He must go unto
Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and
scribes,” and, after suffering, “be killed,” and, after being killed,
“be raised up on the third day,” as that which was said to them, when
they were in Galilee,—which we did not learn before,—that the Son of man
“would be delivered up;” for the being delivered up was not mentioned
above, but now also it is said that “He is to be delivered up into the
hands of men.” <span id="fr_5881"></span>[5882](#fn_5881.md)   As for these
matters let us inquire by what person or persons He will be delivered up
into the hands of men; for there we are taught of whom He will suffer,
and in what place He will suffer; but here, in addition, we learn that
while His suffering many things takes place at the hands of the
aforesaid, they are not the prime causes of His suffering many things,
but the one or ones who delivered Him up into the hands of men.  For
some one will say that the Apostle, interpreting this, says with
reference to God, “He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up
for us all;” <span id="fr_5882"></span>[5883](#fn_5882.md) but the Son also
gave Himself to death for us, so that He was delivered up, not only by
the Father but also by Himself.  But another will say not merely that,
but also collecting <span id="page_480">p. 480</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vi.viii-Page_480"></span>the passages together, will say that
the Son is first delivered up by God,—then about to be tempted, then to
be in conflict, then to suffer for men, or even for the whole world that
He might take away its sin, <span id="fr_5883"></span>[5884](#fn_5883.md)
—to the prince of this age, and to the rest of its princes, and then by
them delivered into the hands of men who would slay Him.  The case of
Job will be taken as an illustration.  “Lo, all that is his I give into
thy hands, but do not touch him;” <span
id="fr_5884"></span>[5885](#fn_5884.md) thereafter, he was, as it were,
delivered up by the devil to his princes, namely, to those who took
prisoners of war, to the horsemen, to the fire that came down from
heaven, to the great wind that came from the desert and broke up his
house. <span id="fr_5885"></span>[5886](#fn_5885.md)   But you will
consider if, as he delivered up the property of Job to those who took
them captive, and to the horsemen, so also he delivered them up to a
certain power, subordinate to “the prince of the power of the air, of
the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience,” <span
id="fr_5886"></span>[5887](#fn_5886.md) in order that the fire which
descended thence on the sheep of Job might seem to fall from heaven, to
the man who announced to Job that “fire fell from heaven, and burned up
his sheep, and consumed the shepherds likewise.” <span
id="fr_5887"></span>[5888](#fn_5887.md)   And in the same way you will
inquire whether also the sudden mighty wind, that came down from the
desert and assailed the four corners of the dwelling, was one of those
which are under the devils to whom the devil delivered up the banquet of
the sons and daughters of Job, that the house might fall on the children
of the just man, and they might die.  Let it be granted, then, that, as
in the case of Job, the Father first delivered up the Son to the
opposing powers, and that then they delivered Him up into the hands of
men, among which men Judas also was, into whom after the sop <span
id="fr_5888"></span>[5889](#fn_5888.md) Satan entered, who delivered Him up
in a more authoritative manner than Judas.  But take care lest on
comparing together the delivering up of the Son by the Father to the
opposing powers, with the delivering up of the Saviour by them into the
hands of men, you should think that what is called the delivering up is
the same in the case of both.  For understand that the Father in His
love of men delivered Him up for us all; but the opposing powers, when
they delivered up the Saviour into the hands of men, did not intend to
deliver Him up for the salvation of some, but, as far as in them lay,
since none of them knew “the wisdom of God which was hidden in a
mystery,” <span id="fr_5889"></span>[5890](#fn_5889.md) they gave Him up to
be put to death, that His enemy death might receive Him under its
subjection, like those who die in Adam; <span
id="fr_5890"></span>[5891](#fn_5890.md) and also the men who slew Him did
so, as they were moulded after the will of those who wished indeed that
Jesus should become subject to death.  I have deemed it necessary also
to examine into these things, because that when Jesus was delivered up
into the hands of men, He was not delivered up by men into the hands of
men, but by powers to whom the Father delivered up His Son for us all,
and in the very act of His being delivered up, and coming under the
power of those to whom He was delivered up, destroying him that has the
power of death; for “through death He brought to nought him that hath
the power of death, that is, the devil, and delivered all them who
through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.” <span
