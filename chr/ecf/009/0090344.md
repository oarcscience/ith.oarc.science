<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.xxix-p1.1"></span>29.  About What Beings Jesus Needed
Testimony.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxix-p2"></span>The words, “He needed not that any
should testify of man,” may fitly be used to show that the Son of God is
able of Himself to see the truth about each man and is in no need of
such testimony as any other could supply.  The words, however, “He had
no need that any should testify of man,” are not equivalent to “He had
no need of testimony about any being.”  If we take the word “man” to
include every being who is according to the image of God, or every
reasonable creature, then He will have no need that any should testify
to Him of any reasonable being whatever, since He Himself, by the power
given Him by the Father, knows them all.  But if the term “man” be
restricted to mortal animated reasonable beings, then it might be said,
on the one hand, that He had need of testimony respecting the beings
above man, and while His knowledge was adequate with regard to man it
did not extend to those other beings.  On the other hand, however, it
might be said that He who humbled Himself had no need that any should
testify to Him concerning man, but that He had such need in respect of
beings higher than men.
