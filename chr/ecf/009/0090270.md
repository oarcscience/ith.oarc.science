id="xv.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Fragments of the Fourth Book. <span

<span id="xv.iii.iii-p3"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.iii-p3.1"></span>(*Three Leaves from the Beginning*.)</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iii-p4"></span>1.  He who distinguishes in himself
voice and meaning and things for which the meaning stands, will not be
offended at rudeness of language if, on enquiry, he finds the things
spoken of to be sound.  The more may this be so when we remember how the
holy men acknowledge their speech and their preaching to be not in
persuasion of the wisdom of words, but in demonstration of the Spirit
and of power.…

<span id="xv.iii.iii-p5"></span>\[*Then, after speaking of the rudeness
of style of the Gospel, he proceeds*: \]

<span id="xv.iii.iii-p6"></span>2.  The Apostles are not unaware that in
some things they give offence, and that in some respects their culture
is defective, and they confess themselves <span
id="fr_4776"></span>[4777](#fn_4776.md) accordingly to be rude in speech
but not in knowledge; for we must consider that the other Apostles would
have said this, too, as well as Paul.  As for the text, <span
id="fr_4777"></span>[4778](#fn_4777.md) “But we have this treasure in
earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not
of us,” we interpret it in this way.  By “treasures” we understand here,
as in other passages, the treasure of knowledge (gnosis) and of hidden
wisdom.  By “earthen vessels” we understand the humble diction of the
Scriptures, which the Greek might so readily be led to despise, and in
which the excellency of God’s power appears so clearly.  The mystery of
the truth and the power of the things said were not hindered by the
humble diction from travelling to the ends of the earth, nor from
subduing to the word of Christ, not only the foolish things of the
world, but sometimes its wise things, too.  For we see our
calling, <span id="fr_4778"></span>[4779](#fn_4778.md) not that no wise man
according to the flesh, but that not many wise according to the flesh. 
But Paul, in his preaching of the Gospel, is a debtor <span
id="fr_4779"></span>[4780](#fn_4779.md) to deliver the word not to
Barbarians only, but also to Greeks, and not only to the unwise, who
would easily agree with him, but also to the wise.  For he was made
sufficient <span id="fr_4780"></span>[4781](#fn_4780.md) by God to be a
minister of the New Covenant, wielding the demonstration of the spirit
and of power, so that when the believers agreed with him their belief
should <span id="page_346">p. 346</span> <span
id="xv.iii.iii-Page_346"></span>not be in the wisdom of men, but in the
power of God.  For, perhaps, if the Scripture possessed, like the works
the Greeks admire, elegance and command of diction, then it would be
open to suppose that not the truth of them had laid hold of men, but
that the apparent sequence and splendour of language had carried off the
hearers, and had carried them off by guile.
