<span id="xv.iii.ii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>23.  There is a Divine Darkness Which
is Not Evil, and Which Ultimately Becomes Light.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xxiii-p2"></span>In connection with this subject it
is necessary for us to point out that darkness is not to be understood,
every time it is mentioned, in a bad sense; Scripture speaks of it
sometimes in a good sense.  The heterodox have failed to observe this
distinction, and have accordingly adopted most shameful doctrines about
the Maker of the world, and have indeed revolted from Him, and addicted
themselves to fictions and myths.  We must, therefore, show how and when
the name of darkness is taken in a good sense.  Darkness and clouds and
tempest are said in Exodus <span id="fr_4743"></span>[4744](#fn_4743) to
be round about God, and in the seventeenth Psalm, <span
id="fr_4744"></span>[4745](#fn_4744) “He made darkness His secret place,
His tent round about Him, dark water in clouds of the air.”  Indeed, if
one considers the multitude of speculation and knowledge about God,
beyond the power of human nature to take in, beyond the power, perhaps,
of all originated beings except Christ and the Holy Spirit, then one may
know how God is surrounded with darkness, because the discourse is hid
in ignorance which would be required to tell in what darkness He has
made His hiding-place when He arranged that the things concerning Him
should be unknown and beyond the grasp of knowledge.  Should any one be
staggered by these expositions, he may be reconciled to them both by the
“dark sayings” and by the “treasures of darkness,” hidden, invisible,
which are given to Christ by God.  In nowise different, I consider, are
the treasures of darkness which are hid in Christ, from what is spoken
of in the text, “God made darkness His secret place,” and (the saint)
“shall understand parable and dark saying.” <span
id="fr_4745"></span>[4746](#fn_4745)   And consider if we have here the
reason of the Saviour’s saying to His disciples, “What ye have heard in
darkness, speak ye in the light.”  The mysteries committed to them in
secret and where few could hear, hard to be known and obscure, He bids
them, when enlightened and therefore said to be in the light, to make
known to every one who is made light.  I might add a still stranger
feature of this darkness which is praised, namely, that it hastens to
the light and overtakes it, and so at last, after having been unknown as
darkness, undergoes for him who does not see its power such a change
that he comes to know it and to declare that what was formerly known to
him as darkness has now become light.
