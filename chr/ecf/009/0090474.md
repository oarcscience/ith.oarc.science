<span id="xvi.ii.vii.i-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.i-p1.1"></span>Book XIV.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.i-p2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.i-p2.1"></span>1.  The Power of Harmony in Relation to
Prayer.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.i-p3"></span>“*Again I say unto you that if two of
you shall agree* <span id="fr_6036"></span>[6037](#fn_6036) *on earth as
touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for
them.*” <span id="fr_6037"></span>[6038](#fn_6037)   The word symphony
is strictly applied to the harmonies of sounds in music.  And there are
indeed among musical sounds some accordant and others discordant.  But
the Evangelic Scripture is familiar with the name as applied to musical
matters in the passage, “He heard a symphony and dancing.” <span
id="fr_6038"></span>[6039](#fn_6038)   For it was fitting that when the
son who had been lost and found came by penitence into concord with his
father a symphony should be heard on the occasion of the joyous mirth of
the house.  But the wicked Laban was not acquainted with the word
symphony in his saying to Jacob, “And if thou hadst told me I would have
sent thee away with mirth and with music and with drums and a
harp.” <span id="fr_6039"></span>[6040](#fn_6039)   But akin to the
symphony of this nature is that which is written in the second Book of
Kings when “the brethren of Aminadab went before the ark, and David and
his son played before the Lord on instruments artistically fitted with
might and with songs;” <span id="fr_6040"></span>[6041](#fn_6040) for
the instruments thus fitted with might and with songs, had in themselves
the musical symphony which is so powerful that when two only, bring
along with the symphony which has relation to the music that is divine
and spiritual, a request to the Father in heaven about anything
whatsoever, the Father grants the request to those who ask along with
the symphony on earth,—which is most miraculous,—those things which
those who have made the symphony spoken of may have asked.  So also I
understand the apostolic saying “Defraud ye not one the other except it
be by agreement for a season that ye may give yourselves unto
prayer.” <span id="fr_6041"></span>[6042](#fn_6041)   For since the word
harmony is applied to those who marry according to God in the passage
from Proverbs which is as follows:  “Fathers will divide their house and
substance to their sons, but from God the woman is married to the
man,” <span id="fr_6042"></span>[6043](#fn_6042) it is a logical
consequence of the harmony being from God, that the name and the deed
should enjoy the agreement with a view to prayer, as is indicated in the
word, “unless it be by agreement.” <span
id="fr_6043"></span>[6044](#fn_6043)   Then the Word repeating that the
agreeing of two on the earth is the same thing as the agreeing with
Christ, adds, “For where two or three are gathered together in My
name.” <span id="fr_6044"></span>[6045](#fn_6044)   Therefore the two or
three who are gathered together in the name of Christ are those who are
in agreement on earth, not two only <span id="page_495">p. 495</span>
<span id="xvi.ii.vii.i-Page_495"></span>but sometimes also three.  But
he who has the power will consider whether this agreement and a
congregation of this sort in the midst of which Christ is, can be found
in more, since “narrow and straightened is the way that leadeth unto
life, and few be they that find it.” <span
id="fr_6045"></span>[6046](#fn_6045)   But perhaps also not even few but
two or three make a symphony as Peter and James and John, to whom as
making a symphony the Word of God showed His own glory.  But two made a
symphony, Paul and Sosthenes, when writing the first Epistle to the
Corinthians; <span id="fr_6046"></span>[6047](#fn_6046) and after this
Paul and Timothy when sending the second Epistle to the same. <span
id="fr_6047"></span>[6048](#fn_6047)   And even three made a symphony
when Paul and Silvanus and Timothy gave instruction by letter to the
Thessalonians. <span id="fr_6048"></span>[6049](#fn_6048)   But if it be
necessary also from the ancient Scriptures to bring forward the three
who made a symphony on earth, so that the Word was in the midst of them
making them one, attend to the superscription of the Psalms, as for
example to that of the forty-first, which is as follows:  “Unto the end,
unto understanding, for the sons of Korah.” <span
id="fr_6049"></span>[6050](#fn_6049)   For though there were three sons
of Korah whose names we find in the Book of Exodus, <span
id="fr_6050"></span>[6051](#fn_6050) Aser, which is, by interpretation,
“instruction,” and the second Elkana, which is translated, “possession
of God,” and the third Abiasaph, which in the Greek tongue might be
rendered, “congregation of the father,” yet the prophecies were not
divided but were both spoken and written by one spirit, and one voice,
and one soul, which wrought with true harmony, and the three speak as
one, “As the heart panteth after the springs of the water, so panteth my
soul after thee, O God.” <span id="fr_6051"></span>[6052](#fn_6051)  
But also they say in the plural in the forty-fourth Psalm, “O God, we
have heard with our ears.” <span id="fr_6052"></span>[6053](#fn_6052)  
But if you wish still further to see those who are making symphony on
earth look to those who heard the exhortation, “that ye may be perfected
together in the same mind and in the same judgment,” <span
id="fr_6053"></span>[6054](#fn_6053) and who strove after the goal, “the
soul and the heart of all the believers were one,” <span
id="fr_6054"></span>[6055](#fn_6054) who have become such, if it be
possible for such a condition to be found in more than two or three,
that there is no discord between them, just as there is no discord
between the strings of the ten-stringed psaltery with each other.  But
they were not in symphony in earth who said, “I am of Paul, and I of
Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ,” <span
id="fr_6055"></span>[6056](#fn_6055) but there were schisms among them,
upon the dissolution of which they were gathered together in company
with the spirit in Paul, with the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, <span
id="fr_6056"></span>[6057](#fn_6056) that they might no longer “bite and
devour one another so that they were consumed by one another;” <span
id="fr_6057"></span>[6058](#fn_6057) for discord consumes, as concord
brings together, and admits <span id="fr_6058"></span>[6059](#fn_6058)
the Son of God who comes in the midst of those who have become at
concord.  And strictly, indeed, concord takes place in two things
generic, through the perfecting together, as the Apostle has called it,
of the same mind by an intellectual grasp of the same opinions, and
through the perfecting together of the same judgment, by a like way of
living.  But if whenever two of us agree on earth as touching anything
that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of the Father of Jesus
who is in heaven, <span id="fr_6059"></span>[6060](#fn_6059) plainly
when this is not done for them of the Father in heaven as touching
anything that they shall ask, there the two have not been in agreement
on earth; and this is the cause why we are not heard when we pray, that
we do not agree with one another on earth, neither in opinions nor in
life.  But further also if we are the body of Christ and God hath set
the members each one of them in the body that the members may have the
same care one for another, and may agree with one another, and when one
member suffers, all the members suffer with it, and if one be glorified,
they rejoice with it, <span id="fr_6060"></span>[6061](#fn_6060) we
ought to practise the symphony which springs from the divine music, that
when we are gathered together in the name of Christ, He may be in the
midst of us, the Word of God, and the Wisdom of God, and His
Power. <span id="fr_6061"></span>[6062](#fn_6061)
