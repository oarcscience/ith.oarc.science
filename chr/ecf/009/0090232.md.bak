<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>36.  Christ as a Sword.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxvi-p2"></span>The texts of the New Testament,
which we have discussed, are things said by Himself about Himself. 
Isaiah, however, He said <span id="fr_4620"></span>[4621](#fn_4620.md) that
His mouth had been set by His Father as a sharp sword, and that He was
hidden under the shadow of His hand, made like to a chosen shaft and
kept close in the Father’s quiver, called His servant by the God of all
things, and Israel, and Light of the Gentiles.  The mouth of the Son of
God is a sharp sword, for <span id="fr_4621"></span>[4622](#fn_4621.md)
“The word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged
sword, and piercing to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints
and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the
heart.”  And indeed He came not to bring peace on the earth, that is, to
corporeal and sensible things, but a sword, and to cut through, if I may
say so, the disastrous friendship of soul and body, so that the soul,
committing herself to the spirit which was against the flesh, may enter
into friendship with God.  Hence, according to the prophetic word, He
made His mouth as a sword, as a sharp sword.  Can any one behold so many
wounded by the divine love, like her in the Song of Songs, who
complained that she was wounded: <span
id="fr_4622"></span>[4623](#fn_4622.md)   “I am wounded with love,” and
find the dart that wounded so many souls for the love of God, in any but
Him who said, “He hath made Me as a chosen shaft.”
