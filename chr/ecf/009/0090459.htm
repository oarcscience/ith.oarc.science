<p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.xviii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.xviii-p1.1"></A>18.&#160; Who Was the Little Child Called by Jesus.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.xviii-p2"></A>Now another interpretation different from what is called the simpler may be uttered; whether as dogma, or for the sake of exercise, so to speak, let us also inquire what was the little child who was called by Jesus and set in the midst of the disciples.&#160; Now consider if you can say that the little child, whom Jesus called, was the Holy Spirit who humbled Himself, when He was called by the Saviour, and set in the midst of the reason of the disciples of Jesus; if, indeed, He wishes us, being turned away from everything else, to be turned towards the examples suggested by the Holy Spirit, so that we may so become as the little children, who are themselves also turned and likened to the Holy Spirit; which little children God gave to the Saviour, according to what is said in Isaiah, &#8220;Behold, I and the little children which God has given to me.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5934"></A><A HREF="#fn_5934"><FONT SIZE="1">5935</FONT></A>
&#160; And it is not possible for any one to enter into the kingdom of heaven, who has not been turned away from the affairs of this world, and made like unto the little children who possess the Holy Spirit; which Holy Spirit was called by Jesus, and, descending from His own perfection to men as a little child, was set by Jesus in the midst of the disciples.&#160; It is necessary, then, for him who has turned away from the desires of this world to humble himself not simply as the little child, but, according to what is written, <A NAME="page_486"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 486</FONT></A> <a name="xvi.ii.vi.xviii-Page_486"></A>&#8220;as this little child.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5935"></A><A HREF="#fn_5935"><FONT SIZE="1">5936</FONT></A>
&#160; But to humble oneself as that little child is to imitate the Holy Spirit, who humbled Himself for the salvation of men.&#160; Now, that the Saviour and the Holy Spirit were sent by the Father for the salvation of men has been declared in Isaiah, in the person of the Saviour, saying, &#8220;And now the Lord hath sent me and His Spirit.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5936"></A><A HREF="#fn_5936"><FONT SIZE="1">5937</FONT></A>
&#160; You must know, however, that this expression is ambiguous; for either God sent, but also the Holy Spirit sent, the Saviour; or, as we have taken it, the Father sent both&#8212;the Saviour and the Holy Spirit.&#160; He, therefore, who has humbled himself more than all those who have humbled themselves in imitation of that little child, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.&#160; For there are many who are willing to humble themselves as that little child; but the man, who in every respect has become like to the little child who humbled himself, in the name of Jesus&#8212;especially in Jesus Himself,&#8212;in reality, would be found to be he who is named greater than all in the kingdom of heaven.&#160; But as he receives Jesus, whosoever receives one such of the little children in His name, so he rejects Jesus and casts Him out, who does not wish to receive one such little child in the name of Jesus.&#160; But if, also, there is a difference in those who are deemed worthy of the Holy Spirit, as believers receive more or less of the Holy Spirit, there would be some little ones among those who believe in God who can be made to stumble:&#160; to avenge whose being made to stumble the Word says, with reference to those who had caused them to stumble, &#8220;It is profitable for him that an ass&#146;s millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5937"></A><A HREF="#fn_5937"><FONT SIZE="1">5938</FONT></A>
&#160; Let these things be said in regard to the passage of Matthew before us.</p>
