Special Messengers.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.lxiii-p2"></span>Right is it, therefore, to approach
examples so good and so many, and submit the neck and fulfil the part of
obedience, in order that, undisturbed by vain sedition, we may attain
unto the goal set before us in truth wholly free from blame.  Joy and
gladness will ye afford us, if ye become obedient to the words written
by us and through the Holy Spirit root out the lawless wrath of your
jealousy according to the intercession which we have made for peace and
unity in this letter.  We have sent men faithful and discreet, whose
conversation from youth to old age has been blameless amongst us,—the
same shall be witnesses between you and us.  This we have done, that ye
may know that our whole concern has been and is that ye may be speedily
at peace.
