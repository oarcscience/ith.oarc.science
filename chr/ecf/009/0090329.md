<span id="xv.iii.vi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>14.  In the First Three Gospels the
Passover is Spoken of Only at the Close of the Ministry; In John at the
Beginning.  Remarks on This.  Heracleon on the Passover.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.xiv-p2"></span>We must not, however, fail to enquire
into the statement that the passover of the Jews was at hand, when the
Lord was at Capernaum with His mother and His brothers and His
disciples.  In the Gospel according to Matthew, <span
id="fr_5044"></span>[5045](#fn_5044) after being left by the devil, and
after the angels came and ministered to Him, when He heard that John was
delivered up He withdrew into Galilee, and leaving Nazara He came and
dwelt in Capernaum.  Then He began to preach, and chose the four
fishermen for His Apostles, and taught in the synagogues of the whole of
Galilee and healed those who were brought to Him.  Then He goes up into
the mountain and speaks the beatitudes and what follows them; and after
finishing that instruction He comes down from the mountain and enters
Capernaum a second time. <span id="fr_5045"></span>[5046](#fn_5045)  
Then He embarked in a ship and crossed over to the other side to the
country of the Gergesenes.  On their beseeching Him to depart out of
their coasts He embarked <span id="fr_5046"></span>[5047](#fn_5046) in a
ship and crossed over and came to His own city.  Then He wrought certain
cures and went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their
synagogues; after this most of the events of the Gospels take place,
before Matthew indicates the approach of the time of passover. <span
id="fr_5047"></span>[5048](#fn_5047)   With the other Evangelists also,
after the stay at Capernaum it is long till we come to any mention of
the passover; which may confirm in their opinion those who take the view
about Capernaum which was set forth above.  That stay, in the
neighbourhood of the passover of the Jews, is set in a brighter light by
that nearness, both because it was better in itself, and still more
because at the passover of the Jews there are found in the temple those
who sell oxen and sheep and doves.  This adds emphasis to the statement
that the passover was not that of the Lord but that of the Jews; the
Father’s house was made, in the eyes of those who did not hallow it, a
house of merchandise, and the passover of the Lord became for those who
took a low and material view of it a Jewish passover.  A fitter occasion
than the present will occur for enquiring as to the time of the
passover, which took place about the spring equinox, and for any other
enquiry which may arise in connection with it.  As for Heracleon, he
says, “This is the great festival; for it was a type of the passion of
the Saviour; not only was the lamb put to death, the eating of it
afforded relaxation, the killing it pointed to what of the passion of
the Saviour was in this world, and the eating it to the rest at the
marriage.”  We have given his words, that it may be seen with what a
want of caution and how loosely he proceeds, and with what an absence of
constructive skill even on such a theme as this; and how little regard
in consequence is to be paid to him.
