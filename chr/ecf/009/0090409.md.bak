<span id="xvi.ii.v.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xii-p1.1"></span>12.  Every Sin—Every False Doctrine is a
“Gate of Hades.”</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xii-p2"></span>But when we have understood how each
of the sins through which there is a way to Hades <span
id="fr_5633"></span>[5634](#fn_5633.md) is a gate of Hades, we shall
apprehend that the soul, which has “spot or wrinkle or any such
thing,” <span id="fr_5634"></span>[5635](#fn_5634.md) and because of
wickedness is neither holy nor blameless, is neither a rock upon which
Christ builds, nor a church, nor part of a church which Christ builds
upon the rock.  But if any one wishes to put us <span
id="fr_5635"></span>[5636](#fn_5635.md) to shame in regard to these things
because of the great majority of those of the church who are thought to
believe, it must be said to him not only “Many are called, but few
chosen;” <span id="fr_5636"></span>[5637](#fn_5636.md) but also that which
was said by the Saviour to those who come to Him, as it is recorded in
Luke in these words, “Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I
say unto you, shall seek to enter in through the narrow door and shall
not be able;” <span id="fr_5637"></span>[5638](#fn_5637.md) and also that
which is written in the Gospel of Matthew thus, “For narrow is the gate,
and strait is the way that leadeth unto life, and few be they that find
it.” <span id="fr_5638"></span>[5639](#fn_5638.md)   Now, if you attend to
the saying, “Many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in and shall not
be able,” <span id="fr_5639"></span>[5640](#fn_5639.md) you will understand
that this refers to those who boast that they are of the church, but
live weakly and contrary to the word.  Of those, then, who seek to enter
in, those who are not able to enter will not be able to do so, because
the gates of Hades prevail against them; but in the case of those
against whom the gates of Hades will not prevail, those seeking to enter
in will be strong, being able to do all things, in Christ Jesus, who
strengtheneth them. <span id="fr_5640"></span>[5641](#fn_5640.md)   And in
like manner each one of those who are the authors of any evil opinion
has become the architect of a certain gate of Hades; but those who
co-operate with the teaching of the architect of such things are
servants and stewards, who are the bond-servants of the evil doctrine
which goes to build up impiety.  And though the gates of Hades are many
and almost innumerable, no gate of Hades will prevail against the rock
or against the church which Christ builds upon it.  Notwithstanding,
these gates have a certain power by which they gain the mastery over
some who do not resist and strive against them; but they are overcome by
others who, because they do not turn aside from Him who said, “I am the
door,” <span id="fr_5641"></span>[5642](#fn_5641.md) have rased from their
soul all the gates of Hades.  And this also we must know that as the
gates of cities have each their own names, in the same way the gates of
Hades might be named after the species of sins; so that one gate of
Hades is called “fornication,” through which fornicators go, and another
“denial,” through which the deniers of God go down into Hades.  And
likewise already each of the heterodox and of those who have begotten
any “knowledge which is falsely so called,” <span
id="fr_5642"></span>[5643](#fn_5642.md) has built a gate of Hades—Marcion
one gate, and Basilides another, and Valentinus another.
