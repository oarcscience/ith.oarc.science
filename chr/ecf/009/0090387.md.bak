<span id="xvi.ii.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.x-p1.1"></span>10.  The Traditions of the Elders in
Collision with Divine Law.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.x-p2"></span>But let us return to the subject before
us, in which the Saviour abridged and expounded two commandments from
the law, the one from the decalogue from Exodus, and the other from
Leviticus, or the other from some one of the books of the Pentateuch. 
Then since we have explained in what way they made void the word of God
which said, “Honour thy father and thy mother,” by saying, “Thou shalt
not honour thy father or thy mother,” whosoever shall say to his father
or mother, “It is a gift that wherewith thou mightest have been profited
by me,” some one may inquire whether the words, “He that speaketh evil
of father or mother, let him die the death,” <span
id="fr_5421"></span>[5422](#fn_5421.md) are not extraneous.  For, granted
that he does not honour his father and mother, who consecrates to what
is called Corban that which would have been given in honour of father
and mother, in what way, therefore, does the tradition of the Pharisees
make void the word which said, “He that speaketh evil of father or
mother, let him die the death?”  But, perhaps, when any one said to his
father or his mother, “It is a gift, that wherewith thou mightest have
been profited by me,” <span id="fr_5422"></span>[5423](#fn_5422.md) he, as
it were, casts abuse on his father or mother as if he were calling his
parents sacrilegious, in taking that which was consecrated to Corban
from him who had consecrated it to Corban.  The Jews then punish their
sons <span id="fr_5423"></span>[5424](#fn_5423.md) according to the law, as
speaking evil of father or mother, when they say to their father or
mother, “It is a gift, that wherewith thou mightest have been profited
by me,” but you by one of your traditions make void two commandments of
God.  And then you are not ashamed to accuse My disciples who transgress
no commandment; for they walk “in all His commandments and ordinances
blamelessly,” <span id="fr_5424"></span>[5425](#fn_5424.md) but transgress
a tradition of the elders, so as not to transgress a commandment of
God.  And if you had held this aim before you, you would have kept the
commandment about the honour due to father and mother, and that which
said, “He that speaketh evil of father and mother, let him die the
death;” but the tradition of the elders which is opposed to these
commandments you would not have kept.
