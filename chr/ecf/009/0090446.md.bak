id="xvi.ii.vi.v-p1.1"></span>5.  The Deaf and Dumb Spirit.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.v-p2"></span>Now the father of the epileptic—perhaps
the angel to whom he had been allotted, if we are to say that every
human soul is put in subjection to some angel—prays the Physician of
souls for his son that He may heal him who could not be healed from his
disorder by the inferior word which was in the disciples.  But the dumb
and deaf spirit, who was cast out by the Word, must be figuratively
understood as the irrational impulses, even towards that which seems to
be good, so that, what things any man once did by irrational impulse
which seemed to onlookers to be good, he may do no longer irrationally
but according to the reason of the teaching of Jesus.  Under the
inspiration of this Paul also said, “If I have all faith so as to remove
mountains;” <span id="fr_5866"></span>[5867](#fn_5866.md) for he, who has
all faith, which is as a grain of mustard seed, <span
id="fr_5867"></span>[5868](#fn_5867.md) removes not one mountain only, but
also several analogous to it; for although faith is despised by men and
appears to be something very little and contemptible; yet when it meets
with good ground, that is the soul, which is able fittingly to receive
such seed, it becomes a great tree, so that no one of those things which
have no wings, but the birds of heaven which are winged spiritually, are
able to lodge in the branches of faith so great. <span
