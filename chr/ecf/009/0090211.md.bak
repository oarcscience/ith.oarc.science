<span id="xv.iii.i.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xv-p1.1"></span>15.  The Gospel is in the Old Testament,
and Indeed in the Whole Universe.  Prayer for Aid to Understand the
Mystical Sense of the Work in Hand.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xv-p2"></span>As, then, we have shown that the
beginning of the Gospel, according to one interpretation, is the whole
Old Testament, and is signified by the person of John, we shall add,
lest this should be called a mere unsupported assertion, what is said in
the Acts <span id="fr_4525"></span>[4526](#fn_4525.md) about the eunuch of
the queen of the Ethiopians and Philip.  Philip, it is said, began at
the passage of Isaiah:  “He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a
lamb before his shearer is dumb,” and so preached to him the Lord
Jesus.  How can he begin with the prophet and preach Jesus, if Isaiah
was not a part of the beginning of the Gospel?  From this we may derive
a proof of the assertion made at the outset, that every divine Scripture
is Gospel.  If he who preaches the Gospel preaches good things, and all
those who spoke before the sojourn of Jesus in the flesh preach Christ,
who is as we saw good things, then the words spoken by all of them alike
are in a sense a part of the Gospel.  And when the Gospel is said to be
declared throughout the whole world, we infer that it is actually
preached in the whole world, not, that is to say, in this earthly
district only, but in the whole system of heaven and earth, or from
heaven and earth.  And why should we discuss any further what the Gospel
is?  What we have said is enough.  Besides the passages we have adduced,
passages by no means inept or unsuited for our purpose,—much to the same
effect might be collected from the Scriptures, so that it is clearly
seen what is the glory of the good things in Jesus Christ shed forth by
the Gospel, the Gospel ministered by men and angels, and, I believe,
also by authorities and powers, <span
id="fr_4526"></span>[4527](#fn_4526.md) and thrones and dominions, and
every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in the world
to come, and indeed even by Christ Himself.  Here, then, let us bring to
a close what has to be said before proceeding to read the work itself. 
And now let us ask God to assist us through Jesus Christ by the Holy
Spirit, so that we may be able to unfold the mystical sense which is
treasured up in the words before us.
