<span id="xii.ii-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xii.ii-p3"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xii.ii-p3.1"></span>\[From Vol. I. of the Ante-Nicene
Fathers.\]</span>

<span id="xii.ii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xii.ii-p4.1"></span>The</span> first Epistle, bearing the name of
Clement, has been preserved to us in a single manuscript only.  Though
very frequently referred to by ancient Christian writers, it remained
unknown to the scholars of Western Europe until happily discovered in
the Alexandrian manuscript.  This <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.ii-p4.2"></span>ms.</span> of the sacred Scriptures (known and
generally referred to as Codex A) was presented in 1628 by Cyril,
Patriarch of Constantinople, to Charles I., and is now preserved in the
British Museum.  Subjoined to the books of the New Testament contained
in it, there are two writings described as the Epistles of one Clement. 
Of these, that now before us is the first.  It is tolerably perfect, but
there are many slight *lacunæ*, or gaps, in the <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.ii-p4.3"></span>ms.</span>, and one whole leaf is supposed to
have been lost towards the close.  These *lacunæ*, however, so numerous
in some chapters, do not generally extend beyond a word or syllable, and
can for the most part be easily supplied.

<span id="xii.ii-p5"></span>Who the Clement was to whom these writings
are ascribed, cannot with absolute certainty be determined.  The general
opinion is, that he is the same as the person of that name referred to
by St. Paul ([Phil. iv. 3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md)<span
id="xii.ii-p5.1"></span>).  The writings themselves contain no statement
as to their author.  The first, and by far the longer of them, simply
purports to have been written in the name of the church at Rome to the
church at Corinth.  But in the catalogue of contents prefixed to the
<span class="sc"><span id="xii.ii-p5.2"></span>ms.</span> they are both
plainly attributed to one Clement; and the judgment of most scholars is,
that, in regard to the first epistle at least, this statement is
correct, and that it is to be regarded as an authentic production of the
friend and fellow worker of St. Paul.  This belief may be traced to an
early period in the history of the church.  It is found in the writings
of Eusebius (*Hist. Eccl*., iii. 15), of Origen (*Comm. in Joan*., i.
29), and others.  The internal evidence also tends to support this
opinion.  The doctrine, style, and manner of thought are all in
accordance with it; so that, although, as has been said, positive
certainty cannot be reached on the subject, we may with great
probability conclude that we have in this epistle a composition of that
Clement who is known to us from Scripture as having been an associate of
the great apostle.

<span id="xii.ii-p6"></span>The date of this epistle has been the
subject of considerable controversy.  It is clear from the writing
itself that it was composed soon after some persecution (chap. i.) which
the Roman church had endured; and the only question is, whether we are
to fix upon the persecution under Nero or Domitian.  If the former, the
date will be about the year 68; if the latter, we must place it towards
the close of the first century or the beginning of the second.  We
possess no external aid to the settlement of this question.  The lists
of early Roman bishops are in hopeless confusion, some making Clement
the immediate successor of St. Peter, others placing Linus, and others
still Linus and Anacletus, between him and the apostle.  The internal
evidence, again, leaves the matter doubtful, though it has been strongly
pressed on both sides.  The probability seems, on the whole, to be in
favour of the Domitian period, so that the epistle may be dated about
<span class="sc"><span id="xii.ii-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 97.

<span id="xii.ii-p7"></span>This epistle was held in very great esteem
by the early church.  The account given of it by Eusebius (*Hist.
Eccl*., iii. 16) is as follows:  “There is one acknowledged epistle of
this Clement (whom he has just identified with the friend of St. Paul),
great and admirable, which he wrote in the name of the church of Rome to
the church at Corinth, sedition having then arisen in the latter
church.  We are aware that this epistle has been publicly read in very
many churches, both in old times and also in our own day.”  The epistle
before us thus appears to have been read in numerous churches, as being
almost on a level with the canonical writings.  And its place in the
Alexandrian <span class="sc"><span id="xii.ii-p7.1"></span>ms.</span>,
immediately after the inspired books, is in harmony with the position
thus assigned it in the primitive church.  There does indeed appear a
great difference between it and the inspired writings in many respects,
<span id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span id="xii.ii-Page_228"></span>such
as the fanciful use sometimes made of Old Testament statements, the
fabulous stories which are accepted by its author, and the general
diffuseness and feebleness of style by which it is distinguished.  But
the high tone of evangelical truth which pervades it, the simple and
earnest appeals which it makes to the heart and conscience, and the
anxiety which its writer so constantly shows to promote the best
interests of the church of Christ, still impart an undying charm to this
precious relic of later apostolic times.
