<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>15.  Eating with Unwashed Heart Defiles
the Man.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xv-p2"></span>Next to this let us see how the things
which proceed out and defile the man do not defile the man because of
their proceeding out of the mouth, but have the cause of their
defilement in the heart, when there come forth out of it, before those
things which proceed through the mouth, evil thoughts, of which the
species are—murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness,
railings. <span id="fr_5478"></span>[5479](#fn_5478.md)   For these are the
things which defile the man, when they come forth out of the heart, and
going out from it proceed through the mouth; so that, if they did not
come out of the heart, but were retained there somewhere about the
heart, and were not allowed to be spoken through the mouth, <span
id="page_444">p. 444</span> <span id="xvi.ii.iv.xv-Page_444"></span>they
would very quickly disappear, and a man would be no more defiled.  The
spring and source, then, of every sin are evil thoughts; for, unless
these gained the mastery, neither murders nor adulteries nor any other
such thing would exist.  Therefore, each man must keep his own heart
with all watchfulness; <span id="fr_5479"></span>[5480](#fn_5479.md) for
when the Lord comes in the day of judgment, “He will bring to light the
hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the
hearts,” <span id="fr_5480"></span>[5481](#fn_5480.md) “all the thoughts of
men meanwhile accusing or else excusing them,” <span
id="fr_5481"></span>[5482](#fn_5481.md) “when their own devices have beset
them about.” <span id="fr_5482"></span>[5483](#fn_5482.md)   But of such a
nature are the evil thoughts that sometimes they make worthy of censure
even those things which seem good, and which, so far as the judgment of
the masses is concerned, are worthy of praise.  Accordingly, if we do
alms before men, having in our thoughts the design of appearing to men
philanthropic, and of being honoured because of philanthropy, we receive
the reward from men; <span id="fr_5483"></span>[5484](#fn_5483.md) and,
universally, everything that is done with the consciousness in the doer
that he will be glorified by men, has no reward from Him who beholds in
secret, and renders the reward to those who are pure, in secret.  So,
too, therefore, is it with apparent purity if it is influenced by
considerations of vain glory or love of gain; and the teaching which is
thought to be the teaching of the Church, if it becomes servile through
the word of flattery, either when it is made the excuse for
covetousness, or when any one seeks glory from men because of his
teaching, is not reckoned to be the teaching of those “who have been set
by God in the Church:  first, apostles; secondly, prophets; and thirdly,
teachers.” <span id="fr_5484"></span>[5485](#fn_5484.md)   And you will say
the like in the case of him who seeks the office of a bishop for the
sake of glory with men, or of flattery from men, or for the sake of the
gain received from those who, coming over to the word, give in the name
of piety; for a bishop of this kind at any rate does not “desire a good
work,” <span id="fr_5485"></span>[5486](#fn_5485.md) nor can he be without
reproach, nor temperate, nor sober-minded, as he is intoxicated with
glory and intemperately satiated with it.  And the same also you will
say about the elders and deacons.  And if we seem to some to have made a
digression in speaking of these things, consider if it were not
necessary that they should be said, because that evil thoughts are the
spring of all sins, and can pollute even those actions which, if they
were done apart from evil thoughts, would have justified the man who did
them.  We have thus investigated according to our ability what are the
things which defile; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the
man; but if we must say it with boldness, with unwashed heart to eat
anything whatsoever which is the natural food of our reason, defileth
the man.
