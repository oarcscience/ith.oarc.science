<span id="xv.iii.vi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>11.  Why the Passover is Said to Be that
of the “Jews.”  Its Institution:  and the Distinction Between “Feasts of
the Lord” And Feasts Not So Spoken of.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.xi-p2"></span>“And the passover of the Jews was at
hand.” <span id="fr_5017"></span>[5018](#fn_5017.md)   Inquiring into the
accuracy of the most wise John (on this passage), I put myself the
question, What is indicated by the addition “of the Jews”?  Of what
other nation was the passover a festival?  Would it not have been enough
to say, “And the passover was at hand”?  It may, however, be the case
that the human passover is one thing when kept by men not as Scripture
intended, and that the divine passover is another thing, the true
passover, observed in spirit and truth by those who worship God in
spirit and in truth; and then the distinction indicated in the text may
be that between the divine passover and that said to be of the Jews.  We
should attend to the passover law and observe what the Lord says of it
when it is first mentioned in Scripture. <span
id="fr_5018"></span>[5019](#fn_5018.md)   “And the Lord spake unto Moses
and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, This month is to you the
beginning of months, it is the first for you among the months of the
year.  Speak thou to all the congregation of the children of Israel,
saying, On the tenth of this month shall every man take a sheep,
according to the houses of your families;” then after some directions in
which the word passover does not occur again, he adds, <span
id="fr_5019"></span>[5020](#fn_5019.md) “Thus shall ye eat it, your loins
girt and your shoes on your feet, and your staves in your hands, and ye
shall eat it with haste.  It is the passover of the Lord.”  He does not
say, “It is your passover.”  And a little further on He names the
festival again in the same way, <span
id="fr_5020"></span>[5021](#fn_5020.md) “And it shall come to pass, when
your sons say to <span id="page_388">p. 388</span> <span
id="xv.iii.vi.xi-Page_388"></span>you, What is this service?  And ye
shall say to them, It is the sacrifice, the passover of the Lord, how He
guarded the houses of the children of Israel.”  And again, a little
further on, <span id="fr_5021"></span>[5022](#fn_5021.md) “And the Lord
spake to Moses and Aaron, saying, This is the law of the passover.  No
alien shall eat of it.”  And again in a little, <span
id="fr_5022"></span>[5023](#fn_5022.md) “But if a proselyte come to you,
and keep the passover of the Lord, every male of him shall be
circumcised.”  Observe that in the law we never find it said, “Your
passover;” but in all the passages quoted the phrase occurs once without
any adjunct, while we have three times “The passover of the Lord.”  To
make sure that there is such a distinction between the passover of the
Lord and the passover of the Jews, we may consider the way in which
Isaiah speaks of the matter: <span id="fr_5023"></span>[5024](#fn_5023.md)
  “Your new moons and your Sabbaths and your great day I cannot bear;
your fast and your holiday and your new moons and your feasts my soul
hateth.”  The Lord does not call them His own, these observances of
sinners (they are hated of His soul, if such there be); neither the new
moons, nor the Sabbaths, nor the great day, nor the fast, nor the
festivals.  And in the legislation about the Sabbath in Exodus, we
read, <span id="fr_5024"></span>[5025](#fn_5024.md) “And Moses said unto
them, This is the word which the Lord spake, The Sabbath is a holy rest
unto the Lord.”  And a little further on, “And Moses said, Eat ye; for
to-day is a Sabbath unto the Lord.”  And in Numbers, <span
id="fr_5025"></span>[5026](#fn_5025.md) before the sacrifices which are
offered at each festival, as if all the festivals came under the law of
the continuous and daily sacrifice, we find it written, “And the Lord
spake unto Moses, Announce to the children of Israel, and thus shalt
thou say unto them, My gifts, My offerings, My fruits for a smell of
sweet savour, ye shall observe to offer unto Me at My festivals.  And
thou shalt say unto them, These are the offerings which ye shall offer
unto the Lord.”  The festival set forth in Scripture He calls His own,
not those of the people receiving the law, He speaks of *His* gifts,
*His* offerings.  A similar way of speaking is that in Exodus with
regard to the people; it is said by God to be His own people, when it
does not sin; but in the section about the calf He abjures it and calls
it the people of Moses. <span id="fr_5026"></span>[5027](#fn_5026.md)   On
the one hand, “Thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Let My
people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness.  But if thou wilt
not let My people go, behold, I will send against thee and against thy
servants, and against thy people and against thy houses, the dog-fly;
and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of the dog-fly, and on the
land on which they are, against it will I send them.  And I will glorify
on that day the land of Gesem, on which My people are; on it there shall
be no dog-fly, that thou mayest know that I am the Lord, the Lord of all
the earth.  And I will make a distinction between My people and thy
people.”  To Moses, on the other hand, He says, <span
id="fr_5027"></span>[5028](#fn_5027.md) “Go, descend quickly, for thy
people hath transgressed, which thou leddest out of the land of Egypt.” 
As, then, the people when it does not sin is the people of God, but when
it sins is no longer spoken of as His, thus, also, the feasts when they
are hated by the Lord’s soul are said to be feasts of sinners, but when
the law is given regarding them, they are called feasts of the Lord. 
Now of these feasts passover is one, which in the passage before us is
said to be that not of the Lord, but of the Jews.  In another passage,
too, <span id="fr_5028"></span>[5029](#fn_5028.md) we find it said, “These
are the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall call chosen, holy.”  From the
mouth of the Lord Himself, then, we see that there is no gainsaying our
statement on this point.  Some one, no doubt, will ask about the words
of the Apostle, where he writes to the Corinthians: <span
id="fr_5029"></span>[5030](#fn_5029.md)   “For our Passover also was
sacrificed for us, namely, Christ;” he does not say, “The Passover of
the Lord was sacrificed, even Christ.”  To this we must say, either that
the Apostle simply calls the passover our passover because it was
sacrificed for us, or that every sacrifice which is really the Lord’s,
and the passover is one of these, awaits its consummation not in this
age nor upon earth, but in the coming age and in heaven when the kingdom
of heaven appears.  As for those feasts, one of the twelve prophets
says, <span id="fr_5030"></span>[5031](#fn_5030.md) “What will ye do in the
days of assembly, and in the days of the feast of the Lord?”  But Paul
says in the Epistle to the Hebrews: <span
id="fr_5031"></span>[5032](#fn_5031.md)   “But ye are come unto Mount Zion,
and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to ten
thousands of angels, the assembly and church of the firstborn, who are
written in heaven.”  And in the Epistle to the Colossians: <span
id="fr_5032"></span>[5033](#fn_5032.md)   “Let no one judge you in meat and
in drink, or in respect of a feast-day or a new moon, or a sabbath-day;
which are a shadow of the things to come.”
