<span id="xvi.ii.vi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>9.  Satan and the “Delivery” Of
Jesus.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.ix-p2"></span>Now we must think that the devil has
the power of death,—not of that which is common and indifferent, in
accordance with which those who are compacted of soul and body die, when
their soul is separated from the body,—but of that death which is
contrary to and the enemy of Him who said, “I am the Life,” <span
id="fr_5892"></span>[5893](#fn_5892.md) in accordance with which “the soul
that sinneth, it shall die.” <span id="fr_5893"></span>[5894](#fn_5893.md)
  But that it was not God who gave Him up into the hands of men, the
Saviour manifestly declares when He says, “If My kingdom were of this
world, then would My servants fight that I should not be delivered to
the Jews.” <span id="fr_5894"></span>[5895](#fn_5894.md)   For, when He was
delivered up to the Jews, He was delivered into the hands of men, not by
His own servants, but by the prince of this age who says, concerning the
powers which are in the sphere of the invisible, the kingdoms which are
set up against men, “All these things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt
fall down and worship Me.” <span id="fr_5895"></span>[5896](#fn_5895.md)  
Wherefore also we should think that in regard to them it was said, “The
kings of the earth stood side by side, and the rulers were gathered
together against the Lord and against His Christ.” <span
id="fr_5896"></span>[5897](#fn_5896.md)   And those kings, indeed, and
those rulers stood side by side and were gathered against the Lord and
against His Christ; but we, because we have been benefited by His being
delivered by them into the hands of men and slain, say, “Let us break
their <span id="page_481">p. 481</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vi.ix-Page_481"></span>bonds asunder and cast away their yoke
from us.” <span id="fr_5897"></span>[5898](#fn_5897.md)   For, when we
become conformed to the death of Christ, we are no longer under the
bonds of the kings of the earth, as we have said, nor under the yoke of
the princes of this age, who were gathered together against the Lord. 
And, on this account, “the Father spared not His own Son, but delivered
Him up for us all,” <span id="fr_5898"></span>[5899](#fn_5898.md) that
those, who took Him and delivered Him up into the hands of men, might be
laughed at by Him who dwells in the heavens, and might be derided by the
Lord, inasmuch as, contrary to their expectation, it was to the
destruction of their own kingdom and power, that they received from the
Father the Son, who was raised on the third day, by having abolished His
enemy death, and made us conformed, not only to the image of His death
but also of His resurrection; through whom we walk in newness of
life, <span id="fr_5899"></span>[5900](#fn_5899.md) no longer sitting “in
the region and shadow of death,” <span
id="fr_5900"></span>[5901](#fn_5900.md) through the light of God which has
sprung up upon us.  But when the Saviour said, “The Son of man shall be
delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill Him, and the
third day He shall rise again,” they were “exceeding sorry,” <span
id="fr_5901"></span>[5902](#fn_5901.md) giving heed to the fact that He was
about to be delivered up into the hands of men, and that He would be
killed, as matters gloomy and calling for sorrow, but not attending to
the fact that He would rise on the third day, as He needed no longer
time “to bring to nought through death him that had the power of
death.” <span id="fr_5902"></span>[5903](#fn_5902.md)
