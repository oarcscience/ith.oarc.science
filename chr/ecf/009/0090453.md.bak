<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xii-p2"></span>But you might sometimes gracefully
apply the passage to the lover of money, who has nothing in his mouth
but things about silver, when you behold him healed by some Peter, who
takes the stater, which is the symbol of all his avarice, not only from
his mouth and words, but from his whole character.  For you will say
that such an one was in the sea, and in the bitter affairs of life, and
in the waves of the cares and anxieties of avarice, having the stater in
his mouth when he was unbelieving and avaricious, but that he came up
from the sea and was caught in the rational net, and being benefited by
some Peter who has taught him the truth, no longer has the stater in his
mouth, but in place of it those things which contain His image, the
oracles of God.
