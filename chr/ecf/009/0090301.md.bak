id="xv.iii.v.xxv-p1.1"></span>25.  Jordan Means “Their Going Down.” 
Spiritual Meanings and Application of This.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxv-p2"></span>Let us look at the words of the Gospel
now before us.  “Jordan” means “their going down.”  The name “Jared” is
etymologically akin to it, if I may say so; it also yields the meaning
“going down;” for Jared was born to Maleleel, as it is written in the
Book of Enoch—if any one cares to accept that book as sacred—in the days
when the sons of God came down to the daughters of men.  Under this
descent some have supposed that there is an enigmatical reference to the
descent of souls into bodies, taking the phrase “daughters of men” as a
tropical expression for this earthly tabernacle.  Should this be so,
what river will “their going down” be, to which one must come to be
purified, a river going down, not with its own descent, but “theirs,”
that, namely, of men, what but our Saviour who separates those who
received their lots from Moses from those who obtained their own
portions through Jesus (Joshua)?  His current, flowing in the descending
stream, makes glad, as we find in the Psalms, <span
id="fr_4929"></span>[4930](#fn_4929.md) the city of God, not the visible
Jerusalem—for it has no river beside it—but the blameless Church of God,
built <span id="page_372">p. 372</span> <span
id="xv.iii.v.xxv-Page_372"></span>on the foundation of the Apostles and
Prophets, Christ Jesus our Lord being the chief corner-stone.  Under the
Jordan, accordingly, we have to understand the Word of God who became
flesh and tabernacled among us, Jesus who gives us as our inheritance
the humanity which He assumed, for that is the head corner-stone, which
being taken up into the deity of the Son of God, is washed by being so
assumed, and then receives into itself the pure and guileless dove of
the Spirit, bound to it and no longer able to fly away from it.  For
“Upon whomsoever,” we read, “thou shalt see the Spirit descending and
abiding upon Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.” 
Hence, he who receives the Spirit abiding on Jesus Himself is able to
baptize those who come to him in that abiding Spirit.  But John baptizes
beyond Jordan, in the regions verging on the outside of Judæa, in
Bethabara, being the forerunner of Him who came to call not the
righteous but sinners, and who taught that the whole have no need of a
physician, but they that are sick.  For it is for forgiveness of sins
that this washing is given.
