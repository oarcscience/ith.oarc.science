<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>14.  Concerning Those Who Said, Who is
the Greatest? and Concerning the Child that Was Called by Jesus.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xiv-p2"></span>“*In that day came the disciples unto
Jesus saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?*” <span
id="fr_5915"></span>[5916](#fn_5915.md)   In order that we might be taught
what it was that the disciples came to Jesus and asked to learn of Him,
and how He answered to their inquiry, Matthew, though he might have
given an account of this very thing only, has added, according to some
manuscripts, “In that hour the disciples came unto Jesus,” but,
according to others, “In that day;” and it is necessary that we should
not leave the meaning of the evangelist without examination.  Wherefore
giving attention to the words preceding “in that day,” or “hour,” let us
see if it is possible from them to find a way to understand, as being
necessary, the addition, “in that day,” or “hour.”  Jesus then had come
to Capernaum along with His disciples, where “they that received the
half-shekel came to Peter,” and asked and said, “Doth not your Master
pay the half-shekel?”  Then, when Peter answered and said to them, Yea,
Jesus giving further a defence with reference to the giving of the
half-shekel, sends Peter to drag up the fish into the net, in the mouth
of which He said that <span id="page_483">p. 483</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xiv-Page_483"></span>a stater would be found which was to
be given for Himself and Peter.  It seems to me, then, that thinking
that this was a very great honour which had been bestowed on Peter by
Jesus, who judged that he was greater than the rest of His friends, they
wished to learn accurately the truth of their suspicion, by making
inquiry of Jesus and hearing from Him, whether, as they supposed, He had
judged that Peter was greater than they; and at the same time also they
hoped to learn the ground on which Peter had been preferred to the rest
of the disciples.  Matthew then, I think, wishing to make this plain,
has subjoined to the words “that take”—the stater, to-wit—“and give unto
them for thee and me,” the words, “In that day came the disciples unto
Jesus, saying, Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” <span
id="fr_5916"></span>[5917](#fn_5916.md)   And, perhaps, they were also in
doubt because of the preference which had been given to the three at the
transfiguration, and they were in doubt about this—which of the three
was judged by the Lord to be greatest.  For John reclined on His breast
through love, and we may conclude that before the Supper they had seen
many tokens of special honour given by Jesus to John; but Peter on his
confession was called blessed in their hearing, because of his saying,
“Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God;” <span
id="fr_5917"></span>[5918](#fn_5917.md) but again because of the saying,
“Get thee behind Me, Satan; thou art a stumbling-block unto Me, for thou
mindest not the things of God but the things of men,” <span
id="fr_5918"></span>[5919](#fn_5918.md) they were distracted in mind as to
whether it was not he but one of the sons of Zebedee, that was the
greatest.  So much for the words “in that day” or “hour,” on which took
place the matters relating to the stater.
