<span id="xii.vi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Duty of Confessing
Christ.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.iii-p2"></span>Since, then, He has displayed so great
mercy towards us, and especially in this respect, that we who are living
should not offer sacrifices to gods that are dead, or pay them
worship, <span id="fr_4343"></span>[4344](#fn_4343.md) but should attain
through Him to <span id="page_252">p. 252</span> <span
id="xii.vi.iii-Page_252"></span>the knowledge of the true Father, <span
id="fr_4344"></span>[4345](#fn_4344.md) whereby shall we show that we do
indeed know Him, <span id="fr_4345"></span>[4346](#fn_4345.md) but by not
denying Him through whom this knowledge has been attained?  For He
himself declares, “Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I
confess before my Father.” <span id="fr_4346"></span>[4347](#fn_4346.md)  
This, then, is our reward if we shall confess Him by whom we have been
saved.  But in what way shall we confess Him?  By doing what He says,
and not transgressing His commandments, and by honouring Him not with
our lips only, but with all our heart and all our mind. <span
id="fr_4347"></span>[4348](#fn_4347.md)   For He says in Isaiah, “This
people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from
me.” <span id="fr_4348"></span>[4349](#fn_4348.md)
