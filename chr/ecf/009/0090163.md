<span id="xii.vi.i-p4"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xii.vi.i-p4.1"></span>Chapter I.—We Ought to Think Highly of
Christ.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.i-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xii.vi.i-p5.1"></span>Brethren</span>, it is fitting that you should
think of Jesus Christ as of God,—as the Judge of the living and the
dead.  And it does not become us to think lightly of our salvation; for
if we think little of Him, we shall also hope but to obtain little
\[from Him\].  And those of us who hear carelessly of these things, as
if they were of small importance, commit sin, not knowing whence we have
been called, and by whom, and to what place, and how much Jesus Christ
submitted to suffer for our sakes.  What return, then, shall we make to
Him, or what fruit that shall be worthy of that which He has given to
us?  For, indeed, how great are the benefits <span
id="fr_4328"></span>[4329](#fn_4328.md) which we owe to Him!  He has
graciously given us light; as a Father, He has called us sons; He has
saved us when we were ready to perish.  What praise, then, shall we give
to Him, or what return shall we make for the things which we have
received? <span id="fr_4329"></span>[4330](#fn_4329.md)   We were
deficient <span id="fr_4330"></span>[4331](#fn_4330.md) in understanding,
worshipping stones and wood, and gold, and silver, and brass, the works
of men’s hands; <span id="fr_4331"></span>[4332](#fn_4331.md) and our whole
life was nothing else than death.  Involved in blindness, and with such
darkness <span id="fr_4332"></span>[4333](#fn_4332.md) before our eyes, we
have received sight, and through His will have laid aside that cloud by
which we were enveloped.  For He had compassion on us, and mercifully
saved us, observing the many errors in which we were entangled, as well
as the destruction to which we were exposed, <span
id="fr_4333"></span>[4334](#fn_4333.md) and that we had no hope of
salvation except it came to us from Him.  For He called us when we were
not, <span id="fr_4334"></span>[4335](#fn_4334.md) and willed that out of
nothing we should attain a real existence. <span
id="fr_4335"></span>[4336](#fn_4335.md)
