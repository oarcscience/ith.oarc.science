<span id="xv.iii.ii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>11.  How No One is Righteous or Can Truly
Be Said to Live in Comparison with God.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xi-p2"></span>First let us look at the words, “He is
not the God of the dead but of the living.”  That is equivalent to
saying that He is not the God of sinners but of saints.  For it was a
great gift to the Patriarchs that God in place of His own name should
add their name to His own designation as God, as Paul says, <span
id="fr_4705"></span>[4706](#fn_4705.md) “Therefore God is not ashamed to be
called their God.”  He is the God, therefore, of the fathers and of all
the saints; it might be hard to find a passage to the effect that God is
the God of any of the wicked.  If, then, He is the God of the saints,
and is said to be the God of the living, then the saints are the living
and the living are saints; neither is there any saint outside the
living, nor when any one is called living is the further implication
absent that in addition to his having life he is a holy one.  Near akin
to this is the lesson to be drawn from the saying, <span
id="fr_4706"></span>[4707](#fn_4706.md) “I shall be well pleasing to the
Lord in the land of the living.”  The good pleasure of the Lord, he
appears to say, is in the ranks of the saints, or in the place of the
saints, and it is there that he hopes to be.  No one pleases God well
who has not entered the rank of the saints, or the place of the saints;
and to that place every one must come who has assumed beforehand, as it
were in this life, the shadow and image of true God-pleasing.  The
passage which declares that before God no living being shall be
justified shows that in comparison with God and the righteousness that
is in Him none, even of the most finished saints, will be justified.  We
might take a parable from another quarter and say that no candle can
give light before the sun, not that the candle will not give light, only
it will not when the sun outshines it.  In the same way every “living”
will be justified, only not before God, when it is compared with those
who are below and who are in the power of darkness.  To them the light
of the saints will shine.  Here, perhaps, we have the key to the meaning
of that verse: <span id="fr_4707"></span>[4708](#fn_4707.md)   “Let your
light shine before men.”  He does not say, Let your light shine before
God; had he said so he would have given a commandment impossible of
fulfilment, as if he had bidden those lights which have souls to let
their light shine before the sun.  It is not only, therefore, the
ordinary mass of the living who will not be justified before God, but
even those among the living who are distinguished above the rest, or, to
put it more truly, the whole righteousness of the living will not be
justified before God, as compared with the righteousness of God, as if I
were to call together all the lights which shine on the earth by night,
and to say that they could not give light in comparison with the rays of
the sun.  We rise from these considerations to a higher level when we
take the words before our minds, “I live, saith the Lord.”  Life, in the
full sense of the word, especially after what we have been saying on the
subject, belongs perhaps to God and none but Him.  Is this the reason
why the Apostle, after speaking of the supreme excellency of the life of
God and being led to the highest expression about it, says about God
(showing in this a true understanding of that saying, “I live, saith the
Lord”); “who only hath immortality.” <span
id="fr_4708"></span>[4709](#fn_4708.md)   No living being besides God has
life free from change and variation.  Why should we be in further
doubt?  Even Christ did not share the Father’s immortality; for He
“tasted death for every man.”
