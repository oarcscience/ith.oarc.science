<span id="xv.iii.i.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xvii-p1.1"></span>17.  (2) in Time.  The Beginning of
Creation.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xvii-p2"></span>Again, there is a beginning in a
matter of origin, as might appear in the saying: <span
id="fr_4530"></span>[4531](#fn_4530.md)   “In the beginning God made the
heaven and the earth.”  This meaning, however, appears more plainly in
the Book of Job in the passage: <span
id="fr_4531"></span>[4532](#fn_4531.md)   “This is the beginning of God’s
creation, made for His angels to mock at.”  One would suppose that the
heavens and the earth were made first, of all that was made at the
creation of the world.  But the second passage suggests a better view,
namely, that as many beings were framed with a body, the first made of
these was the creature called dragon, but called in another
passage <span id="fr_4532"></span>[4533](#fn_4532.md) the great whale
(leviathan) which the Lord tamed.  We must ask about this; whether, when
the saints were living a blessed life apart from matter and from any
body, the dragon, falling from the pure life, became fit to be bound in
matter and in a body, so that the Lord could say, speaking through storm
and clouds, “This is the beginning of the creation of God, made for His
angels to mock at.”  It is possible, however, that the dragon is not
positively the beginning of the creation of the Lord, but that there
were many creatures made with a body for the angels to mock at, and that
the dragon was the first of these, while others could subsist in a body
without such reproach.  But it is not so.  For the soul of the sun is
placed in a body, and the whole creation, of which the Apostle
says: <span id="fr_4533"></span>[4534](#fn_4533.md)   “The whole creation
groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now,” and perhaps the
following is about the same:  “The creation was made subject to vanity,
not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected it for hope;” so that
bodies might be in vanity, and doing the things of the body, as he who
is in the body must. <span id="fr_4534"></span>[4535](#fn_4534.md) …One who
is in the body does the things of the body, though unwillingly. 
Wherefore the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but he
who does unwillingly the things of the body does what he does for the
sake of hope, as if we should say that Paul desired to remain in the
flesh, not willingly, but on account of hope.  For though he thought it
better <span id="fr_4535"></span>[4536](#fn_4535.md) to be dissolved and to
be with Christ, it was not unreasonable that he should wish to remain in
the flesh for the sake of the benefit to others and of advancement in
the things hoped for, not only by him, but also by those benefited by
him.  This meaning of the term “beginning,” as of origin, will serve us
also in the passage in which Wisdom speaks in the Proverbs. <span
id="fr_4536"></span>[4537](#fn_4536.md)   “God,” we read, “created me the
beginning of His ways, for His works.”  Here the term could be
interpreted as in the first application we spoke of, that of a way: 
“The Lord,” it says, “created me the beginning of His ways.”  One might
assert, and with reason, that God Himself is the beginning of all
things, and might go on to say, as is plain, that the Father is the
beginning of the Son; and the demiurge the beginning of the works of the
demiurge, and that God in a word is the beginning of all that exists. 
This view is supported by our:  “In the beginning was the Word.”  In the
Word one may see the Son, and because He is in the Father He may be said
to be in the beginning.
