<span id="xvi.ii.iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>9.  Explanation of “Corban.”</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.ix-p2"></span>Jesus, however, does not accuse them
with reference to a tradition of the Jewish elders, but with regard to
two most imperative commandments of God, the one of which was the fifth
in the decalogue, being as follows:  “Honour thy father and thy mother,
that it may be well with thee, and that thy days may be long on the land
which the Lord thy God giveth thee;” <span
id="fr_5409"></span>[5410](#fn_5409.md) and the other was written thus in
Leviticus, “If a man speak evil of his father or his mother, let him die
the death; he has spoken evil of his father or mother, he shall be
guilty.” <span id="fr_5410"></span>[5411](#fn_5410.md)   But when we wish
to examine the very letter of the words as given by Matthew, “He that
speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death,” <span
id="fr_5411"></span>[5412](#fn_5411.md) consider whether it was taken from
the place where it was written, “Whoso striketh his father or mother,
let him die the death; and he that speaketh evil of father or mother let
him die <span id="page_438">p. 438</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iv.ix-Page_438"></span>the death.” <span
id="fr_5412"></span>[5413](#fn_5412.md)   For such are the exact words
taken from the Law with regard to the two commandments; but Matthew has
quoted them in part and in an abridged form, and not in the very words. 
But what the nature of the charge is which the Saviour brings against
the Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem, when He says that they
transgress the commandment of God because of their tradition we must
consider.  And God said, “Honour thy father and thy mother,” <span
id="fr_5413"></span>[5414](#fn_5413.md) teaching that the child should pay
the honour which is due to his parents.  Of this honour to parents one
part was to share with them the necessaries of life, such as food and
clothing, and if there was any other thing in which it was possible for
them to show favour towards their own parents.  But the Pharisees and
scribes promulgated in opposition to the law a tradition which is found
rather obscurely in the Gospel, and which we ourselves would not have
thought of, unless one of the Hebrews had given to us the following
facts relating to the passage.  Sometimes, he says, when money-lenders
fell in with stubborn debtors who were able but not willing to pay their
debts, they consecrated what was due to the account of the poor, for
whom money was cast into the treasury by each of those who wished to
give a portion of their goods to the poor according to their ability. 
They, therefore, said sometimes to their debtors in their own tongue,
“That which you owe to me is Corban,”—that is, a gift—“for I have
consecrated it to the poor, to the account of piety towards God.”  Then
the debtor, as no longer in debt to men but to God and to piety towards
God, was shut up, as it were, even though unwilling, to payment of the
debt, no longer to the money-lender, but now to God for the account of
the poor, in name of the money-lender.  What then the money-lender did
to the debtor, that sometimes some sons did to their parents and said to
them, “That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me, father or
mother, know that you will receive this from Corban,” <span
id="fr_5414"></span>[5415](#fn_5414.md) from the account of the poor who
are consecrated to God.  Then the parents, hearing that that which
should have been given to them was Corban,—consecrated to God,—no longer
wished to take it from their sons, even though they were in extreme need
of the necessaries of life.  The elders, then, declared to the people a
tradition of this kind, “Whosoever said to his father or mother, that
which should be given to any of them is Corban and a gift, that man was
no longer a debtor to his father or mother in respect of giving to them
the necessaries of life.”  The Saviour censures this tradition, as not
being sound but opposed to the commandment of God.  For if God says,
“Honour thy father and thy mother,” but the tradition said, he is not
bound to honour his father or mother by a gift, who has consecrated to
God, as Corban, that which would have been given to his parents,
manifestly the commandment of God concerning the honour due to parents
was made void by the tradition of the Pharisees and scribes which said,
that he was no longer bound to honour his father or mother, who had,
once for all, consecrated to God that which the parents would have
received.  And the Pharisees, as lovers of money, in order that under
pretext of the poor they might receive even that which would have been
given to the parents of any one, gave such teaching.  And the Gospel
testifies to their love of money, saying, “But the Pharisees who were
lovers of money heard these things and they scoffed at Him.” <span
id="fr_5415"></span>[5416](#fn_5415.md)   If, then, any one of those who
are called elders among us, or of those who are in any way rulers of the
people, profess to give to the poor under the name of the commonweal,
rather than to be of those who give to their kindred if they should
chance to be in need of the necessaries of life, and those who give
cannot do both, this man might with justice be called a brother of those
Pharisees who made void the word of God through their own tradition, and
were accused by the Saviour as hypocrites.  And as a very powerful
deterrent to any one from being anxious to take from the account of the
poor, and from thinking that “the piety of others is a way of
gain,” <span id="fr_5416"></span>[5417](#fn_5416.md) we have not only these
things, but also that which is recorded about the traitor Judas, who in
appearance championed the cause of the poor, and said with indignation,
“This ointment might have been sold for three hundred pence and given to
the poor,” <span id="fr_5417"></span>[5418](#fn_5417.md) but in reality
“was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein.” <span
id="fr_5418"></span>[5419](#fn_5418.md)   If, then, any one in our time who
has the bag of the Church speaks likes Judas on behalf of the poor, but
takes away what is put therein, let there be assigned to him the portion
along with Judas who did these things; on account of which things eating
like a gangrene into his soul, the devil cast it into his <span
id="page_439">p. 439</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iv.ix-Page_439"></span>heart to betray the Saviour; and, when
he had received the “fiery dart,” <span
id="fr_5419"></span>[5420](#fn_5419.md) with reference to this end, the
devil afterwards himself entered into his soul and took full possession
of him.  And perhaps, when the Apostle says, “The love of money is a
root of all evils,” <span id="fr_5420"></span>[5421](#fn_5420.md) he says
it because of Judas’ love of money, which was a root of all the evils
that were committed against Jesus.
