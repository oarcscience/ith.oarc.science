<span id="xvi.ii.vii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.v-p1.1"></span>5.  The Limit of Forgiveness.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.v-p2"></span>“*Then came Peter and said unto Him,
Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive
him?*” <span id="fr_6070"></span>[6071](#fn_6070.md)   The conception that
these things were said in a simple sense by Peter, as if he were
inquiring whether he was to forgive his brother when he sinned against
him seven times, but no longer if he sinned an eighth time, and by the
Saviour, as if He thought that one should sit still and reckon up the
sins of his neighbours against him in order that he might forgive
seventy times and seven, but that from the seventy-eighth he should not
forgive the man who wronged him, seems to me altogether silly and
unworthy alike of the progress which Peter had made in the company of
Jesus and of the divine magnanimity of Jesus.  Perhaps, then, these
things also border on an obscurity akin to the words, “Hear My voice, ye
<span id="page_497">p. 497</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vii.v-Page_497"></span>wives of Lamech,” <span
id="fr_6071"></span>[6072](#fn_6071.md) etc.  If any one has already become
a friend of Jesus so as to be taught by His spirit which illumines the
reason of him who has advanced so far according to his desert, he might
know the true meaning, therefore, in regard to these things, and such as
Jesus Himself would have clearly expounded it; but we who fall short of
the greatness of the friendship of Jesus must be content if we can
babble a little about the passage.  The number six, then, appears to be
working and toilsome, but the number seven to contain the idea of
repose.  And consider if you can say that he, who loves the world and
works the things of the world, and does those things which are material,
sins six times, and that the number seven is the end of sin in his case,
so that Peter with some such thought in his mind wished to pardon seven
sins of those which his brother had committed against him.  But since as
units the tens and the hundreds have a certain common measure of
proportion to the number which is in units, and Jesus knew that the
number might be exceeded, on this account, I think, that He added to the
number seven also the seventy, <span
id="fr_6072"></span>[6073](#fn_6072.md) and said that there ought to be
forgiveness to brethren here, and to them who have sinned in respect to
things here.  But if any one going beyond the things about the world and
this age were to commit sin, even if it were trifling, he could not
longer reasonably have forgiveness of sins; for forgiveness extends to
the things here, and in relation to the sins committed here, whether the
forgiveness comes late or soon; but there is no forgiveness, not even to
a brother, who has sinned beyond the seven and seventy times.  But you
might say that he who has sinned in such wise, whether as against Peter
his brother, or as against Peter, against whom the gates of Hades do not
prevail, is by sins of this kind in the smaller number of the sin, but
according to sins still worse is in the number which has no forgiveness
of sins.
