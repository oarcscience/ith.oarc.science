<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxv-p1.1"></span>25.  Reference to the Saying of Paul About
Crucifixion with Christ.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxv-p2"></span>Moreover in regard to the saying, “Let
him deny himself,” <span id="fr_5722"></span>[5723](#fn_5722.md) the
following saying of Paul who denied himself seems appropriate, “Yet I
live, and yet no longer I but Christ liveth in me;” <span
id="fr_5723"></span>[5724](#fn_5723.md) for the expression, “I live, yet no
longer I,” was the voice of one denying himself, as of one who had laid
aside his own life and taken on himself the Christ, in order that He
might live in him as Righteousness, and as Wisdom, and as
Sanctification, and as our Peace, <span
id="fr_5724"></span>[5725](#fn_5724.md) and as the Power of God, who
worketh all things in him.  But further also, attend to this, that while
there are many forms of dying, the Son of God was crucified, being
hanged on a tree, in order that all who die unto sin may die to it, in
no other way than by the way of the cross.  Wherefore they will say, “I
have been crucified with Christ,” and, “Far be it from me to glory save
in the cross of the Lord, through which the world has been crucified
unto me and I unto the world.” <span
id="fr_5725"></span>[5726](#fn_5725.md)   For perhaps also each of those
who have been crucified with Christ puts off from himself the
principalities and the powers, and makes a show of them and triumphs
over them in the cross; <span id="fr_5726"></span>[5727](#fn_5726.md) or
rather, Christ does these things in them.
