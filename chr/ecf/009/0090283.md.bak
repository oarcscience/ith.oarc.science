<span id="xv.iii.v.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>7.  Of the Birth of John, and of His
Alleged Identity with Elijah.  Of the Doctrine of
Transcorporation.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.vii-p2"></span>“And <span
id="fr_4839"></span>[4840](#fn_4839.md) they asked him, What then?  Art
thou Elijah? and he said, I am not.”  No one can fail to remember in
this connection what Jesus says of John, <span
id="fr_4840"></span>[4841](#fn_4840.md) “If ye will receive it, this is
Elijah which is to come.”  How, then, does John come to say to those who
ask him, “Art thou Elijah?”—“I am not.”  And how can it be true at the
same time that John is Elijah who is to come, according to the words of
Malachi, <span id="fr_4841"></span>[4842](#fn_4841.md) “And behold I send
unto you Elijah the Tishbite, before the great and notable day of the
Lord come, who shall restore the heart of the father to the son, and the
heart of a man to his neighbour, lest I come, and utterly smite the
earth.”  The words of the angel of the Lord, too, who appeared to
Zacharias, as he stood at the right hand of the altar of incense, are
somewhat to the same effect as the prophecy of Malachi:  “And <span
id="fr_4842"></span>[4843](#fn_4842.md) thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee
a son, and thou shalt call his name John.”  And a little further
on: <span id="fr_4843"></span>[4844](#fn_4843.md)   “And he shall go before
His face in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the
fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just,
to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for Him.”  As for the first
point, one might say that John did not know that he was Elijah.  This
will be the explanation of those who find in our passage a support for
their doctrine of transcorporation, as if the soul clothed itself in a
fresh body and did not quite remember its former lives.  These thinkers
will also point out that some of the Jews assented to this doctrine when
they spoke about the Saviour as if He was one of the old prophets, and
had risen not from the tomb but from His birth.  His mother Mary was
well known, and Joseph the carpenter was supposed to be His father, and
it could readily be supposed that He was one of the old prophets risen
from the dead.  <span id="page_356">p. 356</span> <span
id="xv.iii.v.vii-Page_356"></span>The same person will adduce the text
in Genesis, <span id="fr_4844"></span>[4845](#fn_4844.md) “I will destroy
the whole resurrection,” and will thereby reduce those who give
themselves to finding in Scripture solutions of false probabilities to a
great difficulty in respect of this doctrine.  Another, however, a
churchman, who repudiates the doctrine of transcorporation as a false
one, and does not admit that the soul of John ever was Elijah, may
appeal to the above-quoted words of the angel, and point out that it is
not the soul of Elijah that is spoken of at John’s birth, but the spirit
and power of Elijah.  “He shall go before him,” it is said, “in the
spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
children.”  Now it can be shown from thousands of texts that the spirit
is a different thing from the soul, and that what is called the power is
a different thing from both the soul and the spirit.  On these points I
cannot now enlarge; this work must not be unduly expanded.  To establish
the fact that power is different from spirit, it will be enough to cite
the text, <span id="fr_4845"></span>[4846](#fn_4845.md) “The Holy Spirit
shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
thee.”  As for the spirits of the prophets, these are given to them by
God, and are spoken of as being in a manner their property (slaves), as
“The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,” <span
id="fr_4846"></span>[4847](#fn_4846.md) and “The spirit of Elijah rested
upon Elisha.” <span id="fr_4847"></span>[4848](#fn_4847.md)   Thus, it is
said, there is nothing absurd in supposing that John, “in the spirit and
power of Elijah,” turned the hearts of the fathers to the children, and
that it was on account of this spirit that he was called “Elijah who was
to come.”  And to reinforce this view it may be argued that if the God
of the universe identified Himself with His saints to such an extent as
to be called the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of
Jacob, much more might the Holy Spirit so identify Himself with the
prophets as to be called their spirit, so that when the spirit is spoken
of it might be the spirit of Elijah or the spirit of Isaiah.  Our
churchman, to go on with his views, may further say that those who
supposed Jesus to be one of the prophets risen from the dead were
probably misled, partly by the doctrine above mentioned, and partly by
supposing Him to be one of the prophets, and that as for this
misconception that He was one of the prophets, these persons probably
fell into their error from not knowing about Jesus’ supposed father and
actual mother, and considering that He had risen from the tombs.  As for
the text in Genesis about the resurrection, the churchman will rejoin
with a text to an opposite effect, “God hath raised up for me another
seed in place of Abel whom Cain slew;” <span
id="fr_4848"></span>[4849](#fn_4848.md) showing that the resurrection
occurs in Genesis.  As for the first difficulty which was raised, our
churchman will meet the view of the believers in transcorporation by
saying that John is no doubt, in a certain sense, as he has already
shown, Elijah who is to come; and that the reason why he met the enquiry
of the priests and levites with “I am not,” was that he divined the
object they had in view in making it.  For the enquiry laid before John
by the priests and levites was not intended to bring out whether the
same spirit was in both, but whether John was that very Elijah who was
taken up, and who now appeared according to the expectation of the Jews
without being born (for the emissaries, perhaps, did not know about
John’s birth); and to such all enquiry he naturally answered, “I am
not;” for he who was called John was not Elijah who was taken up, and
had not changed his body for his present appearance.  Our first scholar,
whose view of transcorporation we have seen based upon our passage, may
go on with a close examination of the text, and urge against his
antagonist, that if John was the son of such a man as the priest
Zacharias, and if he was born when his parents were both aged, contrary
to all human expectation, then it is not likely that so many Jews at
Jerusalem would be so ignorant about him, or that the priests and
levites whom they sent would not be acquainted with the facts of his
birth.  Does not Luke declare <span id="fr_4849"></span>[4850](#fn_4849.md)
that “fear came upon all those who lived round about,”—clearly round
about Zacharias and Elisabeth—and that “all these things were noised
abroad throughout the whole hill country of Judæa”?  And if John’s birth
from Zacharias was a matter of common knowledge, and the Jews of
Jerusalem yet sent priests and levites to ask, “Art thou Elijah?” then
it is clear that in saying this they assumed the doctrine of
transcorporation to be true, and that it was a current doctrine of their
country, and not foreign to their secret teaching.  John therefore says,
I am not Elijah, because he does not know about his own former life. 
These thinkers, accordingly, entertain an opinion which is by no means
to be despised.  Our churchman, however, may return to the charge, and
ask if it is worthy of a prophet, <span id="page_357">p. 357</span>
<span id="xv.iii.v.vii-Page_357"></span>who is enlightened by the Holy
Spirit, who is predicted by Isaiah, and whose birth was foretold before
it took place by so great an angel, one who has received of the fulness
of Christ, who shares in such a grace, who knows truth to have come
through Jesus Christ, and has taught such deep things about God and
about the only-begotten, who is in the bosom of the Father, is it worthy
of such a one to lie, or even to hesitate, out of ignorance of what he
was.  For with respect to what was obscure, he ought to have refrained
from confessing, and to have neither affirmed nor denied the proposition
put before him.  If the doctrine in question really was widely current,
ought not John to have hesitated to pronounce upon it, lest his soul had
actually been in Elijah?  And here our churchman will appeal to history,
and will bid his antagonists ask experts of the secret doctrines of the
Hebrews, if they do really entertain such a belief.  For if it should
appear that they do not, then the argument based on that supposition is
shown to be quite baseless.  Our churchman, however, is still free to
have recourse to the solution given before, and to insist that attention
be paid to the meaning with which the question was put.  For if, as I
showed, the senders knew John to be the child of Zacharias and
Elisabeth, and if the messengers still more, being men of priestly race,
could not possibly be ignorant of the remarkable manner in which their
kinsman Zacharias had received his son, then what could be the meaning
of their question, “Art thou Elijah?”  Had they not read that Elijah had
been taken up into heaven, and did they not expect him to appear?  Then,
as they expect Elijah to come at the consummation before Christ, and
Christ to follow him, perhaps their question was meant less in a literal
than in a tropical sense:  Are you he who announces beforehand the word
which is to come before Christ, at the consummation?  To this he very
properly answers, “I am not.”  The adversary, however, tries to show
that the priests could not be ignorant that the birth of John had taken
place in so remarkable a manner, because “all these things had been much
spoken of in the hill country of Judæa;” and the churchman has to meet
this.  He does so by showing that a similar mistake was widely current
about the Saviour Himself; for “some said that He was John the Baptist,
others Elijah, others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” <span
id="fr_4850"></span>[4851](#fn_4850.md)   So the disciples told the Lord
when He was in the parts of Cæsarea Philippi, and questioned them on
that subject.  And Herod, too, said, <span
id="fr_4851"></span>[4852](#fn_4851.md) “John whom I beheaded, he is risen
from the dead;” so that he appears not to have known what was said about
Christ, as reported in the Gospel, <span
id="fr_4852"></span>[4853](#fn_4852.md) “Is not this the son of the
carpenter, is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James, and
Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?  And His sisters, are they not all with
us?”  Thus in the case of the Saviour, while many knew of His birth from
Mary, others were under a mistake about Him; and so in the case of John,
there is no wonder if, while some knew of his birth from Zacharias,
others were in doubt whether the expected Elijah had appeared in him or
not.  There was not more room for doubt about John, whether he was
Elijah, than about the Saviour, whether He was John.  Of the two, the
question of the outward form of Elijah could be disposed of from the
words of Scripture, though not from actual observation, for we
read, <span id="fr_4853"></span>[4854](#fn_4853.md) “He was a hairy man,
and girt with a leather girdle about his loins.”  John’s outward
appearance, on the contrary, was well known, and was not like that of
Jesus; and yet there were those who surmised that John had risen from
the dead, and taken the name of Jesus.  As for the change of name, a
thing which reminds us of mysteries, I do not know how the Hebrews came
to tell about Phinehas, son of Eleazar, who admittedly prolonged his
life to the time of many of the judges, as we read in the Book of
Judges, <span id="fr_4854"></span>[4855](#fn_4854.md) to tell about him
what I now mention.  They say that he was Elijah, because he had been
promised immortality (in Numbers <span
id="fr_4855"></span>[4856](#fn_4855) .md), on account of the covenant of
peace granted to him because he was jealous with a divine jealousy, and
in a passion of anger pierced the Midianitish woman and the Israelite,
and stayed the wrath of God as it is called, as it is written,
“Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, hath turned my wrath
away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my
jealousy among them.”  No wonder, then, if those who conceived Phinehas
and Elijah to be the same person, whether they judged soundly in this or
not, for that is not now the question, considered John and Jesus also to
be the same.  This, then, they doubted, and desired to know if John and
Elijah were the same.  At another time than this, the point would
certainly <span id="page_358">p. 358</span> <span
id="xv.iii.v.vii-Page_358"></span>call for a careful enquiry, and the
argument would have to be well weighed as to the essence of the soul, as
to the principle of her composition, and as to her entering into this
body of earth.  We should also have to enquire into the distributions of
the life of each soul, and as to her departure from this life, and
whether it is possible for her to enter into a second life in a body or
not, and whether that takes place at the same period, and after the same
arrangement in each case, or not; and whether she enters the same body,
or a different one, and if the same, whether the subject remains the
same while the qualities are changed, or if both subject and qualities
remain the same, and if the soul will always make use of the same body
or will change it.  Along with these questions, it would also be
necessary to ask what transcorporation is, and how it differs from
incorporation, and if he who holds transcorporation must necessarily
hold the world to be eternal.  The views of these scholars must also be
taken into account, who consider that, according to the Scriptures, the
soul is sown along with the body, and the consequences of such a view
must also be looked at.  In fact the subject of the soul is a wide one,
and hard to be unravelled, and it has to be picked out of scattered
expressions of Scripture.  It requires, therefore, separate treatment. 
The brief consideration we have been led to give to the problem in
connection with Elijah and John may now suffice; we go on to what
follows in the Gospel.
