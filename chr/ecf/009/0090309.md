and Evening Sacrifice.  Significance of This.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxxiii-p2"></span>Now we find the lamb offered in the
continual (daily) sacrifice.  Thus it is written, <span
id="fr_4958"></span>[4959](#fn_4958) “This is that which thou shalt
offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day
continually, for a continual sacrifice.  The one lamb thou shalt offer
in the morning, and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and a tenth
part of fine flour mingled with beaten oil, the fourth part of a hin;
and for a drink-offering the fourth part of a bin of wine to the first
lamb.  And the other lamb thou shalt offer in the evening, according to
the first sacrifice and according to its drink-offering.  Thou shalt
offer a sweet savour, an offering to the Lord, a continual burnt
offering throughout your generations at the door of tent of witness
before the Lord, where I will make myself known to thee, to speak unto
thee.  And I will appoint thee for the children of Israel, and I will be
sanctified in my glory, and with sanctification I will sanctify the tent
of witness.”  But what other continual sacrifice can there be to the man
of reason in the world of mind, but the Word growing to maturity, the
Word who is symbolically called a lamb and who is offered as soon as the
soul receives illumination.  This would be the continual sacrifice of
the morning, and it is offered again when the sojourn of the mind with
divine things comes to an end.  For it cannot maintain for ever its
inter<span id="page_377">p. 377</span> <span
id="xv.iii.v.xxxiii-Page_377"></span>course with higher things, seeing
that the soul is appointed to be yoked together with the body which is
of earth and heavy.
