<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>36.  Concerning the Transfiguration of
the Saviour.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxvi-p2"></span>“*Now after six days,*” according to
Matthew and Mark, <span id="fr_5778"></span>[5779](#fn_5778.md) “*He taketh
with him Peter and James and John his brother, and leads them up into a
high mountain apart, and was transfigured before them.*”  Now, also, let
it be granted, before the exposition that occurs to us in relation to
these things, that this took place long ago, and according to the
letter.  But it seems to me, that those who are led up by Jesus into the
high mountain, and are deemed worthy of beholding His transfiguration
apart, are not without purpose led up six days after the discourses
previously spoken.  For since in six days—the perfect number—the whole
world,—this perfect work of art,—was made, on this account I think that
he who transcends all the things of the world by beholding no longer the
things which are seen, for they are temporal, but already the things
which not seen, and only the things which are not seen, because that
they are eternal, is represented in the words, “After six days Jesus
took up with Him” certain persons.  If therefore any one of us wishes to
be taken by Jesus, and led up by Him into the high mountain, and be
deemed worthy of beholding His transfiguration apart, let him pass
beyond the six days, because he no longer beholds the things which are
seen, nor longer loves the world, nor the things in the world, <span
id="fr_5779"></span>[5780](#fn_5779.md) nor lusts after any worldly lust,
which is the lust of bodies, and of the riches of the body, and of the
glory which is after the flesh, and whatever things whose nature it is
to distract and drag away the soul from the things which are better and
diviner, and bring it down and fix it fast to the deceit of this age, in
wealth and glory, and the rest of the lusts which are the foes of
truth.  For when he has passed through the six days, as we have <span
id="page_470">p. 470</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxxvi-Page_470"></span>said, he will keep a new Sabbath,
rejoicing in the lofty mountain, because he sees Jesus transfigured
before him; for the Word has different forms, as He appears to each as
is expedient for the beholder, and is manifested to no one beyond the
capacity of the beholder.
