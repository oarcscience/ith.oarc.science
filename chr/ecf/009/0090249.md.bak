<span id="xv.iii.ii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.x-p1.1"></span>10.  “That Which Was Made Was Life in Him,
and the Life Was the Light of Men.”  This Involves the Paradox that What
Does Not Derive Life from the Logos Does Not Live at All.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.x-p2"></span>The Greeks have certain apothegms,
called paradoxes, in which the wisdom of their sages is presented at its
highest, and some proof, or what appears to be proof, is given.  Thus it
is said that the wise man alone, and that every wise man, is a priest,
because the wise man alone and every wise man possesses knowledge as to
the service of God.  Again, that the wise man alone and that every wise
man is free and has received from the divine law authority to do what he
himself is minded to do, and this authority they call lawful power of
decision.  Why should we say more about these so-called paradoxes?  Much
discussion is devoted to them, and they call for a comparison of the
sense of Scripture with the doctrine thus conveyed. so that we may be in
a position to determine where religious doctrine agrees with them and
where it differs from them.  This has been suggested to us by our study
of the words, “That which was made was life in Him;” for it appears
possible to follow the words of Scripture here and to make out a number
of things which partake of the character of the paradoxes and are even
more paradoxical than these sentences of the Greeks.  If we consider the
Logos in the beginning, who was with God, God the Word, we shall perhaps
be able to declare that only he who partakes of this being, considered
in this character, is to be pronounced reasonable (“logical”), and thus
we should demonstrate that the saint alone is reasonable.  Again, if we
apprehend that life has come in the Logos, he, namely, who said, “I am
the life,” then we shall say that no one is alive who is outside the
faith of Christ, that all are dead who are not living to God, that their
life is life to sin, and therefore, if I may so express myself, a life
of death.  Consider however, whether the divine Scriptures do not in
many places teach this; as where the Saviour says, <span
id="fr_4702"></span>[4703](#fn_4702.md) “Or have ye not read that which was
spoken at the bush, I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the
God of Jacob.  He is not God of the dead but of the living.”  And <span
id="fr_4703"></span>[4704](#fn_4703.md) “Before Thee shall no living being
be justified.”  But why need we speak about God Himself or the Saviour? 
For it is disputed to which of them the voice belongs which says in the
prophets, <span id="fr_4704"></span>[4705](#fn_4704.md) “As I live, saith
the Lord.”
