<span id="xvi.ii.v.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.v-p1.1"></span>5.  Concerning the Leaven of the
Pharisees.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.v-p2"></span>“*And His disciples came to the other
side and forgot to take loaves.*” <span
id="fr_5584"></span>[5585](#fn_5584)   Since the loaves which they had
before they came to the other side were no longer useful to the
disciples when they came to the other side, for they needed one kind of
loaves before they crossed and a different kind when they crossed,—on
this account, being careless of taking loaves when going to the other
side, they forgot to take loaves with them.  To the other side then came
the disciples of Jesus who had passed over from things material to
things spiritual, and from things sensible to those which are
intellectual.  And perhaps that He might turn back those who, by
crossing to the other side, “had begun in spirit,” <span
id="fr_5585"></span>[5586](#fn_5585) from running back to carnal things,
Jesus said to them when on the other side, “Take heed and beware.” <span
id="fr_5586"></span>[5587](#fn_5586)   For there was a certain lump of
teaching <span id="page_453">p. 453</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.v-Page_453"></span>and of truly ancient leaven,—that
according to the bare letter, and on this account not freed from those
things which arise from wickedness,—which the Pharisees and Sadducees
offered, of which Jesus does not wish His own disciples any longer to
eat, having made for them a new and spiritual lump, offering Himself to
those who gave up the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees and had come
to Him—“the living bread which came down from heaven and gives life to
the world.” <span id="fr_5587"></span>[5588](#fn_5587)   But since, to
him who is no longer going to use the leaven and the lump and the
teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, the first thing is to “see”
and then to “beware,” so that no one, by reason of not seeing and from
want of taking heed, may ever partake of their forbidden leaven,—on this
account He says to the disciples, first, “see,” and then, “beware.”  It
is the mark of the clear-sighted and careful to separate the leaven of
the Pharisees and Sadducees and every food that is not of “the
unleavened-bread of sincerity and truth” <span
id="fr_5588"></span>[5589](#fn_5588) from the living bread, even that
which came down from heaven, so that no one who eats may adopt the
things of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, but by eating the living and
true bread may strengthen his soul.  And we might seasonably apply the
saying to those who, along with the Christian way of life, prefer to
live as the Jews, materially, for these do not see nor beware of the
leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, but, contrary to the will of
Jesus who forbade it, eat the bread of the Pharisees.  Yea and also all,
who do not wish to understand that the law is spiritual, and has a
shadow of the good things to come, <span
id="fr_5589"></span>[5590](#fn_5589) and is a shadow of the things to
come, <span id="fr_5590"></span>[5591](#fn_5590) neither inquire of what
good thing about to be each of the laws is a shadow, nor do they see nor
beware of the leaven of the Pharisees; and they also who reject the
doctrine of the resurrection of the dead are not on their guard against
the leaven of the Sadducees.  And there are many among the heterodox
who, because of their unbelief in regard to the resurrection of the
dead, are imbued with the leaven of the Sadducees.  Now, while Jesus
said these things, the disciples reasoned, saying not aloud, but in
their own hearts, “We took no loaves.” <span
id="fr_5591"></span>[5592](#fn_5591)   And something like this was what
they said, “If we had loaves we would not have had to take of the leaven
of the Pharisees and the Sadducees; but since, from want of loaves, we
run the risk of taking from their leaven, while the Saviour does not
wish us to run back to their teaching, therefore He said to us, “Take
heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the
Sadducees.”” <span id="fr_5592"></span>[5593](#fn_5592)   And these
things then they reasoned; Jesus, while looking to that which was in
their hearts, and hearing the reasons in them, as the true overseer of
hearts, reproves them because they did not see nor remember the loaves
which they received from Him; on account of which, even when they
appeared to be in want of loaves, they did not need the leaven of the
Pharisees and the Sadducees.
