id="xv.iii.ii.xxv-p1.1"></span>25.  Argument from the Prayer of Joseph,
to Show that the Baptist May Have Been an Angel Who Became a Man.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xxv-p2"></span>As we are now engaged with what is
said of John, and are asking about his mission, I may take the
opportunity to state the view which I entertain about him.  We have read
this prophecy about him, “Behold, I send My messenger (angel) before Thy
face, who shall prepare Thy way before Thee;” and at this we ask if it
can be one of the holy angels who is sent down on this ministry as
forerunner of our Saviour.  No wonder if, when the first-born of all
creation was assuming a human body, some of them should <span
id="page_341">p. 341</span> <span
id="xv.iii.ii.xxv-Page_341"></span>have been filled with love to man and
become admirers and followers of Christ, and thought it good to minister
to his kindness towards man by having a body like that of men.  And who
would not be moved at the thought of his leaping for joy when yet in the
belly, surpassing as he did the common nature of man?  Should the piece
entitled “The prayer of Joseph,” one of the apocryphal works current
among the Hebrews, be thought worthy of credence, this dogma will be
found in it clearly expressed.  Those at the beginning, it is
represented, having some marked distinction beyond men, and being much
greater than other souls, because they were angels, they have come down
to human nature.  Thus Jacob says:  “I, Jacob, who speak to you, and
Israel, I am an angel of God, a ruling spirit, and Abraham and Isaac
were created before every work of God; and I am Jacob, called Jacob by
men, but my name is Israel, called Israel by God, a man seeing God,
because I am the first-born of every creature which God caused to
live.”  And he adds:  “When I was coming from Mesopotamia of Syria,
Uriel, the angel of God, came forth, and said, I have come down to the
earth and made my dwelling among men, and I am called Jacob by name.  He
was wroth with me and fought with me and wrestled against me, saying
that his name and the name of Him who is before every angel should be
before my name.  And I told him his name and how great he was among the
sons of God; Art not thou Uriel my eighth, and I am Israel and archangel
of the power of the Lord and a chief captain among the sons of God?  Am
not I Israel, the first minister in the sight of God, and I invoked my
God by the inextinguishable name?”  It is likely that this was really
said by Jacob, and was therefore written down, and that there is also a
deeper meaning in what we are told, “He supplanted his brother in the
womb.”  Consider whether the celebrated question about Jacob and Esau
has a solution.  We read, <span id="fr_4756"></span>[4757](#fn_4756.md)
“The children being not yet born, neither having done anything good or
bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of
works but of him that calleth, it was said, “The elder shall serve the
younger.”  Even as it is written:  “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” 
What shall we say, then?  Is there unrighteousness with God?  God
forbid.”  If, then, when they were not yet born, and had not done
anything either good or evil, in order that God’s purpose according to
election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth, if at such
a period this was said, how if we do not go back to the works done
before this life, can it be said that there is no unrighteousness with
God when the elder serves the younger and is hated (by God) before he
has done anything worthy of slavery or of hatred?  We have made
something of a digression in introducing this story about Jacob and
appealing to a writing which we cannot well treat with contempt; but it
certainly adds weight to our argument about John, to the effect that as
Isaiah’s voice declares <span id="fr_4757"></span>[4758](#fn_4757.md) he is
an angel who assumed a body for the sake of bearing witness to the
light.  So much about John considered as a man.
