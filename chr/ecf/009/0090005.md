<span id="iii.iii-p7"></span>24 ¶  When Pilate saw that he could prevail
nothing, but *that* rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed
*his* hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of
this just person:  see ye *to it*.

<span id="iii.iii-p8"></span>25  Then answered all the people, and said,
His blood *be* on us, and on our children.

<span id="iii.iii-p9"></span>\[*cf*. v. 57.\]

<span id="iii.iii-p10"></span>26 ¶  Then released he Barabbas unto
them:  and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered *him* to be
crucified.

<span id="iii.iii-p11"></span>27  Then the soldiers of the governor took
Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band *of
soldiers*.

<span id="iii.iii-p12"></span>28  And they stripped him, and put on him
a scarlet robe.

<span id="iii.iii-p13"></span>29 ¶  And when they had platted a crown of
thorns, they put *it* upon his head, and a reed in his right hand:  and
they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of
the Jews!

<span id="iii.iii-p14"></span>30  And they spit upon him, and took the
reed, and smote him on the head.

<span id="iii.iii-p18"></span>15 ¶  And *so* Pilate, willing to content
the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he
had scourged *him*, to be crucified.

<span id="iii.iii-p19"></span>16  And the soldiers led him away into the
hall, called Prætorium; and they call together the whole band.

<span id="iii.iii-p20"></span>17  And they clothed him with purple, and
platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his *head*,

<span id="iii.iii-p21"></span>18  And began to salute him, Hail, King of
the Jews!

<span id="iii.iii-p22"></span>19  And they smote him on the head with a

<span id="iii.iii-p36"></span>1  But of the Jews <span

taken, saying to them, What things soever I commanded you to do unto
them, do.

<span id="iii.iii-p40"></span>3  And there was come there Joseph the
friend of Pilate and of the Lord; and, knowing that they were about to
crucify him, he came to Pilate and asked the body of the Lord for
burial.  4  And Pilate sent to Herod and asked his body.  5  And Herod
said, Brother <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12) Pilate, even if no
one had asked for him, we purposed to bury him, especially as the
sabbath draweth on:  for it is written in the law, that the sun set not
upon one that hath been put to death.  And he delivered him to the
people on the day before the unleavened bread, their feast.

<span id="iii.iii-p42"></span>6  And they took the Lord and pushed him
as they ran, and said, Let us drag away the Son of God, having obtained
power over him.

<span id="iii.iii-p43"></span>7  And they clothed him with purple, and
set him on the seat of judgement, saying, Judge righteously, O King of
Israel.  8  And one of them brought a crown of thorns and put it on the
head of the Lord.  9  And others stood and spat in his eyes, and others
smote his cheeks:  others pricked him with a reed; and some scourged
him, saying, With this honour let us honour the Son of God.

<span id="iii.iii-p46"></span>31  And after that they had mocked him,
they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led
him away to crucify *him*.

<span id="iii.iii-p47"></span>32  And as they came out, they found a man
of Cyrene, Simon by name:  him they compelled to bear his cross.

<span id="iii.iii-p48"></span>33  And when they were come unto a place
called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,

<span id="iii.iii-p49"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p49.1"></span>Mark.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p50"></span>20  And when they had mocked him, they
took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led
him out to crucify him.

<span id="iii.iii-p51"></span>21  And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian,
who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and
Rufus, to bear his cross.

<span id="iii.iii-p52"></span>22  And they bring him unto the place
Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.

<span id="iii.iii-p53"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p53.1"></span>Luke.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p54"></span>26  And as they led him away, they laid
hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him
they laid the cross, that he might bear *it* after Jesus.

<span id="iii.iii-p55"></span>27 ¶  And there followed him a great
company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.

<span id="iii.iii-p56"></span>28  But Jesus turning unto them said,
Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and
for your children.

<span id="iii.iii-p57"></span>29  For, behold, the days are coming, in
the which they shall say, Blessed *are* the barren, and the wombs that
never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.

<span id="iii.iii-p58"></span>30  Then shall they begin to say to the
mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.

<span id="iii.iii-p59"></span>31  For if they do these things in a green
tree, what shall be done in the dry?

<span id="iii.iii-p60"></span>32  And there were also two other,
malefactors, led with him to be put to death.

<span id="iii.iii-p61"></span>33  And when they were come to the place,
which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors,
one on the right hand, and the other on the left.

<span id="iii.iii-p62"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p62.1"></span>John.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p63"></span>17  And he bearing his cross went forth
into a place called *the place* of a skull, which is called in the
Hebrew Golgotha:

<span id="iii.iii-p67"></span>34  ¶  They gave him vinegar to drink
mingled with gall:  and when he had tasted *thereof*, he would not
drink.

<span id="iii.iii-p68"></span>35  And they crucified him, and parted his
garments, casting lots:  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did
they cast lots.

<span id="iii.iii-p69"></span>36  And sitting down they watched him
there;

<span id="iii.iii-p70"></span>37  And set up over his head his
accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

<span id="iii.iii-p71"></span>38  Then were there two thieves crucified
with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.

<span id="iii.iii-p72"></span>39  ¶  And they that passed by reviled
him, wagging their heads,

<span id="iii.iii-p73"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p73.1"></span>Mark.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p74"></span>23  And they gave him to drink wine
mingled with myrrh:  but he received *it* not.

<span id="iii.iii-p75"></span>24  And when they had crucified him, they
parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.

<span id="iii.iii-p76"></span>25  And it was the third hour, and they
crucified him.

<span id="iii.iii-p77"></span>26  And the superscription of his
accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

<span id="iii.iii-p78"></span>27  And with him they crucify two thieves;
the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.

<span id="iii.iii-p79"></span>28  And the scripture was fulfilled, which
saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.

<span id="iii.iii-p80"></span><span class="sc"><span

<span id="iii.iii-p81"></span>34  ¶  Then said Jesus, Father, forgive
them; for they know not what they do.  And they parted his raiment, and
cast lots.

<span id="iii.iii-p82"></span>35  And the people stood beholding.  And
the rulers also with them derided *him*, saying, He saved others; let
him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.

<span id="iii.iii-p83"></span>36  And the soldiers also mocked him,
coming to him, and offering him vinegar,

<span id="iii.iii-p84"></span>37  And saying, If thou be the King of the
Jews, save thyself.

<span id="iii.iii-p85"></span>38  And a superscription also was written
over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF
THE JEWS.

<span id="iii.iii-p86"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p86.1"></span>John.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p87"></span>18  Where they crucified him, and two
other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.

<span id="iii.iii-p88"></span>\[*cf*. vv. 23, 24.\]

<span id="iii.iii-p89"></span>19  ¶  And Pilate wrote a title, and put
*it* on the cross.  And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF
THE JEWS.

<span id="iii.iii-p90"></span>20  This title then read many of the
Jews:  for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: 
and it was written in Hebrew, *and* Greek, *and* Latin.

they crucified the Lord between them.

<span id="iii.iii-p93"></span>But he held his peace, as though having no
pain.

<span id="iii.iii-p94"></span>11  And when they had raised the cross,
they wrote upon it, This is the King of Israel.

<span id="iii.iii-p95"></span>12  And having set his garments before
him, they parted them among them, and cast lots for them.

temple, and buildest *it* in three days, save thyself.  If thou be the
Son of God, come down from the cross.

<span id="iii.iii-p100"></span>41  Likewise also the chief priests
mocking *him*, with the scribes and elders, said,

<span id="iii.iii-p101"></span>42  He saved others; himself he cannot
save.  If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the
cross, and we will believe him.

<span id="iii.iii-p102"></span>43  He trusted in God; let him deliver
him now, if he will have him:  for he said, I am the Son of God.

<span id="iii.iii-p103"></span>\[*cf*. v. 35.\]

<span id="iii.iii-p104"></span>44  The thieves also, which were
crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.

<span id="iii.iii-p105"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p105.1"></span>Mark.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p106"></span>29  And they that passed by railed on

temple, and buildest *it* in three days,

<span id="iii.iii-p107"></span>30  Save thyself, and come down from the
cross.

<span id="iii.iii-p108"></span>31  Likewise also the chief priests
mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself
he cannot save.

<span id="iii.iii-p109"></span>32  Let Christ the King of Israel descend
now from the cross, that we may see and believe.

<span id="iii.iii-p110"></span>\[*cf*. v. 24.\]

<span id="iii.iii-p111"></span>And they that were crucified with him
reviled him.

<span id="iii.iii-p113"></span>39  ¶  And one of the malefactors which
were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and
us.

<span id="iii.iii-p114"></span>40  But the other answering rebuked him,
saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same
condemnation?

<span id="iii.iii-p115"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p115.1"></span>John.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p116"></span>21  Then said the chief priests of the
Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am
King of the Jews.

<span id="iii.iii-p117"></span>22  Pilate answered, What I have written
I have written.

<span id="iii.iii-p118"></span>23  ¶  Then the soldiers, when they had
crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every
soldier a part; and also *his* coat:  now the coat was without seam,
woven from the top throughout.

<span id="iii.iii-p119"></span>24  They said therefore among themselves,
Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be:  that the
scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among
them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.  These things therefore the
soldiers did.

reproached him, saying, We for the evils that we have done have suffered

darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.

with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say,
My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.

the due reward of our deeds:  but this man hath done nothing amiss.

<span id="iii.iii-p132"></span>42  And he said unto Jesus, Lord,
remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.

<span id="iii.iii-p133"></span>43  And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say
unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.

<span id="iii.iii-p134"></span>44  And it was about the sixth hour, and
there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.

<span id="iii.iii-p135"></span>45  And the sun was darkened, and the
veil of the temple was rent in the midst.

Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the *wife* of Cleophas,
and Mary Magdalene.

<span id="iii.iii-p138"></span>26  When Jesus therefore saw his mother,
and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother,
Woman, behold thy son!

<span id="iii.iii-p139"></span>27  Then saith he to the disciple, Behold
thy mother!  And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own

torment.

<span id="iii.iii-p142"></span>15  And it was noon, and darkness came
over all Judæa:

<span id="iii.iii-p143"></span>and they were troubled and distressed,
lest the sun had set, whilst he was yet alive:  \[for\] it is written

<span id="iii.iii-p150"></span>51  And, behold, the veil of the temple
was rent in twain from the top to the bottom;

rent;

<span id="iii.iii-p152"></span>52  And the graves were opened; and many
bodies of the saints which slept arose,

vinegar:  and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop,

<span id="iii.iii-p164"></span>30  When Jesus therefore had received the
vinegar, he said, It is finished:  and he bowed his head, and gave up
the ghost.

<span id="iii.iii-p165"></span>31  The Jews therefore, because it was
the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the
sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate
that their legs might be broken, and *that* they might be taken away.

<span id="iii.iii-p166"></span>32  Then came the soldiers, and brake the
legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.

<span id="iii.iii-p167"></span>33  But when they came to Jesus, and saw
that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:

<span id="iii.iii-p169"></span>16  And one of them said, Give him to
drink gall with vinegar.  And they mixed and gave him to drink, 17  and
fulfilled all things, and accomplished their sins against their own
head.

<span id="iii.iii-p170"></span>18  And many went about with lamps,
supposing that it was night, and fell down.  19  And the Lord cried out,
saying, My power, my power, thou hast forsaken me.

<span id="iii.iii-p171"></span>And when he had said it he was taken up.

<span id="iii.iii-p172"></span>20  And in that hour the vail of the
temple of Jerusalem was rent in twain.

id="iii.iii-p174.1"></span>Matthew.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p175"></span>54  Now when the centurion, and they that
were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that
were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

<span id="iii.iii-p176"></span>55  And many women were there beholding
afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:

<span id="iii.iii-p177"></span>56  Among which was Mary Magdalene, and
Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s
children.

<span id="iii.iii-p178"></span>57  When the even was come, there came a
rich man of Arimathæa, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’
disciple:

<span id="iii.iii-p179"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p179.1"></span>Mark.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p180"></span>39  ¶  And when the centurion, which
stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost,
he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.

<span id="iii.iii-p181"></span>40  There were also women looking on afar
off:  among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the
less and of Joses, and Salome;

<span id="iii.iii-p182"></span>41  (Who also, when he was in Galilee,
followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came
up with him unto Jerusalem.

<span id="iii.iii-p183"></span>42  ¶  And now when the even was come,
because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,

<span id="iii.iii-p184"></span>43  Joseph of Arimathæa, an honourable
counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in
boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.

<span id="iii.iii-p185"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p185.1"></span>Luke.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p186"></span>47  Now when the centurion saw what was
done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.

<span id="iii.iii-p187"></span>48  And all the people that came together
to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their
breasts, and returned.

<span id="iii.iii-p188"></span>49  And all his acquaintance, and the
women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these
things.

<span id="iii.iii-p189"></span>50  ¶  And, behold, *there was* a man
named Joseph, a counsellor; *and he was* a good man, and a just:

<span id="iii.iii-p190"></span>51  (The same had not consented to the
counsel and deed of them;) *he was* of Arimathæa, a city of the Jews: 
who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.

<span id="iii.iii-p191"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p191.1"></span>John.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p192"></span>34  But one of the soldiers with a spear
pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.

<span id="iii.iii-p193"></span>35  And he that saw it bare record, and
his record is true:  and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might
believe.

<span id="iii.iii-p194"></span>36  For these things were done, that the
scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.

<span id="iii.iii-p195"></span>37  And again another scripture saith,
They shall look on him whom they pierced.

<span id="iii.iii-p196"></span>38  ¶  And after this Joseph of
Arimathæa, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews,
besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus:  and Pilate
gave him leave.  He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.

<span id="iii.iii-p198"></span>21  And then they drew out the nails from
the hands of the Lord, and laid him upon the earth, and the whole earth
quaked, and great fear arose.  22  Then the sun shone, and it was found
the ninth hour:  23  and the Jews rejoiced, and

id="iii.iii-p200.1"></span>Matthew.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p201"></span>58  He went to Pilate, and begged the
body of Jesus.  Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.

<span id="iii.iii-p202"></span>59  And when Joseph had taken the body,
he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,

<span id="iii.iii-p203"></span>60  And laid it in his own new tomb,
which he had hewn out in the rock:  and he rolled a great stone to the
door of the sepulchre, and departed.

<span id="iii.iii-p204"></span>61  And there was Mary Magdalene, and the
other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.

<span id="iii.iii-p205"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p205.1"></span>Mark.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p206"></span>44  And Pilate marvelled if he were
already dead:  and calling *unto him* the centurion, he asked him
whether he had been any while dead.

<span id="iii.iii-p207"></span>45  And when he knew *it* of the
centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.

<span id="iii.iii-p208"></span>46  And he bought fine linen, and took
him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre
which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the
sepulchre.

<span id="iii.iii-p209"></span>47  And Mary Magdalene and Mary *the
mother* of Joses beheld where he was laid.

<span id="iii.iii-p210"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p210.1"></span>Luke.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p211"></span>52  This *man* went unto Pilate, and
begged the body of Jesus.

<span id="iii.iii-p212"></span>53  And he took it down, and wrapped it
in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein
never man before was laid.

<span id="iii.iii-p213"></span>54  And that day was the preparation, and
the sabbath drew on.

<span id="iii.iii-p214"></span>55  And the women also, which came with
him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his
body was laid.

<span id="iii.iii-p215"></span>56  And they returned, and prepared
spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the
commandment.

<span id="iii.iii-p216"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p216.1"></span>John.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p217"></span>39  And there came also Nicodemus, which
at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and
aloes, about an hundred pound *weight*.

<span id="iii.iii-p218"></span>40  Then took they the body of Jesus, and
wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is
to bury.

<span id="iii.iii-p219"></span>41  Now in the place where he was
crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein
was never man yet laid.

<span id="iii.iii-p220"></span>42  There laid they Jesus therefore
because of the Jews’ preparation *day*; for the sepulchre was nigh at
hand.

<span id="iii.iii-p221"></span><span id="page_25">p. 25</span> <span
id="iii.iii-Page_25"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p221.1"></span>Peter.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p222"></span>gave his body to Joseph that he might
bury it,

<span id="iii.iii-p223"></span>since he had seen what good things he had
done.

<span id="iii.iii-p224"></span>24  And he took the Lord, and washed him,
and wrapped him in a linen cloth, and brought him into his own tomb,

<span id="iii.iii-p225"></span>which was called the Garden of Joseph.

<span id="iii.iii-p226"></span>25  Then the Jews and the elders and the
priests, perceiving what evil they had done to themselves, began to
lament and to say, Woe for our sins:  the judgement hath drawn nigh, and
the end of Jerusalem.

<span id="iii.iii-p227"></span>26  And I with my companions was grieved;
and being wounded in mind we hid ourselves:  for we were being sought
for by them as malefactors, and as wishing to set fire to the temple.

<span id="iii.iii-p231"></span>62  ¶  Now the next day, that followed
the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees

<span id="iii.iii-p232"></span>came together unto Pilate,

<span id="iii.iii-p233"></span>63  Saying, Sir, we remember that that
deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise
again.

<span id="iii.iii-p234"></span>64  Command therefore that the sepulchre
be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and
steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead:  so
the last error shall be worse than the first.

<span id="iii.iii-p235"></span>65  Pilate said unto them, Ye have a
watch:  go your way, make *it* as sure as ye can.

<span id="iii.iii-p236"></span>66  So they went, and made the sepulchre
sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.

<span id="iii.iii-p243"></span>27  And upon all these things we
fasted <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13) and sat mourning <span
id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14) and weeping <span
id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15) night and day until the sabbath.

<span id="iii.iii-p247"></span>28  But the scribes and Pharisees and
elders being gathered together one with another, when they heard that
all the people murmured and beat their breasts, saying, If by his death
these most mighty signs have come to pass, see how just he is,—29  the
elders were afraid and

<span id="iii.iii-p248"></span>came to Pilate, beseeching him and
saying, 30  Give us soldiers, that we may guard his sepulchre for three
days, lest his disciples come and steal him away, and the people suppose
that he is risen from the dead and do us evil.

<span id="iii.iii-p249"></span>31  And Pilate gave them Petronius the
centurion with soldiers to guard the tomb.  And with them came the
elders and scribes to the sepulchre,

<span id="iii.iii-p250"></span>32  And having rolled a great stone
together with the centurion and the soldiers, they all together who were
there set it at the door of the sepulchre;

<span id="iii.iii-p251"></span>33  And they affixed seven seals, and
they pitched a tent there and guarded it.

<span id="iii.iii-p252"></span>34  And early in the morning as the
sabbath was drawing on, there came a multitude from Jerusalem and the
region round about, that they might see the sepulchre that was sealed.

<span id="iii.iii-p253"></span>35  And in the night in which the Lord’s
day was drawing on, as the soldiers kept guard two by two in a watch,
there was a great voice in the heaven; 36 and they saw the heavens
opened, and two men descend from thence with great light and approach
the tomb.  37  And that stone which was put at the door rolled of itself
and made way in part; and the tomb was opened, and both the young men
entered in.

<span id="iii.iii-p254"></span>38  When therefore those soldiers saw it,
they awakened the centurion and the elders,—for they too were hard by
keeping guard; 39  and, as they declared what things they had seen,
again they see three men coming forth from the tomb, and two of them
supporting one, and a cross following them.  40  And of the two the head
reached unto the heaven, but the head of him that was led by them
overpassed the heavens.  41  And they heard a voice from the heavens,
saying, Hast thou preached to them that sleep?  42  And a response was
heard from the cross, Yea.

<span id="iii.iii-p255"></span>43  They therefore considered one with
another whether to go away and shew these things to Pilate.  44  And
while they yet thought thereon, the heavens again are seen to open, and
a certain man to descend and enter into the sepulchre.  45  When the
centurion and they that were with him saw these things, they hastened in
the night to Pilate, leaving the tomb which they were watching, and
declared all things which they had seen, being greatly distressed and
saying, Truly he was the Son of God.

began to dawn toward the first *day* of the week, came Mary Magdalene
and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.

<span id="iii.iii-p261"></span>2  And, behold, there was a great
earthquake:  for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came
and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.

<span id="iii.iii-p262"></span>3  His countenance was like lightning,
and his raiment white as snow:

spices, that they might come and anoint him.

<span id="iii.iii-p266"></span>2  And very early in the morning the
first *day* of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of
the sun.

<span id="iii.iii-p267"></span>3  And they said among themselves, Who
shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?

<span id="iii.iii-p268"></span>4  And when they looked, they saw that
the stone was rolled away:  for it was very great.

<span id="iii.iii-p269"></span>5  And entering into the sepulchre,

<span id="iii.iii-p270"></span>they saw a young man sitting on the right
side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.

<span id="iii.iii-p274"></span>2  And they found the stone rolled away
from the sepulchre.

<span id="iii.iii-p275"></span>3  And they entered in, and found not the
body of the Lord Jesus.

<span id="iii.iii-p276"></span>4  And it came to pass, as they were much
perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:

<span id="iii.iii-p277"></span>5  And as they were afraid, and bowed
down *their* faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the

<span id="iii.iii-p281"></span>and seeth the stone taken away from the
sepulchre.

<span id="iii.iii-p283"></span>46  Pilate answered and said, I am pure
from the blood of the Son of God:  but ye determined this.

<span id="iii.iii-p284"></span>47  Then they all drew near and besought
him and entreated him to command the centurion and the soldiers to say
nothing of the things which they had seen:  48  For it is better, say
they, for us to incur the greatest sin before God, and not to fall into
the hands of the people of the Jews and to be stoned.  49  Pilate
therefore commanded the centurion and the soldiers to say nothing.

<span id="iii.iii-p285"></span>50  And at dawn upon the Lord’s day, Mary
Magdalen, a disciple of the Lord, fearing because of the Jews, since
they were burning with wrath, had not done at the Lord’s sepulchre the
things which the women are wont to do for those that die and for those
that are beloved by them—

<span id="iii.iii-p286"></span>51  she took her friends with her and
came to the sepulchre where he was laid.

<span id="iii.iii-p287"></span>52  And they feared lest the Jews should
see them, and they said, Although on the day on which he was crucified
we could not weep and lament, yet now let us do these things at his
sepulchre.

<span id="iii.iii-p288"></span>53  But who shall roll away for us the
stone that was laid at the door of the sepulchre, that we may enter in
and sit by him and do the things that are due?  54  For the stone was
great, and we fear lest some one see us.  And if we cannot, yet if we
but set at the door the things which we bring for a memorial of him, we
will weep and lament, until we come unto our home.

<span id="iii.iii-p289"></span>55  And they went away and found the tomb
opened,

<span id="iii.iii-p290"></span>and coming near they looked in there;

<span id="iii.iii-p291"></span>and they see there a certain young man
sitting in the midst of the tomb, beautiful and clothed in a robe
exceeding bright;

<span id="iii.iii-p294"></span>4  And for fear of him the keepers did
shake, and became as dead *men*.

<span id="iii.iii-p295"></span>5  And the angel answered and said unto
the women, Fear not ye:  for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was
crucified.

<span id="iii.iii-p296"></span>6  He is not here:  for he is risen, as
he said.  Come, see the place where the Lord lay.

<span id="iii.iii-p297"></span>7  And go quickly, and tell his disciples
that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into
Galilee; there shall ye see him:  lo, I have told you.

sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples
word.

and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee:  there shall ye see
him, as he said unto you.

<span id="iii.iii-p302"></span>8  And they went out quickly, and fled
from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed:  neither said
they any thing to any *man*; for they were afraid.

day rise again.

<span id="iii.iii-p307"></span>8  And they remembered his words,

<span id="iii.iii-p308"></span>9  And returned from the sepulchre, and
told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
