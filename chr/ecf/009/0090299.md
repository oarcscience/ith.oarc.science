<span id="xv.iii.v.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>23.  Heracleon’s View of This Utterance
of John the Baptist, and Interpretation of the Shoe of Jesus.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxiii-p2"></span>But Heracleon declares the words,
“There standeth one among you,” to be equivalent to “He is already here,
and He is in the world and in men, and He is already manifest to you
all.”  By this He does away with the meaning which is also present in
the words, that the Word had permeated the whole world.  For we must say
to him, When is He not present, and when is He not in the world?  Does
not this Gospel say, “He was in the world, and the world was made by
Him, and the world knew Him not.”  And this is why those to whom the
Logos is He “whom you know not,” do not know Him:  they have never gone
out of the world, but the world does not know Him.  But at what time did
He cease to be among men?  Was He not in Isaiah, when He said, <span
id="fr_4915"></span>[4916](#fn_4915) “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because He hath anointed me,” and <span
id="fr_4916"></span>[4917](#fn_4916) “I became manifest to those who
sought me not.”  Let them say, too, if He was not in David when he said,
not from himself, <span id="fr_4917"></span>[4918](#fn_4917) “But I was
established by Him a <span id="page_370">p. 370</span> <span
id="xv.iii.v.xxiii-Page_370"></span>king in Zion His holy hill,” and the
other words spoken in the Psalms in the person of Christ.  And why
should I go over the details of this proof, truly they are hard to be
numbered, when I can show quite clearly that He was always in men?  And
that is enough to show Heracleon’s interpretation of “There standeth in
the midst of you,” to be unsound, when he says it is equivalent to “He
is already here, and He is in the world and in men.”  We are disposed to
agree with him when he says that the words, “Who cometh after me,” show
John to be the forerunner of Christ, for he is in fact a kind of servant
running before his master.  The words, however, “Whose shoe-latchet I am
not worthy to unloose,” receive much too simple an interpretation when
it is said that “in these words the Baptist confesses that he is not
worthy even of the least honourable ministration to Christ.”  After this
interpretation he adds, not without sense, “I am not worthy that for my
sake He should come down from His greatness and should take flesh as His
footgear, concerning which I am not able to give any explanation or
description, nor to unloose the arrangement of it.”  In understanding
the world by his shoe, Heracleon shows some largeness of mind, but
immediately after he verges on impiety in declaring that all this is to
be understood of that person whom John here has in his mind.  For he
considers that it is the demiurge of the world who confesses by these
words that he is a lesser person than the Christ; and this is the height
of impiety.  For the Father who sent Him, He who is the God of the
living as Jesus Himself testifies, of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob,
and He who is greater than heaven and earth for the reason that He is
the Maker of them, He also alone is good and is greater than He who was
sent by Him.  And even if, as we said, Heracleon’s idea was a lofty one,
that the whole world was the shoe of Jesus, yet I think we ought not to
agree with him.  For how can it be harmonized with such a view, that
“Heaven is My throne and the earth My footstool,” a testimony which
Jesus accepts as said of the Father? <span
id="fr_4918"></span>[4919](#fn_4918)   “Swear not by heaven,” He says,
“for it is God’s throne, nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of
His feet.”  How, if he takes the whole world to be the shoe of Jesus,
can he also accept the text, <span id="fr_4919"></span>[4920](#fn_4919)
“Do not I fill heaven and earth?” saith the Lord.  It is also worth
while to enquire, whether as the Word and wisdom permeated the whole
world, and as the Father was in the Son, the words are to be understood
as above or in this way, that He who first of all was girded about with
the whole creation, in addition to the Son’s being in Him, granted to
the Saviour, as being second after Him and being God the Word, to
pervade the whole creation.  To those who have it in them to take note
of the uninterrupted movement of the great heaven, how it carries with
it from East to West so great a multitude of stars, to them most of all
it will seem needful to enquire what that force is, how great and of
what nature, which is present in the whole world.  For to pronounce that
force to be other than the Father and the Son, that perhaps might be
inconsistent with piety.
