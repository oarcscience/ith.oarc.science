<span id="xv.iii.ii.i"></span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.i-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.i-p1.1"></span>Book II.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.i-p2"></span>1.  “*And the Word was with God, and
the Word was God.*”  In the preceding section, my revered brother
Ambrosius, brother formed according to the Gospel, we have discussed, as
far as is at present in our power, what the Gospel is, and what is the
beginning in which the Word was, and what the Word is which was in the
beginning.  We now come to consider the next point in the work before
us, How the Word was with God.  To this end it will be of service to
remember that what is called the Word came to certain persons; as “The
Word of the Lord <span id="fr_4658"></span>[4659](#fn_4658.md) which came
to Hosea, the son of Beeri,” and “The Word <span
id="fr_4659"></span>[4660](#fn_4659.md) which came to Isaiah, the son of
Amos, concerning Judah and concerning Jerusalem,” and “The Word which
came to Jeremiah <span id="fr_4660"></span>[4661](#fn_4660.md) concerning
the drought.”  We must enquire how this Word came to Hosea, and how it
came also to Isaiah the son of Amos, and again to Jeremiah concerning
the drought; the comparison may enable us to find out how the Word was
with God.  The generality will simply look at what the prophets said, as
if that were the Word of the Lord or the Word, that came to them.  May
it not be, however, that as we say that this person comes to that, so
the Son, the Word, of whom we are now theologizing, came to Hosea, sent
to him by the Father; historically, that is to say, to the son of Beeri,
the prophet Hosea, but mystically to him who is saved, for Hosea means,
etymologically, *Saved*; and to the son of Beeri, which etymologically
means wells, since every one who is saved becomes a son of that spring
which gushes forth out of the depths, the wisdom of God.  And it is
nowise marvellous that the saint should be a son of wells.  From his
brave deeds he is often called a son, whether, from his works shining
before men, of light, or from his possessing the peace of God which
passes all understanding, of peace, or, once more, from the help which
wisdom brings him, a child of wisdom; for wisdom, <span
id="fr_4661"></span>[4662](#fn_4661.md) it says, is justified of her
children.  Thus he who by the divine spirit searches all things, and
even the deep things of God, so that he can exclaim, <span
id="fr_4662"></span>[4663](#fn_4662.md) “O the depth of the riches both of
the wisdom and the knowledge of God!” he can be a son of wells, to whom
the Word of the Lord comes.  Similarly the Word comes also to Isaiah,
teaching the things which are coming upon Judæa and Jerusalem in the
last days; and so also it comes to Jeremiah lifted up by a divine
elation.  For <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.i-p7.2"></span>Iao</span> means etymologically lifting up,
elation.  Now the Word comes to men who formerly could not receive the
advent of the Son of God who is the Word; but to God it does not come,
as if it had not been with Him before.  The Word was always with the
Father; and so it is said, “And the Word was with God.”  He did not come
to God, and this same word “was” is used of the Word because He was in
the beginning at the same time when He was with God, neither being
separated from the beginning nor being bereft of His Father.  And again,
neither did He come to be in the beginning after He had not been in it,
nor did He come to be with God after not having been with Him.  For
before all time and the remotest age <span
id="fr_4663"></span>[4664](#fn_4663.md) the Word was in the beginning, and
the Word was with God.  Thus to find out what is meant by the phrase,
“The Word was with God,” we have adduced the words used about the
prophets, how He came to Hosea, to Isaiah, to Jeremiah, and we have
noticed the difference, by no means accidental, between “became” and
“was.”  We have to add that in His coming to the prophets He illuminates
the prophets with the light of knowledge, causing them to see things
which had been before them, but which they had not understood till
then.  With God, however, He is God, just because <span id="page_323">p.
323</span> <span id="xv.iii.ii.i-Page_323"></span>He is with Him.  And
perhaps it was because he saw some such order in the Logos, that John
did not place the clause “The Word was God” before the clause “The Word
was with God.”  The series in which he places his different sentences
does not prevent the force of each axiom from being separately and fully
seen.  One axiom is, “In the beginning was the Word,” a second, “The
Word was with God,” and then comes, “And the Word was God.”  The
arrangement of the sentences might be thought to indicate an order; we
have first “In the beginning was the Word,” then, “And the Word was with
God,” and thirdly, “And the Word was God,” so that it might be seen that
the Word being with God makes Him God.
