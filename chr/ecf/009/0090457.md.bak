<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>16.  Why the Great are Compared to Little
Children.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xvi-p2"></span>But first we may expound it in simple
fashion.  One, expounding the word of the Saviour here after the simple
method, might say that, if any one who is a man mortifies the lusts of
manhood, putting to death by the spirit the deeds of the body, and
“always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus,” <span
id="fr_5926"></span>[5927](#fn_5926.md) to such a degree that he has the
condition of the little child who has not tasted sensual pleasures, and
has had no conception of the impulses of manhood, then such an one is
converted, and has become as the little children.  And the greater the
advance he has made towards the condition of the little children in
regard to such emotions, by so much the more as compared with those who
are in training and have not advanced to so great a height of
self-control, is he the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  But that
which has been said about little children in respect of lustful
pleasures, the same might also be said in regard to the rest of the
affections and infirmities and sicknesses of the soul, into which it is
not the nature of little children to fall, who have not yet fully
attained to the possession of reason; as, for example, that, if any one
be converted, and, though a man, such an one becomes as a child in
respect of anger; and, as is the child in relation to grief, so that
sometimes he laughs and plays at the very time that his father or mother
or brother is dead, he who is converted would become such an one as
little children; and, having received from the Word a disposition
incapable of grief, so that he becomes like the little child in regard
to grief.  And the like you will say about what is called pleasure, in
regard to which the wicked are irrationally lifted up, from which little
children do not suffer, nor such as have been converted and become as
little children.  As, then, it has been accurately demonstrated also by
others, that no passion is incident to the little children who have not
yet attained to full possession of reason; and if no passion, clearly
fear also; but, if there be anything corresponding to the passions,
these are faint, and very quickly suppressed, and healed in the case of
little children, so that he is worthy of love, who, being converted as
the little children, has reached such a point as to have, as it were,
his passions in subjection like the little children.  And with regard to
fear, therefore, similar things to those spoken might be conceived, that
the little children do not experience the fear of the wicked, but a
different thing, to which those who have an accurate knowledge of
questions in regard to the passions and their names give the name of
fear; as, for example, in the case of children there is a forgetfulness
of their evils at the very time of their tears, for they change in a
moment, and laugh and play along with those who were thought to grieve
and terrify them, but in truth had wrought in them no such emotion.  So
too, moreover, one will humble himself like the little child which Jesus
called; for neither haughtiness, nor conceit in respect of noble birth,
or wealth, or any of those things which are thought to be good, but are
not, comes to a little child.  Wherefore you may see those who are not
altogether infants, up to three or four years of age, like to those who
are of mean birth, though they may seem to be of noble birth, and not
appearing at all to love rich children rather than the poor.  If,
therefore, in the same way as according to their age children are
affected towards those passions which exalt the senseless, the disciple
of Jesus under the influence of reason <span
id="fr_5927"></span>[5928](#fn_5927.md) has humbled himself like the little
child which Jesus showed, not being exalted because of vainglory, nor
puffed up on the ground of wealth, or raiment, nor elated because of
noble birth, in particular are they to be received and imitated in the
name of Jesus, who have been converted as the Word showed, like the
little child which Jesus took to Him; since especially in such the
Christ is, and therefore He says, “Whosoever shall receive one such
little child in My name receiveth Me.” <span
