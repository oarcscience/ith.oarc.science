<span id="xvi.ii.v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.iii-p1.1"></span>3.  The Answer of Jesus to Their
Request.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.iii-p2"></span>Next let us remark in what way, when
asked in regard to one sign, that He might show it from heaven, to the
Pharisees and Sadducees who put the question, He answers and says, “*An
evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall be
no sign given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet,* ” when also,
“He left them and departed.” <span id="fr_5567"></span>[5568](#fn_5567.md)
  But the sign of Jonah, in truth, according to their question, was not
merely a sign but also a sign from heaven; so that even to those who
tempted Him and sought a sign from heaven He, nevertheless, out of His
own great goodness gave the sign.  For if, as Jonah passed three days
and three nights in the whale’s belly, so the Son of man did in the
heart of the earth, and after this rose up from it,—whence but from
heaven shall we say that the sign of the resurrection of Christ came? 
And especially when, at the time of the passion, He became a sign to the
robber who obtained favour from Him to enter into the paradise of God;
after this, I think, descending into Hades to the dead, “as free among
the dead.” <span id="fr_5568"></span>[5569](#fn_5568.md)   And the Saviour
seems to me to conjoin the sign which was to come from Himself with the
reason of the sign in regard to Jonah when He says, not merely that a
sign like to that is granted by Him but that very sign; for attend to
the words, “And there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah
the prophet.” <span id="fr_5569"></span>[5570](#fn_5569.md)   Accordingly
that sign was this sign, because that became indicative of this, so that
the elucidation of that sign, which was obscure on the face of it, might
be found in the fact that the Saviour suffered, and passed three days
and three nights in the heart of the earth.  At the same time also we
learn the general principle that, if the sign signifies something, each
of the signs which are recorded, whether as in actual history, or by way
of precept, is indicative of something afterwards fulfilled; as for
example, the sign of Jonah going out after three days from the whale’s
belly was indicative of the resurrection of our Saviour, rising after
three days and three nights from the dead; and that which is called
circumcision is the sign of that which is indicated by Paul in the
words:  “We are the circumcision.” <span
id="fr_5570"></span>[5571](#fn_5570.md)   Seek you also every sign in the
Old Scriptures as indicative of some passage in the New Scripture, and
that which is named a sign in the New Covenant as indicative of
something either in the age about to be, or even in the subsequent
generations after that the sign has taken place.
