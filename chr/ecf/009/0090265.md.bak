Relation of These Two to Each Other.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xxvi-p2"></span>Now we know voice and speech to be
different things.  The voice can be produced without any meaning and
with no speech in it, and similarly speech can be reported to the mind
without voice, as when we make mental excursions, within ourselves.  And
thus the Saviour is, in one view of Him, speech, and John differs from
Him; for as the Saviour is speech, John is voice.  John himself invites
me to take this view of him, for to those who asked who he was, he
answered, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the
way of the Lord! make His paths straight!”  This explains, perhaps, how
it was that Zacharias lost his voice at the birth of the voice which
points out the Word of God, and only recovered it when the voice,
forerunner of the Word, was born.  A voice must be perceived with the
ears if the mind is afterwards to receive the speech which the voice
indicates.  Hence, John is, in point of his birth, a little older than
Christ, for our voice comes to us before our speech.  But John also
points to Christ; for speech is brought forward by the voice.  And
Christ is baptized by John, though John declares himself to have need to
be baptized by Christ; for with men speech is purified by voice, though
the natural way is that speech should purify the voice which indicates
it.  In a word, when John points out Christ, it is man pointing out God,
the Saviour incorporeal, the voice pointing out the Word.
