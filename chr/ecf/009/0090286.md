<span id="xv.iii.v.x"></span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.x-p1.1"></span>10.  Of the Voice John the Baptist
is.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.x-p2"></span>“He said, I am the voice of one crying
in the wilderness:  Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah
the prophet.”  As He who is peculiarly the Son of God, being no other
than the Logos, yet makes use of Logos (reason)—for He was the Logos in
the beginning, and was with God, the Logos of God—so John, the servant
of that Logos, being, if we take the Scripture to mean what it says, no
other than a voice, yet uses his voice to point to the Logos.  He, then,
understanding in this way the prophecy about himself spoken by Isaiah
the prophet, says he is a voice, not crying in the wilderness, but “of
one crying in the wilderness,” of Him, namely, who stood and
cried, <span id="fr_4863"></span>[4864](#fn_4863.md) “If any man thirst,
let him come unto Me and drink.”  He it was, too, who said, <span
id="fr_4864"></span>[4865](#fn_4864.md) “Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
make His paths straight.  Every valley shall be filled and every
mountain and hill shall be brought low; and all the crooked shall be
made straight.”  For as we read in Exodus that God said to Moses, <span
id="fr_4865"></span>[4866](#fn_4865.md) “Behold I have given thee for a God
to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet;” so we are to
understand—the cases are at least analogous if not altogether similar—it
is with the Word in the beginning, who is God, and with John.  For
John’s voice points to that word and demonstrates it.  It is therefore a
very appropriate punishment that falls on Zacharias on his saying to the
angel, <span id="fr_4866"></span>[4867](#fn_4866.md) “Whereby shall I know
this?  For I am an old man and my wife well stricken in years.”  For his
want of faith with regard to the birth of the voice, he is himself
deprived of his voice, as the angel Gabriel says to him, “Behold, thou
shalt be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things
shall come to pass, because thou hast not believed my words, which shall
be fulfilled in their season.”  And afterwards when he had “asked for a
writing tablet and written, His name is John; and they all marvelled,”
he recovered his voice; for “his mouth was opened immediately and his
tongue, and he spake, blessing God.”  We discussed above how it is to be
understood that the Logos is the Son of God, and went over the ideas
connected with that; and a similar sequence of ideas is to be observed
at this point.  John came for a witness; he was a man sent from God to
bear witness of the light, that all men through him might believe; he
was that voice, then, we are to understand, which alone was fitted
worthily to announce the Logos.  We shall understand this aright if we
call to mind what was adduced in our exposition of the texts:  “That all
might believe through Him,” and “This is he of whom it is written,
Behold I send My messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way
before thee.” <span id="fr_4867"></span>[4868](#fn_4867.md)   There is
fitness, too, in his being said to be the voice, not of one saying in
the wilderness, but of one crying in the wilderness.  He who cries,
“Prepare ye the way of the Lord,” also says it; but he might say it
without crying it.  But he cries and shouts it, that even those may hear
who are at a distance from the speaker, and that even the deaf may
understand the greatness of the tidings, since it is announced in a
great voice; and he thus brings help, both to those who have departed
from God and to those who have lost the acuteness of their hearing. 
This, too, was the reason why “Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man
thirst, let him come unto Me and drink.”  Hence, too, <span
id="fr_4868"></span>[4869](#fn_4868.md) “John beareth witness of Him, and
cried, saying,” “Hence also God commands Isaiah to cry, with the voice
of one saying, Cry.  And I said, What shall I cry?”  The physical voice
we use in prayer need not be great nor startling; even should we not
lift up any great cry or shout, God will yet hear us.  He says to
Moses, <span id="fr_4869"></span>[4870](#fn_4869.md) “Why criest thou unto
Me?” when Moses had not cried audibly at all.  It is not recorded in
Exodus that he did so; but Moses had cried mightily to God in prayer
with that voice which is heard by God alone.  Hence David also
says, <span id="fr_4870"></span>[4871](#fn_4870.md) “With my voice I cried
unto the Lord, and He heard me.”  And one who cries in the desert has
need of a voice, that the soul which is deprived of God and deserted of
truth—and what more dreadful desert is there than a soul deserted of God
and of all virtue, since it still goes crookedly and needs
instruction—may be exhorted to make straight the way of the Lord.  And
that way is made straight by the man who, far from copying the serpent’s
crooked journey; while he who is of the contrary disposition perverts
his way.  Hence the rebuke directed to a man of this kind and to all who
resemble him, “Why pervert ye the right ways of the Lord?” <span
