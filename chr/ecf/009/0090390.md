<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>13.  The Offence of the
Pharisees.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xiii-p2"></span>And as in many cases we have to
consider the astonishment of the Jews at the words of the Saviour,
because they were spoken with authority, so also in regard to the words
in this place.  Having called the multitudes therefore, He said unto
them, “Hear and understand,” <span id="fr_5444"></span>[5445](#fn_5444.md)
etc.  And He said this, the Pharisees being offended at this saying, as,
because of their evil opinions and their worthless interpretation of the
law, they were not the plant of his own Father in heaven, and <span
id="page_442">p. 442</span> <span id="xvi.ii.iv.xiii-Page_442"></span>on
this account were being rooted up; <span
id="fr_5445"></span>[5446](#fn_5445.md) for they were rooted up as they did
not receive the true vine, which was cultivated by the Father, even
Jesus Christ. <span id="fr_5446"></span>[5447](#fn_5446.md)   For how could
they be a plant of His Father who were offended at the words of Jesus,
words which turn men away from the precept, “Handle not, nor taste, nor
touch,—all which things were to perish in the using—after the precepts
and doctrines of men,” <span id="fr_5447"></span>[5448](#fn_5447.md) but
induce the intelligent hearer of them to seek in regard to them the
things which are above and not the things upon the earth as the Jews
do? <span id="fr_5448"></span>[5449](#fn_5448.md)   And since, because of
their evil opinions, the Pharisees were not the plant of His Father in
heaven, on this account, as about such as were incorrigible, He says to
the disciple, “Let them alone;” <span
id="fr_5449"></span>[5450](#fn_5449.md) “Let them alone,” He said for this
reason, that as they were blind they ought to become conscious of their
blindness and seek guides; but they, being unconscious of their own
blindness, profess to guide the blind, not reckoning that they would
fall into a pit, about which it is written in the Psalms, “He hath made
a pit, and digged it, and will fall into the ditch which he hath
made.” <span id="fr_5450"></span>[5451](#fn_5450.md)   Again, elsewhere it
is written, “And seeing the multitudes, He went up into the mountain,
and when He had sat down His disciples came unto Him;” <span
id="fr_5451"></span>[5452](#fn_5451.md) but here He stretches forth His
hand to the multitude, calling them unto Him, and turning their thoughts
away from the literal interpretation of the questions in the law, when
He in the first place said to them, who did not yet understand what they
heard, “Hear and understand,” and thereafter as in parables said to
them, “Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man, but that
which proceedeth out of the mouth.” <span
id="fr_5452"></span>[5453](#fn_5452.md)
