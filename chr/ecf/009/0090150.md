id="xii.iv.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LV.—Examples of Such Love.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.lv-p2"></span>To bring forward some examples <span
id="fr_4292"></span>[4293](#fn_4292.md) from among the heathen:  Many kings
and princes, in times of pestilence, when they had been instructed by an
oracle, have given themselves up to death, in order that by their own
blood they might deliver their fellow-citizens \[from destruction\]. 
Many have gone forth from their own cities, that so sedition might be
brought to an end within them.  We know many among ourselves who have
given themselves up to bonds, in order that they might ransom others. 
Many, too, have surrendered themselves to slavery, that with the
price <span id="fr_4293"></span>[4294](#fn_4293.md) which they received for
themselves, they might provide food for others.  Many women also, being
strengthened by the grace of God, have performed numerous manly
exploits.  The blessed Judith, when her city was besieged, asked of the
elders permission to go forth into the camp of the strangers; and,
exposing herself to danger, she went out for the love which she bare to
her country and people then besieged; and the Lord delivered Holofernes
into the hands of a woman. <span id="fr_4294"></span>[4295](#fn_4294.md)  
Esther also, being perfect in faith, exposed herself to no less danger,
in order to deliver the twelve tribes of Israel from impending
destruction.  For with fasting and humiliation she entreated the
everlasting <span id="fr_4295"></span>[4296](#fn_4295.md) God, who seeth
all things; and He, perceiving the humility of her spirit, delivered the
people for whose sake she had encountered peril. <span
id="fr_4296"></span>[4297](#fn_4296.md)
