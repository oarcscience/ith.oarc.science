<span id="xv.iii.v.xi-p1"></span> <span id="page_360">p. 360</span>
<span id="xv.iii.v.xi-Page_360"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.xi-p1.1"></span>11.  Of the Way of the Lord, How It is
Narrow, and How Jesus is the Way.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xi-p2"></span>Now the way of the Lord is made
straight in two fashions.  First, in the way of contemplation, when
thought is made clear in truth without any mixture of falsehood; and
then in the way of conduct, after the sound contemplation of what ought
to be done, when action is produced which harmonizes with sound theory
of conduct.  And that we may the more clearly understand the text, “Make
straight the way of the Lord,” it will be well to compare with it what
is said in the Proverbs, <span id="fr_4872"></span>[4873](#fn_4872)
“Depart not, either to the right hand or to the left.”  For he who
deviates in either direction has given up keeping his path straight, and
is no longer worthy of regard, since he has gone apart from the
straightness of the journey, for “the Lord <span
id="fr_4873"></span>[4874](#fn_4873) is righteous, and loves
righteousness, and His face beholds straightness.”  Hence he who is the
object of regard, and receives the benefit that comes from this
oversight, says, <span id="fr_4874"></span>[4875](#fn_4874) “The light
of Thy countenance was shown upon us, O Lord.”  Let us stand, then, as
Jeremiah <span id="fr_4875"></span>[4876](#fn_4875) exhorts, upon the
ways, and let us see and ask after the ancient ways of the Lord, and let
us see which is the good way, and walk in it.  Thus did the Apostles
stand and ask for the ancient ways of the Lord; they asked the
Patriarchs and the Prophets, enquiring into their writings, and when
they came to understand these writings they saw the good way, namely,
Jesus Christ, who said, “I am the way,” and they walked in it.  For it
is a good way that leads the good man to the good father, the man who,
from the good treasure of his heart, brings forth good things, and who
is a good and faithful servant.  This way is narrow, indeed, for the
many cannot bear to walk in it and are lovers of their flesh; but it is
also hard-pressed <span id="fr_4876"></span>[4877](#fn_4876) by those
who use violence <span id="fr_4877"></span>[4878](#fn_4877) to walk in
it, for it is not called afflicting, but afflicted. <span
id="fr_4878"></span>[4879](#fn_4878)   For that way which is a living
way, and feels the qualities of those who tread it, is pressed and
afflicted, when he travels on it who has not taken off his shoes from
off his feet, <span id="fr_4879"></span>[4880](#fn_4879) nor truly
realized that the place on which he stands. or indeed treads, is holy
ground.  And it will lead to Him who is the life, and who says, “I am
the life.”  For the Saviour, in whom all virtues are combined, has many
aspects.  To him who, though by no means near the end, is yet advancing,
He is the way; to him who has put off all that is dead He is the life. 
He who travels on this way is told to take nothing with him on it, since
it provides bread and all that is necessary for life, enemies are
powerless on it, and he needs no staff, and since it is holy, he needs
no shoes.
