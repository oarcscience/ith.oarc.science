<span id="ix.ii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ii-p5.1"></span>The</span> Greek text of both the recensions of
this work is published for the first time in “Texts and Studies,” Vol.
II., No. 2 (Cambridge, 1892), by Montague Rhodes James, M.A.  None of
the manuscripts are older than the thirteenth century; of the six which
contain the longer version the best is a Paris <span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ii-p5.2"></span>ms</span>. written 1315, and the principal <span
class="sc"><span id="ix.ii-p5.3"></span>ms.</span> of the shorter
recension (also in Paris) belongs to the fifteenth century.  There are
also versions in Roumanian, Slavonic, Ethiopic, and Arabic.

<span id="ix.ii-p6"></span>The work itself has hitherto been little
noticed, and it is doubtful how far it was well known in ancient times. 
It is perhaps that cited as “Abraham” in early lists of Apocryphal
works, and some passages in early Christian writers may indicate their
knowledge of such a work.  The evidence for this is given in full by the
editor of the Greek text in his introduction (pp. 7–29).  The
conclusions drawn by him from these notices, and from the work itself,
are “that it was written in the second century, that it embodies legends
earlier than that century, that it received its present form perhaps in
the ninth or tenth century.”  Certain features in it also “seem to point
to Egypt as its birthplace,” such as the conception of Death in the
longer recension, which has parallels in the Coptic Apocryphal books,
the weighing of souls, and the presence of recording angels at the
judgment scene.

<span id="ix.ii-p7"></span>Neither of the two versions can be supposed
to be true copies of the original work.  They differ from each other not
only in length, but in arrangement.  The shorter recension may preserve
more of the original language, but it transposes certain sections,
thereby confusing the order of the narrative, and in this the Arabic
version generally agrees with it.  The most essential discrepancy begins
with Chap. X. of the longer recension, where Abraham, after being taken
up on the cloud, is first shown the iniquities that take place on
earth.  The shorter text places this at the end of his journey, quite
destroying the original moral of the writer, who wishes to emphasize the
mercy of God, and to show how Abraham’s righteous indignation is
replaced by feelings of compassion for the sinner.  The vision of
judgment is then altered in the shorter version, the doubtful soul being
there condemned, instead of being saved by the intercession of Abraham. 
In this point the editor thinks that the shorter recension may have been
influenced by the Apocalypse of Paul, as would also seem to be the case
with Michael’s reason for leaving Abraham in Chap. IV, which is quite
different from the pretext given in the longer text.  It is also
remarkable that in the shorter form there is no word. of Abraham’s
unwillingness to die, which is so prominent a feature of the other, and
is no doubt original, as the idea is not otherwise unknown in Apocryphal
literature.  The conclusion of the shorter version is very much
curtailed, compared with the longer one.

<span id="ix.ii-p8"></span>On account of these many differences between
the recensions of this remarkable work, it has been judged best to give
both of them entire, and so arranged that the reader can readily
discover in what respects the one differs from the other.

<span id="ix.ii-p9"></span>The tone of the work is perhaps rather Jewish
than Christian, but as phrases and conceptions of a New Testament
character appear in it, especially in the judgment scene, it is most
probably to be assigned to a Jewish Christian, who for the substance of
it drew partly on older legends, and partly on his own imagination. 
Some of its features are very striking, and a few of them do not seem to
occur elsewhere in literature of this class; it is possible that some of
these do not go further back than the medieval editors of the <span
id="page_184">p. 184</span> <span id="ix.ii-Page_184"></span>text. 
Among the most remarkable points may be noticed the age of Abraham,
variously given in different <span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ii-p9.1"></span>mss.</span>, his hospitality, and the sending of
Michael to announce his death (Chap. I.): Michael’s refusal to mount a
horse (Chap. II.):  the tree speaking with a human voice (Chap. III.);
the tears of Michael turning into precious stones (ibid.); and the
devouring spirit sent to consume the food for him (Chap. IV.).  In Chap.
VI. the narrative of Genesis is recalled by Sarah’s recognizing Michael
as one of the three who came to Abraham at the oak of Mamre, with the
added circumstance of the calf rising up whole after being eaten.  The
dream of Isaac in Chap. VII. is perhaps remotely suggested by that of
Joseph.  The whole vision of judgment, with the presence of Adam and
Abel, is very noteworthy, as also the conception of Death, and the
explanation of his various forms.
