<span id="xvi.ii.v.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xi-p1.1"></span>11.  The Promise Given to Peter Not
Restricted to Him, But Applicable to All Disciples Like Him.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xi-p2"></span>But if you suppose that upon that one
Peter only the whole church is built by God, what would you say about
John the son of thunder or each one of the Apostles?  Shall we otherwise
dare to say, that against Peter in particular the gates of Hades shall
not prevail, but that they shall prevail against the other Apostles and
the perfect?  Does not the saying previously made, “The gates of Hades
shall not prevail against it,” <span
id="fr_5622"></span>[5623](#fn_5622.md) hold in regard to all and in the
case of each of them?  And also the saying, “Upon this rock I will build
My church”? <span id="fr_5623"></span>[5624](#fn_5623.md)   Are the keys of
the kingdom of heaven given by the Lord to Peter only, and will no other
of the blessed receive them?  But if this promise, “I will give unto
thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven,” <span
id="fr_5624"></span>[5625](#fn_5624.md) be common to the others, how shall
not all the things previously spoken of, and the things which are
subjoined as having been addressed to Peter, be common to them?  For in
this place these words seem to be addressed as to Peter only,
“Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,” <span
id="fr_5625"></span>[5626](#fn_5625.md) etc.; but in the Gospel of John the
Saviour having given the Holy Spirit unto the disciples by breathing
upon them said, “Receive ye the Holy Spirit,” <span
id="fr_5626"></span>[5627](#fn_5626.md) etc.  Many then will say to the
Saviour, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God;” but not all
who say this will say it to Him, as not at all having learned it by the
revelation of flesh and blood but by the Father in heaven Himself taking
away the veil that lay upon their heart, in order that after this “with
unveiled face reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord” <span
id="fr_5627"></span>[5628](#fn_5627.md) they may speak through the Spirit
of God saying concerning Him, “Lord Jesus,” and to Him, “Thou art the
Christ, the Son of the living God.” <span
id="fr_5628"></span>[5629](#fn_5628.md)   And if any one says this to Him,
not by flesh and blood revealing it unto Him but through the Father in
heaven, he will obtain the things that were spoken according to the
letter of the Gospel to that Peter, but, as the spirit of the Gospel
teaches, to every one who becomes such as that Peter was.  For all bear
the surname of “rock” who are the imitators of Christ, that is, of the
spiritual rock which followed those who are being saved, <span
id="fr_5629"></span>[5630](#fn_5629.md) that they may drink from it the
spiritual draught.  But these bear the surname of the rock just as
Christ does.  But also as members of Christ deriving their surname from
Him they are called Christians, and from the rock, Peters.  And taking
occasion from these things you will say that the righteous bear the
surname of Christ who is Righteousness, and the wise of Christ who is
Wisdom. <span id="fr_5630"></span>[5631](#fn_5630.md)   And so in regard to
all His other names, you will apply them by way of surname to the
saints; and to all such the saying of the Saviour might be spoken, “Thou
art Peter,” etc., down to the words, “prevail against it.”  But what is
the “it”?  Is it the rock upon which Christ builds the church, or is it
the church?  For the phrase is ambiguous.  Or is it as if the rock and
the church were one and the same?  This I think to be true; for neither
against the rock on which Christ builds the church, nor against the
church will the gates of Hades prevail; just as the way of a serpent
upon a rock, according to what is written in the Proverbs, <span
id="fr_5631"></span>[5632](#fn_5631.md) cannot be found.  Now, if the gates
of Hades prevail against any one, such an one cannot be a rock upon
which Christ builds the church, nor the church built by <span
id="page_457">p. 457</span> <span id="xvi.ii.v.xi-Page_457"></span>Jesus
upon the rock; for the rock is inaccessible to the serpent, and it is
stronger than the gates of Hades which are opposing it, so that because
of its strength the gates of Hades do not prevail against it; but the
church, as a building of Christ who built His own house wisely upon the
rock, <span id="fr_5632"></span>[5633](#fn_5632.md) is incapable of
admitting the gates of Hades which prevail against every man who is
outside the rock and the church, but have no power against it.
