<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>11.  The Freedom of Sons.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xi-p2"></span>And this may be put in another way. 
There are some who are kings’ sons on the earth, and yet they are not
sons of those kings, but sons, and sons absolutely; but others, because
of their being strangers to the sons of the kings of the earth, and sons
of no one of those upon the earth, but on this very account are sons,
whether of God or of His Son, or of some one of those who are God’s. 
If, then, the Saviour inquires of Peter, saying, “The kings of the earth
from whom do they receive toll or tribute—from their own sons or from
strangers?” <span id="fr_5909"></span>[5910](#fn_5909.md) and Peter replies
not from their own sons, but “from strangers,” then Jesus says about
such as are strangers to the kings of the <span id="page_482">p.
482</span> <span id="xvi.ii.vi.xi-Page_482"></span>earth, and on account
of being free are sons, “Therefore the sons are free;” <span
id="fr_5910"></span>[5911](#fn_5910.md) for the sons of the kings of the
earth are not free, since “every one that committeth sin is the
bond-servant of sin,” <span id="fr_5911"></span>[5912](#fn_5911.md) but
they are free who abide in the truth of the word of God, and on this
account, know the truth, that they also may become free from sin.  If,
any one then, is a son simply, and not in this matter wholly a son of
the kings of the earth, he is free.  And nevertheless, though he is
free, he takes care not to offend even the kings of the earth, and their
sons, and those who receive the half-shekel; wherefore He says, “Let us
not cause them to stumble, but go thou and cast thy net, and take up the
fish that first cometh up,” <span id="fr_5912"></span>[5913](#fn_5912.md)
etc.  But I would inquire of those who are pleased to make myths about
different natures, of what sort of nature they were, whether the kings
of the earth, or their sons, or those who receive the half-shekel, whom
the Saviour does not wish to offend; it appears of a verity, *ex
hypothesi*, that they are not of a nature worthy of praise, and yet He
took heed not to cause them to stumble, and He prevents any
stumbling-block being put in their way, that they may not sin more
grievously, and that with a view to their being saved—if they will—even
by receiving Him who has spared them from being caused to stumble.  And
as in a place verily of consolation,—for such is, by interpretation,
Capernaum,—comforting the disciple as being both free and a son, He
gives to him the power of catching the fish first, that when it came up
Peter might be comforted by its coming up and being caught, and by the
stater being taken from its mouth, in order to be paid to those whose
the stater was, and who demanded as their own such a piece of money.
