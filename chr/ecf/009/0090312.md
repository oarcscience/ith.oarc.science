<span id="xv.iii.v.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>36.  Of the Death of the Martyrs
Considered as a Sacrifice, and in What Way It Operates to the Benefit of
Others.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxxvi-p2"></span>Akin to this sacrifice are the
others of which the sacrifices of the law are symbols, and another kind
of sacrifice also appears to me to be of the same nature; namely, the
shedding of the blood of the noble martyrs, whom the disciple John saw,
for this is not without significance, standing beside the heavenly
altar.  “Who is wise, <span id="fr_4963"></span>[4964](#fn_4963.md) and he
shall understand these things, prudent, and he shall know them?”  It is
a matter of higher speculation to consider even slightly the rationale
of those sacrifices which cleanse those for whom they are offered. 
Jephthah’s sacrifice of his daughter should receive attention; it was by
vowing it that he conquered the children of Ammon, and the victim
approved his vow, for when her father said, <span
id="fr_4964"></span>[4965](#fn_4964.md) “I have opened my mouth unto the
Lord against thee,” she answered, “If thou hast opened thy mouth unto
the Lord against me, do that which thou hast vowed.”  The story suggests
that the being must be a very cruel one to whom such sacrifices are
offered for the salvation of men; and we require some breadth of mind
and some ability to solve the difficulties raised against Providence, to
be able to account for such things and to see that they are mysteries
and exceed our human nature.  Then we shall say, <span
id="fr_4965"></span>[4966](#fn_4965.md) “Great are the judgments of God,
and hard to be described; for this cause untutored souls have gone
astray.”  Among the Gentiles, too, it is recorded that many a one, when
pestilential disease broke out in his country, offered himself a victim
for the public good.  That this was the case the faithful Clement
assumes, <span id="fr_4966"></span>[4967](#fn_4966.md) on the faith of the
narratives, to whom Paul bears witness when he says, <span
id="fr_4967"></span>[4968](#fn_4967.md) “With Clement also, and the others,
my fellow-labourers, whose names are in the book of life.”  If there is
anything in these narratives that appears incongruous to one who is
minded to carp at mysteries revealed to few, the same difficulty
attaches to the office that was laid on the martyrs, for it was God’s
will that we should rather endure all the dreadful reproaches connected
with confessing Him as God, than escape for a short time from such
sufferings (which men count evil) by allowing ourselves by our words to
conform to the will of the enemies of the truth.  We are, therefore, led
to believe that the powers of evil do suffer <span id="page_378">p.
378</span> <span id="xv.iii.v.xxxvi-Page_378"></span>defeat by the death
of the holy martyrs; as if their patience, their confession, even unto
death, and their zeal for piety blunted the edge of the onset of evil
powers against the sufferer, and their might being thus dulled and
exhausted, many others of those whom they had conquered raised their
heads and were set free from the weight with which the evil powers
formerly oppressed and injured them.  And even the martyrs themselves
are no longer involved in suffering, even though those agents which
formerly wrought ill to others are not exhausted; for he who has offered
such a sacrifice overcomes the power which opposed him, as I may show by
an illustration which is suited to this subject.  He who destroys a
poisonous animal, or lulls it to sleep with charms, or by any means
deprives it of its venom, he does good to many who would otherwise have
suffered from that animal had it not been destroyed, or charmed, or
emptied of its venom.  Moreover, if one of those who were formerly
bitten should come to know of this, and should be cured of his malady
and look upon the death of that which injured him, or tread on it, or
touch it when dead, or taste a part of it, then he, who was formerly a
sufferer, would owe cure and benefit to the destroyer of the poisonous
animal.  In some such way must we suppose the death of the most holy
martyrs to operate, many receiving benefit from it by an influence we
cannot describe.
