<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxx-p1.1"></span>30.  The Sinning Brother.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxx-p2"></span>“*If thy brother sin against thee,
go, shew him his fault between thee and him alone.* <span
id="fr_6015"></span>[6016](#fn_6015.md) ”  He, then, who attends closely to
the expression, in proof of the surpassing philanthropy of Jesus, will
say, that as the words do not suggest a difference of sins, they will
act in a singular manner and contrary to the goodness of Jesus, who
supply the thought, that these words are to be understood as being
limited in their application to lesser sins.  But another, also
attending closely to the expression, and not wishing to introduce these
extraneous thoughts, nor admitting that it is spoken about every sin,
will say, that he who commits those great sins is not a brother, even if
he be called a brother, as the Apostle says, “If any one that is named a
brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, etc., with such an
one not to eat;” <span id="fr_6016"></span>[6017](#fn_6016.md) for no one
who is an idolater, or a fornicator, or covetous, is a brother; for if
he, who seems to bear the name of Christ, though he is named a brother,
has something of the features of these, he would not rightly be called a
brother.  As then he, who says that such words are spoken about every
sin, whether the sin be murder, or poisoning, or pæderasty, or anything
of that sort, would give occasion of injury to the exceeding goodness of
Christ, so, on the contrary, he who distinguishes between the brother
and him who is called the brother, might teach that, in the case of the
least of the sins of men, he who has not repented after the telling of
the fault is to be reckoned as a Gentile and a publican, for sins which
are “not unto death,” <span id="fr_6017"></span>[6018](#fn_6017.md) or, as
the law has described them in the Book of Numbers, not
“death-bringing.” <span id="fr_6018"></span>[6019](#fn_6018.md)   This
would seem to be very harsh; for I do not think that any one will
readily be found who has not been censured thrice for the same form of
sin, say, reviling, with which revilers abuse their neighbours, or those
who are carried away by passion, or for over-drinking, or lying and idle
words, or any of those things which exist in the masses.  You will
inquire, therefore, whether any observation of the passage has escaped
the notice of those, who are influenced by their conception of the
goodness of the Word, and grant pardon to those who have committed the
greatest sins, as well as of those who teach that, in the case of the
very least sins, he is to be reckoned as a Gentile and a publican,
making him a stranger to the church, after he has committed three very
trivial transgressions.  But the following seems to me to have been
overlooked by both of them, namely, the words, “Thou hast gained thy
brother.” <span id="fr_6019"></span>[6020](#fn_6019.md)   It is assigned by
the Word to him only who heard, and He no longer applies it in the case
of him who has stumbled twice or thrice and been censured; but that
which was to be said about him who was censured twice or thrice,
corresponding to <span id="page_493">p. 493</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxx-Page_493"></span>the saying, “Thou hast gained thy
brother,” He has left in the air, so to speak.  He is not, therefore,
altogether gained, nor will he altogether perish, or he will receive
stripes.  And attend carefully to the first passage, “If he hear thee,
thou hast gained thy brother,” and to the second passage, which is
literally, “If he hear thee not, take with thyself one or two more, that
at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
established.” <span id="fr_6020"></span>[6021](#fn_6020.md)   What, then,
will happen to him who has been censured for the second time, after
every word has been established by two or three witnesses, He has left
us to conceive.  And, again, “If he refuse to hear them”—manifestly, the
witnesses who have been taken—“tell it,” he says, “to the church;” <span
id="fr_6021"></span>[6022](#fn_6021.md) and He does not say what he will
suffer if he does not hear the church, but He taught that if he refused
to hear the church, then he who had thrice admonished, and had not been
heard, was to regard him for the future as the Gentile and the
publican. <span id="fr_6022"></span>[6023](#fn_6022.md)   Therefore he is
not altogether gained, nor will he altogether perish.  But what at all
he will suffer, who at first did not hear, but required witnesses, or
even refused to hear these, but was brought to the church, God knows;
for we do not declare it, according to the precept, “Judge not that ye
be not judged,” <span id="fr_6023"></span>[6024](#fn_6023.md) “until the
Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness
and make manifest the counsels of the hearts.” <span
id="fr_6024"></span>[6025](#fn_6024.md)   But, with reference to the
seeming harshness in the case of those who have committed less sins, one
might say that it is not possible for him who has not heard twice in
succession to hear the third time, so as, on this account, no longer to
be as a Gentile or a publican, or no longer to stand in need of the
censure in presence of all the church.  For we must bear in mind this,
“So it is not the will of My Father in heaven that one of these little
ones should perish.” <span id="fr_6025"></span>[6026](#fn_6025.md)   For if
“we must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each one may
receive the things done in the body, according to what he hath done,
whether it be good or bad,” <span id="fr_6026"></span>[6027](#fn_6026.md)
let each one with all his power do what he can so that he may not
receive punishment for more evil things done in the body, even if he is
going to receive back for all the wrongs which he has done; but it
should be our ambition to procure the reward for a greater number of
good deeds, since “with what measure we mete, it shall be measured to
us,” <span id="fr_6027"></span>[6028](#fn_6027.md) and, “according to the
works of our own hands shall it happen unto us,” <span
id="fr_6028"></span>[6029](#fn_6028.md) and not in infinite wise, but
either double or sevenfold shall sinners receive for their sins from the
hand of the Lord; since He does not render unto any one according to the
works of his hands, but more than that which he has done, for
“Jerusalem,” as Isaiah taught, “received from the hand of the Lord
double for her sins;” <span id="fr_6029"></span>[6030](#fn_6029.md) but the
neighbours of Israel, whoever they may be, will receive sevenfold,
according to the following expression in the Psalms, “Render unto our
neighbours sevenfold into their bosom the reproach with which they have
reproached Thee, O Lord.” <span id="fr_6030"></span>[6031](#fn_6030.md)  
And other forms of payment in return could be found, which, if we
apprehend, we shall know that to repent after any sin, whatever its
greatness, is advantageous, in order that, in addition to our not being
punished for more offences, there may be some hope left to us concerning
good deeds done afterwards at some time, even though, before them,
thousands of errors have been committed by anyone of us.  For it would
be strange that evil deeds should be reckoned to any one, but the better
which are done after the bad should profit nothing; which may also be
learned from Ezekiel, <span id="fr_6031"></span>[6032](#fn_6031.md) by
those who pay careful consideration to the things said about such cases.
