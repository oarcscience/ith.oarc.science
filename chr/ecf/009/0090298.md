<span id="xv.iii.v.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>22.  How the Word Stands in the Midst of
Men Without Being Known of Them.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxii-p2"></span>As for the saying, “There standeth
one among you whom you know not,” we are led by it to consider the Son
of God, the Word, by whom all things were made, since He exists in
substance throughout the underlying nature of things, being the same as
wisdom.  For He permeated, from the beginning, all creation, so that
what is made at any time should be made through Him, and that it might
be always true of anything soever, that “All things were made by Him,
and without Him was not anything made that was made;” and this saying
also, “By wisdom didst thou make them all.”  Now, if He permeates all
creation, then He is also in those questioners who ask, “Why baptizest
thou, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”  In the
midst of them stands the Word, who is the same and steadfast, being
everywhere established by the Father.  Or the words, “There standeth
among you,” may be understood to say, In the midst of you men, because
you are reasonable beings, stands He who is proved by Scripture to be
the sovereign principle in the midst of every body, and so to be present
in your heart.  Those, therefore, who have the Word in the midst of
them, but who do not consider His nature, nor from what spring and
principle He came, nor how He gave them the nature they have, <span
id="fr_4913"></span>[4914](#fn_4913.md) these, while having Him in the
midst of them, know Him not.  But John knew Him:  for the words, “Whom
you know not,” used in reproach to the Pharisees, show that he well knew
the Word whom they did not know.  And the Baptist, therefore, knowing
Him, saw Him coming after himself, who was now in the midst of them,
that is to say, dwelling after him and the teaching he gave in his
baptism, in those who, according to reason (or the Word), submitted to
that purifying rite.  The word “after,” however, has not the same
meaning here as it has when Jesus commands us to come “after” Him; for
in this case we are bidden to go after Him, so that, treading in His
steps, we may come to the Father; but in the other case, the meaning is
that after the teachings of John (since “He came in order that all men
through Him might believe”), the Word dwells with those who have
prepared themselves, purified as they are by the lesser words for the
perfect Word.  Firstly, then, stands the Father, being without any
turning or change; and then stands also His Word, always carrying on His
work of salvation, and even when He is in the midst of men, not
comprehended, and not even seen.  He stands, also, teaching, and
inviting all to drink from His abundant spring, for <span
id="fr_4914"></span>[4915](#fn_4914.md) “Jesus stood and cried, saying, If
any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink.”
