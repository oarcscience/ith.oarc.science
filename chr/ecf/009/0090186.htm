<p class="Centered"><a name="xiii.iii-p5"></A> &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xiii.iii-p6"></A>I.&#160; I, O King in the providence of God came into the world; and when I had considered the heaven and the earth, the sun and the moon and the rest, I marvelled at their orderly arrangement.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p7"></A>And when I saw that the universe and all that is therein is moved by necessity, I perceived that the mover and controller is God.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p8"></A>For everything which causes motion is stronger than that which is moved, and that which controls is stronger than that which is controlled.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p9"></A>The self-same being, then, who first established and now controls the universe&#8212;him do I affirm to be God who is without beginning and without end, <A NAME="page_264"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 264</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_264"></A>immortal and self-sufficing, above all passions and infirmities, above anger and forgetfulness and ignorance and the rest.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p10"></A>Through Him too all things consist.&#160; He requires not sacrifice and libation nor anyone of the things that appear to sense; but all men stand in need of Him.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p11"></A>II.&#160; Having thus spoken concerning God, so far as it was possible for me to speak of Him,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4417"></A><A HREF="#fn_4417"><FONT SIZE="1">4418</FONT></A>
 let us next proceed to the human race, that we may see which of them participate in the truth and which of them in error.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p13"></A>For it is clear to us, O King,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4418"></A><A HREF="#fn_4418"><FONT SIZE="1">4419</FONT></A>
 that there are three&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4419"></A><A HREF="#fn_4419"><FONT SIZE="1">4420</FONT></A>
 classes of men in this world; these being the worshippers of the gods acknowledged among you, and Jews, and Christians.&#160; Further they who pay homage to many gods are themselves divided into three classes, Chald&aelig;ans namely, and Greeks, and Egyptians; for these have been guides and preceptors to the rest of the nations in the service and worship of these many-titled deities.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p16"></A><A NAME="page_265"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 265</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_265"></A>III.&#160; Let us see then which of them participate in truth and which of them in error.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p17"></A>The Chald&aelig;ans, then, not knowing God went astray after the elements and began to worship the creation more than their Creator.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p18"></A>And of these they formed certain shapes and styled them a representation of the heaven and the earth and the sea, of the sun too and the moon and the other primal bodies or luminaries.&#160; And they shut them up together in shrines, and worship them, calling them gods, even though they have to guard them securely for fear they should be stolen by robbers.&#160; And they did not perceive that anything which acts as guard is greater than that which is guarded, and that he who makes is greater than that which is made.&#160; For if their gods are unfit to look after their own safety, how shall they bestow protection upon others? Great <A NAME="page_266"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 266</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_266"></A>then is the error into which the Chald&aelig;ans wandered in adoring lifeless and good-for-nothing images.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p19"></A>And it occurs to me as surprising, O King, how it is that their so-called philosophers have quite failed to observe that the elements themselves are perishable.&#160; And if the elements are perishable and subject to necessity, how are they gods?&#160; And if the elements are not gods, how do the images made in their honour come to be gods?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p20"></A>IV.&#160; Let us proceed then, O King, to the elements themselves that we may show in regard to them that they are not gods, but perishable and mutable, produced out of that which did not exist at the command of the true God, who is indestructible and immutable and invisible; yet He sees all things and as He wills, modifies and changes things.&#160; What then shall I say concerning the elements?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p21"></A>They err who believe that the sky is a god.&#160; For we see that it revolves and moves by necessity and is compacted of many parts, being thence called the ordered universe (Kosmos).&#160; Now the universe is the construction of some designer; and that which has been constructed has a beginning and an end.&#160; And the sky with its luminaries moves by necessity.&#160; For the stars are carried along in array at fixed intervals from sign to sign, and, some setting, others rising, they traverse their courses in due season so as to mark off summers and winters, as it has been appointed for them by God; and obeying the inevitable necessity of their nature they transgress not their proper limits, keeping company with the heavenly order.&#160; Whence it is plain that the sky is not a god but rather a work of God.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p22"></A>They erred also who believed the earth to be a goddess.&#160; For we see that it is despitefully used and tyrannized over by men, and is furrowed and kneaded and becomes of no account.&#160; For, if it be burned with fire, it becomes devoid of life; for nothing will grow from the ashes.&#160; Besides if there fall upon it an excess of rain it dissolves away, <A NAME="page_267"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 267</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_267"></A>both it and its fruits.&#160; Moreover it is trodden under foot of men and the other creatures; it is dyed with the blood of the murdered; it is dug open and filled with dead bodies and becomes a tomb for corpses.&#160; In face of all this, it is inadmissible that the earth is a goddess but rather it is a work of God for the use of men.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p23"></A>V.&#160; They also erred who believed the water to be a god.&#160; For it, too, has been made for the use of men, and is controlled by them; it is defiled and destroyed and suffers change on being boiled and dyed with colours; and it is congealed by the frost, and polluted with blood, and is introduced for the washing of all unclean things.&#160; Wherefore it is impossible that water should be a god, but it is a work of God.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p24"></A>They also err who believe that fire is a god.&#160; For fire was made for the use of men, and it is controlled by them, being carried about from place to place for boiling and roasting all kinds of meat, and even for (the burning of) dead bodies.&#160; Moreover it is extinguished in many ways, being quenched through man&#146;s agency.&#160; So it cannot be allowed that fire is a god, but it is a work of God.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p25"></A>They also err who think the blowing of the winds is a goddess.&#160; For it is clear that it is under the dominion of another; and for the sake of man it has been designed by God for the transport of ships and the conveyance of grain and for man&#146;s other wants.&#160; It rises too and falls at the bidding of God, whence it is concluded that the blowing of the winds is not a goddess but only a work of God.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p26"></A>VI.&#160; They also err who believe the <A NAME="page_268"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 268</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_268"></A>sun to be a god.&#160; For we see that it moves by necessity and revolves and passes from sign to sign, setting and rising so as to give warmth to plants and tender shoots for the use of man.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p27"></A>Besides it has its part in common with the rest of the stars, and is much smaller than the sky; it suffers eclipse of its light and is not the subject of its own laws.&#160; Wherefore it is concluded that the sun is not a god, but only a work of God.&#160; They also err who believe that the moon is a goddess.&#160; For we see that it moves by necessity and revolves and passes from sign to sign, setting and rising for the benefit of men; and it is less than the sun and waxes and wanes and has eclipses.&#160; Wherefore it is concluded that the moon is not a goddess but a work of God.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p28"></A>VII.&#160; They also err who believe that man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4420"></A><A HREF="#fn_4420"><FONT SIZE="1">4421</FONT></A>
 is a god.&#160; For we see that he is moved by necessity, and is made to grow up, and becomes old even though he would not.&#160; And at one time he is joyous, at another he is grieved when he lacks food and drink and clothing.&#160; And we see that he is subject to anger and jealousy and desire and change of purpose and has many infirmities.&#160; He is destroyed too in many ways by means of the elements and animals, and by ever-assailing death.&#160; It cannot be admitted, then, that man is a god, but only a work of God.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p30"></A>Great therefore is the error into which the Chald&aelig;ans wandered, following after their own desires.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p31"></A>For they reverence the perishable elements and lifeless images, and do not perceive that they themselves make these things to be gods.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p32"></A>VIII.&#160; Let us proceed then to the Greeks, that we may see whether they have any discernment concerning God.&#160; The Greeks, indeed, though they call themselves wise proved more deluded than the Chald&aelig;ans in alleging that many gods have come into being, some of them <A NAME="page_269"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 269</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_269"></A>male, some female, practised masters in every passion and every variety of folly.&#160; [And the Greeks themselves represented them to be adulterers and murderers, wrathful and envious and passionate, slayers of fathers and brothers, thieves and robbers, crippled and limping, workers in magic, and victims of frenzy.&#160; Some of them died (as their account goes), and some were struck by thunderbolts, and became slaves to men, and were fugitives, and they mourned and lamented, and changed themselves into animals for wicked and shameful ends.]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4421"></A><A HREF="#fn_4421"><FONT SIZE="1">4422</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p34"></A>Wherefore, O King, they are ridiculous and absurd and impious tales that the Greeks have introduced, giving the name of gods to those who are not gods, to suit their unholy desires, in order that, having them as patrons of vice, they might commit adultery and robbery and do murder and other shocking deeds.&#160; For if their gods did such deeds why should not they also do them?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p35"></A>So that from these misguided practices it has been the lot of mankind to have frequent wars and slaughters and bitter captivities.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p36"></A>IX.&#160; But, further, if we be minded to discuss their gods individually, you will see how great is the absurdity; for instance, how Kronos is brought forward by them as a god above all, and they sacrifice their own children to him.&#160; And he had many sons by Rhea, and in his madness devoured his own offspring.&#160; And they say that Zeus cut off his members and cast them into the sea, whence Aphrodite is said in fable to be engendered.&#160; Zeus, then, having bound his own father, cast him <A NAME="page_270"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 270</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_270"></A>into Tartaros.&#160; You see the error and brutality which they advance against their god?&#160; Is it possible, then, that a god should be manacled and mutilated?&#160; What absurdity!&#160; Who with any wit would ever say so?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p37"></A>Next Zeus is introduced, and they say that he was king of their gods, and that he changed himself into animals that he might debauch mortal women.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p38"></A>For they allege that he transformed himself into a bull for Europe, and into gold for Danae, and into a swan for Leda, and into a satyr for Antiope, and into a thunderbolt for Semele.&#160; Then by these there were many children, Dionysos and Zethus and Amphion and Herakles and Apollo and Artemis and Perseus, Kastor and Helenes and Polydeukes and Minos and Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon, and the nine daughters whom they called the Muses.&#160; Then too they bring forward statements about the matter of Ganymedes.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p39"></A>Hence it happened, O King, to mankind to imitate all these things and to become adulterous men and lascivious women, and to be workers of other terrible iniquities, through the imitation of their god.&#160; Now how is it possible that a god should be an adulterer or an obscene person or a parricide?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p40"></A>X.&#160; Along with him, too, they bring forward one Hephaistos as a god, and they say that he is lame and wields a hammer and tongs, working as a smith for his living.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p41"></A>Is he then badly off?&#160; But it cannot be admitted that a god should be a cripple, and besides be dependent on mankind.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p42"></A>Then they bring forward Hermes as a god, representing him to be lust<A NAME="page_271"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 271</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_271"></A>ful, and a thief, and covetous, and a magician (and maimed) and an interpreter of language.&#160; But it cannot be admitted that such an one is a god.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p43"></A>They also bring forward Asklepios as a god who is a doctor and prepares drugs and compounds plasters for the sake of a living.&#160; For he was badly off.&#160; And afterwards he was struck, they say, with a thunderbolt by Zeus on account of Tyndareos, son of Lacedaimon; and so was killed.&#160; Now if Asklepios in spite of his divinity could not help himself when struck by lightning, how will he come to the rescue of others?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p44"></A>Again Ares is represented as a god, fond of strife and given to jealousy, and a lover of animals and other such things.&#160; And at last while corrupting Aphrodite, he was bound by the youthful Eros and by Hephaistos.&#160; How then was he a god who was subject to desire, and a warrior, and a prisoner and an adulterer?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p45"></A>They allege that Dionysos also is a god who holds nightly revels and teaches drunkenness, and carries off the neighbours&#146; wives, and goes mad and takes to flight.&#160; And at last he was put to death by the Titans.&#160; If then Dionysos could not save himself when he was being killed, and besides used to be mad, and drunk with wine, and a fugitive, how should he be a god?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p46"></A>They allege also that Herakles got drunk and went mad and cut the throats of his own children, then he was consumed by fire and so died. &#160;Now how should he be a god, who was drunk and a slayer of children and burned to death? or how will he come to the help of others, when he was unable to help himself?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p47"></A>XI.&#160; They represent Apollo also as a jealous god, and besides as the master of the bow and quiver, and sometimes of the lyre and flute, and as divining to men for pay?&#160; Can he then be very badly off?&#160; But it cannot be admitted that a god should be in want, and jealous, and a harping minstrel.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p48"></A><A NAME="page_272"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 272</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_272"></A>They represent Artemis also as his sister, who is a huntress and has a bow with a quiver; and she roams alone upon the hills with the dogs to hunt the stag or the wild boar.&#160; How then should such a woman, who hunts and roams with her dogs, be a divine being?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p49"></A>Even Aphrodite herself they affirm to be a goddess who is adulterous.&#160; For at one time she had Ares as a paramour, and at another time Anchises and again Adonis, whose death she also laments, feeling the want of her lover.&#160; And they say that she even went down to Hades to purchase back Adonis from Persephone.&#160; Did you ever see, O King, greater folly than this, to bring forward as a goddess one who is adulterous and given to weeping and wailing?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p50"></A>And they represent that Adonis is a hunter god, who came to a violent end, being wounded by a wild boar and having no power to help himself in his distress.&#160; How then will one who is adulterous and a hunter and mortal give himself any concern for mankind?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p51"></A>All this and much more of a like nature, and even far more disgraceful and offensive details, have the Greeks narrated, O King, concerning their gods;&#8212;details which it is not proper either to state or for a moment to remember.&#160; And hence mankind, taking an impulse from their gods, practised all lawlessness and brutality and impiety, polluting both earth and air by their awful deeds.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p52"></A>XII.&#160; The Egyptians, again, being <A NAME="page_273"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 273</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_273"></A>more stupid and witless than these have gone further astray than all the nations.&#160; For they were not content with the objects of worship of the Chald&aelig;ans and the Greeks, but in addition to these brought forward also brute creatures as gods, both land and water animals, and plants and herbs; and they were defiled with all madness and brutality more deeply than all the nations on the earth.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p53"></A>For originally they worshipped Isis, who had Osiris as brother and husband.&#160; He was slain by his own brother Typhon; and therefore Isis with Horos her son fled for refuge to Byblus in Syria, mourning for Osiris with bitter lamentation, until Horos grew up and slew Typhon.&#160; So that neither had Isis power to help her own brother and husband; nor could Osiris defend himself when he was being slain by Typhon; nor did Typhon, the slayer of his brother, when he was perishing at the hands of Horos and Isis, find means to rescue himself from death.&#160; And though they were revealed in their true character by such mishaps, they were believed to be very gods by the simple Egyptians, who were not satisfied even with these or the other deities of the nations, but brought forward also brute creatures as gods.&#160; For some of them worshipped the sheep, and some the goat; another tribe (worshipped) the bull and the pig; others again, the raven and the hawk, and the vulture and the eagle; and others the crocodile; and some the cat and the dog, and the wolf and the ape, and the dragon and the asp; and others the onion and the garlic and thorns and other created things.&#160; And the poor creatures do not perceive about all these that they are utterly helpless.&#160; For though they see their gods eaten by men of other tribes, and burnt as offerings and <A NAME="page_274"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 274</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_274"></A>slain as victims and mouldering in decay, they have not perceived that they are not gods.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p54"></A>XIII.&#160; So the Egyptians and the Chald&aelig;ans and the Greeks made a great error in bringing forward such beings as gods, and in making images of them, and in deifying dumb and senseless idols.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p55"></A>And I wonder how they saw their gods sawn out and hacked and docked by the workmen, and besides aging with time and falling to pieces, and being cast from metal, and yet did not discern concerning them that they were not gods.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p56"></A>For when they have no power to see to their own safety, how will they take forethought for men?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p57"></A>But further, the poets and philosophers, alike of the Chald&aelig;ans and the Greeks and the Egyptians, while they desired by their poems and writings to magnify the gods of their countries, rather revealed their shame, and laid it bare before all men.&#160; For if the body of man while consisting of many parts does not cast off any of its own members, but preserving an unbroken unity in all its members, is harmonious with itself, how shall variance and discord be so great in the nature of God?</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p58"></A>For if there had been a unity of nature among the gods, then one god ought not to have pursued or slain or injured another.&#160; And if the gods were pursued by gods, and slain, and kidnapped and struck with lightning by them, then there is no longer any unity of nature, but <A NAME="page_275"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 275</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_275"></A>divided counsels, all mischievous.&#160; So that not one of them is a god.&#160; It is clear then, O King, that all their discourse on the nature of the gods is an error.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p59"></A>But how did the wise and erudite men of the Greeks not observe that inasmuch as they make laws for themselves they are judged by their own laws?&#160; For if the laws are righteous, their gods are altogether unrighteous, as they have committed transgressions of laws, in slaying one another, and practising sorceries, and adultery and thefts and intercourse with males.&#160; If they were right in doing these things, then the laws are unrighteous, being framed contrary to the gods.&#160; Whereas in fact, the laws are good and just, commending what is good and forbidding what is bad.&#160; But the deeds of their gods are contrary to law.&#160; Their gods, therefore, are lawbreakers, and all liable to the punishment of death; and they are impious men who introduce such gods.&#160; For if the stories about them be mythical, the gods are nothing more than mere names; and if the stories be founded on nature, still they who did and suffered these things are no longer gods; and if the stories be allegorical, they are myths and nothing more.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p60"></A>It has been shown then, O King, that all these polytheistic objects of worship are the works of error and perdition.&#160; For it is not right to give the name of gods to beings which may be seen but cannot see; but one ought to reverence the invisible and all-seeing and all-creating God.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p61"></A>XIV.&#160; Let us proceed then, O King, to the Jews also, that we may see what truth there is in their view of God.&#160; For they were descendants of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and migrated to Egypt.&#160; And thence God brought them forth with a mighty hand and an uplifted arm through Moses, their lawgiver; and by many wonders and signs He made known His power to them.&#160; But even they <A NAME="page_276"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 276</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_276"></A>proved stubborn and ungrateful, and often served the idols of the nations, and put to death the prophets and just men who were sent to them.&#160; Then when the Son of God was pleased to come upon the earth, they received him with wanton violence and betrayed him into the hands of Pilate the Roman governor; and paying no respect to his good deeds and the countless miracles he wrought among them, they demanded a sentence of death by the cross.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p62"></A>And they perished by their own transgression; for to this day they worship the one God Almighty, but not according to knowledge.&#160; For they deny that Christ is the Son of God; and they are much like to the heathen, even although they may seem to make some approach to the truth from which they have removed themselves.&#160; So much for the Jews.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p63"></A>XV.&#160; Now the Christians&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4422"></A><A HREF="#fn_4422"><FONT SIZE="1">4423</FONT></A>
 trace their origin from the Lord Jesus Christ.&#160; And He is acknowledged by the Holy Spirit to be the son of the most high God, who came down from heaven for the salvation of men.&#160; And being born of a pure virgin, unbegotten and immaculate, He assumed flesh and revealed himself among men that He might recall them to Himself from their wandering after many gods.&#160; And having accomplished His wonderful dispensation, by a voluntary choice He tasted death on the cross, fulfilling an august dispensation.&#160; And after three days He came to life again and ascended into heaven.&#160; And if you would read, O King, you may judge the glory of His presence from the holy gospel writing, as it is called among themselves.&#160; He had twelve disciples, who after His ascension to heaven went forth into the provinces of the whole world, and declared His greatness.&#160; As for instance, one of them traversed the countries about us, proclaiming the doctrine of the truth.&#160; From this it is, that they who still observe the righteousness enjoined by their preaching are called Christians.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p65"></A>And these are they who more than <A NAME="page_277"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 277</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_277"></A>all the nations on the earth have found the truth.&#160; For they know God, the Creator and Fashioner of all things through the only-begotten Son and the Holy Spirit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4423"></A><A HREF="#fn_4423"><FONT SIZE="1">4424</FONT></A>
; and beside Him they worship no other God.&#160; They have the commands of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself graven upon their hearts; and they observe them, looking forward to the resurrection of the dead and life in the world to come.&#160; They do not commit adultery nor fornication, nor bear false witness, nor covet the things of others; they honour father and mother, and love their neighbours; they judge justly, and they never do to others what they would not wish to happen to themselves; they appeal to those who injure them, and try to win them as friends; they are eager to do good to their enemies; they are gentle and easy to be entreated; they abstain from all unlawful conversation and from all impurity; they despise not the widow, nor oppress the orphan; and he that has, gives ungrudgingly for the maintenance of him who has not.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p67"></A>If they see a stranger, they take him under their roof, and rejoice over him as over a very brother; for they call themselves brethren not after the flesh but after the spirit.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p68"></A>And they are ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of Christ; for they observe His commands without swerving, and live holy and just lives, as the Lord God enjoined upon them.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p69"></A>And they give thanks unto Him every hour, for all meat and drink and other blessings.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p70"></A><A NAME="page_278"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 278</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_278"></A>XVI.&#160; Verily then, this is the way of the truth which leads those who travel therein to the everlasting kingdom promised through Christ in the life to come.&#160; And that you may know, O King, that in saying these things I do not speak at my own instance, if you deign to look into the writings of the Christians, you will find that I state nothing beyond the truth.&#160; Rightly then, did thy son&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4424"></A><A HREF="#fn_4424"><FONT SIZE="1">4425</FONT></A>
 apprehend, and justly was he taught to serve the living God and to be saved for the age that is destined to come upon us.&#160; For great and wonderful are the sayings and deeds of the Christians; for they speak not the words of men but those of God.&#160; But the rest of the nations go astray and <A NAME="page_279"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 279</FONT></A> <a name="xiii.iii-Page_279"></A>deceive themselves; for they walk in darkness and bruise themselves like drunken men.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xiii.iii-p72"></A>XVII.&#160; Thus far, O King, extends my discourse to you, which has been dictated in my mind by the Truth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4425"></A><A HREF="#fn_4425"><FONT SIZE="1">4426</FONT></A>
&#160; Wherefore let thy foolish sages cease their idle talk against the Lord; for it is profitable for you to worship God the Creator, and to give ear to His incorruptible words, that ye may escape from condemnation and punishment, and be found to be heirs of life everlasting.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xiii.iii-p12"></A> The Greek might be rendered, &#8220;so far as there was room for me to speak of Him,&#8221; i.e., the attributes of the Deity are not further relevant to the discussion&#8212;as the translator into Syriac takes it.&#160; The Armenian adopts the other meaning, viz., the theme is beyond man&#146;s power to discuss.&#160; As translated by F. C. Conybeare, the Armenian is in these words:&#160; &#8220;Now by the grace of God it was given me to speak wisely concerning Him.&#160; So far as I have received the faculty I will speak, yet not according to the measure of the inscrutability of His greatness shall I be able to do so, but by faith alone do I glorify and adore Him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="fn_4418"></A><A HREF="0090186.htm#fr_4418">264:4419</A> <a name="xiii.iii-p13.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="xiii.iii-p14"></A> The &#8220;King&#8221; in the Greek is Abenner, the father of Josaphat; in the Syriac, as in the Greek originally, he is the Roman Emperor, Hadrian.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xiii.iii-p15"></A> The Armenian and Syriac agree in giving four races, which was probably the original division.&#160; To a Greek, men were either Greeks or Barbarians; to a Greek Christian it would seem necessary to add two new peoples, Jews and Christians.&#160; The Greek calls the Barbarians &#8220;Chald&aelig;ans.&#8221;&#160; This change of classification is probably the cause of the omission in the Greek of the preliminary accounts of the four classes.&#160; The Greek blends the summaries with the fuller accounts.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xiii.iii-p29"></A> &#8220;I do not think it out of place here to mention Antinous of our day [a slave of the Emperor Hadrian], whom all, not withstanding they knew who and whence he was, yet affected to worship as a god.&#8221;&#8212;Justin Martyr quoted in Eusebius Hist. Bk. IV., c. 8.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xiii.iii-p33"></A> The passage in brackets occurs earlier in &#8220;Barlaam and Josaphat,&#8221; and is restored to its place by J. A. Robinson.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xiii.iii-p64"></A> This, the &#8220;Christological&#8221; passage, occurs earlier in the Syriac.&#160; Chap. II.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xiii.iii-p66"></A> The Armenian agrees with the Greek against the Syriac.&#160; &#8220;Un&aacute; cum Spiritu Sancto&#8221; Arm.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xiii.iii-p71"></A> The reference is to Josaphat, son of Abenner, who was taught to be a Christian by the monk Barlaam.</p>
<A NAME="fn_4425"></A><A HREF="0090186.htm#fr_4425">279:4426</A> <a name="xiii.iii-p72.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="xiii.iii-p73"></A> Nachor, the fictitious monk who represented Barlaam, intended to make a weak defence of Christianity, but, according to the story, he was constrained to speak what he had not intended.&#160; It is evidently the author&#146;s intention to make it an instance of &#8220;suggestio verborum&#8221; or plenary inspiration, in the case of the fictitious monk.</p>
