<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxxii-p1.1"></span>32.  Standing by the Saviour.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxii-p2"></span>The reflections in regard to the
passage before us that occur to us at the present time are these:  Some
were standing where Jesus was, having the footsteps of the soul firmly
planted with Jesus, and the standing of their feet was akin to the
standing of which Moses said in the passage, “And I stood on the
mountain forty days and forty nights,” <span
id="fr_5759"></span>[5760](#fn_5759) who was deemed worthy to have it
said to him by God who asked him to stand by Him, “But stand thou here
with Me.” <span id="fr_5760"></span>[5761](#fn_5760)   Those who really
stand by Jesus—that is, by the Word of God—do not all stand equally; for
among those who stand by Jesus are differences from each other. 
Wherefore, not all who stand by the Saviour, but some of them as
standing better, do not taste of death until they shall have seen the
Word who dwelt with men, and on that account called Son of man, coming
in His own kingdom; for Jesus does not always come in His own kingdom
when He comes, since to the newly initiated He is such that they might
say, beholding the Word Himself not glorious nor great, but inferior to
many among them, “We saw Him, and He had no form or beauty, but His form
was dishonoured, defective compared with all the sons of men.” <span
id="fr_5761"></span>[5762](#fn_5761)   And these things will be said by
those who beheld His glory in connection with their own former times,
when at first the Word as understood in the synagogue had no form nor
beauty to them.  To the Word, therefore, who has assumed most manifestly
the power above all words, there belongs a royal dignity which is
visible to some of those who stand by Jesus, when they have been able to
follow Him as He goes before them and ascends to the lofty mountain of
His own manifestation.  And of this honour some of those who stand by
Jesus are deemed worthy if they be either a Peter against whom the gates
of Hades do not prevail, or the sons of thunder, <span
id="fr_5762"></span>[5763](#fn_5762) and are begotten of the mighty
voice of God who thunders and cries aloud from heaven great things to
those who have ears and are wise.  Such at least do not taste death.
