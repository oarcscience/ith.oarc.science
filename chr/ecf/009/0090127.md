<span id="xii.iv.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—We are Justified Not by Our
Own Works, But by Faith.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xxxii-p2"></span>Whosoever will candidly consider each
particular, will recognise the greatness of the gifts which were given
by him. <span id="fr_4154"></span>[4155](#fn_4154.md)   For from him <span
id="fr_4155"></span>[4156](#fn_4155.md) have sprung the priests and all the
Levites who minister at the altar of God.  From him also \[was
descended\] our Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh. <span
id="fr_4156"></span>[4157](#fn_4156.md)   From him \[arose\] kings,
princes, and rulers of the race of Judah.  Nor are his other tribes in
small glory, <span id="fr_4157"></span>[4158](#fn_4157.md) inasmuch as God
had promised, “Thy seed shall be as the stars of heaven.” <span
id="fr_4158"></span>[4159](#fn_4158.md)   All these, therefore, were highly
honoured, and made great, not for their own sake, or for their own
works, or for the righteousness which they wrought, but through the
operation of His will.  And we, too, being called by His will <span
id="fr_4159"></span>[4160](#fn_4159.md) in Christ Jesus, are not justified
by ourselves, nor by our own wisdom, or understanding, or godliness, or
works which we have wrought in holiness of heart; but by that faith
through which, from the beginning, Almighty God has justified all men;
to whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.

Some translate, “the gifts which were given to Jacob by Him,” *i.e*.
God.
