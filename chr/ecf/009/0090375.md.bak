<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>24.  The Diverse Forms of Spiritual
Sickness.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xxiv-p2"></span>And, if you wish to see of what
nature are the sicknesses of the soul, contemplate with me the lovers of
money, and the lovers of ambition, and the lovers of boys, and if any be
fond of women; for these also beholding among the crowds and taking
compassion upon them, He healed.  For not every sin is to be considered
a sickness, but that which has settled down in the whole soul.  For so
you may see the lovers of money wholly intent on money and upon
preserving and gathering it, the lovers of ambition wholly intent on a
little glory, for they gape for praise from the masses and the vulgar;
and analogously you will understand in the case of the rest which we
have named, and if there be any other like to them.  Since, then, when
expounding the words, “He healed their sick,” <span
id="fr_5329"></span>[5330](#fn_5329.md) we said that not every sin is a
sickness, it is fitting to discuss from the Scripture the difference of
these.  The Apostle indeed says, writing to the Corinthians who had
diverse sicknesses, “For this cause many among you are weak and sickly,
and not a few sleep.” <span id="fr_5330"></span>[5331](#fn_5330.md)   Hear
Him in these words, knitting a band and making it plaited of different
sins, according as some are weak, and others sickly more than weak, and
others, in comparison with both, are asleep.  For some, because of
impotence of soul, having a tendency to slip into any sin whatever,
although they may not be wholly in the grasp of any form of sin, as the
sickly are, are only weak; but others who, instead of loving God “with
all their soul and all their heart and all their mind,” love money, or a
little glory, or wife, or children, are suffering from something worse
than weakness, and are sickly.  And those who sleep are those who, when
they ought to be taking heed and watching with the soul, are not doing
this, but by reason of great want of attention are nodding in resolution
and are drowsy in their reflections, such as “in their dreamings defile
the flesh, and set at naught that which is highest in authority, and
rail at dignities.” <span id="fr_5331"></span>[5332](#fn_5331.md)   And
these, because they are asleep, live in an atmosphere of vain and
dream-like fancies concerning realities, not admitting the things which
are actually true, but deceived by what appears in their vain
imaginations, in regard to whom it is said in Isaiah, “Like as when a
thirsty man dreams that he is drinking, but when he has risen up is
still thirsty, and his soul has cherished a vain hope, so shall be the
wealth of all the nations as many as have warred in Jerusalem.” <span
id="fr_5332"></span>[5333](#fn_5332.md)   If, then, we have seemed to make
a digression in recounting the difference between the weak and the
sickly and those that sleep, because of that which the Apostle said in
the letter to the Corinthians which we have expounded, we have made the
digression in our desire to represent what is meant to be understood by
the saying, “And He healed their sick.” <span
