<span id="xiv.ii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.ii-p5.1"></span>The</span> Scillitan Martyrs were condemned and
executed at Carthage on the 17th July, <span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.ii-p5.2"></span>a.d.</span> 180.  The martyrs belonged to Scili,
a place in that part of Numidia which belonged to proconsular Africa. 
The proconsul at the time, who is said by Tertullian to have been the
first to draw the sword against the Christians there, was P. Vigellius
Saturninus.  The consuls for the year were Præsens II. and Condianus. 
Marcus Aurelius had died only a few months before.

<span id="xiv.ii-p6"></span>The exact date of the martyrdom was long
under dispute, and the question has recently arisen whether the Acts
were originally written in Latin or Greek.  Baronius placed the date as
late as 202.  The text had become corrupt in passing through various
Latin and Greek versions and transcriptions, and it was long impossible
to recognize the names of the consuls for the year in the first line of
the piece.  But M. Leon Renier conjectured that the word *bis* pointed
to a consul’s name underlying the word preceding it, and suggested the
year 180, when Præsens and Condianus were consuls.  This conjecture was
confirmed by Usener’s publication in 1881 of a Greek version from a
ninth century <span class="sc"><span id="xiv.ii-p6.1"></span>ms.</span>
in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris, though even here the names,
though recognizable, were in a corrupt form.  Usener believed this
version to be a translation from a Latin original, and his theory has
been confirmed by Mr. Armitage Robinson’s discovery of a Latin <span
class="sc"><span id="xiv.ii-p6.2"></span>ms.</span> of the ninth century
in the British Museum, containing the Acts of the Scillitan Martyrs in a
form briefer than any of the other versions and believed to be the
original.  Mr. A. Robinson’s translation which follows, is from the
Latin which he discovered, and which is printed in *Texts and Studies*,
vol. i., No. 2.
