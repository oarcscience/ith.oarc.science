<span id="xvi.ii.v.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xl-p1.1"></span>40.  Discussion of the Saying of
Peter.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xl-p2"></span>But let us next see what was the
thought of Peter when he answered and said to Jesus, “*Lord, it is good
for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles,*” <span
id="fr_5790"></span>[5791](#fn_5790) etc.  And on this account these
words call for very special examination, because Mark, in his own
person, has added, “For he wist not what to answer,” <span
id="fr_5791"></span>[5792](#fn_5791) but Luke, “not knowing,” he says,
“what he spake.” <span id="fr_5792"></span>[5793](#fn_5792)   You will
consider, therefore, if he spake these things as in a trance, being
filled with the spirit which moved him to say these things, which could
not be a Holy Spirit; for John taught in the Gospel that, before the
resurrection of the Saviour, no one had the Holy Spirit, saying, “For
the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” <span
id="fr_5793"></span>[5794](#fn_5793)   But if the Spirit was not yet,
and he, not knowing what he said, spoke under the influence of some
spirit, the spirit which caused these things to be said was some one of
the spirits which had not yet been triumphed over in the cross, nor made
a show of along with them, about whom it is written, “Having put off
from Himself the principalities and the powers, He made a show of them
openly, triumphing over them in the cross.” <span
id="fr_5794"></span>[5795](#fn_5794)   But this spirit was perhaps that
which is called a stumbling-block by Jesus, and which is spoken of as
Satan in the passage, “Get thee behind Me, Satan; thou art a
stumbling-block unto me.” <span id="fr_5795"></span>[5796](#fn_5795)  
But I know well that such things will offend many who meet with them,
because they think that it is opposed to sound reason that he should be
spoken ill of who a little before had been pronounced blessed by Jesus,
on the ground that the Father in heaven had revealed to him the things
concerning the Saviour, to-wit, that He was verily Jesus, and the
Christ, and the Son of the living God.  But let such an one attend more
exactly to the statements about Peter and the rest of the Apostles, how
even they made requests as if they were yet alien from Him who was to
redeem them from the enemy and purchase them with His own precious
blood; or let them also, who will have it that even before the passion
of Jesus the Apostles were perfect, tell us whence it came about that
“Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep.” <span
id="fr_5796"></span>[5797](#fn_5796)   But to anticipate something else
of what follows and apply it to the subject in hand, I would raise in
turn these questions,—whether it is possible for any one to find
occasion of stumbling in Jesus apart from the working of the devil who
caused him to stumble; and whether it is possible for any one to deny
Jesus, and that in presence of a little maid and a doorkeeper and men
most worthless, unless a spirit had been with him in his denial hostile
to the Spirit which is given and the wisdom, (which is given) to those
who are assisted by God to make confession, according to a certain
desert of theirs.  But he who has learned to refer the roots of sin to
the father of sin, the devil, will not say that apart from him either
the Apostles were caused to stumble, or that Peter denied Christ thrice
before that well-known cock-crowing.  But if this be so, consider
whether perhaps with a view to make Jesus stumble, so far as was in his
power, and to turn Him aside from the dispensation whose characteristic
was suffering that brought salvation to men, which He undertook with
great willingness, seeking to effect these things which seemed to
contribute to this end, he himself also here wishes as it were, by
deceit, to draw away Jesus, as if calling upon Him no longer to
condescend to men, and come to them, and undergo death for them, but to
abide on the high mountain with Moses and Elijah.  But he promised also
to build three tabernacles, one apart for Jesus, and one for Moses, and
one for Elijah, as if one tabernacle would not have sufficed for the
three, if it had been necessary for them to be in tabernacles and in the
high mountain.  And perhaps also in this he acted with evil intent, when
he incited him “who did not know what he said,” not desiring that Jesus
and Moses and Elijah should be together, but desiring to separate them
from one another, under pretext of the three tabernacles.”  And likewise
it was a lie, “It is good for us to be here;” <span
id="fr_5797"></span>[5798](#fn_5797) for if it had been a good thing
they would also have re<span id="page_472">p. 472</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.xl-Page_472"></span>mained there.  But if it were a lie,
you will seek to know who caused the lie to be spoken; and especially
since according to John, “When he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own;
for he is a liar and the father thereof;” <span
id="fr_5798"></span>[5799](#fn_5798) and as there is no truth apart from
the working of Him who says, “I am the Truth,” <span
id="fr_5799"></span>[5800](#fn_5799) so there is no lie apart from him
who is the enemy of truth.  These contrary qualities, accordingly, were
still in Peter truth and falsehood; and from truth he said, “Thou art
the Christ, the son of the living God,” <span
id="fr_5800"></span>[5801](#fn_5800) but from falsehood he said, “May
God be propitious to Thee, Lord, this shall not be unto Thee,” <span
id="fr_5801"></span>[5802](#fn_5801) and also, “It is good for us to be
here.” <span id="fr_5802"></span>[5803](#fn_5802)   But if any one will
not admit that Peter spoke these things from any evil inspiration, but
that his words were of his own mere choice, and it is demanded of him
how he will interpret, “not knowing what he said,” and, <span
id="fr_5803"></span>[5804](#fn_5803) “for he did not know what to
answer,” <span id="fr_5804"></span>[5805](#fn_5804) he will say, that in
the former case Peter held it to be a shameful thing and unworthy of
Jesus to admit that the Son of the living God, the Christ, whom already
the Father had revealed to him, should be killed; and in the present
case that, as having seen the two forms of Jesus and the one at the
transfiguration which was much more excellent, being well pleased with
that, he said that it was good to make their sojourning in that
mountain, in order that he himself and those with him might rejoice as
they beheld the transfiguration of Jesus and His face shining as the
sun, and His garments white as the light, and, in addition to these
things, might always behold in glory those whom they had once seen in
glory, Moses and Elijah; and that they might rejoice at the things which
they might hear, as they talked and held intercourse with each other,
Moses and Elijah with Jesus, and Jesus with them.
