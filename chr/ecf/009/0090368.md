<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>17.  The Brethren of Jesus.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xvii-p2"></span>And the saying, “*Whence hath this
man this wisdom,*” <span id="fr_5259"></span>[5260](#fn_5259) indicates
clearly that there was a great and surpassing wisdom in the words of
Jesus worthy of the saying, “lo, a greater than Solomon is here.” <span
id="fr_5260"></span>[5261](#fn_5260)   And He was wont to do greater
miracles than those wrought through Elijah and Elisha, and at a still
earlier date through Moses and Joshua the son of Nun.  And they spoke,
wondering, (not knowing that He was the son of a virgin, or not
believing it even if it was told to them, but supposing that He was the
son of Joseph the carpenter,) “is not this the carpenter’s son?” <span
id="fr_5261"></span>[5262](#fn_5261)   And depreciating the whole of
what appeared to be His nearest kindred, they said, “Is not His mother
called Mary?  And His brethren, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? 
And His sisters, are they not all with us?” <span
id="fr_5262"></span>[5263](#fn_5262)   They thought, then, that He was
the son of Joseph and Mary.  But some say, basing it on a tradition in
the Gospel according to Peter, <span
id="fr_5263"></span>[5264](#fn_5263) as it is entitled, or “The Book of
James,” <span id="fr_5264"></span>[5265](#fn_5264) that the brethren of
Jesus were sons of Joseph by a former wife, whom he married before
Mary.  Now those who say so wish to preserve the honour of Mary in
virginity to the end, so that that body of hers which was appointed to
minister to the Word which said, “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee,” <span
id="fr_5265"></span>[5266](#fn_5265) might not know intercourse with a
man after that the Holy Ghost came into her and the power from on high
overshadowed her.  And I think it in harmony with reason that Jesus was
the first-fruit among men of the purity which consists in chastity, and
Mary among women; for it were not pious to ascribe to any other than to
her the first-fruit of virginity.  And James is he whom Paul says in the
Epistle to the Galatians that he saw, “But other of the Apostles saw I
none, save James the Lord’s brother.” <span
id="fr_5266"></span>[5267](#fn_5266)   And to so great a reputation
among the people for righteousness did this James rise, that Flavius
Josephus, who wrote the “Antiquities of the Jews” in twenty books, when
wishing to exhibit the cause why the people suffered so great
misfortunes that even the temple was razed to the ground, said, that
these things happened to them in accordance with the wrath of God in
consequence of the things which they had dared to do against James the
brother of Jesus who is called Christ. <span
id="fr_5267"></span>[5268](#fn_5267)   And the wonderful thing is, that,
though he did not accept Jesus as Christ, he yet gave testimony that the
righteousness of James was so great; and he says that the people thought
that they had suffered these things because of James.  And Jude, who
wrote a letter of few lines, it is true, but filled with the healthful
words of heavenly grace, said in the preface, “Jude, the servant of
Jesus Christ and the brother of James.” <span
id="fr_5268"></span>[5269](#fn_5268)   With regard to Joseph and Simon
we have nothing to tell; but the saying, “And His sisters are they not
all with us,” <span id="fr_5269"></span>[5270](#fn_5269) seems to me to
signify something of this nature—they mind our things, not those of
Jesus, and have no unusual portion of surpassing wisdom as Jesus has. 
And perhaps by these things is indicated a new doubt concerning Him,
that Jesus was not a man but something diviner, inasmuch as <span
id="page_425">p. 425</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xvii-Page_425"></span>He was, as they supposed, the son
of Joseph and Mary, and the brother of four, and of the others—the
women—as well, and yet had nothing like to any one of His kindred, and
had not from education and teaching come to such a height of wisdom and
power.  For they also say elsewhere, “How knoweth this man letters
having never learned?” <span id="fr_5270"></span>[5271](#fn_5270) which
is similar to what is here said.  Only, though they say these things and
are so perplexed and astonished, they did not believe, but were offended
in Him; as if they had been mastered in the eyes of their mind by the
powers which, in the time of the passion, He was about to lead in
triumph on the cross.
