<span id="xv.iii.i.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxii-p1.1"></span>22.  The Word Was in the Beginning, I.e.,
in Wisdom, Which Contained All Things in Idea, Before They Existed. 
Christ’s Character as Wisdom is Prior to His Other Characters.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxii-p2"></span>So many meanings occur to us at once
of the word arche.  We have now to ask which of them we should adopt for
our text, “In the beginning was the Word.”  It is plain that we may at
once dismiss the meaning which connects it with transition or with a
road and its length.  Nor, it is pretty plain, will the meaning
connected with an origin serve our purpose.  One might, however, think
of the sense in which it points to the author, to that which brings
about the effect, if, as we read, <span
id="fr_4543"></span>[4544](#fn_4543.md) “God commanded and they were
created.”  For Christ is, in a manner, the demiurge, to whom the Father
says, “Let there be light,” and “Let there be a firmament.”  But Christ
is demiurge as a beginning (arche), inasmuch as He is wisdom.  It is in
virtue of His being wisdom that He is called arche.  For Wisdom says in
Solomon: <span id="fr_4544"></span>[4545](#fn_4544.md)   “God created me
the beginning of His ways, for His works,” so that the Word might be in
an arche, namely, in wisdom.  Considered in relation to the structure of
contemplation and thoughts about the whole of things, it is regarded as
wisdom; but in relation to that side of the objects of thought, in which
reasonable beings apprehend them, it is considered as the Word.  And
there is no wonder, since, as we have said before, the Saviour is many
good things, if He comprises in Himself thoughts of the first order, and
of the second, and of the third.  This is what John suggested when he
said about the Word: <span id="fr_4545"></span>[4546](#fn_4545.md)   “That
which was made was life in Him.”  Life then came in the Word.  And on
the one side the Word is no other than the Christ, the Word, He who was
with the Father, by whom all things were made; while, on the other side,
the Life is no other than the Son of God, who says: <span
id="fr_4546"></span>[4547](#fn_4546.md)   “I am the way and the truth and
the life.”  As, then, life came into being in the Word, so the Word in
the arche.  Consider, however, if we are at liberty to take this meaning
of arche for our text:  “In the beginning was the Word,” so as to obtain
the meaning that all things came into being according to wisdom and
according to the models of the system which are present in his
thoughts.  For I consider that as a house or a ship is built and
fashioned in accordance with the sketches of the builder or designer,
<span id="page_308">p. 308</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.xxii-Page_308"></span>the house or the ship having their
beginning (arche) in the sketches and reckonings in his mind, so all
things came into being in accordance with the designs of what was to be,
clearly laid down by God in wisdom.  And we should add that having
created, so to speak, ensouled <span
id="fr_4547"></span>[4548](#fn_4547.md) wisdom, He left her to hand over,
from the types which were in her, to things existing and to matter, the
actual emergence of them, their moulding and their forms<span
class="sc"><span id="xv.iii.i.xxii-p7.1"></span>. <span
id="fr_4548"></span>[4549](#fn_4548.md)  </span> But I consider, if it be
permitted to say this, that the beginning (arche) of real existence was
the Son of God, saying: <span id="fr_4549"></span>[4550](#fn_4549.md)   “I
am the beginning and the end, the <span class="Greek"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxii-p9.2"></span>Α</span> and the <span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.iii.i.xxii-p9.3"></span>Ω</span>, the first
and the last.”  We must, however, remember that He is not the arche in
respect of every name which is applied to Him.  For how can He be the
beginning in respect of His being life, when life came in the Word, and
the Word is manifestly the arche of life?  It is also tolerably evident
that He cannot be the arche in respect of His being the first-born from
the dead.  And if we go through all His titles carefully we find that He
is the arche only in respect of His being wisdom.  Not even as the Word
is He the arche, for the Word was in the arche.  And so one might
venture to say that wisdom is anterior to all the thoughts that are
expressed in the titles of the first-born of every creature.  Now God is
altogether one and simple; but our Saviour, for many reasons, since
God <span id="fr_4550"></span>[4551](#fn_4550.md) set Him forth a
propitiation and a first fruits of the whole creation, is made many
things, or perhaps all these things; the whole creation, so far as
capable of redemption, stands in need of Him. <span
id="fr_4551"></span>[4552](#fn_4551.md)   And, hence, He is made the light
of men, because men, being darkened by wickedness, need the light that
shines in darkness, and is not overtaken by the darkness; had not men
been in darkness, He would not have become the light of men.  The same
thing may be observed in respect of His being the first-born of the
dead.  For supposing the woman had not been deceived, and Adam had not
fallen, and man created for incorruption had obtained it, then He would
not have descended into the grave, nor would He have died, there being
no sin, nor would His love of men have required that He should die, and
if He had not died, He could not have been the first-born of the dead. 
We may also ask whether He would ever have become a shepherd, had man
not been thrown together with the beasts which are devoid of reason, and
made like to them.  For if God saves man and beasts, He saves those
beasts which He does save, by giving them a shepherd, since they cannot
have a king.  Thus if we collect the titles of Jesus, the question
arises which of them were conferred on Him later, and would never have
assumed such importance if the saints had begun and had also persevered
in blessedness.  Perhaps Wisdom would be the only remaining one, or
perhaps the Word would remain too, or perhaps the Life, or perhaps the
Truth, not the others, which He took for our sake.  And happy indeed are
those who in their need for the Son of God have yet become such persons
as not to need Him in His character as a physician healing the sick, nor
in that of a shepherd, nor in that of redemption, but only in His
characters as wisdom, as the word and righteousness, or if there be any
other title suitable for those who are so perfect as to receive Him in
His fairest characters.  So much for the phrase “In the beginning.”
