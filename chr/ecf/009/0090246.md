<span id="xv.iii.ii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>7.  Of Things Not Made Through the
Logos.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.vii-p2"></span>Let us see, however, why the words
are added, “And without Him was not anything (Gr. even one thing)
made.”  Some might think it superfluous to add to the words “All things
were made through Him,” the phrase “Without Him was not anything made.” 
For if everything whatsoever was made through the Logos, then nothing
was made without Him.  Yet it does not follow from the proposition that
without the Logos nothing was made, that all things were made through
the Logos.  It is possible that though nothing was made without the
Logos, all things were made, not through the Logos only, but some things
by Him.  We must, therefore, make ourselves sure in what sense the “all
things” is to be understood, and in what sense the “nothing.”  For,
without a clear preliminary definition of these terms, it might be
maintained that, if all things were made through the Logos, and evil is
a part of all things, then the whole matter of sin, and everything that
is wicked, that these also were made through the Logos.  But this we
must regard as false.  There is nothing absurd in thinking that
creatures were made through the Logos, and also that men’s brave deeds
have been done through Him, and all the useful acts of those who are now
in bliss; but with the sins and misfortunes of men it is otherwise.  Now
some have held that since evil is not based in the constitution of
things—for it did not exist at the beginning and at the end it will have
ceased—that, therefore, the evils of which we spoke are the Nothing; and
as some of the Greeks say that genera and forms, such as the (general)
animal and the man, belong to the category of Nothings, so it has been
supposed that all that is not of God is Nothing, and has not even
obtained through the Word the subsistence it appears to have.  We ask
whether it is possible to show from Scripture in any convincing way that
this is so.  As for the meanings of the word “Nothing” and “Not-being,”
they would appear to be synonymous, for Nothing can be spoken of as
Not-being, and the Not-being can be described as Nothing.  The Apostle,
however, appears to count the things which are not, not among those
which have no existence whatever, but rather among things which are
evil.  To him the Not-being is evil; “God,” he says, <span
id="fr_4688"></span>[4689](#fn_4688.md) “called the things that are not as
things that are.”  And Mardochæus, too, in the Esther of the Septuagint,
calls the enemies of Israel “those that are not,” saying, <span
id="fr_4689"></span>[4690](#fn_4689.md) “Deliver not Thy sceptre, O Lord,
to those that are not.”  We may also notice how evil men, on account of
their wickedness, are said not to be, from the name ascribed to God in
Exodus: <span id="fr_4690"></span>[4691](#fn_4690.md)   “For the Lord said
to Moses, I am, that is My name.”  The good God says this with respect
of us also who pray that we may be part of His congregation.  The
Saviour praises him, saying, <span id="fr_4691"></span>[4692](#fn_4691.md)
“None is good but one, God the Father.”  The good, then, is the same as
He who is.  Over against good is evil or wickedness, and over against
Him who is that which is not, whence it follows that evil and wickedness
are that which is not.  This, perhaps, is what has led some to affirm
that the devil is not created by God.  In respect that he is the devil
he is not the work of God, but he who is the devil is a created being,
and as there is no other creator but our God, he is a work of God.  It
is as if we should say that a murderer is not a work of God, while we
may say that in respect he is a man, God made him.  His being as a man
he received from God; <span id="page_331">p. 331</span> <span
id="xv.iii.ii.vii-Page_331"></span>we do not assert that he received
from God his being as a murderer.  All, then, who have part in Him who
is, and the saints have part in Him, may properly be called Beings; but
those who have given up their part in the Being, by depriving themselves
of Being, have become Not-beings.  But we said when entering on this
discussion, that Not-being and Nothing are synonymous, and hence those
who are not beings are Nothing, and all evil is nothing, since it is
Not-being, and thus since they are called Not-being came into existence
without the Logos, not being numbered among the all things which were
made through Him.  Thus we have shown, so far as our powers admit, what
are the “all things” which were made through the Logos, and what came
into existence without Him, since at no time is it Being, and it is,
therefore, called “Nothing.”
