<span id="xv.iii.vi.i-p2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.i-p2.1"></span>1.  Jesus Comes to Capernaum.  Statements
of the Four Evangelists Regarding This.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.i-p3"></span>“After this <span
id="fr_4987"></span>[4988](#fn_4987) He went down to Capernaum, He and
His mother and His brothers and His disciples; and there they abode not
many days.  And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up
to Jerusalem, and He found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep
and doves, and the changers of money sitting, and He made a sort of
scourge of cords, and cast them all out of the temple, and the sheep and
the oxen, and He poured out the small money of the changers and
overthrew their tables, and to those that sold the doves He said, Take
these things hence; make not My Father’s house a house of merchandize. 
Then His disciples remembered that it was written, that the zeal of thy
house shall eat me up.  The Jews therefore answered and said unto Him,
What sign showest Thou unto us, that Thou doest such things?  Jesus
answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I
will raise it up.  The Jews therefore answered, Forty-six years was this
temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?  But He
spoke of the temple of His body.  When therefore He rose from the dead,
His disciples remembered that He said this, and they believed the
Scripture and the word which Jesus said.  Now when He was at Jerusalem
at the passover at the feast, many believed in His name, beholding His
signs which He did.  But Jesus Himself did not trust Himself to them,
for that He knew all men, and because He had no need that any should
bear witness concerning man.  For He Himself knew what was in man.”

<span id="xv.iii.vi.i-p5"></span>The numbers which are recorded in the
book of that name <span id="fr_4988"></span>[4989](#fn_4988) obtained a
place in Scripture in accordance with some principle which determines
their proportion to each thing.  We ought therefore to enquire whether
the book of Moses which is called Numbers teaches us, should we be able
to trace it out, in some special way, the principle with regard to this
matter.  This remark I make to you at the outset of my tenth book, for
in many passages of Scripture I have observed the number ten to have a
peculiar privilege, and you may consider carefully whether the hope is
justified that this volume will bring you from God some special
benefit.  That this may prove to be the case, we will seek to yield
ourselves as fully as we can to God, who loves to bestow His choicest
gifts.  The book begins at the words:  “After this He went down to
Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples, and
there they abode not many days.”  The other three Evangelists say that
the Lord, after His conflict with the devil, departed into Galilee. 
Matthew and Luke represent that he was first at Nazara, <span
id="fr_4989"></span>[4990](#fn_4989) and then left them and came and
dwelt in Capernaum.  Matthew and Mark also state a certain reason why He
departed thither, namely, that He had heard that John was cast into
prison.  The words are as follows:  Matthew says, <span
id="fr_4990"></span>[4991](#fn_4990) “Then the devil leaveth Him, and
behold, angels came and ministered unto Him.  But when He heard that
John was delivered up, He departed into Galilee, and leaving Nazareth He
came and dwelt at Capernaum on the seashore in the borders of Zebulun
and Naphtali, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the
prophet, saying, The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali;” and
after the quotation from Isaiah:  “From that time Jesus began to preach
and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”  Mark has
the following: <span id="fr_4991"></span>[4992](#fn_4991)   “And He was
in the desert forty days and forty nights tempted by Satan, and He was
with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto Him.  But after
John was delivered up Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of
God, that the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand;
repent ye, and believe in the Gospel.”  Then after the narrative about
Andrew and Peter and James and John, Mark writes:  “And He entered into
Capernaum, and straightway on the Sabbath He was teaching in the
synagogue.”  Luke has, <span id="fr_4992"></span>[4993](#fn_4992) “And
having finished the temptation the devil departed from Him for a
season.  And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and
a fame went out <span id="page_382">p. 382</span> <span
id="xv.iii.vi.i-Page_382"></span>concerning Him into all the region
round about, and He taught in their synagogues being glorified of all. 
And He came to Nazara, where He had been brought up, and He entered as
His custom was into the synagogue on the Sabbath day.”  Then Luke <span
id="fr_4993"></span>[4994](#fn_4993) gives what He said at Nazara, and
how those in the synagogue were enraged at Him and cast Him out of the
city and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their cities were
built, to cast Him down headlong, and how going through the midst of
them the Lord went His way; and with this he connects the statement,
“And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching
them on the Sabbath day.”
