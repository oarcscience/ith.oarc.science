<span id="xvi.ii.v.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.ix-p1.1"></span>9.  Concerning the Question of Jesus in
Cæsarea, Who Do Men Say that I Am?  Different Conceptions of
Jesus.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.ix-p2"></span>“*Now when Jesus came into the parts of
Cæsarea Philippi, He asked His disciples.*” <span
id="fr_5604"></span>[5605](#fn_5604.md)   Jesus inquires of the disciples,
“Who do men say that I am,” that we may learn from the answer of the
Apostles the different conceptions then held among the Jews in regard to
our Saviour; and perhaps also that the disciples of Jesus might learn to
be interested in knowing what is said by men about them; <span
id="fr_5605"></span>[5606](#fn_5605.md) because that will be an advantage
to them who do it, by cutting off in every way occasions of evil if
anything evil is spoken of, and by increasing the incitements to good,
if anything good is spoken of.  Only, observe how, on account of the
different movements of opinion among the Jews about Jesus, some, under
the influence of unsound theories, said that He was John the Baptist,
like Herod the tetrarch who said to his servants, “This is John the
Baptist, he is risen from the dead, and therefore do the powers work in
him;” <span id="fr_5606"></span>[5607](#fn_5606.md) but others that He who
was now called Jesus was Elijah, either having been born a second time,
or living from that time in the flesh, and appearing at the present
time.  But those who said that Jesus was Jeremiah, and not that Jeremiah
was a type of the Christ, were perhaps influenced by what is said in the
beginning of Jeremiah about Christ, which was not fulfilled in the
prophet at that time, but was beginning to be fulfilled in Jesus, whom
“God set up over nations and kingdoms to root up, and to break down, and
to destroy, and to build up, and to transplant,” <span
id="fr_5607"></span>[5608](#fn_5607.md) having made Him to be a prophet to
the Gentiles to whom He proclaimed the word.  Moreover also those who
said, “that he was a certain one of the prophets,” <span
id="fr_5608"></span>[5609](#fn_5608.md) conceived this opinion concerning
Him because of those things which had been said in the prophets as unto
them, but which had not been fulfilled in their case.  But also the
Jews, as worthy of the veil which was upon their heart, held false
opinions concerning Jesus; while Peter as not a disciple “of flesh and
blood,” <span id="fr_5609"></span>[5610](#fn_5609.md) but as one fit to
receive the revelation of the Father in heaven, confessed that He was
the Christ.  The saying of Peter to the Saviour, “Thou art the Christ,”
when the Jews did not know that He was Christ, was indeed a great thing,
but greater that he knew Him not only to be Christ, but also “the Son of
the living God,” <span id="fr_5610"></span>[5611](#fn_5610.md) who had also
said through the prophets, “I live,” <span
id="fr_5611"></span>[5612](#fn_5611.md) and “They have forsaken Me the
spring of living water;” <span id="fr_5612"></span>[5613](#fn_5612.md) —and
He is life also, as from the Father the spring of life, who said, “I am
the Life;” <span id="fr_5613"></span>[5614](#fn_5613.md) and consider
carefully, whether, as the spring of the river is not the same thing as
the river, the spring of life is not the same as life.  And these things
we have added because to the saying, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of
God,” was subjoined the word “living;” <span
id="fr_5614"></span>[5615](#fn_5614.md) for it was necessary to set forth
something noteworthy in regard to that which is said about God and the
Father of all things as living, both in relation to His absolute life,
and in relation to those things which participate in it.  But since we
said that they were under the influence of unsound opinions who declared
that Jesus was John the Baptist, or any one of those named, in saying
this let us prove that if they had fallen in with Jesus as He was going
away to John for baptism, or with John when he was baptizing Jesus, or
if they had heard it from any one, they would not have said that Jesus
was John.  But also if they had understood the opinions under the
influence of which Jesus said, “If ye are willing to receive it, this is
Elijah which is to come,” <span id="fr_5615"></span>[5616](#fn_5615.md) and
had heard what was said, as men having ears, some would not have said
that He was Elijah.  And if those who said that He was Jeremiah had
perceived that the most of the prophets took upon themselves certain
features that were symbolical of Him, they would not have said that He
was Jeremiah; and in like manner the others would not have said that He
was one of the prophets.
