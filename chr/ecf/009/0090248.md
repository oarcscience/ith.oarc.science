<span id="xv.iii.ii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>9.  That the Logos Present in Us is Not
Responsible for Our Sins.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.ix-p2"></span>One point more on the words:  “Without
Him was not anything made.”  The question about evil must receive
adequate discussion; what was said of it has not, it is true, a very
likely appearance, and yet it appears to me that it ought not to be
simply overlooked.  The question is whether evil, also, was made through
the Logos, taking the Logos, now be it well noted, in the sense of that
reason which is in every one, as thus brought into being by the reason
<span id="page_332">p. 332</span> <span
id="xv.iii.ii.ix-Page_332"></span>which was from the beginning.  The
Apostle says: <span id="fr_4697"></span>[4698](#fn_4697)   “Without the
law sin was dead,” and adds, “But when the commandment came sin
revived,” and so teaches generally about sin that it has no power before
the law and the commandment (but the Logos is, in a sense, law and
commandment), and there would be no sin were there no law, for, <span
id="fr_4698"></span>[4699](#fn_4698) “sin is not imputed where there is
no law.”  And, again, there would be no sin but for the Logos, for “if I
had not come and spoken unto them,” Christ says, <span
id="fr_4699"></span>[4700](#fn_4699) “they had not had sin.”  For every
excuse is taken away from one who wants to make excuse for his sin, if,
though the Word is in him and shows him what he ought to do, he does not
obey it.  It seems, then, that all things, the worse things not
excepted, were made by the Logos, and without Him, taking the nothing
here in its simpler sense, was nothing made.  Nor must we blame the
Logos if all things were made by Him, and without Him nothing was made,
any more than we blame the master who has showed the pupil his duty,
when the instruction has been such as to leave the pupil, should he sin,
no excuse or room to say that he erred through ignorance.  This appears
the more plainly when we consider that master and pupil are
inseparable.  For as master and pupil are correlatives, and belong
together, so the Logos is present in the nature of reasonable beings as
such, always suggesting what they ought to do, even should we pay no
heed to his commands, but devote ourselves to pleasure and allow his
best counsels to pass by us unregarded.  As the eye is a servant given
us for the best purposes, and yet we use it to see things on which it is
wrong for us to look, and as we make a wrong use of our hearing when we
spend our time in listening to singing competitions and to other
forbidden sounds, so we outrage the Logos who is in us, and use Him
otherwise than as we ought, when we make Him assist in our
transgressions.  For He is present with those who sin, for their
condemnation, and He condemns the man who does not prefer Him to
everything else.  Hence we find it written: <span
id="fr_4700"></span>[4701](#fn_4700)   “The word which I have spoken
unto you, the same shall judge you.”  That is as if He should say:  “I,
the Word, who am always lifting up my voice in you, I, myself, will
judge you, and no refuge or excuse will then be left you.”  This
interpretation, however, may appear somewhat strained, as we have taken
the Word in one sense to be the Word in the beginning, who was with God,
God the <span id="page_333">p. 333</span> <span
id="xv.iii.ii.ix-Page_333"></span>Word, and have now taken it in another
sense, speaking of it, not only in reference to the principal works of
creation, as in the words, “All things were made through Him,” but as
related to all the acts of reasonable beings, this last being the Logos
(reason), without whose presence none of our sins are committed.  The
question arises whether the Logos in us is to be pronounced the same
being as that which was in the beginning and was with God, God the
Word.  The Apostle, certainly, does not appear to make the Logos in us a
different being from the Logos who was in the beginning with God.  “Say
not in thine heart,” he says, <span id="fr_4701"></span>[4702](#fn_4701)
“who shall go up into heaven; that is to bring Christ down, or who shall
go down into the abyss; that is to bring Christ up from the dead.  But
what saith the Scripture?  The Logos is very nigh thee, in thy mouth and
in thy heart.”
