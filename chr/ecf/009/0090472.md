<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxxi-p1.1"></span>31.  The Power to Bind on Earth and in
Heaven.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxxi-p2"></span>But to me it seems that, to the case
of him who after being thrice admonished was adjudged to be as the
Gentile and the publican, it is fitly subjoined, “*Verily, I say unto
you,*”—namely, to those who have judged any one to be as the Gentile and
the publican,—“*and what things soever ye shall bind on the
earth,*” <span id="fr_6032"></span>[6033](#fn_6032.md) etc.; for with
justice has he, who has thrice admonished and not been heard, bound him
who is judged to be as a Gentile and a publican; wherefore, when such an
one is bound and condemned by one of this character, he remains bound,
as no one of those in heaven overturns the judgment of the man who bound
him.  And, in like manner, he who was admonished once for all, and did
things worthy of being gained, having been set free by the admonition of
the man who gained him, and no longer bound by the cords of his own
sins, <span id="fr_6033"></span>[6034](#fn_6033.md) for which he was
admonished, shall be adjudged to have been set free by those in heaven. 
Only, it seems to be indicated that the things, which above <span
id="page_494">p. 494</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxxi-Page_494"></span>were granted to Peter alone, are
here given to all who give the three admonitions to all that have
sinned; so that, if they be not heard, they will bind on earth him who
is judged to be as a Gentile and a publican, as such an one has been
bound in heaven.  But since it was necessary, even if something in
common had been said in the case of Peter and those who had thrice
admonished the brethren, that Peter should have some element superior to
those who thrice admonished, in the case of Peter, this saying “I will
give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens,” <span
id="fr_6034"></span>[6035](#fn_6034.md) has been specially set before the
words, “And what things soever ye shall bind on earth,” etc.  And,
indeed, if we were to attend carefully to the evangelical writings, we
would also find here, and in relation to those things which seem to be
common to Peter and those who have thrice admonished the brethren, a
great difference and a pre-eminence in the things said to Peter,
compared with the second class.  For it is no small difference that
Peter received the keys not of one heaven but of more, and in order that
whatsoever things he binds on the earth may be bound not in one heaven
but in them all, as compared with the many who bind on earth and loose
on earth, so that these things are bound and loosed not in the heavens,
as in the case of Peter, but in one only; for they do not reach so high
a stage, with power as Peter to bind and loose in all the heavens. <span
id="fr_6035"></span>[6036](#fn_6035.md)   The better, therefore, is the
binder, so much more blessed is he who has been loosed, so that in every
part of the heavens his loosing has been accomplished.
