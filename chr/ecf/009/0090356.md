id="xvi.ii.iii.v-p1.1"></span>5.  The Field and the Treasure
Interpreted.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.v-p2"></span>And here we must inquire separately as
to the field, and separately as to the treasure hidden in it, and in
what way the man who has found this hidden treasure goes away with joy
and sells all that he has in order to buy that field; and we must also
inquire—what are the things which he sells.  The field, indeed, seems to
me according to these things to be the Scripture, which was planted with
what is manifest in the words of the history, and the law, and the
prophets, and the rest of the thoughts; for great and varied is the
planting of the words in the whole Scripture; but the treasure hidden in
the field is the thoughts concealed and lying under that which is
manifest, “of wisdom hidden in a mystery,” “even Christ, in whom are all
the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.” <span
id="fr_5184"></span>[5185](#fn_5184)   But another might say that the
field is that which is verily full, which the Lord blessed, the Christ
of God; but the treasure hidden in it is the things said to have been
“hidden in Christ” by Paul, who says about Christ, “in whom are the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.”  The heavenly things,
therefore, even the kingdom of heaven, as in a figure it is written in
the Scriptures—which are the kingdom of heaven, or Christ—Himself the
king of the ages, are the kingdom of heaven which is likened to a
treasure hidden in the field.
