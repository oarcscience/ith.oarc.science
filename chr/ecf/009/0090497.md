<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>24.  Jewish Criticism of the Law of
Christ.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xxiv-p2"></span>But perhaps some Jewish man of
those who dare to oppose the teaching of our Saviour will say, that when
Jesus said, <span id="page_511">p. 511</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xxiv-Page_511"></span>“Whosoever shall put away his own
wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an
adulteress,” <span id="fr_6227"></span>[6228](#fn_6227) He also gave
permission to put away a wife like as well as Moses did, who was said by
Him to have given laws for the hardness of heart of the people, and will
hold that the saying, “Because he found in her an unseemly thing,” <span
id="fr_6228"></span>[6229](#fn_6228) is to be reckoned as the same as
fornication on account of which with good cause a wife could be cast
away from her husband.  But to him it must be said that, if she who
committed adultery was according to the law to be stoned, clearly it is
not in this sense that the unseemly thing is to be understood.  For it
is not necessary for adultery or any such great indecency to write a
bill of divorcement and give it into the hands of the wife; but indeed
perhaps Moses called every sin an unseemly thing, on the discovery of
which by the husband in the wife, as not finding favour in the eyes of
her husband, the bill of divorcement is written, and the wife is sent
away from the house of her husband; “but from the beginning it hath not
been so.” <span id="fr_6229"></span>[6230](#fn_6229)   After this our
Saviour says, not at all permitting the dissolution of marriages for any
other sin than fornication alone, when detected in the wife, “Whosoever
shall put away his own wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh
her an adulteress.” <span id="fr_6230"></span>[6231](#fn_6230)   But it
might be a subject for inquiry if on this account He hinders any one
putting away a wife, unless she be caught in fornication, for any other
reason, as for example for poisoning, or for the destruction during the
absence of her husband from home of an infant born to them, or for any
form of murder whatsoever.  And further, if she were found despoiling
and pillaging the house of her husband, though she was not guilty of
fornication, one might ask if he would with reason cast away such an
one, seeing that the Saviour forbids any one to put away his own wife
saving for the cause of fornication.  In either case there appears to be
something monstrous, whether it be really monstrous, I do not know; for
to endure sins of such heinousness which seem to be worse than adultery
or fornication, will appear to be irrational; but again on the other
hand to act contrary to the design of the teaching of the Saviour, every
one would acknowledge to be impious.  I wonder therefore why He did not
say, Let no one put away his own wife saving for the cause of
fornication, but says, “Whosoever shall put away his own wife, saving
for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress.” <span
id="fr_6231"></span>[6232](#fn_6231)   For confessedly he who puts away
his wife when she is not a fornicator, makes her an adulteress, so far
as it lies with him, for if, “when the husband is living she shall be
called an adulteress if she be joined to another man;” <span
id="fr_6232"></span>[6233](#fn_6232) and when by putting her away, he
gives to her the excuse of a second marriage, very plainly in this way
he makes her an adulteress.  But as to whether her being caught in the
act of poisoning or committing murder, furnishes any defence of his
dismissal of her, you can inquire yourselves; for the husband can also
in other ways than by putting her away cause his own wife to commit
adultery; as, for example, allowing her to do what she wishes beyond
what is fitting, and stooping to friendship with what men she wishes,
for often from the simplicity of husbands such false steps happen to
wives; but whether there is a ground of defence or not for such husbands
in the case of such false steps, you will inquire carefully, and deliver
your opinion also in regard to the difficult questions raised by us on
the passage.  And even he who withholds himself from his wife makes her
oftentimes to be an adulteress when he does not satisfy her desires,
even though he does so under the appearance of greater gravity and
self-control.  And perhaps this man is more culpable who, so far as it
rests with him, makes her an adulteress when he does not satisfy her
desires than he who, for other reason than fornication, has sent her
away,—for poisoning or murder or any of the most grievous sins.  But as
a woman is an adulteress, even though she seem to be married to a man,
while the former husband is still living, so also the man who seems to
marry her who has been put away, does not so much marry her as commit
adultery with her according to the declaration of our Saviour.
