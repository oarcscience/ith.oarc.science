<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxxv-p1.1"></span>35.  Scriptural References to
Death.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxv-p2"></span>But since here it is written in the
three Evangelists, “They shall not taste of death,” <span
id="fr_5771"></span>[5772](#fn_5771.md) but in other writers different
things are written concerning death, it may not be out of place to bring
forward and examine these passages along with the “taste.”  In the
Psalms, then, it is said, “What man is <span id="page_469">p. 469</span>
<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxv-Page_469"></span>he that shall live and not see
death?” <span id="fr_5772"></span>[5773](#fn_5772.md)   And again, in
another place, “Let death come upon them and let them go down into Hades
alive;” <span id="fr_5773"></span>[5774](#fn_5773.md) but in one of the
prophets, “Death becoming mighty has swallowed them up;” <span
id="fr_5774"></span>[5775](#fn_5774.md) and in the Apocalypse, “Death and
Hades follow some.” <span id="fr_5775"></span>[5776](#fn_5775.md)   Now in
these passages it appears to me that it is one thing to taste of death,
but another thing to see death, and another thing for it to come upon
some, and that a fourth thing, different from the aforesaid, is
signified by the words, “Death becoming mighty has swallowed them up,”
and a fifth thing, different from these, by the words, Death and Hades
follow them.”  And if you were to collect them, you would perhaps find
also other differences than those which we have mentioned, by a
comparison of which with one another and right investigation, you would
find the things signified in each place.  But here I inquire whether it
is a less evil to see death, but a greater evil than seeing to taste of
it, but still worse than this that death should follow any one, and not
only follow him, but also now come upon him and seize him whom it
formerly followed; but to be swallowed up seems to be more grievous than
all the things spoken of.  But giving heed to what is said, and to the
differences of sins committed, you will not I think, be slow to admit
that things of this kind were intended by the Spirit who caused these
things to be written in the oracles of God.  But, if it be necessary to
give an exposition clearer than what has been said of what is signified
by seeing the Son of man coming in His own kingdom, or in His own glory,
and what is signified by seeing the kingdom of God come with power,
these things—whether those that are made to shine in our hearts, or that
are found by those who seek, or that enter gradually into our
thoughts,—let each one judge as he wills—we will set forth.  He who
beholds and apprehends the excellency of the Word, as he breaks down and
refutes all the plausible forms of things which are truly lies but
profess to be truths, sees the Son of man, (according to the word of
John, “the Word of God,”) coming in His own kingdom; but if such an one
were to behold the Word, not only breaking down plausible oppositions,
but also representing His own truths with perfect clearness, he would
behold His glory in addition to His kingdom.  And such an one indeed
would see in Him the kingdom of God come with power; and he would see
this, as one who is no longer now under the reign of “sin which reigns
in the mortal body of those who sin,” <span
id="fr_5776"></span>[5777](#fn_5776.md) but is ever under the orders of the
king, who is God of all, whose kingdom is indeed potentially “within
us,” <span id="fr_5777"></span>[5778](#fn_5777.md) but actually, and, as
Mark has called it, “with power,” and not at all in weakness within the
perfect alone.  These things, then, Jesus promised to the disciples who
were standing, prophesying not about all of them, but about some.
