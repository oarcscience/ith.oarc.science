id="xvi.ii.vii.ii-p1.1"></span>2.  The Harmony of Husband and
Wife.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.ii-p2"></span>So much then for the more common
understanding of the two or three whom the Word exhorts to be in
agreement.  But now let us also touch upon another interpretation which
was uttered by some one of our predecessors, exhorting those who were
married to sanctity and purity; for by the two, he says, whom the Word
desires to agree on earth, we must understand the husband and wife, who
by agreement defraud each other of bodily intercourse that they may give
themselves unto prayer; <span id="fr_6062"></span>[6063](#fn_6062.md) when
if they pray for anything whatever <span id="page_496">p. 496</span>
<span id="xvi.ii.vii.ii-Page_496"></span>that they shall ask, they shall
receive it, the request being granted to them by the Father in heaven of
Jesus Christ on the ground of such agreement.  And this interpretation
does not appear to me to cause dissolution of marriage, but to be an
incitement to agreement, so that if the one wished to be pure, but the
other did not desire it, and on this account he who willed and was able
to fulfil the better part, condescended to the one who had not the power
or the will, they would not both have the accomplishment from the Father
in heaven of Jesus Christ, of anything whatever that they might ask.
