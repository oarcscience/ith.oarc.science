<span id="xii.iv.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVI.—Let Us Cleave to the
Righteous:  Your Strife is Pernicious.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xlvi-p2"></span>Such examples, therefore, brethren, it
is right that we should follow; <span
id="fr_4243"></span>[4244](#fn_4243.md) since it is written, “Cleave to the
holy, for those that cleave to them shall \[themselves\] be made
holy.” <span id="fr_4244"></span>[4245](#fn_4244.md)   And again, in
another place, \[the Scripture\] saith, “With a harmless man thou shalt
prove <span id="fr_4245"></span>[4246](#fn_4245.md) thyself harmless, and
with an elect man thou shalt be elect, and with a perverse man thou
shalt show <span id="fr_4246"></span>[4247](#fn_4246.md) thyself
perverse.” <span id="fr_4247"></span>[4248](#fn_4247.md)   Let us cleave,
therefore, to the innocent and righteous, since these are the elect of
God.  Why are there strifes, and tumults, and divisions, and schisms,
and wars <span id="fr_4248"></span>[4249](#fn_4248.md) among you?  Have we
not \[all\] one God and one Christ?  Is there not one Spirit of grace
poured out upon us?  And have we not one calling in Christ? <span
id="fr_4249"></span>[4250](#fn_4249.md)   Why do we divide and tear in
pieces the members of Christ, and raise up strife against our own body,
and have reached such a height of madness as to forget that “we are
members one of another?” <span id="fr_4250"></span>[4251](#fn_4250.md)  
Remember the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, how <span
id="fr_4251"></span>[4252](#fn_4251.md) He said, “Woe to that man \[by
whom <span id="fr_4252"></span>[4253](#fn_4252.md) offences come\]!  It
were better for him that he had never been born, than that he should
cast a stumbling-block before one of my elect.  Yea, it were better for
him that a millstone should be hung about \[his neck\], and he should be
sunk in the depths of the sea, than that he should cast a
stumbling-block before one of my little ones.” <span
id="fr_4253"></span>[4254](#fn_4253.md)   Your schism has subverted \[the
faith of\] many, has discouraged many, has given rise to doubt in many,
and has caused grief to us all.  And still your sedition continueth.
