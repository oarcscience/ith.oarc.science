<span id="xvi.ii.v.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>13.  The “Gates of Hades” And the “Gates
of Zion” Contrasted.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xiii-p2"></span>In this place, then, the gates of
Hades are spoken of; but in the Psalms the prophet gives thanks saying,
“He who lifteth me up from the gates of death that I may declare all thy
praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion.” <span
id="fr_5643"></span>[5644](#fn_5643.md)   And from this we learn that it is
never possible for any one to be fit to declare the praises of God,
unless he has been lifted up from the gates of death, and has come to
the gates of Zion.  Now the gates of Zion may be conceived as opposed to
the gates of death, so that there is one gate of death, dissoluteness,
but a gate of Zion, self-control; and so a gate of death,
unrighteousness, but a gate of Zion, righteousness, which the prophet
shows forth saying, “This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall
enter into it.” <span id="fr_5644"></span>[5645](#fn_5644.md)   And again
there is cowardice, a gate of death, but manly courage, a gate of Zion;
and want of prudence, a gate of death, but its opposite, prudence, a
gate of Zion.  But to all the gates of the “knowledge which is falsely
so called” <span id="fr_5645"></span>[5646](#fn_5645.md) one gate is
opposed, the gate of knowledge which is free from falsehood.  But
consider if, because of the say<span id="page_458">p. 458</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.xiii-Page_458"></span>ing , “our wrestling is not against
flesh and blood,” <span id="fr_5646"></span>[5647](#fn_5646.md) etc., you
can say that each power and world-ruler of this darkness, and each one
of the “spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places” <span
id="fr_5647"></span>[5648](#fn_5647.md) is a gate of Hades and a gate of
death.  Let, then, the principalities and powers with which our
wrestling is, be called gates of Hades, but the “ministering
spirits” <span id="fr_5648"></span>[5649](#fn_5648.md) gates of
righteousness.  But as in the case of the better things many gates are
first spoken of, and after the gates, one, in the passage, “Open to me
the gates of righteousness, I will enter into them, and will make full
confession to the Lord,” and “this is the gate of the Lord, by it the
righteous shall enter;” <span id="fr_5649"></span>[5650](#fn_5649.md) so
also in the case of those gates which are opposed, many are the gates of
Hades and death, each a power; but over all these the wicked one
himself.  And let us take heed in regard to each sin, as if we were
descending into some gate of death if we sin; but when we are lifted up
from the gates of death let us declare all the praises of the Lord in
the gates of the daughter of Zion; as, for example, in one gate of the
daughter of Zion—that which is called self-control—we will declare by
our self-control the praises of God; and in another which is called
righteousness, by righteousness we will declare the praises of God; and,
generally, in all things whatsoever of a praiseworthy character with
which we are occupied, in these we are at some gate of the daughter of
Zion, declaring at each gate some praise of God.  But we must make
inquiry whether in one of the Twelve <span
id="fr_5650"></span>[5651](#fn_5650.md) it is said, “They hated him that
reproveth in the gates, and they loathed the holy word.” <span
id="fr_5651"></span>[5652](#fn_5651.md)   Perhaps, then, he who reproves in
the gates is of the gates of the daughter of Zion, reproving those who
are in sins which are opposed to this gate, even of the gates of Hades
or death.  But if ye do not so understand the words, “They hated him
that reproveth in the gates,” either the expression “in the gates” will
be held to be superfluous, or investigate how that which is said can be
worthy of the prophetic spirit.
