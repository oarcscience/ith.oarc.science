<p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.vi.vii-p2"></A>But we must ask why His brothers are not called to the wedding:&#160; they were not there, for it is not said they were; but they go down to Capernaum with Him and His mother and His disciples.&#160; We must also examine why on this occasion they do not &#8220;<i>go in to</i>&#8221; Capernaum, nor &#8220;<i>go up to</i>,&#8221; but &#8220;go down to&#8221; it.&#160; Consider if we must not understand by His brothers here the powers which went down along with Him, not called to the wedding according to the explanations given above, since it is in lower and humbler places than those who are called disciples of Christ, and in another way, that these brothers receive assistance.&#160; For if His mother is called, then there are some bearing fruit, and even to these the Lord goes down with the servants and disciples of the Word, to help such persons, His mother also being with Him.&#160; Those indeed who are called Capernaum appear not to be able to allow Jesus and those who went down with Him to make a longer stay with them:&#160; hence they remain with them not many days.&#160; For the lower field of consolation does not admit the illumination of many doctrines, but is only capable of a few.&#160; To get a clear view of the difference between those who receive Jesus for longer and for shorter time, we may compare with this, &#8220;They abode there not many days,&#8221; the words recorded in Matthew as spoken by Christ when risen from the dead to His disciples who were being sent out to teach all nations,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5011"></A><A HREF="#fn_5011"><FONT SIZE="1">5012</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.&#8221;&#160; To those who are to know all that human nature can know while it still is here, is said with emphasis, &#8220;I am with you;&#8221; and as the rise of each new day upon the field of contemplation brings more days before the eyes of the blessed, therefore He says, &#8220;All the days till the end of the world.&#8221;&#160; As for those in Capernaum, on the contrary, to whom they go down as to the more needy, not only Jesus, but also His mother and His brothers and His disciples &#8220;abode there not many days.&#8221;</p>
