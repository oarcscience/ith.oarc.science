<span id="xv.iii.i.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxiv-p1.1"></span>24.  Christ as Light; How He, and How His
Disciples are the Light of the World.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxiv-p2"></span>He said, then, that He was the light
of the world; and we have to examine, along with this title, those which
are parallel to it; and, indeed, are thought by some to be not merely
parallel, but identical with <span id="page_311">p. 311</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.xxiv-Page_311"></span>it.  He is the true light, and the
light of the Gentiles.  In the opening of the Gospel now before us He is
the light of men:  “That which was made,” <span
id="fr_4580"></span>[4581](#fn_4580.md) it says, “was life in Him, and the
life was the light of men; and the light shines in darkness, and the
darkness did not overtake it.”  A little further on, in the same
passage, He is called the true light: <span
id="fr_4581"></span>[4582](#fn_4581.md)   “The true light, which lightens
every man, was coming into the world.”  In Isaiah, He is the light of
the Gentiles, as we said before.  “Behold, <span
id="fr_4582"></span>[4583](#fn_4582.md) I have set Thee for a light of the
Gentiles, that Thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the
earth.”  Now the sensible light of the world is the sun, and after it
comes very worthily the moon, and the same title may be applied to the
stars; but those lights of the world are said in Moses to have come into
existence on the fourth day, and as they shed light on the things on the
earth, they are not the true light.  But the Saviour shines on creatures
which have intellect and sovereign reason, that their minds may behold
their proper objects of vision, and so he is the light of the
intellectual world, that is to say, of the reasonable souls which are in
the sensible world, and if there be any beings beyond these in the world
from which He declares Himself to be our Saviour.  He is, indeed, the
most determining and distinguished part of that world, and, as we may
say, the sun who makes the great day of the Lord.  In view of this day
He says to those who partake of His light, “Work <span
id="fr_4583"></span>[4584](#fn_4583.md) while it is day; the night cometh
when no man can work.  As long as I am in the world, I am the light of
the world.”  Then He says to His disciples, <span
id="fr_4584"></span>[4585](#fn_4584.md) “Ye are the light of the world,”
and “Let your light shine before men.”  Thus we see the Church, the
bride, to present an analogy to the moon and stars, and the disciples
have a light, which is their own or borrowed from the true sun, so that
they are able to illuminate those who have no command of any spring of
light in themselves.  We may say that Paul and Peter are the light of
the world, and that those of their disciples who are enlightened
themselves, but are not able to enlighten others, are the world of which
the Apostles were the light.  But the Saviour, being the light of the
world, illuminates not bodies, but by His incorporeal power the
incorporeal intellect, to the end that each of us, enlightened as by the
sun, may be able to discern the rest of the things of the mind.  And as
when the sun is shining the moon and the stars lose their power of
giving light, so those who are irradiated by Christ and receive His
beams have no need of the ministering apostles and prophets—we must have
courage to declare this truth—nor of the angels; I will add that they
have no need even of the greater powers when they are disciples of that
first-born light.  To those who do not receive the solar beams of
Christ, the ministering saints do afford an illumination much less than
the former; this illumination is as much as those persons can receive,
and it completely fills them.  Christ, again, the light of the world, is
the true light as distinguished from the light of sense; nothing that is
sensible is true.  Yet though the sensible is other than the true, it
does not follow that the sensible is false, for the sensible may have an
analogy with the intellectual, and not everything that is not true can
correctly be called false.  Now I ask whether the light of the world is
the same thing with the light of men, and I conceive that a higher power
of light is intended by the former phrase than by the latter, for the
world in one sense is not only men.  Paul shows that the world is
something more than men when he writes to the Corinthians in his first
Epistle: <span id="fr_4585"></span>[4586](#fn_4585.md)   “We are made a
spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.”  In one sense,
too, it may be considered, <span id="fr_4586"></span>[4587](#fn_4586.md)
the world is the creation which is being delivered from the bondage of
corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God, whose
earnest expectation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of
God.  We also draw attention to the comparison which may be drawn
between the statement, “I am the light of the world,” and the words
addressed to the disciples, “Ye are the light of the world.”  Some
suppose that the genuine disciples of Jesus are greater than other
creatures, some seeking the reason of this in the natural growth of
these disciples, others inferring it from their harder struggle.  For
those beings which are in flesh and blood have greater labours and a
life more full of dangers than those which are in an ethereal body, and
the lights of heaven might not, if they had put on bodies of earth, have
accomplished this life of ours free from danger and from error.  Those
who incline to this argument may appeal to those texts of Scripture
which say the most exalted things about men, and to the fact that the
Gospel is addressed directly to men; not so much is said about the
creation, or, as we understand it, about the <span id="page_312">p.
312</span> <span id="xv.iii.i.xxiv-Page_312"></span>world.  We
read, <span id="fr_4587"></span>[4588](#fn_4587.md) “As I and Thou are one,
that they also may be one in Us,” and <span
id="fr_4588"></span>[4589](#fn_4588.md) “Where I am, there will also My
servant be.”  These sayings, plainly, are about men; while about the
creation it is said that it is delivered from the bondage of corruption
into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.  It might be added
that not even when it is delivered will it take part in the glory of the
sons of God.  Nor will those who hold this view forget that the
first-born of every creature, honouring man above all else, became man,
and that it was not any of the constellations existing in the sky, but
one of another order, appointed for this purpose and in the service of
the knowledge of Jesus, that was made to be the Star of the East,
whether it was like the other stars or perchance better than they, to be
the sign of Him who is the most excellent of all.  And if the boasting
of the saints is in their tribulations, since <span
id="fr_4589"></span>[4590](#fn_4589.md) “tribulation worketh patience, and
patience probation, and probation hope, and hope maketh not ashamed,”
then the afflicted creation cannot have the like patience with man, nor
the like probation, nor the like hope, but another degree of these,
since <span id="fr_4590"></span>[4591](#fn_4590.md) “the creation was made
subject to vanity, not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected
it, for hope.”  Now he who shrinks from conferring such great attributes
on man will turn to another direction and say that the creature being
subjected to vanity groans and suffers greater affliction than those who
groan in this tabernacle, for has she not suffered for the utmost extent
of time in her service of vanity—nay, many times as long as man?  For
why does she do this not willingly, but that it is against her nature to
be subject to vanity, and not to have the best arrangement of her life,
that which she shall receive when she is set free, when the world is
destroyed and released even from the vanity of bodies.  Here, however,
we may appear to be stretching too far, and aiming at more than the
question now before us requires.  We may return, therefore, to the point
from which we set out, and ask for what reason the Saviour is called the
light of the world, the true light, and the light of men.  Now we saw
that He is called the true light with reference to the sensible light of
the world, and that the light of the world is the same thing as the
light of men, or that we may at least enquire whether they are the
same.  This discussion is not superfluous.  Some students do not take
anything at all out of the statement that the Saviour is the Word; and
it is important for us to assure ourselves that we are not chargeable
with caprice in fixing our attention on that notion.  If it admits of
being taken in a metaphorical sense we ought not to take it
literally. <span id="fr_4591"></span>[4592](#fn_4591.md)   When we apply
the mystical and allegorical method to the expression “light of the
world” and the many analogous terms mentioned above, we should surely do
so with this expression also.
