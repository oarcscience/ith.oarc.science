<span id="xv.iii.v.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.xxix-p1.1"></span>29.  The River of Egypt and Its Dragon,
Contrasted with the Jordan.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxix-p2"></span>But that the Spirit in the inspired
Scriptures is not speaking mainly of rivers to be seen with the eyes,
may be gathered from Ezekiel’s prophecies against Pharaoh, king of
Egypt: <span id="fr_4946"></span>[4947](#fn_4946.md)   “Behold I am against
thee, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon, seated in the midst of
rivers, who sayest, Mine are the rivers, and I made them.  And I will
put traps in thy jaws, and I will make the fishes of the river to stick
to thy fins, and I will bring thee up from the midst of thy river, and
all the fish of the river, and I will cast thee down quickly and all the
fish of the river; thou shalt fall upon the face of thy land, and thou
shalt not be gathered together, and thou shalt not be adorned.”  For
what real bodily dragon has ever been reported as having been seen in
the material river of Egypt?  But consider if the river of Egypt be not
the dwelling of the dragon who is our enemy, who was not even able to
kill the child Moses.  But as the dragon is in the river of Egypt, so is
God in the river which makes glad the city of God; for the Father is in
the Son.  Hence those who come to wash themselves in Him put away the
reproach of Egypt, and become more fit to be restored.  They are
cleansed from that foulest leprosy, receive a double portion of
spiritual gifts, and are made ready to receive the Holy Spirit, since
the spiritual dove does not light on any other stream.  Thus we have
considered in a way more worthy of the sacred <span id="page_375">p.
375</span> <span id="xv.iii.v.xxix-Page_375"></span>subject the Jordan
and the purification that is in it, and Jesus being washed in it, and
the house of preparation.  Let us, then, draw from the river as much
help as we require.
