<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.xxvi-p1.1"></span>26.  The Promises Addressed to Jerusalem
in the Prophets Refer to the Church, and are Still to Be
Fulfilled.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxvi-p2"></span>After all this it is proper to ask
whether what is narrated as having taken place about the temple has ever
taken place or ever will take place about the spiritual house.  The
argument may seem to pinch in whichever way we take it.  If we say that
it is possible that something like what is told about the temple may
take place with regard to the spiritual house, or has already taken
place in it, then those who hear us will, with difficulty, be brought to
admit that a change can take place in such good things as these,
firstly, because they do not wish it, and secondly, because of the
incongruity of thinking that such things admit of change.  If, on the
other hand, We seek to maintain the unchangeableness of the good things
once <span id="page_406">p. 406</span> <span
id="xv.iii.vi.xxvi-Page_406"></span>given to the saints, then we cannot
apply to them what we find in the history, and we shall seem to be doing
what those of the heresies do, who fail to maintain the unity of the
narrative of Scripture from beginning to end.  If we are not to take the
view proper to old wives or Jews, of the promises recorded in the
prophets, and especially in Isaiah, if, that is to say, we are to look
for their fulfilment in connection with the Jerusalem on earth, then, as
certain remarkable things connected with the building of the temple and
the restoration of the people from the captivity are spoken of as
happening after the captivity and the destruction of the temple, we must
say that we are now the temple and the people which was carried captive,
but is to come up again to Judæa and Jerusalem, and to be built with the
precious stones of Jerusalem.  But I cannot tell if it be possible that,
at the revolution of long periods of time, things of the same nature
should take place again, but in a worse way.  The prophecies of Isaiah
which we mentioned are the following: <span
id="fr_5130"></span>[5131](#fn_5130.md)   “Behold I prepare for thy stone
carbuncle and for thy foundation sapphire; and I will make thy
battlements jasper, and thy gates stones of crystal, and thy outer wall
choice stones; and all thy sons shall be taught of the Lord, and in
great peace shall thy children be, and in righteousness shalt thou be
built.”  And a little further on, to the same Jerusalem: <span
id="fr_5131"></span>[5132](#fn_5131.md)   “And the glory of Lebanon shall
come to thee with cypress, and pine, and cedar, along with those who
will glorify My holy place.  And the sons of them that humbled thee and
insulted thee shall come to thee in fear; and thou shalt be called the
city of the Lord, Sion of holy Israel, because thou wert desolate and
hated, and there was none to help thee.  And I will make thee an eternal
delight, a joy of generations of generations.  And thou shalt suck the
milk of the Gentiles and shall eat the riches of kings, and thou shalt
know that I am the Lord that saveth thee and the God of Israel that
chooseth thee.  And instead of brass I will bring thee gold, and instead
of iron I will bring thee silver, and for wood I will bring thee brass,
and for stones iron.  And I will establish thy rulers in peace and thy
overseers in righteousness.  And wickedness shall no more be heard in
thy land, nor affliction and distress in thy borders, but thy walls
shall be called salvation and thy gates sculpture.  And the sun shall no
longer be to thee for light by day, nor shall the rising of the moon
give light to thee by night, but Christ shall be to thee an everlasting
light and thy God thy glory.  For thy sun shall no more go down, and thy
moon shall not fail, for thy Lord shall be to thee an everlasting light,
and the days of thy mourning shall be fulfilled.”  These prophecies
clearly refer to the age still to come, and they are addressed to the
children of Israel in their captivity, to whom He was sent and came, who
said, “I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel.” <span id="fr_5132"></span>[5133](#fn_5132.md)   Such things,
though they are captives, they are to receive in their own land; and
proselytes also are to come to them at that time through Christ, and are
to fly to them, according to the saying, <span
id="fr_5133"></span>[5134](#fn_5133.md) “Behold, proselytes shall come to
thee through Me, and shall flee to thee for refuge.”  And if all this is
to take place with the captives, then it is plain that they must be
about their temple, and that they must go up there again to be built up,
having become the most precious of stones.  For we find with John in his
Apocalyse, <span id="fr_5134"></span>[5135](#fn_5134.md) the promise made
to him that overcomes, that he will be a pillar in the temple of God,
and will go no more out.  All this I have said with a view to our
obtaining a cursory view at least of the matters pertaining to the
temple, and the house of God, and the Church and Jerusalem, which we
cannot now take up systematically.  Those, however, who, in their
reading of the prophets, do not shrink from the labour of seeking after
their spiritual meaning, must enquire into these matters with the
greatest particularity, and must take account of every possibility.  So
far of “the temple of His body.”
