<span id="xv.iii.ii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>14.  How the Natures of Men are Not So
Fixed from the First, But that They May Pass from Darkness to
Light.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xiv-p2"></span>We have been discussing certain
things which are opposite, and what has been said of them may serve to
suggest what <span id="page_335">p. 335</span> <span
id="xv.iii.ii.xiv-Page_335"></span>has been omitted.  We are speaking of
life and the light of men, and the opposite to life is death; the
opposite to the light of men, the darkness of men.  It is therefore
plain that he who is in the darkness of men is in death, and that he who
works the works of death is nowhere but in darkness.  But he who is
mindful of God, if we consider what it is to be mindful of Him, is not
in death, according to the saying, <span
id="fr_4710"></span>[4711](#fn_4710) “In death there is no one who
remembers Thee.”  Are the darkness of men, and death, such as they are
by nature?  On this point we have another passage, <span
id="fr_4711"></span>[4712](#fn_4711) “We were once darkness, but now
light in the Lord,” even if we be now in the fullest sense saints and
spiritual persons.  Thus he who was once darkness has become, like Paul,
capable of being light in the Lord.  Some consider that some natures are
spiritual from the first, such as those of Paul and the holy Apostles;
but I scarcely see how to reconcile with such a view, what the above
text tells us, that the spiritual person was once darkness and
afterwards became light.  For if the spiritual was once darkness what
can the earthy have been?  But if it is true that darkness became light,
as in the text, how is it unreasonable to suppose that all darkness is
capable of becoming light?  Had not Paul said, “We were once in
darkness, but now are we light in the Lord,” and thus implied of those
whom they consider to be naturally lost, that they were darkness, or are
darkness still, the hypothesis about the different natures might have
been admissible.  But Paul distinctly says that he had once been
darkness but was now light in the Lord, which implies the possibility
that darkness should turn into light.  But he who perceives the
possibility of a change on each side for the better or for the worse,
will not find it hard to gain an insight into every darkness of men, or
into that death which consists in the darkness of men.
