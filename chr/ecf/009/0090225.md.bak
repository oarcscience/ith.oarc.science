Shepherd.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxix-p2"></span>But as one cannot be in the Father or
with the Father except by ascending from below upwards and coming first
to the divinity of the Son, through which one may be led by the hand and
brought to the blessedness of the Father Himself, so the Saviour has the
inscription “The Door.”  And as He is a lover of men, and approves the
impulse of human souls to better things, even of those who do not hasten
to reason (the Logos), but like sheep have a weakness and gentleness
apart from all accuracy and reason, so He is the Shepherd.  For the Lord
saves men and beasts, <span id="fr_4596"></span>[4597](#fn_4596.md) and
Israel and Juda are sowed with the seed not of men only but also of
beasts. <span id="fr_4597"></span>[4598](#fn_4597.md)
