id="xv.iii.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>7.  Why His Brothers are Not Called to
the Wedding; And Why He Abides at Capernaum Not Many Days.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.vii-p2"></span>But we must ask why His brothers are
not called to the wedding:  they were not there, for it is not said they
were; but they go down to Capernaum with Him and His mother and His
disciples.  We must also examine why on this occasion they do not “*go
in to*” Capernaum, nor “*go up to*,” but “go down to” it.  Consider if
we must not understand by His brothers here the powers which went down
along with Him, not called to the wedding according to the explanations
given above, since it is in lower and humbler places than those who are
called disciples of Christ, and in another way, that these brothers
receive assistance.  For if His mother is called, then there are some
bearing fruit, and even to these the Lord goes down with the servants
and disciples of the Word, to help such persons, His mother also being
with Him.  Those indeed who are called Capernaum appear not to be able
to allow Jesus and those who went down with Him to make a longer stay
with them:  hence they remain with them not many days.  For the lower
field of consolation does not admit the illumination of many doctrines,
but is only capable of a few.  To get a clear view of the difference
between those who receive Jesus for longer and for shorter time, we may
compare with this, “They abode there not many days,” the words recorded
in Matthew as spoken by Christ when risen from the dead to His disciples
who were being sent out to teach all nations, <span
id="fr_5011"></span>[5012](#fn_5011.md) “Behold, I am with you always, even
to the end of the world.”  To those who are to know all that human
nature can know while it still is here, is said with emphasis, “I am
with you;” and as the rise of each new day upon the field of
contemplation brings more days before the eyes of the blessed, therefore
He says, “All the days till the end of the world.”  As for those in
Capernaum, on the contrary, to whom they go down as to the more needy,
not only Jesus, but also His mother and His brothers and His disciples
“abode there not many days.”
