<span id="v.ii-p1"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii-p1.1"></span>The Apocalypse of Peter.</span>

<span id="v.ii-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="v.ii-p3"></span>1.  …many of them will be false
prophets, <span id="fr_3876"></span>[3877](#fn_3876.md) and will teach
divers ways and doctrines of perdition:  but these will become sons of
perdition. <span id="fr_3877"></span>[3878](#fn_3877.md)   3.  And then God
will come unto my faithful ones who hunger and thirst and are afflicted
and purify their souls in this life; and he will judge the sons of
lawlessness. <span id="fr_3878"></span>[3879](#fn_3878.md)

<span id="v.ii-p7"></span>4.  And furthermore the Lord said:  Let us go
into the mountain: <span id="fr_3879"></span>[3880](#fn_3879.md)   Let us
pray.  5.  And going with him, we, the twelve disciples, begged that he
would show us one of our brethren, the righteous who are gone forth out
of the world, in order that we might see of what manner of form they
are, and having taken courage, might also encourage <span
id="fr_3880"></span>[3881](#fn_3880.md) the men who hear us.

<span id="v.ii-p10"></span>6.  And as we prayed, suddenly there appeared
two men standing before the Lord towards the East, on whom we were not
able to look; <span id="fr_3881"></span>[3882](#fn_3881.md) 7, for there
came forth from their countenance a ray as of the sun, and their raiment
was shining, such as eye of man <span
id="fr_3882"></span>[3883](#fn_3882.md) never saw; for no mouth is able to
express or heart to conceive the glory with which they were endued, and
the beauty of their appearance.  8.  And as we looked upon them, we were
astounded; for their bodies were whiter than any snow and ruddier than
any rose; <span id="fr_3883"></span>[3884](#fn_3883.md) 9, and the red
thereof was mingled with the white, and I am utterly unable to express
their beauty; 10, for their hair was curly and bright and seemly both on
their face and shoulders, as it were a wreath <span
id="fr_3884"></span>[3885](#fn_3884.md) woven of spikenard and
divers-coloured flowers, or like a rainbow in the sky, such was their
seemliness.

<span id="v.ii-p15"></span>11.  Seeing therefore their beauty we became
astounded at them, since they appeared suddenly.  12.  And I approached
the Lord and said:  Who are these?  13.  He saith to me:  These are your
brethren the righteous, whose forms ye desired to see.  14.  And I said
to him:  And where are all the righteous ones and what is the æon in
which they are and have this glory?

<span id="v.ii-p16"></span>15.  And the Lord showed me <span
id="fr_3885"></span>[3886](#fn_3885.md) a very great country outside of
this world, exceeding bright with light, and the air there lighted with
the rays of the sun, and the earth itself blooming with unfading flowers
and full of spices and plants, fair-flowering and incorruptible and
bearing blessed fruit.  16.  And so great was the perfume that it <span
id="fr_3886"></span>[3887](#fn_3886.md) was borne thence even unto us. 
17.  And the dwellers in that place were clad in the raiment of shining
angels and their raiment was like unto their country; and angels hovered
about them there.  18.  And the glory of the dwellers there was equal,
and with one voice they sang praises alternately to the Lord God,
rejoicing in that place.  19.  The Lord saith to us:  This is the place
of your high-priests, <span id="fr_3887"></span>[3888](#fn_3887.md) the
righteous men.

<span id="v.ii-p20"></span>20.  And over against that place I saw
another, squalid, and it was the place of punishment; and those who were
punished there and the punishing angels had their raiment dark <span
id="fr_3888"></span>[3889](#fn_3888.md) like the air of the place.

<span id="v.ii-p22"></span>21.  And there were certain there hanging by
the tongue:  and these were the blasphemers of the way of righteousness;
and under them lay fire, <span id="fr_3889"></span>[3890](#fn_3889.md)
burning and punishing them.

<span id="v.ii-p24"></span>22.  And there was a great lake, full of
<span id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span
id="v.ii-Page_146"></span>flaming mire, in which were certain men that
pervert righteousness, <span id="fr_3890"></span>[3891](#fn_3890.md) and
tormenting angels afflicted them.

<span id="v.ii-p26"></span>23.  And there were also others, women,
hanged by their hair over that mire that bubbled up:  and these were
they who adorned themselves for adultery; and the men who mingled with
them in the defilement <span id="fr_3891"></span>[3892](#fn_3891.md) of
adultery, were hanging by the feet and their heads in that mire.  *And*
I said:  I did not believe that I should come into this place.

<span id="v.ii-p28"></span>24.  And I saw the murderers and those who
conspired with them, cast into a certain strait place, full of evil
snakes, and smitten by those beasts, and thus turning to and fro in that
punishment; and worms, <span id="fr_3892"></span>[3893](#fn_3892.md) as it
were clouds of darkness, afflicted them.  And the souls of the murdered
stood and looked upon the punishment of those murderers and said:  O
God, thy judgment is just.

<span id="v.ii-p30"></span>25.  And near that place I saw another strait
place into which the gore and the filth of those who were being punished
ran down and became there as it were a lake:  and there sat women having
the gore up to their necks, and over against them sat many children who
were born to them out of due time, crying; and there came forth from
them sparks of fire and smote the women in the eyes:  and these were the
accursed who conceived and caused abortion.

<span id="v.ii-p31"></span>26.  And other men and women were burning up
to the middle and were cast into a dark place and were beaten by evil
spirits, and their inwards were eaten by restless worms: <span
id="fr_3893"></span>[3894](#fn_3893.md)   and these were they who
persecuted the righteous and delivered them up.

<span id="v.ii-p33"></span>27.  And near those there were again women
and men gnawing their own lips, and being punished and receiving a
red-hot iron in their eyes:  and these were they who blasphemed and
slandered <span id="fr_3894"></span>[3895](#fn_3894.md) the way of
righteousness.

<span id="v.ii-p35"></span>28.  And over against these again other men
and women gnawing their tongues and having flaming fire in their
mouths:  and these were the false witnesses. <span
id="fr_3895"></span>[3896](#fn_3895.md)

<span id="v.ii-p37"></span>29.  And in a certain other place there were
pebbles sharper than swords or any spit, red-hot, and women and men in
tattered and filthy raiment rolled about on them in punishment:  and
these were the rich who trusted in their riches and had no pity for
orphans and widows, and despised the commandment <span
id="fr_3896"></span>[3897](#fn_3896.md) of God.

<span id="v.ii-p39"></span>30.  And in another great lake, full of pitch
and blood and mire bubbling up, there stood men and women up to their
knees:  and these were the usurers and those who take interest on
interest.

<span id="v.ii-p40"></span>31.  And other men and women were being
hurled down from a great cliff and reached the bottom, and again were
driven by those who were set over them to climb up upon the cliff, and
thence were hurled down again, and had no rest from this punishment: 
and these were they who defiled <span
id="fr_3897"></span>[3898](#fn_3897.md) their bodies acting as women; and
the women who were with them were those who lay with one another as a
man with a woman.

<span id="v.ii-p42"></span>32.  And alongside of that cliff there was a
place full of much fire, and there stood men who with their own hands
had made for themselves carven images instead of God.  And alongside of
these were other men and women, having rods and striking each other and
never ceasing from such punishment.

<span id="v.ii-p43"></span>33.  And others again near them, women and
men, burning and turning themselves and roasting:  and these were they
that leaving the way of God <span id="fr_3898"></span>[3899](#fn_3898.md) …
