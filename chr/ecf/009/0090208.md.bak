<span id="xv.iii.i.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xii-p1.1"></span>12.  The Gospel Contains the Ill Deeds
Also Which Were Done to Jesus.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xii-p2"></span>It ought not to be forgotten that in
such a <span id="page_304">p. 304</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.xii-Page_304"></span>Gospel as this there is embraced every
good deed which was done to Jesus; as, for example, the story of the
woman <span id="fr_4512"></span>[4513](#fn_4512.md) who had been a sinner
and had repented, and who, having experienced a genuine recovery from
her evil state, had grace to pour her ointment over Jesus so that every
one in the house smelt the sweet savour.  Hence, too, the words,
“Wherever this Gospel shall be preached among all the nations, there
also this that she has done shall be spoken of, for a memorial of her.” 
And it is clear that whatever is done to the disciples of Jesus is done
to Him.  Pointing to those of them who met with kind treatment, He says
to those who were kind to them, <span
id="fr_4513"></span>[4514](#fn_4513.md) “What ye did to these, ye did to
Me.”  So that every good deed we do to our neighbours is entered in the
Gospel, that Gospel which is written on the heavenly tablets and read by
all who are worthy of the knowledge of the whole of things.  But on the
other side, too, there is a part of the Gospel which is for the
condemnation of the doers of the ill deeds which have been done to
Jesus.  The treachery of Judas and the shouts of the wicked crowd when
it said, <span id="fr_4514"></span>[4515](#fn_4514.md) “Away with such a
one from the earth,” and “Crucify Him, crucify Him,” the mockings of
those who crowned Him with thorns, and everything of that kind, is
included in the Gospels.  And as a consequence of this we see that every
one who betrays the disciples of Jesus is reckoned as betraying Jesus
Himself.  To Saul, <span id="fr_4515"></span>[4516](#fn_4515.md) when still
a persecutor it is said, “Saul Saul, why persecutest thou Me?” and, “I
am Jesus whom thou persecutest.”  There are those who still have thorns
with which they crown and dishonour Jesus, those, namely, who are choked
by the cares, and riches, and pleasures of life, and though they have
received the word of God, do not bring it to perfection. <span
id="fr_4516"></span>[4517](#fn_4516.md)   We must beware, therefore, lest
we also, as crowning Jesus with thorns of our own, should be entered in
the Gospel and read of in this character by those who learn the Jesus,
who is in all and is present in all rational and holy lives, learn how
He is anointed with ointment, is entertained, is glorified, or how, on
the other side, He is dishonoured, and mocked, and beaten.  All this had
to be said; it is part of our demonstration that our good actions, and
also the sins of those who stumble, are embodied in the Gospel, either
to everlasting life or to reproach and everlasting shame.
