<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>15.  Greatness Varies in Degree.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xv-p2"></span>But next we must seek to understand
this:  the disciples came to Him, as disciples to a teacher proposing
difficult questions, and making inquiry, Who then is greatest in the
kingdom of heaven? <span id="fr_5919"></span>[5920](#fn_5919.md)   And, in
this respect, we must imitate the disciples of Jesus; for if, at any
time, any subject of investigation among us should not be found out let
us go with all unanimity in regard to the question in dispute to Jesus,
who is present where two or three are gathered together in His
name, <span id="fr_5920"></span>[5921](#fn_5920.md) and is ready by His
presence with power to illumine the hearts of those who truly desire to
become His disciples, with a view to their apprehension of the matters
under inquiry.  And likewise it would be nothing strange for us to go to
any of those who have been appointed by God as teachers in the church,
and propose any question of a like order to this, “Who, then, is
greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”  What, then, was already known to
the disciples of the matters relating to this question?  And what was
the point under inquiry?  That there is not equality in regard to those
who are deemed worthy of the kingdom of heaven they had apprehended, and
that, as there was not equality, some one was greatest, and so in
succession down to the least:  but of what nature was the greatest, and
what was the way of life of him who was the least, and who occupied the
middle position, they further desired to know; unless, indeed, it is
more accurate to say that they knew who was least from the words,
“Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach
men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;” but who was the
greatest of all they did not know, even if they had grasped the meaning
of the words, “Whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be
called great in the kingdom of heaven;” <span
id="fr_5921"></span>[5922](#fn_5921.md) for as there were many great, it
was not clear to them who was the greatest of the great, to use a human
standard.  And that many are great, but the great not equally great,
will be manifest from the ascription of the epithet “great” to Isaac,
“who waxed great, and became exceedingly great,” <span
id="fr_5922"></span>[5923](#fn_5922.md) and from what is said in the case
of Moses, and John the Baptist, and the Saviour.  And every one will
acknowledge that even though all these were great according to the
Scripture, yet the Saviour was greater than they.  But whether John also
(than whom there was no greater among those born of women), <span
id="fr_5923"></span>[5924](#fn_5923.md) was greater than Isaac and Moses,
or whether he was not greater, but equal to both, or to one of them, it
would be hazardous to declare.  And from the saying, “But Isaac, waxing
great, became greater,” <span id="fr_5924"></span>[5925](#fn_5924.md) until
he became not simply great, but with the twice repeated addition,
“exceedingly,” we may learn that there is a difference among the great,
as one is great, and another exceedingly great, and another exceedingly
exceedingly great.  The disciples, therefore, came to Jesus and sought
to learn, who was the greatest in the kingdom of heaven; and perhaps
they wished to learn, hearing from <span id="page_484">p. 484</span>
<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xv-Page_484"></span>Him sometimes like this, “A
certain one is greatest in the kingdom of heaven;” but He gives a
universal turn to the discourse, showing what was the quality of him who
was greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  Let us seek to understand, from
what is written, to the best of our ability, who this is.  “For Jesus
called a little child,” <span id="fr_5925"></span>[5926](#fn_5925.md) etc.
