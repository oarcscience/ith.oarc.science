<p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.vii.vi-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.vii.vi-p1.1"></A>6.&#160; Concerning the King Who Made a Reckoning with His Own Servants, to Whom Was Brought a Man Who Owed Ten Thousand Talents.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.vii.vi-p2"></A>&#8220;<i>Therefore I say unto you the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, who wished to make a reckoning with his own servants.</i>&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6073"></A><A HREF="#fn_6073"><FONT SIZE="1">6074</FONT></A>
&#160; The general conception of the parable is to teach us that we should be inclined to forgive the sins committed against us by those who have wronged us, and especially if after the wrongdoing he who has done it supplicates him who has been wronged, asking forgiveness for the sins which he has committed against him.&#160; And this the parable wishes to teach us by representing that even when forgiveness has been granted by God to us of the sins in respect of which we have received remission, exaction will be demanded even after the remission, unless we forgive the sins of those who have wronged us, so that there is no longer left in us the least remembrance of the wrong that was done, but the whole heart, assisted by the spirit of forgetfulness of wrongs, which is no common virtue, forgives him who has wronged us those things which have been wickedly done against any of us by him, even treacherously.&#160; But next to the general conception of the parable, it is right to examine the whole of it more simply according to the letter, so that he who advances with care to the right investigation of each detail of the things previously written may derive profit from the examination of what is said.&#160; Now there is, as is probable, an interpretation, transcendental and hard to trace, as it is somewhat mystical, according to which, after the analogy of the parables which are interpreted by the Evangelists, one would investigate each of the details in this; as, for example, who the king was, and who the servants were, and what was the beginning of his making a reckoning, and who was the one debtor who owed many talents, and who was his wife and who his children, and what were the &#8220;all things&#8221; spoken of besides those which the king ordered to be sold in order that the debt might be paid out of his belongings, and what was meant by the going out of the man who had been forgiven the many talents, and who was the one of the servants who was found and was a debtor not to the householder, but to the man who had been forgiven, and what is meant by the number of the hundred pence, and what by the word, &#8220;He took him by the throat saying, Pay what thou owest,&#8221; and what is the prison into which he who had been forgiven all the talents went out and cast his fellow-servant, and who were the fellow-servants who were grieved and told the lord all that had been done, and who were the tormentors to whom he who had cast his fellow-servant into prison was delivered, and how he who was delivered to the tormentors paid all that was due, so <A NAME="page_498"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 498</FONT></A> <a name="xvi.ii.vii.vi-Page_498"></A>that he no longer owed anything.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6074"></A><A HREF="#fn_6074"><FONT SIZE="1">6075</FONT></A>
&#160; But it is probable also that some other things could be added to the number by a more competent investigator, the exposition and interpretation of which I think to be beyond the power of man, and requiring the Spirit of Christ who spoke them in order that Christ may be understood as He spoke; for as &#8220;no one among men knows the things of the man, save the spirit which is in him,&#8221; and &#8220;no one knows the things of God, save the Spirit of God,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6075"></A><A HREF="#fn_6075"><FONT SIZE="1">6076</FONT></A>
 so no one knows after God the things spoken by Christ in proverbs and parables save the Spirit of Christ, in which he who participates in Christ not only so far as He is Spirit, but in Christ as He is Wisdom, as He is Word, would behold the things which were revealed to him in this passage.&#160; But with regard to the interpretation of the loftiest type, we make no profession; nor on the other hand with the assistance of Christ who is the Wisdom of God do we despair of apprehending the things signified in the parable; but whether it shall be the case that such things shall be dictated to us in connection with this Scripture or not, may God in Christ suggest the doing of that which is pleasing to Him, if only there be granted to us also concerning these things, the word of wisdom which is given from God through the Spirit, and the word of knowledge which is supplied according to the Spirit.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6076"></A><A HREF="#fn_6076"><FONT SIZE="1">6077</FONT></A>
