<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xxi-p1.1"></span>21.  Union of Angels and the Souls of
Men.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xxi-p2"></span>But some one may inquire whether the
human soul can be figuratively called a wife, and the angel who is set
over her and is her ruler, with whom as her sovereign she holds
conversation, can be called her husband; so that according to this each
lawfully dwells along with the soul which is worthy of the guardianship
of a divine angel; but sometimes after long sojourning and intercourse a
cause may arise in the soul why she does not find favour in the eyes of
the angel who is her lord and ruler, because that in it there is found
an unseemly thing; and bonds may be written out, as such are written,
and a bill of divorcement be written and put into the hands of her who
is cast out, so that she may no longer be familiar with her former
guardian, when she is cast out from his dwelling.  And even she who has
gone away from her former dwelling may be joined to another husband, and
be unfortunate with him, not only, as in the case of the former, not
finding favour in his sight because an unseemly thing was found in her,
but even being hated by him. <span id="fr_6209"></span>[6210](#fn_6209.md)
  Yea, and even there might be written out from the second husband a
bill of divorcement and it might be put into her hands from the last
husband who sends her away from his dwelling.  But whether there can be
such a change of the life of angels with men, as to amount, so far as
concerns their relation to us, to their death, one may put the question
rash though it be; but be that as it may, she also who has once fallen
away from the former husband will not return again to him, for the
former husband who sent her away will not be able to turn back and take
her as wife to himself, after she was defiled. <span
id="fr_6210"></span>[6211](#fn_6210.md)   And if one should dare, using a
Scripture which is in circulation in the church, but not acknowledged by
all to be divine, to soften down a precept of this kind, the passage
might be taken from The Shepherd, concerning some who as soon as they
believe are put in subjection to Michael, <span
id="fr_6211"></span>[6212](#fn_6211.md) but falling away from him from love
of pleasure, are put in subjection to the angel of luxury, <span
id="fr_6212"></span>[6213](#fn_6212.md) then to the angel of
punishment, <span id="fr_6213"></span>[6214](#fn_6213.md) and after this to
the angel of repentance; for you observe that the wife or soul who has
once been given to luxury no longer returns to the first ruler, but also
besides suffering punishment, is put in subjection to one inferior to
Michael; for the angel of penitence is inferior to him.  We must
therefore take heed lest there be found in us any unseemly thing, and we
should not find favour in the eyes of our husband Christ, or of the
angel who has been set over us.  For if we do not take heed, perhaps we
also shall receive the bill of divorcement, and either be bereft of our
guardian, or go to another man.  But I consider that it is not of good
omen to receive, as it were, the marriage of an angel with our own
soul. <span id="fr_6214"></span>[6215](#fn_6214.md)

Perhaps it means the marriage of a *second* angel with our soul.
