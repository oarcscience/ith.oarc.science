<span id="xvi.ii.v.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xx-p1.1"></span>20.  Why Jesus Had to Go to
Jerusalem.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xx-p2"></span>“*Then began He to show;”* <span
id="fr_5684"></span>[5685](#fn_5684.md) and probably afterwards when they
were able to receive it He shewed more clearly, no longer beginning to
show as to those who were learning the introduction, but already also
advancing in the showing; and if it is reasonable to conceive that Jesus
altogether completed what He began, then, some time, He altogether
completed that which He began to show to His disciples about the
necessity of His suffering the things which <span id="page_462">p.
462</span> <span id="xvi.ii.v.xx-Page_462"></span>are written.  For,
when any one apprehends from the Word the perfect knowledge of these
things, then it must be said that, from a rational exhibition (the mind
seeing the things which are shown,) the exhibition becomes complete for
him who has the will and the power to contemplate these things, and does
contemplate them.  But since “it cannot be that a prophet perish out of
Jerusalem,” <span id="fr_5685"></span>[5686](#fn_5685.md) —a perishing
which corresponds to the words, “He that loseth his life for My sake
shall find it,” <span id="fr_5686"></span>[5687](#fn_5686.md) —on this
account it was necessary for Him to go to Jerusalem, that having
suffered many things in that Jerusalem, He might make “the
first-fruits” <span id="fr_5687"></span>[5688](#fn_5687.md) of the
resurrection from the dead in the Jerusalem above, doing away with and
breaking up the city upon the earth with all the worship which was
maintained in it.  For so long as Christ “had not been raised from the
dead, the first-fruits of them that are asleep,” <span
id="fr_5688"></span>[5689](#fn_5688.md) and those who become conformed to
His death and resurrection had not yet been raised along with Him, the
city of God was sought for below, and the temple, and the purifications,
and the rest; but when this took place, no longer were the things below
sought for, but the things above; and, in order that these might be set
up, it was necessary that He should go unto the Jerusalem below, and
there suffer many things from the elders in it, and the chief priests
and scribes of the people, in order that He might be glorified by the
heavenly elders who could receive his bounties, and by diviner
high-priests who are ordained under the one High-Priest, and that He
might be glorified by the scribes of the people who are occupied with
letters “not written with ink” <span
id="fr_5689"></span>[5690](#fn_5689.md) but made clear by the Spirit of the
living God, and might be killed in the Jerusalem below, and having risen
from the dead might reign in Mount Zion, and the city of the living
God—the heavenly Jerusalem. <span id="fr_5690"></span>[5691](#fn_5690.md)  
But on the third day He rose from the dead, <span
id="fr_5691"></span>[5692](#fn_5691.md) in order that having delivered them
from the wicked one, and his son, <span
id="fr_5692"></span>[5693](#fn_5692.md) in whom was falsehood and
unrighteousness and war and everything opposed to that which Christ is,
and also from the profane spirit who transforms himself into the Holy
Spirit, He might gain for those who had been delivered the right to be
baptized in spirit and soul and body, into the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit, which represent the three days eternally
present at the same time to those who by means of them are sons of
light.
