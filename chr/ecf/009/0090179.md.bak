<span id="xii.vi.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Same Subject
Continued.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.xvii-p2"></span>Let us, then, repent with our whole
heart, that no one of us may perish amiss.  For if we have commands and
engage in withdrawing from idols and instructing others, how much more
ought a soul already knowing God not to perish.  Rendering, therefore,
mutual help, let us raise the weak also in that which is good, that all
of us may be saved and convert one another and admonish.  And not only
now let us seem to believe and give heed, when we are admonished by the
elders; <span id="fr_4404"></span>[4405](#fn_4404.md) but also when we take
our departure home, let us remember the commandments of the Lord, and
not be allured back by worldly lusts, but let us often and often draw
near and try to make progress in the Lord’s commands, that we all having
the same mind may be gathered together for life.  For the Lord said, “I
come to gather all nations \[kindreds\] and tongues.” <span
id="fr_4405"></span>[4406](#fn_4405.md)   This means the day of His
appearing, when He will come and redeem us—each one according to his
works.  And the unbelievers will see His glory and might, and, when they
see the empire of the world in Jesus, they will be surprised, saying,
“Woe to us, because Thou wast, and we knew not and believed not and
obeyed not the elders <span id="fr_4406"></span>[4407](#fn_4406.md) who
show us <span id="page_256">p. 256</span> <span
id="xii.vi.xvii-Page_256"></span>plainly of our salvation.”  And “their
worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall
be a spectacle unto all flesh.” <span
id="fr_4407"></span>[4408](#fn_4407.md)   It is of the great day of
judgment He speaks, when they shall see those among us who were guilty
of ungodliness and erred in their estimate of the commands of Jesus
Christ.  The righteous, having succeeded both in enduring the trials and
hating the indulgences of the soul, whenever they witness how those who
have swerved and denied Jesus by words or deeds are punished with
grievous torments in fire unquenchable, will give glory to their God and
say, “There will be hope for him who has served God with his whole
heart.”
