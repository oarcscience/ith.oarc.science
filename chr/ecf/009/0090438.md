<span id="xvi.ii.v.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xli-p1.1"></span>41.  Figurative Interpretation of the
Same.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xli-p2"></span>But since we have not yet spent our
energy in interpreting the things in the place figuratively, but have
said these things by way of searching into the mere letter, let us in
conformity with these things, consider whether the aforesaid Peter and
the sons of thunder who were taken up into the mountain of the dogmas of
the truth, and who saw the transfiguration of Jesus and of Moses and
Elijah, who appeared in glory with Him, might wish to make tabernacles
in themselves for the Word of God who was going to dwell in them, and
for His law which had been beholden in glory, and for the prophecy which
spake of the decease of Jesus, which He was about to accomplish; <span
id="fr_5805"></span>[5806](#fn_5805.md) and Peter, as one loving the
contemplative life, and having preferred that which was delightsome in
it to the life among the crowd with its turmoil, said, with the design
of benefiting those who desired it, “It is good for us to be
here.” <span id="fr_5806"></span>[5807](#fn_5806.md)   But since “love
seeketh not its own,” <span id="fr_5807"></span>[5808](#fn_5807.md) Jesus
did not do that which Peter thought good; wherefore He descended from
the mountain to those who were not able to ascend to it and behold His
transfiguration, that they might behold Him in such form as they were
able to see Him.  It is, therefore, the part of a righteous man who
possesses “the love which seeketh not its own” <span
id="fr_5808"></span>[5809](#fn_5808.md) to be free from all, but to bring
himself under bondage to all those below that He might gain the more of
them. <span id="fr_5809"></span>[5810](#fn_5809.md)   But some one, with
reference to what we have alleged about the trance and the working of an
evil spirit in Peter, concerning the words, “not knowing what he
said,” <span id="fr_5810"></span>[5811](#fn_5810.md) not accepting that
interpretation of ours, may say that there were certain mentioned by
Paul “desiring to be teachers of the law,” <span
id="fr_5811"></span>[5812](#fn_5811.md) who do not know about what they
speak, but who, though they do not clearly expound the nature of what is
said, nor understand their meaning, make confident affirmations of
things which they do not know.  Of such a nature was the affection of
Peter also, for not apprehending what was good with reference to the
dispensation of Jesus and of those who appeared in the mountain,—Moses
and Elijah,—he says, “It is good for us to be here,” etc., “not knowing
what he said,” “for he wist not what to say,” for if “a wise man will
understand the things from his own mouth, and carries prudence in his
lips,” <span id="fr_5812"></span>[5813](#fn_5812.md) he who is not so does
not understand the things from his own mouth, nor comprehend the nature
of the things spoken by him.
