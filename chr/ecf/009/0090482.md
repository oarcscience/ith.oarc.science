<span id="xvi.ii.vii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.ix-p1.1"></span>9.  The Time Occupied by the
Reckoning.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.ix-p2"></span>And these things will take place
whenever that happens which is written in Daniel, “The books were opened
and the judgment was set;” <span id="fr_6095"></span>[6096](#fn_6095.md)
for a record, as it were, is made of all things that have been spoken
and done and thought, and by divine power every hidden thing of ours
shall be manifested, and everything that is covered shall be
revealed, <span id="fr_6096"></span>[6097](#fn_6096.md) in order that when
any one is found who has not “given diligence to be freed from the
adversary,” he may go in succession through the hands <span
id="page_500">p. 500</span> <span id="xvi.ii.vii.ix-Page_500"></span>of
the magistrate, and the judge, and the attendant into the prison, until
he pays the very last mite; <span id="fr_6097"></span>[6098](#fn_6097.md)
but when one has given diligence to be freed from him and owes nothing
to any one, and already has made the pound ten pounds or five pounds, or
doubled the five talents, or made the two four, he may obtain the due
recompense, entering into the joy of his Lord, either being set over all
His possessions, <span id="fr_6098"></span>[6099](#fn_6098.md) or hearing
the word, “Have thou authority over ten cities,” <span
id="fr_6099"></span>[6100](#fn_6099.md) or “Have thou authority over five
cities.” <span id="fr_6100"></span>[6101](#fn_6100.md)   But we think that
these things are spoken of as if they required a long period of time, in
order that an account may be made by us of the whole times of the
earthly life, so that we might suppose that when the king makes a
reckoning with each one of his many servants the matter would require so
vast a period of time, until these things come to an end which have
existed from the beginning of the world down to the consummation of the
age, not of one age, but of many ages.  But the truth is not so; for
when God wished all at once to rekindle in the memories of all
everything that had been done by each one throughout the whole time, in
order that each might become conscious of his own doings whether good or
bad, He would do it by His ineffable power.  For it is not with God as
with us; for if we wish to call some things to remembrance, we require
sufficient time for the detailed account of what has been said by us,
and to bring to our remembrance the things which we wish to remember;
but if He wished to call to our memory the things which have been done
in this life, in order that becoming conscious of what we have done we
may apprehend for what we are punished or honoured, He could do so.  But
if any one disbelieves the swiftness of the power of God in regard to
these matters, he has not yet had a true conception of the God who made
the universe, who did not require times to make the vast creation of
heaven and earth and the things in them; for, though He may seem to have
made these things in six days, there is need of understanding to
comprehend in what sense the words “in six days” are said, on account of
this, “This is the book of the generation of heaven and earth,” <span
id="fr_6101"></span>[6102](#fn_6101.md) etc.  Therefore it may be boldly
affirmed that the season of the expected judgment does not require
times, but as the resurrection is said to take place “in a moment, in
the twinkling of an eye,” <span id="fr_6102"></span>[6103](#fn_6102.md) so
I think will the judgment also be.
