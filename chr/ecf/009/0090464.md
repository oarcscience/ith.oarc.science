<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>23.  In What Sense “Necessary.”</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxiii-p2"></span>Next we must test accurately the
meaning of the word “necessity” in the passage, “*For there is a
necessity that the occasions come,*” <span
id="fr_5967"></span>[5968](#fn_5967) and to the like effect in Luke, “It
is ‘inadmissible’ but that occasions of stumbling should come,” <span
id="fr_5968"></span>[5969](#fn_5968) instead of “impossible.”  And as it
is necessary that that which is mortal should die, and it is impossible
but that it should die, and as it must needs be that he who is in the
body should be fed, for it is impossible for one who is not fed to live,
so it is necessary and impossible but that occasions of stumbling should
arise, since there is a necessity also that wickedness should exist
before virtue in men, from which wickedness stumbling-blocks arise; for
it is impossible that a man should be found altogether sinless, and who,
<span id="page_489">p. 489</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxiii-Page_489"></span>without sin, has attained to
virtue.  For the wickedness in the evil powers, which is the primal
source of the wickedness among men, is altogether eager to work through
certain instruments against the men in the world.  And perhaps also the
wicked powers are more exasperated when they are cast out by the word of
Jesus, and their worship is lessened, their customary sacrifices not
being offered unto them; and there is a necessity that these offences
come; but there is no necessity that they should come through any
particular one; wherefore the “woe” falls on the man through whom the
stumbling-block comes, as he has given a place to the wicked power whose
purpose it is to create a stumbling-block.  But do not suppose that by
nature, and from constitution, there are certain stumbling-blocks which
seek out men through whom they come; for as God did not make death, so
neither did He create stumbling-blocks; but free-will begot the
stumbling-blocks in some who did not wish to endure toils for virtue.
