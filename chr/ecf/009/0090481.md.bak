<span id="xvi.ii.vii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.viii-p1.1"></span>8.  The Principle of the
Reckoning.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.viii-p2"></span>But you will here inquire whether
all men can be called servants of the king, or some are servants whom he
foreknew and fore-ordained, while there are others who transact business
with the servants, and are called bankers. <span
id="fr_6087"></span>[6088](#fn_6087.md)   And in like manner you will
inquire if there are those outside the number of the slaves from whom
the householder declares that he will exact his own with usury, not only
men alien from piety, but also some of the believers.  Now the servants
alone are the stewards of the Word, but the king, making a reckoning
with the servants, demands from those who have borrowed from the
servants, whether a hundred measures of wheat or a hundred measures of
oil, <span id="fr_6088"></span>[6089](#fn_6088.md) or whatever in point of
fact those who are outside of the household of the king have received;
for he who owed the hundred measures of wheat or the hundred measures of
oil is not found to be, according to the parable, a fellow-servant of
the unjust steward, as is evident from the question—how much owest thou
to my lord? <span id="fr_6089"></span>[6090](#fn_6089.md)   But mark with
me that each deed which is good or seemly is like a gain and an
increment, but a wicked deed is like a loss; and as there is a certain
gain when the money is greater and another when it is less, and as there
are differences of more or less, so according to the good deeds, there
is as it were a valuing of gains more or less.  To reckon what work is a
great gain, and what a less gain, and what a least, is the prerogative
of him who alone knows to investigate such things, looking at them in
the light of the disposition, and the word, and the deed, and from
consideration of the things which are not in our power cooperating with
those that are; and so also in the case of things opposite, it is his to
say what sin, when a reckoning is made with the servants, is found to be
a great loss, and what is less, and what, if we may so call it, is the
loss of the very last mite, <span id="fr_6090"></span>[6091](#fn_6090.md)
or the last farthing. <span id="fr_6091"></span>[6092](#fn_6091.md)   The
account, therefore, of the entire and whole life is exacted by that
which is called the kingdom of heaven which is likened to a king, when
“we must all stand before the judgment-sent of Christ that each one may
receive the things done in the body according to what he hath done,
whether good or bad;” <span id="fr_6092"></span>[6093](#fn_6092.md) and
then when the reckoning is being made, shall there be brought into the
reckoning that is made also every idle word that men shall speak, <span
id="fr_6093"></span>[6094](#fn_6093.md) and any cup of cold water only
which one has given to drink in the name of a disciple. <span
id="fr_6094"></span>[6095](#fn_6094.md)
