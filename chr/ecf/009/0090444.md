id="xvi.ii.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>3.  Concerning the Epileptic.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.iii-p2"></span>“*And when they were come to the
multitude, there came to Him a man kneeling to Him and saying, Lord,
have mercy upon my son.*” <span id="fr_5861"></span>[5862](#fn_5861)  
Those who are suffering, or the kinsfolk of the sufferers, are along
with the multitudes; wherefore, when He has dispensed the things that
were beyond the multitudes, He descends to them, so that those, who were
not able to ascend because of the sicknesses that repressed their soul,
might be benefited when the Word descended to them from the loftier
regions.  But we ought to make inquiry, in respect of what diseases the
sufferers believe and pray for their own healing, and in respect of what
diseases others do this for them, as, for example, the centurion for his
servant, and the nobleman for his son, and the ruler of the synagogue
for a daughter, and the Canaanitish woman for her female child who was
vexed with a demon, and now the man who kneels to Him on behalf of his
epileptic son.  And along with these you will investigate when the
Saviour heals of Himself and unasked by any one, as for example, the
paralytic; for these cures, when compared with one another for this very
purpose, and examined together, will exhibit to him who is able to hear
“the wisdom of God hidden in a mystery,” <span
id="fr_5862"></span>[5863](#fn_5862) many dogmas concerning the
different diseases of souls, as well as the method of their healing.
