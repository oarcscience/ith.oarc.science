<span id="xv.iii.v.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.xxxv-p1.1"></span>35.  Jesus is a Lamb in Respect of His
Human Nature.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxxv-p2"></span>If we enquire further into the
significance of Jesus being pointed out by John, when he says, “This is
the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world,” we may take our
stand at the dispensation of the bodily advent of the Son of God in
human life, and in that case we shall conceive the lamb to be no other
than the man.  For the man “was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and
as a lamb, dumb before his shearers,” <span
id="fr_4959"></span>[4960](#fn_4959) saying, “I was as like a gentle
lamb led to the slaughter.” <span id="fr_4960"></span>[4961](#fn_4960)  
Hence, too, in the Apocalypse <span id="fr_4961"></span>[4962](#fn_4961)
a lamb is seen, standing as if slain.  This slain lamb has been made,
according to certain hidden reasons, a purification of the whole world,
for which, according to the Father’s love to man, He submitted to death,
purchasing us back by His own blood from him who had got us into his
power, sold under sin.  And He who led this lamb to the slaughter was
God in man, the great High-Priest, as he shows by the words: <span
id="fr_4962"></span>[4963](#fn_4962)   “No one taketh My life away from
Me, but I lay it down of Myself.  I have power to lay it down, and I
have power to take it again.”
