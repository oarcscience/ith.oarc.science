id="xvi.ii.vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>13.  The Sacred Half-Shekel.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xiii-p2"></span>Moreover to the saying, “They that
received the half-shekel came to Peter,” <span
id="fr_5913"></span>[5914](#fn_5913.md) you will adduce from Numbers that,
for the saints according to the law of God, is paid not a half-shekel
simply, but a sacred half-shekel.  For it is written, “And thou shalt
take five shekels per head, according to the sacred half-shekel.” <span
id="fr_5914"></span>[5915](#fn_5914.md)   But also on behalf of all the
sons of Israel is given a sacred half-shekel per head.  Since then it
was not possible for the saint of God to possess along with the sacred
half-shekels the profane shekels, so to speak, on this account, to them
who do not receive the sacred half-shekels, and who asked Peter and
said, “Doth not your master pay the half-shekel?” the Saviour commands
the stater to be paid, in which was the half-shekel which was found in
the mouth of the first fish that came up, in order that it might be
given for the Teacher and the disciple.
