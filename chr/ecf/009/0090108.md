id="xii.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—An Exhortation to
Humility.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xiii-p2"></span>Let us therefore, brethren, be of
humble mind, laying aside all haughtiness, and pride, and foolishness,
and angry feelings; and let us act according to that which is written
(for the Holy Spirit saith, “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
neither let the mighty man glory in his might, neither let the rich man
glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth glory in the Lord, in
diligently seeking Him, and doing judgment and righteousness” <span
id="fr_4059"></span>[4060](#fn_4059) .md), being especially mindful of the
words of the Lord Jesus which He spake teaching us meekness and
long-suffering.  For thus He spoke:  “Be ye merciful, that ye may obtain
mercy; forgive, that it may be forgiven to you; as ye do, so shall it be
done unto you; as ye judge, so shall ye be judged; as ye are kind, so
shall kindness be shown to you; with what measure ye mete, with the same
it shall be measured to you.” <span id="fr_4060"></span>[4061](#fn_4060.md)
  By this precept and by these rules let us stablish ourselves, that we
walk with all humility in obedience to His holy words.  For the holy
word saith, “On whom shall I look, but on him that is meek and
peaceable, and that trembleth at my words?” <span
