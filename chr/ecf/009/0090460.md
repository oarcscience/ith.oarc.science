<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xix-p1.1"></span>19.  The Parallel Passages in Mark and
Luke.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xix-p2"></span>But let us consider also the like
account in the other Evangelists.  Mark, <span
id="fr_5938"></span>[5939](#fn_5938.md) then, says, that the Twelve
reasoned in the way as to which of them was the greatest.  Wherefore He
sat down, and called them, and teaches who is the greatest, saying, that
he who became last of all by means of his moderation and gentleness,
would as the greatest obtain the first place, so that he did not receive
the place of one who was being ministered unto, but the place of one who
ministered, and that not to some but not to others, but to all
absolutely; for attend to the words, “If any man would be first he shall
be last of all, and minister of all.” <span
id="fr_5939"></span>[5940](#fn_5939.md)   And next to that He says, that
“He,”—Jesus to-wit—“took a little child, and set him in the midst of His
own disciples, and taking him in His arms, He said unto them, Whosoever
shall receive one of the little children in My name receiveth Me.” <span
id="fr_5940"></span>[5941](#fn_5940.md)   But what was the little child
which Jesus took and placed in His arms, according to the deeper meaning
in the passage?  Was it the Holy Spirit?  And to this little child,
indeed, some were likened, of whom He said, “Whosoever shall receive one
of such little children in My name receiveth Me.”  According to Luke,
however, the reasoning did not arise spontaneously in the disciples, but
was suggested to them by the question, “which of them should be
greatest.” <span id="fr_5941"></span>[5942](#fn_5941.md)   And Jesus,
seeing the reasoning of their heart, as He had eyes that see the
reasonings of hearts,—seeing the reasoning of their heart,—without being
questioned, according to Luke, “took the little child and set him,” not
in the midst alone, as Matthew and Mark have said, but now, also, “by
His side,” and said to the disciples, not only, “Whosoever shall receive
one such little child,” or, “Whosoever shall receive one of such little
ones in My name receiveth Me,” but, now going even a step higher,
“Whosoever shall receive this little child in My name receiveth
Me.” <span id="fr_5942"></span>[5943](#fn_5942.md)   It is necessary,
therefore, according to Luke, to receive in the name of Jesus that very
little child which Jesus took and placed by His side.  And I know not if
there be any one who can interpret figuratively the word, “Whosoever
shall receive this little child in My name.”  For it is necessary that
each of us should receive in the name of Jesus that little child which
Jesus then took and set by His side; for he lives as immortal, and we
must receive him from Jesus Himself in the name of Jesus; and without
being separated from him, Jesus is with him who receives the little
child, so that according to this it is said, “Whosoever shall receive
this little child in My name receiveth Me.”  Then, since the Father is
inseparable from the Son, He is with him who receives the Son. 
Wherefore it is said, “And whosoever shall receive Me receives Him that
sent Me.” <span id="fr_5943"></span>[5944](#fn_5943.md)   But he who has
received the little child, and the Saviour, and Him that sent Him, is
least of all the disciples of Jesus, making himself little.  But, so far
as <span id="page_487">p. 487</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xix-Page_487"></span>he belittles himself, to that extent
does he become great; as that very thing, which caused him the more to
make himself little, contributes to his advance in greatness; for attend
to what is said, “He that is least among you all the same is great;” but
in other manuscripts we read, “The same shall be great.”  Now, according
to Luke, “If any one shall not receive the kingdom of God as the little
child, he shall in no wise enter therein.” <span
id="fr_5944"></span>[5945](#fn_5944.md)   And this expression is ambiguous;
for either it means that he who receives the kingdom of God may become
as a little child, or, that he may receive the kingdom of God, which has
become to him as a little child.  And perhaps here those who receive the
kingdom of God receive it, when it is as a little child, but in the
world to come no longer as a little child; and they receive the
greatness of the perfection in the spiritual manhood, so to speak, which
perfection is manifested to all who in the present time receive it, when
it is here as a little child.
