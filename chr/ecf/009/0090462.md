<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxi-p1.1"></span>21.  The “Woe” Does Not Apply to the
Disciples of Jesus.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxi-p2"></span>But if there is woe unto men
everywhere on the earth, because of occasions of stum<span
id="page_488">p. 488</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxi-Page_488"></span>bling to those who are laid hold of
by them; but the disciples are not of the world, as they do not look at
things seen, like as the Master is not of this world; to no one of the
disciples of Jesus does the “woe because of occasions of stumbling”
apply, since “great peace have they who love the law of God, and there
is to them no occasion of stumbling.” <span
id="fr_5958"></span>[5959](#fn_5958)   But if any one seems to be called
a disciple, but yet is of the world, because of his loving the world,
and the things therein,—I mean, the life in the place round about the
earth, and the property in it, or the possessions, or any form of wealth
whatsoever,—so that the saying, “they are not of the world,” <span
id="fr_5959"></span>[5960](#fn_5959) does not fit him; to him, as being
really of the world, shall come that which happens to the world, the
“woe, because of occasions of stumbling.”  But let him who wishes to
avoid this woe not be a lover of life, but let him say with Paul,” “The
world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.” <span
id="fr_5960"></span>[5961](#fn_5960)   For the saints while “in the
tabernacle, do groan being burdened” <span
id="fr_5961"></span>[5962](#fn_5961) with “the body of humiliation,” and
do all things that they may become worthy to be found in the mystery of
the resurrection, when God shall fashion anew the body of humiliation
not of all, but of those who have been truly made disciples to Christ,
so that it may be conformed to the body of the glory of Christ. <span
id="fr_5962"></span>[5963](#fn_5962)   For as none of the “woes” happen
to any of the disciples of Christ, so does not this “woe, because of
occasions of stumbling;” for, supposing that thousands of occasions
should arise, they shall not touch those who are no longer of the
world.  But if any one, because of his faith wanting ballast, and the
instability of his submission in regard to the Word of God, is capable
of being caused to stumble, let him know that he is not called by Jesus
His disciple.  Now we must suppose that so many stumbling-blocks come,
that, as a result, the woes extend not to some parts of the earth, but
to the whole “world” which is in it.
