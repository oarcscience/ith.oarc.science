<span id="xv.iii.v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.viii-p1.1"></span>8.  John is a Prophet, But Not the
Prophet.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.viii-p2"></span>“Art thou that prophet?  And he
answered No.” <span id="fr_4856"></span>[4857](#fn_4856)   If the law
and the prophets were until John, <span
id="fr_4857"></span>[4858](#fn_4857) what can we say that John was but a
prophet?  His father Zacharias, indeed, says, filled with the Holy Ghost
and prophesying, <span id="fr_4858"></span>[4859](#fn_4858) “And thou,
child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest, for thou shalt go
before the Lord to prepare His ways.”  (One might indeed get past this
passage by laying stress on the word called:  he is to be called, he is
not said to be, a prophet.)  And still more weighty is it that the
Saviour said to those who considered John to be a prophet, <span
id="fr_4859"></span>[4860](#fn_4859) “But what went ye out to see?  A
prophet?  Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.”  The words,
Yea, I say unto you, manifestly affirm that John is a prophet, and that
is nowhere denied afterwards.  If, then, he is said by the Saviour to be
not only a prophet but “more than a prophet,” how is it that when the
priests and levites come and ask him, “Art thou the Prophet?” he answers
No!  On this we must remark that it is not the same thing to say, “Art
thou the Prophet?” and “Art thou a prophet?”  The distinction between
the two expressions has already been observed, when we asked what was
the difference between the God and God, and between the Logos and
Logos. <span id="fr_4860"></span>[4861](#fn_4860)   Now it is written in
Deuteronomy, <span id="fr_4861"></span>[4862](#fn_4861) “A prophet shall
the Lord your God raise up unto you, like me; Him shall ye hear, and it
shall be that every soul that will not hear that prophet shall be cut
off from among His people.”  There was, therefore, an expectation of one
particular prophet having a resemblance to Moses in mediating between
God and the people and receiving a new covenant from God to give to
those who accepted his teaching; and in the case of each of the
prophets, the people of Israel recognized that he was not the person of
whom Moses spoke.  As, then, they doubted about John, whether he were
not the Christ, <span id="fr_4862"></span>[4863](#fn_4862) so they
doubted whether he could not be the prophet.  And there is no wonder
that those who doubted about John whether he were the Christ, did not
understand that the Christ and the prophet are the same person; their
doubt as to John necessarily implied that they were not clear on this
point.  Now the difference between “the prophet” and “a prophet” has
escaped the observation of most students; this is the case with
Heracleon, who says, in these very words:  “As, then, John confessed
that he was not the Christ, and not even a prophet, nor Elijah.”  If he
interpreted the words before us in such a way, he ought to have examined
the various passages to see whether in saying that he is not a prophet
nor Elijah he is or is not saying what is true.  He devotes no
attention, however, to these passages, and in his remaining commentaries
he passes over such points without any enquiry.  In the sequel, too, his
remarks, of which we shall have to speak directly, are very scanty, and
do not testify to careful study.
