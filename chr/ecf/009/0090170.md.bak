id="xii.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The Necessity of Repentance
While We are on Earth.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.viii-p2"></span>As long, therefore, as we are upon
earth, let us practise repentance, for we are as clay in the hand of the
artificer.  For as the potter, if he make a vessel, and it be distorted
or broken in his hands, fashions it over again; but if he have before
this cast it into the furnace of fire, can no longer find any help for
it:  so let us also, while we are in this world, repent with our whole
heart of the evil deeds we have done in the flesh, that we may be saved
by the Lord, while we have yet an opportunity of repentance.  For after
we have gone out of the world, no further power of confessing or
repenting will there belong to us.  Wherefore, brethren, by doing the
will of the Father, and keeping the flesh holy, and observing the
commandments of the Lord, we shall obtain eternal life.  For the Lord
saith in the Gospel, “If ye have not kept that which was small, who will
commit to you the great?  For I say unto you, that he that is faithful
in that which is least, is faithful also in much.” <span
id="fr_4374"></span>[4375](#fn_4374.md)   This, then, is what He means: 
“Keep the flesh holy and the seal undefiled, that <span
id="fr_4375"></span>[4376](#fn_4375.md) ye may receive eternal life.” <span
id="fr_4376"></span>[4377](#fn_4376.md)

the preceding words.
