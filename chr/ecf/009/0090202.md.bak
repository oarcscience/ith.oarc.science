<span id="xv.iii.i.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.vi-p1.1"></span>6.  The Fourfold Gospel.  John’s the First
Fruits of the Four.  Qualifications Necessary for Interpreting
It.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.vi-p2"></span>Now the Gospels are four.  These four
are, as it were, the elements of the faith of the Church, out of which
elements the whole world which is reconciled to God in Christ is put
together; as Paul says, <span id="fr_4476"></span>[4477](#fn_4476.md) “God
was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself;” of which world Jesus
bore the sin; for it is of the world of the Church that the word is
written, <span id="fr_4477"></span>[4478](#fn_4477.md) “Behold the Lamb of
God which taketh away the sin of the world.”  The Gospels then being
four, I deem the first fruits of the Gospels to be that which you <span
id="fr_4478"></span>[4479](#fn_4478.md) have enjoined me to search into
according to my powers, the Gospel of John, that which speaks of him
whose genealogy had already been set forth, but which begins to speak of
him at a point before he had any genealogy.  For Matthew, writing for
the Hebrews who looked for Him who was to come of the line of Abraham
and of David, says: <span id="fr_4479"></span>[4480](#fn_4479.md)   “The
book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of
Abraham.”  And Mark, knowing what he writes, narrates the beginning of
the Gospel; we may perhaps find what he aims at in John; in the
beginning the Word, God the Word.  But Luke, though he says at the
beginning of Acts, “The former treatise did I make about all that Jesus
began to do and to teach,” yet <span id="page_300">p. 300</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.vi-Page_300"></span>leaves to him who lay on Jesus’ breast
the greatest and completest discourses about Jesus.  For none of these
plainly declared His Godhead, as John does when he makes Him say, “I am
the light of the world,” “I am the way and the truth and the life,” “I
am the resurrection,” “I am the door,” “I am the good shepherd;” and in
the Apocalypse, “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the
end, the first and the last.”  We may therefore make bold to say that
the Gospels are the first fruits of all the Scriptures, but that of the
Gospels that of John is the first fruits.  No one can apprehend the
meaning of it except he have lain on Jesus’ breast and received from
Jesus Mary to be his mother also.  Such an one must he become who is to
be another John, and to have shown to him, like John, by Jesus Himself
Jesus as He is.  For if Mary, as those declare who with sound mind extol
her, had no other son but Jesus, and yet Jesus says to His mother,
“Woman, behold thy son,” <span id="fr_4480"></span>[4481](#fn_4480.md) and
not “Behold you have this son also,” then He virtually said to her, “Lo,
this is Jesus, whom thou didst bear.”  Is it not the case that every one
who is perfect lives himself no longer, <span
id="fr_4481"></span>[4482](#fn_4481.md) but Christ lives in him; and if
Christ lives in him, then it is said of him to Mary, “Behold thy son
Christ.”  What a mind, then, must we have to enable us to interpret in a
worthy manner this work, though it be committed to the earthly
treasure-house of common speech, of writing which any passer-by can
read, and which can be heard when read aloud by any one who lends to it
his bodily ears?  What shall we say of this work?  He who is accurately
to apprehend what it contains should be able to say with truth, <span
id="fr_4482"></span>[4483](#fn_4482.md) “We have the mind of Christ, that
we may know those things which are bestowed on us by God.”  It is
possible to quote one of Paul’s sayings in support of the contention
that the whole of the New Testament is Gospel.  He writes in a certain
place: <span id="fr_4483"></span>[4484](#fn_4483.md)   “According to my
Gospel.”  Now we have no written work of Paul which is commonly called a
Gospel.  But all that he preached and said was the Gospel; and what he
preached and said he was also in the habit of writing, and what he wrote
was therefore Gospel.  But if what Paul wrote was Gospel, it follows
that what Peter wrote was also Gospel, and in a word all that was said
or written to perpetuate the knowledge of Christ’s sojourn on earth, and
to prepare for His second coming, or to bring it about as a present
reality in those souls which were willing to receive the Word of God as
He stood at the door and knocked and sought to come into them.
