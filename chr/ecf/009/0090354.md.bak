<span id="xvi.ii.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>3.  The Shining of the Righteous.  Its
Interpretation.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.iii-p2"></span>But as we said above in reference to
the words, “Then shall the righteous shine as the sun,” that the
righteous will shine not differently as formerly, but as one sun, we
will, of necessity, set forth what appears to us on the point.  Daniel,
knowing that the intelligent are the light of the world, and that the
multitudes of the righteous differ in glory, seems to have said this,
“And the intelligent shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and
from among the multitudes of the righteous as the stars for ever and
ever.” <span id="fr_5172"></span>[5173](#fn_5172.md)   And in the passage,
“There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and
another glory of the stars:  for one star differeth from another star in
glory:  so also is the resurrection of the dead,” <span
id="fr_5173"></span>[5174](#fn_5173.md) the Apostle says the same thing as
Daniel, taking this thought from his prophecy.  Some one may inquire how
some speak about the difference of light among the righteous, while the
Saviour on the contrary says, “They shall shine as one sun.”  I think,
then, that at the beginning of the blessedness enjoyed by those who are
being saved (because those who are not such are not yet purified), the
difference connected with the light of the saved takes place:  but when,
as we have indicated, he gathers from the whole kingdom of Christ all
things that make men stumble, and the reasonings that work iniquity are
cast into the furnace of fire, and the worse elements utterly consumed,
and, when this takes place, those who received the words which are the
children of the evil one come to self-consciousness, then shall the
righteous having become one light of the sun shine in the kingdom of
their Father.  For whom will they shine?  For those below them who will
enjoy their light, after the analogy of the sun which now shines for
those upon the earth?  For, of course, they will not shine for
themselves.  But perhaps the saying, “Let your light shine before
men,” <span id="fr_5174"></span>[5175](#fn_5174.md) can be written “upon
the table of the heart,” <span id="fr_5175"></span>[5176](#fn_5175.md)
according to what is said by Solomon, in a threefold way; so that even
now the light of the disciples of Jesus shines before the rest of men,
and after death before the resurrection, and after the resurrection
“until all shall attain unto a full-grown man,” <span
id="fr_5176"></span>[5177](#fn_5176.md) and all become one sun.  Then shall
they shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.
