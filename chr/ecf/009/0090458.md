<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>17.  The Little Ones and Their
Stumbling-Blocks.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xvii-p2"></span>But it is a hard task to expound
what follows in logical harmony with what has already been said; for one
might say, how is it that he who is converted and has become as the
little children, is a little one among such as believe in Jesus, and is
capable <span id="page_485">p. 485</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xvii-Page_485"></span>of being caused to stumble?  And
likewise let us attempt to explain this coherently.  Every one that
gives his adherence to Jesus as the Son of God according to the true
history concerning Him, and by deeds done according to the Gospel, is on
the way to living the life which is according to virtue, is converted
and is on the way towards becoming as the little children; and it is
impossible for him not to enter into the kingdom of heaven.  There are,
indeed, many such; but not all, who are converted with a view to
becoming like the little children, have reached the point of being made
like unto little children; but each wants so much of the likeness to the
little children, as he falls short of the disposition of little children
towards the passions, of which we have spoken.  In the whole multitude,
then, of believers, are also those who, having been, as it were, just
converted in regard to their becoming as the little children, at the
very point of their conversion that they may become as the little
children, are called little; and those of them, who are converted that
they may become as the little children, but fall far short of having
truly become as the little children, are capable of being caused to
stumble; each of whom falls so far short of the likeness to them, as he
falls short of the disposition of children towards the passions, of
which we have spoken, to whom we ought not to give occasions of
stumbling-block; but, if it be otherwise, he who has caused him to
stumble will require, as contributing towards his cure, to have “an
ass’s millstone hanged about his neck, and be sunk into the depths of
the sea.” <span id="fr_5929"></span>[5930](#fn_5929.md)   For, in this way,
when he has paid the due penalty in the sea, where is “the dragon which
God formed to play in it,” <span id="fr_5930"></span>[5931](#fn_5930.md)
and, so far as is expedient for the end in view, has been punished and
undergone suffering, he shall then <span
id="fr_5931"></span>[5932](#fn_5931.md) have his part in those troubles
which belong to the depths of the sea, which he endured when he was
dragged down by the ass’s millstone.  For there are also differences of
millstones, so that one of them may be, so to call it, the millstone of
a man, and another that of an ass; and that is human, about which it is
written, “Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one
is left;” <span id="fr_5932"></span>[5933](#fn_5932.md) but the millstone
of the ass is that which shall be put round him who has given occasion
of stumbling-block.  But some one might say—I know not whether he would
speak soundly or erroneously—that the ass’s millstone is the heavy body
of the wicked man, which is sunken downwards, and which he will receive
at the resurrection that he may be sunk in the abyss which is called the
depth of the sea, where “is the dragon which God formed to play
therein.” <span id="fr_5933"></span>[5934](#fn_5933.md)   But another will
refer the creating of a stumbling-block to one of the little ones to the
powers that are unseen by men; for from these arise many
stumbling-blocks to the little ones pointed out by Jesus.  But when they
cause to stumble one of the little ones pointed out by Jesus, who are
believers in Him, he shall assume an ass’s millstone, the corruptible
body which presses heavily on the soul, which is itself hung from the
neck, which is dragged down to the affairs in this life, that by means
of these their conceit may be taken away, and having paid the penalty,
they shall come, through means of the ass’s millstone, to the condition
expedient for them.
