<span id="xii.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Many Evils Have Already Flowed
from This Source in Ancient Times.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.iv-p2"></span>For thus it is written:  “And it came to
pass after certain days, that Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a
sacrifice unto God; and Abel also brought of the firstlings of his
sheep, and of the fat thereof.  And God had respect to Abel and to his
offerings, but Cain and his sacrifices He did not regard.  And Cain was
deeply grieved, and his countenance fell.  And God said to Cain, Why art
thou grieved, and why is thy countenance fallen?  If thou offerest
rightly, but dost not divide rightly, hast thou not sinned?  Be at
peace:  thine offering returns to thyself, and thou shalt again possess
it.  And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into the field.  And
it came to pass, while they were in the field, that Cain rose up against
Abel his brother, and slew him.” <span
id="fr_4015"></span>[4016](#fn_4015.md)   Ye see, brethren, how envy and
jealousy led to the murder of a brother.  Through envy, also, our father
Jacob fled from the face of Esau his brother. <span
id="fr_4016"></span>[4017](#fn_4016.md)   Envy made Joseph be persecuted
unto death, and to come into bondage. <span
id="fr_4017"></span>[4018](#fn_4017.md)   Envy compelled Moses to flee from
the face of Pharaoh king of Egypt, when he heard these words from his
fellow-countryman, “Who made thee a judge or a ruler over us?  Wilt thou
kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian yesterday?” <span
id="fr_4018"></span>[4019](#fn_4018.md)   On account of envy, Aaron and
Miriam had to make their abode without the camp. <span
id="fr_4019"></span>[4020](#fn_4019.md)   Envy brought down Dathan and
Abiram alive to Hades, through the sedition which they excited against
God’s servant Moses. <span id="fr_4020"></span>[4021](#fn_4020.md)  
Through envy, David not only underwent the hatred of foreigners, but was
also persecuted by Saul king of Israel. <span

The writer here, as always, follows the reading of the Septuagint, which
in this passage both alters and adds to the Hebrew text.  We have given
the rendering approved by the best critics; but some prefer to
translate, as in our English version, “unto thee shall be his desire,
and thou shalt rule over him.”  See, for an ancient explanation of the
passage, Irenæus, *Adv. Hær*., iv. 18, 3.
