<span id="xiv.iii-p1"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xiv.iii-p1.1"></span>The Passion of the Scillitan Martyrs.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xiv.iii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii-p3.1"></span>When</span> Præsens, for the second time, and
Claudianus were the consuls, on the seventeenth day of July, at
Carthage, there were set in the judgment-hall Speratus, Nartzalus,
Cittinus, Donata, Secunda and Vestia.

<span id="xiv.iii-p4"></span>Saturninus the proconsul said:  Ye can win
the indulgence of our lord the Emperor, if ye return to a sound mind.

<span id="xiv.iii-p5"></span>Speratus said:  We have never done ill, we
have not lent ourselves to wrong, we have never spoken ill, but when
ill-treated we have given thanks; because we pay heed to <span
class="sc"><span id="xiv.iii-p5.1"></span>our Emperor</span>.

<span id="xiv.iii-p6"></span>Saturninus the proconsul said:  We too are
religious, and our religion is simple, and we swear by the genius of our
lord the Emperor, and pray for his welfare, as ye also ought to do.

<span id="xiv.iii-p7"></span>Speratus said:  If thou wilt peaceably lend
me thine ears, I can tell thee the mystery of simplicity.

<span id="xiv.iii-p8"></span>Saturninus said:  I will not lend mine ears
to thee, when thou beginnest to speak evil things of our sacred rites;
but rather swear thou by the genius of our lord the Emperor.

<span id="xiv.iii-p9"></span>Speratus said:  The empire of this world I
know not; but rather I serve that God, *whom no man hath seen, nor with
these eyes can see*. <span id="fr_4442"></span>[4443](#fn_4442)   I have
committed no theft; but if I have bought anything I pay the tax; because
I know my Lord, the King of kings and Emperor of all nations.

<span id="xiv.iii-p11"></span>Saturninus the proconsul said to the
rest:  Cease to be of this persuasion.

<span id="xiv.iii-p12"></span>Speratus said:  It is an ill persuasion to
do murder, to speak false witness.

<span id="xiv.iii-p13"></span>Saturninus the proconsul said:  Be not
partakers of this folly.

<span id="xiv.iii-p14"></span>Cittinus said:  We have none other to
fear, save only our Lord God, who is in heaven.

<span id="xiv.iii-p15"></span>Donata said:  Honour to Cæsar as Cæsar: 
but fear to God. <span id="fr_4443"></span>[4444](#fn_4443)

<span id="xiv.iii-p17"></span>Vestia said:  I am a Christian.

<span id="xiv.iii-p18"></span>Secunda said:  What I am, that I wish to
be.

<span id="xiv.iii-p19"></span>Saturninus the proconsul said to
Speratus:  Dost thou persist in being a Christian?

<span id="xiv.iii-p20"></span>Speratus said:  I am a Christian.  And
with him they all agreed.

<span id="xiv.iii-p21"></span>Saturninus the proconsul said:  Will ye
have a space to consider?

<span id="xiv.iii-p22"></span>Speratus said:  In a matter so
straightforward there is no considering.

<span id="xiv.iii-p23"></span>Saturninus the proconsul said:  What are
the things in your chest?

<span id="xiv.iii-p24"></span>Speratus said:  Books and epistles of
Paul, a just man.

<span id="xiv.iii-p25"></span>Saturninus the proconsul said:  Have a
delay of thirty days and bethink yourselves.

<span id="xiv.iii-p26"></span>Speratus said a second time:  I am a
Christian.  And with him they all agreed.

<span id="xiv.iii-p27"></span>Saturninus the proconsul read out the
decree from the tablet:  Speratus, Nartzalus, Cittinus, Donata, Vestia,
Secunda and the rest having confessed that they live according to the
Christian rite, since after opportunity offered them of returning to the
custom of the Romans they have obstinately persisted, it is determined
that they be put to the sword.

<span id="xiv.iii-p28"></span>Speratus said:  We give thanks to God.

<span id="xiv.iii-p29"></span>Nartzalus said:  To-day we are martyrs in
heaven; thanks be to God.

<span id="xiv.iii-p30"></span>Saturninus the proconsul ordered it to be
declared by the herald:  Speratus, Nartzalus, Cittinus, Veturius, Felix,
Aquilinus, Lætantius, Januaria, Generosa, Vestia, Donata and Secunda, I
have ordered to be executed.

<span id="xiv.iii-p31"></span>They all said:  Thanks be to God.

<span id="xiv.iii-p32"></span>And so they all together were crowned with
martyrdom; and they reign with the Father and the Son and the Holy
Ghost, for ever and ever.  Amen.
