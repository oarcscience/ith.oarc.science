to Angels.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxvii-p2"></span>Then again one might inquire at
what time those who are called their angels assume guardianship of the
little ones pointed out by Christ; whether they received this commission
to discharge concerning them, from what time “by the laver of
regeneration,” <span id="fr_5990"></span>[5991](#fn_5990.md) through which
they were born “as new-born babes, they long for the reasonable milk
which is without guile,” <span id="fr_5991"></span>[5992](#fn_5991.md) and
no longer are in subjection to any wicked power; or, whether from birth
they had been appointed, according to the foreknowledge and
predestination of God, over those whom God also foreknew, and
foreordained to be conformed to the glory of the Christ. <span
id="fr_5992"></span>[5993](#fn_5992.md)   And with reference to the view
that they have angels from birth, one might quote, “He who separated me
from my mother’s womb,” <span id="fr_5993"></span>[5994](#fn_5993.md) and,
“From the womb of my mother thou hast been my protector,” <span
id="fr_5994"></span>[5995](#fn_5994.md) and, “He has assisted me from my
mother’s womb,” <span id="fr_5995"></span>[5996](#fn_5995.md) and, “Upon
thee I was cast from my mother,” <span
id="fr_5996"></span>[5997](#fn_5996.md) and in the Epistle of Jude, “To
them that are beloved in God the Father and are kept for Jesus Christ,
being called,” <span id="fr_5997"></span>[5998](#fn_5997.md) —kept
completely by the angels who keep them.
