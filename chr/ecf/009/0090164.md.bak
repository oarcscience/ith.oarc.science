<span id="xii.vi.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Church, Formerly Barren, is
Now Fruitful.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.ii-p2"></span>“Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;
break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for she that is desolate
hath many more children than she that hath an husband.” <span
id="fr_4336"></span>[4337](#fn_4336.md)   In that He said, “Rejoice, thou
barren that bearest not,” He referred to us, for our church was barren
before that children were given to her.  But when He said, “Cry out,
thou that travailest not,” He means this, that we should sincerely offer
up our prayers to God, and should not, like women in travail, show signs
of weakness. <span id="fr_4337"></span>[4338](#fn_4337.md)   And in that He
said, “For she that is desolate hath many more children than she that
hath an husband,” \[He means\] that our people seemed to be outcast from
God, but now, through believing, have become more numerous than those
who are reckoned to possess God. <span
id="fr_4338"></span>[4339](#fn_4338.md)   And another Scripture saith, “I
came not to call the righteous, but sinners.” <span
id="fr_4339"></span>[4340](#fn_4339.md)   This means that those who are
perishing must be saved.  For it is indeed a great and admirable thing
to establish not the things which are standing, but those that are
falling.  Thus also did Christ <span
id="fr_4340"></span>[4341](#fn_4340.md) desire to save the things which
were perishing, <span id="fr_4341"></span>[4342](#fn_4341.md) and has saved
many by coming and calling us when hastening to destruction. <span
id="fr_4342"></span>[4343](#fn_4342.md)
