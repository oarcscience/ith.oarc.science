id="xv.iii.v.xxxi-p1.1"></span>31.  Of the Conversation Between John and
Jesus at the Baptism, Recorded by Matthew Only.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxxi-p2"></span>John the disciple does not tell us
where the Saviour comes from to John the Baptist, but we learn this from
Matthew, who writes: <span id="fr_4951"></span>[4952](#fn_4951.md)   “Then
cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John, to be baptized of him.” 
And Mark adds the place in Galilee; he says, <span
id="fr_4952"></span>[4953](#fn_4952.md) “And it came to pass in those days,
that Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in
Jordan.”  Luke does not mention the place Jesus came from, but on the
other hand he tells us what we do not learn from the others, that
immediately after the baptism, as He was coming up, heaven was opened to
Him, and the Holy Spirit descended on Him in bodily form like a dove. 
Again, it is Matthew alone who tells us of John’s preventing the Lord,
saying to the Saviour, “I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest
Thou to me?”  None of the others added this after Matthew, so that they
might not be saying just the same as he.  And what the Lord rejoined,
“Suffer it now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness,”
this also Matthew alone recorded.
