<span id="xii.iv.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.—Let the Members of the
Church Submit Themselves, and No One Exalt Himself Above Another.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xxxviii-p2"></span>Let our whole body, then, be
preserved in Christ Jesus; <span id="fr_4203"></span>[4204](#fn_4203)
and let every one be subject to his neighbour, according to the special
gift <span id="fr_4204"></span>[4205](#fn_4204) bestowed upon him.  Let
the strong not despise <span id="fr_4205"></span>[4206](#fn_4205) the
weak, and let the weak show respect unto the strong.  Let the rich man
provide for the wants of the poor; and let the poor man bless God,
because He hath given him one by whom his need may be supplied.  Let the
wise man display his wisdom, not by \[mere\] words, but through good
deeds.  Let the humble not bear testimony to himself, but leave witness
to be borne to him by another. <span
id="fr_4206"></span>[4207](#fn_4206)   Let him that is pure in the flesh
not grow proud <span id="fr_4207"></span>[4208](#fn_4207) of it, and
boast, knowing that it was another who bestowed on him the gift of
continence.  Let us consider, then, brethren, of what matter we were
made,—who and what manner of beings we came into the world, as it were
out of a sepulchre, and from utter darkness. <span
id="fr_4208"></span>[4209](#fn_4208)   He who made us and fashioned us,
having prepared His bountiful gifts for us before we were born,
introduced us into His world.  Since, therefore, we receive all these
things from Him, we ought for everything to give Him thanks; to whom be
glory for ever and ever.  Amen.
