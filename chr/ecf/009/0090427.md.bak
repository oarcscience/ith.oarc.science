<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxx-Page_466"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxx-p1.1"></span>30.  The Word Appears in Different Forms;
The Time of His Coming in Glory.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxx-p2"></span>But if you will understand the
differences of the Word which by “the foolishness of preaching” <span
id="fr_5743"></span>[5744](#fn_5743.md) is proclaimed to those who believe,
and spoken in wisdom to them that are perfect, you will see in what way
the Word has the form of a slave to those who are learning the
rudiments, so that they say, “We saw Him and He had no form or
beauty.” <span id="fr_5744"></span>[5745](#fn_5744.md)   But to the perfect
He comes “in the glory of His own Father,” <span
id="fr_5745"></span>[5746](#fn_5745.md) who might say, “and we beheld His
glory, the glory as of the only-begotten from the Father, full of grace
and truth.” <span id="fr_5746"></span>[5747](#fn_5746.md)   For indeed to
the perfect appears the glory of the Word, and the only-begotten of God
His Father, and the fulness of grace and likewise of truth, which that
man cannot perceive who requires the “foolishness of the preaching,” in
order to believe.  But “the Son of man shall come in the glory of His
own Father” not alone, but “with His own angels.”  And if you can
conceive of all those who are fellow-helpers in the glory of the Word,
and in the revelation of the Wisdom which is Christ, coming along with
Him, you will see in what way the Son of man comes in the glory of His
own Father with His own angels.  And consider whether you can in this
connection say that the prophets who formerly suffered in virtue of
their word having “no form or beauty” had an analogous position to the
Word who had “no form or beauty.”  And, as the Son of man comes in the
glory of His own Father, so the angels, who are the words in the
prophets, are present with Him preserving the measure of their own
glory.  But when the Word comes in such form with His own angels, He
will give to each a part of His own glory and of the brightness of His
own angels, according to the action of each.  But we say these things
not rejecting even the second coming of the Son of God understood in its
simpler form.  But when shall these things happen?  Shall it be when
that apostolic oracle is fulfilled which says, “For we must all stand
before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things
done in the body, according to what he has done, whether it be good or
bad?” <span id="fr_5747"></span>[5748](#fn_5747.md)   But if He will render
to each according to his deed, not the good deed only, nor the evil
apart from the good, it is manifest that He will render to each
according to every evil, and according to every good, deed.  But I
suppose—in this also following the Apostle, but comparing also the
sayings of Ezekiel, in which the sins of him who is a perfect convert
are wiped out, and the former uprightness of him who has utterly fallen
away is not held of account—that in the case of him who is perfected,
and has altogether laid aside wickedness, the sins are wiped out, but
that, in the case of him who has altogether revolted from piety, if
anything good was formerly done by him, it is not taken into
account. <span id="fr_5748"></span>[5749](#fn_5748.md)   But to us, who
occupy a middle position between the perfect man and the apostate, when
we stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, <span
id="fr_5749"></span>[5750](#fn_5749.md) there is rendered what we have
done, whether good or bad; for we have not been so pure that our evil
deeds are not at all imputed unto us, nor have we fallen away to such an
extent that our better actions are forgotten.
