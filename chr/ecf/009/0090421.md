<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>24.  Self-Denial and
Cross-Bearing.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxiv-p2"></span>“*Then Jesus said to His disciples,
If any man wills to follow after Me,*” etc. <span
id="fr_5716"></span>[5717](#fn_5716.md)   He shows by these words that, to
will to come after Jesus and to follow Him, springs from no <span
id="page_464">p. 464</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxiv-Page_464"></span>ordinary manly courage, and that no
one who has not denied himself can come after Jesus.  And the man denies
himself who wipes out by a striking revolution his own former life which
had been spent in wickedness; as by way of illustration he who was once
licentious denies his licentious self, having become self-controlled
even abidingly.  But it is probable that some one may put the objection,
whether as he denied himself so he also confesses himself, when he
denied himself, the unjust, and confesses himself, the righteous one. 
But, if Christ is righteousness, he who has received righteousness
confesses not himself but Christ; so also he who has found wisdom, by
the very possession of wisdom, confesses Christ.  And such a one indeed
as, “with the heart believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth
maketh confession unto salvation,” <span
id="fr_5717"></span>[5718](#fn_5717.md) and bears testimony to the works of
Christ, as making confession by all these things of Christ before men,
will be confessed by Him before His Father in heaven. <span
id="fr_5718"></span>[5719](#fn_5718.md)   So also he who has not denied
himself but denied the Christ will experience the saying, “I also will
deny him.” <span id="fr_5719"></span>[5720](#fn_5719.md)   On this account
let every thought and every purpose and every word and every action
become a denial of ourselves, but a testimony about Christ and in
Christ; for I am persuaded that every action of the perfect man is a
testimony to Christ Jesus, and that abstinence from every sin is a
denial of self, leading him after Christ.  And such an one is crucified
with Christ, and taking up his own cross follows Him who for our sakes
bears His own cross, according to that which is said in John:  “They
took Jesus therefore and put it on Him,” etc., down to the words, “Where
they crucified Him.” <span id="fr_5720"></span>[5721](#fn_5720.md)   But
the Jesus according to John, so to speak, bears the cross for Himself,
and bearing it went out; but the Jesus according to Matthew and Mark and
Luke, does not bear it for Himself, for Simon of Cyrene bears it. <span
id="fr_5721"></span>[5722](#fn_5721.md)   And perhaps this man refers to
us, who because of Jesus take up the cross of Jesus, but Jesus Himself
takes it upon Himself; for there are, as it were, two conceptions of the
cross, the one which Simon of Cyrene bears, and the other which Jesus
Himself bears for Himself.
