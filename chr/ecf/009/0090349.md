<span id="xvi.ii.i-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.ii.i-p3.1"></span>Concerning</span> the four Gospels which alone
are uncontroverted in the Church of God under heaven, I have learned by
tradition that the Gospel according to Matthew, who was at one time a
publican and afterwards an Apostle of Jesus Christ, was written first;
and that he composed it in the Hebrew tongue and published it for the
converts from Judaism.  The second written was that according to Mark,
who wrote it according to the instruction of Peter, who, in his General
Epistle, acknowledged him as a son, saying, “The church that is in
Babylon, elect together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Mark my
son.” <span id="fr_5150"></span>[5151](#fn_5150)   And third, was that
according to Luke, the Gospel commended by <span
id="fr_5151"></span>[5152](#fn_5151) Paul, which he composed for the
converts from the Gentiles.  Last of all, that according to John.
