id="xii.iv.i-p9.1"></span>The</span> church of God which sojourns at
Rome, to the church of God sojourning at Corinth, to them that are
called and sanctified by the will of God, through our Lord Jesus
Christ:  Grace unto you, and peace, from Almighty God through Jesus
Christ, be multiplied.

<span id="xii.iv.i-p10"></span>Owing, dear brethren, to the sudden and
successive calamitous events <span id="fr_3998"></span>[3999](#fn_3998)
which have happened to ourselves, we feel that we have been somewhat
tardy in turning our attention to the points respecting which you
consulted us; and especially to that shameful and detestable sedition,
utterly abhorrent to the elect of God, which a few rash and
self-confident persons have kindled to such a pitch of frenzy, that your
venerable and illustrious name, worthy to be universally loved, has
suffered grievous injury. <span id="fr_3999"></span>[4000](#fn_3999)  
For who ever dwelt even for a short time among you, and did not find
your faith to be as fruitful of virtue as it was firmly
established? <span id="fr_4000"></span>[4001](#fn_4000)   Who did not
admire the sobriety and moderation of your godliness in Christ?  Who did
not proclaim the magnificence of your habitual hospitality?  And who did
not rejoice over your perfect and well-grounded knowledge?  For ye did
all things without respect of persons, and walked in the commandments of
God, being obedient to those who had the rule over you, and giving all
fitting honour to the presbyters among you.  Ye enjoined young men to be
of a sober and serious mind, ye instructed your wives to do all things
with a blameless, becoming, and pure conscience, loving their husbands
as in duty bound; and ye taught them that, living in the rule of
obedience, they should manage their household affairs becomingly, and be
in every respect marked by discretion.

to the Corinthians.”
