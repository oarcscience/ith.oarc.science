<span id="xii.iv.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—But Let Us Not Give Up
the Practice of Good Works and Love.  God Himself is an Example to Us of
Good Works.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xxxiii-p2"></span>What shall we do, <span
id="fr_4160"></span>[4161](#fn_4160.md) then, brethren?  Shall we become
slothful in well-doing, and cease from the practice of love?  God forbid
that any such course should be followed by us!  But rather let us hasten
with all energy and readiness of mind to perform every good work.  For
the Creator and Lord of all Himself rejoices in His works.  For by His
infinitely great power He established the heavens, and by His
incomprehensible wisdom He adorned them.  He also divided the earth from
the water which surrounds it, and fixed it upon <span id="page_239">p.
239</span> <span id="xii.iv.xxxiii-Page_239"></span>the immovable
foundation of His own will.  The animals also which are upon it He
commanded by His own word <span id="fr_4161"></span>[4162](#fn_4161.md)
into existence.  So likewise, when He had formed <span
id="fr_4162"></span>[4163](#fn_4162.md) the sea, and the living creatures
which are in it, He enclosed them \[within their proper bounds\] by His
own power.  Above all, <span id="fr_4163"></span>[4164](#fn_4163.md) with
His holy and undefiled hands He formed man, the most excellent \[of His
creatures\], and truly great through the understanding given him—the
express likeness of His own image.  For thus says God:  “Let us make man
in our image, and after our likeness.  So God made man; male and female
He created them.” <span id="fr_4164"></span>[4165](#fn_4164.md)   Having
thus finished all these things, He approved them, and blessed them, and
said, “Increase and multiply.” <span
id="fr_4165"></span>[4166](#fn_4165.md)   We see, <span
id="fr_4166"></span>[4167](#fn_4166.md) then, how all righteous men have
been adorned with good works, and how the Lord Himself, adorning Himself
with His works, rejoiced.  Having therefore such an example, let us
without delay accede to His will, and let us work the work of
righteousness with our whole strength.
