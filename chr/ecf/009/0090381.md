<span id="xvi.ii.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>4.  The Multitudes and the Disciples
Contrasted.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.iv-p2"></span>“*And straightway He constrained the
disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before Him unto the other
side, till He should send the multitudes away.*” <span
id="fr_5364"></span>[5365](#fn_5364)   It should be observed how often
in the same passages is mentioned the word, “the multitudes,” and
another word, “the disciples,” so that by observing and bringing
together the passages about this matter it may be seen that the aim of
the Evangelists was to represent by means of the Gospel history the
differences of those who come to Jesus; of whom some are the multitudes
and are not called disciples, and others are the disciples who are
better than the multitudes.  It is sufficient, however, for the present,
for us to set forth a few sayings, so that any one who is moved by them
may do the like with the whole of the Gospels.  It is written then—as if
the multitudes were below, but the disciples were able to come to Jesus
when He went up into the mountain, where the multitudes were not able to
be—as follows:  “And seeing the multitudes He went up into the mountain,
and when He had sat down His disciples came unto Him; and He opened His
mouth and taught them saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit,”
etc. <span id="fr_5365"></span>[5366](#fn_5365)   And again in another
place, as the multitudes stood in need of healing, it is said, “Many
multitudes followed Him and He healed them.” <span
id="fr_5366"></span>[5367](#fn_5366)   We do not find any healing
recorded of the disciples; since if any one is already a disciple of
Jesus he is whole, and being well he needs Jesus not as a physician but
in respect of His other powers.  Again in another place, when He was
speaking to the multitudes, His mother and His brethren stood without,
seeking to speak to Him; this was made known to Him by some one to whom
He answered, stretching forth His hand not towards the multitudes but
towards the disciples, and said, “Behold My mother and My
brethren,” <span id="fr_5367"></span>[5368](#fn_5367) and bearing
testimony to the disciples as doing the will of the Father which is in
heaven, He added, “He is My brother and sister and mother.” <span
id="fr_5368"></span>[5369](#fn_5368)   And again in another place it is
written, “All the multitude stood on the beach and He spake to them many
things in parables.” <span id="fr_5369"></span>[5370](#fn_5369)   Then
after the parable of the sowing, it was no longer the multitudes but the
disciples who came and said to Him, not “Why speakest thou to us in
parables,” but, “Why speakest thou to them in parables.” <span
id="fr_5370"></span>[5371](#fn_5370)   Then also He answered and said,
not to the multitudes but to the disciples, “To you it is given to know
the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to the rest in
parables.” <span id="fr_5371"></span>[5372](#fn_5371) <span
id="page_434">p. 434</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iv.iv-Page_434"></span>Accordingly, of those who come to the
name of Jesus some, who know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,
would be called disciples; but those to whom such a privilege is not
given would be called multitudes, who would be spoken of as inferior to
the disciples.  For observe carefully that He said to the disciples, “To
you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,” but
about the multitudes, “To them it is not given.” <span
id="fr_5372"></span>[5373](#fn_5372)   And in another place He dismisses
the multitudes indeed, and goes into the house, <span
id="fr_5373"></span>[5374](#fn_5373) but He does not dismiss the
disciples; and there came to Him into His house, not the multitudes but
His disciples, saying, “Declare to us the parable of the tares of the
field.” <span id="fr_5374"></span>[5375](#fn_5374)   Moreover, also, in
another place when Jesus heard the things concerning John and withdrew
in a boat to a desert place apart, the multitudes followed Him; when He
came forth and saw a great multitude He had compassion on them and
healed their sick—the sick of the multitudes, not of the
disciples. <span id="fr_5375"></span>[5376](#fn_5375)   “And when even
was come there came to Him,” not the multitudes, but the disciples, as
being different from the multitudes, saying, “Send the multitudes away
that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.” <span
id="fr_5376"></span>[5377](#fn_5376)   And, further, when Jesus took the
five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven He blessed and
brake the loaves, He gave not to the multitudes but to the
disciples, <span id="fr_5377"></span>[5378](#fn_5377) that the disciples
might give to the multitudes who were not able to take from Him, but
received with difficulty at the hands of the disciples the loaves of the
blessing of Jesus, and did not eat even all these; for the multitudes
were filled and left that which remained over in twelve baskets which
were full.
