<span id="xv.iii.i.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxiii-p1.1"></span>23.  The Title “Word” Is to Be
Interpreted by the Same Method as the Other Titles of Christ.  The Word
of God is Not a Mere Attribute of God, But a Separate Person.  What is
Meant When He is Called the Word.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxiii-p2"></span>Let us consider, however, a little
more carefully what is the Word which is in the beginning.  I am often
led to wonder when I consider the things that are said about Christ,
even by those who are in earnest in their belief in Him.  Though there
is a countless number of names which can be applied to our Saviour, they
omit the most of them, and if they should remember them, they declare
that these titles are not to be understood in their proper sense, but
tropically.  But when they come to the title Logos (Word), and repeat
that Christ alone is the Word of God, they are not consistent, and do
not, as in the case of the other titles, search out what is behind the
meaning of the term “Word.”  I wonder at the stupidity of the general
run of Christians in this matter.  I do not mince matters; it is nothing
but stupidity.  The Son of God says in one passage, “I am the light of
the world,” and in another, “I am the resurrection,” and again, “I am
the way and the truth and the life.”  It is also written, “I am the
door,” and we have the saying, “I am the good shepherd,” and when the
woman of Samaria says, “We know the <span id="page_309">p. 309</span>
<span id="xv.iii.i.xxiii-Page_309"></span>Messiah is coming, who is
called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things,” Jesus
answers, “I that speak unto thee am He.”  Again, when He washed the
disciples’ feet, He declared Himself in these words <span
id="fr_4552"></span>[4553](#fn_4552.md) to be their Master and Lord:  “You
call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.”  He also
distinctly announces Himself as the Son of God, when He says, <span
id="fr_4553"></span>[4554](#fn_4553.md) “He whom the Father sanctified and
sent unto the world, to Him do you say, Thou blasphemest, because I
said, I am the Son of God?” and <span
id="fr_4554"></span>[4555](#fn_4554.md) “Father, the hour is come; glorify
Thy Son, that the Son also may glorify Thee.”  We also find Him
declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers Pilate’s
question, <span id="fr_4555"></span>[4556](#fn_4555.md) “Art Thou the King
of the Jews?” by saying, “My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom
were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be
delivered to the Jews, but now is My kingdom not from hence.”  We have
also read the words, <span id="fr_4556"></span>[4557](#fn_4556.md) “I am
the true vine and My Father is the husbandman,” and again, “I am the
vine, ye are the branches.”  Add to these testimonies also the
saying, <span id="fr_4557"></span>[4558](#fn_4557.md) “I am the bread of
life, that came down from heaven and giveth life to the world.”  These
texts will suffice for the present, which we have picked up out of the
storehouse of the Gospels, and in all of which He claims to be the Son
of God.  But in the Apocalypse of John, too, He says, <span
id="fr_4558"></span>[4559](#fn_4558.md) “I am the first and the last, and
the living One, and I was dead.  Behold, I am alive for evermore.”  And
again, <span id="fr_4559"></span>[4560](#fn_4559.md) “I am the <span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.iii.i.xxiii-p10.2"></span>Α</span> and the
<span class="Greek"><span id="xv.iii.i.xxiii-p10.3"></span>Ω</span>, and
the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”  The careful student
of the sacred books, moreover, may gather not a few similar passages
from the prophets, as where He calls Himself <span
id="fr_4560"></span>[4561](#fn_4560.md) a chosen shaft, and a servant of
God, <span id="fr_4561"></span>[4562](#fn_4561.md) and a light of the
Gentiles. <span id="fr_4562"></span>[4563](#fn_4562.md)   Isaiah also
says, <span id="fr_4563"></span>[4564](#fn_4563.md) “From my mother’s womb
hath He called me by my name, and He made my mouth as a sharp sword, and
under the shadow of His hand did He hide me, and He said to me, Thou art
My servant, O Israel, and in thee will I be glorified.”  And a little
farther on:  “And my God shall be my strength, and He said to me, This
is a great thing for thee to be called My servant, to set up the tribes
of Jacob and to turn again the diaspora of Israel.  Behold I have set
thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation
to the end of the earth.”  And in Jeremiah too <span
id="fr_4564"></span>[4565](#fn_4564.md) He likens Himself to a lamb, as
thus:  “I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.”  These and
other similar sayings He applies to Himself.  In addition to these one
might collect in the Gospels and the Apostles and in the prophets a
countless number of titles which are applied to the Son of God, as the
writers of the Gospels set forth their own views of what He is, or the
Apostles extol Him out of what they had learned, or the prophets
proclaim in advance His coming advent and announce the things concerning
Him under various names.  Thus John calls Him the Lamb of God,
saying, <span id="fr_4565"></span>[4566](#fn_4565.md) “Behold the Lamb of
God which taketh away the sins of the world,” and in these words he
declares Him as a man, <span id="fr_4566"></span>[4567](#fn_4566.md) “This
is He about whom I said, that there cometh after me a man who is there
before me; for He was before me.”  And in his Catholic Epistle John says
that He is a Paraclete for our souls with the Father, as thus: <span
id="fr_4567"></span>[4568](#fn_4567.md)   “And if any one sin, we have a
Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,” and he adds that
He is a propitiation for our sins, and similarly Paul says He is a
propitiation: <span id="fr_4568"></span>[4569](#fn_4568.md)   “Whom God set
forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, on account of
forgiveness of the forepast sins, in the forbearance of God.”  According
to Paul, too, He is declared to be the wisdom and the power of God, as
in the Epistle to the Corinthians: <span
id="fr_4569"></span>[4570](#fn_4569.md)   “Christ the power of God and the
wisdom of God.”  It is added that He is also sanctification and
redemption:  “He was made to us of God,” he says, “wisdom and
righteousness and sanctification and redemption.”  But he also teaches
us, writing to the Hebrews, that Christ is a High-Priest: <span
id="fr_4570"></span>[4571](#fn_4570.md)   “Having, therefore, a great
High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God,
let us hold fast our profession.”  And the prophets have other names for
Him besides these.  Jacob in his blessing of his sons <span
id="fr_4571"></span>[4572](#fn_4571.md) says, “Judah, thy brethren shall
extol thee; thy hands are on the necks of thine enemies.  A lion’s whelp
is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art thou sprung up; thou hast lain down
and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him?”  We cannot now linger over
these phrases, to show that what is said of Judah applies to Christ. 
What may be quoted against this view, viz., “A ruler shall not part from
Judah nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is
reserved;” this can better be cleared up on another occa<span
id="page_310">p. 310</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.xxiii-Page_310"></span>sion.  But Isaiah knows Christ to be
spoken of under the names of Jacob and Israel, when he says, <span
id="fr_4572"></span>[4573](#fn_4572.md) “Jacob is my servant, I will help
Him; Israel is my elect, my soul hath accepted Him.  He shall declare
judgment to the Gentiles.  He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall
any one hear His voice on the streets.  A bruised rod shall He not
break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth
judgment from victory, and in His name shall the nations hope.”  That it
is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his
Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says: <span
id="fr_4573"></span>[4574](#fn_4573.md)   “That the saying might be
fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry,” etc.  David also is called
Christ, as where Ezekiel in his prophecy to the shepherds adds as from
the mouth of God: <span id="fr_4574"></span>[4575](#fn_4574.md)   “I will
raise up David my servant, who shall be their shepherd.”  For it is not
the patriarch David who is to rise and be the shepherd of the saints,
but Christ.  Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower: <span
id="fr_4575"></span>[4576](#fn_4575.md)   “There shall come forth a rod out
of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of this root, and
the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and
understanding, the spirit of counsel and of might, the spirit of
knowledge and of godliness, and He shall be full of the spirit of the
fear of the Lord.”  And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as
follows: <span id="fr_4576"></span>[4577](#fn_4576.md)   “The stone which
the builders rejected is made the head of the corner.  It is from the
Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.”  And the Gospel shows, as also
does Luke in the Acts, that the stone is no other than Christ; the
Gospel as follows: <span id="fr_4577"></span>[4578](#fn_4577.md)   “Have ye
never read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of
the corner.  Whosoever falls on this stone shall be broken, but on
whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.”  And Luke writes
in Acts: <span id="fr_4578"></span>[4579](#fn_4578.md)   “This is the
stone, which was set at naught of you the builders, which has become the
head of the corner.”  And one of the names applied to the Saviour is
that which He Himself does not utter, but which John records;—the Word
who was in the beginning with God, God the Word.  And it is worth our
while to fix our attention for a moment on those scholars who omit
consideration of most of the great names we have mentioned and regard
this as the most important one.  As to the former titles, they look for
any account of them that any one may offer, but in the case of this one
they proceed differently and ask, What is the Son of God when called the
Word?  The passage they employ most is that in the Psalms, <span
id="fr_4579"></span>[4580](#fn_4579.md) “My heart hath produced a good
Word;” and they imagine the Son of God to be the utterance of the Father
deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly they do not allow
Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis, nor are
they clear about His essence.  I do not mean that they confuse its
qualities, but the fact of His having an essence of His own.  For no one
can understand how that which is said to be “Word” can be a Son.  And
such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from the Father, and
accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is a
Son, let them say that God the Word is a separate being and has an
essence of His own.  We insist, therefore, that as in the case of each
of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to the concept it
suggests and apply it and demonstrate how the Son of God is suitably
described by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him
called the Word.  What caprice it is, in all these cases, not to stand
upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense Christ is to be
understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the
way; but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a
different course.  To add to the authority, therefore, of what we have
to say on the question, how the Son of God is the Word, we must begin
with those names of which we spoke first as being applied to Him.  This,
we cannot deny, will seem to some to be superfluous and a digression,
but the thoughtful reader will not think it useless to ask as to the
concepts for which the titles are used; to observe these matters will
clear the way for what is coming.  And once we have entered upon the
theology concerning the Saviour, as we seek with what diligence we can
and find the various things that are taught about Him, we shall
necessarily understand more about Him not only in His character as the
Word, but in His other characters also.
