<span id="xii.iv.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV.—It is the Part of the Wicked to
Vex the Righteous.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xlv-p2"></span>Ye are fond of contention, brethren, and
full of zeal about things which do not pertain to salvation.  Look
carefully into the Scriptures, which are the true utterances of the Holy
Spirit.  Observe <span id="fr_4236"></span>[4237](#fn_4236.md) that nothing
of an unjust or counterfeit character is written in them.  There <span
id="fr_4237"></span>[4238](#fn_4237.md) you will not find that the
righteous were cast off by men who themselves were holy.  The righteous
were indeed persecuted, but only by the wicked.  They were cast into
prison, but only by the unholy; they were stoned, but only by
transgressors; they were slain, but only by the accursed, and such as
had conceived an unrighteous envy against them.  Exposed to such
sufferings, they endured them gloriously.  For what shall we say,
brethren?  Was Daniel <span id="fr_4238"></span>[4239](#fn_4238.md) cast
into the den of lions by such as <span id="page_243">p. 243</span> <span
id="xii.iv.xlv-Page_243"></span>feared God?  Were Ananias, and Azarias,
and Michael shut up in a furnace <span
id="fr_4239"></span>[4240](#fn_4239.md) of fire by those who observed <span
id="fr_4240"></span>[4241](#fn_4240.md) the great and glorious worship of
the Most High?  Far from us be such a thought!  Who, then, were they
that did such things?  The hateful, and those full of all wickedness,
were roused to such a pitch of fury, that they inflicted torture on
those who served God with a holy and blameless purpose \[of heart\], not
knowing that the Most High is the Defender and Protector of all such as
with a pure conscience venerate <span
id="fr_4241"></span>[4242](#fn_4241.md) His all-excellent name; to whom be
glory for ever and ever.  Amen.  But they who with confidence endured
\[these things\] are now heirs of glory and honour, and have been
exalted and made illustrious <span id="fr_4242"></span>[4243](#fn_4242.md)
by God in their memorial for ever and ever.  Amen.
