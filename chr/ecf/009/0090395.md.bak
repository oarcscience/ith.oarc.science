<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>18.  Concerning the Multitudes Who Were
Healed.  Comparison of the Mountain Where Jesus Sat to the
Church.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xviii-p2"></span>“*And Jesus departed
thence,*”—manifestly, from what has been said before, from the parts of
Tyre and Sidon,—“*and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee,*” <span
id="fr_5525"></span>[5526](#fn_5525.md) which is commonly called the Lake
of Gennesaret, and again went up into the mountain where He went up and
sat.  We may say, then, that into this mountain where Jesus sits, not
only the sound in health go up, but along with the sound, those also who
were suffering from various disorders.  And, perhaps, this mountain to
which Jesus went up and sat is that which is more commonly called the
Church, which has been set up through the word of God over the rest of
the world and the men upon it; whither go not the disciples only,
leaving the multitudes as in the case of the beatitudes, but great
multitudes who were not accused themselves of being deaf or suffering
from any affection, but who had such along with themselves.  For you may
see, along with the multitudes who come to this mountain where the Son
of God sits, some who have become deaf to the things promised, and
others blind in soul and not looking at the true light, and others who
are lame and not able to walk according to reason, and others who are
maimed and not able to work according to reason.  Those, accordingly,
who are suffering in soul from such things, though they go up along with
the multitudes into the mountain where Jesus was, so long as they are
outside of the feet of Jesus, are not healed by Him; but when, as men
suffering from such disorders, they are cast by the multitude at His
feet, <span id="fr_5526"></span>[5527](#fn_5526.md) and at the extremities
of the body of Christ, not being worthy to obtain such things so far as
they themselves are concerned, they are then healed by Him.  And when
you see in the congregation of what is more commonly called the church
the catechumens cast behind those who are at the extreme end of it, and
as it were at the feet of the body of Jesus—the church—coming to it with
their own deafness and blindness and lameness and crookedness, and in
time cured according to the Word, you would not err in saying that such
having gone up with the multitudes of the church to the mountain where
Jesus was, are cast at His feet and are healed; so that the multitude of
the church is astonished at beholding transformations which have taken
place from so great evils to that which is better, so that it might say,
those who were formerly dumb afterwards speak the word of God, and the
lame walk, the prophecy of Isaiah being fulfilled, not only in things
bodily but in things spiritual, which said, “Then shall the lame man
leap as an hart, and the tongue of him that hath an impediment in his
speech be plain.” <span id="fr_5527"></span>[5528](#fn_5527.md)   And
there, unless the expression, “the lame man shall leap as an hart,” is
to be taken as accidental, we will say that those formerly lame, <span
id="page_448">p. 448</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iv.xviii-Page_448"></span>and who now through the power of
Jesus leap as an hart are not without design compared to a hart, which
is a clean animal, and hostile to serpents and cannot at all be injured
by their poison.  But also, in respect of the fact that the dumb are
seen speaking is the prophecy fulfilled which said, “And the tongue of
him that hath an impediment shall be plain,” or rather that which said,
“Hear ye deaf;” but the blind see according to the prophecy following,
“Hear ye deaf, and ye blind look up that ye may see.” <span
id="fr_5528"></span>[5529](#fn_5528.md)   Now the blind see, when they see
the world and from the exceeding great beauty of the things created they
contemplate the Creator corresponding in greatness and beauty to them;
and when they see clearly “the invisible things of God Himself from the
creation of the world, which are perceived through the things that are
made;” <span id="fr_5529"></span>[5530](#fn_5529.md) that is, they see and
understand with care and clearness.  Now the multitudes seeing these
things, glorified the God of Israel, <span
id="fr_5530"></span>[5531](#fn_5530.md) and glorify Him in the persuasion
that it is the same God, who is the Father of Him who healed those
previously mentioned, and the God of Israel.  For He is not the God of
the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles. <span
id="fr_5531"></span>[5532](#fn_5531.md)   Let us then cause to go up along
with ourselves to the mountain where Jesus sits—His church—those who
wish to go up to it along with us, the deaf, the blind, the lame, the
maimed and many others, and let us cast them at the feet of Jesus that
He may heal them, so that the multitudes are astonished at their
healing; for it is not the disciples who are described as wondering at
such things, although at that time they were present with Jesus, as is
manifest from the words, “And Jesus called unto Him His disciples and
said, I have compassion on the multitudes,” <span
id="fr_5532"></span>[5533](#fn_5532.md) etc.; and perhaps if you attend
carefully to the words, “There came unto Him great multitudes,” <span
id="fr_5533"></span>[5534](#fn_5533.md) you would find that the disciples
at that time did not come to Him, but had begun long ago to follow Him
and followed Him into the mountain.  But there came unto Him those who
were inferior to the disciples, and were then for the first time
approaching Him, who had not the same experience as those who had gone
up with them.  Observe, moreover, in the Gospel who are described as
having followed Jesus, and who as having come to Him, and who as having
been brought to Him, and the division between those who go before and of
those who follow; and of those who came, who came to Him in the house,
and who when He was elsewhere.  For by observation, and by comparing
things spiritual with spiritual, you would find many things worthy of
the accurate wisdom in the Gospels.
