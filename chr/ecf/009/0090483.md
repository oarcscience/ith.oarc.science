<span id="xvi.ii.vii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.x-p1.1"></span>10.  The Man Who Owed Many Talents.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.x-p2"></span>Next we must speak in regard to this,
“*And when he had begun to reckon, there was brought unto him one which
owed many talents.*” <span id="fr_6103"></span>[6104](#fn_6103)   The
sense of this appears to me to be as follows:  The season of beginning
the judgment is with the house of God, who says, as also it is written
in Ezekiel, to those who are appointed to attend to punishments, “Begin
ye with My saints;” <span id="fr_6104"></span>[6105](#fn_6104) and it is
like “the twinkling of an eye;” but, the time of making a reckoning
includes the same “twinkling,” ideally apprehended, for we are not
forgetful of what has been previously said of those who owe more. 
Wherefore it is not written, when he was making reckoning, but it is
said, “When he began to reckon,” there was brought, at the beginning of
his making a reckoning, one who owed many talents; he had lost tens of
thousands of talents, having been entrusted with great things, and
having had many things committed to his care, but he had brought no gain
to his master, but had lost tens of thousands so that he owed many
talents; and, perhaps on this account, he owed many talents, seeing that
he followed often the woman, who was sitting upon the talent of lead,
whose name is wickedness. <span id="fr_6105"></span>[6106](#fn_6105)  
But observe here that every great sin is a loss of the talents of the
master of the house, and such sins are committed by fornicators,
adulterers, abusers of themselves with men, effeminate, idolaters,
murderers.  Perhaps then the one who is brought to the king owing many
talents has committed no small sin but all that are great and heinous;
and if you were to seek for him among men, perhaps you would find him to
be “the man of sin, the son of perdition, he that opposeth and exalteth
himself against every God or object of worship;” <span
id="fr_6106"></span>[6107](#fn_6106) but if you seek him outside the
number of men, who can this be but the devil who has ruined so many who
received him, who wrought sin in them.  For “man is a great thing, and a
pitiful man is precious,” <span id="fr_6107"></span>[6108](#fn_6107)
precious so as to be worthy of a talent, whether of gold like as the
lamp which was equal to <span id="page_501">p. 501</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vii.x-Page_501"></span>a talent of gold, <span
id="fr_6108"></span>[6109](#fn_6108) or of silver or of any kind of
material whatsoever understood intellectually, the symbols of which are
recorded in the Words of the Days, <span
id="fr_6109"></span>[6110](#fn_6109) when David became enriched with
many talents of which the number is mentioned, so many talents of gold,
and so many of silver, and of the rest of the material there named, from
which the temple of God was built.
