<span id="xvi.ii.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>8.  Concerning the Pharisees and Scribes
Who Came and Inquired, Why Do Thy Disciples Transgress the Tradition of
the Elders?</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.viii-p2"></span>“*Then there came to Him from
Jerusalem* <span id="page_437">p. 437</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iv.viii-Page_437"></span>*Pharisees and scribes, saying, Why
do Thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?  For they wash
not their hands when they eat bread.*” <span
id="fr_5402"></span>[5403](#fn_5402.md)   He who observes at what time the
Pharisees and scribes came from Jerusalem to Jesus, saying, “Why do Thy
disciples transgress the tradition of the elders,” etc., will perceive
that Matthew of necessity wrote not simply that Pharisees and scribes
from Jerusalem came to the Saviour to inquire of Him the matters before
us, but put it thus, “Then come to Him from Jerusalem.”  What time,
therefore, are we to understand by “then”?  At the time when Jesus and
His disciples crossed over and came in the boat to the land of
Gennesaret, when the wind ceased from the time that Jesus entered into
the boat, and when “the men of that place knowing Him sent into all that
region round about, and brought unto Him all that were sick, and
besought Him that they might touch if it were only the border of His
garment, and as many as touched were made whole.” <span
id="fr_5403"></span>[5404](#fn_5403.md)   At that time came to Him from
Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, not struck with admiration at the power
which was in Jesus, which healed those who only touched even the border
of His garment, but in a censorious spirit, accusing the disciples
before their Teacher, not concerning the transgression of a commandment
of God, but of a single tradition of the Jewish elders.  And it is
probable that this very charge of these censorious persons is a proof of
the piety of the disciples of Jesus, who gave to the Pharisees and
scribes no opportunity of censure with reference to the transgression of
the commandments of God, as they would not have brought the charge of
transgression against the disciples, as transgressing the commandment of
the elders, if they had had it in their power to censure those whom they
accused, and to show that they were transgressing a commandment of God. 
But do not suppose that these things go to establish the necessity of
keeping the law of Moses according to the letter, because the disciples
of Jesus up to that time kept it; for not before He suffered did He
“redeem us from the curse of the law,” <span
id="fr_5404"></span>[5405](#fn_5404.md) who in suffering for men “became a
curse for us.”  But just as fittingly Paul became a Jew to the Jews that
he might gain Jews, <span id="fr_5405"></span>[5406](#fn_5405.md) what
strange thing is it that the Apostles, whose way of life was passed
among the Jews, even though they understood the spiritual things in the
law, should have used a spirit of accommodation, as Paul also did when
he circumcised Timothy, <span id="fr_5406"></span>[5407](#fn_5406.md) and
offered sacrifice in accordance with a certain legal vow, as is written
in the Acts of the Apostles? <span id="fr_5407"></span>[5408](#fn_5407.md)
  Only, again, they appear fond of bringing accusations, as they have no
charge to bring against the disciples of Jesus with reference to a
commandment of God, but only with reference to one tradition of the
elders.  And especially does this love of accusation become manifest in
this, that they bring the charge in presence of those very persons who
had been healed from their sickness; in appearance against the
disciples, but in reality purposing to slander their Teacher, as it was
a tradition of the elders that the washing of hands was a thing
essential to piety.  For they thought that the hands of those who did
not wash before eating bread were defiled and unclean, but that the
hands of those who had washed them with water became pure and holy, not
in a figurative sense, in due relation to the law of Moses according to
the letter.  But let us, not according to the tradition of the elders
among the Jews, but according to sound reason, endeavour to purify our
own actions and so to wash the hands of our souls, when we are about to
eat the three loaves which we ask from Jesus, who wishes to be our
friend; <span id="fr_5408"></span>[5409](#fn_5408.md) for with hands that
are defiled and unwashed and impure, we ought not to partake of the
loaves.
