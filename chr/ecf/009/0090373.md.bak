<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>22.  The Dancing of Herodias.  The
Keeping of Oaths.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xxii-p2"></span>Wherefore John, endued with
prophetic boldness and not terrified at the royal dignity of Herod, nor
through fear of death keeping silence in regard to so flagrant a sin,
filled with a divine spirit said to Herod, “It is not lawful for thee to
have her; for it is not lawful for thee to have the wife of thy
brother.”  For Herod having laid hold on John bound him and put him in
prison, not daring to slay him outright and to take away the prophetic
word from the people; but the wife of the king of Trachonitis—which is a
kind of evil opinion and wicked teaching—gave birth to a daughter of the
same name, whose movements, seemingly harmonious, pleasing Herod, who
was fond of matters connected with birthdays, came the cause of there
being no longer a prophetic head among the people.  And up to this point
I think that the movements of the people of the Jews, which seem to be
according to the law, were nothing else than the movements of the
daughter of Herodias; but the dancing of Herodias was opposed to that
holy dancing with which those who have not danced will be reproached
when they hear the words, “We piped unto you, and ye did not
dance.” <span id="fr_5316"></span>[5317](#fn_5316.md)   And on birthdays,
when the lawless word reigns over them, they dance so that their
movements please that word.  Some one of those before us has observed
what is written in Genesis about the birthday of Pharaoh, and has told
<span id="page_429">p. 429</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xxii-Page_429"></span>that the worthless man who loves
things connected with birth keeps birthday festivals; and we, taking
this suggestion from him, find in no Scripture that a birthday was kept
by a righteous man.  For Herod was more unjust than that famous Pharaoh;
for by the latter on his birthday feast a chief baker is killed; <span
id="fr_5317"></span>[5318](#fn_5317.md) but by the former, John, “than whom
no one greater hath risen among those born of women,” <span
id="fr_5318"></span>[5319](#fn_5318.md) in regard to whom the Saviour says,
“But for what purpose did ye go out?  To see a prophet?  Yea, I say unto
you, and more than a prophet.” <span
id="fr_5319"></span>[5320](#fn_5319.md)   But thanks be unto God, that,
even if the grace of prophecy was taken from the people, a grace greater
than all that was poured forth among the Gentiles by our Saviour Jesus
Christ, who became “free among the dead;” <span
id="fr_5320"></span>[5321](#fn_5320.md) for “though He were crucified
through weakness, yet He liveth through the power of God.” <span
id="fr_5321"></span>[5322](#fn_5321.md)   Consider also the word in which
pure and impure meats are inquired into; but prophecy is despised when
it is brought forward in a charger instead of meat.  But the Jews have
not the head of prophecy, inasmuch as they disown the crown of all
prophecy, Christ Jesus; and the prophet is beheaded, because of an oath
in a case where the duty was rather to break the oath than to keep the
oath; for the charge of rashness in taking an oath and of breaking it
because of the rashness is not the same in guilt as the death of a
prophet.  And not on this account alone is he beheaded, but because “of
those who sat at meat with him,” who preferred that the prophet should
be killed rather than live.  And they recline at the same table and also
feast along with the evil word which reigns over the Jews, who make
merry over his birth.  At times you may make a graceful application of
the passage to those who swear rashly and wish to hold fast oaths which
are taken with a view to unlawful deeds, by saying that not every
keeping of oaths is seemly, just as the keeping of the oath of Herod was
not.  And mark, further, that not openly but secretly and in prison does
Herod put John to death.  For even the present word of the Jews does not
openly deny the prophecies, but virtually and in secret denies them, and
is convicted of disbelieving them.  For as “if they believed Moses they
would have believed Jesus,” <span id="fr_5322"></span>[5323](#fn_5322.md)
so if they had believed the prophets they would have received Him who
had been the subject of prophecy.  But disbelieving Him they also
disbelieve them, and cut off and confine in prison the prophetic word,
and hold it dead and divided, and in no way wholesome, since they do not
understand it.  But we have the whole Jesus, the prophecy concerning Him
being fulfilled which said, “A bone shall not be broken.” <span
