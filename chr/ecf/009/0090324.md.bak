<span id="xv.iii.vi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>9.  Heracleon Says that Jesus is Not
Stated to Have Done Anything at Capernaum.  But in the Other Gospels He
Does Many Things There.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.ix-p2"></span>But Heracleon, dealing with the words,
“After this He went down to Capernaum,” declares that they indicate the
introduction of another transaction, and that the word “went down” is
not without significance.  “Capernaum,” he says, “means these
farthest-out parts of the world, these districts of matter, into which
He descended, and because the place was not suitable, he says, He is not
reported either to have done anything or said anything in it.”  Now if
the Lord had not been reported in the other Gospels either as having
done or said anything at Capernaum, we might perhaps have hesitated
whether this view ought or ought not to be received.  But that is far
from being the case.  Matthew says our Lord left Nazareth and came and
dwelt at Capernaum on the seaside, and that from that time He began to
preach, saying, “Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”  And
Mark, starting in his narrative <span
id="fr_5014"></span>[5015](#fn_5014.md) from the temptation by the devil,
relates that after John was cast into prison, Jesus came into Galilee,
proclaiming the Gospel of God, and after the call of the four fishermen
to the Apostleship, “they enter into Capernaum; and straightway on the
Sabbath day He taught in the synagogue, and they were astonished at His
doctrine.”  And Mark records an action of Jesus also which took place at
Capernaum, for he goes on to say, “In their synagogue there was a man
with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, saying, Ah! what have we to do
with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth?  Art Thou come to destroy us?  We
know Thee who Thou art, the Son of God.  And Jesus rebuked him, saying,
Hold thy peace and come out of him; and the unclean spirit, tearing him
and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.  And they were all
amazed.”  And at Capernaum Simon’s mother-in-law is cured of her fever. 
And Mark adds that when evening was come all those were cured who were
sick and who were possessed with demons.  Luke’s report is very like
Mark’s about Capernaum. <span id="fr_5015"></span>[5016](#fn_5015.md)   He
says, “And He came to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching
them on the Sabbath day, and they were astonished at His teachings, for
His word was with power.  And in the synagogue there was a man having a
spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, Ah! what
have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth?  Hast Thou come to
destroy us?  I know Thee who Thou art, the holy one of God.  And Jesus
rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him.  Then the demon
having thrown him down in the midst, went out of him, doing him no
harm.”  And then Luke reports how the Lord rose up from the synagogue
and went into the house of Simon, and rebuked the fever in his
mother-in-law, and cured her of her disease; and after this cure, “when
the sun was setting,” he says, “all, as many as had persons sick with
divers diseases, brought them to Him, and He laid his hands on each one
of them and cured them.  And demons also went out from many, crying and
saying, Thou art the Son of God, and He rebuked them and suffered them
not to speak because they knew that He was the Christ.”  We have
presented all these statements as to the Saviour’s sayings and doings at
Capernaum in order to refute Heracleon’s interpretation of our <span
id="page_387">p. 387</span> <span
id="xv.iii.vi.ix-Page_387"></span>passage, “Hence He is not said to have
done or to have spoken anything there.”  He must either give two
meanings to Capernaum, and show us his reasons for them, or if he cannot
do this he must give up saying that the Saviour visited any place to no
purpose.  We, for our part, should we come to passages where even a
comparison of the other Gospels fails to show that Jesus’ visit to this
place or that was not accompanied by any results, will seek with the
divine assistance to make it clear that His coming was not in vain.
