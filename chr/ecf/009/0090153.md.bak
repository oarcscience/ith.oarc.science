id="xii.iv.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVIII.—Submission the Precursor of
Salvation.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.lviii-p2"></span>Let us, therefore, flee from the
warning threats pronounced by Wisdom on the disobedient, and yield
submission to His all-holy and glorious name, that we may stay our trust
upon the most hallowed name of His majesty.  Receive our counsel, and ye
shall be without repentance.  For, as God liveth, and as the Lord Jesus
Christ and the Holy Ghost live,—both the faith and hope of the elect, he
who in lowliness of mind, with instant gentleness, and without
repentance hath observed the ordinances and appointments given by
God—the same shall obtain a place and name in the number of those who
are being saved through Jesus Christ, through whom is glory to Him for
ever and ever.  Amen.
