Higher Life, that of Reason.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xix-p2"></span>As for those who make up a mythology
about the æons and arrange them in syzygies (yokes or pairs), and who
consider the Logos and Life to have been emitted by Intellect and Truth,
it may not be beside the point to state the following difficulties.  How
can life, in their system, the yokefellow of the Word, derive his origin
from his yokefellow?  For “what was made in Him,” he says, evidently
referring to the Word, mentioned immediately before, “was life.”  Will
they tell us how life, the yokefellow, as they say, of the Word, came
into being in the Word, and how life rather than the Word is the light
of men.  It would be quite natural if men of reasonable minds, who are
perplexed with such questions and find the point we have raised hard to
dispose of, should turn round upon us and invite us to discuss the
reason why it is not the Word that is said to be the light of men, but
life which originated in the Word.  To such an enquiry we shall reply
that the life here spoken of is not that which is common to rational
beings and to beings without reason, but that life which is added to us
upon the completion of reason in us, our share in that life, being
derived from the first reason (Logos).  It is when we turn away from the
life which is life in appearance only, not in truth, and when we yearn
to be filled with the true life, that we are made partakers of it, and
when it has arisen in us it becomes the foundation of the light of the
higher knowledge (gnosis).  With some it may be that this life is only
potentially and not actually light, with those who do not strive to
search out the things of the higher knowledge, while with others it is
actually light.  With these it clearly is so who act on Paul’s
injunction, “Seek earnestly the best gifts;” and among the greatest
gifts is that which all are enjoined to seek, namely, the word of
wisdom, and it is followed by the word of knowledge.  This wisdom and
this knowledge lie side by side; into the difference between them this
is not a fitting occasion to enquire.
