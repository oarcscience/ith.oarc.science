id="xv.iii.i.ix-p1.1"></span>9.  The Somatic and the Spiritual
Gospel.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.ix-p2"></span>We must not, however, forget that the
sojourning of Christ with men took place before His bodily sojourn, in
an intellectual fashion, to those who were more perfect and not
children, and were not under pedagogues and governors.  In their minds
they saw the fulness of the time to be at hand—the patriarchs, and Moses
the servant, and the prophets who beheld the glory of Christ.  And as
before His manifest and bodily coming He came to those who were perfect,
so also, after His coming has been announced to all, to those who are
still children, since they are under pedagogues and governors and have
not yet arrived at the fulness of the time, forerunners of Christ have
come to sojourn, discourses (*logoi*) suited for minds still in their
childhood, and rightly, therefore, termed pedagogues.  But the Son
Himself, the glorified God, the Word, has not yet come; He waits for the
preparation which must take place on the part of men of God who are to
admit His deity.  And this, too, we must bear in mind, that as the law
contains a shadow of good things to come, which are indicated by that
law which is announced according to truth, so the Gospel also teaches a
shadow of the mysteries of Christ, the Gospel which is thought to be
capable of being understood by any one.  What John calls the eternal
Gospel, and what may properly be called the spiritual Gospel, presents
clearly to those who have the will to understand, all matters concerning
the very Son of God, both the mysteries presented by His discourses and
those matters of which His acts were the enigmas.  In accordance with
this we may conclude that, as it is with Him who is a Jew outwardly and
circumcised in the flesh, so it is with the Christian and with baptism. 
Paul and Peter were, at an earlier period, Jews outwardly and
circumcised, but later they received from Christ that they should be so
<span id="page_302">p. 302</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.ix-Page_302"></span>in secret, too; so that outwardly they
were Jews for the sake of the salvation of many, and by an economy they
not only confessed in words that they were Jews, but showed it by their
actions.  And the same is to be said about their Christianity.  As Paul
could not benefit those who were Jews according to the flesh, without,
when reason shows it to be necessary, circumcising Timothy, and when it
appears the natural course getting himself shaved and making a vow, and,
in a word, being to the Jews a Jew that he might gain the Jews—so also
it is not possible for one who is responsible for the good of many to
operate as he should by means of that Christianity only which is in
secret.  That will never enable him to improve those who are following
the external Christianity, or to lead them on to better and higher
things.  We must, therefore, be Christians both somatically and
spiritually, and where there is a call for the somatic (bodily) Gospel,
in which a man says to those who are carnal that he knows nothing but
Jesus Christ and Him crucified, so we must do.  But should we find those
who are perfected in the spirit, and bear fruit in it, and are enamoured
of the heavenly wisdom, these must be made to partake of that Word
which, after it was made flesh, rose again to what it was in the
beginning, with God.
