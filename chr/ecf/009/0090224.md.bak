<span id="xv.iii.i.xxviii-p2"></span>It is clear also that the principle
of that life which is pure and unmixed with any other element, resides
in Him who is the first-born of all creation, taking from which those
who have a share in Christ live the life which is true life, while all
those who are thought to live apart from this, as they have not the true
light, have not the true life either.
