<span id="xv.iii.ii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.xx-p1.1"></span>20.  Different Kinds of Light; And of
Darkness.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xx-p2"></span>“And <span
id="fr_4726"></span>[4727](#fn_4726.md) the light shineth in darkness and
the darkness hath not overtaken it.”  We are still enquiring about the
light of men, since it is what was spoken of in the preceding verse, and
also, I consider, about darkness, which is named as its adversary, the
darkness also being, if the definition of it is correct, that of men. 
The light of men is a generic notion covering two special things; and
with the darkness of men it is the same.  He who has gained the light of
men and shares its beams will do the work of light and know in the
higher sense, being illuminated by the light of the higher knowledge. 
And we must recognize the analogous case of those on the other side, and
of their evil actions, and of that which is thought to be but is not
really knowledge, since those who exercise it have the reason (Logos)
not of light but of darkness.  And because the sacred word knows the
things which produce light, Isaiah says: <span
id="fr_4727"></span>[4728](#fn_4727.md)   “Because Thy commandments are a
light upon the earth,” and David says in the Psalm, <span
id="fr_4728"></span>[4729](#fn_4728.md) “The precept of the Lord is clear,
enlightening the eyes.”  But since in addition to the commandments and
the precepts there is a light of higher knowledge, we read in one of the
twelve (prophets), <span id="fr_4729"></span>[4730](#fn_4729.md) “Sow to
yourselves for righteousness, reap to yourselves for the fruit of life,
make light for yourselves the light of knowledge.”  There is a further
light of knowledge in addition to the commandments, and so we read,
“Make light for yourselves,” not simply light, but what light?—the light
of knowledge.  For if any light that a man kindles for himself were a
<span id="page_338">p. 338</span> <span
id="xv.iii.ii.xx-Page_338"></span>light of knowledge, then the added
words, “Make light for yourselves, the light of knowledge,” would have
no meaning.  And again that darkness is brought upon men by their evil
deeds, we learn from John himself, when he says in his epistle, <span
id="fr_4730"></span>[4731](#fn_4730.md) “If we say that we have fellowship
with Him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth,” and again,
“He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in
darkness even until now,” and again, “He that hateth his brother is in
darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth,
because darkness hath blinded his eyes.”  Walking in darkness signifies
evil conduct, and to hate one’s brother, is not that to fall away from
that which is properly called knowledge?  But he also who is ignorant of
divine things walks in darkness, just because of that ignorance; as
David says, <span id="fr_4731"></span>[4732](#fn_4731.md) “They knew not,
they understood not, they walk in darkness.”  Consider, however, this
passage, <span id="fr_4732"></span>[4733](#fn_4732.md) “God is light and in
Him is no <span id="fr_4733"></span>[4734](#fn_4733.md) darkness,” and see
if the reason for this saying is not that darkness is not one, being
either two, because there are two kinds of it, or many, because it is
taken distributively, individually with reference to the many evil
actions and the many false doctrines; so that there are many darknesses,
not one of which is in God.  The saying of the Saviour could not be
spoken of the Holy One, “Ye are the light of the world;” for the Holy
One is light of the world (absolute, not particular), and there is not
in Him any darkness.
