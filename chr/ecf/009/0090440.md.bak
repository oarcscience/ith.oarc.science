<span id="xvi.ii.v.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xliii-p1.1"></span>43.  Relation of Moses and Elijah to
Jesus.  The Injunction of Silence.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xliii-p2"></span>But after these things it is written
that, when they heard the voice from the cloud bearing testimony to the
Son, the three Apostles, not being able to bear the glory of the voice
and power resting upon it, “fell on their face,” <span
id="fr_5815"></span>[5816](#fn_5815.md) and besought God; for they were
sore afraid at the supernatural sight, and the things which were spoken
from the sight.  But consider if you can also say this with reference to
the details in the passage, that the disciples, having understood that
the Son of God had been holding conference with Moses, and that it was
He who said, “A man shall not see My face and live,” <span
id="fr_5816"></span>[5817](#fn_5816.md) and taking further the testimony of
God about Him, as not being able to endure the radiance of the Word,
humbled themselves under the mighty hand of God; <span
id="fr_5817"></span>[5818](#fn_5817.md) but, after the touch of the Word,
lifting up their eyes they saw Jesus only and no other. <span
id="fr_5818"></span>[5819](#fn_5818.md)   Moses, the law, and Elijah, the
prophet, became one only with the Gospel of Jesus; and not, as they were
formerly three, did they so abide, but the three became one.  But
consider these things with me in relation to mystical matters; for in
regard to the bare meaning of the letter, Moses and Elijah, having
appeared in glory and talked with Jesus, went away to the place from
which they had come, perhaps to communicate the words which Jesus spake
with them, to those who were to be benefited by Him, almost immediately,
namely, at the time of the passion, when many bodies of the saints that
had fallen asleep, their tombs being opened, were to go to the city
which is truly holy—not the Jerusalem which Jesus wept over—and there
appear unto many. <span id="fr_5819"></span>[5820](#fn_5819.md)   But after
the dispensation in the mountain, when the disciples were coming down
from the mountain in order that, when they had come to the multitude,
they might serve the Son of God concerning the salvation of the people,
Jesus commanded the disciples saying, “Tell the vision to no man until
the Son of man rise from the dead.” <span
id="fr_5820"></span>[5821](#fn_5820.md)   But that saying, “Tell the vision
to no man,” is like that which was investigated in the passage above,
when “He enjoined the disciples to tell no man that He was the
Christ.” <span id="fr_5821"></span>[5822](#fn_5821.md)   Wherefore the
things that were said at that passage may be useful to us also for the
passage before us; since Jesus wishes also, in accordance with these,
that the things of His glory should not be spoken of, before His glory
after the passion; for those who heard, and in particular the
multitudes, would have been injured when they saw Him crucified, who had
been so glorified.  Wherefore since His being glorified in the
resurrection was akin to His transfiguration, and to the vision of His
face as the sun, on this account He wishes that these things should then
be spoken of by the Apostles, when He rose from the dead.
