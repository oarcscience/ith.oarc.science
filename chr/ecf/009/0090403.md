<span id="xvi.ii.v.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.vi-p1.1"></span>6.  The Meaning of Leaven.  Jesus’
Knowledge of the Heart.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.vi-p2"></span>Then expounding clearly and
representing to them, who were being distracted because of the equivocal
meaning of loaf and leaven, in an undisguised fashion, that He was not
speaking to them about sensible bread but about the leaven in the
teaching, He subjoins, “*How is it that ye do not perceive that I spake
not you concerning bread?  But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and
the Sadducees.*” <span id="fr_5593"></span>[5594](#fn_5593)   And though
He had not laid bare the interpretation, but still continued to use
metaphorical language, the disciples would have understood that the
discourse of the Saviour was about the teaching, figuratively called
leaven, which the Pharisees and Sadducees were teaching.  So long, then,
as we have Jesus with us fulfilling the promise which runs, “Lo, I am
with you always unto the consummation of the age,” <span
id="fr_5594"></span>[5595](#fn_5594) we cannot fast nor be in want of
food, so that, because of want of it we should desire to take and eat
the forbidden leaven, even from the Pharisees and Sadducees.  Now there
may sometimes be a time, when He is with us, that we are without food,
as is spoken of in the passage above, “They continue with me now three
days and have nothing to eat;” <span
id="fr_5595"></span>[5596](#fn_5595) but, even though this should
happen, being unwilling to send us away fasting lest we faint on the
way, He gives thanks over the loaves which were with the disciples, and
causes us to have the seven baskets over from the seven loaves, as we
have recorded.  And moreover this also is to be observed, in view of
those who think that the divinity of the Saviour is not at all
demonstrable from the Gospel of Matthew, that the fact that, when the
disciples were reasoning among themselves <span id="page_454">p.
454</span> <span id="xvi.ii.v.vi-Page_454"></span>and saying, “We have
no loaves,” Jesus knew their reasonings and said, “Why reason ye among
yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye took no loaves,” <span
id="fr_5596"></span>[5597](#fn_5596) was beyond the power of man; for
the Lord alone, as Solomon says in the third Book of Kings, knows the
hearts of men. <span id="fr_5597"></span>[5598](#fn_5597)   But since
the disciples understood, when Jesus said, “Beware of the leaven,” <span
id="fr_5598"></span>[5599](#fn_5598) that He did not tell them to beware
of the loaves but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees, you
will understand that whenever leaven is named it is put figuratively for
teaching, whether in the law, or in the Scriptures which come after the
law; and so perhaps leaven is not offered upon the altar; for it is not
right that prayers should take the form of teaching, but should only be
supplications of good things from God.  But one might inquire, on
account of what has been said about disciples who came to the other
side, if any one who has reached the other side can be reproached as one
of little faith, and as not yet understanding nor remembering what was
done by Jesus.  But it is not difficult, I think, to say to this, that
in relation to that which is perfect, on the coming of which “that which
is in part shall be done away,” <span
id="fr_5599"></span>[5600](#fn_5599) all our faith here is little faith,
and in regard to that, we who know in part do not yet know nor remember;
for we are not able to obtain a memory which is sufficient and able to
attain to the magnitude of the nature of the speculations.
