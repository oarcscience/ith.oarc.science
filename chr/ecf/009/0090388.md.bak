<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>11.  Exposition of the Prophecy of Isaiah
Quoted by Jesus.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xi-p2"></span>And, after this, wishing to refute
completely from the words of the prophets all these traditions of the
elders among the Jews, He brought before them a saying, from Isaiah,
which in the exact words is as follows:  “And the Lord said, This people
draws nigh to Me with their mouth,” etc.; <span
id="fr_5425"></span>[5426](#fn_5425.md) and, as we said before, Matthew has
not written out the prophetical saying in the very words.  And, if it be
necessary because of its use in the Gospel to interpret it according to
our ability, we will take in addition the preceding passage which is, in
my judgment, noted with advantage by us for the exposition of that
passage in the Gospel which was taken from the prophet.  The passage in
Isaiah from the beginning is thus, “Be ye faint, and be maddened:  be ye
drunken, but not with strong drink nor with wine:  for the Lord hath
given you to drink of the spirit of stupor, and He will close their
eyes, both of their prophets, and of their rulers who see things
secret.  And all these sayings shall be to you as the words of the book,
which has been sealed, which if they give to a man who knows letters,
saying, Read this, he shall answer, I cannot read, for it is sealed. 
And this book will be given into the hands of a man who does not know
letters, and one will say to him, Read this, and he will say, I know not
letters.  And the Lord said, This people is nigh to Me,” etc., down to
the words, “Woe unto them that form counsel in secret, and their works
shall be in darkness.” <span id="fr_5426"></span>[5427](#fn_5426.md)  
Taking up then the passage before us in the Gospel, I have put some of
the verses which come before it, and some which follow it, in order to
show in what way the Word threatens to close the eyes of those of the
people who are astonished and drunken, and have been made to drink of
the spirit of deep sleep.  And it threatens also to close the eyes of
their prophets and their rulers who profess to see things secret,—which
things, I think, took place after the advent of the Saviour among that
people; for all the words of the whole of the Scriptures, <span
id="page_440">p. 440</span> <span id="xvi.ii.iv.xi-Page_440"></span>and
of Isaiah also, have become to them as the words of a sealed book.  Now
the expression “sealed” is used of a book closed in virtue of its
obscurity and not open in virtue of its lucidity, which is equally
obscure to those who are not able to read it at all because they do not
know letters, and to those who profess to know letters but do not
understand the meaning in the things which have been written.  Well,
then, does he add to this, that when the people, fainting because of
their sins and being in a state of madness rage against Him through
those sins wherewith they shall be drunken against Him with the spirit
of stupor, which shall be given to them to drink by the Lord when He
closes their eyes, as unworthy to see, and the eyes of their prophets
and of their rulers who profess to see the hidden things of the
mysteries in the Divine Scriptures; and, when their eyes are closed,
then shall the prophetic words be sealed to them and hidden, as has been
the case with those who do not believe in Jesus as the Christ.  And when
the prophetic sayings have become as the words of a sealed book, not
only to those who do not know letters but to those who profess to know,
then the Lord said, that the people of the Jews draw nigh to God with
their mouth only, and He says that they honour Him with their lips,
because their heart by reason of their unbelief in Jesus is far from the
Lord.  And now, especially, from the time at which they denied our
Saviour, it might be said about them by God, “But in vain do they
worship Me;” <span id="fr_5427"></span>[5428](#fn_5427.md) for they no
longer teach the precepts of God but of men, and doctrines which are
human and no longer of the Spirit of wisdom.  Wherefore, when these
things happen to them, God has removed the people of the Jews, and has
caused to perish the wisdom of the wise men among them; for there is no
longer wisdom among them, just as there is no prophecy; but God has
utterly destroyed the prudence of the prudent and concealed it, <span
id="fr_5428"></span>[5429](#fn_5428.md) and no longer is it splendid and
conspicuous.  Wherefore, although they may seem to form some counsel in
a deep fashion, because they do it not through the Lord they are called
miserable; and even though they profess to tell some secrets of the
Divine counsel they lie, since their works are not works of light, but
of darkness and night. <span id="fr_5429"></span>[5430](#fn_5429.md)   I
have thought it right briefly to set forth the prophecy, and to a
certain extent elucidate its meaning, seeing that Matthew made mention
of it.  And Mark also made mention of it, from whom we may usefully set
down the following words in the place, with reference to the
transgression of the elders who held that it was necessary to wash hands
when the Jews ate bread, “For the Pharisees and all the Jews, except
they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the
elders; and when they come from the market-place except they wash
themselves they eat not.  And there are some other things which they
have received to hold, washings of cups and pots and brazen vessels and
couches.” <span id="fr_5430"></span>[5431](#fn_5430.md)
