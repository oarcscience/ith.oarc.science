<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxviii-p1.1"></span>28.  The Exchange for One’s
Life.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxviii-p2"></span>But the saying, “*What shall a man
give in exchange for his own life,*” <span
id="fr_5730"></span>[5731](#fn_5730.md) if spoken by way of interrogation,
will seem to be able to indicate that an exchange for his own life is
given by the man who after his sins has given up his whole substance,
that his property may feed the poor, as if he were going by that to
obtain salvation; but, if spoken affirmatively, I think, to indicate
that there is not anything in man by the giving of which in exchange for
his own life which has been overcome by death, he will ransom it out of
its hand.  A man, therefore, could not give anything as an exchange for
his own life, but God gave an exchange for the life of us all, “the
precious blood of Christ Jesus,” <span
id="fr_5731"></span>[5732](#fn_5731.md) according as “we were bought with a
price,” <span id="fr_5732"></span>[5733](#fn_5732.md) “having been
redeemed, not with corruptible things as silver or gold, but with
precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,” even of
Christ. <span id="fr_5733"></span>[5734](#fn_5733.md)   And in Isaiah it is
said to Israel, “I gave Ethiopia in exchange for thee, and Egypt and
Syene for thee; from what time thou hast become honourable before Me
thou wast glorified.” <span id="fr_5734"></span>[5735](#fn_5734.md)   For
the exchange, for example, of the first-born of Israel was the
first-born of the Egyptians, and the exchange for Israel was the
Egyptians who died in the last plagues that came upon Egypt, and in the
drowning which took place after the plagues.  But, from these things,
let him who is able inquire whether the exchange of the true Israel
given by God, “who redeems Israel from all his transgressions,” <span
id="fr_5735"></span>[5736](#fn_5735.md) is the true Ethiopia, and, so to
speak, spiritual Egypt, and Syene of Egypt; and to inquire with more
boldness, perhaps Syene is the exchange for Jerusalem, and Egypt for
Judæa, and Ethiopia for those who fear, who are different from Israel,
and the house of Levi, and the house of Aaron.
