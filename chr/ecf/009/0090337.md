<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.xxii-p1.1"></span>22.  The Temple of Solomon Did Not Take
Forty-Six Years to Build.  With Regard to that of Ezra We Cannot Tell
How Long It Took.  Significance of the Number Forty-Six.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxii-p2"></span>The Jews therefore said, “Forty and
six years was this temple in building, <span
id="fr_5105"></span>[5106](#fn_5105) and wilt thou raise it up in three
days?”  How the Jews said that the temple had been forty-six years
building, we cannot tell, if we adhere to the history.  For it is
written in the third Book of Kings, <span
id="fr_5106"></span>[5107](#fn_5106) that they prepared the stones and
the wood three years, and in the fourth year, in the second month, <span
id="fr_5107"></span>[5108](#fn_5107) when Solomon was king over Israel,
the king commanded, and they brought great precious stones for the
foundation of the house, and unhewn stones.  And the sons of Solomon and
the sons of Hiram hewed the stones and laid them in the fourth year, and
they founded the house of the Lord in the month Nisan and the second
month:  in the tenth <span id="page_403">p. 403</span> <span
id="xv.iii.vi.xxii-Page_403"></span>year in the month Baal, which was
the eighth month, the house was finished according to the whole count
and the whole plan of it.  Thus comparing the time of its completion
with the period of building, the building of it occupies less than
eleven years.  How, then, do the Jews come to say that the temple was
forty-six years in building?  One might, indeed, do violence to the
words and make out the period of forty-six years at all costs, by
counting from the time when David, after planning about the building of
the temple, said to Nathan the prophet, <span
id="fr_5108"></span>[5109](#fn_5108) “Behold I dwell in a house of
cedar, and the ark of God dwelleth in the midst of the tent,” for though
it is true that he was prevented, as being a man of blood, <span
id="fr_5109"></span>[5110](#fn_5109) from carrying out the building, he
seems to have busied himself in collecting materials for it.  In the
first Book of Chronicles, <span id="fr_5110"></span>[5111](#fn_5110)
certainly, David the king says to all the congregation, “Solomon my son,
whom the Lord hath chosen, is young and tender, and the work is great,
because he is not to build for man but for the Lord God.  According to
my whole power I have prepared for the house of my God, gold, silver,
brass, and iron, wood, stones of Soom, and stones for filling up, and
precious stones of many kinds, and all sorts of precious wood, and a
large quantity of Parian marble.  And besides this, for the pleasure I
have taken in the house of my God, the gold and the silver I possess,
lo, I have given it for the house of my Lord, to the full; from such
supplies <span id="fr_5111"></span>[5112](#fn_5111) I prepared for the
house of the saints, three thousand talents of gold from Suphir, and
seven thousand talents of stamped silver. that the houses of God may be
overlaid with them by the hands of artificers.”  For David reigned seven
years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem; <span
id="fr_5112"></span>[5113](#fn_5112) so that if it could be shown that
the beginning of the preparations for the temple and of David’s
collecting the necessary material, was in the fifth year of his reign,
then, with some forcing, the statement about forty-six years might
stand.  But some one else will say that the temple spoken of was not
that built by Solomon, for that it was destroyed at the period of the
captivity, but the temple built at the time of Ezra, <span
id="fr_5113"></span>[5114](#fn_5113) with regard to which the forty-six
years can be shown to be quite accurate.  But in this Maccabean period
things were very unsettled with regard to the people and the temple, and
I do not know if the temple was really built in that number of years. 
Heracleon pays no attention to the history, but says that in that he was
forty-six years preparing the temple, Solomon was an image of the
Saviour.  The number six he connects with matter, that is, the image,
and the number forty, which he says is the tetrad, not admitting of
combination, he connects with the inspiration and the seed in the
inspiration.  Consider if the forty cannot be taken as due to the four
elements of the world arranged in the building of the temple at the
points at issue, <span id="fr_5114"></span>[5115](#fn_5114) and the six
to the fact that man was created on the sixth day.
