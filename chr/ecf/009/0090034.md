<span id="iv.iii.xxv"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="iv.iii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Section XXV.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxv-p2"></span>\[1\]  <span
id="fr_1746"></span>[1747](#fn_1746.md) And in that day this thought
presented itself to his disciples, and they said, which \[2\] haply
should be the great*est* among them. <span
id="fr_1747"></span>[1748](#fn_1747.md)    <span
id="fr_1748"></span>[1749](#fn_1748.md) And when they came to Capernaum,
and entered into the house, Jesus said unto them, What were ye
considering in the \[3\] way among yourselves?   <span
id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749.md) And they were silent because they
had considered that *matter*.

<span id="iv.iii.xxv-p7"></span>\[4\]  <span
id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750.md) And when Simon went forth without,
those that received two dirhams for the tribute came to Cephas, and said
unto him, Doth your master not give his two \[5\] dirhams?  He said unto
them, Yea.   <span id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751.md) And when Cephas
entered the house, Jesus anticipated him, and said unto him, What
thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive
custom and tribute? from their sons, or from \[6\] \[Arabic, p. 97\]
strangers?   <span id="fr_1752"></span>[1753](#fn_1752.md) Simon said unto
him, From strangers.  Jesus said unto him, Children then are free. 
Simon said unto him, Yea.  Jesus said unto him, \[7\] Give thou also
unto them, like the stranger.   <span
id="fr_1753"></span>[1754](#fn_1753.md) But, lest it trouble them, go thou
to the sea, and cast *a* hook; and the first fish that cometh up, open
its mouth, *and* thou shalt find a stater:  take therefore that, and
give for me and thee.

<span id="iv.iii.xxv-p12"></span>\[8\]  <span
id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754.md) And in that hour came the disciples
to Jesus, and said unto him, Who, thinkest \[9\] thou, is greater in the
kingdom of heaven?   <span id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755.md) And
Jesus knew the thought of their heart, and called a <span
id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756.md) child, and set him in the midst,
and took him in his arms, and \[10\] said unto them,  <span
id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757.md) Verily I say unto you, If ye do not
return, and become as children, \[11\] ye shall not enter the kingdom of
heaven.   <span id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758.md) Every one that
shall receive in my name such as this child hath received me:   <span
id="fr_1759"></span>[1760](#fn_1759.md) and whosoever receiveth me
receiveth \[12\] not me, but him that sent me.   <span
id="fr_1760"></span>[1761](#fn_1760.md) And he who is little in your
company, <span id="fr_1761"></span>[1762](#fn_1761.md) the same \[13\]
shall be great.   <span id="fr_1762"></span>[1763](#fn_1762.md) But
whosoever shall injure one of these little ones that believe in me, it
were better for him that a great millstone <span
id="fr_1763"></span>[1764](#fn_1763.md) should be hanged about his neck,
and *he should be* drowned in the depths of the sea.

<span id="iv.iii.xxv-p23"></span>\[14\]  <span
id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764.md) John answered and said, Our Master,
we saw one casting out devils in thy name; \[15\] and we prevented him,
because he followed not thee with us.   <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765.md) Jesus said unto them, Prevent him
not; for no man doeth powers in my name, and can hasten to speak evil
\[16, 17\] of me.   <span id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766.md) Every one
who is not in opposition to you is with you.   <span
id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767.md) Woe unto the world \[Arabic, p.
98\] because of trials! <span id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768.md) but
woe unto that man by whose hand the trials come!  \[18\]  <span
id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769.md) If thy hand or thy foot injure
thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee to
enter into life being halt or maimed, and not that thou shouldest have
two hands or two feet, and fall into the hell of fire that burneth <span
id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770.md) for ever; \[19, 20\]  <span
id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771.md) where their worm dieth not, and
their fire is not quenched.   <span id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772.md)
And if thine eye seduce <span id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773.md)
\[21\] thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee;  <span
id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774.md) for it is better for thee to enter
the kingdom of God with one eye, than that thou shouldest have two eyes,
and fall into the \[22, 23\] fire of Gehenna;  <span
id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775.md) where their worm dieth not, and
their fire is not quenched.   <span id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776.md)
Every \[24\] *one* shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall
be salted with salt.   <span id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777.md) How
good \[25\] is salt! but if the salt also be tasteless, wherewith shall
it be salted?   <span id="fr_1778"></span>[1779](#fn_1778.md) It is fit
neither for the land nor for dung, but they cast it out.  He that hath
ears to hear, let him \[26\] hear.   <span
id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779.md) Have ye salt in yourselves, and be
in peace one with another.

<span id="iv.iii.xxv-p40"></span>\[27\]  <span
id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780.md) And he arose from thence, and came
to the borders of Judæa beyond Jordan:  and there went unto him thither
great multitudes, and he healed them; and he taught \[28\] them also,
according to his custom.   <span id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781.md)
And the Pharisees came unto him, tempting \[29\] him, and asking him, Is
it lawful for a man to put away his wife?   <span
id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782.md) He said, What \[30\] did Moses
command you?   <span id="fr_1783"></span>[1784](#fn_1783.md) They said,
Moses made it allowable for us, *saying*, Whosoever \[31\] will, let him
write a writing of divorcement, and put away his wife.   <span
id="fr_1784"></span>[1785](#fn_1784.md) Jesus <span id="page_83">p.
83</span> <span id="iv.iii.xxv-Page_83"></span>answered and said unto
them,  <span id="fr_1785"></span>[1786](#fn_1785.md) Have ye not read, He
that made *them* from the beginning \[32\] made them male and female,
and said,  <span id="fr_1786"></span>[1787](#fn_1786.md) For this reason
shall the man leave his father \[Arabic, p. 99\] and his mother, and
cleave to his wife; and they both shall be one body?  \[33\]  <span
id="fr_1787"></span>[1788](#fn_1787.md) So then they are not twain, but one
body; the thing, then, which God hath \[34\] joined together, let no man
put asunder.   <span id="fr_1788"></span>[1789](#fn_1788.md) And those
Pharisees said unto him, Why did Moses consent <span
id="fr_1789"></span>[1790](#fn_1789.md) that a *man* should give a writing
of divorcement and put her away?  \[35\]  <span
id="fr_1790"></span>[1791](#fn_1790.md) Jesus said unto them, Moses because
of the hardness of your hearts gave you leave \[36\] to divorce your
wives; but in the beginning it was not so.   <span
id="fr_1791"></span>[1792](#fn_1791.md) I say unto you, Whosoever putteth
away <span id="fr_1792"></span>[1793](#fn_1792.md) his wife without
fornication, and marrieth another, hath exposed \[37\] her to adultery. 
 <span id="fr_1793"></span>[1794](#fn_1793.md) And his disciples, when he
entered the house, asked him again \[38\] about that.   <span
id="fr_1794"></span>[1795](#fn_1794.md) And he said unto them, Every one
who putteth away his wife, and \[39\] marrieth another, hath exposed her
to adultery.   <span id="fr_1795"></span>[1796](#fn_1795.md) And any woman
that leaveth her husband, and becometh another’s, hath committed
adultery.   <span id="fr_1796"></span>[1797](#fn_1796.md) And whosoever
marrieth \[40\] her that is divorced hath committed adultery.   <span
id="fr_1797"></span>[1798](#fn_1797.md) And his disciples said unto him, If
there be between the man and the woman such a case <span
id="fr_1798"></span>[1799](#fn_1798.md) as this, it is not good for \[41\]
a man to marry.   <span id="fr_1799"></span>[1800](#fn_1799.md) He said
unto them, Not every man can endure this saying, except \[42\] him to
whom it is given.   <span id="fr_1800"></span>[1801](#fn_1800.md) There are
eunuchs which from their mother’s womb <span
id="fr_1801"></span>[1802](#fn_1801.md) were born so; and there are eunuchs
which through men became eunuchs; and there are eunuchs which made
themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.  He that is
able to be content, let him be content.

<span id="iv.iii.xxv-p63"></span>\[43\]  <span
id="fr_1802"></span>[1803](#fn_1802.md) Then they brought to him children,
that he should lay his hand upon them, and \[44\] pray:  and his
disciples were rebuking those that were bringing them.   <span
id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803.md) And Jesus saw, and it was
distressing to him; and he said unto them, Suffer the children to
\[Arabic, p. 100\] come unto me, and prevent them not; for those that
are like these have \[45\] the kingdom of God.   <span
id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804.md) Verily I say unto you, Whosoever
receiveth not the \[46\] kingdom of God as this child, shall not enter
it.   <span id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805.md) And he took them in his
arms, and laid his hand upon them, and blessed them.
