id="xvi.ii.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>16.  Gradual Growth in Knowledge of the
Disciples.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xvi-p2"></span>But now we must first investigate the
fact that they were declaring other things about Him as being great and
wonderful, but did not yet proclaim that He was the Christ, lest the
Saviour may not appear to take away from them the authority to announce
that He was the Christ, which He had formerly bestowed upon them.  And
perhaps some one will support an argument of this kind, saying that on
their introduction into the school of Christ the Jews were taught by the
disciples glorious things about Jesus, so that in due season there might
be built upon these as a foundation the things about Jesus being the
Christ; and perhaps many of the things which were said to them were said
to all who virtually believed; for not to the Apostles alone did the
saying apply, “Before governors and kings also shall ye be brought for
My sake for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles;” <span
id="fr_5671"></span>[5672](#fn_5671.md) and perhaps also not to the
Apostles absolutely, but to all who were about to believe the word, “And
brother shall deliver up brother to death,” <span
id="fr_5672"></span>[5673](#fn_5672.md) etc.; but, “Whosoever shall confess
Me,” <span id="fr_5673"></span>[5674](#fn_5673.md) etc., is said not
specially to the Apostles, but also to all believers.  According to
this, then, through that which was said to the Apostles an outline was
given beforehand of the teaching which would afterwards come to be of
service both to them and to every teacher.
