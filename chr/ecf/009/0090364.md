<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>13.  Relation of Men to Angels.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xiii-p2"></span>From this it does not follow, as
some suppose, that the men who are saved in Christ are superior even to
the holy angels; for how can those who are cast by the holy angels into
vessels be compared with those <span id="page_421">p. 421</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xiii-Page_421"></span>who cast them into vessels, seeing
that they have been put under the authority of the angels?  While we say
this, we are not ignorant that the men who will be saved in Christ
surpass some angels—namely, those who have not been entrusted with this
office—but not all of them.  For we read, “Which things angels desire to
look into,” <span id="fr_5215"></span>[5216](#fn_5215.md) where it is not
said “all” angels.  And we know also this—“We shall judge angels” <span
id="fr_5216"></span>[5217](#fn_5216.md) where it is not said “all” angels. 
Now since these things are written about the net and about those in the
net, we say that he who desires that, before the consummation of the
age, and before the coming of the angels to sever the wicked from among
the righteous, there should be no evil persons “of every kind” in the
net, seems not to have understood the Scripture, and to desire the
impossible.  Wherefore let us not be surprised if, before the severing
of the wicked from among the righteous by the angels who are sent forth
for this purpose, we see our gatherings also filled with wicked
persons.  And would that those who will be cast into the furnace of fire
may not be greater in number than the righteous!  But since we said in
the beginning, that the parables and similitudes are not to be accepted
in respect of all the things to which they are likened or compared, but
only in respect of some things, we must further establish from the
things to be said, that in the case of the fishes, so far as their life
is concerned, an evil thing happens to them when they are found in the
net.  For they are deprived of the life which is theirs by nature, and
whether they are cast into vessels or cast away, they suffer nothing
more than the loss of the life as it is in fishes; but, in the case of
those to whom the parable refers, the evil thing is to be in the sea and
not to come into the net, in order to be cast along with the good into
vessels.  And in like manner the bad fishes are cast without and thrown
away; but the bad in the similitude before us are cast into “the furnace
of fire,” that what is said in Ezekiel about the furnace of fire may
also overtake them—“And the Word of the Lord came unto me saying, Son of
man behold the house of Israel is become to me all mixed with brass and
iron,” etc., down to the words, “And ye shall know that I the Lord have
poured My fury upon you.” <span id="fr_5217"></span>[5218](#fn_5217.md)
