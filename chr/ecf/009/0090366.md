<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>15.  The Householder and His
Treasury.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xv-p2"></span>Now since “every scribe who has been
made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a
householder who bringeth forth out of his treasury things new and
old,” <span id="fr_5241"></span>[5242](#fn_5241.md) it clearly follows, by
“conversion of the proposition,” as it is called, that every one who
does not bring forth out of his treasury things new and old, is not a
scribe who has been made a disciple unto the kingdom of heaven.  We must
endeavour, therefore, in every way to gather in our heart, “by giving
heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching,” <span
id="fr_5242"></span>[5243](#fn_5242.md) and by “meditating in the law of
the Lord day and night,” <span id="fr_5243"></span>[5244](#fn_5243.md) not
only the new oracles of the Gospels and of the Apostles and their
Revelation, but <span id="page_423">p. 423</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xv-Page_423"></span>also the old things in the law “which
has the shadow of the good things to come,” <span
id="fr_5244"></span>[5245](#fn_5244.md) and in the prophets who prophesied
in accordance with them.  And these things will be gathered together,
when we also read and know, and remembering them, compare at a fitting
time things spiritual with spiritual, not comparing things that cannot
be compared with one another, but things which admit of comparison, and
which have a certain likeness of diction signifying the same thing, and
of thoughts and of opinions, so that by the mouth of two or three or
more witnesses <span id="fr_5245"></span>[5246](#fn_5245.md) from the
Scripture, we may establish and confirm every word of God.  By means of
them also we must refute those who, as far as in them lies, cleave in
twain the Godhead and cut off the New from the Old, <span
id="fr_5246"></span>[5247](#fn_5246.md) so that they are far removed from
likeness to the householder who brings forth out of his treasury things
new and old.  And since he who is likened to any one is different from
the one to whom he is likened, the scribe “who is made a disciple unto
the kingdom of heaven” will be the one who is likened, but different
from him is the householder “who brings out of his treasury things new
and old.”  But he who is likened to him, as in imitation of him, wishes
to do that which is like.  Perhaps, then, the man who is a householder
is Jesus Himself, who brings forth out of His treasury, according to the
time of the teaching, things new, things spiritual, which also are
always being renewed by Him in the “inner man” of the righteous, who are
themselves always being renewed day by day, <span
id="fr_5247"></span>[5248](#fn_5247.md) and old things, things “written and
engraven on stones,” <span id="fr_5248"></span>[5249](#fn_5248.md) and in
the stony hearts of the old man, so that by comparison of the letter and
by exhibition of the spirit He may enrich the scribe who is made a
disciple unto the kingdom of heaven, and make him like unto Himself;
until the disciple shall be as the Master, imitating first the imitator
of Christ, and after him Christ Himself, according to that which is said
by Paul, “Be ye imitators of me even as I also of Christ.” <span
id="fr_5249"></span>[5250](#fn_5249.md)   And likewise, Jesus the
householder may in the simpler sense bring forth out of His treasury
things new,—that is, the evangelic teaching—and things old,—that is, the
comparison of the sayings which are taken from the law and the prophets,
of which we may find examples in the Gospels.  And with regard to these
things new and old, we must attend also to the spiritual law which says
in Leviticus, “And ye shall eat old things, and the old things of the
old, and ye shall bring forth the old from before the new; and I will
set my tabernacle among you.” <span id="fr_5250"></span>[5251](#fn_5250.md)
  For we eat with blessing the old things,—the prophetic words,—and the
old things of the old things,—the words of the law; and, when the new
and evangelical words came, living according to the Gospel we bring
forth the old things of the letter from before the new, and He sets His
tabernacle in us, fulfilling the promise which He spoke, “I will dwell
among them and walk in them.” <span id="fr_5251"></span>[5252](#fn_5251.md)
