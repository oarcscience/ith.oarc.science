<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>16.  Concerning the Pharisees and
Scribes Tempting Jesus (by Asking) Whether Was Lawful for a Man to Put
Away His Wife for Every Cause.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xvi-p2"></span>After this it is written that
“*there came unto Him the Pharisees tempting Him and saying, Is it
lawful for a man to wife for every cause?*” <span
id="fr_6155"></span>[6156](#fn_6155.md)   Mark, also, has written to the
like effect. <span id="fr_6156"></span>[6157](#fn_6156.md)   Accordingly,
of those who came to Jesus and inquired of Him, there were some who put
questions to tempt Him; and if our Saviour so transcendent was tempted,
which of His disciples who is ordained to teach need be vexed, when he
is tempted by some who inquire, not from the love of learning, but from
the wish to tempt?  And you might find many passages, if you brought
them together, in which the Pharisees tempted our Jesus, and others,
different from them, as a certain lawyer, <span
id="fr_6157"></span>[6158](#fn_6157.md) and perhaps also a scribe, <span
id="fr_6158"></span>[6159](#fn_6158.md) that by bringing together what is
said about those who tempted Him, you might find by investigation what
is useful for this kind of inquiries.  Only, the Saviour, in response to
those who tempted Him, laid down dogmas; for they said, “Is it lawful
for a man to put away his own wife for every cause?” and He answered and
said, “Have ye not read that He who created them from the beginning made
them male and female?” <span id="fr_6159"></span>[6160](#fn_6159.md) etc. 
And I think that the Pharisees put forward this word for this reason,
that they might attack Him whatever He might say; as, for example, if He
had said, “It is lawful,” they would have accused Him of dissolving
marriages for trifles; but, if He had said, “It is not lawful,” they
would have accused Him of permitting a man to dwell with a woman, even
with sins; so, likewise, in the case of the tribute-money, <span
id="fr_6160"></span>[6161](#fn_6160.md) if He had told them to give, they
would have accused Him of making the people subject to the Romans, and
not to the law of God, but if He had told them not to give, they would
have accused Him of creating war and sedition, and of stirring up those
who were not able to stand against so powerful an army.  But they did
not perceive in what way He answered blamelessly and wisely, in the
first place, rejecting the opinion that a wife was to be put away for
every cause, and, in the second place, giving answer to the question
about the bill of divorcement; for He saw that not every cause is a
reasonable ground for the dissolution of marriage, and that the husband
must dwell with the wife as the weaker vessel, giving honour, <span
id="fr_6161"></span>[6162](#fn_6161.md) and bearing her burdens in
sins; <span id="fr_6162"></span>[6163](#fn_6162.md) and by what is written
in Genesis, He puts to shame the Pharisees who boasted in the Scriptures
of Moses, by saying, “Have ye not read that He who created them from the
beginning made them male and female,” etc., and, subjoining to these
words, because of the saying, “And the twain shall become one flesh,”
teaching in harmony with one flesh, namely, “So that they are no more
twain, but one flesh.” <span id="fr_6163"></span>[6164](#fn_6163.md)   And,
as tending to convince them that they should not put away their wife for
every cause, is it said, “What God hath joined together, let not man put
asunder.” <span id="fr_6164"></span>[6165](#fn_6164.md)   It is to be
observed, however, in the exposition of the words quoted from Genesis in
the Gospel, that they <span id="page_506">p. 506</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xvi-Page_506"></span>were not spoken consecutively as
they are written in the Gospel; and I think that it is not even said
about the same persons, namely, of those who were formed after the image
of God, and of those who were formed from the dust of the ground and
from one of the ribs of Adam.  For where it is said, “Male and female
made He them,” <span id="fr_6165"></span>[6166](#fn_6165.md) the reference
is to those formed “after the image,” but where He also said, “For this
cause shall a man leave his own father and mother,” <span
id="fr_6166"></span>[6167](#fn_6166.md) etc., the reference is not to those
formed after the image; for some time after the Lord God formed the man,
taking dust from the ground, and from his side the helpmate.  And mark,
at the same time, that in the case of those who are formed “after the
image,” the words were not “husband and wife” but “male and female.” 
But we have also observed this in the Hebrew, for man is indicated by
the word “is,” but male by the word “zachar,” and again woman by the
word “essa,” but female by the word “agkeba.”  For at no time is it
“woman” or “man” “after the image,” but the superior class, the male,
and the second, the female.  But also if a man leave his mother and his
father, he cleaves not to the female, but to his own wife, and “they
become,” since man and woman are one in flesh, “one flesh.”  Then,
describing what ought to be in the case of those who are joined together
by God, so that they may be joined together in a manner worthy of God,
the Saviour adds, “So that they are no more twain;” <span
id="fr_6167"></span>[6168](#fn_6167.md) and, wherever there is indeed
concord, and unison, and harmony, between husband and wife, when he is
as ruler and she is obedient to the word, “He shall rule over
thee,” <span id="fr_6168"></span>[6169](#fn_6168.md) then of such persons
we may truly say, “They are no more twain.”  Then since it was necessary
that for “him who was joined to the Lord,” it should be reserved “that
he should become one spirit with Him,” <span
id="fr_6169"></span>[6170](#fn_6169.md) in the case of those who are joined
together by God, after the words, “So that they are no more twain,” it
is said, “but one flesh.”  And it is God who has joined together the two
in one so that they are no more twain, from the time that <span
id="fr_6170"></span>[6171](#fn_6170.md) the woman is married to the man. 
And, since God has joined them together, on this account in the case of
those who are joined together by God, there is a “gift”; and Paul
knowing this, that marriage according to the Word of God was a “gift,”
like as holy celibacy was a gift, says, “But I would that all men were
like myself; howbeit, each man hath his own gift from God, one after
this manner, and another after that.” <span
id="fr_6171"></span>[6172](#fn_6171.md)   And those who are joined together
by God both mind and keep the precept, “Husbands love your wives, as
Christ also the church.” <span id="fr_6172"></span>[6173](#fn_6172.md)  
The Saviour then commanded, “What God hath joined together, let not man
put asunder,” <span id="fr_6173"></span>[6174](#fn_6173.md) but man wishes
to put asunder what God hath joined together, when, “falling away from
the sound faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of
demons, through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their
own conscience as with a hot iron, forbidding,” not only to commit
fornication, but “to marry,” <span id="fr_6174"></span>[6175](#fn_6174.md)
he dissolves even those who had been before joined together by the
providence of God.  Let these things then be said, keeping in view what
is expressly said concerning the male and the female, and the man and
the woman, as the Saviour taught in the answer to the Pharisees.
