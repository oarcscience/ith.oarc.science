id="xv.iii.v.xx-p1.1"></span>20.  The Difference Between Not Being
“Sufficient” And Not Being “Worthy.”</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xx-p2"></span>John records that the Baptist said he
was not worthy, Mark that he was not sufficient, and these two are not
the same.  One who was not worthy might yet be sufficient, and one who
was worthy might not be sufficient.  For even if it be the case that
gifts are bestowed to profit withal and not merely according to the
proportion of faith, yet it would seem to be the part of a God who loves
men and who sees before what harm must come from the rise of
self-opinion or conceit, not to bestow sufficiency even on the worthy. 
But it belongs to the goodness of God by conferring bounties to conquer
the object of His bounty, taking in advance him who is destined to be
worthy, and adorning him even before he becomes worthy with sufficiency,
so that after his sufficiency he may come to be worthy; he is not first
to be worthy and then to anticipate the giver and take His gifts before
the time and so arrive at being sufficient.  Now with the three the
Baptist says he is not sufficient, while in John he says he is not
worthy.  But it may be that he who formerly declared that he was not
sufficient became sufficient afterwards, even though perhaps he was not
worthy, or again that while he was saying he was not worthy, and was in
fact not worthy, he arrived at being worthy, unless one should say that
human nature can never come to perform worthily this loosing or this
bearing, and that John, therefore, says truly that he never became
sufficient to loose the latchets of the Saviour’s shoes, nor worthy of
it either.  However much we take into our minds there are still left
things not yet understood; for, as we read in the wisdom of Jesus, son
of Sirach, <span id="fr_4912"></span>[4913](#fn_4912) “When a man hath
done, then he beginneth, and when he leaveth off, then he shall be
doubtful.”
