id="xii.iv.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL.—Let Us Preserve in the Church the
Order Appointed by God.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xl-p2"></span>These things therefore being manifest to
us, and since we look into the depths of the divine knowledge, it
behoves us to do all things in \[their proper\] order, which the Lord
has commanded us to perform at stated times. <span
id="fr_4215"></span>[4216](#fn_4215)   He has enjoined offerings \[to be
presented\] and service to be performed \[to Him\], and that not
thoughtlessly or irregularly, but at the appointed times and hours. 
Where and by whom He desires these things to be done, He Himself has
fixed by His own supreme will, in order that all things, being piously
done according to His good pleasure, may be acceptable unto Him. <span
id="fr_4216"></span>[4217](#fn_4216)   Those, therefore, who present
their offerings at the appointed times, are accepted and blessed; for
inasmuch as they follow the laws of the Lord, they sin not.  For his own
peculiar services are assigned to the high priest, and their own proper
place is prescribed to the priests, and their own special ministrations
devolve on the Levites.  The layman is bound by the laws that pertain to
laymen.
