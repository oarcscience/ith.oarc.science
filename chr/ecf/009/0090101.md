id="xii.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Continuation.  Several Other
Martyrs.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.vi-p2"></span>To these men who spent their lives in the
practice of holiness, there is to be added a great multitude of the
elect, who, having through envy endured many indignities and tortures,
furnished us with a most excellent example.  Through envy, those women,
the Danaids <span id="fr_4032"></span>[4033](#fn_4032.md) and Dircæ, being
persecuted, after they had suffered terrible and unspeakable torments,
finished the course of their faith with stedfastness, <span
id="fr_4033"></span>[4034](#fn_4033.md) and though weak in body, received a
noble reward.  Envy has alienated wives from their husbands, and changed
that saying of our father Adam, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh
of my flesh.” <span id="fr_4034"></span>[4035](#fn_4034.md)   Envy and
strife have overthrown <span id="fr_4035"></span>[4036](#fn_4035.md) great
cities, and rooted up mighty nations.
