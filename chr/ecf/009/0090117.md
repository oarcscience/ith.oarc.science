<span id="xii.iv.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—These Exhortations are
Confirmed by the Christian Faith, Which Proclaims the Misery of Sinful
Conduct.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xxii-p2"></span>Now the faith which is in Christ
confirms all these \[admonitions\].  For He Himself by the Holy Ghost
thus addresses us:  “Come, ye children, hearken unto me; I will teach
you the fear of the Lord. <span id="fr_4105"></span>[4106](#fn_4105.md)  
What man is he that desireth life, and loveth to see good days?  Keep
thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.  Depart from
evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.  The eyes of the Lord are
upon the righteous, and His ears are \[open\] unto their prayers.  The
face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the
remembrance of them from the earth.  The righteous cried, and the Lord
heard him, and delivered him out of all his troubles.” <span
id="fr_4106"></span>[4107](#fn_4106.md)   “Many are the stripes \[appointed
for\] the wicked; but mercy shall compass those about who hope in the
Lord.” <span id="fr_4107"></span>[4108](#fn_4107.md)
