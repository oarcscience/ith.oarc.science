<span id="xvi.ii.v.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>14.  In What Sense the “Keys” Are Given to
Peter, and Every Peter.  Limitations of This Power.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xiv-p2"></span>And after this let us see in what
sense it is said to Peter, and to every Peter, “*I will give unto thee
the keys of the kingdom of heaven.*” <span
id="fr_5652"></span>[5653](#fn_5652.md)   And, in the first place, I think
that the saying, “I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
heaven,” is spoken in consistency with the words, “The gates of Hades
shall not prevail against it.” <span
id="fr_5653"></span>[5654](#fn_5653.md)   For he is worthy to receive from
the same Word the keys of the kingdom of heaven, who is fortified
against the gates of Hades so that they do not prevail against him,
receiving, as it were, for a prize, the keys of the kingdom of heaven,
because the gates of Hades had no power against him, that he might open
for himself the gates that were closed to those who had been conquered
by the gates of Hades.  And he enters in, as a temperate man, through an
opened gate—the gate of temperance—by the key which opens temperance;
and, as a righteous man, by another gate—the gate of righteousness—which
is opened by the key of righteousness; and so with the rest of the
virtues.  For I think that for every virtue of knowledge certain
mysteries of wisdom corresponding to the species of the virtue are
opened up to him who has lived according to virtue; the Saviour giving
to those who are not mastered by the gates of Hades as many keys as
there are virtues, which open gates equal in number, which correspond to
each virtue according to the revelation of the mysteries.  And perhaps,
also, each virtue is a kingdom of heaven, and all together are a kingdom
of the heavens; so that according to this he is already in the kingdom
of the heavens who lives according to the virtues, so that according to
this the saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,” <span
id="fr_5654"></span>[5655](#fn_5654.md) is to be referred, not to the time,
but to deeds and dispositions; for Christ, who is all virtue, has come,
and speaks, and on account of this the kingdom of God is within His
disciples, and not here or there. <span
id="fr_5655"></span>[5656](#fn_5655.md)   But consider how great power the
rock has upon which the church is built by Christ, and how great power
every one has who says, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God,” so that the judgments of this man abide sure, as if God were
judging in him, that in the very act of judging the gates of Hades shall
not prevail against him.  But when one judges unrighteously, and does
not bind upon earth according to the Word of God, nor loose upon earth
according to His will, the gates of Hades prevail against him; but, in
the case of any one against whom the gates of Hades do not prevail, this
man judges righteously.  Wherefore he has the keys of the kingdom of
heaven, opening to those who have been loosed on earth that they may be
also loosed in <span id="page_459">p. 459</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.xiv-Page_459"></span>heaven, and free; and shutting to
those who by his just judgment have been bound on earth that they also
may be bound in heaven, and condemned.  But when those who maintain the
function of the episcopate make use of this word as Peter, and, having
received the keys of the kingdom of heaven from the Saviour, teach that
things bound by them, that is to say, condemned, are also bound in
heaven, and that those which have obtained remission by them are also
loosed in heaven, we must say that they speak wholesomely if they have
the way of life on account of which it was said to that Peter, “Thou art
Peter;” <span id="fr_5656"></span>[5657](#fn_5656.md) and if they are such
that upon them the church is built by Christ, and to them with good
reason this could be referred; and the gates of Hades ought not to
prevail against him when he wishes to bind and loose.  But if he is
tightly bound with the cords of his sins, <span
id="fr_5657"></span>[5658](#fn_5657.md) to no purpose does he bind and
loose.  And perhaps you can say that in the heavens which are in the
wise man—that, is the virtues,—the bad man is bound; and again in these
the virtuous man is loosed, and has received an indemnity for the sins
which he committed before his virtue.  But, as the man, who has not the
cords of sins nor iniquities compared to a “long rope or to the strap of
the yoke of a heifer,” <span id="fr_5658"></span>[5659](#fn_5658.md) not
even God could bind, in like manner, no Peter, whoever he may be; and if
any one who is not a Peter, and does not possess the things here spoken
of, imagines as a Peter that he will so bind on earth that the things
bound are bound in heaven, and will so loose on earth that the things
loosed are loosed in heaven, he is puffed up, not understanding the
meaning of the Scriptures, and, being puffed up, has fallen into the
ruin of the devil. <span id="fr_5659"></span>[5660](#fn_5659.md)
