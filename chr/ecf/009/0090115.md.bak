id="xii.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—The Peace and Harmony of the
Universe.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xx-p2"></span>The heavens, revolving under His
government, are subject to Him in peace.  Day and night run the course
appointed by Him, in no wise hindering each other.  The sun and moon,
with the companies of the stars, roll on in harmony according to His
command, within their prescribed limits, and without any deviation.  The
fruitful earth, according to His will, brings forth food in abundance,
at the proper seasons, for man and beast and all the living beings upon
it, never hesitating, nor changing any of the ordinances which He has
fixed.  The unsearchable places of abysses, and the indescribable
arrangements of the lower world, are restrained by the same laws.  The
vast unmeasurable sea, gathered together by His working into various
basins, <span id="fr_4094"></span>[4095](#fn_4094.md) never passes beyond
the bounds placed around it, but does as He has commanded.  For He said,
“Thus far shalt thou come, and thy waves shall be broken within
thee.” <span id="fr_4095"></span>[4096](#fn_4095.md)   The ocean,
impassable to man and the worlds beyond it, are regulated by the same
enactments of the Lord.  The seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and
winter, peacefully give place <span id="fr_4096"></span>[4097](#fn_4096.md)
to one another.  The winds in their several quarters <span
id="fr_4097"></span>[4098](#fn_4097.md) fulfil, at the proper time, their
service without hindrance.  The ever-flowing fountains, formed both for
enjoyment and health, furnish without fail their breasts for the life of
men.  The very smallest of living beings meet together in peace and
concord.  All these the great Creator and Lord of all has appointed to
exist in peace and harmony; while He does good to all, but most
abundantly to us who have fled for refuge to His compassions through
Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be glory and majesty for ever and ever. 
Amen.
