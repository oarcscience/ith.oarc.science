<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>23.  The Withdrawal of Jesus.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xxiii-p2"></span>And the disciples of John having
come bury his remains, and “*they went and told Jesus.*” <span
id="fr_5324"></span>[5325](#fn_5324.md)   And He withdrew to a desert
place,—that is, the Gentiles—and after the killing of the prophet
multitudes followed Him from the cities everywhere; seeing which to be
great He had compassion on them, and healed their sick; and afterwards
with the loaves which were blessed and multiplied from a few loaves He
feeds those who followed Him.  “*Now when Jesus heard it He withdrew
thence in a boat to a desert place apart.*” <span
id="fr_5325"></span>[5326](#fn_5325.md)   The letter teaches us to withdraw
as far as it is in our power from those who persecute us, and from
expected conspiracies through words; for this would be to act according
to prudence; and, when one can keep outside of critical positions, to go
to meet them is rash and headstrong.  For who would still hesitate about
avoiding such things, when not only did Jesus retreat in view of what
happened to John, but also taught and said, “If they persecute you in
this city, flee ye into the other”? <span
id="fr_5326"></span>[5327](#fn_5326.md)   When a temptation comes which is
not in our power to avoid, we must endure it with exceeding nobleness
and courage; but, when it is in our power to avoid it, not to do so is
rash.  But since after the letter we must also investigate the place
according to the mystical meaning, we must say that, when prophecy was
plotted against among the Jews and destroyed, because of their giving
honour to matters of birthdays, and in respect of their reception of
vain movements which, though conceived by the ruler of the wicked and
those who feast along with him to be regular and pleasing to them, were
irregular and out of tune, if truth be umpire, then Jesus withdraws from
the place in which prophecy was attacked and condemned; and He withdraws
to the place which had been barren of God among the Gentiles, in order
that the Word of God, when the kingdom was taken from the Jews and
“given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof,” <span
id="fr_5327"></span>[5328](#fn_5327.md) might be among the Gentiles; and,
on <span id="page_430">p. 430</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xxiii-Page_430"></span>account of it, “the children of
the desolate one,” who had not been instructed either in the law or the
prophets, “might be more than of her who has the husband,” <span
id="fr_5328"></span>[5329](#fn_5328.md) that is, the law.  When, then, the
word was of old among the Jews, it was not so among them as it is among
the Gentiles; wherefore it is said that, “in a boat,”—that is, in the
body—He went to the desert place apart, when He heard about the killing
of the prophet.  And, having come into the desert place apart, He was in
it, because that the Word dwelt apart, and His teaching was contrary to
the customs and usages which obtained among the Gentiles.  And the
crowds among the Gentiles, when they heard that Jesus had come to stay
in their desert, and that He was apart, as we have already reported,
followed Him from their own cities, because each had left the
superstitious customs of his fathers and come to the law of Christ.  And
by land they followed Him, and not in a boat, inasmuch as not with the
body but with the soul only, and with the resolution to which they had
been persuaded by the Word, they followed the Image of God.  And to them
Jesus comes out, as they were not able to go to Him, in order that,
having gone to those who were without, He might lead within those who
were without.  And great is the crowd without to whom the Word of God
goes out, and, having poured out upon it the light of His “visitation,”
beholds it; and, seeing that they were rather deserving of being pitied,
because they were in such circumstances, as a lover of men He who was
impassible suffered the emotion of pity, and not only had pity but
healed their sick, who had sicknesses diverse and of every kind arising
from their wickedness.
