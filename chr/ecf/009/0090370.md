<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>19.  Relation of Faith and Unbelief to
the Supernatural Powers of Jesus.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xix-p2"></span>Following this you may see, “*He did
not there many mighty works because of their unbelief.*” <span
id="fr_5286"></span>[5287](#fn_5286.md)   We are taught by these things
that powers were found in those who believed, since “to every one that
hath shall be given and he shall have abundance,” <span
id="fr_5287"></span>[5288](#fn_5287.md) but among unbelievers not only did
the powers not work, but as Mark wrote, “They could not work.” <span
id="fr_5288"></span>[5289](#fn_5288.md)   For attend to the words, “He
could not there do any mighty works,” for it is not said, “He would
not,” but “He could not; ”as if there came to the power when working
co-operation from the faith of him on whom the power was working, but
this co-operation was hindered in its exercise by unbelief.  See, then,
that to those who said, “Why could we not cast it out?” He said,
“Because of your little faith.” <span
id="fr_5289"></span>[5290](#fn_5289.md)   And to Peter, when he began to
sink, it was said, “O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou
doubt?” <span id="fr_5290"></span>[5291](#fn_5290.md)   But, moreover, she
who had the issue of blood, who did not ask for the cure, but only
reasoned that if she were to touch the hem of His garment she would be
healed, was healed on the spot.  And the Saviour, acknowledging the
method of healing, says, “Who touched Me?  For I perceived that power
went forth from Me.” <span id="fr_5291"></span>[5292](#fn_5291.md)   And
perhaps, as in the case of material things there exists in some things a
natural attraction towards some other thing, as in the magnet for iron,
and in what is called naphtha for fire, so there is an attraction in
such faith towards the divine power, according to what is said, “If ye
have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain,
Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove.” <span
id="fr_5292"></span>[5293](#fn_5292.md)   And Matthew and Mark, wishing to
set forth the excellency of the divine power, that it has power even in
unbelief, but not so great power as it has in the faith of those who are
being benefited, seem to me to have said with accuracy, not that He did
not “any” mighty works because of their unbelief, but that He did not
“many” there. <span id="fr_5293"></span>[5294](#fn_5293.md)   And Mark also
does not say, that He could not do any mighty work there, and stop at
that point, but added, “Save that He laid His hands upon a few sick folk
and healed them,” <span id="fr_5294"></span>[5295](#fn_5294.md) the power
in Him thus overcoming the unbelief.  Now it seems to me that, as in the
case of material things, tillage is not sufficient in itself for the
gathering in of the fruits, unless the air cooperates to this end, nay,
rather, He who forms the air with whatever quality He wills and makes it
whatever He wills; nor the air apart from tillage, but rather He who by
His providence has enacted that the things which spring up from the
earth could not spring up apart from tillage; for this He has done once
for all in the law, “Let the earth put forth grass sowing seed after its
<span id="page_427">p. 427</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xix-Page_427"></span>kind and after its likeness;” <span
id="fr_5295"></span>[5296](#fn_5295.md) so also neither do the operations
of the powers, apart from the faith of those who are being healed,
exhibit the absolute work of healing, nor faith, however great it may
be, apart from the divine power.  And that which is written about
wisdom, you may apply also to faith, and to the virtues specifically, so
as to make a precept of this kind, “If any one be perfect in wisdom
among the sons of men, and the power that comes from Thee be wanting, he
will be reckoned as nothing;” <span id="fr_5296"></span>[5297](#fn_5296.md)
or, “If any one be perfect in self-control, so far as is possible for
the sons of men, and the control that is from Thee be wanting, he will
be reckoned as nothing;” or, “If any one be perfect in righteousness,
and in the rest of virtues, and the righteousness and the rest of the
virtues that are from Thee be wanting to him, he will be reckoned as
nothing.”  Wherefore, “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, nor the
strong man in his strength,” <span id="fr_5297"></span>[5298](#fn_5297.md)
for that which is fit matter for glorying is not ours, but is the gift
of God; the wisdom is from Him, and the strength is from Him; and so
with the rest.
