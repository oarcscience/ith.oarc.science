<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxxi-p1.1"></span>31.  Christ as Teacher and Master.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxi-p2"></span>It is plain to all how our Lord is a
teacher and an interpreter for those who are striving towards godliness,
and on the other hand a master of those servants who have the spirit of
bondage to fear, <span id="fr_4601"></span>[4602](#fn_4601) who make
progress and hasten towards wisdom, and are found worthy to possess it. 
For <span id="fr_4602"></span>[4603](#fn_4602) “the servant knoweth not
what the master wills,” since he is no longer his master, but has become
his friend.  The Lord Himself teaches this, for He says to hearers who
were still servants: <span id="fr_4603"></span>[4604](#fn_4603)   “You
call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am,” but in another
passage, <span id="fr_4604"></span>[4605](#fn_4604) “I call you no
longer servants, for the servant knoweth not what is the will of his
master, but I call you friends,” because <span
id="fr_4605"></span>[4606](#fn_4605) “you have continued with Me in all
My temptations.”  They, then, who live according to fear, which God
exacts from those who are not good servants, as we read in
Malachi, <span id="fr_4606"></span>[4607](#fn_4606) “If I am a Master,
where is My fear?” are servants of a master who is called their Saviour.
