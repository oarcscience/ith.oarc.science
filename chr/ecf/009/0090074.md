<span id="vii.i-p4"></span> ————————————

<span id="vii.i-p5"></span>The present translation of this
Apocalypse <span id="fr_3951"></span>[3952](#fn_3951.md) is made from the
text as published by Mr. M. R. James in *Texts and Studies*, ii., 3,
from a <span class="sc"><span id="vii.i-p6.1"></span>ms.</span> in the
Bodleian Library, which he assigns to the eleventh century.  The
original he conjecturally assigns to the ninth century, and regards it
as a late and clumsy compilation based on (1) the Assumption Legends and
(2) the Apocalypse of Paul.  Its main feature, intercession for the
lost, it has in common with the Testament of Abraham, the Apocalypse of
Paul, 4 Esdras, the Apocalypse of Baruch, the Apocalypse of Esdras and
the Apocalypse of Sedrach.  Parallels are pointed out in the notes.

<span id="vii.i-p6"></span> In this Apocalypse and that of Sedrach which
follows, the text is in many places so obviously corrupt that the
translator cannot be confident that he has given the correct meaning of
the original in all cases.—A.R.
