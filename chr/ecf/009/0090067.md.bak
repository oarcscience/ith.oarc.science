id="v.i-p3.1"></span>Introduction.</span>

<span id="v.i-p4"></span> ————————————

<span id="v.i-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p5.1"></span>The</span> fragment here translated was discovered
in 1886 by the French Archæological Mission in an ancient burying place
at Akhmîm in Upper Egypt.  It was published at Paris in 1892 (<span
class="sc"><span id="v.i-p5.2"></span>Bouriant,</span> *Mémoires publiés
par les membres de la Mission Archéologique Française au Caire*, T. ix.,
fasc. 1, 1892).  The <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p5.3"></span>ms.</span> is now in the Gizeh Museum and has been
held to be of a date between the eighth and twelfth centuries.  Until
the discovery of the fragment, the following was all that was known
about the Revelation of Peter.

<span id="v.i-p6"></span>1.  The so-called *Muratorian Fragment*, a list
of sacred writings, first published by Muratori in 1740, and found by
him in a seventh or eighth century <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p6.1"></span>ms.</span> belonging to the Ambrosian Library in
Milan, but which had previously belonged to the Columban Monastery of
Bobbio, is assigned on internal evidence to the third quarter of the
second century.  (*Vide* <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p6.2"></span>Westcott</span>, *Canon of the N.T.*, p. 514.)  At
line 69 it says:  “the Apocalypses also of John and Peter only do we
receive, which (latter) some among us would not have read in church.”

<span id="v.i-p7"></span>2.  <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p7.1"></span>Clement</span> of Alexandria (fl. c. 200 <span
class="sc"><span id="v.i-p7.2"></span>a.d.</span>) in his *Hypotoposes*,
according to the testimony of <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p7.3"></span>Eusebius</span>, *H. E*., vi., 14, gave “abridged
accounts of all the canonical Scriptures, not even omitting those that
are disputed, I mean the book of Jude and the other general epistles. 
Also the Epistle of Barnabas and that called the Revelation of Peter.” 
Also in his *Eclogæ Prophetiæ*, chapters 41, 48 and 49, he gives three,
or as some think, four quotations from the Revelation of Peter,
mentioning it twice by name.

<span id="v.i-p8"></span>3.  The *Catalogus Claromontanus*, an Eastern
list of Holy Scriptures, belonging to the third century, gives at the
end the Revelation of Peter (v. <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p8.1"></span>Westcott</span>, *Canon*, p. 555).  This catalogue
gives the length of the various books it enumerates measured in
stichoi.  Our book is said to have two hundred and seventy, which makes
it rather longer than the Epistle to the Colossians which has two
hundred and fifty-one.

<span id="v.i-p9"></span>4.  <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p9.1"></span>Methodius</span>, bishop of Olympus in Lycia in the
beginning of the fourth century, in his *Symposium*, ii., 6, says,
“wherefore we have also learned from divinely inspired Scriptures that
untimely births even if they are the offspring of adultery are delivered
to caretaking angels.”  Though Peter is not here mentioned, the purport
of the passage is the same as that of one of the quotations given by
Clement of Alexandria.

<span id="v.i-p10"></span>5.  <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p10.1"></span>Eusebius</span> († c. 339 <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p10.2"></span>a.d.</span>), in his *Ecclesiastical History*,
iii., 25, expressly mentions the *Revelation of Peter* along with the
*Acts of Paul* and the *Pastor* as spurious books, while at iii., 3, he
says:  “as to that which is called the *Preaching* and that called the
*Apocalypse of Peter*, we know nothing of their being handed down as
Catholic writings.  Since neither among the ancients nor among the
ecclesiastical writers of our own day, has there been anyone that has
appealed to testimony taken from them.”

<span id="v.i-p11"></span>6.  <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p11.1"></span>Macarius Magnes</span> (beginning of fifth
century) in his *Apocritica*, iv., 6, quotes as from a heathen opponent
of Christianity the following:  “Let us by way of superfluity cite also
that saying in the Apocalypse of Peter.  It thus introduces the heaven
as being about to undergo judgment along with the earth.  ‘The earth,’
it says, ‘shall present all men before God at the day of judgment, being
itself also to be judged along with the heaven also which encompasses
it.’”  And at iv., 16, he examines this passage again, naming the
revelation of Peter, and supporting the doctrine of the passage by the
authority of prophecy ([Isaiah xxxiv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004)<span id="v.i-p11.2"></span>.md) and the
Gospel ([Matt. xxiv. 35](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#035.md)<span
id="v.i-p11.3"></span>).

<span id="v.i-p12"></span><span id="page_142">p. 142</span> <span
id="v.i-Page_142"></span>7.  <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p12.1"></span>Sozomen</span> (middle of fifth century), *H. E*.,
vii., 19, says:  “For instance, the so-called Apocalypse of Peter which
was esteemed as entirely spurious by the ancients, we have discovered to
be read in certain churches of Palestine up to the present day, once a
year, on the day of preparation, during which the people most
religiously fast in commemoration of the Saviour’s Passion” (*i.e*., on
Good Friday).  It is to be noted that Sozomen himself belonged to
Palestine.

<span id="v.i-p13"></span>8.  In the list of *the Sixty Books* which is
assigned to the fifth or sixth century the Revelation of Peter is
mentioned among the Apocrypha (v. <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p13.1"></span>Westcott</span>, *Canon*, p. 551).

<span id="v.i-p14"></span>9.  The so-called *Stichometry of Nicephorus*,
a list of scriptures with notes of their extent, ascribed to <span
class="sc"><span id="v.i-p14.1"></span>Nicephorus</span>, Patriarch of
Constantinople, 806–814 <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p14.2"></span>a.d.</span>, includes the Revelation of Peter
among the *antilegomena* or disputed writings of the New Testament, and
gives it three hundred stichoi or thirty more than the above-mentioned
Catalogus Claromontanas.

<span id="v.i-p15"></span>10.  The Armenian annalist Mkhitan (thirteenth
century) in a list of the New Testament antilegomena mentions the
Revelation of Peter, after the *Gospel of Thomas* and before the
*Periodoi Pauli*, and remarks that he has himself copied these books. 
(Cf. Harnack, *<span id="v.i-p15.1"></span>Geschichte der
altchristlichen Literatur*.)

<span id="v.i-p16"></span>Up till lately these facts represented all
that was positively known of the Revelation of Peter.  From them we
gather that it must have been written before the middle of the second
century (so as to be known at Rome and included in the Muratorian
Canon), that it had a wide circulation, that it was for some time very
popular, so that it would appear to have run a considerable chance of
achieving a place in the canon, but that it was ultimately rejected and
in the long run dropped out of knowledge altogether.  But even
previously to the discovery at *Akhmîm*, the general character of the
book had been inferred from the scanty fragments preserved in ancient
writers and from the common elements contained in other and later
apocalyptic writings which seemed to require some such book as the
Revelation of Peter as their ultimate source.  Such writings are the
(Christian) Apocalypse of Esdras, the Vision of Paul, the Passion of S.
Perpetua and the visions contained in the History of Barlaam and
Josaphat.  (Cf. Robinson, *Texts and Studies*, i., 2, p. 37–43, and
Robinson and James, *The Gospel according to Peter and the Revelation of
Peter*, 1892.)

<span id="v.i-p17"></span>The Revelation of Peter affords the earliest
embodiment in Christian literature of those pictorial presentations of
heaven and hell which have exercised so widespread and enduring an
influence.  It has, in its imagery, little or no kinship with the Book
of Daniel, the Book of Enoch, or the Revelation of S. John.  Its only
parallels in canonical scripture, with the notable exception of the
Second Epistle of Peter, are to be found in [Isa.
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md), [Mark
9:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#044.md),
[48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#048.md)<span id="v.i-p17.1"></span>, and
the parable of Dives and Lazarus in [Luke xvi.
19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md)<span id="v.i-p17.2"></span>.  It is
indeed Judaic in the severity of its morality and even in its
phraseology (*cf*. the frequent use of the word *righteous*, and the
idea that God and not Christ will come to judge sinners).  But the true
parallels for, if not the sources of, its imagery of the rewards and
punishments which await men after death are to be found in Greek beliefs
which have left their traces in such passages as the Vision of Er at the
end of Plato’s *Republic*.

<span id="v.i-p18"></span>The heaven of the Petrine Apocalypse is akin
to the Elysian Fields and the Islands of the Blest.  In it the saints
are crowned as with flowers and beautiful of countenance, singing songs
of praise in the fragrant air, in a land all lighted up with the light
of the sun. <span id="fr_3875"></span>[3876](#fn_3875.md)   We are reminded
of “the Elysian Fields and the world’s end where is Rhadamanthus of the
fair hair, where life is easiest for men.  No snow is there, nor yet
great storm, nor any rain; but alway Ocean sendeth forth the breeze of
the shrill West to blow cool on men” (*Odyssey*, iv., 563), and of the
garden of the gods on Olympus, which “is not shaken by winds, or ever
wet with rain, nor doth the snow come nigh thereto, but most clear air
is spread about it cloudless, and the white light floats over it”
(*Odyssey*, vi., 43, Butcher and Lang’s transl.).  Perhaps the most
striking parallel of all is afforded by the fragment of a dirge of
Pindar:  “For them shineth below the strength of the sun, while in our
world it is night, and the space of crimson-flowered meadow before their
city is full of the shade of frankincense trees, and of fruits of gold. 
And some in horses, and in bodily <span id="page_143">p. 143</span>
<span id="v.i-Page_143"></span>feats, and some in dice, and some in
harp-playing have delight; and among them thriveth all fair-flowering
bliss; and fragrance streameth ever through the lovely land, as they
mingle incense of every kind upon the altars of the gods” (Pindar, E.
Myer’s transl., p. 176).  Beside this heaven the New Jerusalem of the
canonical Apocalypse is austere.  But it is the spiritual city.  “For
the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon to shine on it, for
the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb were in the midst of it and the Lamb
was the light thereof.”

<span id="v.i-p26"></span>So likewise in the case of the torments of the
wicked as presented in the Revelation of Peter.  We are not here in the
Jewish Sheol, or among the fires of the valley of Hinnom, so much as
among the tortures of Tartarus and the boiling mud of the Acherusian
Lake (*cf*. Plato, *Phædo*, p. 113; Aristophanes, *Frogs*, line 145), or
where “wild men of fiery aspect…seized and carried off several of them,
and Ardiæus and others, they bound head and foot and hand, and threw
them down and flayed them with scourges, and dragged them along the road
at the side, carding them on thorns like wool, and declaring to the
passers-by what were their crimes, and that they were being taken away
to be cast into hell” (*Republic*, x., p. 616, Jowett’s transl.).  It is
not surprising that in later visions of the same kind the very names of
the Greek under-world are ascribed to localities of hell.  It is across
the river Oceanus.  It is called Tartarus.  In it is the Acherusian
Lake.  Notice in this connection that the souls of innocent victims are
present along with their murderers to accuse them.

<span id="v.i-p27"></span>The Revelation of Peter shows remarkable
kinship in ideas with the Second Epistle of Peter.  The parallels will
be noted in the margin of the translation.  It also presents notable
parallels to the Sibylline Oracles (*cf. Orac. Sib*., ii., 225 sqq.),
while its influence has been conjectured, almost with certainty, in the
Acts of Perpetua and the visions narrated in the Acts of Thomas and the
History of Barlaam and Josaphat.  It certainly was one of the sources
from which the writer of the Vision of Paul drew.  And directly or
indirectly it may be regarded as the parent of all the mediæval visions
of the other world.

<span id="v.i-p28"></span>The fragment begins in the middle of an
eschatological discourse of Jesus, probably represented as delivered
after the resurrection, for verse 5 implies that the disciples had begun
to preach the Gospel.  It ends abruptly in the course of a catalogue of
sinners in hell and their punishments.  The fragments preserved in the
writings of Clement of Alexandria and Methodius probably belonged to the
lost end of the book; that preserved by Macarius Magnes may have
belonged to the eschatological discourse at the beginning.  Taking the
length of the whole at from two hundred and seventy to three hundred
stichoi, the Akhmîm fragment contains about the half.

<span id="v.i-p29"></span>The present translation is made from Harnack’s
edition of the text, 2d ed., Leipzig, 1893.

<span id="v.i-p30"></span>There is another and later Apocalypse of Peter
in Arabic, of which <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p30.1"></span>mss.</span> exist in Rome and Oxford.  It is
called the *Apocalypse of Peter, or the narrative of things revealed to
him by Jesus Christ which had taken place from the beginning of the
world and which shall take place till the end of the world or the second
coming of Christ*.  The book is said to have been written by Clement, to
whom Peter had communicated the secrets revealed to him.  The writer
himself calls the book *Librum Perfectionis* or *Librum Completum*. 
Judging from the analysis of its contents quoted by Tischendorf
(*Apocalypses Apocr*.) it has no connection with the present work.
