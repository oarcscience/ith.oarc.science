<span id="xvi.ii.vii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>3.  The Harmony of Body, Soul, and
Spirit.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.iii-p2"></span>And next to this about the married,
I am familiar also with another interpretation of the agreement between
the two which is as follows.  In the wicked, sin reigns over the soul,
being settled as on its own throne in this mortal body, so that the soul
obeys the lusts thereof; <span id="fr_6063"></span>[6064](#fn_6063.md) but
in the case of those, who have stirred up the sin which formerly reigned
over the body as from a throne and who are in conflict with it, “the
flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the
flesh;” <span id="fr_6064"></span>[6065](#fn_6064.md) but in the case of
those who have now become perfected, the spirit has gained the mastery
and put to death the deeds of the body, and imparts to the body of its
own life, so that already this is fulfilled, “He shall quicken also your
mortal bodies because of His Spirit that dwelleth in you;” <span
id="fr_6065"></span>[6066](#fn_6065.md) and there arises a concord of the
two, body and spirit, on the earth, on the successful accomplishment of
which there is sent up a harmonious prayer also of him who “with the
heart believes unto righteousness, but with the mouth maketh confession
unto salvation,” <span id="fr_6066"></span>[6067](#fn_6066.md) so that the
heart is no longer far from God, and along with this the righteous man
draws nigh to God with his own lips and mouth.  But still more blessed
is it if the three be gathered together in the name of Jesus that this
may be fulfilled, “May God sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and
soul and body be preserved entire without blame at the coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ.” <span id="fr_6067"></span>[6068](#fn_6067.md)   But
some one may inquire with regard to the concord of spirit and body
spoken of, if it is possible for these to be at concord without the
third being so,—I mean the soul—and whether it does not follow from the
concord of these on the earth after the two have been gathered together
in the name of Christ, that the three also are already gathered together
in His name, in the midst of whom comes the Son of God as all are
dedicated to Him,—I mean the three,—and no one is opposed to Him, there
being no antagonism not only on the part of the spirit, but not even of
the soul, nor further of the body.
