<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>23.  Peter as a Stumbling-Block to
Jesus.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxiii-p2"></span>Next we must inquire how He said to
Peter, “Thou art a stumbling-block unto Me,” <span
id="fr_5708"></span>[5709](#fn_5708) especially when David says, “Great
peace have they that love Thy law, and there is no stumbling-block to
them.” <span id="fr_5709"></span>[5710](#fn_5709)   For some one will
say, if this is said in the prophet, because of the steadfastness of
those who have love, and are incapable of being offended, for “love
beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
all things, love never faileth,” <span
id="fr_5710"></span>[5711](#fn_5710) how did the Lord Himself, “who
upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all that be bowed down,” <span
id="fr_5711"></span>[5712](#fn_5711) say to Peter, “Thou art a
stumbling-block unto Me”?  But it must be said that not only the
Saviour, but also he who is perfected in love, cannot be offended.  But,
so far as it depends on himself, he who says or does such things is a
stumbling-block even to him who will not be offended; unless perhaps
Jesus calls the disciple who sinned a stumbling-block even to Himself,
as much more than Paul He would have said from love, “Who is weak, and I
am not weak?  Who is made to stumble, and I burn not?” <span
id="fr_5712"></span>[5713](#fn_5712)   In harmony with which we may put,
“Who is made to stumble, and I am not made to stumble?”  But if Peter,
at that time because of the saying, “God be propitious to Thee, Lord,
this shall not be unto Thee,” <span id="fr_5713"></span>[5714](#fn_5713)
was called a stumbling-block by Jesus, as not minding the things of God
in what he said but the things of men, what is to be said about all
those who profess to be made disciples of Jesus, but do not mind the
things of God, and do not look to things unseen and eternal, but mind
the things of man, and look to things seen and temporal, <span
id="fr_5714"></span>[5715](#fn_5714) but that such still more would be
stigmatized by Jesus as a stumbling-block to Him, and because
stumbling-blocks to Him, as stumbling-blocks to His brethren also?  As
in regard to them He says, “I was thirsty and ye gave Me no
drink,” <span id="fr_5715"></span>[5716](#fn_5715) etc., so also He
might say, “When I was running ye caused Me to stumble.”  Let us not
therefore suppose that it is a trivial sin to mind the things of men,
since we ought in everything to mind the things of God.  And it will be
appropriate also to say this to every one that has fallen away from the
doctrines of God and the words of the church and a true mind; as, for
example, to him who minds as true the teaching of Basilides, or
Valentinus, or Marcion, or any one of those who teach the things of men
as the things of God.
