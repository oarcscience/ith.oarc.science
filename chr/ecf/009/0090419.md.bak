<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>22.  Importance of the Expressions
“Behind” And “Turned.”</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxii-p2"></span>But you will compare together His
saying to Peter, “Get thee behind me, Satan,” <span
id="fr_5700"></span>[5701](#fn_5700.md) with that said to the devil (who
said to Him, “All these things will I give Thee if Thou wilt fall down
and worship me”), <span id="fr_5701"></span>[5702](#fn_5701.md) “get thee
hence,” <span id="fr_5702"></span>[5703](#fn_5702.md) without the addition,
“behind Me;” for to be behind Jesus is a good thing.  Wherefore it was
said, “Come ye behind Me and I will make you fishers of men.” <span
id="fr_5703"></span>[5704](#fn_5703.md)   And to the same effect is the
saying, “He that doth not take his cross and follow behind Me is not
worthy of Me.” <span id="fr_5704"></span>[5705](#fn_5704.md)  And as a
general principle observe the expression “behind”; because it is a good
thing when any one goes behind the Lord God and is behind the Christ;
but it is the opposite when any one casts the words of God behind him,
or when he transgresses the commandment which says, “Do not walk behind
thy lusts.” <span id="fr_5705"></span>[5706](#fn_5705.md)   And Elijah
also, in the third Book of Kings, says to the people, “How long halt ye
on both your knees?  If God is the Lord, go behind Him, but if Baal is
the Lord, go behind him.” <span id="fr_5706"></span>[5707](#fn_5706.md)  
And Jesus says this to Peter when He “turned,” and He does so by way of
conferring a favour.  And if therefore you will collect more
illustrations of the “having turned,” and especially those which are
ascribed to Jesus, and compare them with one another, you would find
that the expression is not superfluous.  But it is sufficient at present
to bring forward this from the Gospel according to John, “Jesus turned
and beheld them”—clearly, Peter and Andrew—“following, and saith unto
them, What seek ye?” <span id="fr_5707"></span>[5708](#fn_5707.md)   For
observe that, when He “turned,” it is for the advantage of those to whom
He turned.
