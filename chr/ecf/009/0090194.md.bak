id="xv.ii-p1.1"></span>Letter of Origen to Gregory.</span>

<span id="xv.ii-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xv.ii-p3"></span>When and to whom the Learning derived from
Philosophy may be of Service for the Exposition of the Holy Scriptures;
with a lively Personal Appeal.

<span id="xv.ii-p4"></span>This letter to Gregory, afterwards bishop of
Cæsarea, and called Thaumaturgus, was preserved in the Philocalia, or
collection of extracts from Origen’s works drawn up by Gregory of Nyssa
and Basil of Cæsarea.  It is printed by Delarue and Lommatzsch in the
forefront of their editions of the works.  It forms a good preface to
the commentaries, as it shows how Origen considered the study of
Scripture to be the highest of all studies, and how he regarded
scientific learning, in which he was himself a master, as merely
preparatory for this supreme learning.  Dräseke <span
id="fr_4445"></span>[4446](#fn_4445.md) has shown that it was written about
235, when Origen, after having had Gregory as his pupil at Cæsarea for
some years, had fled before the persecution under Maximinus Thrax to
Cappadocia; while Gregory, to judge from the tenor of this Epistle, had
gone to Egypt.  The Panegyric on Origen, <span
id="fr_4446"></span>[4447](#fn_4446.md) pronounced by Gregory at Cæsarea
about 239, when the school had reassembled there after the persecution,
shows that the master’s solicitude for his pupil’s true advancement was
not disappointed.

<span id="xv.ii-p7"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xv.ii-p7.1"></span>1.  Gregory is Urged to Apply His Gentile
Learning to the Study of Scripture.</span>

<span id="xv.ii-p8"></span>All hail to thee in God, most excellent and
reverend Sir, son Gregory, from Origen.  A natural quickness of
understanding is fitted, as you are well aware, if it be diligently
exercised, to produce a work which may bring its owner so far as is
possible, if I may so express myself, to the consummation of the art the
which he desires to practise, and your natural aptitude is sufficient to
make you a consummate Roman lawyer and a Greek philosopher too of the
most famous schools.  But my desire for you has been that you should
direct the whole force of your intelligence to Christianity as your end,
and that in the way of production.  And I would wish that you should
take with you on the one hand those parts of the philosophy of the
Greeks which are fit, as it were, to serve as general or preparatory
studies for Christianity, and on the other hand so much of Geometry and
Astronomy as may be helpful for the interpretation of the Holy
Scriptures.  The children of the philosophers speak of geometry and
music and grammar and rhetoric and astronomy as being ancillary to
philosophy; and in the same way we might speak of philosophy itself as
being ancillary to Christianity.

<span id="xv.ii-p9"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xv.ii-p9.1"></span>2.  This Procedure is Typified by the Story of
the Spoiling of the Egyptians.</span>

<span id="xv.ii-p10"></span>It is something of this sort perhaps that is
enigmatically indicated in the directions God is represented in the Book
of Exodus <span id="fr_4447"></span>[4448](#fn_4447.md) as giving to the
children of Israel.  They are directed to beg from their neighbours and
from those dwelling in their tents vessels of silver and of gold, and
raiment; thus they are to spoil the Egyptians, and to obtain materials
for making the things they are told to provide in connection with the
worship of God.  For out of the things of which the children of Israel
spoiled the Egyptians the furniture of the Holy of Holies was made, the
ark with its cover, and the cherubim and the mercy-seat and the gold jar
in which the manna, that bread of angels, was stored.  These probably
were made from the finest of the gold of the Egyptians, and from a
second quality, perhaps, the solid golden candlestick which stood near
the inner veil, and the lamps on it, and the golden table on which stood
the shewbread, and between these two the golden altar of incense.  And
if there was gold of a third and of a fourth quality, the sacred vessels
were made of it.  And of the Egyptian silver, too, other things were
made; for it was from their sojourn in Egypt that the children of Israel
derived the great advantage of being supplied with such a quantity of
precious materials for the use of the service of God.  Out of the
Egyptian raiment probably were made all those requisites named in
Scripture in embroidered work; the embroiderers working <span
id="fr_4448"></span>[4449](#fn_4448.md) with the wisdom of God, <span
id="fr_4449"></span>[4450](#fn_4449.md) such garments for such purposes, to
produce the hangings and the inner and outer courts.  This is not a
suitable opportunity to enlarge on such a theme or to show in how many
ways the children of Israel found those things useful which they got
from the Egyptians.  The Egyptians had not made a proper use of them;
but the Hebrews used them, for the wisdom of God was with them, for
religious purposes.  Holy Scripture knows, however, that it was an evil
thing to descend from the land of the children of Israel into Egypt; and
in this a great truth is wrapped up.  For some it is of evil that they
should dwell <span id="page_296">p. 296</span> <span
id="xv.ii-Page_296"></span>with the Egyptians, that is to say, with the
learning of the world, after they have been enrolled in the law of God
and in the Israelite worship of Him.  Ader the Edomite, <span
id="fr_4450"></span>[4451](#fn_4450.md) as long as he was in the land of
Israel and did not taste the bread of the Egyptians, made no idols; but
when he fled from the wise Solomon and went down into Egypt, as one who
had fled from the wisdom of God he became connected with Pharaoh,
marrying the sister of his wife, and begetting a son who was brought up
among the sons of Pharaoh.  Therefore, though he did go back to the land
of Israel, he came back to it to bring division into the people of God,
and to cause them to say to the golden calf, “These are thy gods, O
Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.”  I have learned
by experience and can tell you that there are few who have taken of the
useful things of Egypt and come out of it, and have then prepared what
is required for the service of God; but Ader the Edomite on the other
hand has many a brother.  I mean those who, founding on some piece of
Greek learning, have brought forth heretical ideas, and have as it were
made golden calves in Bethel, which is, being interpreted, the house of
God.  This appears to me to be intended to convey that such persons set
up their own images in the Scriptures in which the Word of God dwells,
and which therefore are tropically called Bethel.  The other image is
said in the word to have been set up in Dan.  Now the borders of Dan are
at the extremities and are contiguous to the country of the heathens, as
is plainly recorded in the Book of Jesus, son of Nave.  Some of these
images, then, are close to the borders of the heathen, which the
brothers, as we showed, of Ader have devised.

<span id="xv.ii-p15"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xv.ii-p15.1"></span>3.  Personal Appeal.</span>

<span id="xv.ii-p16"></span>Do you then, sir, my son, study first of all
the divine Scriptures.  Study them I say.  For we require to study the
divine writings deeply, lest we should speak of them faster than we
think; and while you study these divine works with a believing and
God-pleasing intention, knock at that which is closed in them, and it
shall be opened to thee by the porter, of whom Jesus says, <span
id="fr_4451"></span>[4452](#fn_4451.md) “To him the porter openeth.”  While
you attend to this divine reading seek aright and with unwavering faith
in God the hidden sense which is present in most passages of the divine
Scriptures.  And do not be content with knocking and seeking, for what
is most necessary for understanding divine things is prayer, and in
urging us to this the Saviour says not only, <span
id="fr_4452"></span>[4453](#fn_4452.md) “Knock, and it shall be opened to
you,” and “Seek, and ye shall find,” but also “Ask, and it shall be
given you.”  So much I have ventured on account of my fatherly love to
you.  Whether I have ventured well or not, God knows, and His Christ,
and he who has part of the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ.  May
you partake in these; may you have an always increasing share of them,
so that you may be able to say not only, “We are partakers of
Christ,” <span id="fr_4453"></span>[4454](#fn_4453.md) but also “We are
partakers of God.”
