<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxxi-p1.1"></span>31.  The Simpler Interpretation of the
Promise About Not Tasting of Death.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxi-p2"></span>“*Verily I say unto you there be some
of them that stand here that shall not taste of death.*” <span
id="fr_5750"></span>[5751](#fn_5750)   Some refer these things to the
going up—six days after, or, as Luke says, <span
id="fr_5751"></span>[5752](#fn_5751) eight days—of the three disciples
into the high mountain with Jesus apart; and those who adopt this
interpretation say that Peter and the remaining two did not taste of
death before they saw the Son of man coming in His own kingdom and in
His own glory.  For when they saw Jesus transfigured before them so that
“His face shone,” etc., “they saw the kingdom of God coming with
power.” <span id="fr_5752"></span>[5753](#fn_5752)   For even as some
spear-bearers stand around a king, so Moses and Elijah appeared to those
who had gone up into the mountains, talking with Jesus.  But it is worth
while considering whether the sitting on the right hand and on the left
hand of the Saviour in His kingdom refers to them, so that the words,
“But for whom it is prepared,” were <span
id="fr_5753"></span>[5754](#fn_5753) spoken because of them.  Now this
interpretation about the three Apostles not tasting of death until they
have seen Jesus transfigured, is adapted to those who are designated by
Peter as “new-born babes longing for the reasonable milk which is
without guile,” <span id="fr_5754"></span>[5755](#fn_5754) to whom Paul
says, “I have fed you with milk, not with meat,” <span
id="fr_5755"></span>[5756](#fn_5755) etc.  Now, too, every
interpretation of a text which is able to build up those who cannot
receive greater truths might reasonably be called milk, flowing from the
holy ground of the Scriptures, which flows with <span id="page_467">p.
467</span> <span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxi-Page_467"></span>milk and honey.  But
he who has been weaned, like Isaac, <span
id="fr_5756"></span>[5757](#fn_5756) worthy of the good cheer and
reception which Abraham gave at the weaning of his son, would seek here
and in every Scripture food which is different, I think, from that which
is meat, indeed, but is not solid food, and from what are figuratively
called herbs, which are food to one who has been weaned and is not yet
strong but weak, according to the saying, “He that is weak eateth
herbs.” <span id="fr_5757"></span>[5758](#fn_5757)   In like manner also
he who has been weaned, like Samuel, and dedicated by his mother to
God, <span id="fr_5758"></span>[5759](#fn_5758) —she was Hannah, which
is, by interpretation, grace,—would be also a son of grace, seeking,
like one nurtured in the temple, flesh of God, the holy food of those
who are at once perfect and priests.
