<span id="xv.iii.i.i-p4"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.i-p4.1"></span>1.  How Christians are the Spiritual
Israel.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.i-p5"></span>That people which was called of old the
people of God was divided into twelve tribes, and over and above the
other tribes it had the levitical order, which itself again carried on
the service of God in various priestly and levitical suborders.  In the
same manner, it appears to me that the whole people of Christ, when we
regard it in the aspect of the hidden man of the heart, <span
id="fr_4454"></span>[4455](#fn_4454.md) that people which is called “Jew
inwardly,” and is circumcised in the spirit, has in a more mystic way
the characteristics of the tribes.  This may be more plainly gathered
from John in his Apocalyse, though the other prophets also do not by any
means conceal the state of matters from those who have the faculty of
hearing them.  John speaks as follows: <span
id="fr_4455"></span>[4456](#fn_4455.md)   “And I saw another angel
ascending from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God, and he
cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt
the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not either the earth, or the sea, or
the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their
foreheads.  And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred
and forty-four thousand who were sealed, out of every tribe of the
children of Israel; of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand, of
the tribe of Roubem twelve thousand.”  And he mentioned each of the
tribes singly, with the exception of Dan.  Then, some way further
on, <span id="fr_4456"></span>[4457](#fn_4456.md) he continues:  “And I
saw, and behold the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred
and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father
written on their foreheads.  And I heard a voice from heaven as the
voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder.  And the
voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers harping with their
harps; and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four
beasts and the elders, and no one could learn the song but the hundred
and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth.  These
are they which were not defiled with women, for they are virgins.  These
are they who follow the Lamb whithersover He goeth.  These were
purchased from among men, a first fruits to God and to the Lamb; and in
their mouth was found no lie, for they are without blemish.”  Now this
is said in John with reference to those who have believed in Christ, for
they also, even if their bodily descent cannot be traced to the seed of
the Patriarchs, are yet gathered out of the tribes.  That this is so we
may conclude from what is further said about them:  “Hurt not,” he says,
“the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants
of our God on their foreheads.  And I heard the number of them that were
sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed from every tribe of
the children of Israel.”
