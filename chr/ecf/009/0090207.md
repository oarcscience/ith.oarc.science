<span id="xv.iii.i.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xi-p1.1"></span>11.  Jesus is All Good Things; Hence the
Gospel is Manifold.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xi-p2"></span>Let no one wonder if we have understood
Jesus to be announced in the Gospel under a plurality of names of good
things.  If we look at the things by the names of which the Son of God
is called, we shall understand how many good things Jesus is, whom those
preach whose feet are beautiful.  One good thing is life; but Jesus is
the life.  Another good thing is the light of the world, when it is true
light, and the light of men; and all these things the Son of God is said
to be.  And another good thing which one may conceive to be in addition
to life or light is the truth.  And a fourth in addition to time is the
way which leads to the truth.  And all these things our Saviour teaches
that He is, <span id="page_303">p. 303</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.xi-Page_303"></span>when He says: <span
id="fr_4500"></span>[4501](#fn_4500)   “I am the way and the truth and
the life.”  Ah, is not that good, to shake off earth and mortality, and
to rise again, obtaining this boon from the Lord, since He is the
resurrection, as He says: <span id="fr_4501"></span>[4502](#fn_4501)  
“I am the resurrection.”  But the door also is a good, through which one
enters into the highest blessedness.  Now Christ says: <span
id="fr_4502"></span>[4503](#fn_4502)   “I am the door.”  And what need
is there to speak of wisdom, which “the Lord created <span
id="fr_4503"></span>[4504](#fn_4503) the first principle of His ways,
for His works,” in whom the father of her rejoiced, delighting in her
manifold intellectual beauty, seen by the eyes of the mind alone, and
provoking him to love who discerns her divine and heavenly charm?  A
good indeed is the wisdom of God, proclaimed along with the other good
foresaid by those whose feet are beautiful.  And the power of God is the
eighth good we enumerate, which is Christ.  Nor must we omit to mention
the Word, who is God after the Father of all.  For this also is a good,
less than no other.  Happy, then, are those who accept these goods and
receive them from those who announce the good tidings of them, those
whose feet are beautiful.  Indeed even one of the Corinthians to whom
Paul declared that he knew nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified,
should he learn Him who for our sakes became man, and so receive Him, he
would become identified with the beginning of the good things we have
spoken of; by the man Jesus he would be made a man of God, and by His
death he would die to sin.  For “Christ, <span
id="fr_4504"></span>[4505](#fn_4504) in that He died, died unto sin
once.”  But from His life, since “in that He liveth, He liveth unto
God,” every one who is conformed to His resurrection receives that
living to God.  But who will deny that righteousness, essential
righteousness, is a good, and essential sanctification, and essential
redemption?  And these things those preach who preach Jesus,
saying <span id="fr_4505"></span>[4506](#fn_4505) that He is made to be
of God righteousness and sanctification and redemption.  Hence we shall
have writings about Him without number, showing that Jesus is a
multitude of goods; for from the things which can scarcely be numbered
and which have been written we may make some conjecture of those things
which actually exist in Him in whom <span
id="fr_4506"></span>[4507](#fn_4506) “it pleased God that the whole
fulness of the Godhead should dwell bodily,” and which are not contained
in writings.  Why should I say, “are not contained in writings”?  For
John speaks of the whole world in this connection, and says: <span
id="fr_4507"></span>[4508](#fn_4507)   “I suppose that not even the
world itself would contain the books which would be written.”  Now to
say that the Apostles preach the Saviour is to say that they preach
these good things.  For this is He who received from the good Father
that He Himself should be these good things, so that each man receiving
from Jesus the thing or things he is capable of receiving may enjoy good
things.  But the Apostles, whose feet were beautiful, and those
imitators of them who sought to preach the good tidings, could not have
done so had not Jesus Himself first preached the good tidings to them,
as Isaiah says: <span id="fr_4508"></span>[4509](#fn_4508)   “I myself
that speak am here, as the opportunity on the mountains, as the feet of
one preaching tidings of peace, as one preaching good things; for I will
make My salvation to be heard, saying, God shall reign over thee, O
Zion!”  For what are the mountains on which the speaker declares that He
Himself is present, but those who are less than none of the highest and
the greatest of the earth?  And these must be sought by the able
ministers of the New Covenant, in order that they may observe the
injunction which says: <span id="fr_4509"></span>[4510](#fn_4509)   Go
up into a high mountain, thou that preachest good tidings to Zion; thou
that preachest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with
strength!”  Now it is not wonderful if to those who are to preach good
tidings Jesus Himself preaches good tidings of good things, which are no
other than Himself; for the Son of God preaches the good tidings of
Himself to those who cannot come to know Him through others.  And He who
goes up into the mountains and preaches good things to them, being
Himself instructed by His good Father, <span
id="fr_4510"></span>[4511](#fn_4510) who “makes His sun to rise on the
evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust,” He
does not despise those who are poor in soul.  To them He preaches good
tidings, as He Himself bears witness to us when He takes Isaiah <span
id="fr_4511"></span>[4512](#fn_4511) and reads:  “The spirit of the Lord
is upon me, for the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the
poor, He hath sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives, and sight to
the blind.  For closing the book He handed it to the minister and sat
down.  And when the eyes of all were fastened upon Him, He said, This
day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.”
