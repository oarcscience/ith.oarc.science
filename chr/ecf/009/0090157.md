id="xii.iv.lxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXII.—Summary and
Conclusory—Concerning Godliness.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.lxii-p2"></span>Concerning the things pertaining to our
religious observance which are most profitable for a life of goodness to
those who would pursue a godly and righteous course, we have <span
id="page_248">p. 248</span> <span
id="xii.iv.lxii-Page_248"></span>written to you, men and brethren, at
sufficient length.  For concerning faith and repentance and true love
and continence and soberness and patience, we have touched upon every
passage, putting you in mind that you ought in righteousness and truth
and long-suffering to be well-pleasing <span
id="fr_4323"></span>[4324](#fn_4323.md) to Almighty God with holiness,
being of one mind—not remembering evil—in love and peace with instant
gentleness, even as also our fathers forementioned found favour by the
humility of their thoughts towards the Father and God and Creator and
all mankind.  And of these things we put you in mind with the greater
pleasure, since we were well assured that we were writing to men who
were faithful and of highest repute and had peered into the oracles of
the instruction of God.
