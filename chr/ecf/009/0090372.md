<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>21.  Herod and the Baptist.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xxi-p2"></span>The narrative of Matthew is as
follows,—“*for Herod had laid hold on John and bound him in the
prison.*” <span id="fr_5311"></span>[5312](#fn_5311)   In reference to
these things, it seems to me, that as the law and the prophets were
until John, <span id="fr_5312"></span>[5313](#fn_5312) after whom the
grace of prophecy ceased from among the Jews; so the authority of those
who had rule among the people, which included the power to kill those
whom they thought worthy of death, existed until John; and when the last
of the prophets was unlawfully killed by Herod, the king of the Jews was
deprived of the power of putting to death; for, if Herod had not been
deprived of it, Pilate would not have condemned Jesus to death; but for
this Herod would have sufficed along with the council of the chief
priests and elders of the people, met for the purpose.  And then I think
was fulfilled that which was spoken as follows by Jacob to Judah:  “A
ruler shall not depart from Judah, nor a leader from Israel, until that
come which is laid up in store, and he is the expectation of the
Gentiles.” <span id="fr_5313"></span>[5314](#fn_5313)   And perhaps also
the Jews were deprived of this power, the Providence of God arranging
for the spread of the teaching of Christ among the people, so that even
if this were hindered by the Jews, the opposition might not go so far as
the slaying of believers, which seemed to be according to law.  “But
Herod laid hold on John and bound him in prison and put him away,” <span
id="fr_5314"></span>[5315](#fn_5314) by this act signifying that, so far
as it depended on his power and on the wickedness of the people, he
bound and imprisoned the prophetic word, and prevented him from
continuing to abide a herald the truth in freedom as formerly.  But this
Herod did for the sake of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.  For
John said unto him, “It is not lawful for thee to have her.” <span
id="fr_5315"></span>[5316](#fn_5315)   Now this Philip was tetrarch of
the region of Ituræa and of Trachonitis.  Some, then, suppose that, when
Philip died leaving a daughter, Herodias, Herod married his brother’s
wife, though the law permitted marriage only when there were no
children.  But, as we find nowhere clear evidence that Philip was dead,
we conclude that a yet greater transgression was done by Herod, namely,
that he had induced his brother’s wife to revolt from her husband while
he was still living.
