<span id="xii.iv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Let Us Do Those Things that
Please God, and Flee from Those He Hates, that We May Be Blessed.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xxx-p2"></span>Seeing, therefore, that we are the
portion of the Holy One, <span id="fr_4141"></span>[4142](#fn_4141) let
us do all those things which pertain to holiness, avoiding all
evil-speaking, all abominable and impure embraces, together with all
drunkenness, seeking after change, <span
id="fr_4142"></span>[4143](#fn_4142) all abominable lusts, detestable
adultery, and execrable pride.  “For God,” \[saith the Scripture\],
“resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.” <span
id="fr_4143"></span>[4144](#fn_4143)   Let us cleave, then, to those to
whom grace has been given by God.  Let us clothe ourselves with concord
and humility, ever exercising self-control, standing far off from all
whispering and evil-speaking, being justified by our works, and not our
words.  For \[the Scripture\] saith, “He that speaketh much, shall also
hear much in answer.  And does he that is ready in speech deem himself
righteous?  Blessed <span id="fr_4144"></span>[4145](#fn_4144) is he
that is born of woman, who liveth but a short time:  be not given to
much speaking.” <span id="fr_4145"></span>[4146](#fn_4145)   Let our
praise be in God, and not of ourselves; for God hateth those that
commend themselves.  Let testimony to our good <span
id="fr_4146"></span>[4147](#fn_4146) deeds be borne by others, as it was
in the case of our righteous forefathers.  Boldness, and arrogance, and
audacity belong to <span id="fr_4147"></span>[4148](#fn_4147) those that
are accursed of God; but moderation, humility, and meekness to such as
are blessed by Him.
