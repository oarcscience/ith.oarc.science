<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>33.  Interpretation of “Tasting of
Death.”</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxiii-p2"></span>But we must seek to understand what
is meant by “tasting of death.”  And He is life who says, “I am the
life,” <span id="fr_5763"></span>[5764](#fn_5763.md) and this life
assuredly has been hidden with Christ in God; and. “when Christ our life
shall be manifested, then along with Him” <span
id="fr_5764"></span>[5765](#fn_5764.md) shall be manifested those who are
worthy of being manifested with Him in glory.  But the enemy of this
life, who is also the last enemy of all His enemies that shall be
destroyed, is death, <span id="fr_5765"></span>[5766](#fn_5765.md) of which
the soul that sinneth dies, having the opposite disposition to that
which takes place in the soul that lives uprightly, and in consequence
of living uprightly lives.  And when it is said in the law, “I have
placed life before thy face,” <span id="fr_5766"></span>[5767](#fn_5766.md)
the Scripture says this about Him who said, “I am the Life,” and about
His enemy, death; the one or other of which each of us by his deeds is
always choosing.  And when we sin with life before our face, the curse
is fulfilled against us which says, “And thy life shall be hanging up
before thee,” etc., down to the words, “and for the sights of thine eyes
which thou shalt see.” <span id="fr_5767"></span>[5768](#fn_5767.md)   As,
therefore, the Life is also the living bread which came down from heaven
and gave life to the world, <span id="fr_5768"></span>[5769](#fn_5768.md)
so His enemy death is dead bread.  Now every rational soul is fed either
on living bread or dead bread, by the opinions good or bad which it
receives.  As then in the case of more common foods it is the practice
at one time only to taste them, and at another to eat of them more
largely; so also, in the case of these loaves, one eats insufficiently
only tasting them, but another is satiated,—he that is good or is on the
way to being good with the living bread which came down from heaven, but
he that is wicked with the dead bread, which is death; and some perhaps
sparingly, and sinning a little, only taste of death; but those who have
attained to virtue do not even taste of it, but are <span
id="page_468">p. 468</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxxiii-Page_468"></span>always fed on the living bread.  It
naturally followed then in the case of Peter, against whom the gates of
Hades will not prevail, that he did not taste of death, since any one
tastes of death and eats death at the time when the gates of Hades
prevail against him; and one eats or tastes of death in proportion as
the gates of Hades to a greater or less extent, more or fewer in number,
prevail against him.  But also for the sons of thunder who were begotten
of thunder, which is a heavenly thing, it was impossible to taste of
death, which is extremely far removed from thunder, their mother.  But
these things the Word prophesies to those who shall be perfected, and
who by standing with the Word advanced so far that they did not taste of
death, until they saw the manifestation and the glory and the kingdom
and the excellency of the Word of God in virtue of which He excels every
word, which by an appearance of truth draws away and drags about those
who are not able to break through the bonds of distraction, and go up to
the height of the excellency of the Word of truth.
