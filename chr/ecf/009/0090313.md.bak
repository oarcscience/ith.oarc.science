<span id="xv.iii.v.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>37.  Of the Effects of the Death of
Christ, of His Triumph After It, and of the Removal by His Death of the
Sins of Men.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxxvii-p2"></span>We have lingered over this subject
of the martyrs and over the record of those who died on account of
pestilence, because this lets us see the excellence of Him who was led
as a sheep to the slaughter and was dumb as a lamb before the shearer. 
For if there is any point in these stories of the Greeks, and if what we
have said of the martyrs is well founded,—the Apostles, too, were for
the same reason the filth of the world and the offscouring of all
things, <span id="fr_4968"></span>[4969](#fn_4968.md) —what and how great
things must be said of the Lamb of God, who was sacrificed for this very
reason, that He might take away the sin not of a few but of the whole
world, for the sake of which also He suffered?  If any one sin, we
read, <span id="fr_4969"></span>[4970](#fn_4969.md) “We have an advocate
with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and He is the propitiation
for our sins, and not for ours only, but for those of the whole world,”
since He is the Saviour of all men, <span
id="fr_4970"></span>[4971](#fn_4970.md) especially of them that believe,
who <span id="fr_4971"></span>[4972](#fn_4971.md) blotted out the written
bond that was against us by His own blood, and took it out of the way,
so that not even a trace, not even of our blotted-out sins, might still
be found, and nailed it to His cross; who having put off from Himself
the principalities and powers, made a show of them openly, triumphing
over them by His cross.  And we are taught to rejoice when we suffer
afflictions in the world, knowing the ground of our rejoicing to be
this, that the world has been conquered and has manifestly been
subjected to its conqueror.  Hence all the nations, released from their
former rulers, serve Him, because He <span
id="fr_4972"></span>[4973](#fn_4972.md) saved the poor from his tyrant by
His own passion, and the needy who had no helper.  This Saviour, then,
having humbled the calumniator by humbling Himself, abides with the
visible sun before His illustrious church, tropically called the moon,
from generation to generation.  And having by His passion destroyed His
enemies, He who is strong in battle and a mighty Lord <span
id="fr_4973"></span>[4974](#fn_4973.md) required after His mighty deeds a
purification which could only be given Him by His Father alone; and this
is why He forbids Mary to touch Him, saying, <span
id="fr_4974"></span>[4975](#fn_4974.md) “Touch Me not, for I am not yet
ascended to My Father; but go and tell My disciples, I go to My Father
and your Father, to My God and your God.”  And when He comes, loaded
with victory and with trophies, with His body which has risen from the
dead,—for what other meaning can we see in the words, “I am not yet
ascended to My Father,” and “I go unto My Father,”—then there are
certain powers which say, Who is this that cometh from Edom, red
garments from Bosor; this that is beautiful? <span
id="fr_4975"></span>[4976](#fn_4975.md)   Then those who escort Him say to
those that are upon the heavenly gates, <span
id="fr_4976"></span>[4977](#fn_4976.md) “Lift up your gates, ye rulers, and
be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, and the king of glory shall come
in.”  But they ask again, seeing as it were His right hand red with
blood and His whole person covered with the marks of His valour, “Why
are Thy garments red, and Thy clothes like the treading of the full
winefat when it is trodden?”  And to this He answers, “I have crushed
them.”  For this cause He had need to wash “His robe in wine, and His
garment in the blood of the grape.” <span
id="fr_4977"></span>[4978](#fn_4977.md)   For when He had taken up our
<span id="page_379">p. 379</span> <span
id="xv.iii.v.xxxvii-Page_379"></span>infirmities and carried our
diseases, and had borne the sin of the whole world, and had conferred
blessings on so many, then, perhaps, He received that baptism which is
greater than any that could ever be conceived among men, and of which I
think He speaks when He says, <span id="fr_4978"></span>[4979](#fn_4978.md)
“I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened till it
be accomplished?”  I enquire here with boldness and I challenge the
ideas put forward by most writers.  They say that the greatest baptism,
beyond which no greater can be conceived, is His passion.  But if this
be so, why should He say to Mary after it, “Touch Me not”?  He should
rather have offered Himself to her touch, when by His passion He had
received His perfect baptism.  But if it was the case, as we said
before, that after all His deeds of valour done against His enemies, He
had need to wash “His robe in wine, His garment in the blood of the
grape,” then He was on His way up to the husbandman of the true vine,
the Father, so that having washed there and after having gone up on
high, He might lead captivity captive and come down bearing manifold
gifts—the tongues, as of fire, which were divided to the Apostles, and
the holy angels which are to be present with them in each action and to
deliver them.  For before these economies they were not yet cleansed and
angels could not dwell with them, for they too perhaps do not desire to
be with those who have not prepared themselves nor been cleansed by
Jesus.  For it was of Jesus’ benignity alone that He ate and drank with
publicans and sinners, and suffered the penitent woman who was a sinner
to wash His feet with her tears, and went down even to death for the
ungodly, counting it not robbery to be equal with God, and emptied
Himself, assuming the form of a servant.  And in accomplishing all this
He fulfils rather the will of the Father who gave Him up for sinners
than His own.  For the Father is good, but the Saviour is the image of
His goodness; and doing good to the world in all things, since God was
in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, which formerly for its
wickedness was all enemy to Him, He accomplishes His good deeds in order
and succession, and does not all at once take all His enemies for His
footstool.  For the Father says to Him, to the Lord of us all, <span
id="fr_4979"></span>[4980](#fn_4979.md) “Sit Thou on My right hand, until I
make Thy enemies the footstool of Thy feet.”  And this goes on till the
last enemy, Death, is overcome by Him.  And if we consider what is meant
by this subjection to Christ and find an explanation of this mainly from
the saying, <span id="fr_4980"></span>[4981](#fn_4980.md) “When all things
shall have been put under Him, then shall the Son Himself be subjected
to Him who put all things under Him,” then we shall see how the
conception agrees with the goodness of the God of all, since it is that
of the Lamb of God, taking away the sin of the world.  Not all men’s
sin, however, is taken away by the Lamb of God, not the sin of those who
do not grieve and suffer affliction till it be taken away.  For thorns
are not only fixed but deeply rooted in the hand of every one who is
intoxicated by wickedness and has parted with sobriety, as it is said in
the Proverbs, <span id="fr_4981"></span>[4982](#fn_4981.md) “Thorns grow in
the hand of the drunkard,” and what pain they must cause him who has
admitted such growth in the substance of his soul, it is hard even to
tell.  Who has allowed wickedness to establish itself so deeply in his
soul as to be a ground full of thorns, he must be cut down by the quick
and powerful word of God, which is sharper than a two-edged sword, and
which is more caustic than any fire.  To such a soul that fire must be
sent which finds out thorns, and by its divine virtue stands where they
are and does not also burn up the threshing-floors or standing corn. 
But of the Lamb which takes away the sin of the world and begins to do
so by His own death there are several ways, some of which are capable of
being clearly understood by most, but others are concealed from most,
and are known to those only who are worthy of divine wisdom.  Why should
we count up all the ways by which we come to believe among men?  That is
a thing which every one living in the body is able to see for himself. 
And in the ways in which we believe in these also, sin is taken away; by
afflictions and evil spirits and dangerous diseases and grievous
sicknesses.  And who knows what follows after this?  So much as we have
said was not unnecessary—we could not neglect the thought which is so
clearly connected with that of the words, “Behold the Lamb of God that
taketh away the sin of the world,” and had therefore to attend somewhat
closely to this part of our subject.  This has brought us to see that
God convicts some by His wrath and chastens them by His anger, since His
love to men is so great that He will not leave any without conviction
and chastening; so that we should do what in us lies to be spared such
<span id="page_380">p. 380</span> <span
id="xv.iii.v.xxxvii-Page_380"></span>conviction and such chastening by
the sorest trials.
