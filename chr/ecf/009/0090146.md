<span id="xii.iv.li-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter LI.—Let the Partakers in Strife
Acknowledge Their Sins.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.li-p2"></span>Let us therefore implore forgiveness for
all those transgressions which through any \[suggestion\] of the
adversary we have committed.  And these who have been the leaders of
sedition and disagreement ought to have respect <span
id="fr_4272"></span>[4273](#fn_4272) to the common hope.  For such as
live in fear and love would rather that they themselves than their
neighbours should be involved in suffering.  And they prefer to bear
blame themselves, rather than that the concord which has been well and
piously <span id="fr_4273"></span>[4274](#fn_4273) handed down to us
should suffer.  For it is better that a man should acknowledge his
transgressions than that he should harden his heart, as the hearts of
those were hardened who stirred up sedition against Moses the
servant <span id="fr_4274"></span>[4275](#fn_4274) of God, and whose
condemnation was made manifest \[unto all\].  For they went down alive
into Hades, and death swallowed them up. <span
id="fr_4275"></span>[4276](#fn_4275)   Pharaoh with his army and all the
princes of Egypt, and the chariots with their riders, were sunk in the
depths of the Red Sea, and perished, <span
id="fr_4276"></span>[4277](#fn_4276) for no other reason than that their
foolish hearts were hardened, after so many signs and wonders had been
wrought in the land of Egypt by Moses the servant of God.
