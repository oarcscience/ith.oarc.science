<span id="xv.iii.i.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxv-p1.1"></span>25.  Christ as the Resurrection.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxv-p2"></span>Now He is called the light of men and
the true light and the light of the word, because He brightens and
irradiates the higher parts of men, or, in a word, of all reasonable
beings.  And similarly it is from and because of the energy with which
He causes the old deadness to be put aside and that which is *par
excellence* life to be put on, so that those who have truly received Him
rise again from the dead, that He is called the resurrection.  And this
He does not only at the moment at which a man says, <span
id="fr_4592"></span>[4593](#fn_4592.md) “We are buried with Christ through
baptism and have risen again with Him,” but much rather when a man,
having laid off all about him that belongs to death, walks in the
newness of life which belongs to Him, the Son, while here.  We
always <span id="fr_4593"></span>[4594](#fn_4593.md) “carry about in our
body the dying of the Lord Jesus,” and thus we reap the vast advantage,
“that the life of the Lord Jesus might be made manifest in our bodies.”
