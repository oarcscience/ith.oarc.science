<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>14.  How Jesus Finished His
Words.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xiv-p2"></span>“*And it came to pass when Jesus had
finished these words.*” <span id="fr_6142"></span>[6143](#fn_6142)   He
who gives a detailed and complete account of each of the questions
before him so that nothing is left out, finishes his own words.  But he
will give a declaration on this point with more confidence who devotes
himself with great diligence to the entire reading of the Old and New
Testament; for if the expression, “he finished these words,” may be
applied to no other, neither to Moses, nor to any of the prophets, but
only to Jesus, then one would dare to say that Jesus alone finished His
words, He who came to put an end to things, and to fulfil what was
defective in the law, by saying, “It was said to them of old
time,” <span id="fr_6143"></span>[6144](#fn_6143) etc., and, again,
“That the things spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled.” <span
id="fr_6144"></span>[6145](#fn_6144)   But if it is written somewhere
also in them, then you may compare and contrast the discourses finished
by them with those finished by the Saviour, that you may find the
difference between them.  And yet at this point, also, investigation
might be made whether in the case of the things spoken by way of oracle
the expression, “he finished,” is applied either to the things spoken by
Moses, or any of the prophets, or of both together; for careful
observation would suggest very weighty thoughts to those who know how
“to compare spiritual things with spiritual,” and on this account “speak
not in words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit
teacheth.” <span id="fr_6145"></span>[6146](#fn_6145)   But perhaps some
other one, attending with over-curious spirit to the word “finished,”
which is assigned to things of a more mystical order, just as we say
that some one delivered to those who were under his control mysteries
and rites of “perfecting” <span id="fr_6146"></span>[6147](#fn_6146) not
in a praiseworthy fashion, and another delivered the mysteries of God to
those who are worthy, and rites of “perfecting” proportionate to such
mysteries, might say that having initiated them, he made a rite of
“perfecting,” by which “perfecting” the words were shown to be powerful,
so that the gospel of Jesus was preached in the whole world, and by
virtue of the divine “perfecting” gained the mastery of every soul which
the Father draws to the Son, according to what is said by the Saviour,
“No one comes to Me except the Father which has sent Me draw him.” <span
id="fr_6147"></span>[6148](#fn_6147)   Wherefore also “the word” of
those who by the grace of God are ambassadors of the gospel, “and their
preaching, is not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of
the spirit of power,” <span id="fr_6148"></span>[6149](#fn_6148) to
those for whom the words of the doctrine of Jesus were finished.  You
will therefore observe how often it is said, “He finished,” and of what
things it is said, and you will take as an illustration that which is
said in regard to the beatitudes, and the whole of <span
id="page_505">p. 505</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xiv-Page_505"></span>the discourse to which is subjoined,
“And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words, all the
multitudes were astonished at His teaching.” <span
id="fr_6149"></span>[6150](#fn_6149)   But now the saying, “Jesus
finished these words,” is referred also immediately to the very mystical
parable according to which the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a king,
but also beyond this parable to the sections which were written before
it.

became perfect; and in later Christian usage it was applied to the
