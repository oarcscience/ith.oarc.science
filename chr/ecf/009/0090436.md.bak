<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxxix-p1.1"></span>39.  Jesus Was Transfigured—“As He Was
Praying.”</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxix-p2"></span>Then, since it will be necessary to
expound the passage as given in Mark, “*And as He was praying He was
transfigured before them,*” <span id="fr_5787"></span>[5788](#fn_5787.md)
we must say that perhaps it is possible especially to see the Word
transfigured before us if we have done the things aforesaid, and gone up
into the mountain, and seen the absolute Word holding converse with the
Father, and praying to Him for such things as the true High-Priest might
pray for to the only true God.  But in order that He may thus hold
fellowship with God and pray to the Father, He goes up into the
mountain; and then, according to Mark, “His garments become white and
glistening as the light, so as no fuller on earth can whiten
them.” <span id="fr_5788"></span>[5789](#fn_5788.md)   And perhaps the
fullers <span id="page_471">p. 471</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxxix-Page_471"></span>upon the earth are the wise men of
this world who are careful about the diction which they consider to be
bright and pure, so that even their base thoughts and false dogmas seem
to be beautified by their fulling, so to speak; but He who shows His own
garments glistering to those who have ascended and brighter than their
fulling can make them, is the Word, who exhibits in the expressions of
the Scriptures which are despised by many the glistering of the
thoughts, when the raiment of Jesus, according to Luke, becomes white
and dazzling. <span id="fr_5789"></span>[5790](#fn_5789.md)
