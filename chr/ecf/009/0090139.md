<span id="xii.iv.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIV.—The Ordinances of the
Apostles, that There Might Be No Contention Respecting the Priestly
Office.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xliv-p2"></span>Our apostles also knew, through our
Lord Jesus Christ, that there would be strife on account of the
office <span id="fr_4231"></span>[4232](#fn_4231) of the episcopate. 
For this reason, therefore, inasmuch as they had obtained a perfect
fore-knowledge of this, they appointed those \[ministers\] already
mentioned, and afterwards gave instructions, <span
id="fr_4232"></span>[4233](#fn_4232) that when these should fall asleep,
other approved men should succeed them in their ministry.  We are of
opinion, therefore, that those appointed by them, <span
id="fr_4233"></span>[4234](#fn_4233) or afterwards by other eminent men,
with the consent of the whole church, and who have blamelessly served
the flock of Christ, in a humble, peaceable, and disinterested spirit,
and have for a long time possessed the good opinion of all, cannot be
justly dismissed from the ministry.  For our sin will not be small, if
we eject from the episcopate <span id="fr_4234"></span>[4235](#fn_4234)
those who have blamelessly and holily fulfilled its duties. <span
id="fr_4235"></span>[4236](#fn_4235)   Blessed are those presbyters who,
having finished their course before now, have obtained a fruitful and
perfect departure \[from this world\]; for they have no fear lest any
one deprive them of the place now appointed them.  But we see that ye
have removed some men of excellent behaviour from the ministry, which
they fulfilled blamelessly and with honour.

<span id="fn_4231"></span>[242:4232](0090139.htm#fr_4231) <span
id="xii.iv.xliv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iv.xliv-p3"></span> Literally, “on account of the title of
the oversight ”  Some understand this to mean, “in regard to the dignity
of the episcopate;” and others simply, “on account of the oversight.” 
I. for <span class="Greek"><span
id="xii.iv.xliv-p3.1"></span>ἐπινομή</span> gives <span
class="Greek"><span id="xii.iv.xliv-p3.2"></span>ἐπιδομή</span>  
Bryennius conjectures <span class="Greek"><span
id="xii.iv.xliv-p3.3"></span>ἐπιδοχή</span>, which perhaps, may be
rendered “Succession” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xii.iv.xliv-p3.4"></span>διαδοχή</span>).

<span id="fn_4232"></span>[242:4233](0090139.htm#fr_4232) <span
id="xii.iv.xliv-p3.5"></span>

<span id="xii.iv.xliv-p4"></span> The meaning of this passage is much
controverted.  Some render, “left a list of other approved persons;”
while others translate the unusual word <span class="Greek"><span
id="xii.iv.xliv-p4.1"></span>έπινομὴ</span>, which causes the
difficulty, by “testamentary direction,” and many others deem the text
corrupt.  We have given what seems the simplest version of the text as
it stands.

<span id="fn_4233"></span>[242:4234](0090139.htm#fr_4233) <span
id="xii.iv.xliv-p4.2"></span>

<span id="xii.iv.xliv-p5"></span> *i.e.* the apostles.

<span id="fn_4234"></span>[242:4235](0090139.htm#fr_4234) <span
id="xii.iv.xliv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iv.xliv-p6"></span> Or, “oversight.”

<span id="fn_4235"></span>[242:4236](0090139.htm#fr_4235) <span
id="xii.iv.xliv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iv.xliv-p7"></span> Literally, “presented the offerings.”
