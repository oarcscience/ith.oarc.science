<span id="xv.iii.v.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.xxxii-p1.1"></span>32.  John Calls Jesus a “Lamb.”  Why
Does He Name This Animal Specially?  Of the Typology of the Sacrifices,
Generally.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxxii-p2"></span>“And he sayeth, Behold the Lamb of
God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” <span
id="fr_4953"></span>[4954](#fn_4953)   There were five animals which
were brought to the altar, three that walk and two that fly; and it
seems to be worth asking why John calls the Saviour a lamb and not any
of these other creatures, and why, when each of the animals that walk is
offered of three kinds he used for the sheep-kind the term “lamb.”  The
five animals are as follows:  the bullock, the sheep, the goat, the
turtle-dove, the pigeon.  And of the walking animals these are the three
kinds—bullock, ox, calf; ram, sheep, lamb; he-goat, goat, kid.  Of the
flying animals, of pigeons we only hear of two young ones; of turtle
doves only of a pair.  He, then, who would accurately understand the
spiritual rationale of the sacrifices must enquire of what heavenly
things these were the pattern and the shadow, and also for what end the
sacrifice of each victim is prescribed, and he must specially collect
the points connected with the lamb.  Now that the principle of the
sacrifice must be apprehended with reference to certain heavenly
mysteries, appears from the words of the Apostle, who somewhere <span
id="fr_4954"></span>[4955](#fn_4954) says, “Who serve a pattern and
shadow of heavenly things,” and again, “It was necessary that the
patterns of the things in the heavens should be purified with these, but
the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.”  Now
to find out all the particulars of these and to state in its relation to
them that sacrifice of the spiritual law which took place in Jesus
Christ (a truth greater than human nature can comprehend)—to do this
belongs to no other than the perfect man, <span
id="fr_4955"></span>[4956](#fn_4955) who, by reason of use, has his
senses exercised to discern good and evil, and who is able to say, from
a truth-loving disposition, <span id="fr_4956"></span>[4957](#fn_4956)
“We speak wisdom among them that are perfect.”  Of these things truly
and things like these, we can say, <span
id="fr_4957"></span>[4958](#fn_4957) “Which none of the rulers of this
world knew.”
