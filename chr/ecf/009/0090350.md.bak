id="xvi.ii.ii-Page_413"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xvi.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>From the Second Book of the Commentary on the
Gospel According to Matthew.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.ii-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xvi.ii.ii-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xvi.ii.ii-p3.1"></span>Book II. <span

<span id="xvi.ii.ii-p5"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.ii-p5.1"></span>The Unity and Harmony of Scripture.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.ii-p6"></span>“*Blessed are the peacemakers*.…” <span
id="fr_5153"></span>[5154](#fn_5153.md)   To the man who is a peacemaker in
either sense there is in the Divine oracles nothing crooked or perverse,
for they are all plain to those who understand. <span
id="fr_5154"></span>[5155](#fn_5154.md)   And because to such an one there
is nothing crooked or perverse, he sees therefore abundance of
peace <span id="fr_5155"></span>[5156](#fn_5155.md) in all the Scriptures,
even in those which seem to be at conflict, and in contradiction with
one another.  And likewise he becomes a third peacemaker as he
demonstrates that that which appears to others to be a conflict in the
Scriptures is no conflict, and exhibits their concord and peace, whether
of the Old Scriptures with the New, or of the Law with the Prophets, or
of the Gospels with the Apostolic Scriptures, or of the Apostolic
Scriptures with each other.  For, also, according to the Preacher, all
the Scriptures are “words of the wise like goads, and as nails firmly
fixed which were given by agreement from one shepherd;” <span
id="fr_5156"></span>[5157](#fn_5156.md) and there is nothing superfluous in
them.  But the Word is the one Shepherd of things rational which may
have an appearance of discord to those who have not ears to hear, but
are truly at perfect concord.  For as the different chords of the
psalter or the lyre, each of which gives forth a certain sound of its
own which seems unlike the sound of another chord, are thought by a man
who is not musical and ignorant of the principle of musical harmony, to
be inharmonious, because of the dissimilarity of the sounds, so those
who are not skilled in hearing the harmony of God in the sacred
Scriptures think that the Old is not in harmony with the New, or the
Prophets with the Law, or the Gospels with one another, or the Apostle
with the Gospel, or with himself, or with the other Apostles.  But he
who comes instructed in the music of God, being a man wise in word and
deed, and, on this account, like another David—which is, by
interpretation, skilful with the hand—will bring out the sound of the
music of God, having learned from this at the right time to strike the
chords, now the chords of the Law, now the Gospel chords in harmony with
them, and again the Prophetic chords, and, when reason demands it, the
Apostolic chords which are in harmony with the Prophetic, and likewise
the Apostolic with those of the Gospels.  For he knows that all the
Scripture is the one perfect and harmonised <span
id="fr_5157"></span>[5158](#fn_5157.md) instrument of God, which from
different sounds gives forth one saving voice to those willing to learn,
which stops and restrains every working of an evil spirit, just as the
music of David laid to rest the evil spirit in Saul, which also was
choking him. <span id="fr_5158"></span>[5159](#fn_5158.md)   You see, then,
that he is in the third place a peacemaker, who sees in accordance with
the Scripture the peace of it all, and implants this peace in those who
rightly seek and make nice distinctions in a genuine spirit.
