<span id="xv.iii.i.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.viii-p1.1"></span>8.  How the Gospels Cause the Other Books
of Scripture Also to Be Gospel.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.viii-p2"></span>Now an objection might be raised to
our first definition, because it would embrace books which are not
entitled Gospels.  For the law and the prophets also are to our eyes
books containing the promise of things which, from the benefit they will
confer on him, naturally rejoice the hearer as soon as he takes in the
message.  To this it may be said that before the sojourn of Christ, the
law and the prophets, since He had not come who interpreted the
mysteries they contained, did not convey such a promise as belongs to
our definition of the Gospel; but the Saviour, when He sojourned with
men and caused the Gospel to appear in bodily form, by the Gospel caused
all things to appear as Gospel.  Here I would not think it beside the
purpose to quote the example of Him who…a few things…and yet all. <span
id="fr_4491"></span>[4492](#fn_4491.md)   For when he had taken away the
veil which was present in the law and the prophets, and by His divinity
had proved the sons of men that the Godhead was at work, He opened the
way for all those who desired it to be disciples of His wisdom, and to
understand what things were true and real in the law of Moses, of which
things those of old worshipped the type and the shadow, and what things
were real of the things narrated in the histories which “happened to
them in the way of type,” <span id="fr_4492"></span>[4493](#fn_4492.md) but
these things “were written for our sakes, upon whom the ends of the ages
have come.”  With whomsoever, then, Christ has sojourned, he worships
God neither at Jerusalem nor on the mountain of the Samaritans; he knows
that God is a spirit, and worships Him spiritually, in spirit and in
truth; no longer by type does he worship the Father and Maker of all. 
Before that Gospel, therefore, which came into being by the sojourning
of Christ, none of the older works was a Gospel.  But the Gospel, which
is the new covenant, having delivered us from the oldness of the letter,
lights up for us, by the light of knowledge, <span
id="fr_4493"></span>[4494](#fn_4493.md) the newness of the spirit, a thing
which never grows old, which has its home in the New Testament, but is
also present in all the Scriptures.  It was fitting, therefore, that
that Gospel, which enables us to find the Gospel present, even in the
Old Testament, should itself receive, in a special sense, the name of
Gospel.
