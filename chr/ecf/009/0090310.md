id="xv.iii.v.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>34.  The Morning and Evening Sacrifices
of the Saint in His Life of Thought.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxxiv-p2"></span>But if any one asks what the saint
is to do in the time between morning and evening, let him follow what
takes place in the cultus and infer from it the principle he asks for. 
In that case the priests begin their offerings with the continual
sacrifice, and before they come to the continuous one of the evening
they offer the other sacrifices which the law prescribes, as, for
example, that for transgression, or that for involuntary offences, or
that connected with a prayer for salvation, or that of jealousy, or that
of the Sabbath, or of the new moon, and so on, which it would take too
long to mention.  So we, beginning our oblation with the discourse of
that type which is Christ, can go on to discourse about many other most
useful things.  And drawing to a close still in the things of Christ, we
come, as it were, to evening and night, when we arrive at the bodily
features of His manifestation.
