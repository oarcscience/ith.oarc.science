<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xix-p1.1"></span>19.  The Divorce of Israel.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xix-p2"></span>Now, keeping in mind what we said
above in regard to the passage from Isaiah about the bill of
divorcement, we will say that the mother of the people separated herself
from Christ, her husband, without having received the bill of
divorcement, but afterwards when there was found in her an unseemly
thing, and she did not find favour in his sight, the bill of divorcement
was written out for her; for when the new covenant called those of the
Gentiles to the house of Him who had cast away his former wife, it
virtually gave the bill of divorcement to her who formerly separated
from her husband—the law, and the Word.  Therefore he, also, having
separated from her, married, so to speak, another, having given into the
hands of the former the bill of divorcement; wherefore they can no
longer do the things enjoined on them by the law, because of the bill of
divorcement.  And a sign that she has received the bill of divorcement
is this, that Jerusalem was destroyed along with what they called the
sanctuary of the things in it which were believed to be holy, and with
the altar of burnt offerings, and all the worship associated with it. 
And a further sign of the bill of divorcement is this, that they cannot
keep their feasts, even though according to the <span id="page_508">p.
508</span> <span id="xvi.ii.vii.xix-Page_508"></span>letter of the law
designedly commanded them, in the place which the Lord God appointed to
them for keeping feasts; but there is this also, that the whole
synagogue has become unable to stone those who have committed this or
that sin; and thousands of things commanded are a sign of the bill of
divorcement; and the fact that “there is no more a prophet,” and that
they say, “We no longer see signs;” <span
id="fr_6189"></span>[6190](#fn_6189.md) for the Lord says, “He hath taken
away from Judæa and from Jerusalem,” according to the word of Isaiah,
“Him that is mighty, and her that is mighty, a powerful giant,” etc.,
down to the words, “a prudent hearer.” <span
id="fr_6190"></span>[6191](#fn_6190.md)   Now, He who is the Christ may
have taken the synagogue to wife and cohabited with her, but it may be
that afterwards she found not favour in His sight; and the reason of her
not having found favour in His sight was, that there was found in her an
unseemly thing; for what was more unseemly than the circumstance that,
when it was proposed to them to release one at the feast, they asked for
the release of Barabbas the robber, and the condemnation of Jesus? <span
id="fr_6191"></span>[6192](#fn_6191.md)   And what was more unseemly than
the fact, that they all said in His case, “Crucify Him, crucify Him,”
and “Away with such a fellow from the earth”? <span
id="fr_6192"></span>[6193](#fn_6192.md)   And can this be freed from the
charge of unseemliness, “His blood be upon us, and upon our
children”? <span id="fr_6193"></span>[6194](#fn_6193.md)   Wherefore, when
He was avenged, Jerusalem was compassed with armies, and its desolation
was near, <span id="fr_6194"></span>[6195](#fn_6194.md) and their house was
taken away from it, and “the daughter of Zion was left as a booth in a
vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a besieged
city.” <span id="fr_6195"></span>[6196](#fn_6195.md)   And, about the same
time, I think, the husband wrote out a bill of divorcement to his former
wife, and gave it into her hands, and sent her away from his own house,
and the bond of her who came from the Gentiles has been cancelled about
which the Apostle says, “Having blotted out the bond written in
ordinances, which was contrary to us, and He hath taken it out of the
way, nailing it to the cross;” <span
id="fr_6196"></span>[6197](#fn_6196.md) for Paul also and others became
proselytes of Israel for her who came from the Gentiles. <span
id="fr_6197"></span>[6198](#fn_6197.md)   The first wife, accordingly, not
having found favour before her husband, because in her had been found an
unseemly thing, went out from the dwelling of her husband, and, going
away, has become joined to another man, to whom she has subjected
herself, whether we should call the husband Barabbas the robber, who is
figuratively the devil, or some evil power.  And in the case of some of
that synagogue there has happened the former thing which was written in
the law, but in the case of others, that which was second.  For the last
husband <span id="fr_6198"></span>[6199](#fn_6198.md) hated his wife and
will write out for her some day at the consummation of things a bill of
divorcement, when God so orders it, and will give it into her hands and
will send her away from his dwelling; for as the good God will put
enmity between the serpent and the woman, and between his seed and her
seed, <span id="fr_6199"></span>[6200](#fn_6199.md) so will He order it
that the last husband shall hate her.
