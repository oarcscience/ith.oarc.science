id="xvi.ii.v.xxvi-p1.1"></span>26.  The Less of Life; And the Saving of
It.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxvi-p2"></span>“*For whosoever would save his own
life shall lose it.*” <span id="fr_5727"></span>[5728](#fn_5727.md)   The
first expression is ambiguous; for it may be understood in one way
thus.  If any one as being a lover of life, and thinking that the
present life is good, tends carefully his own life with a view to living
in the flesh, being afraid to die, as through death going to lose it,
this man, by the very willing to save in this way his own life will lose
it, placing it outside of the borders of blessedness.  But if any one
despising the present life because of my word, which has persuaded him
to strive in regard to eternal life even unto death for truth, loses his
own life, surrendering it for the sake of piety to that which is
commonly called death, this man, as for my sake he has lost his life,
will save it rather, and keep it in possession.  And according to a
second way we might interpret the saying as follows.  If any one, who
has grasped what salvation really is, wishes to procure the salvation of
his own life, let this man having taken farewell of this life, and
denied himself and taken up his own cross, and following me, lose his
own life to the world; for having lost it for my sake and for the sake
of all my teaching, he will gain the end of loss of this kind—salvation.
