<span id="xvi.ii.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>9.  Christ the Pearl of Great
Price.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.ix-p2"></span>Now you will connect with the man
seeking goodly pearls the saying, “Seek and ye shall find,” <span
id="fr_5193"></span>[5194](#fn_5193) and this—“Every one that seeketh
findeth.” <span id="fr_5194"></span>[5195](#fn_5194)   For what seek
ye?  Or what does every one that seeketh find?  I venture to answer,
pearls and the pearl which he possesses, who has given up all things,
and counted them as loss; “for which,” says Paul, “I have counted all
things but loss that I may win Christ;” <span
id="fr_5195"></span>[5196](#fn_5195) by “all things” meaning the goodly
pearls, “that I may win Christ,” the one very precious pearl.  Precious,
then, is a lamp to men in darkness, and there is need of a lamp until
the sun rise; and precious also is the glory in the face of Moses, and
of the prophets also, I think, and a beautiful sight, by which we are
introduced so as to be able to see the glory of Christ, to which the
Father bears witness, saying, “This is My beloved Son in whom I am
well-pleased.” <span id="fr_5196"></span>[5197](#fn_5196)   But “that
which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this
respect by reason of the glory that surpasseth;” <span
id="fr_5197"></span>[5198](#fn_5197) and there is need to us first of
the glory which admits of being done away, for the sake of the glory
which surpasseth; as there is need of the knowledge which is in part,
which will be done away when that which is perfect comes. <span
id="fr_5198"></span>[5199](#fn_5198)   Every soul, therefore, which
comes to childhood, and is on the way to full growth, until the fulness
of time is at hand, needs a tutor and stewards and guardians, in order
that, after all these things, he who formerly differed nothing from a
bond-servant, though he is lord of all, <span
id="fr_5199"></span>[5200](#fn_5199) may receive, when freed from a
tutor and stewards and guardians, the patrimony corresponding to the
very costly pearl, and to that which is perfect, which on its coming
does away with that which is in part, when one is able to receive “the
excellency of the knowledge of Christ,” <span
id="fr_5200"></span>[5201](#fn_5200) having been previously exercised,
so to speak, in those forms of knowledge which are surpassed by the
knowledge of Christ.  But the multitude, not perceiving the beauty of
the many pearls of the law, and all the knowledge, “in part,” though it
be, of the prophets, suppose that they can, without a clear exposition
and apprehension of these, find in whole <span
id="fr_5201"></span>[5202](#fn_5201) the one precious pearl, and behold
“the excellency of the knowledge of Christ,” in comparison with which
all things that came before such and so great knowledge, although they
were not refuse in their own nature, appear to be refuse.  This refuse
is perhaps the “dung” thrown down beside the fig tree by the keeper of
the vineyard, which is the cause of its bearing fruit. <span
