<span id="xv.iii.i.v"></span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.v-p1"></span> <span id="page_299">p. 299</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.v-Page_299"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.v-p1.1"></span>5.  All Scripture is Gospel; But the Gospels
are Distinguished Above Other Scriptures.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.v-p2"></span>Here, however, some one may object,
appealing to the notion just put forward of the unfolding of the first
fruits last, and may say that the Acts and the letters of the Apostles
came after the Gospels, and that this destroys our argument to the
effect that the Gospel is the first fruits of all Scripture.  To this we
must reply that it is the conviction of men who are wise in Christ, who
have profited by those epistles which are current, and who see them to
be vouched for by the testimonies deposited in the law and the
prophets, <span id="fr_4464"></span>[4465](#fn_4464.md) that the apostolic
writings are to be pronounced wise and worthy of belief, and that they
have great authority, but that they are not on the same level with that
“Thus sayeth the Lord Almighty.” <span
id="fr_4465"></span>[4466](#fn_4465.md)   Consider on this point the
language of St. Paul.  When he declares that <span
id="fr_4466"></span>[4467](#fn_4466.md) “Every Scripture is inspired of God
and profitable,” does he include his own writings?  Or does he not
include his dictum, <span id="fr_4467"></span>[4468](#fn_4467.md) “I say,
and not the Lord,” and <span id="fr_4468"></span>[4469](#fn_4468.md) “So I
ordain in all the churches,” and <span
id="fr_4469"></span>[4470](#fn_4469.md) “What things I suffered at Antioch,
at Iconium, at Lystra,” and similar things which he writes in virtue of
his own authority, and which do not quite possess the character of words
flowing from divine inspiration.  Must we also show that the old
Scripture is not Gospel, since it does not point out the Coming One, but
only foretells Him and heralds His coming at a future time; but that all
the new Scripture is the Gospel.  It not only says as in the beginning
of the Gospel, <span id="fr_4470"></span>[4471](#fn_4470.md) “Behold the
Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world;” it also contains
many praises of Him, and many of His teachings, on whose account the
Gospel is a Gospel.  Again, if God set in the Church <span
id="fr_4471"></span>[4472](#fn_4471.md) apostles and prophets and
evangelists (gospellers), pastors and teachers, we must first enquire
what was the office of the evangelist, and mark that it is not only to
narrate how the Saviour cured a man who was blind from his birth, <span
id="fr_4472"></span>[4473](#fn_4472.md) or raised up a dead man who was
already stinking, <span id="fr_4473"></span>[4474](#fn_4473.md) or to state
what extraordinary works he wrought; and the office of the evangelist
being thus defined, we shall not hesitate to find Gospel in such
discourse also as is not narrative but hortatory and intended to
strengthen belief in the mission of Jesus; and thus we shall arrive at
the position that whatever was written by the Apostles is Gospel.  As to
this second definition, it might be objected that the Epistles are not
entitled “Gospel,” and that we are wrong in applying the name of Gospel
to the whole of the New Testament.  But to this we answer that it
happens not unfrequently in Scripture when two or more persons or things
are named by the same name, the name attaches itself most significantly
to one of those things or persons.  Thus the Saviour says, <span
id="fr_4474"></span>[4475](#fn_4474.md) “Call no man Master upon the
earth;” while the Apostle says that Masters <span
id="fr_4475"></span>[4476](#fn_4475.md) have been appointed in the Church. 
These latter accordingly will not be Masters in the strict sense of the
dictum of the Gospel.  In the same way the Gospel in the Epistles will
not extend to every word of them, when it is compared with the narrative
of Jesus’ actions and sufferings and discourses.  No:  the Gospel is the
first fruits of all Scripture, and to these first fruits of the
Scriptures we devote the first fruits of all those actions of ours which
we trust to see turn out as we desire.
