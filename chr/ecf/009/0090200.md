<span id="xv.iii.i.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.iv-p1.1"></span>4.  The Study of the Gospels is the First
Fruits Offered by These Priests of Christianity.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.iv-p2"></span>Now our whole activity is devoted to
God, and our whole life, since we are bent on progress in divine
things.  If, then, it be our desire to have the whole of those first
fruits spoken of above which are made up of the many first fruits, if we
are not mistaken in this view, in what must our first fruits consist,
after the bodily separation we have undergone from each other, but in
the study of the Gospel?  For we may venture to say that the Gospel is
the first fruits of all the Scriptures.  Where, then, could be the first
fruits of our activity, since the time when we came to Alexandria, but
in the first fruits of the Scriptures?  It must not be forgotten,
however, that the first fruits are not the same as the first growth. 
For the first fruits <span id="fr_4462"></span>[4463](#fn_4462) are
offered after all the fruits (are ripe), but the first growth <span
id="fr_4463"></span>[4464](#fn_4463) before them all.  Now of the
Scriptures which are current and are believed to be divine in all the
churches, one would not be wrong in saying that the first growth is the
law of Moses, but the first fruits the Gospel.  For it was after all the
fruits of the prophets who prophesied till the Lord Jesus, that the
perfect word shot forth.
