begin, with the help of God most high, the writing of the pure gospel,
the blooming garden, called *Diatessaron* (a word meaning “fourfold”),
the work compiled by Titianus the Greek out of the four
evangelists—Matthew the elect, whose symbol is M, Mark the chosen, whose
symbol is R, Luke the approved, whose symbol is K, and John the beloved,
whose symbol is H.  The work was translated from Syriac into Arabic by
the excellent and learned priest Abu’l Faraj ‘Abdulla
ibn-at-Tayyib, <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) may God grant him
his favour.  He began with the first of <span
id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) And he said:  The Beginning <span
id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) of the Gospel of Jesus the Son of the
living God.  John: <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md)   In the
beginning, etc.

Beginning <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) of the Gospel of Jesus

id="iv.ii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p5"></span> The <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii-p5.1"></span>ms.</span> here has *Tabib*, but the name is
correctly given in the Subscription (*q.v*.).

<span id="fn_70"></span>[42:71](0090008.htm#fr_70.md) <span
id="iv.ii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p6"></span> i.e., simply *He began with*.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[42:72](0090008.htm#fr_71.md) <span
id="iv.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p7"></span> The vowel signs as printed by Ciasca imply
some such construction as*And he said as a beginning:  The Gospel*,
etc.  But the vocalisation is of course not authoritative, and a
comparison with the preface in the Vatican <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii-p7.1"></span>ms.</span> suggests the rendering given above. 
The word translated *Beginning* in the two Introductory Notes is the
very word (whichever spelling be adopted) used by Ibn-at-Tayyib himself
in his comments on [Mark i.](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.ii-p7.2"></span> (at least according to the Brit. Mus. <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.ii-p7.3"></span>ms.</span>), although not in the
gospel text prefixed to the Comments *as it now stands*, or indeed in
any <span class="sc"><span id="iv.ii-p7.4"></span>ms.</span> Arabic
gospel in the Brit. Mus.  This would seem to militate against our theory
of the original form of this much-debated passage in the Introductory
Notes, as indicated by the use of small type for the later inserted
phrases; and the difficulty appears at first to be increased by the
following words in Ibn-at-Tayyib’s comments on [Mark
i.](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.ii-p7.5"></span> (Brit.
Mus. <span class="sc"><span id="iv.ii-p7.6"></span>ms.</span>, fol.
190a), and some say that the Greek citation *and in the Diatessaron,
which Tatianus the pupil of Justianus the philosopher wrote, the
quotation is not written*, “Isaiah,” but, “as it is written in the
prophet.”  This is a remarkable statement about the *Diatessaron*.  But
the sentence is hardly grammatical.  Perhaps the words printed in
italics originally formed a complete sentence by themselves, possibly on
the margin.  If this conjecture be correct we might emend, e.g., by
restoring them to the margin, and repeating the last three words or some
equivalent phrase in the text.  It would be interesting to know how the
Paris <span class="sc"><span id="iv.ii-p7.7"></span>ms.</span> reads.

<span id="iv.ii-p8"></span> Ciasca does not state whether the word
*John* occurs here in the Borgian <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii-p8.1"></span>ms</span>. or not.
