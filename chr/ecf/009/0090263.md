<span id="xv.iii.ii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>24.  John the Baptist Was Sent.  From
Where?  His Soul Was Sent from a Higher Region.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xxiv-p2"></span>“There was a man sent from God,
whose name was John.” <span id="fr_4746"></span>[4747](#fn_4746.md)   He
who is sent is sent from somewhere to somewhere; and the careful student
will, therefore, enquire from what quarter John was sent, and whither. 
The “whither” is quite plain on the face of the story; he was sent to
Israel, and to those who were willing to hear him when he was staying in
the wilderness of Judæa and baptizing by the banks of the Jordan. 
According to the deeper sense, however, he was sent into the world, the
world being understood as this earthly place where men are; and the
careful student will have this in view in enquiring from where John was
sent.  Examining the words more closely, he will perhaps declare that as
it is written of Adam, <span id="fr_4747"></span>[4748](#fn_4747.md) “And
the Lord sent him forth out of the Paradise of pleasure to till the
earth, out of which he was taken,” so also John was sent, either from
heaven or from Paradise, or from some other quarter to this place on the
earth.  He was sent that he might bear witness of the light.  There is,
however, an objection to this interpretation, which is not to be lightly
dismissed.  It is written in Isaiah: <span
id="fr_4748"></span>[4749](#fn_4748.md)   “Whom shall I send, and who will
go to the people?”  The prophet answers:  “Here am I,—send me.”  He,
then, who objects to that rendering of <span id="page_340">p. 340</span>
<span id="xv.iii.ii.xxiv-Page_340"></span>our passage which appears to
be the deeper may say that Isaiah was sent not to this world from
another place, but after having seen “the Lord sitting on a throne high
and lifted up,” was sent to the people, to say, “Hearing, ye shall hear
and shall not understand,” and so on; and that in the same manner John,
the beginning of his mission not being narrated, is sent after the
analogy of the mission of Isaiah, to baptize, <span
id="fr_4749"></span>[4750](#fn_4749.md) and to make ready for the Lord a
people prepared for Him, and to bear witness of the light.  So much we
have said of the first sense; and now we adduce certain solutions which
help to confirm the deeper meaning about John.  In the same passage it
is added, “He came for witness, to bear witness of the light.”  Now, if
he came, where did he come from?  To those who find it difficult to
follow us, we point to what John says afterwards of having seen the Holy
Spirit as a dove descending on the Saviour.  “He that sent me,” he
says, <span id="fr_4750"></span>[4751](#fn_4750.md) “to baptize with water,
He said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Holy Spirit
descending and abiding upon Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the
Holy Spirit and with fire.”  When did He send him and give him this
injunction?  The answer to this question will probably be that when He
sent him to begin to baptize, then He who was dealing with him uttered
this word.  But a more convincing argument for the view that John was
sent from another region when he entered into the body, the one object
of his entry into this life being that he should bear witness of the
truth, may be drawn from the narrative of his birth.  Gabriel, when
announcing to Zacharias the birth of John, and to Mary the advent of our
Saviour among men, says: <span id="fr_4751"></span>[4752](#fn_4751.md)  
That John is to be “filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s
womb.”  And we have also the saying, “For behold, when the voice of thy
salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.”  He
who sedulously guards himself in his dealings with Scripture against
forced, or casual, or capricious procedure, must necessarily assume that
John’s soul was older than his body, and subsisted by itself before it
was sent on the ministry of the witness of the light.  Nor must we
overlook the text, “This is Elijah which is to come.” <span
id="fr_4752"></span>[4753](#fn_4752.md)   For if that general doctrine of
the soul is to be received, namely, that it is not sown at the same time
with the body, but is before it, and is then, for various causes,
clothed with flesh and blood; then the words “sent from God” will not
appear to be applicable to John alone.  The most evil of all, the man of
sin, the son of perdition, is said by Paul to be sent by God: <span
id="fr_4753"></span>[4754](#fn_4753.md)   “God sendeth them a working of
error that they should believe a lie; that they all might be judged who
believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.”  But our
present question may, perhaps, be solved in this way, that as every man
is a man of God, simply because God created him, but not every man is
called a man of God, but only he who has devoted himself to God, such as
Elijah and those who are called men of God in the Scriptures, thus every
man might be said in ordinary language to be sent from God, but in the
absolute sense no one is to be spoken of in this way who has not entered
this life for a divine ministry and in the service of the salvation of
mankind.  We do not find it said of any one but the saints that he is
sent by God.  It is said of Isaiah as we showed before; it is also said
of Jeremiah, “To whomsoever I shall send thee thou shalt go”; <span
id="fr_4754"></span>[4755](#fn_4754.md) and it is said of Ezekiel, <span
id="fr_4755"></span>[4756](#fn_4755.md) “I send thee to nations that are
rebellious and have not believed in Me.”  The examples, however, do not
expressly speak of a mission from the region outside life into life, and
as it is a mission into life that we are enquiring about, they may seem
to have little bearing on our subject.  But there is nothing absurd in
our transferring the argument derived from them to our question.  They
tell us that it is only the saints, and we were speaking of them, whom
God is said to send, and in this sense they may be applied to the case
of those who are sent into this life.
