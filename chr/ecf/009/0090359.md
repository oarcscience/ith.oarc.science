<span id="xvi.ii.iii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>8.  The Parable Interpreted is the
Light of These Views.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.viii-p2"></span>Now, having collected these things
out of dissertations about stones, I say that the Saviour with a
knowledge of the difference of pearls, of which some are in kind goodly
and others worthless, said, “The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man
that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls;” <span
id="fr_5189"></span>[5190](#fn_5189) for, if some of the pearls had not
been worthless, it would not have been said, “to a man seeking goodly
pearls.”  Now among the words of all kinds which profess to announce
truth, and among those who report them, he seeks pearls.  And let the
prophets be, so to speak, the mussels which conceive the dew of heaven,
and become pregnant with the word of truth from heaven, the <span
id="page_418">p. 418</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.viii-Page_418"></span>goodly pearls which, according to
the phrase here set forth, the merchantman seeks.  And the leader of the
pearls, on the finding of which the rest are found with it, is the very
costly pearl, the Christ of God, the Word which is superior to the
precious letters and thoughts in the law and the prophets, on the
finding of which also all the rest are easily taken.  And the Saviour
holds converse with all the disciples, as merchant-men who are not only
seeking the goodly pearls but who have found them and possess them, when
He says, “Cast not your pearls before swine.” <span
id="fr_5190"></span>[5191](#fn_5190)   Now it is manifest that these
things were said to the disciples from that which is prefixed to His
words, “And seeing the multitudes He went up into the mountain, and when
He had sat down His disciples came unto Him;” <span
id="fr_5191"></span>[5192](#fn_5191) for, in the course of those words,
He said, “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast your
pearls before the swine.” <span id="fr_5192"></span>[5193](#fn_5192)  
Perhaps, then, he is not a disciple of Christ, who does not possess
pearls or the very costly pearl, the pearls, I mean, which are goodly;
not the cloudy, nor the darkened, such as the words of the heterodox,
which are brought forth not at the sunrise, but at the sunset or in the
north, if it is necessary to take also into the comparison those things
on account of which we found a difference in the pearls which are
produced in different places.  And perhaps the muddy words and the
heresies which are bound up with works of the flesh, are the darkened
pearls, and those which are produced in the marshes, not goodly pearls.
