id="xii.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—He Who Saves and He Who is
Saved.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.xv-p2"></span>I think not that I counted trivial
counsel concerning continence; following it, a man will not repent
thereof, but will save both himself and me who counselled. <span
id="fr_4399"></span>[4400](#fn_4399.md)   For it is no small reward to turn
back a wandering and perishing soul for its salvation. <span
id="fr_4400"></span>[4401](#fn_4400.md)   For this recompense we are able
to render to the God who created us, if he who speaks and hears both
speak and hear with faith and love.  Let us, therefore, continue in that
course in which we, righteous and holy, believed, that with confidence
we may ask God who saith, “Whilst thou art still speaking, I will say,
Here I am.” <span id="fr_4401"></span>[4402](#fn_4401.md)   For these words
are a token of a great promise, for the Lord saith that He is more ready
to give than he who asks.  So great, then, being the goodness of which
we are partakers, let us not grudge one another the attainment of so
great blessings.  For in proportion to the pleasure with which these
words are fraught to those who shall follow them, in that proportion is
the condemnation with which they are fraught to those who shall refuse
to hear.
