<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxxix-p1.1"></span>39.  Christ as Wisdom and Sanctification
and Redemption.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxix-p2"></span>We must not, however, pass over in
silence that He is of right the wisdom of God, and hence is called by
that name.  For the wisdom of the God and Father of all things does not
apprehend His substance in mere visions, like the phantasms of human
thoughts.  Whoever is able to conceive a bodiless existence of manifold
speculations which extend to the rationale of existing things, living
and, as it were, ensouled, he will see how well the Wisdom of God which
is above every creature speaks of herself, when she says: <span
id="fr_4632"></span>[4633](#fn_4632.md)   “God created me the beginning of
His ways, for His works.”  By this creating act the whole creation was
enabled to exist, not being unreceptive of that divine wisdom according
to which it was brought into being; for God, according to the prophet
David, <span id="fr_4633"></span>[4634](#fn_4633.md) made all things in
wisdom.  But many things came into being by the help of wisdom, which do
not lay hold of that by which they were created:  and few things indeed
there are which lay hold not only of that wisdom which con<span
id="page_318">p. 318</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.xxxix-Page_318"></span>cerns themselves, but of that which
has to do with many things besides, namely, of Christ who is the whole
of wisdom.  But each of the sages, in proportion as he embraces wisdom,
partakes to that extent of Christ, in that He is wisdom; just as every
one who is greatly gifted with power, in proportion as he has power, in
that proportion also has a share in Christ, inasmuch as He is power.
 The same is to be thought about sanctification and redemption; for
Jesus Himself is made sanctification to us and redemption.  Each of us
is sanctified with that sanctification, and redeemed with that
redemption.  Consider, moreover, if the words “to us,” added by the
Apostle, have any special force.  Christ, he says, “was made to us of
God, wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.”  In
other passages, he speaks about Christ as being wisdom, without any such
qualification, and of His being power, saying that Christ is the power
of God and the wisdom of God, though we might have conceived that He was
not the wisdom of God or the power of God, absolutely, but only for us. 
Now, in respect of wisdom and power, we have both forms of the
statement, the relative and the absolute; but in respect of
sanctification and redemption, this is not the case.  Consider,
therefore, since <span id="fr_4634"></span>[4635](#fn_4634.md) “He that
sanctifies and they that are sanctified are all of one,” whether the
Father is the sanctification of Him who is our sanctification, as,
Christ being our head, God is His head.  But Christ is our redemption
because we had become prisoners and needed ransoming.  I do not enquire
as to His own redemption, for though He was tempted in all things as we
are, He was without sin, and His enemies never reduced Him to captivity.
