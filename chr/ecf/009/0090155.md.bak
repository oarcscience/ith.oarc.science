id="xii.iv.lx-p1.1"></span>Chapter LX.—Prayer Continued.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.lx-p2"></span>Thou didst make to appear the enduring
fabric of the world by the works of Thy hand; Thou, Lord, didst create
the earth on which we dwell,—Thou, who art faithful in all generations,
just in judgments, wonderful in strength and majesty, with wisdom
creating and with understanding fixing the things which were made, who
art good among them that are being saved <span
id="fr_4322"></span>[4323](#fn_4322.md) and faithful among them whose trust
is in Thee; O merciful and Compassionate One, forgive us our iniquities
and offences and transgressions and trespasses.  Reckon not every sin of
Thy servants and handmaids, but Thou wilt purify us with the
purification of Thy truth; and direct our steps that we may walk in
holiness of heart and do what is good and well-pleasing in Thy sight and
in the sight of our rulers.  Yea, Lord, make Thy face to shine upon us
for good in peace, that we may be shielded by Thy mighty hand and
delivered from every sin by Thine uplifted arm, and deliver us from
those who hate us wrongfully.  Give concord and peace to us and all who
dwell upon the earth, even as Thou gavest to our fathers, when they
called upon Thee in faith and truth, submissive as we are to Thine
almighty and all-excellent Name.
