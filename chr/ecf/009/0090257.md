<span id="xv.iii.ii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.xviii-p1.1"></span>18.  How God Also is Light, But in a
Different Way; And How Life Came Before Light.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xviii-p2"></span>The Saviour is here called simply
light.  But in the Catholic Epistle of this same John <span
id="fr_4721"></span>[4722](#fn_4721.md) we read that God is light.  This,
it has been maintained, furnishes a proof that the Son is not in
substance different from the Father.  Another student, however, looking
into the matter more closely and with a sounder judgment, will say that
the light which shines in darkness and is not overtaken by it, is not
the same as the light in which there is no darkness at all.  The light
which shines in darkness comes upon this darkness, as it were, and is
pursued by it, and, in spite of attempts made upon it, is not
overtaken.  But the light in which there is no darkness at all neither
shines on darkness, nor is at first pursued by it, so as to prove victor
and to have it recorded that it was not overtaken by its pursuer.  The
third designation was “the true light.”  But in proportion as God, since
He is the Father of truth, is more and greater than truth, and since He
is the Father of wisdom is greater and more excellent than wisdom, in
the same proportion He is more than the true light.  We may learn,
perhaps, in a more suggestive manner, how the Father and the Son are two
lights, from David, who says in the thirty-fifth Psalm, <span
id="fr_4722"></span>[4723](#fn_4722.md) “In Thy light we shall see light.” 
This same light of men which shines in darkness, the true light, is
called, further on in the Gospel, the light of the world; Jesus
says, <span id="fr_4723"></span>[4724](#fn_4723.md) “I am the light of the
world.”  Nor must we omit to notice that whereas the passage might very
well have <span id="page_337">p. 337</span> <span
id="xv.iii.ii.xviii-Page_337"></span>run, “That which was made was in
Him the light of men, and the light of men was life,” he chose the
opposite order.  He puts life before the light of men, even if life and
the light of men are the same thing; in thinking of those who have part
in life, though that life is also the light of men, we are to come first
to the fact that they are living the divine life spoken of before; then
we come to their enlightenment.  For life must come first if the living
person is to be enlightened; it would not be a good arrangement to speak
of the illumination of one not yet conceived as living, and to make life
come after the illumination.  For though “life” and “the light” of men
are the same thing, the notions are taken separately.  This light of men
is also called, by Isaiah, “the light of the Gentiles,” where he
says, <span id="fr_4724"></span>[4725](#fn_4724.md) “Behold I have set Thee
for a covenant of the generation, for a light of the Gentiles;” and
David, placing his confidence in this light, says in the twenty-sixth
Psalm, <span id="fr_4725"></span>[4726](#fn_4725.md) “The Lord is my
illumination and my Saviour; whom shall I fear?”
