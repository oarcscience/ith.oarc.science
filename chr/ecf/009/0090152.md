<span id="xii.iv.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVII.—Let the Authors of Sedition
Submit Themselves.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.lvii-p2"></span>Ye therefore, who laid the foundation
of this sedition, submit yourselves to the presbyters, and receive
correction so as to repent, bending the knees of your hearts.  Learn to
be subject, laying aside the proud and arrogant self-confidence of your
tongue.  For it is better for you that ye should occupy <span
id="fr_4309"></span>[4310](#fn_4309.md) a humble but honourable place in
the flock of Christ, than that, being highly exalted, ye should be cast
out from the hope of His people. <span
id="fr_4310"></span>[4311](#fn_4310.md)   For thus speaketh all-virtuous
Wisdom:  “Behold, I will bring forth to you the words of my Spirit, and
I will teach you my speech.  Since I called, and ye did not hear; I held
forth my words, and ye regarded not, but set at naught my counsels, and
yielded not at my reproofs; therefore I too will laugh at your
destruction; yea, I will rejoice when ruin cometh upon you, and when
sudden confusion overtakes you, when overturning presents itself like a
tempest, or when tribulation and oppression <span
id="fr_4311"></span>[4312](#fn_4311.md) fall upon you.  For it shall come
to pass, that when ye call upon me, I will not hear you; the wicked
shall seek me, and they shall not find me.  For they hated wisdom, and
did not choose the fear of the Lord; nor would they listen to my
counsels, but despised my reproofs.  Wherefore they shall eat the fruits
of their own way, and they shall be filled <span
id="fr_4312"></span>[4313](#fn_4312.md) with their own ungodliness. <span
id="fr_4313"></span>[4314](#fn_4313.md) …For, in punishment for the wrongs
which they practised upon babes, shall they be slain, and inquiry will
be death to the ungodly; but he that heareth me shall rest in hope and
be undisturbed by the fear of any evil.”
