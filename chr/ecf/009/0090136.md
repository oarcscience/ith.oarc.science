Subject.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xli-p2"></span>Let every one of you, brethren, give
thanks <span id="fr_4217"></span>[4218](#fn_4217) to God in his own
order, living in all good conscience, with becoming gravity, and not
going beyond the rule of the ministry prescribed to him.  Not in every
place, brethren, are the daily sacrifices offered, or the
peace-offerings, or the sin-offerings and the trespass-offerings, but in
Jerusalem only.  And even there they are not offered in any place, but
only at the altar before the temple, that which is offered being first
carefully examined by the high priest and the ministers already
mentioned.  Those, therefore, who do anything beyond that which is
agreeable to His will, are punished with death.  Ye see, <span
id="fr_4218"></span>[4219](#fn_4218) brethren, that the greater the
knowledge that has been vouchsafed to us, the greater also is the danger
to which we are exposed.
