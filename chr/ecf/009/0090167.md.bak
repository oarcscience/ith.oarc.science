<span id="xii.vi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—This World Should Be
Despised.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.v-p2"></span>Wherefore, brethren, leaving \[willingly\]
our sojourn in this present world, let us do the will of Him that called
us, and not fear to depart out of this world.  For the Lord saith, “Ye
shall be as lambs in the midst of wolves.” <span
id="fr_4353"></span>[4354](#fn_4353.md)   And Peter answered and said unto
Him, <span id="fr_4354"></span>[4355](#fn_4354.md) “What, then, if the
wolves shall tear in pieces the lambs?”  Jesus said unto Peter, “The
lambs have no cause after they are dead to fear <span
id="fr_4355"></span>[4356](#fn_4355.md) the wolves; and in like manner,
fear not ye them that kill you, and can do nothing more unto you; but
fear Him who, after you are dead, has power over both soul and body to
cast them into hell-fire.” <span id="fr_4356"></span>[4357](#fn_4356.md)  
And consider, <span id="fr_4357"></span>[4358](#fn_4357.md) brethren, that
the sojourning in the flesh in this world is but brief and transient,
but the promise of Christ is great and wonderful, even the rest of the
kingdom to come, and of life everlasting. <span
id="fr_4358"></span>[4359](#fn_4358.md)   By what course of conduct, then,
shall we attain these things, but by leading a holy and righteous life,
and by deeming these worldly things as not belonging to us, and not
fixing our desires upon them?  For if we desire to possess them, we fall
away from the path of righteousness.
