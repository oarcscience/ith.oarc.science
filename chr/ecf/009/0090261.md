id="xv.iii.ii.xxii-p1.1"></span>22.  How the Darkness Failed to Overtake
the Light.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xxii-p2"></span>Should any one consider that we are
adding something that is not written, namely, the pursuit of the light
by the darkness, let him reflect that unless the darkness had pursued
the light the words, “The darkness did not overtake it,” would have no
meaning.  John writes for those who have wit to see what is omitted and
to supply it as the context requires, and so he wrote, “The darkness did
not overtake it.”  If it did not overtake it, it must first have pursued
it, <span id="page_339">p. 339</span> <span
id="xv.iii.ii.xxii-Page_339"></span>and that the darkness did pursue the
light is clear from what the Saviour suffered, and those also who
received His teachings, His own children, when darkness was doing what
it could against the sons of light and was minded to drive light away
from men.  But since, if God be for us, <span
id="fr_4742"></span>[4743](#fn_4742.md) no one, however that way minded,
can be against us, the more they humbled themselves the more they grew,
and they prevailed exceedingly.  In two ways the darkness did not
overtake the light.  Either it was left far behind and was itself so
slow, while the light was in its course so sharp and swift, that it was
not even able to keep following it, or if the light sought to lay a
snare for the darkness, and waited for it in pursuance of the plan it
had formed, then darkness, coming near the light, was brought to an
end.  In either case the darkness did not overtake the light.
