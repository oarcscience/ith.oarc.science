<span id="xvi.ii.vi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.x-p1.1"></span>10.  Concerning Those Who Demanded the
Half-Shekel.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.x-p2"></span>“*And when they were come to Capernaum,
they that received the half-shekel came to Peter.*” <span
id="fr_5903"></span>[5904](#fn_5903.md)   There are certain kings of the
earth, and the sons of these do not pay toll or tribute; and there are
others, different from their sons, who are strangers to the kings of the
earth, from whom the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute.  And
among the kings of the earth, their sons are free as among fathers; but
those who are strangers to them, while they are free in relation to
things beyond the earth, are as slaves in respect of those who lord it
over them and keep them in bondage; as the Egyptians lorded it over the
children of Israel, and greatly afflicted their life and violently held
them in bondage. <span id="fr_5904"></span>[5905](#fn_5904.md)   It was for
the sake of those who were in a bondage, corresponding to the bondage of
the Hebrews, that the Son of God took upon Him only the form of a
slave, <span id="fr_5905"></span>[5906](#fn_5905.md) doing no work that was
foul or servile.  As then, having the form of that slave, He pays toll
and tribute not different from that which was paid by His disciple; for
the same stater sufficed, even the one coin which was paid for Jesus and
His disciple.  But this coin was not in the house of Jesus, but it was
in the sea, and in the mouth of a fish of the sea which, in my judgment,
was benefited when it came up and was caught in the net of Peter, who
became a fisher of men, in which net was that which is figuratively
called a fish, in order also that the coin with the image of Cæsar might
be taken from it, and that it might take its place among those which
were caught by them who have learned to become fishers of men.  Let him,
then, who has the things of Cæsar render them to Cæsar, <span
id="fr_5906"></span>[5907](#fn_5906.md) that afterwards he may be able to
render to God the things of God.  But since Jesus, who was “the image of
the invisible God,” <span id="fr_5907"></span>[5908](#fn_5907.md) had not
the image of Cæsar, for “the prince of this age had nothing in
Him,” <span id="fr_5908"></span>[5909](#fn_5908.md) on this account He
takes from its own place, the sea, the image of Cæsar, that He may give
it to the kings of the earth for Himself and His disciple, so that those
who receive the half-shekel might not imagine that Jesus was the debtor
of them and of the kings of the earth; for He paid the debt, not having
taken it up, nor having possessed it, nor having acquired it, nor at any
time having made it His own possession, so that the image of Cæsar might
never be along with the image of the invisible God.
