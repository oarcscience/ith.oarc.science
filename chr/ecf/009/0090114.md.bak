id="xii.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Imitating These Examples, Let
Us Seek After Peace.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xix-p2"></span>Thus the humility and godly submission
of so great and illustrious men have rendered not only us, but also all
the generations before us, better; even as many as have received His
oracles in fear and truth.  Wherefore, having so many great and glorious
examples set before us, let us turn again to the practice of that peace
which from the beginning was the mark set before us; <span
id="fr_4093"></span>[4094](#fn_4093.md) and let us look stedfastly to the
Father and Creator of the universe, and cleave to His mighty and
surpassingly great gifts and benefactions of peace.  Let us contemplate
Him with our understanding, and look with the eyes of our soul to His
long-suffering will.  Let us reflect how free from the wrath He is
towards all His creation.
