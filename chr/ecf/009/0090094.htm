<p class="c12"><a name="xii.iii-p2"></A>Towards the close of 1875, at Constantinople, Philotheus Bryennius, Metropolitan of Serr&aelig;, published the first complete edition of the epistles ascribed to Clement.&#160; This he was enabled to do by the discovery of a <span class="sc"><a name="xii.iii-p2.1"></A>ms.</span> in the library of the Holy Sepulchre at Fanari in Constantinople.&#160; This <span class="sc"><a name="xii.iii-p2.2"></A>ms.</span>, of vellum, consists of one hundred and twenty leaves in small octavo, nearly seven and a half inches in length and six in breadth.&#160; The <span class="sc"><a name="xii.iii-p2.3"></A>ms.</span> bears the date 1056, and was written by one Leo.&#160; Its contents are:</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xii.iii-p3"></A>1.&#160; Chrysostom&#146;s Synopsis of the Old Testament (the New also being included in the title).</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xii.iii-p4"></A>2.&#160; Epistle of Barnabas.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xii.iii-p5"></A>3.&#160; Clement to the Corinthians I.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xii.iii-p6"></A>4.&#160; Clement to the Corinthians II.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xii.iii-p7"></A>5.&#160; Teaching of the Twelve Apostles.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xii.iii-p8"></A>6.&#160; Ignatian Epistles.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xii.iii-p9"></A>The <span class="sc"><a name="xii.iii-p9.1"></A>ms.</span> is written with comparative accuracy and clearness.&#160; Internal evidence seems to establish its independent value; <i>e.g.</i>, words carelessly omitted in the Codex Alexandrinus are found in this <span class="sc"><a name="xii.iii-p9.2"></A>ms.</span>&#160; It also supplies the <i>lacun&aelig;</i>, notably chapters 57 (concluding sentence)&#8212;63 inclusive of the first Epistle and chapters 12 (concluding sentences)&#8212;20, being the close of the second Epistle.&#160; Harnack seems to prove that the new <span class="sc"><a name="xii.iii-p9.3"></A>ms.</span> is as complete as the original Alexandrian.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xii.iii-p10"></A>The <i>lacuna</i> of the first Epistle consists mainly of a prayer, the writer somewhat abruptly passing from the <i>oratio obliqua</i> to the <i>oratio recta</i>.&#160; The prayer is indicative of intense earnestness and emotion rather than official authority.&#160; It is marked by wealth of quotation, especially from the Septuagint.&#160; Perhaps, too, the nature of the sufferings referred to in the opening chapters may be inferred from the petitions of this prayer.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xii.iii-p11"></A>In the Notes the old <span class="sc"><a name="xii.iii-p11.1"></A>ms.</span> is indicated by A, the recently discovered <span class="sc"><a name="xii.iii-p11.2"></A>ms.</span> by I.</p>
