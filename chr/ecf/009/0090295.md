id="xv.iii.v.xix-p1.1"></span>19.  Luke and John Suggest that One May
Loose the Shoe-Latchets of the Logos Without Stooping Down.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xix-p2"></span>We must not, however, omit to ask how
it comes that Luke and John give the speech without the phrase “to stoop
down.”  He, perhaps, who stoops down may be held to unloose in the sense
which we have stated.  On the other hand, it may be that one who fixes
his eyes on the height of the exaltation of the Logos, may find the
loosing of those shoes which when one is seeking them seem to be bound,
so that He also looses those shoes which are separable from the Logos,
and beholds the Logos divested of inferior things, as He is, the Son of
God.
