<span id="xii.vi.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.vi.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Reward of the Righteous,
Although They May Suffer.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.xix-p2"></span>So then, brothers and sisters, <span
id="fr_4408"></span>[4409](#fn_4408) after the God of truth <span
id="fr_4409"></span>[4410](#fn_4409) I address to you an appeal that ye
may give heed to the words written, <span
id="fr_4410"></span>[4411](#fn_4410) that ye may save both yourselves
and him who reads an address in your midst.  For as a reward I ask of
you repentance with the whole heart, while ye bestow upon yourselves
salvation and life.  For by so doing we shall set a mark for all the
young who wish to be diligent in godliness and the goodness of God.  And
let not us, in our folly, feel displeasure and indignation, whenever any
one admonishes us and turns us from unrighteousness to righteousness. 
For there are some wicked deeds which we commit, and know it not,
because of the double-mindedness and unbelief present in our breasts,
and our understanding is darkened by vain desires.  Let us, therefore,
work righteousness, that we may be saved to the end.  Blessed are they
who obey these commandments, even if for a brief space they suffer in
this world, and they will gather the imperishable fruit of the
resurrection.  Let not the godly man, therefore, grieve; if for the
present he suffer affliction, blessed is the time that awaits him there;
rising up to life again with the fathers he will rejoice for ever
without a grief.
