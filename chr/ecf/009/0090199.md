<span id="xv.iii.i.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.iii-p1.1"></span>3.  In the Spiritual Israel the
High-Priests are Those Who Devote Themselves to the Study of
Scripture.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.iii-p2"></span>But what is the bearing of all this
for us?  So you will ask when you read these words, Ambrosius, thou who
art truly a man of God, a man in Christ, and who seekest to be not a man
only, but a spiritual man. <span id="fr_4458"></span>[4459](#fn_4458)  
The bearing is this.  Those of the tribes offer to God, through the
levites and priests, tithes and first fruits; not everything which they
possess do they regard as tithe or first fruit.  The levites and
priests, on the other hand, have no possessions but tithes and first
fruits; yet they also in turn offer tithes to God through the
high-priests, and, I believe, first fruits too.  The same is the case
with those who approach Christian studies.  Most of us devote most of
our time to the things of this life, and dedicate to God only a few
special acts, thus resembling those members of the tribes who had but
few transactions with the priest, and discharged their religious duties
with no great expense of time.  But those who devote themselves to the
divine word and have no other employment but the service of God may not
unnaturally, allowing for the difference of occupation in the two cases,
be called our levites and priests.  And those who fulfil a more
distinguished office than their kinsmen <span
id="fr_4459"></span>[4460](#fn_4459) will perhaps be high-priests,
according to the order of Aaron, not that of Melchisedek.  Here some one
may object that it is somewhat too bold to apply the name of
high-priests to men, when Jesus Himself is spoken of in many a prophetic
passage as the one great priest, as <span
id="fr_4460"></span>[4461](#fn_4460) “We have a great high-priest who
has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God.”  But to this we
reply that the Apostle clearly defined his meaning, and declared the
prophet to have said about the Christ, “Thou <span
id="fr_4461"></span>[4462](#fn_4461) art a priest for ever, according to
the order of Melchisedek,” and not according to the order of Aaron.  We
say accordingly that men can be high-priests according to the order of
Aaron, but according to the order of Melchisedek only the Christ of God.
