<span id="xv.iii.ii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>6.  How the Word is the Maker of All
Things, and Even the Holy Spirit Was Made Through Him.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.vi-p2"></span>“*All things were made through Him.*” 
The “through <span id="fr_4677"></span>[4678](#fn_4677.md) whom” is never
found in the first place but always in the second, as in the Epistle to
the Romans, <span id="fr_4678"></span>[4679](#fn_4678.md) “Paul a servant
of Christ Jesus, a called Apostle, separated to the Gospel of God which
He promised before by His prophets in Holy Scriptures, concerning His
Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,
determined the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness,
by the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we
received grace and apostleship, for obedience of the faith among all the
nations, for His name’s sake.”  For God promised aforehand by the
prophets His own Gospel, the prophets being His ministers, and having
their word to speak about Him “through whom.”  And again God gave grace
and apostleship to Paul and to the others for the obedience of the faith
among all the nations, and this He gave them through Jesus Christ the
Saviour, for the “through whom” belonged to Him.  And the Apostle Paul
says in the Epistle to the Hebrews: <span
id="fr_4679"></span>[4680](#fn_4679.md)   “At the end of the days He spoke
to us in His Son, whom He made the heir of all things, ‘through whom’
also He made the ages,” showing us that God made the ages through His
Son, the “through whom” belonging, when the ages were being made, to the
Only-begotten.  Thus, if all things were made, as in this passage also,
*through* the Logos, then they were not made *by* the Logos, but by a
stronger and greater than He.  And who else could this be but the
Father?  Now if, as we have seen, all things were made through Him, we
have to enquire if the Holy Spirit also was made through Him.  It
appears to me that those who hold the Holy Spirit to be created, and who
also admit that “all things were made through Him,” must necessarily
assume that the Holy Spirit was made through the Logos, the Logos
accordingly being older than He.  And he who shrinks from allowing the
Holy Spirit to have been made through Christ must, if he admits the
truth of the statements of this Gospel, assume the Spirit to be
uncreated.  There is a third resource besides these two (that of
allowing the Spirit to have been made by the Word, and that of regarding
it as uncreated), namely, to assert that the Holy Spirit has no essence
of His own beyond the Father and the Son.  But on further thought one
may perhaps see reason to consider that the Son is second beside the
Father, He being the same as the Father, while manifestly a distinction
is drawn between the Spirit and the Son in the passage, <span
id="fr_4680"></span>[4681](#fn_4680.md) “Whosoever shall speak a word
against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him, but whosoever shall
blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, he shall not have forgiveness, either
in this world or in the world to come.”  We consider, therefore, that
there are three hypostases, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit;
and at the same time we believe nothing to be uncreated but the Father. 
We therefore, as the more pious and the truer course, admit that all
things were made by the Logos, and that the Holy Spirit is the most
excellent and the first in order <span
id="fr_4681"></span>[4682](#fn_4681.md) of all that was made by the Father
through Christ.  And this, perhaps, is the reason why the Spirit is not
said to be God’s own Son.  The Only-begotten only is by nature and from
the beginning a Son, and the Holy Spirit seems to have need of the Son,
to minister to Him His essence, so as to enable Him not only to exist,
but to be wise and reasonable and just, and all that we must think of
Him as being.  All this He has by participation of <span
id="page_329">p. 329</span> <span id="xv.iii.ii.vi-Page_329"></span>the
character of Christ, of which we have spoken above.  And I consider that
the Holy Spirit supplies to those who, through Him and through
participation in Him, are called saints, the material of the gifts,
which come from God; so that the said material of the gifts is made
powerful by God, is ministered by Christ, and owes its actual existence
in men to the Holy Spirit.  I am led to this view of the charisms by the
words of Paul which he writes somewhere, <span
id="fr_4682"></span>[4683](#fn_4682.md) “There are diversities of gifts but
the same Spirit, and diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord. 
And there are diversities of workings, but it is the same God that
worketh all in all.”  The statement that all things were made by Him,
and its seeming corollary, that the Spirit must have been called into
being by the Word, may certainly raise some difficulty.  There are some
passages in which the Spirit is placed above Christ; in Isaiah, for
example, Christ declares that He is sent, not by the Father only, but
also by the Holy Spirit.  “Now the Lord hath sent Me,” He says, <span
id="fr_4683"></span>[4684](#fn_4683.md) “and His Spirit,” and in the Gospel
He declares that there is forgiveness for the sin committed against
Himself, but that for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit there is no
forgiveness, either in this age or in the age to come.  What is the
reason of this?  Is it because the Holy Spirit is of more value than
Christ that the sin against Him cannot be forgiven?  May it not rather
be that all rational beings have part in Christ, and that forgiveness is
extended to them when they repent of their sins, while only those have
part in the Holy Spirit who have been found worthy of it, and that there
cannot well be any forgiveness for those who fall away to evil in spite
of such great and powerful cooperation, and who defeat the counsels of
the Spirit who is in them.  When we find the Lord saying, as He does in
Isaiah, that He is sent by the Father and by His Spirit, we have to
point out here also that the Spirit is not originally superior to the
Saviour, but that the Saviour takes a lower place than He in order to
carry out the plan which has been made that the Son of God should become
man.  Should any one stumble at our saying that the Saviour in becoming
man was made lower than the Holy Spirit, we ask him to consider the
words used in the Epistle to the Hebrews, <span
id="fr_4684"></span>[4685](#fn_4684.md) where Jesus is shown by Paul to
have been made less than the angels on account of the suffering of
death.  “We behold Him,” he says, “who hath been made a little lower
than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death, crowned with
glory and honour.”  And this, too, has doubtless to be added, that the
creation, in order to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and
not least of all the human race, required the introduction into human
nature of a happy and divine power, which should set right what was
wrong upon the earth, and that this action fell to the share, as it
were, of the Holy Spirit; but the Spirit, unable to support such a task,
puts forward the Saviour as the only one able to endure such a
conflict.  The Father therefore, the principal, sends the Son, but the
Holy Spirit also sends Him and directs Him to go before, promising to
descend, when the time comes, to the Son of God, and to work with Him
for the salvation of men.  This He did, when, in a bodily shape like a
dove, He flew to Him after the baptism.  He remained on Him, and did not
pass Him by, as He might have done with men not able continuously to
bear His glory.  Thus John, when explaining how he knew who Christ was,
spoke not only of the descent of the Spirit on Jesus, but also of its
remaining upon him.  For it is written that John said: <span
id="fr_4685"></span>[4686](#fn_4685.md)   “He who sent me to baptize said,
On whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him,
the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit and with fire.”  It
is not said only, “On whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending,”
for the Spirit no doubt descended on others too, but “descending and
abiding on Him.”  Our examination of this point has been somewhat
extended, since we were anxious to make it clear that if all things were
made by Him, then the Spirit also was made through the Word, and is seen
to be one of the “all things” which are inferior to their Maker.  This
view is too firmly settled to be disturbed by a few words which may be
adduced to the opposite effect.  If any one should lend credence to the
Gospel according to the Hebrews, where the Saviour Himself says, “My
mother, the Holy Spirit took me just now by one of my hairs and carried
me off to the great mount Tabor,” he will have to face the difficulty of
explaining how the Holy Spirit can be the mother of Christ when it was
itself brought into existence through the Word.  But neither the passage
nor this difficulty is hard to explain.  For if he who does the will of
the Father in heaven <span id="fr_4686"></span>[4687](#fn_4686.md) is
Christ’s brother and sister and mother, and if the name of brother of
Christ may be applied, not only to the race of men, but to beings of
diviner rank than they, <span id="page_330">p. 330</span> <span
id="xv.iii.ii.vi-Page_330"></span>then there is nothing absurd in the
Holy Spirit’s being His mother, every one being His mother who does the
will of the Father in heaven.

<span id="xv.iii.ii.vi-p13"></span>On the words, “All things were made
by Him,” there is still one point to be examined.  The “word” is, as a
notion, from “life,” and yet we read, “What was made in the Word was
life, and the life was the light of men.”  Now as all things were made
through Him, was the life made through Him, which is the light of men,
and the other notions under which the Saviour is presented to us?  Or
must we take the “all things were made by Him” subject to the exception
of the things which are in Himself?  The latter course appears to be the
preferable one.  For supposing we should concede that the life which is
the light of men was made through Him, since it said that the life “was
made” the light of men, what are we to say about wisdom, which is
conceived as being prior to the Word?  That, therefore, which is about
the Word (His relations or conditions) was not made by the Word, and the
result is that, with the exception of the notions under which Christ is
presented, all things were made through the Word of God, the Father
making them in wisdom.  “In wisdom hast Thou made them all,” it
says, <span id="fr_4687"></span>[4688](#fn_4687.md) not *through*, but *in*
wisdom.
