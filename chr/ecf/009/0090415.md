<span id="xvi.ii.v.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xviii-p1.1"></span>18.  Jesus Was at First Proclaimed by
the Twelve as a Worker and a Teacher Only.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xviii-p2"></span>But he who holds that the things
spoken to the Twelve refer to the times subsequent to this, and that the
Apostles had not as yet announced to their hearers that He was the
Christ, will say that He wished the conception of the Christ which was
involved in the name of Jesus to be reserved for that preaching which
was more perfect, and which brought salvation, such as Paul knew of when
he said to the Corinthians, “I determined not to know anything among you
save Jesus Christ and Him crucified.” <span
id="fr_5677"></span>[5678](#fn_5677)   Wherefore, formerly they
proclaimed Jesus as the doer of certain things, and the teacher of
certain things; but now when Peter confesses that He was the Christ, the
Son of the living God, as He did not wish it to be proclaimed already
that He was the Christ, in order that He might be proclaimed at a more
suitable time, and that as crucified, He commands His disciples that
they should tell no man that He was the Christ.  And that this was His
meaning, when He forbade proclamation to be made that He was the Christ,
is in a measure established by the words, “From that time began Jesus to
show unto His disciples how that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer
many things of the elders,” and what is annexed; <span
id="fr_5678"></span>[5679](#fn_5678) for then, at the fitting time, He
proclaims, so to speak, to the disciples who knew that Jesus was Christ,
the Son of the living God, the Father having revealed it to them, that
instead of believing in Jesus Christ who had been crucified, they were
to believe in Jesus Christ who was about to be crucified.  But also,
instead of believing in Christ Jesus and Him risen from the dead, He
teaches them to believe in Christ Jesus and Him about to be risen from
the dead.  But since “having put off from Himself the principalities and
the powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over in the
cross,” <span id="fr_5679"></span>[5680](#fn_5679) if any one is ashamed
of the cross of Christ, he is ashamed of the dispensation on account of
which these powers were triumphed over; and it is fitting that he, who
both believes and knows these things, should glory in the cross of our
Lord Jesus Christ, <span id="fr_5680"></span>[5681](#fn_5680) through
which, when Christ was crucified, the principalities—among which, I
think, was also the prince of this world—were made a show of and
triumphed over before the believing world.  Wherefore, when His
suffering was at hand he said, “Now the prince of this world has been
judged,” <span id="fr_5681"></span>[5682](#fn_5681) and, “Now shall the
prince of this world be cast out,” and, “I, if I be lifted from the
earth, will draw all men unto Myself;” <span
id="fr_5682"></span>[5683](#fn_5682) as he no longer had sufficient
power to prevent those going to Jesus who were being drawn by Him.
