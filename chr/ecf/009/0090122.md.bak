id="xii.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—In the Hope of the
Resurrection, Let Us Cleave to the Omnipotent and Omniscient God.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xxvii-p2"></span>Having then this hope, let our souls
be bound to Him who is faithful in His promises, and just in His
judgments.  He who has commanded us not to lie, shall much more Himself
not lie; for nothing is impossible with God, except to lie. <span
id="fr_4126"></span>[4127](#fn_4126.md)   Let His faith therefore be
stirred up again within us, and let us consider that all things are nigh
unto Him.  By the word of His might <span
id="fr_4127"></span>[4128](#fn_4127.md) He established all things, and by
His word He can overthrow them.  “Who shall say unto Him, What hast thou
done? or, Who shall resist the power of His strength?” <span
id="fr_4128"></span>[4129](#fn_4128.md)   When, and as He pleases, He will
do all things, and none of the things determined by Him shall pass
away. <span id="fr_4129"></span>[4130](#fn_4129.md)   All things are open
before Him, and nothing can be hidden from His counsel.  “The
heavens <span id="fr_4130"></span>[4131](#fn_4130.md) declare the glory of
God, and the firmament showeth His handy-work. <span
id="fr_4131"></span>[4132](#fn_4131.md)   Day unto day uttereth speech, and
night unto night showeth knowledge.  And there are no words or speeches
of which the voices are not heard.” <span
id="fr_4132"></span>[4133](#fn_4132.md)
