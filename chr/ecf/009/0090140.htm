<p class="c12"><a name="xii.iv.xlv-p2"></A>Ye are fond of contention, brethren, and full of zeal about things which do not pertain to salvation.&#160; Look carefully into the Scriptures, which are the true utterances of the Holy Spirit.&#160; Observe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4236"></A><A HREF="#fn_4236"><FONT SIZE="1">4237</FONT></A>
 that nothing of an unjust or counterfeit character is written in them.&#160; There&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4237"></A><A HREF="#fn_4237"><FONT SIZE="1">4238</FONT></A>
 you will not find that the righteous were cast off by men who themselves were holy.&#160; The righteous were indeed persecuted, but only by the wicked.&#160; They were cast into prison, but only by the unholy; they were stoned, but only by transgressors; they were slain, but only by the accursed, and such as had conceived an unrighteous envy against them.&#160; Exposed to such sufferings, they endured them gloriously.&#160; For what shall we say, brethren?&#160; Was Daniel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4238"></A><A HREF="#fn_4238"><FONT SIZE="1">4239</FONT></A>

 of fire by those who observed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4240"></A><A HREF="#fn_4240"><FONT SIZE="1">4241</FONT></A>
 the great and glorious worship of the Most High?&#160; Far from us be such a thought!&#160; Who, then, were they that did such things?&#160; The hateful, and those full of all wickedness, were roused to such a pitch of fury, that they inflicted torture on those who served God with a holy and blameless purpose [of heart], not knowing that the Most High is the Defender and Protector of all such as with a pure conscience venerate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4241"></A><A HREF="#fn_4241"><FONT SIZE="1">4242</FONT></A>
 His all-excellent name; to whom be glory for ever and ever.&#160; Amen.&#160; But they who with confidence endured [these things] are now heirs of glory and honour, and have been exalted and made illustrious&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4242"></A><A HREF="#fn_4242"><FONT SIZE="1">4243</FONT></A>
 by God in their memorial for ever and ever.&#160; Amen.</p>
