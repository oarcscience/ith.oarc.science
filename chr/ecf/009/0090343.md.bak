<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>28.  The Difference Between Believing
in the Name of Jesus and Believing in Jesus Himself.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxviii-p2"></span>“Now, when He was in Jerusalem at
the passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, beholding His
signs which He did.  But He, Jesus, did not trust Himself to them,
because He knew all (men) and because He needed not that any should
testify of man, for he Himself knew what was in man.” <span
id="fr_5141"></span>[5142](#fn_5141.md)   One might ask how Jesus did not
Himself believe in those of whom we are told that they believed.  To
this we must say it was not those who believed in Him that Jesus did not
trust, but those who believed in His name; for believing in His name is
a different thing from believing in Him.  He who will not be judged
because of his faith is exempted from the judgment, not for believing in
His name, but for believing in Him; for the Lord says, <span
id="fr_5142"></span>[5143](#fn_5142.md) “He that believeth in Me is not
judged,” not, “He who believes in My name is not judged;” the latter
believes, and hence he is not worthy to be condemned already, but he is
inferior to the other who believes in Him.  Hence it is that Jesus does
not trust Himself to him who believes in His name.  We must, therefore,
cleave to Him rather than to His name, lest after we have done wonders
in His name, we should hear these words addressed to us which He will
speak to those who boast of His name alone. <span
id="fr_5143"></span>[5144](#fn_5143.md)   With the Apostle Paul <span
id="fr_5144"></span>[5145](#fn_5144.md) let us seek <span id="page_408">p.
408</span> <span id="xv.iii.vi.xxviii-Page_408"></span>joyfully to say,
“I can do all things in Christ Jesus strengthening me.”  We have also to
notice that in a former passage <span
id="fr_5145"></span>[5146](#fn_5145.md) the Evangelist calls the passover
that of the Jews, while here he does not say that Jesus was at the
passover of the Jews, but at the passover at Jerusalem; and in the
former case when the passover is called that of the Jews, it is not said
to be a feast; but here Jesus is recorded to have been at the feast;
when at Jerusalem He was at the passover during the feast, and many
believed, even though only in His name.  We ought to notice certainly
that “many” are said to believe, not in Him, but in His name.  Now,
those who believe in Him are those who walk in the straight and narrow
way, <span id="fr_5146"></span>[5147](#fn_5146.md) which leads to life, and
which is found by few.  It may well be, however, that many of those who
believe in His name will sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in
the kingdom of heaven, the Father’s house, in which are many mansions. 
And it is to be noted that the many who believe in His name do not
believe in the same way as Andrew does, and Peter, and Nathanael, and
Philip.  These believe the testimony of John when he says, “Behold the
Lamb of God,” or they believe in Christ as found by Andrew, or Jesus
saying to Philip, “Follow Me,” or Philip saying, “We have found Him of
whom Moses and the prophets did write, Jesus the Son of Joseph from
Nazareth.”  Those, on the other hand, of whom we now speak, “believed in
His name, beholding His signs which He did.”  And as they believe the
signs and not in Him but in His name, Jesus “did not trust Himself to
them, because He knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of
man, because He knew what is in every man.”
