<span id="xv.iii.i.xix-p2"></span>In addition to these meanings there is
that in which we speak of an arche, <span
id="fr_4539"></span>[4540](#fn_4539.md) according to form; thus if the
first-born of every creature <span id="fr_4540"></span>[4541](#fn_4540.md)
is the image of the invisible God, then the Father is his arche.  In the
same way Christ is the arche of those who are made according to the
image of God.  For if men are according to the image, but the image
according to the Father; in the first case the Father is the arche of
Christ, and in the other Christ is the arche of men, and men are made,
not according to that of which he is the image, but according to the
image.  With this example our passage will agree:  “In the arche was the
Word.”
