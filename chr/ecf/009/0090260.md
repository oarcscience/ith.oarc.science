<span id="xv.iii.ii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span>21.  Christ is Not, Like God, Quite Free
from Darkness:  Since He Bore Our Sins.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xxi-p2"></span>Now some one will ask how this
statement that there is no darkness in Him can be regarded as a thing
peculiar to Him, when we consider that the Saviour also was quite
without sin.  Could it not be said of Him also that “He is light, and
that there is no darkness in Him”?  The difference between the two cases
has been partly set forth above.  We will now, however, go a step
further than we did before, and add, that if God made Christ who knew no
sin to be sin for us, <span id="fr_4734"></span>[4735](#fn_4734.md) then it
could not be said of Him that there was no darkness in Him.  For if
Jesus was in the likeness <span id="fr_4735"></span>[4736](#fn_4735.md) of
the flesh of sin and for sin, and condemned sin by taking upon Him the
likeness of the flesh of sin, then it cannot be said of Him, absolutely
and directly, that there was no darkness in Him.  We may add that
“He <span id="fr_4736"></span>[4737](#fn_4736.md) took our infirmities and
bare our sicknesses,” both infirmities of the soul and sicknesses of the
hidden man of our heart.  On account of these infirmities and sicknesses
which He bore away from us, He declares His soul to be sorrowful and
sore troubled, <span id="fr_4737"></span>[4738](#fn_4737.md) and He is said
in Zechariah to have put on filthy garments, <span
id="fr_4738"></span>[4739](#fn_4738.md) which, when He was about to take
them off, are said to be sins.  “Behold, it is said, I have taken away
thy sins.”  Because He had taken on Himself the sins of the people of
those who believed in Him, he uses many such expressions as these:  “Far
from my salvation are the words of my transgressions,” <span
id="fr_4739"></span>[4740](#fn_4739.md) and “Thou knowest my foolishness,
and my sins were not hid from Thee.” <span
id="fr_4740"></span>[4741](#fn_4740.md)   And let no one suppose that we
say this from any lack of piety towards the Christ of God; for as the
Father alone has immortality and our Lord took upon Himself, for His
love to men, the death He died for us, so to the Father alone the words
apply, “In Him is no darkness,” since Christ took upon Himself, for His
goodwill towards men, our darknesses.  This He did, that by His power He
might destroy our death and remove the darkness which is in our soul, so
that the saying in Isaiah might be fulfilled, <span
id="fr_4741"></span>[4742](#fn_4741.md) “The people that sat in darkness
saw a great light.”  This light, which came into being in the Logos, and
is also life, shines in the darkness of our souls, and it has come where
the rulers of this darkness carry on their struggle with the race of men
and strive to subdue to darkness those who do not stand firm with all
their power; that they might be enlightened the light has come so far,
and that they might be called sons of light.  And shining in darkness
this light is pursued by the darkness, but not overtaken.
