<span id="xii.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Praise of the Corinthians
Continued.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.ii-p2"></span>Moreover, ye were all distinguished by
humility, and were in no respect puffed up with pride, but yielded
obedience rather than extorted it, <span
id="fr_4001"></span>[4002](#fn_4001) and were more willing to give than
to receive. <span id="fr_4002"></span>[4003](#fn_4002)   Content with
the provision which God <span id="fr_4003"></span>[4004](#fn_4003) had
made for you, and carefully attending to His words, ye were inwardly
filled <span id="fr_4004"></span>[4005](#fn_4004) with His doctrine, and
His sufferings were before your eyes.  Thus a profound and abundant
peace was given to you all, and ye had an insatiable desire for doing
good, while a full outpouring of the Holy Spirit was upon you all.  Full
of holy designs, ye did, with true earnestness of mind and a godly
confidence, stretch forth your hands to God Almighty, beseeching Him to
be merciful unto you, if ye had been guilty of any involuntary
transgression.  Day and night ye were anxious for the whole
brotherhood, <span id="fr_4005"></span>[4006](#fn_4005) that the number
of God’s elect might be saved with mercy <span
id="fr_4006"></span>[4007](#fn_4006) and a good conscience. <span
id="fr_4007"></span>[4008](#fn_4007)   Ye were sincere and uncorrupted,
and forgetful of injuries between <span id="page_230">p. 230</span>
<span id="xii.iv.ii-Page_230"></span>one another.  Every kind of faction
and schism was abominable in your sight.  Ye mourned over the
transgressions of your neighbours:  their deficiencies you deemed your
own.  Ye never grudged any act of kindness, being “ready to every good
work.” <span id="fr_4008"></span>[4009](#fn_4008)   Adorned by a
thoroughly virtuous and religious life, ye did all things in the fear of
God.  The commandments and ordinances of the Lord were written upon the
tablets of your hearts. <span id="fr_4009"></span>[4010](#fn_4009)
