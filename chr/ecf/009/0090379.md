<span id="xvi.ii.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>2.  Exposition of the Details of the
Miracle.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.ii-p2"></span>Jesus, then, because of the power
which He gave to the disciples, even the power of nourishing others,
said, Give ye them to eat. <span id="fr_5343"></span>[5344](#fn_5343.md)  
But (not denying that they can give loaves, but thinking that there were
much too few and not sufficient to feed those who followed Jesus, and
not considering that when Jesus takes each loaf—the Word—He extends it
as far as He wills, and makes it suffice for all whomsoever He desires
to nourish), the disciples say, We have here but five loaves and two
fishes. <span id="fr_5344"></span>[5345](#fn_5344.md)   Perhaps by the five
loaves they meant to make a veiled reference to the sensible words of
the Scriptures, corresponding in number on this account to the five
senses, but by the two fishes either to the word expressed <span
id="fr_5345"></span>[5346](#fn_5345.md) and the word conceived, <span
id="fr_5346"></span>[5347](#fn_5346.md) which are a relish, so to speak, to
the sensible things contained in the Scriptures; <span id="page_432">p.
432</span> <span id="xvi.ii.iv.ii-Page_432"></span>or, perhaps, to the
word which had come to them about the Father and the Son.  Wherefore
also after His resurrection He ate of a broiled fish, <span
id="fr_5347"></span>[5348](#fn_5347.md) having taken a part from the
disciples, and having received that theology about the Father which they
were in part able to declare to Him.  Such is the contribution we have
been able to give to the exposition of the word about the five loaves
and the two fishes; and probably those, who are better able than we to
gather together the five loaves and the two fishes among themselves,
would be able to give a fuller and better interpretation of their
meaning.  It must be observed, however, that while in Matthew, Mark, and
Luke, <span id="fr_5348"></span>[5349](#fn_5348.md) the disciples say that
they have the five loaves and the two fishes, without indicating whether
they were wheaten or of barley, John alone says, that the loaves were
barley loaves. <span id="fr_5349"></span>[5350](#fn_5349.md)   Wherefore,
perhaps, in the Gospel of John the disciples do not acknowledge that the
loaves are with them, but say in John, “There is a lad here who has five
barley loaves and two fishes.” <span
id="fr_5350"></span>[5351](#fn_5350.md)   And so long as these five loaves
and two fishes were not carried by the disciples of Jesus, they did not
increase or multiply, nor were they able to nourish more; but, when the
Saviour took them, and in the first placed looked up to heaven, with the
rays of His eyes, as it were, drawing down from it power which was to be
mingled with the loaves and the fishes which were about to feed the five
thousand; and after this blessed the five loaves and the two fishes,
increasing and multiplying them by the word and the blessing; and in the
third place dividing and breaking He gave to the disciples that they
might set them before the multitudes, then the loaves and the fishes
were sufficient, so that all ate and were satisfied, and some portions
of the loaves which had been blessed they were unable to eat.  For so
much remained over to the multitudes, which was not according to the
capacity of the multitudes but of the disciples who were able to take up
that which remained over of the broken pieces, and to place it in
baskets filled with that which remained over, which were in number so
many as the tribes of Israel.  Concerning Joseph, then, it is written in
the Psalms, “His hands served in the basket,” <span
id="fr_5351"></span>[5352](#fn_5351.md) but about the disciples of Jesus
that they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces twelve
baskets, twelve baskets, I take it, not half-full but filled.  And there
are, I think, up to the present time, and will be until the consummation
of the age with the disciples of Jesus, who are superior to the
multitudes, the twelve baskets, filled with the broken pieces of living
bread which the multitudes cannot eat.  Now those who ate of the five
loaves which existed before the twelve baskets that remained over, were
kindred in nature to the number five; for those who ate had reached the
stage of sensible things, since also they were nourished by Him who
looked up to heaven and blessed and brake them, and were not boys nor
women, but men.  For there are, I think, even in sensible foods
differences, so that some of them belong to those who “have put away
childish things,” <span id="fr_5352"></span>[5353](#fn_5352.md) and some to
those who are still babes and carnal in Christ.
