<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>37.  Force of the Words “Before
Them.”</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxvii-p2"></span>But you will ask if, when He was
transfigured before those who were led up by Him into the lofty
mountain, He appeared to them in the form of God, in which He formerly
was, so that He had to those below the form of a servant, but to those
who had followed Him after the six days to the lofty mountain, He had
not that form, but the form of God.  But hear these things, if you can,
at the same time giving heed spiritually, that it is not said simply,
“He was transfigured,” but with a certain necessary addition, which
Matthew and Mark have recorded; for, according to both, “He was
transfigured before them.” <span id="fr_5780"></span>[5781](#fn_5780)  
And according to this, indeed, you will say that it is possible for
Jesus to be transfigured before some with this transfiguration, but
before others at the same time not to be transfigured.  But if you wish
to see the transfiguration of Jesus before those who went up into the
lofty mountain apart long with Him, behold with me the Jesus in the
Gospels, as more simply apprehended, and as one might say, known
“according to the flesh,” by those who do not go up, through works and
words which are uplifting, to the lofty mountain of wisdom, but known no
longer after the flesh, but known in His divinity by means of all the
Gospels, and beholden in the form of God according to their knowledge;
for before them is Jesus transfigured, and not to any one of those
below.  But when He is transfigured, His face also shines as the sun,
that He may be manifested to the children of light, who have put off the
works of darkness, and put on the armour of light, <span
id="fr_5781"></span>[5782](#fn_5781) and are no longer the children of
darkness or night, but have become the sons of day, and walk honestly as
in the day; <span id="fr_5782"></span>[5783](#fn_5782) and being
manifested, He will shine unto them not simply as the sun, but as
demonstrated to be the sun of righteousness.
