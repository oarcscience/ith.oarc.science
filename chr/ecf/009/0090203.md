<span id="xv.iii.i.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.vii-p1.1"></span>7.  What Good Things are Announced in the
Gospels.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.vii-p2"></span>But it is time we should inquire what
is the meaning of the designation “Gospel,” and why these books have
this title.  Now the Gospel is a discourse containing a promise of
things which naturally, and on account of the benefits they bring,
rejoice the hearer as soon as the promise is heard and believed.  Nor is
such a discourse any the less a Gospel that we define it with reference
to the position of the hearer.  A Gospel is either a word which implies
the actual presence to the believer of something that is good, or a word
promising the arrival of a good which is expected.  Now all these
definitions apply to those books which are named Gospels.  For each of
the Gospels is a collection of announcements which are useful to him who
believes them and does not misinterpret them; it brings him a benefit
and naturally makes him glad because it tells of the sojourn with men,
on account of men, and for their salvation, of the first-born of all
creation, <span id="fr_4484"></span>[4485](#fn_4484) Christ Jesus.  And
again each Gospel tells of the sojourn of the good Father in the Son
with those minded to receive Him, as is plain to every believer; and
moreover by these books a good is announced which had been formerly
expected, as is by no means hard to see.  For John the Baptist spoke in
the name almost of the whole people when he sent to Jesus and
asked, <span id="fr_4485"></span>[4486](#fn_4485) “Art thou He that
should come or do we look for another?”  For to the people the Messiah
was an expected good, which the prophets had foretold, and they all
alike, though under the law and the prophets, fixed their hopes on Him,
as the Samaritan woman bears witness when she says: <span
id="fr_4486"></span>[4487](#fn_4486)   “I know that the Messiah comes,
who is called Christ; when He comes He will tell us all things.”  Simon
and Cleopas too, when talking to each other about all that had happened
to Jesus Christ Himself, then risen, though they did not know that He
had risen from the dead, speak thus, <span
id="fr_4487"></span>[4488](#fn_4487) “Dost thou sojourn alone in
Jerusalem, and knowest not the things which have taken place there in
these days?  And when he said what things? they answered, The things
concerning Jesus of Nazareth, <span id="fr_4488"></span>[4489](#fn_4488)
which was a prophet, mighty in <span id="page_301">p. 301</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.vii-Page_301"></span>deed and in word before God and all
the people, and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him up to
be sentenced to death and crucified Him.  But we hoped that it was He
which should redeem Israel.”  Again, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter
found his own brother Simon and said to him, <span
id="fr_4489"></span>[4490](#fn_4489) “We have found the Messiah, which
is, being interpreted, Christ.”  And a little further on Philip finds
Nathanael and says to him, <span id="fr_4490"></span>[4491](#fn_4490)
“We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote,
Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”
