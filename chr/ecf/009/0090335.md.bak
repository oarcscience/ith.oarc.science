<span id="xv.iii.vi.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.xx-p1.1"></span>20.  The Temple Which Christ Says He Will
Raise Up is the Church.  How the Dry Bones Will Be Made to Live
Again.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.xx-p2"></span>“The Jews then answered and said unto
Him, What sign showest Thou unto us, seeing that Thou doest these
things? <span id="fr_5084"></span>[5085](#fn_5084.md)   Jesus answered and
said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
up.”  Those of the body, and those who incline to material things, seem
to me to be meant by the Jews, who, after Jesus has driven out those who
make God’s house a house of merchandise, are angry at Him for treating
these matters in such a way, and demand a sign, a sign which will show
that the Word, whom they do not receive, has a right to do such things. 
The Saviour joins on to His statement about the temple a statement which
is really one with the former, about His own body, and to the question,
What sign doest Thou, seeing that Thou doest such things? answers,
“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”  He could
have exhibited a thousand other signs, but to the question, “Seeing that
Thou doest such things,” He could not answer anything else; He fittingly
gave the answer about the sign connected with the temple, and not about
signs unconnected with the temple.  Now, both of these two things, the
temple and the body of Jesus, appear to me, in one interpretation at
least, to be types of the Church, and to signify that it is built of
living stones, <span id="fr_5085"></span>[5086](#fn_5085.md) a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, built <span
id="fr_5086"></span>[5087](#fn_5086.md) on the foundation of the Apostles
and prophets, Christ Jesus being the head corner-stone; and it is,
therefore, called a temple.  Now, from the text, <span
id="fr_5087"></span>[5088](#fn_5087.md) “Ye are the body of Christ, and
members each in his part,” we see that even though the harmonious
fitting of the stones of the temple appear to be dissolved and
scattered, as it is written in the twenty-second Psalm <span
id="fr_5088"></span>[5089](#fn_5088.md) that all the bones of Christ are,
by the plots made against it in persecutions and afflictions, on the
part of those who war against the unity of the temple in persecutions,
yet the temple will be raised again, and the body will rise again on the
third day after the day of evil which threatens it, <span
id="fr_5089"></span>[5090](#fn_5089.md) and the day of consummation which
follows.  For the third day will rise on the new heaven and the new
earth, when these bones, the whole house of Israel, <span
id="fr_5090"></span>[5091](#fn_5090.md) will rise in the great Lord’s day,
death having been overcome.  And thus the resurrection of <span
id="page_401">p. 401</span> <span id="xv.iii.vi.xx-Page_401"></span>the
Saviour from the passion of the cross contains the mystery of the
resurrection of the whole body of Christ.  But as that material body of
Jesus was sacrificed for Christ, and was buried, and was afterwards
raised, so the whole body of Christ’s saints is crucified along with
Him, and now lives no longer; for each of them, like Paul, glories <span
id="fr_5091"></span>[5092](#fn_5091.md) in nothing but the cross of our
Lord Jesus Christ, through which He is crucified to the world, and the
world to Him.  Not only, therefore, is it crucified with Christ, and
crucified to the world; it is also buried with Christ, for we were
buried with Christ, Paul says. <span
id="fr_5092"></span>[5093](#fn_5092.md)   And then he says, as if enjoying
some earnest of the resurrection, “We rose with Him,” <span
id="fr_5093"></span>[5094](#fn_5093.md) because He walks in a certain
newness of life, though not yet risen in that blessed and perfect
resurrection which is hoped for.  Either, then, he is now crucified, and
afterwards is buried, or he is now buried and taken down from the cross,
and, being now buried, is to rise at some future time.  But to most of
us the mystery of the resurrection is a great one, and difficult of
contemplation; it is spoken of in many other passages of Scripture, and
is specially announced in the following passage of Ezekiel: <span
id="fr_5094"></span>[5095](#fn_5094.md)   “And the hand of the Lord was
upon me, and He led me out in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me in the
midst of the plain, and it was full of human bones.  And He led me round
about them in a circle, and behold there were very many on the face of
the plain, and behold they were very dry.  And He said to me, Son of
man, shall these bones live?  And I said, Lord, Lord, Thou knowest.  And
He said to me, Prophesy to these bones, and thou shalt say to them, Hear
the word of the Lord, ye dry bones;” and a little further on, “And the
Lord spake to me, saying, Son of man, these bones are the house of
Israel.  And they say, Our bones are become dry, our hope is lost, we
have breathed our last.”  For what bones are these which are addressed,
“Hear ye the word of the Lord,” as if they heard the word of the Lord? 
They belong to the house of Israel, or to the body of Christ, of which
the Lord says, <span id="fr_5095"></span>[5096](#fn_5095.md) “All My bones
are scattered,” although the bones of His body were not scattered, and
not even one of them was broken.  But when the resurrection itself takes
place of the true and more perfect body of Christ, then those who are
now the members of Christ, for they will then be dry bones, will be
brought together, bone to bone, and fitting to fitting (for none of
those who are destitute of fitting (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.xx-p14.2"></span>ἁρμονία</span>) will come to the perfect
man), to the measure <span id="fr_5096"></span>[5097](#fn_5096.md) of the
stature of the fulness of the body of Christ.  And then the many
members <span id="fr_5097"></span>[5098](#fn_5097.md) will be the one body,
all of them, though many, becoming members of one body.  But it belongs
to God alone to make the distinction of foot and hand and eye and
hearing and smelling, which in one sense fill up the head, but in
another the feet and the rest of the members, and the weaker and humbler
ones, the more and the less honourable.  God will temper the body
together, and then, rather than now, He will give to that which lacks
the more abundant honour, that there may be, by no means, any schism in
the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another,
and, if any member be well off, all the members may share in its good
things, or if any member be glorified, all the members may rejoice with
it.
