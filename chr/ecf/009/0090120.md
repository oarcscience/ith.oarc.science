id="xii.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—The Phœnix an Emblem of Our
Resurrection.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xxv-p2"></span>Let us consider that wonderful sign \[of
the resurrection\] which takes place in eastern lands, that is, in
Arabia and the countries round about.  There is a certain bird which is
called a phœnix.  This is the only one of its kind, and lives five
hundred years.  And when the time of its dissolution draws near that it
must die, it builds itself a nest of <span id="page_237">p. 237</span>
<span id="xii.iv.xxv-Page_237"></span>frankincense, and myrrh, and other
spices, into which, when the time is fulfilled, it enters and dies.  But
as the flesh decays a certain kind of worm is produced, which, being
nourished by the juices of the deed bird, brings forth feathers.  Then,
when it has acquired strength, it takes up that nest in which are the
bones of its parent, and bearing these it passes <span
id="fr_4119"></span>[4120](#fn_4119) from the land of Arabia into Egypt,
to the city called Heliopolis.  And, in open day, flying <span
id="fr_4120"></span>[4121](#fn_4120) in the sight of all men, it places
them on the altar of the sun, and having done this, hastens back to its
former abode.  The priests then inspect the registers of the dates, and
find that it has returned exactly as the five hundredth year was
completed. <span id="fr_4121"></span>[4122](#fn_4121)
