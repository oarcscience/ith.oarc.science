<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xii-p1.1"></span>12.  The Time of the Reckoning.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xii-p2"></span>But it is fitting to examine at what
time the man—the king—in the parable wished <span id="page_502">p.
502</span> <span id="xvi.ii.vii.xii-Page_502"></span>to make a reckoning
with his own servants, and to what period we ought to refer the things
that are said.  For if it be after the consummation, or at it at the
time of the expected judgment, how are we to maintain the things about
him who owed a hundred pence, and was taken by the throat by the man who
had been forgiven the many talents?  But if, before the judgment, how
can we explain the reckoning that was made before this by the king, with
his own servants?  But we ought to think in a general way about every
parable, the interpretation of which has not been recorded by the
evangelists, even though Jesus explained all things to His own disciples
privately; <span id="fr_6115"></span>[6116](#fn_6115) and for this
reason the writers of the Gospels have concealed the clear exposition of
the parables, because the things signified by them were beyond the power
of the nature of words to express, and every solution and exposition of
such parables was of such a kind that not even the whole world itself
could contain the books that should be written <span
id="fr_6116"></span>[6117](#fn_6116) in relation to such parables.  But
it may happen that a fitting heart be found, and, because of its purity,
able to receive the letters of the exposition of the parable, so that
they could be written in it by the Spirit of the living God.  But some
one will say that, perhaps, we act with impiety, who, because of the
secret and mystical import of some of the Scriptures which are of
heavenly origin, wish them to be symbolic, and endeavour to expound
them, even though it might seem *ex hypothesi* that we had an accurate
knowledge of their meaning.  But to this we must say that, if there be
those who have obtained the gift of accurate apprehension of these
things, they know what they ought to do; but as for us, who acknowledge
that we fall short of the ability to see into the depth of the things
here signified, even though we obtain a somewhat crass perception of the
things in the passage, we will say, that some of the things which we
seem to find after much examination and inquiry, whether by the grace of
God, or by the power of our own mind, we do not venture to commit to
writing; but some things, for the sake of our own intellectual
discipline, and that of those who may chance to read them, we will to
some extent set forth.  But let these things, then, be said by way of
apology, because of the depth of the parable; but, with regard to the
question at what time the man—the king—in the parable wished to make a
reckoning with his own servants, we will say that it seems that this
takes place about the time of the judgment which had been proclaimed. 
And this is confirmed by two parables, one at the close of the Gospel
before us, <span id="fr_6117"></span>[6118](#fn_6117) and one from the
Gospel according to Luke. <span id="fr_6118"></span>[6119](#fn_6118)  
And not to prolong the discussion by quoting the very letter, as any one
who wishes can take it from the Scripture himself, we will say that the
parable according to Matthew declares, “For it is as when a man going
into another country called his own servants, and delivered unto them
his own goods, and to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and
to another one talent;” <span id="fr_6119"></span>[6120](#fn_6119) then
they took action with regard to that which had been entrusted to them,
and, after a long time, the lord of those servants cometh, and it is
written in the very words, that he also makes a reckoning with
them. <span id="fr_6120"></span>[6121](#fn_6120)   And compare the
words, “And when he began to make a reckoning,” <span
id="fr_6121"></span>[6122](#fn_6121) and consider that he called the
going of the householder into another country the time at which “we are
at home in the body but absent from the Lord;” <span
id="fr_6122"></span>[6123](#fn_6122) but his advent, when, “after a long
time the lord of those servants cometh,” <span
id="fr_6123"></span>[6124](#fn_6123) the time at the consummation in the
judgment; for after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and
makes a reckoning with them, and those things which follow take place. 
But the parable in Luke represents with more clearness, that “a certain
nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and
to return,” and when going, “he called ten servants, and gave to them
ten pounds, and said unto them, Trade ye till I come.” <span
id="fr_6124"></span>[6125](#fn_6124)   But the nobleman, being hated by
his own citizens, who sent an ambassage after him, as they did not wish
him to reign over them, came back again, having received the kingdom,
and told the servants to whom he had given the money to be called to
himself that he might know what they had gained by trading.  And, seeing
what they had done, to him who had made the one pound ten pounds,
rendering praise in the words, “Well done, thou good servant, because
thou wast found faithful in a very little,” <span
id="fr_6125"></span>[6126](#fn_6125) he gives to him authority over ten
cities, to-wit, those which were under his kingdom.  And to another, who
had multiplied the pound fivefold, he did not <span id="page_503">p.
503</span> <span id="xvi.ii.vii.xii-Page_503"></span>render the praise
which he assigned to the first, nor did he specify the word “authority,”
as in the case of the first, but said to him, “Be thou also over five
cities.” <span id="fr_6126"></span>[6127](#fn_6126)   But to him who had
tied up the pound in a napkin, he said, “Out of thine own mouth will I
judge thee, thou wicked servant;” <span
id="fr_6127"></span>[6128](#fn_6127) and he said to them that stood by,
Take from him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten
pounds. <span id="fr_6128"></span>[6129](#fn_6128)   Who, then, in
regard to this parable, will not say that the nobleman, who goes into a
far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return, is Christ,
going, as it were, into another country to receive the kingdoms of this
world, and the things in it?  And those who have received the ten
talents are those who have been entrusted with the dispensation of the
Word which has been committed unto them.  And His citizens who did not
wish Him to reign over them when He was a citizen in the world in
respect of His incarnation, <span id="fr_6129"></span>[6130](#fn_6129)
are perhaps Israel who disbelieved Him, and perhaps also the Gentiles
who disbelieved Him.
