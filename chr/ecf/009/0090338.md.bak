<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>23.  The Temple Spoken of by Christ is
the Church.  Application to the Church of the Statements Regarding the
Building of Solomon’s Temple, and the Numbers Stated in that
Narrative.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxiii-p2"></span>“But He spake of the temple of His
body. <span id="fr_5115"></span>[5116](#fn_5115.md)   When, therefore, He
was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this,
and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.” 
This refers to the statement that the body of the Son is His temple.  It
may be asked whether this is to be taken in its plain sense, or whether
we should try to connect each statement that is recorded about the
temple, with the view we take about the body of Jesus, whether the body
which He received from the Virgin, or that body of Christ which the
Church is said to be, as we are said by the Apostle <span
id="fr_5116"></span>[5117](#fn_5116.md) to be all members of His body.  One
may, on the one hand, suppose it to be hopeless to get everything that
is said about the temple properly connected with the body, in whatever
sense the body be taken, and one may have recourse to a simpler
explanation, and say that the body (in either of these senses) is called
the temple, because as the temple had the glory of God dwelling in it,
so He who was the image and glory of God, the first-born of every
creature, could rightly be called, in respect of His body or the Church,
the temple containing the image.  We, for our part, see it to be a hard
task to expound every particular of what is said about the temple in the
third Book of Kings, and far beyond our powers of language, and we defer
it in the meantime, as a thing beyond the scale of the present work.  We
also <span id="page_404">p. 404</span> <span
id="xv.iii.vi.xxiii-Page_404"></span>have a strong conviction that in
such matters, which transcend human nature, it must be the work of
divine wisdom to make plain the meaning of inspired Scripture, of that
wisdom which is hidden in a mystery, which none of the rulers of this
world knew.  We are well aware, too, that we need the assistance of that
excellent Spirit of wisdom, in order to understand such matters, as they
should be understood by ministers of sacred things; and in this
connection we will attempt to describe, as shortly as we may, our view
of what belongs to this subject.  The body is the Church, and we learn
from Peter <span id="fr_5117"></span>[5118](#fn_5117.md) that it is a house
of God, built of living stones, a spiritual house for a holy
priesthood.  Thus the son of David, who builds this house, is a type of
Christ.  He builds it when his wars are at an end, <span
id="fr_5118"></span>[5119](#fn_5118.md) and a period of profound peace has
arrived; he builds the temple for the glory of God in the Jerusalem on
earth, so that worship may no longer be celebrated in a moveable
erection like the tabernacle.  Let us seek to find in the Church the
truth of each statement made about the temple.  If all Christ’s enemies
are made the footstool of His feet, <span
id="fr_5119"></span>[5120](#fn_5119.md) and Death, the last enemy, is
destroyed, then there will be the most perfect peace.  Christ will be
Solomon, which means “Peaceful,” <span
id="fr_5120"></span>[5121](#fn_5120.md) and the prophecy will find its
fulfilment in Him, which says, <span
id="fr_5121"></span>[5122](#fn_5121.md) “With those who hated peace I was
peaceful.”  And then each of the living stones will be, according to the
work of his life here, a stone of that temple, one, at the foundation,
an apostle or a prophet, bearing those placed upon him, and another,
after those in the foundation, and supported by the Apostles, will
himself, with the Apostles, help to bear those in more need.  One will
be a stone of the inmost parts, where the ark is, and the cherubim, and
the mercy-seat; another will be on the outer wall, and another even
outside the outer wall of the levites and priests, a stone of the altar
of whole burnt offerings.  And the management and service of these
things will be entrusted to holy powers, angels of God, being,
respectively, lordships, thrones, dominions, or powers; and there will
be others subject to these, typified by three thousand six hundred <span
id="fr_5122"></span>[5123](#fn_5122.md) chief officers, who were appointed
over the works of Solomon, and the seventy thousand of those who bore
burdens, and the eighty thousand stone-cutters in the mountain, who
wrought in the work, and prepared the stones and the wood.  It is to be
remarked that those reported as bearing burdens are related to the
Hebdomad.  The quarrymen and stone-cutters, who make the stones fitted
for the temple, have some kinship to the ogdoad.  And the officers, who
are six hundred in number, are connected with the perfect number six
multiplied into itself.  The preparation of the stones, as they are
taken out and fitted for the building, extends over three years; this
appears to me to point solely to the time of the eternal interval which
is akin to the triad.  This will come to pass when peace is consummated
after the number of years of the transaction of the matters connected
with the exodus from Egypt, namely, three hundred and forty, and of what
took place in Egypt four hundred and thirty years after the covenant
made by God with Abraham.  Thus, from Abraham to the beginning of the
building of the temple, there are two sabbatic numbers, the 700 and the
70; and at that time, too, our King Christ will command the seventy
thousand burden-bearers not to take any chance stones for the foundation
of the temple, but great stones, precious, unhewn, that they may be
hewn, not by any chance workmen, but by the sons of Solomon; for so we
find it written in the third Book of Kings.  Then, too, on account of
the profound peace, Hiram, king of Tyre, cooperates in the building of
the temple, and gives his own sons to the sons of Solomon, to hew, in
company with them, the great and precious stones for the holy place,
which, in the fourth year, are placed in the foundation of the house of
the Lord.  But in an ogdoad of years the house is finished in the eighth
month of the eighth year after its foundation.
