<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Section XXVI.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p2"></span>\[1, 2\]  <span
id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806.md) And there came unto him publicans
and sinners to hear his word.   <span
id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807.md) And the scribes and the Pharisees
murmured, and said, This man receiveth sinners, and \[3\] eateth with
them.   <span id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808.md) And Jesus, when he
beheld their murmuring, spake unto them \[4\] this parable:   <span
id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809.md) What man of you, having an hundred
sheep, if one of them were lost, would not leave the ninety-nine in the
wilderness, and go and seek the straying *one* \[5\] till he found it? 
 <span id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810.md) Verily I say unto you, When
he findeth it, he will rejoice over it \[6\] more than *over* the
ninety-nine that went not astray;  <span
id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811.md) and bear it on his shoulders, and
bring it to his house, and call his friends and neighbours,  <span
id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812.md) and say unto them, \[7\] Rejoice
with me, since I have found my straying sheep.   <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813.md) So your Father which is in heaven
willeth <span id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814.md) not that one of these
little ones that have strayed should perish, \[8\] and he seeketh for
them repentance.   <span id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815.md) I say unto
you, Thus there shall be rejoicing in heaven over one sinner that
repenteth, more than *over* ninety-nine righteous persons that do not
need repentance.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p13"></span>\[9\]  <span
id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816.md) And what woman having ten drachmas
would lose one of them, and not light a \[10\] lamp, and sweep the
house, and seek it with care till she found it;  <span
id="fr_1817"></span>[1818](#fn_1817.md) and when she found it, call her
friends and neighbours, and say unto them, Rejoice with me, as I \[11\]
have found my drachma that was lost?   <span
id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818.md) I say unto you, Thus there shall be
joy \[Arabic, p. 101\] before the angels of God over the one sinner that
repenteth, more than over the ninety-nine righteous *persons* that do
not need repentance.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p17"></span>\[12, 13\]  <span
id="fr_1819"></span>[1820](#fn_1819.md) And Jesus spake unto them also
another parable:   <span id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820.md) A man had
two sons:  and the younger son said unto him, My father, give me my
portion that belongeth to \[14\] me of thy goods.   <span
id="fr_1821"></span>[1822](#fn_1821.md) And he divided between them his
property.  And after a few days the younger son gathered everything that
belonged to him, and went into a \[15\] far country, and there
squandered his property by living prodigally.   <span
id="fr_1822"></span>[1823](#fn_1822.md) And when he <span id="page_84">p.
84</span> <span id="iv.iii.xxvi-Page_84"></span>had exhausted everything
he had, there occurred a great dearth in that country.  \[16\]  <span
id="fr_1823"></span>[1824](#fn_1823.md) And when he was in want, he went
and joined himself to one of the people of a city \[17\] of that
country; and that *man* sent him into the field <span
id="fr_1824"></span>[1825](#fn_1824.md) to feed the swine.   <span
id="fr_1825"></span>[1826](#fn_1825.md) And he used to long to fill his
belly with the carob that those swine were eating:  and no man \[18\]
gave him.   <span id="fr_1826"></span>[1827](#fn_1826.md) And when he
returned unto himself, he said, How many hired servants now in my
father’s house have bread enough and to spare, while I here perish with
\[19\] hunger!   <span id="fr_1827"></span>[1828](#fn_1827.md) I will arise
and go to my father’s house, and say unto him, My father,  <span
id="fr_1828"></span>[1829](#fn_1828.md) I \[20\] have sinned in heaven and
before thee, and am not worthy now to be called thy \[21\] son:  make me
as one of thy hired servants.   <span
id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829.md) And he arose, and came to his
father.  But his father saw him while he was at a distance, and was
moved with compassion \[22\] for him, and ran, <span
id="fr_1830"></span>[1831](#fn_1830.md) and fell on his breast, <span
id="fr_1831"></span>[1832](#fn_1831.md) and kissed him.   <span
id="fr_1832"></span>[1833](#fn_1832.md) And his son said unto him, My
father, I have sinned in heaven and before thee, and am not worthy to be
\[23\] called thy son.   <span id="fr_1833"></span>[1834](#fn_1833.md) His
father said unto his servants, Bring forth a stately robe, and put
\[24\] *it* on him; and put a ring on his hand, and put on him shoes on
his feet:   <span id="fr_1834"></span>[1835](#fn_1834.md) and bring and
\[25\] slay a fatted ox, that we may eat and make merry:   <span
id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835.md) for this my son was dead, and is
\[26\] \[Arabic, p. 102\] alive; and was lost, and is found.   <span
id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836.md) And they began to be merry. <span
id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837.md)   Now his elder son was in the
field; and when he came and drew near to the house, \[27\] he heard the
sound of many singing. <span id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838.md)  
 <span id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839.md) And he called one of the
lads, and asked him \[28\] what this was.   <span
id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840.md) He said unto him, Thy brother hath
arrived; and thy father hath \[29\] slain a fatted ox, since he hath
received him safe and sound. <span id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841.md)
   <span id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842.md) And he was angry, \[30\]
and would not enter; so his father went out, and besought him to enter. 
 <span id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843.md) And he said to his father,
How many years do I serve thee in bondage, and I never transgressed a
commandment of thine; and thou hast never given me a kid, that I might
\[31\] make merry with my friends?  <span
id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844.md) but this thy son, when he had
squandered thy \[32\] property with harlots, and come, thou hast slain
for him a fatted ox.   <span id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845.md) His
father said unto him, My son, thou art at all times with me, and
everything I have is \[33\] thine.   <span
id="fr_1846"></span>[1847](#fn_1846.md) It behoveth thee to rejoice and
make merry, since this thy brother was dead, and is alive; and *was*
lost, and is found.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p46"></span>\[34\]  <span
id="fr_1847"></span>[1848](#fn_1847.md) And he spake a parable unto his
disciples:  There was a rich man, and he had \[35\] a steward; and he
was accused to him that he had squandered his property.   <span
id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848.md) So his lord called him, and said
unto him, What is this that I hear regarding thee?  Give me the account
of thy stewardship; for it is now impossible that thou shouldest \[36\]
be a steward for me.   <span id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849.md) The
steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh
from me the stewardship?  To dig I am not able; and to beg <span
id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850.md) I \[37\] am ashamed.   <span
id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851.md) I know what I will do, that, when I
go out of the stewardship, they \[38\] may receive me into their
houses.   <span id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md) And he called one
after another of his lord’s \[39\] debtors, and said to the first, How
much owest thou my lord?   <span id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md) He
said unto him, An hundred portions <span
id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854.md) of oil.  He said unto him, Take thy
writing, and sit down, and write \[40\] quickly fifty portions. <span
id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md)    <span
id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) And he said to the next, And thou,
how much owest thou my lord?  He said unto him, An hundred cors of
wheat.  He said unto him, Take \[41\] \[Arabic, p. 103\] thy writing,
and sit down, and write eighty cors.   <span
id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) And our <span
id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) lord commended the sinful
steward <span id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md) because he had done a
wise deed; for the children \[42\] of this world are wiser than the
children of the light in this their age.   <span
id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md) And I also say unto you, Make unto
yourselves friends with the wealth of this unrighteousness; <span
id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md) \[43\] so that, when it is
exhausted, they may receive you into their tents for ever.   <span
id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) He who is faithful in <span
id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md) a little is faithful also in much: 
and he who is unrighteous in a \[44\] little is unrighteous also in
much.   <span id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) If then in the wealth
of unrighteousness ye were \[45\] not trustworthy, who will intrust you
with the truth? <span id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865.md)    <span
id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md) If ye are not found faithful in
what does not belong to you, who will give you what belongeth to you?
