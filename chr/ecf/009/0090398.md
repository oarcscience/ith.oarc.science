<span id="xvi.ii.v.i-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.i-p1.1"></span>Book XII.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.i-p2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.i-p2.1"></span>1.  Concerning Those Who Asked Him to Show
Them a Sign from Heaven.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.i-p3"></span>“*And the Sadducees and Pharisees came,
and tempting Him kept asking Him to shew them a sign from
heaven.*” <span id="fr_5552"></span>[5553](#fn_5552)   The Sadducees and
Pharisees who disagreed with each other in regard to the most essential
truths,—for the Pharisees champion the doctrine of the resurrection of
the dead, hoping that there will be a world to come, while the Sadducees
know nothing after this life in store for a man whether he has been
advancing towards virtue, or has made no effort at all to come out from
the mountains of wickedness,—these, I say, agree that they may tempt
Jesus.  Now, a similar thing, as Luke has narrated, <span
id="fr_5553"></span>[5554](#fn_5553) happened in the case of Herod and
Pilate, who became friends with one another that they might kill Jesus;
for, perhaps, their hostility with one another would have prevented
Herod from asking that He should be put to death, in order to please the
people, who said, “Crucify Him, Crucify Him,” <span
id="fr_5554"></span>[5555](#fn_5554) and would have influenced Pilate,
who was somewhat inclined against His condemnation, his hostility with
Herod giving fresh impulse to the inclination which he previously
cherished to release Jesus.  But their apparent friendship made Herod
stronger in <span id="page_450">p. 450</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.i-Page_450"></span>his demand against Jesus with Pilate,
who wished, perhaps, also because of the newly-formed friendship to do
something to gratify Herod and all the nation of the Jews.  And often
even now you may see in daily life those who hold the most divergent
opinions, whether in the philosophy of the Greeks or in other systems of
thought, appearing to be of one mind that they may scoff at and attack
Jesus Christ in the person of His disciples.  And from these things I
think you may go on by rational argument to consider, whether when
forces join in opposition which are in disagreement with one another, as
of Pharaoh with Nebuchadnezzar, <span
id="fr_5555"></span>[5556](#fn_5555) and of Tirhakah, king of the
Ethiopians, with Sennacherib, <span id="fr_5556"></span>[5557](#fn_5556)
a combination then takes place against Jesus and His people.  So
perhaps, also, “The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers
were gathered together,” <span id="fr_5557"></span>[5558](#fn_5557)
though not at all before at harmony with one another, that having taken
counsel against the Lord and His Christ, they might slay the Lord of
glory.
