<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xiii-p1.1"></span>13.  No Forgiveness to the
Unforgiving.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xiii-p2"></span>Only, I have said these things with
the view of referring his return when he comes with his kingdom to the
consummation, when he commanded the servants to whom he had given the
money to be called to him that he might know what they had gained by
trading, and from a desire to demonstrate from this, and from the
parable of the Talents, that the passage “he who wished to make a
reckoning with his own servants” <span
id="fr_6130"></span>[6131](#fn_6130) is to be referred to the
consummation when now he is king, receiving the kingdom, on account of
which, according to another parable, <span
id="fr_6131"></span>[6132](#fn_6131) he went into a far country, to
receive for himself a kingdom and to return.  Therefore, when he
returned after receiving the kingdom, he wished to make a reckoning with
his own servants.  And “when he had begun to reckon, there was brought
unto him one who owed many talents,” <span
id="fr_6132"></span>[6133](#fn_6132) and he was brought as to a king by
those who had been appointed his ministers—I think, the angels.  And
perhaps he was one of those under the kingdom who had been entrusted
with a great administration and had not dispensed it well, but had
wasted what had been entrusted to him, so that he came to owe the many
talents which he had lost.  This very man, perhaps not having the means
to pay, is ordered by the king to be sold along with his wife, by
intercourse with whom he became the father of certain children.  But it
is no easy task to see what is intellectually meant by father and mother
and children.  What this means in point of truth God may know, and
whether He Himself has given insight to us or not, he who can may
judge.  Only this is our conception of the passage; that, as “the
Jerusalem which is above” is “the mother” <span
id="fr_6133"></span>[6134](#fn_6133) of Paul and of those like unto him,
so there may be a mother of others after the analogy of Jerusalem, the
mother, for example, of Syene in Egypt, or Sidon, or as many cities as
are named in the Scriptures.  Then, as Jerusalem is “a bride adorned for
her husband,” <span id="fr_6134"></span>[6135](#fn_6134) Christ, so
there may be those mothers of certain powers who have been allotted to
them as wives or brides.  And as there are certain children of
Jerusalem, as mother, and of Christ, as father, so there would be
certain children of Syene, or Memphis, or Tyre, or Sidon, and the rulers
set over them.  Perhaps then, too, this one, the debtor of many talents
who was brought to the king, has, as we have said, a wife and children,
whom at first the king ordered to be sold, and also all that he had to
be sold; but afterwards, being moved with compassion, he released him
and forgave him all the debt; not, as if he were ignorant of the future,
but, in order that we might understand what happened, it was written
that he did so.  Each one then of those who have, as we have said, a
wife and children will render an account whenever the king comes to make
a reckoning, having received the kingdom and having returned; and each
of them as a ruler of any Syene or Memphis, or Tyre or Sidon, or any
like unto them, has also debtors.  This one, then, having been released,
and having been forgiven all the debt, “went out from the king and found
one of his fellow-servants,” <span id="fr_6135"></span>[6136](#fn_6135)
etc.; and, on this account, I suppose that he took him by the throat,
when he had gone out from the king, for unless he had gone out he would
not have taken his own fellow-servant by the throat.  Then observe the
accuracy of the Scripture, how that the one fell down and “worshipped,”
but the other fell down and did not worship but “besought;” <span
id="fr_6136"></span>[6137](#fn_6136) and the king being moved with
compassion released him and forgave him all the debt, but the servant
did not wish even to pity his own fellow-servant; and the king before
his release ordered him to be sold and what was his, while he who had
been forgiven <span id="page_504">p. 504</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xiii-Page_504"></span>cast him into prison.  And observe
that his fellow-servants did not bring any accusation or “said,” but
“told,” <span id="fr_6137"></span>[6138](#fn_6137) and that he did not
use the epithet “wicked” at the beginning in regard to the money lost,
but reserved it afterwards for his action towards the fellow-servant. 
But mark also the moderation of the king; he does not say, You
worshipped me, but You besought me; and no longer did he order him and
his to be sold, but, what was worse, he delivered him to the tormentors,
because of his wickedness. <span id="fr_6138"></span>[6139](#fn_6138)  
But who may these be but those who have been appointed in the matter of
punishments?  But at the same time observe, because of the use made of
this parable by adherents of heresies, that if they accuse the
Creator <span id="fr_6139"></span>[6140](#fn_6139) of being passionate,
because of words that declare the wrath of God, they ought also to
accuse this king, because that “being wroth,” he delivered the debtor to
the tormentors.  But it must further be said to those whose view it is
that no one is delivered by Jesus to the tormentors,—pray, explain to
us, good sirs, who is the king who delivered the wicked servant to the
tormentors?  And let them also attend to this, “So therefore also shall
My heavenly Father do unto you;” <span
id="fr_6140"></span>[6141](#fn_6140) and to the same persons also might
rather be said the things in the parable of the Ten Pounds that the Son
of the good God said, “Howbeit these mine enemies which would not that I
should reign over them,” <span id="fr_6141"></span>[6142](#fn_6141)
etc.  The conclusion of the parable, however, is adapted also to the
simpler; for all of us who have obtained the forgiveness of our own
sins, and have not forgiven our brethren, are taught at once that we
shall suffer the lot of him who was forgiven but did not forgive his
fellow-servant.
