<p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.ii.xxii-p2"></A>Should any one consider that we are adding something that is not written, namely, the pursuit of the light by the darkness, let him reflect that unless the darkness had pursued the light the words, &#8220;The darkness did not overtake it,&#8221; would have no meaning.&#160; John writes for those who have wit to see what is omitted and to supply it as the context requires, and so he wrote, &#8220;The darkness did not overtake it.&#8221;&#160; If it did not overtake it, it must first have pursued it, <A NAME="page_339"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 339</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iii.ii.xxii-Page_339"></A>and that the darkness did pursue the light is clear from what the Saviour suffered, and those also who received His teachings, His own children, when darkness was doing what it could against the sons of light and was minded to drive light away from men.&#160; But since, if God be for us,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4742"></A><A HREF="#fn_4742"><FONT SIZE="1">4743</FONT></A>
 no one, however that way minded, can be against us, the more they humbled themselves the more they grew, and they prevailed exceedingly.&#160; In two ways the darkness did not overtake the light.&#160; Either it was left far behind and was itself so slow, while the light was in its course so sharp and swift, that it was not even able to keep following it, or if the light sought to lay a snare for the darkness, and waited for it in pursuance of the plan it had formed, then darkness, coming near the light, was brought to an end.&#160; In either case the darkness did not overtake the light.</p>
