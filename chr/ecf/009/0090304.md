<span id="xv.iii.v.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.xxviii-p1.1"></span>28.  Naaman the Syrian and the Jordan. 
No Other Stream Has the Same Healing Power.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxviii-p2"></span>Should any one object to the
expression “He smote the water,” on account of the conclusion we arrived
at above with respect to the Jordan, that it is a type of the Word who
descended for us our descending, we rejoin that with the Apostle the
rock is plainly said to be Christ, and that it is <span id="page_374">p.
374</span> <span id="xv.iii.v.xxviii-Page_374"></span>smitten twice with
the rod, so that the people may drink of the spiritual rock which
follows them.  The “smiting” in this new difficulty is that of those who
are fond of suggesting something that contradicts the conclusion even
before they have learned what the question is which is in hand.  From
such God sets us free, since, on the one hand, He gives us to drink when
we are thirsty, and on the other He prepares for us, in the immense and
trackless deep, a road to pass over, namely, by the dividing of His
Word, since it is by the reason which distinguishes (divides) that most
things are made plain to us.  But that we may receive the right
interpretation about this Jordan, so good to drink, so full of grace, it
may be of use to compare the cleansing of Naaman the Syrian from his
leprosy, and what is said of the rivers of religion of the enemies of
Israel.  It is recorded of Naaman <span
id="fr_4942"></span>[4943](#fn_4942) that he came with horse and
chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.  And Elisha sent
a messenger to him, saying, “Go, wash seven times in the Jordan, and thy
flesh shall come again unto thee, and thou shalt be cleansed.”  Then
Naaman is angry; he does not see that our Jordan is the cleanser of
those who are impure from leprosy, from that impurity, and their
restorer to health; it is the Jordan that does this, and not the
prophet; the office of the prophet is to direct to the healing agency. 
Naaman then says, not understanding the great mystery of the Jordan,
“Behold, I said that he will certainly come out to me, and will call
upon the name of the Lord his God, and lay his hand upon the place, and
restore the leper.”  For to put his hand on the leprosy <span
id="fr_4943"></span>[4944](#fn_4943) and cleanse it is a work belonging
to our Lord Jesus only; for when the leper appealed to Him with faith,
saying, “If Thou wilt Thou canst make me clean,” He not only said, “I
will, be thou clean,” but in addition to the word He touched him, and he
was cleansed from his leprosy.  Naaman, then, is still in error, and
does not see how far inferior other rivers are to the Jordan for the
cure of the suffering; he extols the rivers of Damascus, Arbana, and
Pharpha, saying, “Are not Arbana and Pharpha, rivers of Damascus, better
than all the waters of Israel?  Shall I not wash in them and be clean?” 
For as none is good <span id="fr_4944"></span>[4945](#fn_4944) but one,
God the Father, so among rivers none is good but the Jordan, nor able to
cleanse from his leprosy him who with faith washes his soul in Jesus. 
And this, I suppose, is the reason why the Israelites are recorded to
have wept when they sat by the rivers of Babylon and remembered Zion;
those who are carried captive, on account of their wickedness, when they
taste other waters after sacred Jordan, are led to remember with longing
their own river of salvation.  Therefore it is said of the rivers of
Babylon, “There we sat down,” clearly because they were unable to stand,
“and wept.”  And Jeremiah rebukes those who wish to drink the waters of
Egypt, and desert the water which comes down from heaven, and is named
from its so coming down—namely, the Jordan.  He says, <span
id="fr_4945"></span>[4946](#fn_4945) “What hast thou to do with the way
of Egypt, to drink the water of Geon, and to drink the water of the
river,” or, as it is in the Hebrew, “to drink the water of Sion.”  Of
which water we have now to speak.
