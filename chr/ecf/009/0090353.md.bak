<span id="xvi.ii.iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>2.  Exposition of the Parable.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.ii-p2"></span>“*After these things He answered and
said to them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man.*” <span
id="fr_5163"></span>[5164](#fn_5163.md)   Though we have already, in
previous sections, according to our ability discussed these matters,
none the less shall we now say what is in harmony with them, even if
there is reasonable ground for another explanation.  And consider now,
if in addition to what we have already recounted, you can otherwise take
the good seed to be the children of the kingdom, because whatsoever good
things are sown in the human soul, these are the offspring of the
kingdom of God and have been sown by God the Word who was in the
beginning with God, <span id="fr_5164"></span>[5165](#fn_5164.md) so that
wholesome words about anything are children of the kingdom.  But while
men are asleep who do not act according to the command of Jesus, “Watch
and pray that ye enter not into temptation,” <span
id="fr_5165"></span>[5166](#fn_5165.md) the devil on the watch sows what
are called tares—that is, evil opinions—over and among what are called
by some natural conceptions, even the good seeds which are from the
Word.  And according to this the whole world might be called a field,
and not the Church of God only, for in the whole world the Son of man
sowed the good seed, but the wicked one tares,—that is, evil
words,—which, springing from wickedness, are children of the evil one. 
And at the end of things, which is called “the consummation of the
age,” <span id="fr_5166"></span>[5167](#fn_5166.md) there will of necessity
be a harvest, in order that the angels of God who have been appointed
for this work may gather up the bad opinions that have grown upon the
soul, and overturning them may give them over to fire which is said to
burn, that they may be consumed.  And so the angels and servants of the
Word will gather from all the kingdom of Christ all things that cause a
<span id="page_415">p. 415</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.ii-Page_415"></span>stumbling-block to souls and
reasonings that create iniquity, which they will scatter and cast into
the burning furnace of fire.  Then those who become conscious that they
have received the seeds of the evil one in themselves, because of their
having been asleep, shall wail and, as it were, be angry against
themselves; for this is the “gnashing of teeth.” <span
id="fr_5167"></span>[5168](#fn_5167.md)   Wherefore, also, in the Psalms it
is said, “They gnashed upon me with their teeth.” <span
id="fr_5168"></span>[5169](#fn_5168.md)   Then above all “shall the
righteous shine,” no longer differently as at the first, but all “as one
sun in the kingdom of their Father.” <span
id="fr_5169"></span>[5170](#fn_5169.md)   Then, as if to indicate that
there was indeed a hidden meaning, perhaps, in all that is concerned
with the explanation of the parable, perhaps most of all in the saying,
“Then shall the righteous shine as the sun in the kingdom of their
Father,” the Saviour adds, “He that hath ears to hear, let him
hear,” <span id="fr_5170"></span>[5171](#fn_5170.md) thereby teaching those
who think that in the exposition, the parable has been set forth with
such perfect clearness that it can be understood by the vulgar, <span
id="fr_5171"></span>[5172](#fn_5171.md) that even the things connected with
the interpretation of the parable stand in need of explanation.
