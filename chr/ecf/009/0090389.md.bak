<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>12.  Things Clean and Unclean According
to the Law and the Gospel.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xii-p2"></span>“*And He called to Him the multitude
and said unto them, Hear and understand,* ” etc. <span
id="fr_5431"></span>[5432](#fn_5431.md)   We are clearly taught in these
words by the Saviour that, when we read in Leviticus and Deuteronomy the
precepts about meat clean and unclean, for the transgression of which we
are accused by the material Jews and by the Ebionites who differ little
from them, we are not to think that the scope of the Scripture is found
in any superficial understanding of them.  For if “not that which
entereth into the mouth defileth the man, but that which proceedeth out
of the mouth,” <span id="fr_5432"></span>[5433](#fn_5432.md) and especially
when, according to Mark, the Saviour said these things “making all meats
clean,” <span id="fr_5433"></span>[5434](#fn_5433.md) manifestly we are not
defiled when we eat those things which the Jews who desire to be in
bondage to the letter of the law declare to be unclean, but we are then
defiled when, whereas our lips ought to be bound with perception and we
ought “to make for them what we call a balance and weight,” <span
id="fr_5434"></span>[5435](#fn_5434.md) we speak offhand and discuss
matters we ought not, from which there comes to us the spring of sins. 
And it is indeed becoming to the law of God to forbid those things which
arise from wickedness, and to enjoin those things which tend to virtue,
but as for things which are in their own nature indifferent to leave
them in their own place, as they may, according to our choice and the
reason which is in us, be done ill if we sin in them, but if rightly
directed by us be done well.  And any one who has carefully thought on
these matters will see that, even in those things which are thought to
be good, it is possible for a man to sin who has taken them up in an
evil way and under the impulse of passion, and that these things called
impure <span id="page_441">p. 441</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iv.xii-Page_441"></span>may be considered pure, if used by us
in accordance with reason.  As, then, when the Jew sins his circumcision
shall be reckoned for uncircumcision, but when one of the Gentiles acts
uprightly his uncircumcision shall be reckoned for circumcision, <span
id="fr_5435"></span>[5436](#fn_5435.md) so those things which are thought
to be pure shall be reckoned for impure in the case of him who does not
use them fittingly, nor when one ought, nor as far as he ought, nor for
what reason he ought.  But as for the things which are called impure,
“All things become pure to the pure,” for, “To them that are defiled and
unbelieving nothing is pure, since both their minds and their conscience
are defiled.” <span id="fr_5436"></span>[5437](#fn_5436.md)   And when
these are defiled, they make all things whatsoever they touch defiled;
as again on the contrary the pure mind and the pure conscience make all
things pure, even though they may seem to be impure; for not from
intemperance, nor from love of pleasure, nor with doubting which draws a
man both ways, do the righteous use meats or drinks, mindful of the
precept, “Whether ye eat or drink or whatsoever other thing ye do, do
all to the glory of God.” <span id="fr_5437"></span>[5438](#fn_5437.md)  
And if it be necessary to delineate the foods which are unclean
according to the Gospel, we will say that they are such as are supplied
by covetousness, and are the result of base love of gain, and are taken
up from love of pleasure, and from deifying the belly which is treated
with honour, when it, with its appetites, and not reason, rules our
souls.  But as for us who know that some things are used by demons, or
if we do not know, but suspect, and are in doubt about it, if we use
such things, we have used them not to the glory of God, nor in the name
of Christ; for not only does the suspicion that things have been
sacrificed to idols condemn him who eats, but even the doubt concerning
this; for “he that doubteth,” according to the Apostle, “is condemned if
he eat, because he eateth not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith
is sin.” <span id="fr_5438"></span>[5439](#fn_5438.md)   He then eats in
faith who believes that that which is eaten has not been sacrificed in
the temples of idols, and that it is not strangled nor blood; <span
id="fr_5439"></span>[5440](#fn_5439.md) but he eats not of faith who is in
doubt about any of these things.  And the man who knowing that they have
been sacrificed to demons nevertheless uses them, becomes a communicant
with demons, while at the same time, his imagination is polluted with
reference to demons participating in the sacrifice.  And the Apostle,
however, knowing that it is not the nature of meats which is the cause
of injury to him who uses them or of advantage to him who refrains from
their use, but opinions and the reason which is in them, said, “But meat
commendeth us not to God, for neither if we eat are we the better, nor
if we eat not are we the worse.” <span
id="fr_5440"></span>[5441](#fn_5440.md)   And since he knew that those who
have a loftier conception of what things are pure and what impure
according to the law, turning aside from the distinction about the use
of things pure and impure, and superstition, I think, in respect of
things being different, become indifferent to the use of meats, <span
id="fr_5441"></span>[5442](#fn_5441.md) and on this account are condemned
by the Jews as transgressors of law, he said therefore, somewhere, “Let
no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink,” etc., <span
id="fr_5442"></span>[5443](#fn_5442.md) teaching us that the things
according to the letter are a shadow, but that the true thoughts of the
law which are stored up in them are the good things to come, in which
one may find what are the pure spiritual meats of the soul, and what are
the impure foods in false and contradictory words which injure the man
who is nourished in them, “For the law had a shadow of the good things
to come.” <span id="fr_5443"></span>[5444](#fn_5443.md)
