id="xii.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Continuation.  Lot.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xi-p2"></span>On account of his hospitality and
godliness, Lot was saved out of Sodom when all the country round was
punished by means of fire and brimstone, the Lord thus making it
manifest that He does not forsake those that hope in Him, but gives up
such as depart from Him to punishment and torture. <span
id="fr_4054"></span>[4055](#fn_4054)   For Lot’s wife, who went forth
with him, being of a different mind from himself, and not continuing in
agreement with him \[as to the command which had been given them\], was
made an example of, so as to be a pillar of salt unto this day. <span
id="fr_4055"></span>[4056](#fn_4055)   This was done that all might know
that those who are of a double mind, and who distrust the power of God,
bring down judgment on themselves <span
id="fr_4056"></span>[4057](#fn_4056) and become a sign to all succeeding
generations.
