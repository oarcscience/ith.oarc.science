<span id="xv.iii.i.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.ii-p1.1"></span>2.  The 144,000 Sealed in the Apocalypse
are Converts to Christ from the Gentile World.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.ii-p2"></span>These, then, who are sealed on their
foreheads <span id="fr_4457"></span>[4458](#fn_4457.md) from every tribe of
the children of Israel, are a hundred and forty-four thousand in number;
and these hundred and forty-four thousand are afterwards said in John to
have the name of the Lamb and of His Father written on their foreheads,
and to be virgins, not having defiled themselves with women.  What else
could the seal be which is on their foreheads but the name of the Lamb
and the name of His Father?  In both passages their foreheads are said
to have the seal; in one the seal is spoken of, in the other it appears
to contain the letters forming the <span id="page_298">p. 298</span>
<span id="xv.iii.i.ii-Page_298"></span>name of the Lamb, and the name of
His Father.  Now these taken from the tribes are, as we showed before,
the same persons as the virgins.  But the number of believers is small
who belong to Israel according to the flesh; one might venture to assert
that they would not nearly make up the number of a hundred and
forty-four thousand.  It is clear, therefore, that the hundred and
forty-four thousand who have not defiled themselves with women must be
made up of those who have come to the divine word out of the Gentile
world.  In this way the truth of the statement may be upheld that the
first fruits of each tribe are its virgins.  For the passage goes on: 
“These were brought from among men to be a first fruits to God and to
the Lamb; and in their mouth was found no guile, for they are without
blemish.”  The statement about the hundred and forty-four thousand no
doubt admits of mystical interpretation; but it is unnecessary at this
point, and would divert us from our purpose, to compare with it those
passages of the prophets in which the same lesson is taught regarding
those who are called from among the Gentiles.
