id="xvi.ii.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>6.  The Exposition Continued.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.vi-p2"></span>And at this point you will inquire,
whether the kingdom of heaven is likened only to the treasure hidden in
the field, so that we are to think of the field as different from the
kingdom, or is likened to the whole of this treasure hidden in the
field, so that the kingdom of heaven contains according to the
similitude both the field and the treasure hidden in the field.  Now a
man who comes to the field, whether to the Scriptures or to the Christ
who is constituted both from things manifest and from things hidden,
finds the hidden treasure of wisdom whether in Christ or in the
Scriptures.  For, going round to visit the field and searching the
Scriptures and seeking to understand the Christ, he finds the treasure
in it; and, having found it, he hides it, thinking that it is not
without danger to reveal to everybody the secret meanings of the
Scriptures, or the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in Christ.  And,
having hidden it, he goes away, working and devising how he shall buy
the field, or the Scriptures, that he may make them his own possession,
receiving from the people of God the oracles of God with which the Jews
were first entrusted. <span id="fr_5185"></span>[5186](#fn_5185.md)   And
when the man taught by Christ has bought the field, the kingdom of God
which, according to another parable, is a vineyard, “is taken from them
and is given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof,” <span
id="fr_5186"></span>[5187](#fn_5186.md) —to him who in faith has bought the
field, as the fruit of his having sold all that he had, and no longer
keeping by him anything that was formerly his; for they were a source of
evil to him.  And you will give the same application, if the field
containing the hidden treasure be Christ, for those who give up all
things and follow Him, have, as it were in another way, sold their
possessions, in order that, by having sold and surrendered them, and
having received in their place from God—their helper—a noble resolution,
they may purchase, at great cost worthy of the field, the field
containing the treasure hidden in itself.
