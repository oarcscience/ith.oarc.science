<span id="ii.ii-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="ii.ii-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="ii.ii-p3.1"></span>This</span> volume of the series of Nicene
Fathers has been unfortunately delayed. When I consented in the first
instance to edit the volume, it was with the distinct understanding that
I could not myself undertake the translation, but that I would do my
best to find translators and see the work through the press. It has been
several times placed in the hands of very competent scholars; but the
fact that work of this kind can only be done in the intervals of regular
duties, and the almost inevitable drawback that the best men are also
the busiest, has repeatedly stood in the way and caused the work to be
returned to me. That it sees the light now is due mainly to the zeal,
ability, and scholarship of the Rev. E. W. Watson. It was late in the
day when Mr. Watson first undertook a share in the work which has since
then been constantly increased. He has co-operated with me in the most
loyal and efficient manner; and while I am glad to think that the whole
of the Introduction and a full half of the translation are from his
hand, there is hardly a page (except in the translation of the *De
Synodis*, which was complete before he joined the work) which does not
owe to him many and marked improvements. My own personal debt to Mr.
Watson is very great indeed, and that of the subscribers to the series
is, I believe, hardly less.

<span id="ii.ii-p4"></span>For the translator of Hilary has before him a
very difficult task. It has not been with this as with other volumes of
the series, where an excellent translation already existed and careful
revision was all that was needed. A small beginning had been made for
the *De Trinitate* by the late Dr. Short, Bishop of Adelaide, whose
manuscript was kindly lent to one of the contributors to this volume.
But with this exception no English translation of Hilary’s works has
been hitherto attempted. That which is now offered is the first in the
field. And it must be confessed that Hilary is a formidable writer. I do
not think that I know any Latin writer so formidable, unless it is
Victorinus Afer, or Tertullian. And the terse, vigorous, incisive
sentences of Tertullian, when once the obscurities of meaning have been
mastered, run more easily into English than the involved and overloaded
periods of Hilary. It is true that in a period of decline Hilary
preserves more than most of his contemporaries of the tradition of Roman
culture; but it is the culture of the rhetorical schools at almost the
extreme point of their artificiality and mannerism. Hilary was too
sincere a man and too thoroughly in earnest to be essentially mannered
or artificial; but his training had taken too strong a hold upon him to
allow him to express his thought with ease and simplicity. And his very
merits all tended in the same direction. He has the *copia verborum*; he
has the weight and force of character which naturally goes with a
certain amplitude of style; he has the seriousness and depth of
conviction which keeps him at a high level of dignity and gravity but is
unrelieved by lighter touches.

<span id="ii.ii-p5"></span><span id="page_VI">p. VI</span> <span
id="ii.ii-Page_VI"></span>We must take our author as we find him. But it
seems to me, if I am not mistaken, that Mr. Watson has performed a real
feat of translation in not only reproducing the meaning of the original
but giving to it an English rendering which is so readable, flowing, and
even elegant. I think it will be allowed that only a natural feeling for
the rhythm and cadence of English speech, as well as for its varied
harmonies of diction, could have produced the result which is now laid
before the reader. And I cherish the hope, that although different
degrees of success have doubtless been attained by the different
contributors at least no jarring discrepancy of style will be felt
throughout the volume. It will be seen that the style generally leans to
the side of freedom; but I believe that it will be found to be the
freedom of the scholar who is really true to his text while transfusing
it into another tongue, and not the clumsy approximation which only
means failure.

<span id="ii.ii-p6"></span>Few writers deserve their place in the
library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers more thoroughly than Hilary.
He might be said to be the one Latin theologian before the age of St.
Augustine and St. Leo. Tertullian had a still greater influence upon the
writers who followed him. He came at a still more formative and critical
time, and the *vis vivida* of his original and wayward genius has rarely
been equalled. But the particular influence which Tertullian exerted in
coining the terms and marking out the main lines of Latin theology came
to him almost by accident. He was primarily a lawyer, and his special
gift did not lie in the region of speculation. It is a strange fortune
which gave to the language on which he set his stamp so great a control
of the future. The influence of Hilary on the other hand is his by
right. His intercourse with the East had a marked effect upon him. It
quickened a natural bent for speculation unusual in the West. The reader
will find in Mr. Watson’s Introduction a description and estimate of
Hilary’s theology which is in my opinion at once accurate, candid and
judicious. No attempt is made to gloss over the defects, especially in
what we might call the more superficial exegesis of Hilary’s argument;
but behind and beneath this we feel that we are in contact with a very
powerful mind. We feel that we are in contact with a mind that has
seized and holds fast the central truth of the Christian system, which
at that particular crisis of the Church’s history was gravely imperiled.
The nerve of all Hilary’s thinking lies in his belief, a belief to which
he clung more tenaciously than to life itself, that Christ was the Son
of God not in name and metaphor only, but in fullest and deepest
reality. The great Athanasius himself has not given to this belief a
more impressive or more weighty expression. And when like assaults come
round, as they are constantly doing, in what is in many respects the
inferior arena of our own day, it is both morally bracing and
intellectually helpful to go back to these protagonists of the elder
time.

<span id="ii.ii-p7"></span>And yet, although Hilary is thus one of the
chief builders up of a metaphysical theology in the West—although, in
other words, he stands upon the direct line of the origin of the
*Quicumque vult*, it is well to remember that no one could be more
conscious than he was of the inadequacy of human thought and human
language to deal with these high matters. The accusation of intruding
with a light heart into mysteries is very far from touching him. “The
heretics compel us to speak where we would far rather be silent. If
anything is said, this is what must be said,” is his constant burden. In
this respect too Hilary affords a noble pattern not only to the
Christian theologian but to the student of theology, however humble.

<span id="ii.ii-p8"></span>It has been an unfortunate necessity that use
has had to be made almost throughout of an untrustworthy text. The
critical edition which is being produced for the *Corpus
Scriptorum*<span id="page_VII">p. VII</span> <span
id="ii.ii-Page_VII"></span> *Eccelesiasticorum Latinorum* of the Vienna
Academy does not as yet extend beyond the Commentary on the Psalms (*S.
Hilarii Ep. Pictaviensis Tract. super Psalmos*, recens. A. Zingerle,
Vindobonae, <span class="c12"><span
id="ii.ii-p8.1"></span>mdcccxci</span>). This is the more to be
regretted as the <span class="c12"><span
id="ii.ii-p8.2"></span>mss.</span> of Hilary are rather exceptionally
early and good. Most of these were used in the Benedictine edition, but
not so systematically or thoroughly as a modern standard requires. It is
impossible to speak decidedly about the text of Hilary until the Vienna
edition is completed.

<span id="ii.ii-p9"></span>The treatise *De Synodis* was translated by
the Rev. L. Pullan, and has been in print for some time. The
Introduction and the translation of *De Trinitate* i.–vii. are the work
of Mr. Watson. Books viii. and xii. were undertaken Mr. E. N. Bennett,
Fellow of Hertford, and Books ix.–xi. by the Rev. S. C. Gayford, late
Scholar of Exeter. The specimens of the Commentary on the Psalms were
translated by the Rev. H. F. Stewart, Vice-Principal of the Theological
College, Salisbury, who has also made himself responsible for the double
Index.

<span id="ii.ii-p10"></span>A word of special thanks is due to the
printers, Messrs. Parker, who have carried out their part of the work
with conspicuous intelligence and with the most conscientious care.
