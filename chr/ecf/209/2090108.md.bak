<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*Concerning the
Passion of our Lord’s body, and the Impassibility of His divinity.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxvi-p2"></span>The Word of God then itself endured
all in the flesh, while His divine nature which alone was passionless
remained void of passion. For since the one Christ, Who is a compound of
divinity and humanity, and exists in divinity and humanity, truly
suffered, that part which is capable of passion suffered as it was
natural it should, but that part which was void of passion did not share
in the suffering. For the soul, indeed, since it is capable of passion
shares in the pain and suffering of a bodily cut, though it is not cut
itself but only the body: but the divine part which is void of passion
does not share in the suffering of the body.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxvi-p3"></span>Observe, further <span
id="fr_2231"></span>[2232](#fn_2231.md) , that we say that God suffered in
the flesh, but never that His divinity suffered in the flesh, or that
God suffered through the flesh. For if, when the sun is shining upon a
tree, the axe should cleave the tree, and, nevertheless, the sun remains
uncleft and void of passion, much more will the passionless divinity of
the Word, united in subsistence to the flesh, remain void of passion
when the body undergoes passion <span
id="fr_2232"></span>[2233](#fn_2232.md) . And should any one pour water
over flaming steel, it is that which naturally suffers by the water, I
mean, the fire, that is quenched, but the steel remains untouched (for
it is not the nature of steel to be destroyed by water): much more,
then, when the flesh suffered did His only passionless divinity escape
all passion although abiding inseparable from it. For one must not take
the examples too absolutely and strictly: indeed, in the examples, one
must consider both what is like and what is unlike, otherwise it would
not be an example. For, if they were like in all respects they would be
identities, and not examples, and all the more so in dealing with divine
matters. For one cannot find an example that is like in all respects
whether we are dealing with theology or the dispensation.
