<span id="iii.iv.iv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*Concerning the Cross
and here further concerning Faith.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xi-p2"></span>The word ‘*Cross*’ *is foolishness to
those that perish, but to us who are saved it is the power of
God*. <span id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342) For *he that is
spiritual judgeth all things, but the natural man receiveth not the
things of the Spirit.* <span id="fr_2343"></span>[2344](#fn_2343) For it
is foolishness to those who do not receive in faith and who do not
consider God’s goodness and omnipotence, but search out divine things
with human and natural reasonings. For all the things that are of God
are above nature and reason and conception. For should any one consider
how and for what purpose God brought all things out of nothing and into
being, and aim at arriving at that by natural reasonings, he fails to
comprehend it. For knowledge of this kind belongs to spirits and demons.
But if any one, under the guidance of faith, should consider the divine
goodness <span id="page_80b">p. 80b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xi-Page_80b"></span>and omnipotence and truth and wisdom
and justice, he will find all things smooth and even, and the way
straight. *But without faith it is impossible to be saved* <span
id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344) . For it is by faith that all
things, both human and spiritual, are sustained. For without faith
neither does the farmer <span id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345) cut
his furrow, nor does the merchant commit his life to the raging waves of
the sea on a small piece of wood, nor are marriages contracted nor any
other step in life taken. By faith we consider that all things were
brought out of nothing into being by God’s power. And we direct all
things, both divine and human, by faith. Further, faith is assent free
from all meddlesome inquisitiveness <span
id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xi-p8"></span>Every action, therefore, and
performance of miracles by Christ are most great and divine and
marvellous: but the most marvellous of all is His precious Cross. For no
other thing has subdued death, expiated the sin of the first
parent <span id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347) , despoiled Hades,
bestowed the resurrection, granted the power to us of contemning the
present and even death itself, prepared the return to our former
blessedness, opened the gates of Paradise <span
id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348) , given our nature a seat at the
right hand of God, and made us the children and heirs of God <span
id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349) , save the Cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ. For by the Cross <span id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350) all
things have been made right. *So many of us, the apostle says, as were
baptized into Christ, were baptized into His death* <span
id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351) , and *as many of you as have been
baptized into Christ, have put on Christ* <span
id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352) . Further *Christ is the power of
God and the wisdom of God* <span id="fr_2353"></span>[2354](#fn_2353) .
Lo! the death of Christ, that is, the Cross, clothed us with the
enhypostatic wisdom and power of God. And the power of God is the Word
of the Cross, either because God’s might, that is, the victory over
death, has been revealed to us by it, or because, just as the four
extremities of the Cross are held fast and bound together by the bolt in
the middle, so also by God’s power the height and the depth, the length
and the breadth, that is, every creature visible and invisible, is
maintained <span id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xi-p17"></span>This was given to us as a sign on our
forehead, just as the circumcision was given to Israel: for by it we
believers are separated and distinguished from unbelievers. This is the
shield and weapon against, and trophy over, the devil. *This is the seal
that the destroyer may not touch you* <span
id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355) , as saith the Scripture. This is
the resurrection of those lying in death, the support of the standing,
the staff of the weak, the rod of the flock, the safe conduct of the
earnest, the perfection of those that press forwards, the salvation of
soul and body, the aversion of all things evil, the patron of all things
good, the taking away of sin, the plant of resurrection, the tree of
eternal life.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xi-p19"></span>So, then, this same truly precious
and august tree <span id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356) , on which
Christ hath offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sakes, is to be
worshipped as sanctified by contact with His holy body and blood;
likewise the nails, the spear, the clothes, His sacred tabernacles which
are the manger, the cave, Golgotha, which bringeth salvation <span
id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357) , the tomb which giveth life, Sion,
the chief stronghold of the churches and the like, are to be worshipped.
In the words of David, the father of God <span
id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358) , *We shall go into His
tabernacles, we shall worship at the place where His feet stood* <span
id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359) . And that it is the Cross that is
meant is made clear by what follows, *Arise, O Lord, into Thy
Rest* <span id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360) . For the resurrection
comes after the Cross. For if of those things which we love, house and
couch and garment, are to be longed after, how much the rather should we
long after that which belonged to God, our Saviour <span
id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361) , by means of which we are in truth
saved.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xi-p26"></span>Moreover we worship even the image of
the precious and life-giving Cross, although made of another tree, not
honouring the tree (God forbid) but the image as a symbol of Christ. For
He said to His disciples, admonishing them, *Then shall appear the sign
of the Son of Man in Heaven* <span id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362)
, meaning the Cross. And so also the angel of the resurrection said to
the woman, *Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified* <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363) . And the Apostle said, *We preach
Christ crucified* <span id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364) . For there
are many Christs and many Jesuses, but one crucified. He does not say
speared but crucified. It behoves us, then, to worship the sign of
Christ <span id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365) . For wherever the
sign may be, there also will He be. But it does not behove us to worship
the material of which the image of the Cross is composed, even though it
be gold or precious stones, after it is destroyed, if that should
happen. Everything, therefore, that is dedicated to God we worship,
conferring the adoration on Him.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xi-p31"></span>The tree of life which was planted by
God in Paradise pre-figured this precious Cross. <span id="page_81b">p.
81b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iv.xi-Page_81b"></span>For since death was
by a tree, it was fitting that life and resurrection should be bestowed
by a tree <span id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366) . Jacob, when He
worshipped the top of Joseph’s staff, was the first to image the Cross,
and when he blessed his sons with crossed hands <span
id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367) he made most clearly the sign of
the cross. Likewise <span id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368) also did
Moses’ rod, when it smote the sea in the figure of the cross and saved
Israel, while it overwhelmed Pharaoh in the depths; likewise also the
hands stretched out crosswise and routing Amalek; and the bitter water
made sweet by a tree, and the rock rent and pouring forth streams of
water <span id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369) , and the rod that
meant for Aaron the dignity of the high priesthood <span
id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370) : and the serpent lifted in triumph
on a tree as though it were dead <span
id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371) , the tree bringing salvation to
those who in faith saw their enemy dead, just as Christ was nailed to
the tree in the flesh of sin which yet knew no sin <span
id="fr_2372"></span>[2373](#fn_2372) . The mighty Moses cried <span
id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373) , *You will see your life hanging
on the tree before your eyes*, and Isaiah likewise, *I have spread out
my hands all the day unto a faithless and rebellious people* <span
id="fr_2374"></span>[2375](#fn_2374) . But may we who worship this <span
id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375) obtain a part in Christ the
crucified. Amen.
