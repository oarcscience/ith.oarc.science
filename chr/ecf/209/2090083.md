<span id="iii.iv.iii.i-p1"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.i-p1.1"></span>Book III.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iii.i-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*Concerning the Divine
Œconomy and God’s care over us, and concerning our salvation.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.i-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.i-p3.1"></span>Man</span>, then, was thus snared by the
assault of the arch-fiend, and broke his Creator’s command, and was
stripped of grace and put off his confidence with God, and covered
himself with the asperities of a toilsome life (for this is the meaning
of the fig-leaves <span id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923) .md); and was
clothed about with death, that is, mortality and the grossness of flesh
(for this is what the garment of skins signifies); and was banished from
Paradise by God’s just judgment, and condemned to death, and made
subject to corruption. Yet, notwithstanding all this, in His pity, God,
Who gave him his being, and Who in His graciousness bestowed on him a
life of happiness, did not disregard man <span
id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924.md) . But He first trained him in many
ways and called him back, by groans and trembling, by the deluge of
water, and the utter destruction of almost the whole race <span
id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925.md) , by confusion and diversity of
tongues <span id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926.md) , by the rule <span
id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927.md) of angels <span
id="fr_1928"></span>[1929](#fn_1928.md) , by the burning of cities <span
id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929.md) , by figurative manifestations of
God, by wars and victories and defeats, by signs and wonders, by
manifold faculties, by the law and the prophets: for by all these means
God earnestly strove to emancipate man from the wide-spread and
enslaving bonds of sin, which had made life such a mass of iniquity, and
to effect man’s return to a life of happiness. For it was sin that
brought death like a wild and savage beast into the world <span
id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930.md) to the ruin of the human life. But
it behoved the Redeemer to be without sin, and not made liable through
sin to death, and further, that His nature should be strengthened and
renewed, and trained by labour and taught the way of virtue which leads
away from corruption to the life eternal and, in the end, is revealed
the mighty ocean of love to man that is about Him <span
id="fr_1931"></span>[1932](#fn_1931.md) . For the very Creator and Lord
Himself undertakes a struggle <span id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932.md)
in behalf of the work of His own hands, and learns by toil to become
Master. And since the enemy snares man by the hope of Godhead, he
himself is snared in turn by the screen of flesh, and so are shown at
once the goodness and wisdom, the justice and might of God. God’s
goodness is revealed in that He did not disregard <span
id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933.md) the frailty of His own handiwork,
but was moved with compassion for him in his fall, and stretched forth
His hand to him: and His justice in that when man was overcome He did
not make another victorious over the tyrant, nor did He snatch man by
might from death, but in His goodness and justice He made him, who had
become through his sins the slave of death, himself once more conqueror
and rescued like by like, most difficult though it seemed: and His
wisdom is seen in His devising the most fitting solution of the
difficulty <span id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934.md) . For by the good
pleasure of our God and Father, the Only-begotten Son and Word of God
and God, Who is in the bosom of the God and Father <span
id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935.md) , of like essence with the Father
and the Holy Spirit, Who was before the ages, Who is without beginning
and was in the beginning, Who is in the presence of the God and Father,
and is God and made in the form of God <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936.md) , bent the heavens and descended to
earth: that is to say, He humbled without humiliation His lofty station
which yet could not be humbled, and condescends to His servants <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937.md) , with a condescension ineffable
and incomprehensible: (for that is what the descent signifies). And God
being perfect becomes perfect man, and brings to perfection the newest
of all new things <span id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938.md) , the only
new thing under the Sun, through which the boundless might of God is
manifested. For what greater thing is there, than that God should become
Man? And the Word became flesh without being changed, of the Holy
Spirit, and Mary the holy and ever-virgin one, the mother of God. And He
acts as mediator between God and man, He the only lover of man conceived
in the Virgin’s chaste womb without will <span
id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939.md) or desire, or any connection with
man or pleasurable generation, but through the <span id="page_46b">p.
46b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iii.i-Page_46b"></span>Holy Spirit and the
first offspring of Adam. And He becomes obedient to the Father Who is
like unto us, and finds a remedy for our disobedience in what He had
assumed from us, and became a pattern of obedience to us without which
it is not possible to obtain salvation <span
id="fr_1940"></span>[1941](#fn_1940.md) .
