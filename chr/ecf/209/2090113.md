<span id="iii.iv.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*Concerning what followed
the Resurrection.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.i-p3"></span>After Christ was risen from the dead He
laid aside all His passions, I mean His corruption or hunger or thirst
or sleep or weariness or such like. For, although He did taste food
after the resurrection <span id="fr_2251"></span>[2252](#fn_2251) , yet
He did not do so because it was a law of His nature (for He felt no
hunger), but in the way of economy, in order that He might convince us
of the reality of the resurrection, and that it was one and the same
flesh which suffered and rose again <span
id="fr_2252"></span>[2253](#fn_2252) . But He laid aside none of the
divisions of His nature, neither body nor spirit, but possesses both the
body and the soul intelligent and reasonable, volitional and energetic,
and in this wise He sits at the right hand of the Father, using His will
both as God and as man in behalf of our salvation, energising in His
divine capacity to provide for and maintain and govern all things, and
remembering in His human capacity the time He spent on earth, while all
the time He both sees and knows that He is adored by all rational
creation. For His Holy Spirit knows that He is one in substance with God
the Word, and shares as Spirit of God and not simply as Spirit the
worship accorded to Him. Moreover, His ascent from earth to heaven, and
again, His descent from heaven to earth, are manifestations of the
energies of His circumscribed body. *For He shall so come again to you,
saith he, in like manner as ye have seen Him go into Heaven* <span
