<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*Concerning His
Fear.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxiii-p2"></span>The word fear has a double
meaning. For fear is natural when the soul is unwilling to be separated
from the body, on account of the natural sympathy and close relationship
planted in it in the beginning by the Creator, which makes it fear and
struggle against death and pray for an escape from it. It may be defined
thus: natural fear is the force whereby we cling to being with
shrinking <span id="fr_2215"></span>[2216](#fn_2215.md) . For if all things
were brought by the Creator out of nothing into being, they all have by
nature a longing after being and not after non-being. Moreover the
inclination towards those things that support existence is a natural
property of them. Hence God the Word when He became man had this
longing, manifesting, on the one hand, in those things that support
existence, the inclination of His nature in desiring food and drink and
sleep, and having in a natural manner made proof of these things, while
on the other hand displaying in those things that bring corruption His
natural disinclination in voluntarily shrinking in the hour of His
passion before the face of death. For although what happened did so
according to the laws of nature, yet it was not, as in our case, a
matter of necessity. For He willingly and spontaneously accepted that
which was natural. So that fear itself and terror and agony belong to
the natural and innocent passions and are not under the dominion of sin.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxiii-p4"></span>Again, there is a fear which
arises from treachery of reasoning and want of faith, and ignorance of
the hour of death, as when we are at night affected by fear at some
chance noise. This is unnatural fear, and may be thus defined: unnatural
fear is an unexpected shrinking. This our Lord did not assume. Hence He
never felt fear except in the hour of His passion, although He often
experienced a feeling of shrinking in accordance with the dispensation.
For He was not ignorant of the appointed time.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxiii-p5"></span>But the holy Athanasius in his
discourse against Apollinarius says that He did actually feel fear.
“Wherefore the Lord said: *Now is My soul troubled* <span
id="fr_2216"></span>[2217](#fn_2216.md) . The ‘now’ indeed means just ‘when
He willed,’ but yet points to what actually was. For He did not speak of
what was not, as though it were present, as if the things that were said
only apparently happened. For all things happened naturally and
actually.” And again, after some other matters, he says, “In nowise does
His divinity admit passion apart from a suffering body, nor yet does it
manifest trouble and pain apart from a pained and troubled soul, nor
does it suffer anguish and offer up prayer apart from a mind that
suffered anguish and offered up prayer. For, although these occurrences
were not due to any overthrow of nature, yet they took place to shew
forth His real being <span id="fr_2217"></span>[2218](#fn_2217.md) .” The
words “these occurrences were not due to any overthrow of His nature,”
prove that it was not involuntarily that He endured these things.
