<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII</span>.—*Concerning the
reason of our endowment with Free-will.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxvii-p2"></span>We hold, therefore, that
free-will <span id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881.md) comes on the scene
at the same moment as reason, and that change and alteration are
congenital to all that is produced. For all that is produced is also
subject to change <span id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882.md) . For those
things must be subject to change whose production has its origin in
change. And change consists in being brought into being out of nothing,
and in transforming a substratum of matter into something different.
Inanimate things, then, and things without reason undergo the
aforementioned bodily changes, while the changes of things endowed with
reason depend on choice. For reason consists of a speculative and a
practical part. The speculative part is the contemplation of the nature
of things, and the practical consists in deliberation and defines the
true reason for what is to be done. The speculative side is called mind
or wisdom, and the practical side is called reason or prudence. Every
one, then, who deliberates does so in the belief that the choice of what
is to be done lies in his hands, that he may choose what seems best as
the result of his deliberation, and having chosen may act upon it. And
if this is so, free-will must necessarily be very closely related to
reason. For either man is an irrational being, or, if he is rational, he
is master of his acts and endowed with free-will. Hence also creatures
without reason do not enjoy free-will: for nature leads them rather than
they nature, and so they do not oppose the natural appetite, but as soon
as their appetite longs after anything they rush headlong after it. But
man, being rational, leads nature rather than nature him, and so when he
desires aught he has the power to curb his appetite or to indulge it as
he pleases. Hence also creatures devoid of reason are the subjects
neither of praise nor blame, while man is the subject of both praise and
blame <span id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxvii-p6"></span>Note also that the angels, being
rational, are endowed with free-will, and, inasmuch as they are created,
are liable to change. This <span id="page_41b">p. 41b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.xxvii-Page_41b"></span>in fact is made plain by the devil
who, although made good by the Creator, became of his own free-will the
inventor of evil, and by the powers who revolted with him <span
id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884.md) , that is the demons, and by the
other troops of angels who abode in goodness.
