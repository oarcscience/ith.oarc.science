<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*Concerning what is
in our own power, that is, concerning Free-will* <span
id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxv-p3"></span>The first enquiry involved in the
consideration of free-will, that is, of what is in our own power, is
whether anything is in our power <span
id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874) : for there are many who deny this.
The second is, what are the things that are in our power, and over what
things do we have authority? The third is, what is the reason for which
God Who created us endued us with free-will? So then we shall take up
the first question, and firstly we shall prove that of those things
which even our opponents grant, some are within our power. And let us
proceed thus.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxv-p5"></span>Of all the things that happen, the
cause is said to be either God, or necessity, or fate, or nature, or
chance, or accident. But God’s function has to do with essence and
providence: necessity deals with the movement of things that ever keep
to the same course: fate with the necessary accomplishment of the things
it brings to pass (for fate itself implies necessity): nature with
birth, growth, destruction, plants and animals; chance with what is rare
and unexpected. For chance is defined as the meeting and concurrence of
two causes, originating in choice but bringing to pass something other
than what is natural: for example, if a man finds a treasure while
digging a ditch <span id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875) : for the man
who hid the treasure did not do so that the other might find it, nor did
the finder dig with the purpose of finding the treasure: but the former
hid it that he might take it away when he wished, and the other’s aim
was to dig the ditch: whereas something happened quite different from
what both had in view. Accident again deals with casual occurrences that
take place among lifeless or irrational things, apart from nature and
art. This then is their doctrine. Under which, then, of these categories
are we to bring what happens through the agency of <span
id="page_40b">p. 40b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.xxv-Page_40b"></span>man, if indeed man is not the cause
and beginning of action <span id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876) ? for
it would not be right to ascribe to God actions that are sometimes base
and unjust: nor may we ascribe these to necessity, for they are not such
as ever continue the same: nor to fate, for fate implies not possibility
only but necessity: nor to nature, for nature’s province is animals and
plants: nor to chance, for the actions of men are not rare and
unexpected: nor to accident, for that is used in reference to the casual
occurrences that take place in the world of lifeless and irrational
things. We are left then with this fact, that the man who acts and makes
is himself the author of his own works, and is a creature endowed with
free-will.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxv-p8"></span>Further, if man is the author of no
action, the faculty of deliberation is quite superfluous: for to what
purpose could deliberation be put if man is the master of none of his
actions? for all deliberation is for the sake of action. But to prove
that the fairest and most precious of man’s endowments is quite
superfluous would be the height of absurdity. If then man deliberates,
he deliberates with a view to action. For all deliberation is with a
view to and on account of action.
