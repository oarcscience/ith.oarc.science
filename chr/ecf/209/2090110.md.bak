<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII</span>.—*Concerning
Corruption and Destruction.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxviii-p2"></span>The word corruption <span
id="fr_2238"></span>[2239](#fn_2238.md) has two meanings <span
id="fr_2239"></span>[2240](#fn_2239.md) . For it signifies all the human
sufferings, such as hunger, thirst, weariness, the piercing with nails,
death, that is, the separation of soul and body, and so forth. In this
sense we say that our Lord’s body was subject to corruption. For He
voluntarily accepted all these things. But corruption means also the
complete resolution of the body into its constituent elements, and its
utter disappearance, which is spoken of by many preferably as
destruction. The body of our Lord did not experience this form of
corruption, as the prophet David says, *For Thou wilt not leave my soul
in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine holy one to see
corruption* <span id="fr_2240"></span>[2241](#fn_2240.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxviii-p6"></span>Wherefore to say, with that
foolish Julianus and Gaïanus, that our Lord’s body was incorruptible, in
the first sense of the word, before His resurrection is impious. For if
it were incorruptible it was not really, but only apparently, of the
same essence as ours, and what the Gospel tells us happened, viz. the
hunger, the thirst, the nails, the wound in His side, the death, did not
actually occur. But if they only apparently happened, then the mystery
of the dispensation is an imposture and a sham, and He became man only
in appearance, and not in actual fact, and we are saved only in
appearance, and not in actual fact. But God forbid, and may those who so
say have no part in the salvation <span
id="fr_2241"></span>[2242](#fn_2241.md) . But we have obtained and shall
obtain the true salvation. But in the second meaning of the word
“corruption,” we confess that our Lord’s body is incorruptible, that is,
indestructible, for such is the tradition of the inspired Fathers.
Indeed, after the resurrection of our Saviour from the dead, we say that
our Lord’s body is incorruptible even in the first sense of the word.
For our Lord by His own body bestowed the gifts both of resurrection and
of subsequent incorruption even on our own body, He Himself having
become to us the firstfruits both of resurrection and incorruption, and
of passionlessness <span id="fr_2242"></span>[2243](#fn_2242.md) . For as
the divine Apostle says, *This corruptible must put on
incorruption* <span id="fr_2243"></span>[2244](#fn_2243.md) .
