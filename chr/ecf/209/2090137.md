<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*Concerning the
Circumcision.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxv-p2"></span>The Circumcision <span
id="fr_2693"></span>[2694](#fn_2693) was given to Abraham before the
law, after the blessings, after the promise, as a sign separating him
and his offspring and his household from the Gentiles with whom he
lived <span id="fr_2694"></span>[2695](#fn_2694) . And this is
evident <span id="fr_2695"></span>[2696](#fn_2695) , <span
id="page_98b">p. 98b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iv.xxv-Page_98b"></span>for
when the Israelites passed forty years alone by themselves in the
desert, having no intercourse with any other race, all that were born in
the desert were uncircumcised: but when Joshua <span
id="fr_2696"></span>[2697](#fn_2696) led them across Jordan, they were
circumcised, and a second law of circumcision was instituted. For in
Abraham’s time the law of circumcision was given, and for the forty
years in the desert it fell into abeyance. And again for the second time
God gave the law of Circumcision to Joshua, after the crossing of
Jordan, according as it is written in the book of Joshua, the son of
Nun: *At that time the Lord said unto Joshua, Make thee knives of stone
from the sharp rock, and assemble and circumcise the sons of Israel a
second time* <span id="fr_2697"></span>[2698](#fn_2697) ; and a little
later: *For the children of Israel walked forty and two* <span
id="fr_2698"></span>[2699](#fn_2698) *years in the wilderness of
Battaris* <span id="fr_2699"></span>[2700](#fn_2699) *, till all the
people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were
uncircumcised, because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord: unto whom
the Lord sware that He would not shew them the good land, which the Lord
swore unto their fathers that He would give them, a land that floweth
with milk and honey. And their children, whom He raised up in their
stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because
they had not circumcised them by the way* <span
id="fr_2700"></span>[2701](#fn_2700) . So that the circumcision was a
sign, dividing Israel from the Gentiles with whom they dwelt.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxv-p11"></span>It was, moreover, a figure of
baptism <span id="fr_2701"></span>[2702](#fn_2701) . For just as the
circumcision does not cut off a useful member of the body but only a
useless superfluity, so by the holy baptism we are circumcised from sin,
and sin clearly is, so to speak, the superfluous part of desire and not
useful desire. For it is quite impossible that any one should have no
desire at all nor ever experience the taste of pleasure. But the useless
part of pleasure, that is to say, useless desire and pleasure, it is
this that is sin from which holy baptism circumcises us, giving us as a
token the precious cross on the brow, not to divide us from the Gentiles
(for all the nations received baptism and were sealed with the sign of
the Cross), but to distinguish in each nation the faithful from the
faithless. Wherefore, when the truth is revealed, circumcision is a
senseless figure and shade. So circumcision is now superfluous and
contrary to holy baptism. *For he who is circumcised is a debtor to do
the whole law* <span id="fr_2702"></span>[2703](#fn_2702) . Further, the
Lord was circumcised that He might fulfil the law: and He fulfilled the
whole law and observed the Sabbath that He might fulfil and establish
the law <span id="fr_2703"></span>[2704](#fn_2703) . Moreover after He
was baptized and the Holy Spirit had appeared to men, descending on Him
in the form of a dove, from that time the spiritual service and conduct
of life and the Kingdom of Heaven was preached.
