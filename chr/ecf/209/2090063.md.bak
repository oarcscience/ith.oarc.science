<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*Concerning Man.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p2.1"></span>In</span> this way, then, God brought
into existence mental essence <span id="fr_1793"></span>[1794](#fn_1793.md)
, by which I mean, angels and all the heavenly orders. For these clearly
have a mental and incorporeal nature: “incorporeal” I mean in comparison
with the denseness of matter. For the Deity alone in reality is
immaterial and incorporeal. But further He created in the same way
sensible essence <span id="fr_1794"></span>[1795](#fn_1794.md) , that is
heaven and earth and the intermediate region; and so He created both the
kind of being that is of His own nature (for the nature that has to do
with reason is related to God, and apprehensible by mind alone), and the
kind which, inasmuch as it clearly falls under the province of the
senses, is separated from Him by the greatest interval. And it was also
fit that there should be a mixture of both kinds of being, as a token of
still greater wisdom and of the opulence of the Divine expenditure as
regards natures, as Gregorius, the expounder of God’s being and ways,
puts it, and to be a sort of connecting link between the visible and
invisible natures <span id="fr_1795"></span>[1796](#fn_1795.md) . And by
the word “fit” I mean, simply that it was an evidence of the Creator’s
will, for that will is the law and ordinance most meet, and no one will
say to his Maker, “Why hast Thou so fashioned me?” For the potter is
able at his will to make vessels of various patterns out of his
clay <span id="fr_1796"></span>[1797](#fn_1796.md) , as a proof of his own
wisdom.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p7"></span>Now this being the case, He creates
with His own hands man of a visible nature and an invisible, after His
own image and likeness: on the one hand man’s body He formed of earth,
and on the other his reasoning and <span id="page_31b">p. 31b</span>
<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-Page_31b"></span>thinking soul <span
id="fr_1797"></span>[1798](#fn_1797.md) He bestowed upon him by His own
inbreathing, and this is what we mean by “after His image.” For the
phrase “after His image” clearly refers <span
id="fr_1798"></span>[1799](#fn_1798.md) to the side of his nature which
consists of mind and free will, whereas “after His likeness” means
likeness in virtue so far as that is possible.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p10"></span>Further, body and soul were formed
at one and the same time <span id="fr_1799"></span>[1800](#fn_1799.md) ,
not first the one and then the other, as Origen so senselessly supposes.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p12"></span>God then made man without evil,
upright, virtuous, free from pain and care, glorified with every virtue,
adorned with all that is good, like a sort of second microcosm within
the great world <span id="fr_1800"></span>[1801](#fn_1800.md) , another
angel capable of worship, compound, surveying the visible creation and
initiated into the mysteries of the realm of thought, king over the
things of earth, but subject to a higher king, of the earth and of the
heaven, temporal and eternal, belonging to the realm of sight and to the
realm of thought, midway between greatness and lowliness, spirit and
flesh: for he is spirit by grace, but flesh by overweening pride: spirit
that he may abide and glorify his Benefactor, and flesh that he may
suffer, and suffering may be admonished and disciplined when he prides
himself in his greatness <span id="fr_1801"></span>[1802](#fn_1801.md) :
here, that is, in the present life, his life is ordered as an animal’s,
but elsewhere, that is, in the age to come, he is changed and—to
complete the mystery—becomes deified by merely inclining himself towards
God; becoming deified, in the way of participating in the divine glory
and not in that of a change into the divine being <span
id="fr_1802"></span>[1803](#fn_1802.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p16"></span>But God made him by nature sinless,
and endowed him with free will. By sinless, I mean not that sin could
find no place in him (for that is the case with Deity alone), but that
sin is the result of the free volition he enjoys rather than an integral
part of his nature <span id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803.md) ; that is
to say, he has the power to continue and go forward in the path of
goodness, by co-operating with the divine grace, and likewise to turn
from good and take to wickedness, for God has conceded this by
conferring freedom of will upon him. For there is no virtue in what is
the result of mere force <span id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p19"></span>The soul, accordingly <span
id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805.md) , is a living essence, simple,
incorporeal, invisible in its proper nature to bodily eyes, immortal,
reasoning and intelligent, formless, making use of an organised body,
and being the source of its powers of life, and growth, and sensation,
and generation <span id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806.md) , mind being
but its purest part and not in any wise alien to it; (for as the eye to
the body, so is the mind to the soul); further it enjoys freedom and
volition and energy, and is mutable, that is, it is given to change,
because it is created. All these qualities according to nature it has
received of the grace of the Creator, of which grace it has received
both its being and this particular kind of nature.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p22"></span>*Marg. The different applications of
“incorporeal.”* We understand two kinds of what is incorporeal and
invisible and formless: the one is such in essence, the other by free
gift: and likewise the one is such in nature, and the other only in
comparison with the denseness of matter. God then is incorporeal by
nature, but the angels and demons and souls are said to be so by free
gift, and in comparison with the denseness of matter.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p23"></span>Further, body is that which has
three dimensions, that is to say, it has length and breadth and depth,
or thickness. And every body is composed of the four elements; the
bodies of living creatures, moreover, are composed of the four humours.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p24"></span>Now there are, it should be known,
four elements: earth which is dry and cold: water which is cold and wet:
air which is wet and warm: fire which is warm and dry. In like manner
there are also four humours, analogous to the four elements: black bile,
which bears an analogy to earth, for it is dry and cold: phlegm,
analogous to water, for it is cold and wet: blood, analogous to
air <span id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807.md) , for it is wet and warm:
yellow bile, the analogue to fire, for it is warm and dry. Now, fruits
are composed of the elements, and the humours are composed of the
fruits, and the bodies of living creatures consist of the humours and
dissolve back into them. For every thing that is compound dissolves back
into its elements.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p26"></span>*Marg. That man has community alike
with inanimate things and animate creatures, whe*<span id="page_32b">p.
32b</span> <span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-Page_32b"></span>*ther they are
devoid of or possess the faculty of reason.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p27"></span>Man, it is to be noted, has
community with things inanimate, and participates in the life of
unreasoning creatures, and shares in the mental processes of those
endowed with reason. For the bond of union between man and inanimate
things is the body and its composition out of the four elements: and the
bond between man and plants consists, in addition to these things, of
their powers of nourishment and growth and seeding, that is, generation:
and finally, over and above these links man is connected with
unreasoning animals by appetite, that is anger and desire, and sense and
impulsive movement.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p28"></span>There are then five senses, sight,
hearing, smell, taste, touch. Further, impulsive movement consists in
change from place to place, and in the movements of the body as a whole
and in the emission of voice and the drawing of breath. For we have it
in our power to perform or refrain from performing these actions.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p29"></span>Lastly, man’s reason unites him to
incorporeal and intelligent natures, for he applies his reason and mind
and judgment to everything, and pursues after virtues, and eagerly
follows after piety, which is the crown of the virtues. And so man is a
microcosm.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p30"></span>Moreover, it should be known that
division and flux and change <span id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808.md)
are peculiar to the body alone. By change, I mean change in quality,
that is in heat and cold and so forth: by flux, I mean change in the way
of depletion <span id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809.md) , for dry things
and wet things and spirit <span id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810.md)
suffer depletion, and require repletion: so that hunger and thirst are
natural affections. Again, division is the separation of the humours,
one from another, and the partition into form and matter <span
id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p35"></span>But piety and thought are the
peculiar properties of the soul. And the virtues are common to soul and
body, although they are referred to the soul as if the soul were making
use of the body.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p36"></span>The reasoning part, it should be
understood, naturally bears rule over that which is void of reason. For
the faculties of the soul are divided into that which has reason, and
that which is without reason. Again, of that which is without reason
there are two divisions: that which does not listen to reason, that is
to say, is disobedient to reason, and that which listens and obeys
reason. That which does not listen or obey reason is the vital or
pulsating faculty, and the spermatic or generative faculty, and the
vegetative or nutritive faculty: to this belong also the faculties of
growth and bodily formation. For these are not under the dominion of
reason but under that of nature. That which listens to and obeys reason,
on the other hand is divided into anger and desire. And the unreasoning
part of the soul is called in common the pathetic and the
appetitive <span id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812.md) . Further, it is
to be understood, that impulsive movement <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813.md) likewise belongs to the part that
is obedient to reason.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p39"></span>The part <span
id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814.md) which does not pay heed to reason
includes the nutritive and generative and pulsating faculties: and the
name “vegetative <span id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815.md) ” is applied
to the faculties of increase and nutriment and generation, and the name
“vital” to the faculty of pulsation.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p42"></span>Of the faculty of nutrition, then,
there are four forces: an attractive force which attracts nourishment: a
retentive force by which nourishment is retained and not suffered to be
immediately excreted: an alternative force by which the food is resolved
into the humours: and an excretive force, by which the excess of food is
excreted into the draught and cast forth.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p43"></span>The forces again <span
id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816.md) , inherent in a living creature
are, it should be noted, partly psychical, partly vegetative, partly
vital. The psychical forces are concerned with free volition, that is to
say, impulsive movement and sensation. Impulsive movement includes
change of place and movement of the body as a whole, and phonation and
respiration. For it is in our power to perform or refrain from
performing these acts. The vegetative and vital forces, however, are
quite outside the province of will. The vegetative, moreover, include
the faculties of nourishment and growth, and generation, and the vital
power is the faculty of pulsation. For these go on energising whether we
will it or not.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xii-p45"></span>Lastly, we must observe that of
actual things, some are good, and some are bad. A good thing in
anticipation constitutes desire: while a good thing in realisation
constitutes pleasure. Similarly an evil thing in anticipation begets
fear, and in realisation it begets pain. And when we speak of good in
this connection we are to be understood to mean both real and apparent
good: and, similarly, we mean real and apparent evil.
