<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII</span>.—*Concerning the
fact that the divinity of the Word remained inseparable from the soul*
<span id="page_72b">p. 72b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii.xxvii-Page_72b"></span>*and the body, even at our Lord’s
death, and that His subsistence continued one.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxvii-p2"></span>Since our Lord Jesus Christ was
without sin (*for He committed no sin, He Who took away the sin of the
world, nor was there any deceit found in His mouth* <span
id="fr_2233"></span>[2234](#fn_2233) ) He was not subject to death,
since death came into the world through sin <span
id="fr_2234"></span>[2235](#fn_2234) . He dies, therefore, because He
took on Himself death on our behalf, and He makes Himself an offering to
the Father for our sakes. For we had sinned against Him, and it was meet
that He should receive the ransom for us, and that we should thus be
delivered from the condemnation. God forbid that the blood of the Lord
should have been offered to the tyrant <span
id="fr_2235"></span>[2236](#fn_2235) . Wherefore death approaches, and
swallowing up the body as a bait is transfixed on the hook of divinity,
and after tasting of a sinless and life-giving body, perishes, and
brings up again all whom of old he swallowed up. For just as darkness
disappears on the introduction of light, so is death repulsed before the
assault of life, and brings life to all, but death to the destroyer.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxvii-p6"></span>Wherefore, although <span
id="fr_2236"></span>[2237](#fn_2236) He died as man and His Holy Spirit
was severed from His immaculate body, yet His divinity remained
inseparable from both, I mean, from His soul and His body, and so even
thus His one hypostasis was not divided into two hypostases. For body
and soul received simultaneously in the beginning their being in the
subsistence <span id="fr_2237"></span>[2238](#fn_2237) of the Word, and
although they were severed from one another by death, yet they
continued, each of them, having the one subsistence of the Word. So that
the one subsistence of the Word is alike the subsistence of the Word,
and of soul and body. For at no time had either soul or body a separate
subsistence of their own, different from that of the Word, and the
subsistence of the Word is for ever one, and at no time two. So that the
subsistence of Christ is always one. For, although the soul was
separated from the body topically, yet hypostatically they were united
through the Word.
