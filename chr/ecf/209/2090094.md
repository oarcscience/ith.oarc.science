<span id="iii.iv.iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*That the holy
Virgin is the Mother of God: an argument directed against the
Nestorians.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xii-p2"></span>Moreover we proclaim the holy Virgin
to be <span id="page_56b">p. 56b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii.xii-Page_56b"></span>in strict truth <span
id="fr_2064"></span>[2065](#fn_2064.md) the Mother of God <span
id="fr_2065"></span>[2066](#fn_2065.md) . For inasmuch as He who was born
of her was true God, she who bare the true God incarnate is the true
mother of God. For we hold that God was born of her, not implying that
the divinity of the Word received from her the beginning of its being,
but meaning that God the Word Himself, Who was begotten of the Father
timelessly before the ages, and was with the Father and the Spirit
without beginning and through eternity, took up His abode in these last
days for the sake of our salvation in the Virgin’s womb, and was without
change made flesh and born of her. For the holy Virgin did not bare mere
man but true God: and not mere God but God incarnate, Who did not bring
down His body from Heaven, nor simply passed through the Virgin as
channel, but received from her flesh of like essence to our own and
subsisting in Himself <span id="fr_2066"></span>[2067](#fn_2066.md) . For
if the body had come down from heaven and had not partaken of our
nature, what would have been the use of His becoming man? For the
purpose of God the Word becoming man <span
id="fr_2067"></span>[2068](#fn_2067.md) was that the very same nature,
which had sinned and fallen and become corrupted, should triumph over
the deceiving tyrant and so be freed from corruption, just as the divine
apostle puts it, *For since by man came death, by man came also the
resurrection of the dead* <span id="fr_2068"></span>[2069](#fn_2068.md) .
If the first is true the second must also be true.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xii-p8"></span>Although <span
id="fr_2069"></span>[2070](#fn_2069.md) , however, he says, *The first Adam
is of the earth earthy; the second Adam is Lord from Heaven* <span
id="fr_2070"></span>[2071](#fn_2070.md) , he does not say that His body is
from heaven, but emphasises the fact that He is not mere man. For, mark,
he called Him both Adam and Lord, thus indicating His double nature. For
Adam is, being interpreted, earth-born: and it is clear that man’s
nature is earth-born since he is formed from earth, but the title Lord
signifies His divine essence.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xii-p11"></span>And again the Apostle says: *God
sent forth His only-begotten Son, made of a woman* <span
id="fr_2071"></span>[2072](#fn_2071.md) . He did not say “made by a woman.”
Wherefore the divine apostle meant that the only-begotten Son of God and
God is the same as He who was made man of the Virgin, and that He who
was born of the Virgin is the same as the Son of God and God.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xii-p13"></span>But He was born after the bodily
fashion inasmuch as He became man, and did not take up His abode in a
man formed beforehand, as in a prophet, but became Himself in essence
and truth man, that is He caused flesh animated with the intelligent and
reasonable to subsist in His own subsistence, and Himself became
subsistence for it. For this is the meaning of “made of a woman.” For
how could the very Word of God itself have been made under the law, if
He did not become man of like essence with ourselves?

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xii-p14"></span>Hence it is with justice and truth
that we call the holy Mary the Mother of God. For this name embraces the
whole mystery of the dispensation. For if she who bore Him is the Mother
of God, assuredly He Who was born of her is God and likewise also man.
For how could God, Who was before the ages, have been born of a woman
unless He had become man? For the son of man must clearly be man
himself. But if He Who was born of a woman is Himself God, manifestly He
Who was born of God the Father in accordance with the laws of an essence
that is divine and knows no beginning, and He Who was in the last days
born of the Virgin in accordance with the laws of an essence that has
beginning and is subject to time, that is, an essence which is human,
must be one and the same. The name in truth signifies the one
subsistence and the two natures and the two generations of our Lord
Jesus Christ.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xii-p15"></span>But we never say that the holy
Virgin is the Mother of Christ <span
id="fr_2072"></span>[2073](#fn_2072.md) because it was in order to do away
with the title Mother of God, and to bring dishonour on the Mother of
God, who alone is in truth worthy of honour above all creation, that the
impure and abominable Judaizing Nestorius <span
id="fr_2073"></span>[2074](#fn_2073.md) , that vessel of dishonour,
invented this name for an insult <span
id="fr_2074"></span>[2075](#fn_2074.md) . For David the king, and Aaron,
the high priest, are also called *Christ* <span
id="fr_2075"></span>[2076](#fn_2075.md) , for it is customary to make kings
and priests by anointing: and besides every God-inspired man may be
called *Christ,* but yet he is not by nature God: yea, the accursed
Nestorius insulted Him Who was born of the Virgin by calling Him
God-bearer <span id="fr_2076"></span>[2077](#fn_2076.md) . May it be far
from us to speak of or think of Him as God-bearer only <span
id="fr_2077"></span>[2078](#fn_2077.md) , Who is in truth God incarnate.
For the Word Himself became flesh, having been in truth conceived of the
Virgin, but coming forth as God with the assumed nature which, as soon
as He was brought forth into being, was deified by Him, so that these
three things took place simultaneously, the assumption of our nature,
the coming into being, and the <span id="page_57b">p. 57b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii.xii-Page_57b"></span>deification of the assumed nature by
the Word. And thus it is that the holy Virgin is thought of and spoken
of as the Mother of God, not only because of the nature of the Word, but
also because of the deification of man’s nature, the miracles of
conception and of existence being wrought together, to wit, the
conception the Word, and the existence of the flesh in the Word Himself.
For the very Mother of God in some marvellous manner was the means of
fashioning the Framer of all things and of bestowing manhood on the God
and Creator of all, Who deified the nature that He assumed, while the
union preserved those things that were united just as they were united,
that is to say, not only the divine nature of Christ but also His human
nature, not only that which is above us but that which is of us. For He
was not first made like us and only later became higher than us, but
ever <span id="fr_2078"></span>[2079](#fn_2078.md) from His first coming
into being He existed with the double nature, because He existed in the
Word Himself from the beginning of the conception. Wherefore He is human
in His own nature, but also, in some marvellous manner, of God and
divine. Moreover He has the properties of the living flesh: for by
reason of the dispensation <span id="fr_2079"></span>[2080](#fn_2079.md)
the Word received these which are, according to the order of natural
motion, truly natural <span id="fr_2080"></span>[2081](#fn_2080.md) .
