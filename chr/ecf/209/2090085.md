<span id="iii.iv.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*Concerning Christ’s
two natures, in opposition to those who hold that He has only one* <span
id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.iii-p3"></span>For the two natures were united with
each other without change or alteration, neither the divine nature
departing from its native simplicity, nor yet the human being either
changed into the nature of God or reduced to non-existence, nor one
compound nature being produced out of the two. For the compound
nature <span id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962.md) cannot be of the same
essence as either of the natures out of which it is compounded, as made
one thing out of others: for example, the body is composed of the four
elements, but is not of the same essence as fire or air, or water or
earth, nor does it keep these names. If, therefore, after the union,
Christ’s nature was, as the heretics <span id="page_47b">p. 47b</span>
<span id="iii.iv.iii.iii-Page_47b"></span>hold, a compound unity, He had
changed from a simple into a compound nature <span
id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963.md) , and is not of the same essence as
the Father Whose nature is simple, nor as the mother, who is not a
compound of divinity and humanity. Nor will He then be in divinity and
humanity: nor will He be called either God or Man, but simply Christ:
and the word Christ will be the name not of the subsistence, but of what
in their view is the one nature.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.iii-p6"></span>We, however, do not give it as our
view that Christ’s nature is compound, nor yet that He is one thing made
of other things and differing from them as man is made of soul and body,
or as the body is made of the four elements, but hold <span
id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964.md) that, though He is constituted of
these different parts He is yet the same <span
id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965.md) . For we confess that He alike in
His divinity and in His humanity both is and is said to be perfect God,
the same Being, and that He consists of two natures, and exists in two
natures <span id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966.md) . Further, by the
word “Christ” we understand the name of the subsistence, not in the
sense of one kind, but as signifying the existence of two natures. For
in His own person He anointed Himself; as God anointing His body with
His own divinity, and as Man being anointed. For He is Himself both God
and Man. And the anointing is the divinity of His humanity. For if
Christ, being of one compound nature, is of like essence to the Father,
then the Father also must be compound and of like essence with the
flesh, which is absurd and extremely blasphemous <span
id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.iii-p11"></span>How, indeed, could one and the same
nature come to embrace opposing and essential differences? For how is it
possible that the same nature should be at once created and uncreated,
mortal and immortal, circumscribed and uncircumscribed?

<span id="iii.iv.iii.iii-p12"></span>But if those who declare that
Christ has only one nature should say also that that nature is a simple
one, they must admit either that He is God pure and simple, and thus
reduce the incarnation to a mere pretence, or that He is only man,
according to Nestorius. And how then about His being “perfect in
divinity and perfect in humanity”? And when can Christ be said to be of
two natures, if they hold that He is of one composite nature after the
union? For it is surely clear to every one that before the union
Christ’s nature was one.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.iii-p13"></span>But this is what leads the
heretics <span id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968.md) astray, viz., that
they look upon nature and subsistence as the same thing <span
id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969.md) . For when we speak of the nature
of men as one <span id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970.md) , observe that
in saying this we are not looking to the question of soul and body. For
when we compare together the soul and the body it cannot be said that
they are of one nature. But since there are very many subsistences of
men, and yet all have the same kind of nature <span
id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971.md) : for all are composed of soul and
body, and all have part in the nature of the soul, and possess the
essence of the body, and the common form: we speak of the one nature of
these very many and different subsistences; while each subsistence, to
wit, has two natures, and fulfils itself in two natures, namely, soul
and body.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.iii-p18"></span>But <span
id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972.md) a common form cannot be admitted in
the case of our Lord Jesus Christ. For neither was there ever, nor is
there, nor will there ever be another Christ constituted of deity and
humanity, and existing in deity and humanity at once perfect God and
perfect man. And thus in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ we cannot
speak of one nature made up of divinity and humanity, as we do in the
case of the individual made up of soul and body <span
id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973.md) . For in the latter case we have to
do with an individual, but Christ is not an individual. For there is no
predicable form of Christlihood, so to speak, that He possesses. And
therefore we hold that there has been a union of two perfect natures,
one divine and one human; not with disorder or confusion, or
intermixture <span id="fr_1974"></span>[1975](#fn_1974.md) , or
commingling, as is said by the God-accursed Dioscorus and by
Eutyches <span id="fr_1975"></span>[1976](#fn_1975.md) and Severus, and all
that impious company: and not in a personal or relative manner, or as a
matter of dignity or agreement in will, or equality in honour, or
identity in name, or good pleasure, as Nestorius, hated of God, said,
and Diodorus and Theodorus of Mopsuestia, and their diabolical tribe:
but by synthesis; that is, in subsistence, without change or confusion
or alteration or difference or separation, and we confess that in two
perfect natures there is but one subsistence of the Son of God
incarnate <span id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976.md) ; holding that
there is one and the same subsistence belong<span id="page_48b">p.
48b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iii.iii-Page_48b"></span>ing to His divinity
and His humanity, and granting that the two natures are preserved in Him
after the union, but we do not hold that each is separate and by itself,
but that they are united to each other in one compound subsistence. For
we look upon the union as essential, that is, as true and not imaginary.
We say that it is essential <span id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977.md) ,
moreover, not in the sense of two natures resulting in one compound
nature, but in the sense of a true union of them in one compound
subsistence of the Son of God, and we hold that their essential
difference is preserved. For the created remaineth created, and the
uncreated, uncreated: the mortal remaineth mortal; the immortal,
immortal: the circumscribed, circumscribed: the uncircumscribed,
uncircumscribed: the visible, visible: the invisible, invisible. “The
one part is all glorious with wonders: while the other is the victim of
insults <span id="fr_1978"></span>[1979](#fn_1978.md) .”

<span id="iii.iv.iii.iii-p26"></span>Moreover, the Word appropriates to
Himself the attributes of humanity: for all that pertains to His holy
flesh is His: and He imparts to the flesh His own attributes by way of
communication <span id="fr_1979"></span>[1980](#fn_1979.md) in virtue of
the interpenetration of the parts <span
id="fr_1980"></span>[1981](#fn_1980.md) one with another, and the oneness
according to subsistence, and inasmuch as He Who lived and acted both as
God and as man, taking to Himself either form and holding intercourse
with the other form, was one and the same <span
id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981.md) . Hence it is that the Lord of
Glory is said to have been crucified <span
id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982.md) , although His divine nature never
endured the Cross, and that the Son of Man is allowed to have been in
heaven before the Passion, as the Lord Himself said <span
id="fr_1983"></span>[1984](#fn_1983.md) . For the Lord of Glory is one and
the same with Him Who is in nature and in truth the Son of Man, that is,
Who became man, and both His wonders and His sufferings are known to us,
although His wonders were worked in His divine capacity, and His
sufferings endured as man. For we know that, just as is His one
subsistence, so is the essential difference of the nature preserved. For
how could difference be preserved if the very things that differ from
one another are not preserved? For difference is the difference between
things that differ. In so far as Christ’s natures differ from one
another, that is, in the matter of essence, we hold that Christ unites
in Himself two extremes: in respect of His divinity He is connected with
the Father and the Spirit, while in respect of His humanity He is
connected with His mother and all mankind. And in so far as His natures
are united, we hold that He differs from the Father and the Spirit on
the one hand, and from the mother and the rest of mankind on the other.
For the natures are united in His subsistence, having one compound
subsistence, in which He differs from the Father and the Spirit, and
also from the mother and us.
