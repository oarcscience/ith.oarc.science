<span id="iii.iv.iii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII</span>.—*Further
concerning volitions and free-wills: minds, too, and knowledges and
wisdoms.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xviii-p2"></span>When we say that Christ is perfect
God <span id="fr_2184"></span>[2185](#fn_2184.md) and perfect man, we
assuredly attribute to Him all the properties natural to both the Father
and mother. For He became man in order that that which was overcome
might overcome. For He Who was omnipotent did not in His omnipotent
authority and might lack the power to rescue man out of the hands of the
tyrant. But the tyrant would have had a ground of complaint if, after He
had overcome man, God should have used force against him. Wherefore God
in His pity and love for man wished to reveal fallen man himself as
conqueror, and became man to restore like with like.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xviii-p4"></span>But that man is a rational and
intelligent animal, no one will deny. How, then, could He have become
man if He took on Himself flesh without soul, or soul without mind? For
that is not man. Again, what benefit would His becoming man have been to
us if He Who suffered first was not saved, nor renewed and strengthened
by the union with divinity? For that which is not assumed is not
remedied. He, therefore, assumed the whole man, even the fairest part of
him, which had become diseased, in order that He might bestow salvation
on the whole. And, indeed, there could never exist a mind that had not
wisdom and was destitute of knowledge. For if it has not energy or
motion, it is utterly reduced to nothingness.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xviii-p5"></span>Therefore, God the Word <span
id="fr_2185"></span>[2186](#fn_2185.md) , wishing to restore that which was
in His own image, became man. But what is that which was in His own
image, unless mind? So He gave up the better and assumed the worse. For
mind <span id="fr_2186"></span>[2187](#fn_2186.md) is in the border-land
between God and flesh, for it dwells indeed in fellowship with the
flesh, and is, moreover, the image of God. Mind, then, mingles with
mind, and mind holds a place midway between the pureness of God and the
denseness of flesh. For if the Lord assumed a soul without mind, He
assumed the soul of an irrational animal.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xviii-p8"></span>But if the Evangelist said that
*the Word was made flesh* <span id="fr_2187"></span>[2188](#fn_2187.md) ,
note that in the Holy Scripture sometimes a man is spoken of as a soul,
as, for example, *with seventy-five souls came Jacob into Egypt* <span
id="fr_2188"></span>[2189](#fn_2188.md) : and sometimes a man is spoken of
as flesh, as, for example, *All flesh shall see the salvation of
God* <span id="fr_2189"></span>[2190](#fn_2189.md) . And accordingly the
Lord did not become flesh without soul or mind, but man. He says,
indeed, Himself, *Why seek ye to kill Me, a Man that hath told you the
truth* <span id="fr_2190"></span>[2191](#fn_2190.md) ? He, therefore,
assumed flesh animated with the spirit of reason and mind, a spirit that
holds sway <span id="page_67b">p. 67b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii.xviii-Page_67b"></span>over the flesh but is itself under
the dominion of the divinity of the Word.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xviii-p13"></span>So, then, He had by nature, both
as God and as man, the power of will. But His human will was obedient
and subordinate to His divine will, not being guided by its own
inclination, but willing those things which the divine will willed. For
it was with the permission of the divine will that He suffered by nature
what was proper to Him <span id="fr_2191"></span>[2192](#fn_2191.md) . For
when He prayed that He might escape the death, it was with His divine
will naturally willing and permitting it that He did so pray and agonize
and fear, and again when His divine will willed that His human will
should choose the death, the passion became voluntary to Him <span
id="fr_2192"></span>[2193](#fn_2192.md) . For it was not as God only, but
also as man, that He voluntarily surrendered Himself to the death. And
thus He bestowed on us also courage in the face of death. So, indeed, He
said before His saving passion, *Father, if it be possible, let this cup
pass from Me* <span id="fr_2193"></span>[2194](#fn_2193.md) ,” manifestly
as though He were to drink the cup as man and not as God. It was as man,
then, that He wished the cup to pass from Him: but these are the words
of natural timidity. *Nevertheless*, He said, *not My will*, that is to
say, not in so far as I am of a different essence from Thee, *but Thy
will be done* <span id="fr_2194"></span>[2195](#fn_2194.md) , that is to
say, My will and Thy will, in so far as I am of the same essence as
Thou. Now these are the words of a brave heart. For the Spirit of the
Lord, since He truly became man in His good pleasure, on first testing
its natural weakness was sensible of the natural fellow-suffering
involved in its separation from the body, but being strengthened by the
divine will it again grew bold in the face of death. For since He was
Himself wholly God although also man, and wholly man although also God,
He Himself as man subjected in Himself and by Himself His human nature
to God and the Father, and became obedient to the Father, thus making
Himself the most excellent type and example for us.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xviii-p18"></span>Of His own free-will, moreover,
He exercised His divine and human will. For free-will is assuredly
implanted in every rational nature. For to what end would it possess
reason, if it could not reason at its own free-will? For the Creator
hath implanted even in the unreasoning brutes natural appetite to compel
them to sustain their own nature. For devoid of reason, as they are,
they cannot guide their natural appetite but are guided by it. And so,
as soon as the appetite for anything has sprung up, straightway arises
also the impulse for action. And thus they do not win praise or
happiness for pursuing virtue, nor punishment for doing evil. But the
rational nature, although it does possess a natural appetite, can guide
and train it by reason wherever the laws of nature are observed. For the
advantage of reason consists in this, the free-will, by which we mean
natural activity in a rational subject. Wherefore in pursuing virtue it
wins praise and happiness, and in pursuing vice it wins punishment.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xviii-p19"></span>So that the soul <span
id="fr_2195"></span>[2196](#fn_2195.md) of the Lord being moved of its own
free-will willed, but willed of its free-will those things which His
divine will willed it to will. For the flesh was not moved at a sign
from the Word, as Moses and all the holy men were moved at a sign from
heaven. But He Himself, Who was one and yet both God and man, willed
according to both His divine and His human will. Wherefore it was not in
inclination but rather in natural power that the two wills of the Lord
differed from one another. For His divine will was without beginning and
all-effecting, as having power that kept pace with it, and free from
passion; while His human will had a beginning in time, and itself
endured the natural and innocent passions, and was not naturally
omnipotent. But yet it was omnipotent because it truly and naturally had
its origin in the God-Word.
