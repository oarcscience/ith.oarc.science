<span id="iii.iv.i.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Concerning things
utterable and things unutterable, and things knowable and thing
unknowable.*

<span id="iii.iv.i.ii-p2"></span>It is necessary, therefore, that one
who wishes to speak or to hear of God should understand clearly that
alike in the doctrine of Deity and in that of the Incarnation <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414) , neither are all things
unutterable nor all utterable; neither all unknowable nor all
knowable <span id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415) . But the knowable
belongs to one order, and the utterable to another; just as it is one
thing to speak and another thing to know. Many of the things relating to
God, therefore, that are dimly understood cannot be put into fitting
terms, but on things above us we cannot do else than express ourselves
according to our limited capacity; as, for instance, when we speak of
God we use the terms *sleep*, and *wrath*, and *regardlessness, hands*,
too, and *feet*, and such like expressions.

<span id="iii.iv.i.ii-p5"></span>We, therefore, both know and confess
that God is without beginning, without end, eternal and everlasting,
uncreate, unchangeable, invariable, simple, uncompound, incorporeal,
invisible, impalpable, uncircumscribed, infinite, incognisable,
indefinable, incomprehensible, good, just, maker of all things created,
almighty, all-ruling, all-surveying, of all overseer, sovereign, judge;
and that God is One, that <span id="page_2b">p. 2b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.i.ii-Page_2b"></span>is to say, one essence <span
id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416) ; and that He is known <span
id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417) , and has His being in three
subsistences, in Father, I say, and Son and Holy Spirit; and that the
Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit are one in all respects, except
in that of not being begotten, that of being begotten, and that of
procession; and that the Only-begotten Son and Word of God and God, in
His bowels of mercy, for our salvation, by the good pleasure of God and
the co-operation of the Holy Spirit, being conceived without seed, was
born uncorruptedly of the Holy Virgin and Mother of God, Mary, by the
Holy Spirit, and became of her perfect Man; and that the Same is at once
perfect God and perfect Man, of two natures, Godhead and Manhood, and in
two natures possessing intelligence, will and energy, and freedom, and,
in a word, perfect according to the measure and proportion proper to
each, at once to the divinity, I say, and to the humanity, yet to one
composite person <span id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418) ; and that
He suffered hunger and thirst and weariness, and was crucified, and for
three days submitted to the experience of death and burial, and ascended
to heaven, from which also He came to us, and shall come again. And the
Holy Scripture is witness to this and the whole choir of the Saints.

<span id="iii.iv.i.ii-p9"></span>But neither do we know, nor can we
tell, what the essence <span id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419) of God
is, or how it is in all, or how the Only-begotten Son and God, having
emptied Himself, became Man of virgin blood, made by another law
contrary to nature, or how He walked with dry feet upon the waters <span
id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420) . It is not within our capacity,
therefore, to say anything about God or even to think of Him, beyond the
things which have been divinely revealed to us, whether by word or by
manifestation, by the divine oracles at once of the Old Testament and of
the New <span id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421) .
