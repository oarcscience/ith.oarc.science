<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*Against the Jews
on the question of the Sabbath.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>The seventh day is called the
Sabbath and signifies rest. For in it God rested from all His
works <span id="fr_2639"></span>[2640](#fn_2639.md) , as the divine
Scripture says: and so the number of the days goes up to seven and then
circles back again and begins at the first. This is the precious number
with the Jews, God having ordained that it should be held in honour, and
that in no chance fashion but with the imposition of most heavy
penalties for the transgression <span
id="fr_2640"></span>[2641](#fn_2640.md) . And it was not in a simple
fashion that He ordained this, but for certain reasons understood
mystically by the spiritual and clear-sighted <span
id="fr_2641"></span>[2642](#fn_2641.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiii-p6"></span>So far, indeed, as I in my
ignorance know, to begin with inferior and more dense things, God,
knowing the denseness of the Israelites and their carnal love and
propensity towards matter in everything, made this law: first, in order
that *the servant and the cattle should rest* <span
id="fr_2642"></span>[2643](#fn_2642.md) as it is written, for *the
righteous man regardeth the life of his beast* <span
id="fr_2643"></span>[2644](#fn_2643.md) : next, in order that when they
take their ease from the distraction of material things, they may gather
together unto God, spending the whole of the seventh day in psalms and
hymns and spiritual songs and the study of the divine Scriptures and
resting in God. For when <span id="fr_2644"></span>[2645](#fn_2644.md) the
law did not exist and there was no divinely-inspired Scripture, the
Sabbath was not consecrated to God. But when the divinely-inspired
Scripture was given by Moses, the Sabbath was consecrated to God in
order that on it they, who do not dedicate their whole life to God, and
who do not make their desire subservient to the Master as though to a
Father, but are like foolish servants, may on that day talk much
concerning the exercise of it, and may abstract a small, truly a most
insignificant, portion of their life for the service of God, and this
from fear of the chastisements and punishments which threaten
transgressors. *For the law is not made for a righteous man but for the
unrighteous* <span id="fr_2645"></span>[2646](#fn_2645.md) . Moses, of a
truth, was the first to abide fasting with God for forty days and again
for another forty <span id="fr_2646"></span>[2647](#fn_2646.md) , and thus
doubtless to afflict himself with hunger on the Sabbaths although the
law forbade self-affliction on the Sabbath. But if they should object
that this took place before the law, what will they say about Elias the
Thesbite who accomplished a journey of forty days on one meal <span
id="fr_2647"></span>[2648](#fn_2647.md) ? For he, by thus afflicting
himself on the Sabbaths not only with hunger but with the forty days’
journeying, broke the Sabbath: and yet God, Who gave the law, was not
wroth with him but shewed Himself to him on Choreb as a reward for his
virtue. And what will they say about Daniel? Did he not spend three
weeks without food <span id="fr_2648"></span>[2649](#fn_2648.md) ? And
again, did not all Israel circumcise the child on the Sabbath, if it
happened to be the eighth day after birth <span
id="fr_2649"></span>[2650](#fn_2649.md) ? And do they not hold the great
fast which the law enjoins if it falls on the Sabbath <span
id="fr_2650"></span>[2651](#fn_2650.md) ? And further, do not the priests
and the Levites profane the Sabbath in the works of the tabernacle <span
id="fr_2651"></span>[2652](#fn_2651.md) and yet are held blameless? Yea, if
an ox should fall into a pit on the Sabbath, he who draws it forth is
blameless, while he who neglects to do so is condemned <span
id="fr_2652"></span>[2653](#fn_2652.md) . And did not all the Israelites
compass the walls of Jericho bearing the Ark of God for seven days, in
which assuredly the Sabbath was included <span
id="fr_2653"></span>[2654](#fn_2653.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiii-p19"></span>As I said <span
id="fr_2654"></span>[2655](#fn_2654.md) , therefore, for the purpose of
<span id="page_96b">p. 96b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxiii-Page_96b"></span>securing leisure to worship God in
order that they might, both servant and beast of burden, devote a very
small share to Him and be at rest, the observance of the Sabbath was
devised for the carnal that were still childish and *in the bonds of the
elements of the world* <span id="fr_2655"></span>[2656](#fn_2655.md) , and
unable to conceive of anything beyond the body and the letter. *But when
the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Only-begotten Son,
made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the
law that we might receive the adoption of sons* <span
id="fr_2656"></span>[2657](#fn_2656.md) . *For to as many of us as received
Him, He gave power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on
Him* <span id="fr_2657"></span>[2658](#fn_2657.md) *. So that we are no
longer servants but sons* <span id="fr_2658"></span>[2659](#fn_2658.md) :
no longer under the law but under grace: no longer do we serve God in
part from fear, but we are bound to dedicate to Him the whole span of
our life, and cause that servant, I mean wrath and desire, to cease from
sin and bid it devote itself to the service of God, always directing our
whole desire towards God and arming our wrath against the enemies of
God: and likewise we hinder that beast of burden, that is the body, from
the servitude of sin, and urge it forwards to assist to the uttermost
the divine precepts.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiii-p25"></span>These are the things which the
spiritual law of Christ enjoins on us and those who observe that become
superior to the law of Moses. *For when that which is perfect is come,
then that which is in part shall be done away* <span
id="fr_2659"></span>[2660](#fn_2659.md) : and when the covering of the law,
that is, the veil, is rent asunder through the crucifixion of the
Saviour, and the Spirit shines forth with tongues of fire, the letter
shall be done away with, bodily things shall come to an end, the law of
servitude shall be fulfilled, and the law of liberty be bestowed on us.
Yea <span id="fr_2660"></span>[2661](#fn_2660.md) we shall celebrate the
perfect rest of human nature, I mean the day after the resurrection, on
which the Lord Jesus, the Author of Life and our Saviour, shall lead us
into the heritage promised to those who serve God in the spirit, a
heritage into which He entered Himself as our forerunner after He rose
from the dead, and whereon, the gates of Heaven being opened to Him, He
took His seat in bodily form at the right hand of the Father, where
those who keep the spiritual law shall also come.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiii-p28"></span>What belongs to us <span
id="fr_2661"></span>[2662](#fn_2661.md) , therefore, who walk by the spirit
and not by the letter, is the complete abandonment of carnal things, the
spiritual service and communion with God. For circumcision is the
abandonment of carnal pleasure and of whatever is superfluous and
unnecessary. For the foreskin is nothing else than the skin which it
superfluous to the organ of lust. And, indeed, every pleasure which does
not arise from God nor is in God is superfluous to pleasure: and of that
the foreskin is the type. The Sabbath, moreover, is the cessation from
sin; so that both things happen to be one, and so both together, when
observed by those who are spiritual, do not bring about any breach of
the law at all.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiii-p30"></span>Further, observe <span
id="fr_2662"></span>[2663](#fn_2662.md) that the number seven denotes all
the present time, as the most wise Solomon says, to give a portion to
seven and also to eight <span id="fr_2663"></span>[2664](#fn_2663.md) . And
David <span id="fr_2664"></span>[2665](#fn_2664.md) , the divine singer
when he composed the eighth psalm, sang of the future restoration after
the resurrection from the dead. Since the Law, therefore, enjoined that
the seventh day should be spent in rest from carnal things and devoted
to spiritual things, it was a mystic indication to the true Israelite
who had a mind to see God, that he should through all time offer himself
to God and rise higher than carnal things.
