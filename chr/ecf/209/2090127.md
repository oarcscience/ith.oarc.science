<span id="iii.iv.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV</span>.—*Concerning the honour
due to the Saints and their remains.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xv-p2"></span>To the saints honour must be paid as
friends of Christ, as sons and heirs of God: in the words of John the
theologian and evangelist, *As many as received Him, to them gave He
power to became sons of God* <span id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465.md)
. *So that they are no longer servants, but sons: and if sons, also
heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ* <span
id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466.md) : and the Lord in the holy Gospels
says to His apostles, *Ye are My friends* <span
id="fr_2467"></span>[2468](#fn_2467.md) . *Henceforth I call you not
servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth* <span
id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468.md) . And further, if the Creator and
Lord of all things is called also King of Kings and Lord of Lords <span
id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469.md) and God of Gods, surely also the
saints are gods and lords and kings. For of these God is and is called
God and Lord and King. *For I am the God of Abraham*, He said to Moses,
*the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob* <span
id="fr_2470"></span>[2471](#fn_2470.md) . And God made Moses a god to
Pharaoh <span id="fr_2471"></span>[2472](#fn_2471.md) . Now I mean gods and
kings and lords not in nature, but as rulers and masters of their
passions, and as preserving a truthful likeness to the divine image
according to which they were made (for the image of a king is also
called king), and as being united to God of their own free-will and
receiving Him as an indweller and becoming by grace through
participation with Him what He is Himself by nature. Surely, then, the
worshippers and friends and sons of God are to be held in honour? For
the honour shewn to the most thoughtful of fellow-servants is a proof of
good feeling towards the common Master <span
id="fr_2472"></span>[2473](#fn_2472.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xv-p11"></span>These are made treasuries and pure
habitations of God: *For I will dwell in them,* <span id="page_87b">p.
87b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iv.xv-Page_87b"></span>said God, *and walk
in them, and I will be their God* <span
id="fr_2473"></span>[2474](#fn_2473.md) . The divine Scripture likewise
saith that the souls of the just are in God’s hand <span
id="fr_2474"></span>[2475](#fn_2474.md) and death cannot lay hold of them.
For death is rather the sleep of the saints than their death. *For they
travailed in this life and shall to the end* <span
id="fr_2475"></span>[2476](#fn_2475.md) , and *Precious in the sight of the
Lord is the death of His saints* <span
id="fr_2476"></span>[2477](#fn_2476.md) . What then, is more precious than
to be in the hand of God? For God is Life and Light, and those who are
in God’s hand are in life and light.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xv-p16"></span>Further, that God dwelt even in their
bodies in spiritual wise <span id="fr_2477"></span>[2478](#fn_2477.md) ,
the Apostle tells us, saying, *Know ye not that your bodies are the
temples of the Holy Spirit dwelling in you?* <span
id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478.md) , and The *Lord is that
Spirit* <span id="fr_2479"></span>[2480](#fn_2479.md) , and *If any one
destroy the temple of God, him will God destroy* <span
id="fr_2480"></span>[2481](#fn_2480.md) . Surely, then, we must ascribe
honour to the living temples of God, the living tabernacles of God.
These while they lived stood with confidence before God.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xv-p21"></span>The Master Christ made the remains of
the saints to be fountains of salvation to us, pouring forth manifold
blessings and abounding in oil of sweet fragrance: and let no one
disbelieve this <span id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481.md) . For if
water burst in the desert from the steep and solid rock at God’s
will <span id="fr_2482"></span>[2483](#fn_2482.md) and from the jaw-bone of
an ass to quench Samson’s thirst <span
id="fr_2483"></span>[2484](#fn_2483.md) , is it incredible that fragrant
oil should burst forth from the martyrs’ remains? By no means, at least
to those who know the power of God and the honour which He accords His
saints.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xv-p25"></span>In the law every one who toucheth a
dead body was considered impure <span
id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484.md) , but these are not dead. For from
the time when He that is Himself life and the Author of life was
reckoned among the dead, we do not call those dead who have fallen
asleep in the hope of the resurrection and in faith on Him. For how
could a dead body work miracles? How, therefore, are demons driven off
by them, diseases dispelled, sick persons made well, the blind restored
to sight, lepers purified, temptations and troubles overcome, and how
does every good gift from the Father of lights <span
id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485.md) come down through them to those who
pray with sure faith? How much labour would you not undergo to find a
patron to introduce you to a mortal king and speak to him on your
behalf? Are not those, then, worthy of honour who are the patrons of the
whole race, and make intercession to God for us? Yea, verily, we ought
to give honour to them by raising temples to God in their name, bringing
them fruit-offerings, honouring their memories and taking spiritual
delight in them, in order that the joy of those who call on us may be
ours, that in our attempts at worship we may not on the contrary cause
them offence. For those who worship God will take pleasure in those
things whereby God is worshipped, while His shield-bearers will be wrath
at those things wherewith God is wroth. In psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs <span id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486.md) , in
contrition and in pity for the needy, let us believers <span
id="fr_2487"></span>[2488](#fn_2487.md) worship the saints, as God also is
most worshipped in such wise. Let us raise monuments to them and visible
images, and let us ourselves become, through imitation of their virtues,
living monuments and images of them. Let us give honour to her who bore
God as being strictly and truly the Mother of God. Let us honour also
the prophet John as forerunner and baptist <span
id="fr_2488"></span>[2489](#fn_2488.md) , as apostle and martyr, *For among
them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the
Baptist* <span id="fr_2489"></span>[2490](#fn_2489.md) , as saith the Lord,
and he became the first to proclaim the Kingdom. Let us honour the
apostles as the Lord’s brothers, who saw Him face to face and ministered
to His passion, *for whom God the Father did foreknow He also did
predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son* <span
id="fr_2490"></span>[2491](#fn_2490.md) , *first apostles, second
prophets* <span id="fr_2491"></span>[2492](#fn_2491.md) , *third pastors
and teachers* <span id="fr_2492"></span>[2493](#fn_2492.md) . Let us also
honour the martyrs of the Lord chosen out of every class, as soldiers of
Christ who have drunk His cup and were then baptized with the baptism of
His life-bringing death, to be partakers of His passion and glory: of
whom the leader is Stephen, the first deacon of Christ and apostle and
first martyr. Also let us honour our holy fathers, the God-possessed
ascetics, whose struggle was the longer and more toilsome one of the
conscience: *who wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being
destitute, afflicted, tormented; they wandered in deserts and in
mountains and in dens and caves of the earth, of whom the world was not
worthy* <span id="fr_2493"></span>[2494](#fn_2493.md) . Let us honour those
who were prophets before grace, the patriarchs and just men who foretold
the Lord’s coming. Let us carefully review the life of these men, and
let us emulate their faith <span id="fr_2494"></span>[2495](#fn_2494.md)
and love and hope and zeal and way of life, and endurance of sufferings
and patience even to blood, in order that we may be sharers with them in
their crowns of glory.
