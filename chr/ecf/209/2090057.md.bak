<span id="iii.iv.ii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*Concerning the
Heaven.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.vi-p2"></span>The heaven is the circumference of
things created, both visible and invisible. For within its boundary are
included and marked off both the mental faculties of the angels and all
the world of sense. But the Deity alone is uncircumscribed, filling all
things, and surrounding all things, and bounding all things, for He is
above all things, and has created all things.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.vi-p3"></span>Since <span
id="fr_1682"></span>[1683](#fn_1682.md) , therefore, the Scripture speaks
of heaven, and heaven of heaven <span
id="fr_1683"></span>[1684](#fn_1683.md) , and heavens of heavens <span
id="fr_1684"></span>[1685](#fn_1684.md) , and the blessed Paul says that he
was snatched away to the third heaven <span
id="fr_1685"></span>[1686](#fn_1685.md) , we say that in the cosmogony of
the universe we accept the creation of a heaven which the foreign
philosophers, appropriating the views of Moses, call a starless sphere.
But further, God called the firmament also heaven <span
id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686.md) , which He commanded to be in the
midst of the waters, setting it to divide the waters that are above the
firmament from the waters that are below the firmament. And its nature,
according to the divine Basilius <span
id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687.md) , who is versed in the mysteries of
divine Scripture, is delicate as smoke. Others, however, hold that it is
watery in nature, since it is set in the midst of the waters: others say
it is composed of the four elements: and lastly, others speak of it as a
fifth body, distinct from the four elements <span
id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.vi-p11"></span>Further, some have thought that the
heaven encircles the universe and has the form of a sphere, and that
everywhere it is the highest point, and that the centre of the space
enclosed by it is the lowest part: and, further, that those bodies that
are light and airy are allotted by the Creator the upper region: while
those that are heavy and tend to descend occupy the lower region, which
is the middle. The element, then, that is lightest and most inclined to
soar upwards is fire, and hence they hold that its position is
immediately after the heaven, and they call it ether, and after it comes
the lower air. But earth and water, which are heavier and have more of a
downward tendency, are suspended in the centre. Therefore, taking them
in the reverse order, we have in the lowest situation earth and water:
but water is lighter than earth, and hence is more easily set in motion:
above these on all hands, like a covering, is the circle of air, and all
round the air is the circle of ether, and outside air is the circle of
the heaven.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.vi-p12"></span>Further, they say that the heaven
moves in a circle and so compresses all that is within it, that they
remain firm and not liable to fall asunder.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.vi-p13"></span>They say also that there are seven
zones of the heaven <span id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689.md) , one
higher than the other. And its nature, they say, is of extreme fineness,
like that of smoke, and each zone contains one of the planets. For there
are said to be seven planets: Sol, Luna, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, Venus
and Saturn. But sometimes Venus is called Lucifer and sometimes Vesper.
These are called planets because their movements are the reverse of
those of the heaven. For while the heaven and all other stars move from
east to west, these alone move from west to east. And this can easily be
seen in the case of the moon, which moves each evening a little
backwards.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.vi-p15"></span>All, therefore, who hold that the
heaven is in the form of a sphere, say that it is equally removed and
distant from the earth at all points, whether above, or sideways, or
below. And by ‘below’ and ‘sideways’ I mean all that comes within the
range of our senses. For it follows from what has been said, that the
heaven occupies the whole of the upper region and the earth the whole of
the lower. They say, besides, that the heaven encircles the earth in the
manner of a sphere, and bears along with it in its most rapid
revolutions sun, moon and stars, and that when the sun is over the earth
it becomes day there, and when it is under the earth it is <span
id="page_22b">p. 22b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.vi-Page_22b"></span>night. And, again, when the sun goes
under the earth it is night here, but day yonder.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.vi-p16"></span>Others have pictured the heaven as a
hemisphere. This idea is suggested by these words of David, the singer
of God, *Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain* <span
id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690.md) , by which word he clearly means a
tent: and by these from the blessed Isaiah, *Who hath established the
heavens like a vault* <span id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691.md) : and
also because when the sun, moon, and stars set they make a circuit round
the earth from west to north, and so reach once more the east <span
id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692.md) . Still, whether it is this way or
that, all things have been made and established by the divine command,
and have the divine will and counsel for a foundation that cannot be
moved. *For He Himself spoke and they were made: He Himself commanded
and they were created. He hath also established them for ever and ever:
He hath made a decree which will not pass* <span
id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.vi-p21"></span>The heaven of heaven, then, is the
first heaven which is above the firmament <span
id="fr_1694"></span>[1695](#fn_1694.md) . So here we have two heavens, for
God called the firmament also Heaven <span
id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695.md) . And it is customary in the divine
Scripture to speak of the air also as heavens, because we see it above
us. *Bless Him*, it says, *all ye birds of the heaven*, meaning of the
air. For it is the air and not the heaven that is the region in which
birds fly. So here we have three heavens, as the divine Apostle
said <span id="fr_1696"></span>[1697](#fn_1696.md) . But if you should wish
to look upon the seven zones as seven heavens there is no injury done to
the word of truth. For it is usual in the Hebrew tongue to speak of
heaven in the plural, that is, as heavens, and when a Hebrew wishes to
say heaven of heaven, he usually says heavens of heavens, and this
clearly means heaven of heaven <span
id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697.md) , which is above the firmament, and
the waters which are above the heavens, whether it is the air and the
firmament, or the seven zones of the firmament, or the firmament itself
which are spoken of in the plural as heavens according to the Hebrew
custom.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.vi-p26"></span>All things, then, which are brought
into existence are subject to corruption according to the law of their
nature <span id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698.md) , and so even the
heavens themselves are corruptible. But by the grace of God they are
maintained and preserved <span id="fr_1699"></span>[1700](#fn_1699.md) .
Only the Deity, however, is by nature without beginning and without
end <span id="fr_1700"></span>[1701](#fn_1700.md) . Wherefore it has been
said, *They will perish, but Thou dost endure* <span
id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701.md) : nevertheless, the heavens will
not be utterly destroyed. For they will wax old and be wound round as a
covering, and will be changed, and there will be a new heaven and a new
earth <span id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.vi-p32"></span>For the great part the heaven is
greater than the earth, but we need not investigate the essence of the
heaven, for it is quite beyond our knowledge.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.vi-p33"></span>It must not be supposed that the
heavens or the luminaries are endowed with life <span
id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703.md) . For they are inanimate and
insensible <span id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704.md) . So that when the
divine Scripture saith, *Let the heavens rejoice and the earth be
glad* <span id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705.md) , it is the angels in
heaven and the men on earth that are invited to rejoice. For the
Scripture is familiar with the figure of personification, and is wont to
speak of inanimate things as though they were animate: for example <span
id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706.md) , *The sea saw it and fled: Jordan
was driven back* <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707.md) . And again,
*What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou, O Jordan, that
thou was driven back* <span id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708.md) ?
Mountains, too, and hills are asked the reason of their leaping in the
same way as we are wont to say, the city was gathered together, when we
do not mean the buildings, but the inhabitants of the city: again, *the
heavens declare the glory of God* <span
id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709.md) , does not mean that they send
forth a voice that can be heard by bodily ears, but that from their own
greatness they bring before our minds the power of the Creator: and when
we contemplate their beauty we praise the Maker as the
Master-Craftsman <span id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710.md) .
