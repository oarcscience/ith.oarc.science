<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*Concerning angels.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p2"></span>He is Himself the Maker and Creator
of the angels: for He brought them out of nothing into being and created
them after His own image, an incorporeal race, a sort of spirit or
immaterial fire: in the words of the divine David, *He maketh His angels
spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire* <span
id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650.md) : and He has described their
lightness and the ardour, and <span id="page_19b">p. 19b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.iii-Page_19b"></span>heat, and keenness and sharpness with
which they hunger for God and serve Him, and how they are borne to the
regions above and are quite delivered from all material thought <span
id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p5"></span>An angel, then, is an intelligent
essence, in perpetual motion, with free-will, incorporeal, ministering
to God, having obtained by grace an immortal nature: and the Creator
alone knows the form and limitation of its essence. But all that we can
understand is, that it is incorporeal and immaterial. For all that is
compared with God Who alone is incomparable, we find to be dense and
material. For in reality only the Deity is immaterial and incorporeal.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p6"></span>The angel’s nature then is rational,
and intelligent, and endowed with free-will, changeable in will, or
fickle. For all that is created is changeable, and only that which is
un-created is unchangeable. Also all that is rational is endowed with
free-will. As it is, then, rational and intelligent, it is endowed with
free-will: and as it is created, it is changeable, having power either
to abide or progress in goodness, or to turn towards evil.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p7"></span>It is not susceptible of repentance
because it is incorporeal. For it is owing to the weakness of his body
that man comes to have repentance.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p8"></span>It is immortal, not by nature <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652.md) but by grace <span
id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653.md) . For all that has had beginning
comes also to its natural end. But God alone is eternal, or rather, He
is above the Eternal: for He, the Creator of times, is not under the
dominion of time, but above time.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p11"></span>They are secondary intelligent
lights derived from that first light which is without beginning, for
they have the power of illumination; they have no need of tongue or
hearing, but without uttering words <span
id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654.md) they communicate to each other
their own thoughts and counsels <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p14"></span>Through the Word, therefore, all the
angels were created, and through the sanctification by the Holy Spirit
were they brought to perfection, sharing each in proportion to his worth
and rank in brightness and grace <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p16"></span>They are circumscribed: for when
they are in the Heaven they are not on the earth: and when they are sent
by God down to the earth they do not remain in the Heaven. They are not
hemmed in by walls and doors, and bars and seals, for they are quite
unlimited. Unlimited, I repeat, for it is not as they really are that
they reveal themselves to the worthy men <span
id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657.md) to whom God wishes them to appear,
but in a changed form which the beholders are capable of seeing. For
that alone is naturally and strictly unlimited which is un-created. For
every created thing is limited by God Who created it.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p18"></span>Further, apart from their essence
they receive the sanctification from the Spirit: through the divine
grace they prophesy <span id="fr_1658"></span>[1659](#fn_1658.md) : they
have no need of marriage for they are immortal.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p20"></span>Seeing that they are minds they are
in mental places <span id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659.md) , and are
not circumscribed after the fashion of a body. For they have not a
bodily form by nature, nor are they extended in three dimensions. But to
whatever post they may be assigned, there they are present after the
manner of a mind and energise, and cannot be present and energise in
various places at the same time.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p22"></span>Whether they are equals in essence
or differ from one another we know not. God, their Creator, Who knoweth
all things, alone knoweth. But they differ <span
id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660.md) from each other in brightness and
position, whether it is that their position is dependent on their
brightness, or their brightness on their position: and they impart
brightness to one another, because they excel one another in rank and
nature <span id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661.md) . And clearly the
higher share their brightness and knowledge with the lower.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p25"></span>They are mighty and prompt to fulfil
the will of the Deity, and their nature is endowed with such celerity
that wherever the Divine glance bids them there they are straightway
found. They are the guardians of the divisions of the earth: they are
set over nations and regions, allotted to them by their Creator: they
govern all our affairs and bring us succour. And the reason surely is
because they are set over us by the divine will and command and are ever
in the vicinity of God <span id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p27"></span>With difficulty they are moved to
evil, yet they are not absolutely immoveable: but now they are
altogether immoveable, not by nature but by grace and by their nearness
to the Only Good <span id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p29"></span>They behold God according to their
capacity, and this is their food <span
id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p31"></span>They are above us for they are
incorporeal, and are free of all bodily passion, yet are not
passionless: for the Deity alone is passionless.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p32"></span><span id="page_20b">p. 20b</span>
<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-Page_20b"></span>They take different forms at
the bidding of their Master, God, and thus reveal themselves to men and
unveil the divine mysteries to them.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p33"></span>They have Heaven for their
dwelling-place, and have one duty, to sing God’s praise and carry out
His divine will.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p34"></span>Moreover, as that most holy, and
sacred, and gifted theologian, Dionysius the Areopagite <span
id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665.md) , says, All theology, that is to
say, the holy Scripture, has nine different names for the heavenly
essences <span id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666.md) . These essences
that divine master in sacred things divides into three groups, each
containing three. And the first group, he says, consists of those who
are in God’s presence and are said to be directly and immediately one
with Him, viz., the Seraphim with their six wings, the many-eyed
Cherubim and those that sit in the holiest thrones. The second group is
that of the Dominions, and the Powers, and the Authorities; and the
third, and last, is that of the Rulers and Archangels and Angels.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p37"></span>Some, indeed <span
id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667.md) , like Gregory the Theologian, say
that these were before the creation of other things. He thinks that the
angelic and heavenly powers were first and that thought was their
function <span id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668.md) . Others, again,
hold that they were created after the first heaven was made. But all are
agreed that it was before the foundation of man. For myself, I am in
harmony with the theologian. For it was fitting that the mental essence
should be the first created, and then that which can be perceived, and
finally man himself, in whose being both parts are united.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iii-p40"></span>But those who say that the angels
are creators of any kind of essence whatever are the mouth of their
father, the devil. For since they are created things they are not
creators. But He Who creates and provides for and maintains all things
is God, Who alone is uncreate and is praised and glorified in the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
