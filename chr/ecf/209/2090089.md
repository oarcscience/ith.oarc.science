<span id="iii.iv.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—</span>*Concerning the one
compound subsistence of God the Word.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.vii-p2"></span>We hold then that the divine
subsistence of God the Word existed before all else and is without time
and eternal, simple and uncompound, uncreated, incorporeal, invisible,
intangible, uncircumscribed, possessing all the Father possesses, since
He is of the same essence with Him, differing from the Father’s
subsistence in the manner of His generation and the relation of the
Father’s subsistence, being perfect also and at no time separated from
the Father’s subsistence: and in these last days, without leaving the
Father’s bosom, took up His abode in an uncircumscribed manner in the
womb of the holy Virgin, without the instrumentality of seed, and in an
incomprehensible manner known only to Himself, and causing the flesh
derived from the holy Virgin to subsist in the very subsistence that was
before all the ages.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.vii-p3"></span>So then He was both in all things
and above all things and also dwelt in the womb of the holy Mother of
God, but in it by the energy of the incarnation. He therefore became
flesh and He took upon Himself thereby the first-fruits of our compound
nature <span id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014.md) , viz., the flesh
animated with the intelligent and national soul, so that the very
subsistence of God the Word was changed into the subsistence of the
flesh, and the subsistence of the Word, which was formerly simple,
became compound <span id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015.md) , yea
compounded of two perfect natures, divinity and humanity, and bearing
the characteristic and distinctive property of the divine Sonship of God
the Word in virtue of which it is distinguished from the Father and the
Spirit, and also the characteristic and distinctive properties of the
flesh, in virtue of which it differs from the Mother and the rest of
mankind, bearing further the properties of the divine nature in virtue
of which it is united to the Father and the Spirit, and the marks of the
human nature in virtue of which it is united to the Mother and to us.
And further it differs from the Father and the Spirit and the Mother and
us in being at once God and man. For this we know to be the most special
property of the subsistence of Christ.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.vii-p6"></span>Wherefore we confess Him, even after
the incarnation, the one Son of God, and likewise Son of Man, one
Christ, one Lord, the only-begotten Son and Word of God, one Lord Jesus.
We reverence His two generations, one from the Father before time and
beyond cause and reason and time and nature, and one in the end for our
sake, and like to us and above us; for our sake because it was for our
salvation, like to us in that He was man born of woman <span
id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016.md) at full time <span
id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017.md) , and above us because it was not
by seed, but by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Virgin Mary <span
id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018.md) , transcending the laws of
parturition. We proclaim Him not as God only, devoid of our humanity,
nor yet as man only, stripping Him of His divinity, nor as two distinct
persons, but as one and the same, at once God and man, perfect God and
perfect man, wholly God and wholly man, the same being wholly God, even
though He was also <span id="page_52b">p. 52b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii.vii-Page_52b"></span>flesh and wholly man, even though He
was also most high God. And by “perfect God” and “perfect man” we mean
to emphasize the fulness and unfailingness of the natures: while by
“wholly God” and “wholly man” we mean to lay stress on the singularity
and individuality of the subsistence.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.vii-p10"></span>And we confess also that there is
one incarnate nature of God the Word, expressing by the word
“incarnate <span id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019.md) ” the essence of
the flesh, according to the blessed Cyril <span
id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020.md) . And so the Word was made flesh
and yet did not abandon His own proper immateriality: He became wholly
flesh and yet remained wholly uncircumscribed. So far as He is body He
is diminished and contracted into narrow limits, but inasmuch as He is
God He is uncircumscribed, His flesh not being coextensive with His
uncircumscribed divinity.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.vii-p13"></span>He is then wholly perfect God, but
yet is not simply <span id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021.md) God: for He
is not only God but also man. And He is also wholly <span
id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022.md) perfect man but not simply <span
id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023.md) man, for He is not only man but
also God. For “simply <span id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024.md) ” here
has reference to His nature, and “wholly <span
id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025.md) ” to His subsistence, just as
“another thing” would refer to nature, while “another <span
id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026.md) ” would refer to subsistence <span
id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.vii-p21"></span>But observe <span
id="fr_2028"></span>[2029](#fn_2028.md) that although we hold that the
natures of the Lord permeate one another, yet we know that the
permeation springs from the divine nature. For it is that that
penetrates and permeates all things, as it wills, while nothing
penetrates it: and it is it, too, that imparts to the flesh its own
peculiar glories, while abiding itself impossible and without
participation in the affections of the flesh. For if the sun imparts to
us his energies and yet does not participate in ours, how much the
rather must this be true of the Creator and Lord of the Sun <span
id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029.md) .
