<span id="iii.iv.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*Concerning the number
of the Natures.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.v-p2"></span>In the case, therefore, of the
Godhead <span id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992) we confess that there
is but one nature, but hold that there are three subsistences actually
existing, and hold that all things that are of nature and essence are
simple, and recognise the difference of the subsistences only in the
three properties of independence of cause and Fatherhood, of dependence
on cause and Sonship, of dependence on cause and procession <span
id="fr_1993"></span>[1994](#fn_1993) . And we know further that these
are indivisible and inseparable from each other and united into one, and
interpenetrating one another without confusion. Yea, I repeat, united
without confusion, for they are three although united, and they are
distinct, although inseparable. For although each has an independent
existence, that is to say, is a perfect subsistence and has an
individuality of its own, that is, has a special mode of existence, yet
they are one in essence and in the natural properties, and in being
inseparable and indivisible from the Father’s subsistence, and they both
are and are said to be one God. In the very same way, then, in the case
of the divine and ineffable dispensation <span
id="fr_1994"></span>[1995](#fn_1994) , exceeding all thought and
comprehension, I mean the Incarnation of the One God the Word of the
Holy Trinity, and our Lord Jesus Christ, we confess that there are two
natures, one divine and one human, joined together with one another and
united in subsistence <span id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995) , so
that one compound subsistence is formed out of the two natures: but we
hold that the two natures are still preserved, even after the union, in
the one compound subsistence, that is, in the one Christ, and that these
exist in reality and have their natural properties; for they are united
without confusion, and are distinguished and enumerated without being
separable. And just as the three subsistences of the Holy Trinity are
united without confusion, and are distinguished and enumerated without
being separable <span id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996) , the
enumeration not entailing division or separation or alienation or
cleavage among them (for we recognise one God the Father, the Son and
the Holy Spirit), so in the same way the natures of Christ also,
although they are united, yet are united without confusion; and although
they interpenetrate one another, yet they do not permit of change or
transmutation of one into the other <span
id="fr_1997"></span>[1998](#fn_1997) . For each keeps its own natural
individuality strictly unchanged. And thus it is that they can be
enumerated without the enumeration introducing division. For Christ,
indeed, is one, perfect both in divinity and in humanity. For it is not
the nature of number to cause separation or unity, but its nature is to
indicate the quantity of what is enumerated, whether these are united or
separated: for we have unity, for instance, when fifty stones compose a
wall, but we have separation when the fifty stones lie on the ground;
and again, we have unity when we speak of coal having two natures,
namely, fire and wood, but we have separation in that the nature of fire
is one thing, and the nature of wood another thing; <span
id="page_50b">p. 50b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iii.v-Page_50b"></span>for
these things are united and separated not by number, but in another way.
So, then, just as even though the three subsistences of the Godhead are
united with each other, we cannot speak of them as one subsistence
because we should confuse and do away with the difference between the
subsistences, so also we cannot speak of the two natures of Christ as
one nature, united though they are in subsistence, because we should
then confuse and do away with and reduce to nothing the difference
between the two natures.
