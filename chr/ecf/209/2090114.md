id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Concerning the sitting
at the right hand of the Father.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ii-p2"></span>We hold, moreover, that Christ sits in
the body at the right hand of God the Father, but we do not hold that
the right hand of the Father is actual place. For how could He that is
uncircumscribed have a right hand limited by place? Right hands and left
hands belong to what is circumscribed. But we understand the right hand
of the Father to be the glory and honour of the Godhead in which the Son
of God, who existed as God before the ages, and is of like essence to
the Father, and in the end became flesh, has a seat in the body, His
flesh sharing in the glory. For He along with His flesh is adored with
one adoration by all creation <span id="fr_2254"></span>[2255](#fn_2254)

do service to the creature in worshipping created nature, or ye say that
there is one nature to be worshipped, and another not to be
worshipped.”](2090115)
