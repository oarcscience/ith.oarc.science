<span id="iii.ii-p3"></span>In the difficult task of translating the *De
Fide Orthodoxa*—a task made the more difficult at times by the condition
of the text,—I am indebted for much to my son, James L. Salmond, M.A.,
M.B., formerly of Balliol College, Oxford. There still remain passages
of doubtful interpretation. It was intended to furnish a larger body of
Notes and also an account of John and his writings. It has been found
advisable, however, to complete the volume without these.
