<span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lviii"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Theology of St. Hilary of
Poitiers.</span>

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>This</span> Chapter offers no more than a
tentative and imperfect outline of the theology of St. Hilary; it is an
essay, not a monograph. Little attempt will be made to estimate the
value of his opinions from the point of view of modern thought; little
will be said about his relation to earlier and contemporary thought, a
subject on which he is habitually silent, and nothing about the after
fate of his speculations. Yet the task, thus narrowed, is not without
its difficulties. Much more attention, it is true, has been paid to
Hilary’s theology than to the history of his life, and the student
cannot presume to dispense with the assistance of the books already
written <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) . But they cannot
release him from the necessity of collecting evidence for himself from
the pages of Hilary, and of forming his own judgment upon it, for none
of them can claim completeness and they differ widely as to the views
which Hilary held. There is the further difficulty that a brief
statement of a theologian’s opinions must be systematic. But Hilary has
abstained, perhaps deliberately, from constructing a system; the
scattered points of his teaching must be gathered from writings composed
at various times and with various purposes. The part of his work which
was, no doubt, most useful in his own day, his summary in the *De
Trinitate* of the defence against Arianism, is clear and well arranged,
but it bears less of the stamp of Hilary’s genius than any other of his
writings. His characteristic thoughts are scattered over the pages of
this great controversial treatise, where the exigencies of his immediate
argument often deny him full scope for their development; or else they
must be sought in his Commentary on St. Matthew, where they find
incidental expression in the midst of allegorical exegesis; or again,
amid the mysticism and exhortation of the *Homilies on the Psalms*. It
is in some of these last that the Christology of Hilary is most
completely stated; but the Homilies were intended for a general
audience, and are unsystematic in construction and almost conversational
in tone. Hilary has never worked out his thoughts in consistent
theological form, and many of the most original among them have failed
to attract the attention which they would have received had they been
presented in such a shape as that of the later books of the *De
Trinitate*.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p4"></span>This desultory mode of composition had
its advantages in life and warmth of present interest, and gives to
Hilary’s writings a value as historical documents which a formal and
comprehensive treatise would have lacked. But it seriously increases the
difficulty of the present undertaking. It was inevitable that Hilary’s
method, though he is a singularly consistent thinker, should sometimes
lead him into self-contradiction and sometimes leave his meaning in
obscurity. In such cases probabilities must be balanced, with due regard
to the opinion of former theologians who have studied his writings, and
a definite conclusion must be given, though space cannot be found for
the considerations upon which it is based. But though the writer may be
satisfied that he has, on the whole, fairly represented Hilary’s belief,
it is impossible that a summary of doctrine can be an adequate
reflection of a great teacher’s mind. Proportions are altogether
changed; a doctrine once stated and then dismissed must be set down on
the same scale as another to which the author recurs again <span
id="page_lix">p. lix</span> <span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lix"></span>and
again with obvious interest. The inevitable result is an apparent
coldness and stiffness and excess of method which does Hilary an
injustice both as a thinker and as a writer. In the interests of orderly
sequence not only must he be represented as sometimes more consistent
than he really is, but the play of thought, the undeveloped suggestions,
often brilliant in their originality, the striking expression given to
familiar truths, must all be sacrificed, and with the great part of the
pleasure and profit to be derived from his writings. For there are two
conclusions which the careful student will certainly reach; the one that
every statement and argument will be in hearty and scrupulous consonance
with the Creeds, the other that, within this limit, he must not be
surprised at any ingenuity or audacity of logic or exegesis in
explanation and illustration of recognised truths, and especially in the
speculative connection of one truth with another. But the evidence that
Hilary’s heart, as well as his reason, was engaged in the search and
defence of truth must be sought, where it will be abundantly found, in
the translations given in this volume. The present chapter only purposes
to set out, in a very prosaic manner, the conclusions at which his
speculative genius arrived, working as it did by the methods of strict
logic in the spirit of eager loyalty to the Faith.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p5"></span>In his effort to render a reason for his
belief Hilary’s constant appeal is to Scripture; and he avails himself
freely of the thoughts of earlier theologians. But he never makes
himself their slave; he is not the avowed adherent of any school, and
never cites the names of those whose arguments he adopts. These he
adjusts to his own system of thought, and presents for acceptance, not
on authority, but on their own merits. For Scripture, however, he has an
unbounded reverence. Everything that he believes, save the fundamental
truth of Theism, of which man has an innate consciousness, being unable
to gaze upon the heavens without the conviction that God exists and has
His home there <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) , is directly
derived from Holy Scripture. Scripture for Hilary means the Septuagint
for the Old Testament, the Latin for the New. He was, as we saw, no
Hebrew Scholar, and had small respect either for the versions which
competed with the Septuagint or for the Latin rendering of the old
Testament, but there is little evidence <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) that he was dissatisfied with the
Latin of the New; in fact, in one instance, whether through habitual
contentment with his Latin or through momentary carelessness in
verifying the sense, he bases an argument on a thoroughly false
interpretation <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) . Of his relation
to Origen and the literary aspects of his exegetical work, something has
been said in the former chapter. Here we must speak of his use of
Scripture as the source of truth, and of the methods he employs to draw
out its meaning.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p9"></span>In Hilary’s eyes the two Testaments form
one homogeneous revelation, of equal value throughout <span
id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) , and any part of the whole may be
used in explanation of any other part. The same title of *beatissimus*
is given to Daniel and to St. Paul when both are cited in *Comm. in
Matt*. xxv. 3; indeed, he and others of his day seem to have felt that
the Saints of the Old Covenant were as near to themselves as those of
the New. Not many years had passed since Christians were accustomed to
encourage themselves to martyrdom, in default of well-known heroes of
their own faith, by the example of Daniel and his companions, or of the
Seven Maccabees and their Mother. But Scripture is not only harmonious
throughout, as Origen had taught; it is also never otiose. It never
repeats itself, and a significance must be sought not only in the
smallest differences of language, but also in the order in which
apparent synonyms occur <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) ; in
fact, every detail, and every sense <span id="page_lx">p. lx</span>
<span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lx"></span>in which every detail may be
interpreted, is a matter for profitable enquiry <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) . Hence, the text of Scripture not
only bears, but demands, the most strict and literal interpretation.
Hilary’s explanation of the words, ‘My soul is sorrowful even unto
death,’ in *Tract. in Ps*. cxli. 8 and *Trin*. x. 36, is a remarkable
instance of his method <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) ; as is
the argument from the words of Isaiah, ‘We *esteemed* Him stricken,’
that this, so far as it signifies an actual sense of pain in Christ, is
only an opinion, and a false one <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md)
. Similarly the language of St. Paul about the treasures of knowledge
hidden in Christ is made to prove His omniscience on earth. Whatever is
hidden is present in its hiding-place; therefore Christ could not be
ignorant <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) . But this close
adherence to the text of Scripture is combined with great boldness in
its interpretation. Hilary does not venture, with Origen, to assert that
some passages of Scripture have no literal sense, but he teaches that
there are cases when its statements have no meaning in relation to the
circumstances in which they were written <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) , and uses this to enforce the
doctrine, which he holds as firmly as Origen, that the spiritual meaning
is the only one of serious importance <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) . All religious truth is contained in
Scripture, and it is our duty to be ignorant of what lies outside
it <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) . But within the limits of
Scripture the utmost liberty of inference is to be admitted concerning
the purpose with which the words were written and the sense to be
attached to them. Sometimes, and especially in his later writings, when
Hilary was growing more cautious and weaning himself from the influence
of Origen, we are warned to be careful, not to read too much of definite
dogmatic truth into every passage, to consider the context and
occasion <span id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) . Elsewhere, but this
especially in that somewhat immature and unguarded production, the
Commentary on St. Matthew, we find a purpose and meaning, beyond the
natural sense, educed by such considerations as that, while all the
Gospel is true, its facts are often so stated as to be a prophecy as
well as a history; or that part of an event is sometimes suppressed in
the narrative in order to make the whole more perfect as a
prophecy <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) . But he can derive a
lesson not merely from what Scripture says but also from the
discrepancies between the Septuagint as an independent and inspired
authority for the revelation of the Old Testament. Its translators are
‘those seventy elders who had a knowledge of the Law and of the Prophets
which transcends the limitations and doubtfulness of the letter <span
id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) . His confidence in their work, which
is not exceeded by that of St. Augustine, encourages him to draw lessons
from the differences between the Hebrew and the Septuagint titles of the
Psalms. For instance, [Psalm
cxlii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#000.md)<span
id="ii.iii.ii-p21.1"></span> has been furnished in the Septuagint with a
title which attributes it to David when pursued by Absalom. The contents
of the Psalm are appropriate neither to the circumstances nor to the
date. But this does not justify us in ignoring the title. We must regard
the fact that a wrong connection is given to the Psalm as a warning to
ourselves not to attempt to discover its historical position, but
confine ourselves to its spiritual sense. And this is not all. Another
Psalm, the third, is assigned in the Hebrew to the same king in the same
distress. But, though this attribution is certainly correct, here also
we must follow the leading of the Septuagint, which was led to give a
wrong title to one Psalm lest we should attach importance to the correct
title of another. In both cases we must fix our attention not on the
afflictions of David, but on the sorrows of Christ. Thus, negatively if
not positively, the Septuagint must guide our judgement <span
id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) . But Hilary often goes even further,
and ventures upon a purely subjective <span id="page_lxi">p. lxi</span>
<span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxi"></span>interpretation, which sometimes
gives useful insight into the modes of thought of Gaul in the fourth
century. For instance, he is thoroughly classical in taking it for
granted that the Psalmist’s words, ‘I will lift up mine eyes unto the
hills,’ cannot refer to the natural feature; that he can never mean the
actual mountains bristling with woods, the naked rocks and pathless
precipices and frozen snows <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) .
And even Gregory the Great could not surpass the prosaic grotesqueness
with which Hilary declares it impious to suppose that God would feed the
young ravens, foul carrion birds <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md)
; and that the lilies of the Sermon on the Mount must be explained away,
because they wear no clothing, and because, as a matter of fact, it is
quite possible for men to be more brightly attired than they <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) . Examples of such reasoning, more or
less extravagant, might be multiplied from Hilary’s exegetical writings;
passages in which no allowance is made for Oriental imagery, for poetry
or for rhetoric <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p27"></span>But though Hilary throughout his whole
period of authorship uses the mystical method of interpretation, never
doubting that everywhere in Scripture there is a spiritual meaning which
can be elicited, and that whatever sense, consistent with truth
otherwise ascertained, can be extracted from it, may be extracted, yet
there is a manifest increase in sobriety in his later as compared with
his earlier writings. From the riotous profusion of mysticisms in the
commentary on St. Matthew, where, for instance, every character and
detail in the incident of St. John Baptist’s death becomes a symbol, it
is a great advance to the almost Athanasian cautiousness in exegesis of
the *De Trinitate*; though even here, especially in the early books
which deal with the Old Testament, there is some extravagance and a very
liberal employment of the method <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md)
. His reasons, when he gives them, are those adduced in his other
writings; the inappropriateness of the words to the time when they were
written, or the plea that reverence or reason bids us penetrate behind
the letter. His increasing caution is due to no distrust of the
principle of mysticism.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p29"></span>Though Hilary was not its inventor, and
was forced by the large part played by Old Testament exegesis in the
Arian controversy to employ it, whether he would or not <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) , yet it is certain that his hearty,
though not indiscriminate <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) ,
acceptance of the method led to its general adoption in the West.
Tertullian and Cyprian had made no great use of such speculations;
Irenæus probably had little influence. It was the introduction of
Origen’s thought to Latin Christendom by Hilary and his contemporaries
which set the fashion, and none of them can have had such influence as
Hilary himself. It is a strange irony of fate that so deep and original
a thinker should have exerted his most permanent influence not through
his own thoughts, but through this dubious legacy which he handed on
from Alexandria to Europe. Yet within certain limits, it was a sound
and, for that age, even a scientific method; and Hilary might at least
plead that he never allowed the system to be his master, and that it was
a means which enabled him to derive from Scriptures which otherwise, to
him, would be unprofitable, some treasure of true and valuable
instruction. It never moulds his thoughts; at the most, he regards it as
a useful auxiliary. No praise can be too high for his wise and sober
marshalling not so much of texts as of the collective evidence of
Scripture concerning the relation of the Father and the Son in the *De
Trinitate*; and if his Christology be not equally convincing, it is not
the fault of his method, but of its application <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) . <span id="page_lxii">p. lxii</span>
<span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxii"></span>We cannot wonder that Hilary, who
owed his clear dogmatic convictions to a careful and independent study
of Scripture, should have wished to lead others to the same source of
knowledge. He couples it with the Eucharist as a second Table of the
Lord, a public means of grace, which needs, if it is to profit the
hearer, the same preparation of a pure heart and life <span
id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) . Attention to the lessons read in
church is a primary duty, but private study of Scripture is enforced
with equal earnestness <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) . It must
be for all, as Hilary had found it for himself, a privilege as well as a
duty.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p35"></span>His sense of the value of Scripture is
heightened by his belief in the sacredness of language. Names belong
inseparably to the things which they signify; words are themselves a
revelation. This is a lesson learnt from Origen; and the false
antithesis between the nature and the name of God, of which, according
to the Arians, Christ had the latter only, made it of special use to
Hilary <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) . But if this high
dignity belongs to every statement of truth, there is the less need for
technical terms of theology. The rarity of their occurrence in the pages
of Hilary has already been mentioned. ‘Trinity’ <span
id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) is almost absent, and ‘Person’ <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) hardly more common, he prefers, by a
turn of language which would scarcely be seemly in English, to speak of
the ‘embodied’ Christ and of His ‘Embodiment,’ though Latin theology was
already familiar with the ‘Incarnation <span
id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) .’ In fact, it would seem that he had
resolved to make himself independent of technical terms and of such
lines of thought as would require them. But he is never guilty of
confusion caused by an inadequate vocabulary. He has the literary skill
to express in ordinary words ideas which are very remote from ordinary
thought, and this at no inordinate length. No one, for instance, has
developed the idea of the mutual indwelling of Father and Son more fully
and clearly than he; yet he has not found it necessary to employ or
devise the monstrous ‘circuminsession’ or ‘perichoresis’ of later
theology. And where he does use terms of current theology, or rather
metaphysic, he shews that he is their master, not their slave. The most
important idea of this kind which he had to express was that of the
Divine substance. The word ‘essence’ is entirely rejected <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) ; ‘substance’ and ‘nature’ are freely
used as synonyms, but in such alternation that both of them still
obviously belong to the sphere of literature, and not of science. They
are twice used as exact alternatives, for the avoidance of monotony, in
parallel clauses of *Trin*. vi. 18, 19. So also the nature of fire in
vii. 29 is not an abstraction; and in ix. 36 *fin*. the Divine substance
and nature are equivalents. These are only a few of many instances <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) . Here, as always, there is an
abstention from abstract thoughts and terms, which indicates, on the
part of a student of philosophy and of philosophical theology, a
deliberate narrowing of his range of speculation. We may illustrate the
purpose of Hilary by comparing his method with that of the author of a
treatise on Astronomy without Mathematics. But some part of his caution
is probably due to his sense of <span id="page_lxiii">p. lxiii</span>
<span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxiii"></span>the inadequacy of the terms with
which Latin theology was as yet equipped, and of the danger, not only to
his readers’ faith, but to his own reputation for orthodoxy, which might
result from ingenuity in the employment or invention of technical
language.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p42"></span>Though, as we have seen, the
contemplative state is not the ultimate happiness of man, yet the
knowledge of God is essential to salvation <span
id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) ; man, created in God’s image, is by
nature capable of, and intended for, such knowledge, and Christ came to
impart it, the necessary condition on the side of humanity being purity
of mind <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) , and the result the
elevation of man to the life of God. Hilary does not shrink from the
emphatic language of the Alexandrian school, which spoke of the
‘deification’ of man; God, he says, was born to be man, in order that
man might be born to be God <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) . If
this end is to be attained, obviously what is accepted as knowledge must
be true; hence the supreme wickedness of heresy, which destroys the
future of mankind by palming upon them error for truth; the greater
their dexterity the greater, because the more deliberate, their crime.
And Hilary was obviously convinced that his opponents had conceived this
nefarious purpose. It is not in the language of mere conventional
polemics, but in all sincerity, that he repeatedly describes them as
liars who cannot possibly be ignorant of the facts which they
misrepresent, inventors of sophistical arguments and falsifiers of the
text of Scripture, conscious that their doom is sealed, and endeavouring
to divert their minds from the thought of future misery by involving
others in their own destruction <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md)
. He fully recognises the ability and philosophical learning displayed
by them; it only makes their case the worse, and, after all, is merely
folly. But it increases the difficulties of the defenders of the Faith.
For though man can and must know God, Who, for His part, has revealed
Himself, our knowledge ought to consist in a simple acceptance of the
precise terms of Scripture. The utmost humility is necessary; error
begins when men grow inquisitive. Our capacity for knowledge, as Hilary
is never tired of insisting, is so limited that we ought to be content
to believe without defining the terms of our belief. For weak as
intellect is, language, the instrument which it must employ, is still
less adequate to so great a task <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md)
. Heresy has insisted upon definition, and the true belief is compelled
to follow suit <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) . Here again, in
the heretical abuse of technical terms and of logical processes, we find
a reason for the almost ostentatious simplicity of diction which we
often find in Hilary’s pages. He evidently believed that it was possible
for us to apprehend revealed truth and to profit fully by it, without
paraphrase or other explanation. In the case of one great doctrine, as
we shall see, no necessities of controversy compelled him to develope
his belief; if he had had his way, the Faith should never have been
stated in ampler terms than ‘I believe in the Holy Ghost.’

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p49"></span>In a great measure he has succeeded in
retaining this simplicity in regard to the doctrine of God. He had the
full Greek sense of the divine unity; there is no suggestion of the
possession by the Persons of the Trinity of contrasted or complementary
qualities. The revelation he would defend is that of God, One, perfect,
infinite, immutable. This absolute God has manifested Himself under the
name ‘<span class="c12"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p49.1"></span>He that
is</span>,’ to which Hilary constantly recurs. It is only through His
own revelation of Himself that God can be known. But here we are faced
by a difficulty; our reason is inadequate and tends to be fallacious.
The argument from analogy, which we should naturally use, cannot be a
sufficient guide, since it must proceed from the finite to the infinite.
Hilary has set this forth with great force and frequency, and with a
picturesque variety of illustration. Again, our partial glimpses of the
truth are often in apparent contradiction; when this is the case, we
need to be on our guard against the <span id="page_lxiv">p. lxiv</span>
<span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxiv"></span>temptation to reject one as
incompatible with the other. We must devote an equal attention to each,
and believe without hesitation that both are true. The interest of the
*De Trinitate* is greatly heightened by the skill and courage with which
Hilary will handle some seeming paradox, and make the antithesis of
opposed infinities conduce to reverence for Him of Whom they are
aspects. And he never allows his reader to forget the immensity of his
theme; and here again the skill is manifest with which he casts upon the
reader the same awe with which he is himself impressed.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p50"></span>Of God as Father Hilary has little that
is new to say. He is called Father in Scripture; therefore He is Father
and necessarily has a Son. And conversely the fact that Scripture speaks
of God the Son is proof of the fatherhood. In fact, the name ‘Son’
contains a revelation so necessary for the times that it has practically
banished that of ‘the Word,’ which we should have expected Hilary, as a
disciple of Origen, to employ by preference <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) . But since faith in the Father alone
is insufficient for salvation <span id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) ,
and is, indeed, not only insufficient but actually false, because it
denies His fatherhood in ignoring the consubstantial Son, Hilary’s
attention is concentrated upon the relation between these two Persons.
This relation is one of eternal mutual indwelling, or ‘perichoresis,’ as
it has been called, rendered possible by Their oneness of nature and by
the infinity of Both. The thought is worked out from such passages as
[Isaiah xlv. 14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.iii.ii-p52.1"></span>, St. [John xiv.
11](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#011.md)<span id="ii.iii.ii-p52.2"></span>,
with great cogency and completeness, yet always with due stress laid on
the incapacity of man to comprehend its immensity. Hilary advances from
this scriptural position to the profound conception of the divine
self-consciousness as consisting in Their mutual recognition. Each sees
Himself in His perfect image, which must be coeternal with Himself. In
Hilary this is only a hint, one of the many thoughts which the urgency
of the conflict with Arianism forbade him to expand. But Dorner justly
sees in it ‘a kind of speculative construction of the doctrine of the
Trinity, out of the idea of the divine self-consciousness <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) .’

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p54"></span>The Arian controversy was chiefly waged
over the question of the eternal generation of the Son. By the time that
Hilary began to write, every text of Scripture which could be made
applicable to the point in dispute had been used to the utmost. There
was little or nothing that remained to be done in the discovery or
combination of passages. Of that controversy Athanasius was the hero;
the arguments which he used and those which he refuted are admirably set
forth in the introduction to the translation of his writings in this
series. In writing the *De Trinitate*, so far as it dealt directly with
the original controversy, it was neither possible nor desirable that
Hilary should leave the beaten path. His object was to provide his
readers with a compendious statement of ascertained truth for their own
guidance, and with an armoury of weapons which had been tried and found
effective in the conflicts of the day. It would, therefore, be
superfluous to give in this place a detailed account of his reasonings
concerning the generation of the Son, nor would such an account be of
any assistance to those who have his writings in their hands. Hilary’s
treatment of the Scriptural evidence is very complete, as was, indeed,
necessary in a work which was intended as a handbook for practical use.
The Father alone is unbegotten; the Son is truly the Son, neither
created nor adopted. The Son is the Creator of the worlds, the Wisdom of
God, Who alone knows the Father, Who manifested God to man in the
various Theophanies of the Old Testament. His birth is without parallel,
inasmuch as other births imply a previous non-existence, while that of
the Son is from eternity. For the generation on the part of the Father
and the birth on the part of the Son are not connected as by <span
id="page_lxv">p. lxv</span> <span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxv"></span>a
temporal sequence of cause and effect, but exactly coincide in a
timeless eternity <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) . Hilary
repudiates the possibility of illustrating this divine birth by sensible
analogies; it is beyond our understanding as it is beyond time. Nor can
we wonder at this, seeing that our own birth is to us an insoluble
mystery. The eternal birth of the Son is the expression of the eternal
nature of God. It is the nature of the One that He should be Father, of
the Other that He should be Son; this nature is co-eternal with
Themselves, and therefore the One is co-eternal with the Other. Hence
Athanasius had drawn the conclusion that the Son is ‘by nature and not
by will’ <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) ; not that the will of
God is contrary to His nature, but that (if the words may be used) there
was no scope for its exercise in the generation of the Son, which came
to pass as a direct consequence of the Divine nature. Such language was
a natural protest against an Arian abuse; but it was a departure from
earlier precedent and was not accepted by that Cappadocian school, more
true to Alexandrian tradition than Athanasius himself, with which Hilary
was in closest sympathy. In their eyes the generation of the Son must be
an act of God’s will, if the freedom of Omnipotence, for which they were
jealous, was to be respected; and Hilary shared their scruples. Not only
in the *De Synodis* but in the *De Trinitate* <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) he assigns the birth of the Son to the
omnipotence, the counsel and will of God acting in co-operation with His
nature. This two-fold cause of birth is peculiar to the Son; all other
beings owe their existence simply to the power and will, not to the
nature of God <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) . Such being the
relation between Father and Son, it is obvious that They cannot differ
in nature. The word ‘birth,’ by which the relation is described,
indicates the transmission of nature from parent to offspring; and this
word is, like ‘Father’ and ‘Son,’ an essential part of the revelation.
The same divine nature or substance exists eternally and in equal
perfection in Both, un-begotten in the Father, begotten in the Son. In
fact, the expression, ‘Only-begotten God’ may be called Hilary’s
watchword, with such ‘peculiar abundance <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) ’ does it occur in his writings, as in
those of his Cappadocian friends. But, though the Son is the Image of
the Father, Hilary in his maturer thought, when free from the influence
of his Asiatic allies, is careful to avoid using the inadequate and
perilous term ‘likeness’ to describe the relation <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) . Such being the birth, and such the
unity of nature, the Son must be very God. This is proved by all the
usual passages of the Old Testament, from the Creation, onwards. These
are used, as by the other Fathers, to prove that the Son has not the
name only, but the reality, of Godhead; the reality corresponding to the
nature. All things were made through Him out of nothing; therefore He is
Almighty as the Father is Almighty. If man is made in the image of Both,
if one Spirit belongs to Both, there can be no difference of nature
between the Two. But They are not Two as possessing one nature, like
human father and son, while living separate lives. God is One, with a
Divinity undivided and indivisible <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) ; and Hilary is never weary of denying
the Arian charge that his creed involved the worship of two Gods. No
analogies from created things can explain this unity. Tree and branch,
fire and heat, source and stream can only illustrate Their inseparable
co-existence; such comparisons, if pressed, lead inevitably to error.
The true unity of Father and Son is deeper than this; deeper also than
any unity, however perfect, of will with will. For it is an eternal
mutual indwelling, Each perfectly corresponding with and comprehending
and containing the Other, and Himself in the Other; <span
id="page_lxvi">p. lxvi</span> <span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxvi"></span>and
this not after the manner of earthly commingling of substances or
exchange of properties. The only true comparison that can be made is
with the union between Christ, in virtue of His humanity, and the
believer <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) ; such is the union, in
virtue of the Godhead, between Father and Son. And this unity extends
inevitably to will and action, since the Father is acting in all that
the Son does, the Son is acting in all that the Father does; ‘he that
hath seen Me hath seen the Father.’ This doctrine reconciles all our
Lord’s statements in the Gospel of St. John concerning His own and His
Father’s work.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p63"></span>But, notwithstanding this unity, there
is a true numerical duality of Person. Sabellius, we must remember, had
held for two generations the pre-eminence among heretics. To the
Greek-speaking world outside Egypt the error which he and Paul of
Samosata had taught, that God is one Person, was still the most
dangerous of falsehoods; the supreme victory of truth had not been won
in their eyes when Arius was condemned at Nicæa, but when Paul was
deposed at Antioch. The Nicene leaders had certainly counted the cost
when they adopted as the test of orthodoxy the same word which Paul had
used for the inculcation of error. But the *homoousion*, however great
its value as a permanent safeguard of truth, was the immediate cause of
alienation and suspicion. And not only did it make the East
misunderstand the West, but it furnished the Arians with the most
effective of instruments for widening the breach between the two forces
opposed to them. They had an excuse for calling their opponents in Egypt
and the West by the name of Sabellians, the very name most likely to
engender distrust in Asia <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) .
Hilary, who could enter with sympathy into the Eastern mind and had
learnt from his own treatment at Seleucia how strong the feeling was,
labours with untiring patience to dissipate the prejudice. There is no
Arian plea against which he argues at greater length. The names ‘Father’
and ‘Son,’ being parts of the revelation, are convincing proofs of
distinction of Person as well as of unity of nature. They prove that the
nature is the same, but possessed after a different manner by Each of
the Two; by the One as ingenerate, by the Other as begotten. The word
‘Image,’ also a part of the revelation, is another proof of the
distinction; an object and its reflection in a mirror are obviously not
one thing. Again, the distinct existence of the Son is proved by the
fact that He has free volition of His own; and by a multitude of
passages of Scripture, many of them absolutely convincing, as for
instance, those from the Gospel of St John. But these two Persons,
though one in nature, are not equal in dignity. The Father is greater
than the Son; greater not merely as compared to the incarnate Christ,
but as compared to the Son, begotten from eternity. This is not simply
by the prerogative inherent in all paternity; it is because the Father
is self-existent, Himself the Source of all being <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) . With one of His happy phrases Hilary
describes it as an inferiority *generatione, non genere* <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) ; the Son is one in kind or nature
with the Father, though inferior, as the Begotten, to the Unbegotten.
But this inferiority is not to be so construed as to lessen our belief
in His divine attributes. For instance, when He addresses the Father in
prayer, this is not because He is subordinate, but because He wishes to
honour the Fatherhood <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) ; and, as
Hilary argues at great length <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) ,
the end, when God shall be all in all, is not to be regarded as a
surrender of the Son’s power, in the sense of loss. It is a mysterious
final state of permanent, willing submission to the Father’s will, into
which He enters by the supreme expression of an obedience which has
never failed. Again, our Lord’s language in St. [Mark xiii.
32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032.md)<span id="ii.iii.ii-p68.1"></span>,
must not be taken as signifying ignorance on the part of the Son of His
Father’s purpose. For, according to St. Paul ([Col. ii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003)<span id="ii.iii.ii-p68.2"></span>.md),
in Him are hid all the <span id="page_lxvii">p. lxvii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxvii"></span>treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and
therefore He must know the day and hour of judgment. He is ignorant
relatively to us, in the sense that He will not betray His Father’s
secret <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) . Whether or no it be
possible in calmer times to maintain that the knowledge and the
ignorance are complementary truths which finite minds cannot reconcile,
we cannot wonder that Hilary, ever on the watch against apparent
concessions to Arianism, should in this instance have abandoned his
usual method of balancing against each other the apparent contraries.
His reasoning is, in any case, a striking proof of his intense
conviction of the co-equal Godhead of the Son.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p70"></span>Such is Hilary’s argument, very briefly
stated. We may read almost all of it, where Hilary himself had certainly
read it, in the *Discourses against the Arians* and elsewhere in the
writings of Athanasius. How far, however, he was borrowing from the
latter must remain doubtful, as must the question as to the originality
of Athanasius. For the controversy was universal, and both of these
great writers had the practical purpose of collecting the best arguments
out of the multitude which were suggested in ephemeral literature or
verbal debate. Their victory, intellectual as well as moral, over their
adversaries was decisive, and the more striking because it was the
Arians who had made the attack on ground chosen by themselves. The
authority of Scripture as the final court of appeal was their premise as
well as that of their opponents; and they had selected the texts on
which the verdict of Scripture was to be based. Out of their own mouth
they were condemned, and the work done in the fourth century can never
need to be repeated. It was, of course, an unfinished work. As we have
seen, Hilary concerns himself with two Persons, not with three; and
since he states the contrasted truths of plurality and unity without
such explanation of the mystery as the speculative genius of Augustine
was to supply, he leaves, in spite of all his efforts, a certain
impression of excessive dualism. But these defects do not lessen the
permanent value of his work.. Indeed, we may even assert that they,
together with some strange speculations and many instances of which
interpretation, which are, however, no part of the structure of his
argument and could not affect its solidity, actually enhance its human
and historical interest. The *De Trinitate* remains ‘the most perfect
literary achievement called forth by the Arian controversy <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) .’

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p72"></span>Hitherto we have been considering the
relations within the Godhead of Father and Son, together with certain
characters which belong to the Son in virtue of His eternal birth. We
now come to the more original part of Hilary’s teaching, which must be
treated in greater detail. Till now he has spoken only of the Son; he
now comes to speak of Christ, the name which the Son bears in relation
to the world. We have seen that Hilary regards the Son as the
Creator <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) . This was proved for
him, as for Athanasius, by the passage, [Proverbs viii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)<span id="ii.iii.ii-p73.1"></span>,
which they read according to the Septuagint, ‘The Lord hath’ created Me
for the beginning of His ways for His Works <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) .’ These words, round which the
controversy raged, were interpreted by the orthodox as implying that at
the time, and for the purpose, of creation the Father assigned new
functions to the Son as His representative. The gift of these functions,
the exercise of which called into existence orders of being inferior to
God, marked in Hilary’s eyes a change so definite and important in the
activity of the Son that it deserved to be called a second birth, not
ineffable like the eternal birth, but strictly analogous to the
Incarnation. This last was a creation, which brought Him within the
sphere of created humanity; the creation of Wisdom for the beginning of
God’s ways had brought Him, though less closely, into the same
relation <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) , and <span
id="page_lxviii">p. lxviii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxviii"></span>the Incarnation is the completion of
what was begun in preparation for the creation of the world. Creation is
the mode by which finite being begins, and the beginning of each stage
in the connection between the infinite Son and His creatures is called,
from the one point of view, a creation, from the other, a birth. We
cannot fail to see here an anticipation of the opinion that ‘the true
Protevangelium is the revelation of Creation, or in other words that the
Incarnation was independent of the Fall <span
id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) ,’ for the Incarnation is a step in
the one continuous divine progress from the Creation to the final
consummation of all things, and has not sin for its cause, but is part
of the original counsel of God <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) .
Together with this new office the Son receives a new name. Henceforth
Hilary calls Him Christ; He is Christ in relation to the world, as He is
Son in relation to the Father. From the beginning of time, then, the Son
becomes Christ and stands in immediate relation to the world; it is in
and through Christ that God is the Author of all things <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) , and the title of Creator strictly
belongs to the Son. This beginning of time, we must remember, is hidden
in no remote antiquity. The world had no mysterious past; it came into
existence suddenly at a date which could be fixed with much precision,
some 5,600 years before Hilary’s day <span
id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) , and had undergone no change since
then. Before that date there had been nothing outside the Godhead; from
that time forth the Son has stood in constant relation to the created
world.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p80"></span>Christ, for so we must henceforth call
Him, has not only sustained in being the universe which He created, but
has also imparted to men a steadily increasing knowledge of God. For
such knowledge, we remember, man was made, and his salvation depends
upon its possession. All the Theophanies of the Old Testament are such
revelations by Him of Himself; and it was He that spoke by the mouth of
Moses and the Prophets. But however significant and valuable this Divine
teaching and manifestation might be, it was not complete in itself, but
was designed to prepare men’s minds to expect its fulfilment in the
Incarnation. Just as the Law was preliminary to the Gospel, so the
appearances of Christ in human form to Abraham and to others were a
foreshadowing of the true humanity which He was to assume. They were
true revelations, as far as they went; but their purpose was not simply
to impart so much knowledge as they explicitly conveyed, but also to
lead men on to expect more, and to expect it in the very form in which
it ultimately came <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) . For His
self-revelation in the Incarnation was but the treading again of a
familiar path. He had often appeared, and had often spoken, by His own
mouth or by that of men whom He had inspired; and in all this contact
with the world His one object had been to bestow upon mankind the
knowledge of God. With the same object He became incarnate; the full
revelation was to impart the perfect knowledge. He became man, Hilary
says, in order that we might believe Him;—‘to be a Witness from among us
to the things of God, and by means of weak flesh to proclaim God the
Father to our weak and carnal selves <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) .’ Here again we see the continuity of
the Divine purpose, the fulfilment of the counsel which dates back to
the beginning of time. If man had not sinned, he would still have needed
the progressive revelation; sin has certainly modified Christ’s course
upon earth, but was not the determining cause of the Incarnation.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p83"></span>The doctrine of the Incarnation, or
Embodiment as Hilary prefers to call it, is presented very fully in the
*De Trinitate*, and with much originality. The Godhead of Christ is
secured by His identity with the eternal Son and by the fact that at the
very time of His humilia<span id="page_lxix">p. lxix</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxix"></span>tion upon earth He was continuing
without interruption His divine work of maintaining the existence of the
worlds <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) . Indeed, by a natural
protest against the degradation which the Arians would put upon Him, it
is the glory of Christ upon which Hilary lays chief stress. And this is
not the moral glory of submission and self-sacrifice, but the visible
glory of miracles attesting the Divine presence. In the third book of
the *De Trinitate* the miracles of Cana and of the feeding of the five
thousand, the entrance into the closed room where the disciples were
assembled, the darkness and the earthquake at the Crucifixion, are the
proofs urged for His Godhead; and the wonderful circumstances
surrounding the birth at Bethlehem are similarly employed in book
ii. <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) Sound as the reasoning is,
it is typical of a certain unwillingness on Hilary’s part to dwell upon
the self-surrender of Christ; he prefers to think of Him rather as the
Revealer of God than as the Redeemer of men. But, apart from this
preference, he constantly insists that the Incarnation has caused
neither loss nor change of the Divine nature in Christ <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) , and proves the point by the same
words of our Lord which had been used to demonstrate the eternal
Sonship. And the assumption of flesh lessens His power as little as it
degrades His nature. For though it is, in one aspect, an act of
submission to the will of the Father, it is, in another, an exertion of
His own omnipotence. No inferior power could appropriate to itself an
alien nature; only God could strip Himself of the attributes of
Godhead <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p88"></span>But the incarnate Christ is as truly man
as He is truly God. We have seen that He is ‘created in the body’; and
Hilary constantly insists that His humanity is neither fictitious nor
different in kind from ours <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) . We
must therefore consider what is the constitution of man. He is, so
Hilary teaches, a physically composite being; the elements of which his
body is composed are themselves lifeless, and man himself is never fully
alive <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) . According to this
physiology, the father is the author of the child’s body, the maternal
function being altogether subsidiary. It would seem that the mother does
nothing more than protect the embryo, so giving it the opportunity of
growth, and finally bring the child to birth <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) . And each human soul is separately
created, like the universe, out of nothing. Only the body is engendered;
the soul, wherein the likeness of man to God consists, has a nobler
origin, being the immediate creation of God <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) . Hilary does not hold, or at least
does not attach importance to, the tripartite division of man; for the
purposes of his philosophy we consist of soul and body. We may now
proceed to consider his theory of the Incarnation. This is based upon
the Pauline conception of the first and second Adam. Each of these was
created, and the two acts of creation exactly correspond. Christ, the
Creator, made clay into the first Adam, who therefore had an earthly
body. He made Himself into the second Adam, and therefore has a heavenly
Body. To this end He descended from heaven and entered into the Virgin’s
womb. For, in accordance with Hilary’s principle of interpretation <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) , the word ‘Spirit’ must not be
regarded as necessarily signifying the Holy Ghost, but one or other of
the Persons of the Trinity as the context may require; and in this case
it means the Son, since the question is of an act of creation, and He,
and none other, is the Creator. Also, correspondence between the two
Adams would be as effectually broken were the Holy Ghost the Agent in
the conception, as it would be were Christ’s body engendered and not
created. Thus <span id="page_lxx">p. lxx</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxx"></span>He is Himself not only the Author but (if
the word may be used) the material of His own body <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) ; the language of St. John, that the
Word *became* flesh, must be taken literally. It would be insufficient
to say that the Word took, or united Himself to, the flesh <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) . But this creation of the Second Adam
to be true man is not our only evidence of His humanity. We have seen
that in Hilary’s judgment the mother has but a secondary share in her
offspring. That share, whatever it be, belongs to the Virgin; she
contributed to His growth and to His coming to birth ‘everything which
it is the nature of her sex to impart <span
id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) .’ But though Christ is constantly
said to have been born of the Virgin, He is habitually called the ‘Son
of Man,’ not the Son of the Virgin, nor she the Mother of God. Such
language would attribute to her an activity and an importance
inconsistent with Hilary’s theory. For no portion of her substance, he
distinctly says, was taken into the substance of her Son’s human
body <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) ; and elsewhere he argues
that St. Paul’s words ‘made of a woman’ are deliberately chosen to
describe Christ’s birth as a creation free from any commingling with
existing humanity <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) . But the
Virgin has an essential share in the fulfilment of prophecy. For though
Christ without her co-operation could have created Himself as Man, yet
He would not have been, as He was fore-ordained to be, the Son of
Man <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) . And since He holds that
the Virgin performs every function of a mother, Hilary avoids that
Valentinian heresy according to which Christ passed through the Virgin
‘like water through a pipe <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) ,’
for He was Himself the Author of a true act of creation within her, and,
when she had fulfilled her office, was born as true flesh. Again,
Hilary’s clear sense of the eternal personal pre-existence of the Word
saves him from any contact with the Monarchianism combated by Hippolytus
and Tertullian, which held that the Son was the Father under another
aspect. Indeed, so secure does he feel himself that he can venture to
employ Monarchian theories, now rendered harmless, in explanation of the
mysteries of the Incarnation. For we cannot fail to see a connection
between his opinions and theirs; and it might seem that, confident in
his wider knowledge, he has borrowed not only from the arguments used by
Tertullian against the Monarchian Praxeas, but also from those which
Tertullian assigns to the latter. Such reasonings, we know, had been
very prevalent in the West; and Hilary’s use of certain of them, in
order to turn their edge by showing that they were not inconsistent with
the fundamental doctrines of the Faith <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) , may indicate that Monarchianism was
still a real danger.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p102"></span>Thus the Son becomes flesh, and that by
true maternity on the Virgin’s part. But man is more than flesh; he is
soul as well, and it is the soul which makes him man instead of matter.
The soul, as we saw, is created by a special act of God at the beginning
of the separate existence of each human being; and Christ, to be true
man and not merely true flesh, created for Himself the human soul which
was necessary for true humanity. He had borrowed from the Apollinarians,
consciously no doubt, their interpretation of one of their favourite
passages, ‘The Word became flesh’; here again we find an argument of
heretics rendered harmless and adopted by orthodoxy. For the strange
Apollinarian <span id="page_lxxi">p. lxxi</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxi"></span>denial to Christ of a human soul, and
therefore of perfect manhood, is not only expressly contradicted <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) , but repudiated on every page by the
contrary assumption on which all Hilary’s arguments are based. Christ,
then, is ‘perfect man <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) , of a
reasonable soul and Human flesh subsisting,’ for Whom the Virgin has
performed the normal functions of maternity. But there is one wide and
obvious difference between Hilary’s mode of handling the matter and that
with which we are familiar. His view concerning the mother’s office
forbids his laying stress upon our Lord’s inheritance from her.
Occasionally, and without emphasis, he mentions our Lord as the Son of
David, or otherwise introduces His human ancestry <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) , but he never dwells upon the
subject. He neither bases upon this ancestry the truth, nor deduces from
it the character, of Christ’s humanity. Such is Hilary’s account of the
facts of the Incarnation. In his teaching there is no doubt error as
well as defect, but only in the mode of explanation, not in the doctrine
explained. It will help us to do him justice if we may compare the
theories that have been framed concerning another great doctrine, that
of the Atonement, and remember that the strangely diverse speculations
of Gregory the Great and of St. Anselm profess to account for the same
facts, and that, so far as definitions of the Church are concerned, we
are free to accept one or other, or neither, of the rival explanations.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p106"></span>Christ, then, Who had been perfect God
from eternity, became perfect Man by His self-wrought act of creation.
Thus there was an approximation between God and man; man was raised by
God, Who humbled Himself to meet Him. On the one hand the Virgin was
sanctified in preparation for her sacred motherhood <span
id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) ; on the other hand there was a
condescension of the Son to our low estate. The key to this is found by
Hilary in the language of St. Paul. Christ emptied Himself of the form
of God and took the form of a servant; this is a revelation as decisive
as the same Apostle’s words concerning the first and the second Adam.
The form of God, wherein the Son is to the Father as the exact image
reflected in a mirror, the exact impression taken from a seal, belongs
to Christ’s very being. He could not detach it from Himself, if He
would, for it is the property of God to be eternally what He is; and, as
Hilary constantly reminds us, the continuous existence of creation is
evidence that there had been no break in the Son’s divine activity in
maintaining the universe which He had made. While He was in the cradle
He upheld the worlds <span id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) . Yet, in
some real sense, Christ emptied Himself of this form of God <span
id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) . It was necessary that He should do
so if manhood, even the sinless manhood created by Himself for His own
Incarnation, was to co-exist with Godhead in His one Person <span
id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) . This is stated as distinctly as is
the correlative fact that He retained and exercised the powers and the
majesty of His nature. Thus it is clear that, outside the sphere of His
work for men, the form and the nature of God remained unchanged in the
Son; while within that sphere the form, though not the nature, was so
affected that it could truly be said to be laid aside. But when we come
to Hilary’s explanation of this process, we can only acquit him of
inconsistency in thought by admitting the ambiguity of his language. In
one group of passages he recognises the self-emptying, but minimises its
importance; in another he denies that our Lord could or did empty
Himself of the form of God. And again, his definitions of the word
‘form’ are so various as to be actually contradictory. Yet a consistent
<span id="page_lxxii">p. lxxii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxii"></span>sense, and one exceedingly
characteristic of Hilary, can be derived from a comparison of his
statements <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) ; and in judging him
we must remember that we have no systematic exposition of his views, but
must gather them not only from his deliberate reasonings, but sometimes
from homiletical amplifications of Scripture language, composed for
edification and without the thought of theological balance, and
sometimes from incidental sayings, thrown out in the course of other
lines of argument. To the minimising statements belongs his description
of the evacuation as a ‘change of apparel <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) ,’ and his definition of the word
‘form’ as meaning no more than ‘face’ or ‘appearance <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) ,’as also his insistence from time to
time upon the permanence of this form in Christ, not merely in His
supramundane relations, but as the Son of Man <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) . On the other hand Hilary expressly
declares that the ‘concurrence of the two forms <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) ’ is impossible, they being mutually
exclusive. This represents the higher form, that of God, as something
more than a dress or appearance which could be changed or masked; and
stronger still is the language used in the Homily on [Psalm
xviii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#000.md)<span
id="ii.iii.ii-p115.1"></span> There (§ 4) he speaks of Christ being
exhausted of His heavenly nature, this being used as a synonym for the
form of God, and even of His being emptied of His substance. But it is
probable that the Homily has descended to us, without revision by its
author, in the very words which the shorthand writer took down. This
mention of ‘substance’ is unlike Hilary’s usual language, and the
antithesis between the substance which the Son had not, because He had
emptied Himself of it, and the substance which He had, because He had
assumed it, is somewhat infelicitously expressed. The term must
certainly not be taken as the deliberate statement of Hilary’s final
opinion, still less as the decisive passage to which his other
assertions must be accommodated; but it is at least clear evidence that
Hilary, in the maturity of his thought, was not afraid to state in the
strongest possible language the reality and completeness of the
evacuation. The reconciliation of these apparently contradictory views
concerning Christ’s relation to the form of God can only be found in
Hilary’s idea of the Incarnation as a ‘dispensation,’ or series of
dispensations. The word and the thought are borrowed through
Tertullian <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) from the Greek
‘economy’; but in Hilary’s mind the notion of Divine reserve has grown
till it has become, we might almost say, the dominant element of the
conception. This self-emptying is a dispensation <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) , whereby the incarnate Son of God
appears to be, what He is not, destitute of the form of God. For this
form is the glory of God, concealed by our Lord for the purposes of His
human life, yet held by Hilary, to a greater extent, perhaps, than by
any other theologian, to have been present with Him on earth. In words
which have a wider application, and must be considered hereafter, Hilary
speaks of Christ as ‘emptying Himself and hiding Himself within
Himself <span id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) .’ Concealment has a
great part to play in Hilary’s theories, and is in this instance the
only explanation consistent with his doctrinal position <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p120"></span>Thus the Son made possible the union of
humanity with Himself. He ‘shrank from God into man <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) ’ by an act not only of Divine power,
but of personal Divine will. He Who did this thing could not cease to be
what He had been before; hence His very deed in submitting Himself to
the change is evidence of His unchanged continuity of existence <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) . <span id="page_lxxiii">p.
lxxiii</span> <span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxiii"></span>And furthermore,
His assumption of the servant’s form was not accomplished by a single
act. His wearing of that form was one continuous act of voluntary
self-repression <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) , and the events
of His life on earth bear frequent witness to His possession of the
powers of God.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p124"></span>Thus in Him God is united with man;
these two natures form the ‘elements’ or ‘parts’ of one Person <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) . The Godhead is superposed upon the
manhood; or, as Hilary prefers to say, the manhood is assumed by
Christ <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) . And these two natures
are not confused <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) , but
simultaneously coexist in Him as the Son of Man <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) . There are not two Christs <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) , nor is the one Christ a composite
Being in such a sense that He is intermediate in kind between God and
Man. He can speak as God and can also speak as Man; in the *Homilies on
the Psalms* Hilary constantly distinguishes between His utterances in
the one and the other nature. Yet He is one Person with two natures, of
which the one dominates, though it does not extinguish, the other in
every relation of His existence as the Son of Man <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) . Every act, bodily or mental, done by
Him is done by both natures of the one Christ. Hence a certain
indifference towards the human aspects of His life, and a tendency
rather to explain away what seems humiliation than to draw out its
lessons <span id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) . And Hilary is so
impressed with the unity of Christ that the humanity, a notion for which
he has no name <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) , would have been
in his eyes nothing more than a collective term for certain attributes
of One Who is more than man, just as the body of Christ is not for him a
dwelling occupied, or an instrument used, by God, but an inseparable
property of Christ, Who personally is God and Man.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p133"></span>Hence the body of Christ has a
character peculiar to itself. It is a heavenly body <span
id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) , because of its origin and because of
its Owner, the Son of Man Who came down from heaven, and though on earth
was in heaven still <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) . It
performs the functions and experiences, the limitations of a human body,
and this is evidence that it is in every sense a true, not an alien or
fictitious body. Though it is free from the sins of humanity, it has our
weaknesses. But here the distinction must be made, which will presently
be discussed, between the two kinds of suffering, that which feels and
that which only endures. Christ was not conscious of suffering from
these weaknesses, which could inflict no sense of want of weariness or
pain upon His body, a body not the less real because it was perfect. He
took our infirmities as truly as He bore our sins. But He was no more
under the dominion of the one than of the other <span
id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) . His body was in the likeness of
ours, but its reality did not consist in the likeness <span
id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) , but in the fact that He had created
it a true body. Christ, by virtue of His creative power, might have made
for Himself a true body, by means of which to fulfil God’s purposes,
that should have been free from these infirmities. It was for our sake
that He did not. There would have been a true body, but it would have
been difficult for us to believe it. Hence He assumed one which had for
habits <span id="page_lxxiv">p. lxxiv</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxiv"></span>what are necessities to us, in order to
demonstrate to us its reality <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) .
It was foreordained that He should be incarnate; the mode of the
Incarnation was determined by considerations of our advantage. The
arguments by which this thesis is supported will be stated presently, in
connection with Hilary’s account of the Passion. It would be difficult
to decide whether he has constructed his theory concerning the human
activities of our Lord upon the basis of this preponderance of the
Divine nature in His incarnate personality, or whether he has argued
back from what he deems the true account of Christ’s mode of life on
earth, and invented the hypothesis in explanation of it. In any case he
has had the courage exactly to reverse the general belief of Christendom
regarding the powers normally used by Christ. We are accustomed to think
that with rare exceptions, such as the Transfiguration, He lived a life
limited by the ordinary conditions of humanity, to draw lessons for
ourselves from His bearing in circumstances like our own, to estimate
His condescension and suffering, in kind if not in degree, by our own
consciousness. Hilary regards the normal state of the incarnate Christ
as that of exaltation, from which He stooped on rare occasions, by a
special act of will, to self-humiliation. Thus the Incarnation, though
itself a declension from the pristine glory, does not account for the
facts of Christ’s life; they must be explained by further isolated and
temporary declensions. And since the Incarnation is the one great event,
knowledge and faith concerning which are essential, the events which
accompany or result from it tend, in Hilary’s thought, to shrink in
importance. They can and must be minimised, explained away, regarded as
‘dispensations,’ if they seem to derogate from the Majesty of Him Who
was incarnate.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p139"></span>When we examine the interpretation of
Scripture by which Hilary reaches the desired conclusions we find it, in
many instances, strange indeed. The letter of the Gospels tells us of
bodily needs and of suffering; Christ, though more than man, is proved
to be Man by His obvious submission to the conditions of human life. But
according to Hilary all human suffering is due to the union of an
imperfect soul with an imperfect body. The soul of Christ, though truly
human, was perfect; His body was that of a Person Divine as well as
human. Thus both elements were perfect of their kind, and therefore as
free from infirmity <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) as from sin,
for affliction is the lot of man not because he is man, but because he
is a sinner. In contrast with the squalor of sinful humanity, glory
surrounded Christ from the Annunciation onward throughout His course on
earth <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) . Miracle is the
attestation of His Godhead, and He who was thus superior to the powers
of nature could not be subject to the sufferings which nature inflicts.
But, being omnipotent, He could subject Himself to humiliations which no
power less than His own could lay upon Him, and this self-subjection is
the supreme evidence of His might as well of His goodwill towards men.
God, and only God, could occupy at once the cradle and the throne on
high <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) . Thus in emphasizing the
humiliation Hilary is extolling the majesty of Christ, and refuting the
errors of Arianism. That school had made the most of Christ’s
sufferings, holding them as proof of His inferiority to the Father. In
Hilary’s eyes His power to condescend and His final victory are equally
conclusive evidences of His co-equal Divinity. But if He stoops to our
estate, and is at the same time God exercising His full prerogatives,
here again there must be a ‘dispensation.’ He was truly subject to the
limitations of our nature; that is a fact of revelation. But He was
subject by a succession of detached acts of self-restraint, culminating
in the act, voluntary like the others, of His death <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) . Of His acceptance of the ordinary
infirmities of humanity we have already spoken. Hilary gives the same
explanation of the Passion as he does of the thirst or <span
id="page_lxxv">p. lxxv</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxv"></span>weariness of Christ. That He could
suffer, and that to the utmost, is proved by the fact that He did
suffer; yet was He, or could He be, conscious of suffering? For the
fulfilment of the Divine purpose, for our assurance of the reality of
His work, the acts had to be done; but it was sufficient that they
should be done by a dispensation, in other words, that the events should
be real and yet the feelings be absent of which, had the events happened
to us, we should have been conscious. To understand this we must recur
to Hilary’s theory of the relation of the soul to the body. The former
is the organ of sense, the latter a lifeless thing. But the soul may
fall below, or rise above, its normal state. Mortification of the body
may set in, or drugs be administered which shall render the soul
incapable of feeling the keenest pain <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) . On the other hand it is capable of a
spiritual elevation which shall make it unconscious of bodily needs or
sufferings, as when Moses and Elijah fasted, or the three Jewish youths
walked amid the flames <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) . On this
high level Christ always dwelt. Others might rise for a moment above
themselves; He, not although, but because He was true and perfect Man,
never fell below it. He placed Himself in circumstances where shame and
wounds and death were inflicted upon Him; He had lived a life of
humiliation, not only real, in that it involved a certain separation
from God, but also apparent. But as in this latter respect we may no
more overlook His glory than we may suppose Him ignorant, as by a
dispensation He professed to be <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md)
, so in regard to the Passion we must not imagine that He was inferior
to His saints in being conscious, as they were not, of suffering <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) . So far, indeed, is He from the sense
of suffering that Hilary even says that the Passion was a delight to
Him <span id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) , and this not merely in its
prospective results, but in the consciousness of power which He enjoyed
in passing through it. Nor could this be surprising to one who looked
with Hilary’s eyes upon the humanity of Christ. He enforces his view
sometimes with rhetoric, as when he repudiates the notion that the Bread
of Life could hunger, and He who gives the living water, thirst <span
id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md) , that the hand which restored the
servant’s ear could itself feel pain <span
id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) , that He Who said, ‘Now is the Son of
Man glorified,’ when Judas left the chamber, could at that moment be
feeling sorrow <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) , and He before
Whom the soldiers fell be capable of fear <span
id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) , or shrink from the pain of a death
which was itself an exertion of His own free will and power <span
id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md) . Or else he dwells upon the general
character of Christ’s manhood. He recognises no change in the mode of
being after the Resurrection; the passing through closed doors, the
sudden disappearance at Emmaus are typical of the normal properties of
His body, which could heal the sick by a touch, and could walk upon the
waves <span id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) . It is a body upon the
sensibility of which the forces of nature can make no impression
whatever; they can no more pain Him than the stroke of a weapon can
affect air or water <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) ; or, as
Hilary puts it elsewhere, fear and death, which have so painful a
meaning to us, were no more to Him than a shower falling upon a surface
which it cannot penetrate <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) . It
is not the passages of the Gospel which tell of Christ’s glory, but
those which speak of weakness or suffering that need to be explained;
and Hilary on occasion is not afraid to explain them away. For instance,
we read that when our Lord had fasted forty days and forty nights ‘He
was afterward an hungred.’ Hilary denies that there is a connection of
cause and effect. Christ’s perfect body was unaffected <span
id="page_lxxvi">p. lxxvi</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxvi"></span>by abstinence; but after the fast by an
exertion of His will He experienced hunger <span
id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) . So also the Agony in the Garden is
ingeniously misinterpreted. He took with Him the three Apostles, and
then began to be sorrowful. He was not sorrowful till He had taken them;
they, not He, were the cause. When He said, ‘My soul is exceeding
sorrowful, even unto death,’ the last words must not be regarded as
meaning that His was a mortal sorrow, but as giving a note of time. The
sorrow of which He spoke was not for Himself but for His Apostles, whose
flight He foresaw, and He was asserting that this sorrow would last till
He died. And when He prayed that the cup might pass away from Him, this
was no entreaty that He might be spared. It was His purpose to drink it.
The prayer was for His disciples that the cup might pass on from Him to
them; that they might suffer for Him as martyrs full of hope, without
pain or fear <span id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) . One passage, St.
[Luke 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043.md),
[44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044.md)<span
id="ii.iii.ii-p158.1"></span>, which conflicts with his view is rejected
by Hilary on textual grounds, and not without some reason <span
id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) . He had looked for it, and found it
absent, in a large number of manuscripts, both Greek and Latin. But
perhaps the strangest argument which he employs is that when the Gospel
tells us that Christ thirsted and hungered and wept, it does not proceed
to say that He ate and drank and felt grief <span
id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) . Hunger and thirst, eating and
drinking, were two sets of dispensations, unconnected by the relation of
cause and effect; the tears were another dispensation, not the
expression of personal grief. If, as a habit, He accepts the needs and
functions of our body, this does not render His own body more real, for
by the act of its creation it was made truly human; His purpose, as has
been said, is to enable us to recognise its reality, which would
otherwise be difficult <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) . If He
wept, He had the same object; this use of one of the evidences of bodily
emotion would help us to believe <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md)
. And so it is throughout Christ’s life on earth. He suffered but He did
not feel. No one but a heretic, says Hilary, would suppose that He was
pained by the nails which fixed Him to the Cross <span
id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p164"></span>It is obvious that Hilary’s theory
offers a perfect defence against the two dangers of the day, Arianism
and Apollinarianism. The tables are turned upon the former by emphatic
insistence upon the power manifested in the humiliation and suffering of
Christ. That He, being what He was, should be able to place Himself in
such circumstances was the most impressive evidence of His Divinity. And
if His humanity was endowed with Divine properties, much more must His
Divinity rise above that inferiority to which the Arians consigned it.
Apollinarianism is controverted by the demonstration of His true
humanity. No language can be too strong to describe its glories; but the
true wonder is not that Christ, as God, has such attributes, but that He
Who has them is very Man. The theory was well adapted for service in the
controversies of the day; for us, however we may admire the courage and
ingenuity it displays, it can be no more than a curiosity of doctrinal
history. Yet, whatever its defects as an explanation of the facts, the
skill with which dangers on either hand are avoided, the manifest
anxiety to be loyal to established doctrine, deserve recognition and
respect. It has been said that Hilary ‘constantly withdraws in the
second clause what he has asserted in the first <span
id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) ,’ and in a sense it is true. For many
of his statements might make him seem the advocate of an extreme
doctrine of *Kenosis*, which would represent our Lord’s self-emptying as
<span id="page_lxxvii">p. lxxvii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxvii"></span>complete. But often expressed and
always present in Hilary’s thought, for the coherence of which it is
necessary, is the correlative notion of the dispensation, whereby Christ
seemed for our sake to be less than He truly was. Again, Hilary has been
accused of ‘sailing somewhat close to the cliffs of Docetism <span
id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md) ,’ but all admit that he has escaped
shipwreck. Various accounts of his teaching, all of which agree in
acquitting him of this error, have been given; and that which has been
accepted in this paper, of Christ by the very perfection of His humanity
habitually living in such an ecstasy as that of Polycarp or Perpetua at
their martyrdom, is a noble conception in itself and consistent with the
Creeds, though it cannot satisfy us. In part, at any rate, it belonged
to the lessons which Hilary had learned from Alexandria. Clement had
taught, though his successor Origen rejected, the impassability of
Christ, Who had eaten and drunk only by a ‘dispensation’;—‘He ate not
for the sake of His body, which was sustained by a holy power, but that
that false notion might not creep into the minds of His companions which
in later days some have, in fact, conceived, that He had been manifested
only in appearance. He was altogether impassible; there entered from
without into Him no movement of the feelings, whether pleasure , or
pain <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) .’ Thus Hilary had what
would be in his eyes high authority for his opinion. But he must have
felt some doubts of its value if he compared the strange exegesis and
forced logic by which it was supported with that frank acceptance of the
obvious sense of Scripture in which he takes so reasonable a pride in
His direct controversy with the Arians. And another criticism may be
ventured. In that controversy he balances with scrupulous reverence
mystery against mystery, never forgetting that he is dealing with
infinities. In this case the one is made to overwhelm the other; the
infinite glory excludes the infinite sorrow from his view. Here, if
anywhere, Hilary needs, and may justly claim, the indulgence he has
demanded. It had not been his wish to define or explain; he was content
with the plain words of Scripture and the simplest of creeds. But he was
compelled by the fault of others to commit a fault <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) ; and speculation based on sound
principles, however perilous to him who made the first attempt, had been
rendered by the prevalence of heresy a necessary evil. Again, we must
bear in mind that Hilary was essentially a Greek theologian, to whom the
supremely interesting as well as the supremely important doctrine was
that God became Man. He does not conceal or undervalue the fact of the
Atonement and of the Passion as the means by which it was wrought. But,
even though he had not held his peculiar theory of impassibility, he
would still have thought the effort most worth making not that of
realising the pains of Christ by our experience of suffering and sense
of the enormity of sin, but that of apprehending the mystery of the
Incarnation. For that act of condescension was greater, not only in
scale but in kind, than any humiliation to which Christ, already Man,
submitted Himself in His human state.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p169"></span>Christ, Whose properties as incarnate
are thus described by Hilary, is one Person. This, of course, needs no
proof, but something must be said of the use which he makes of the
doctrine. It is by Christ’s own work, by an act of power, even of
violence <span id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) , exercised by Him upon
Himself, that the two natures are inseparably associated in Him; so
inseparably that between His death and resurrection His Divinity was
simultaneously present with each of the severed elements of His
humanity <span id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) . Hence, though Hilary
frequently <span id="page_lxxviii">p. lxxviii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxviii"></span>discriminates between Christ’s
utterances as God and as Man <span id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) ,
he never fails to keep his reader’s attention fixed upon the unity of
His Person. And this unity is the more obvious because, as has been
said, the Manhood in Christ is dominated by the Godhead. Though we are
not allowed to forget that He is truly Man, yet as a rule Hilary prefers
to speak in such words as, ‘the only-begotten Son of God was
crucified <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) ,’ or to say more
briefly, ‘God was crucified <span id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) .’
Judas is ‘the betrayer of God <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) ;’
‘the life of mortals is renewed through the death of immortal God <span
id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) .’ Such expressions are far more
frequent than the balanced language, ‘the Passion of Jesus Christ, our
God and Lord <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) ,’ and these again
than such an exaltation of the manhood as ‘the Man Jesus Christ, the
Lord of Majesty <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) .’ But once, in
an unguarded moment, an element of His humanity seems to be deified.
Hilary never says that Christ’s body is God, but he speaks of the
spectators of the Crucifixion ‘contemplating the power of the soul which
by signs and deeds had proved itself God <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) .’

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p180"></span>But though distinctions may be drawn,
and though for the sake of emphasis and brevity Christ may be called by
the name of one only of His two natures, the essential fact is never
forgotten that He is God and man, one Person in two forms, God’s and the
servant’s. And these two natures do not stand isolated and apart, merely
contained within the limits of one personality. Just as we saw that
Hilary recognises a complete mutual indwelling and interpenetration of
Father and Son, so he teaches that in the narrower sphere of the
Incarnation there is an equally exact and comprehensive union of the
Godhead and Manhood in Christ. Jesus is Christ, and Christ is
Jesus <span id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) . Not merely is the one
Christ perfect Man and perfect God, but the whole Son of Man is the
whole Son of God <span id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) . So far is His
manhood from being merged and lost in His Divinity, that the extent of
the one is the measure of the other. We must not imagine that,
simultaneously with the incarnate, there existed a non-incarnate Christ,
respectively submitting to humiliation and ruling the worlds; nor yet
must we conceive of one Christ in two unconnected states of being, as
though the assumption of humanity were merely a function analogous to
the guiding of the stars. On the contrary, the one Person is
co-extensive with all infinity, and all action lies within His scope.
Whatever He does, whether it be, or be not, in relation to humanity, and
in the former case whether it be the exaltation of man-hood or the
self-emptying of Godhead, is done ‘within the sphere of the
Incarnation <span id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300.md) ,’ the sphere which
embraces His whole being and His whole action. The self-emptying itself
was not a self-determination, instant and complete, made before the
Incarnation, but, as we saw, a process which continued throughout
Christ’s life on earth and was active to the end. For as He hung,
deliberately self-emptied of His glory, on the Cross, He manifested His
normal powers by the earthquake shock. His submission to death was the
last of a consistent series of exertions of His will, which began with
the Annunciation and culminated in the Crucifixion.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p184"></span><span id="page_lxxix">p. lxxix</span>
<span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxix"></span>Hilary estimates the cost of the
Incarnation not by any episodes of Christ’s life on earth, but by the
fact that it brought about a real, though partial, separation or
breach <span id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) within the Godhead.
Henceforward there was in Christ the nature of the creature as well as
that of the Creator; and this second nature, though it had been assumed
in its most perfect form, was sundered by an infinite distance from God
the Father, though indissolubly united with the Divinity of his Son. A
barrier therefore was raised between them, to be overcome in due time by
the elevation of manhood in and through the Son. When this elevation was
complete within the Person of Christ, then the separation between Him
and His Father would be at an end. He would still have true humanity,
but this humanity would be raised to the level of association with the
Father. In Hilary’s doctrine the submission of Christ to this isolation
is the central fact of Christianity, the supreme evidence of His love
for men. Not only did it thus isolate Him, truly though partially, from
the Father, but it introduced a strain, a ‘division’ <span
id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md) within His now incarnate Person. The
union of natures was real, but in order that it might become perfect the
two needed to be adjusted; and the humiliation involved in this
adjustment is a great part of the sacrifice made by Christ. There was
conflict, in a certain sense, within Himself, repression and concealment
of His powers. But finally the barrier was to be removed, the loss
regained, by the exaltation of the manhood into harmonious association
with the Godhead of Father and of Son <span
id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) . Then He Who had become in one Person
God and Man would become for ever fully God and fully Man. The humanity
would gain, the Divinity regain, its appropriate dignity <span
id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md) , while each retained the reality it
had had on earth.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p189"></span>Thus Christ’s life in the world was a
period of transition. He had descended; this was the time of preparation
for an equal, and even loftier, ascent. We must now consider in what the
preparation consisted; and here, at first sight, Hilary has involved
himself in a grave difficulty. For it is manifest that his theory of
Christ’s life as one lived without effort, spiritual or physical, or
rather as a life whose exertion consisted in a steady self accommodation
to the infirmities of men, varied by occasional and special acts of
condescension to suffering, excludes the possibility of an advance, a
growth in grace as well as in stature, such as Athanasius scripturally
taught <span id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md) . We might say of Hilary,
as has been said of another Father, ‘under his treatment the Divine
history seems to be dissolved into a docetic drama <span
id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) .’ In such a life it might seem that
there was not merely no possibility of progress, but even an absence of
identity, in the sense of continuity. The phenomena of Christ’s life,
therefore, are not manifestations of the disturbance and strain on which
Hilary insists, for they are, when, rightly considered, proofs of His
union with God and of His Divine power, not of weakness or of partial
separation. It would, indeed, be vain for us to seek for sensible
evidence of the process of adjustment, for it went on within the inmost
being of the one Person. It did not affect the Godhead or the Manhood,
both visibly revealed as aspects of the Person, but the hidden relation
between the two. Our knowledge assures us that the process took place,
but it is a knowledge attained by inference from what He was before and
after the state of transition, not by observation of His action in that
state. Both natures of the one Person were affected; ‘everything’—glory
as well as humiliation—‘was common to the entire Person at every moment,
though to each aspect in its own distinctive manner.’ The entire Person
entered into inequality with Himself; the actuality of each aspect,
during the state of humiliation, fell short of its idea—of the idea of
the Son, of the idea of the perfect man, of the idea of the God-man. It
was <span id="page_lxxx">p. lxxx</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxx"></span>not merely the human aspect that was at
first inadequate to the Divine; for, through the medium of the voluntary
‘evacuatio,’ it dragged down the Divine nature also, so far as is
permitted it, to its own inequality <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) .’ Such is the only explanation which
will reconcile Hilary’s various, and sometimes obscure, utterances on
this great subject. It is open to the obvious and fatal objection that
it cuts, instead of loosening, the knot. For it denies any connection
between the dispensation of Christ’s life on earth and the mystery of
His assumption and exaltation of humanity; the one becomes somewhat
purposeless, and the other remains unverified. But it is at least a bold
and reverent speculation, not inconsistent with the Faith as a system of
thought, though no place can be found for it in the Faith, regarded as a
revelation of fact.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p193"></span>It was on behalf of mankind that this
great sacrifice was made by the Son. While it separated Him from the
Father, it united Him to men. We must now consider what was the
spiritual constitution of the humanity which He assumed, as we have
already considered the physical Man, as we saw (p. lxix.) is constituted
of body and soul, an outward and an inward substance, the one earthly,
the other heavenly <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) . The exact
process of his creation has been revealed. First, man—that is, his
soul—was made in the image of God; next, long afterwards, his body was
fashioned out of dust; finally by a distinct act, man was made a living
soul by the breath of God, the heavenly and earthly natures being thus
coupled together <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) . The world was
already complete when God created the highest, the most beautiful of His
works after His own image. His other works were made by an instantaneous
command; even the firmament was established by his hand <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) ; man alone was made by the hands of
God;—‘Thy hands have made me and fashioned me.’ This singular honour of
being made by a process, not an act, and by the hands, not the hand or
the voice, of God, was paid to man not simply as the highest of the
creatures, but as the one for whose sake the rest of the universe was
called into being <span id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) . It is, of
course, the soul, made after the image of God, which has this high
honour; an honour which no length of sinful ancestry can forfeit, for
each soul is still separately created. Hence no human soul is akin to
any other human soul; the uniformity of type is secured by each being
made in the same pattern, and the dignity of humanity by the fact that
this pattern is that of the Son, the Image of God. But the soul pervades
the whole body with which it is associated, even as God pervades the
universe <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) . The soul of each man
is individual, special to himself; his brotherhood with mankind belongs
to him through his body, which has therefore something of universality.
Hence the relation of mankind with Christ is not through his human soul;
it was ‘the nature of universal flesh’ which He took <span
id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md) that has made Him one with us in the
Incarnation and in the Eucharist <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md)
. The reality of His body, as we have seen, is amply secured by Hilary;
its universality is assured by the absence of any individual human
paternity, which would have isolated Him from others <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) . Thus He took all humanity into His
one body; He is the Church <span id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md) , for
He contains her through the mystery of His body. In Him, by the same
means, ‘there is contained the congregation, so to speak, of the whole
race of men.’ Hence He spoke of Himself as the City set on a hill; the
inhabitants are mankind <span id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) . But
Christ not only <span id="page_lxxxi">p. lxxxi</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxxi"></span>embraces all humanity in Himself, but
the archetype after Whom, and the final cause for Whom, man was made.
Every soul, when it proceeds from the hands of God, is pure, free and
immortal, with a natural affinity and capacity for good <span
id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md) , which can find its satisfaction only
in Christ, the ideal Man. But if Christ is thus everything to man,
humanity has also, in the foreordained purpose of God, something to
confer upon Christ. The temporary humiliation of the Incarnation has for
its result a higher glory than He possessed before <span
id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) , acquired through the harmony of the
two natures.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p206"></span>The course of this elevation is
represented by Hilary as a succession of births, in continuation of the
majestic series. First there had been the eternal generation of the Son;
then His creation for the ways and for the works of God, His
appointment, which Hilary regards as equivalent in importance to another
birth, to the office of Creator; next the Incarnation, the birth in time
which makes Him what He was not before, namely Man <span
id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md) . This is followed by the birth of
Baptism, of which Hilary speaks thrice <span
id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md) . He read in St. [Matthew iii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md)<span id="ii.iii.ii-p208.1"></span>,
instead of the familiar words of the Voice from heaven, ‘Thou art My
Son, this day have I begotten Thee.’ This was in his judgment the
institution of the sacrament of Baptism; because Christ was baptized, we
must follow His example. It was a new birth to Him, and therefore to us.
He had been the Son; He became through Baptism the perfect Son by this
fresh birth <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) . It is difficult to
see what Hilary’s thought was; perhaps he had not defined it to himself.
But, with this reading in his copy of the Gospel, it was necessary that
he should be ready with an explanation; and though there remained a
higher perfection to be reached, this birth in Baptism might well be
regarded as a stage in the return of Christ to His glory, an elevation
of His humanity to a more perfect congruity with His Godhead. This birth
is followed by another, the effect and importance of which is more
obvious, that of the Resurrection, ‘the birthday of His humanity to
glory <span id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323.md) .’ By the Incarnation He
had lost unity with the Father; but the created nature, by the
assumption of which He had disturbed the unity both within Himself and
in relation to the Father, is now raised to the level on which that
unity is again possible. In the Resurrection, therefore, it is restored;
and this stage of Christ’s achievement is regarded as a New birth <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) , by which His glory becomes, as it
had been before, the same as that of the Father. But now the glory is
shared by His humanity; the servant’s form is promoted to the glory of
God <span id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md) and the discordance comes to
an end. Christ, God and Man, stands where the Word before the
Incarnation stood. In this Resurrection, the only step in this Divine
work which is caused by sin, His full humanity partakes. In order to
satisfy all the conditions of actual human life, He died and visited the
lower world <span id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md) ; and also, as man
shall do, He rose again with the same body in which He had died <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md) . Then comes that final state, of
which something has already been said, when God shall be all in all. No
further change will be possible within the Person of Christ, for his
humanity, already in harmony with the Godhead, will now be transmuted.
The whole Christ, Man as well as God, will become wholly God. Yet the
humanity will still exist, for it is inseparable from the Divinity, and
will consist, as before, of body and soul. But there will be nothing
earthly or fleshly left in the body; its nature will be purely
spiritual <span id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328.md) . The only form in
which Hilary can express this result is the seeming paradox that Christ
will, by virtue of the final subjection, ‘be and continue what He is
not <span id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329.md) .’ By this return of <span
id="page_lxxxii">p. lxxxii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxxii"></span>the whole Christ into perfect union
with God, humanity attains the purpose of its creation. He was the
archetype after Whose likeness man was fashioned, and in His Person all
the possibilities of mankind are attained. And this great consummation
not only fulfils the destinies of humanity; it brings also an
augmentation of the glory of Him Who is glorified in Christ <span
id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p218"></span>In the fact that humanity is thus
elevated in Christ consists the hope of individual men. Man in Him has,
in a true sense, become God <span id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md) ;
and though Hilary as a rule avoids the phrase, familiar to him in the
writings of his Alexandrian teachers and freely used by Athanasius and
other of his contemporaries, that men become gods because God became
Man, still the thought which it coveys is constantly present to his
mind. As we have seen, men are created with such elevation as their
final cause; they have the innate certainty that their soul is of Divine
origin and a natural longing for the knowledge and hope of things
eternal <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332.md) . But they can only rise
by a process, corresponding to that by which the humanity in Christ was
raised to the level of the Divinity. This process begins with the new
birth in the one Baptism, and attains its completion when we fully
receive the nature and the knowledge of God. We are to be members of
Christ’s body and partakers in Him, saved into the name and the nature
of God <span id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md) . And the means to this
is knowledge of Him, received into a pure mind <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) . Such knowledge makes the soul of man
a dwelling rational, pure and eternal, wherein the Divine nature, whose
properties these are, may eternally abide <span
id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md) . Only that which has reason can be in
union with Him Who is reason. Faith must be accurately informed as well
as sincere. Christ became Man in order that we might believe Him; that
He might be a witness to us from among ourselves touching the things of
God <span id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p225"></span>We have now followed Hilary through his
great theory, in which we may safely say that no other theologian
entirely agrees, and which, where it is most original, diverges most
widely from the usual lines of Christian thought. Yet it nowhere
contradicts the accepted standards of belief; and if it errs it does so
in explanation, not in the statement of the truths which it undertakes
to explain. Hilary has the distinction of being the only one of his
contemporaries with the speculative genius to imagine this development
ending in the abolition of incongruity and in the restoration of the
full majesty of the Son and of man with Him <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) . He saw that there must be such a
development, and if he was wrong in tracing its course, there is a
reverence and loyalty, a solidity of reasoning and steady grasp of the
problems under discussion, which save him from falling into mere
ingenuity or ostentation. Sometimes he may seem to be on the verge of
heresy; but in each case it will be found that, whether his system be
right or no, the place in it which he has found for an argument used
elsewhere in the interests of error is one where the argument is
powerless for evil. Sometimes—and this is the most serious reproach that
can be brought against him—it must seem that his theology is abstract,
moving in a region apart from the facts of human life. It must be
admitted that this is the case; that though, as we shall presently see,
Hilary had a clear sense of the realities of temptation and sin and of
the need of redemption, and has expressed himself in these regards with
the fervour and practical wisdom of an earnest and experienced pastor,
still these subjects lie within the sphere of his feelings rather than
of his thought. It was not his fault that he lived in the days before
St. Augustine, and in the heat of an earlier controversy; and it is his
conspicuous merit that in his zeal for the Divinity of Christ he traced
the Incarnation back beyond the beginning of sin and found its motive in
God’s eternal <span id="page_lxxxiii">p. lxxxiii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxxiii"></span>purpose of uniting man to Himself. He
does not estimate the condescension of Christ by the distance which
separates the Sinless from the sinful. To his wider thought sin is not
the cause of that great sequence of Divine acts of grace, but a
disturbing factor which has modified its course. The measure of the love
of God in Christ is the infinity He overpassed in uniting the Creator
with the creature.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p227"></span>But before we approach the practical
theology of Hilary something must be said of his teaching concerning the
Third Person of the Trinity. The doctrine of the Holy Spirit is little
developed in his writings. The cause was, in part, his sympathy with
Eastern thought. The West, in this as in some other respects, was in
advance of the contemporary Greeks; but Hilary was too independent to
accept conclusions which were as yet unreasoned <span
id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) . But a stronger reason was that the
doctrine was not directly involved in the Arian controversy. On the main
question, as we have seen, he kept an open mind, and was prepared to
modify from time to time the terms in which he stated the Divinity of
our Lord; but in other respects he was often strangely archaic. Such is
the case here; Hilary’s is a logical position, but the logical process
has been arrested. There is nothing in his words concerning the Holy
Spirit inconsistent with the later definitions of faith <span
id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md) , and it would be unfair to blame him
because, in the course of a strenuous life devoted to the elucidation
and defence of other doctrines, he found no time to develope this;
unfair also to blame him for not recognising its full importance. In his
earlier days, and while he was in alliance with the Semiarians, there
was nothing to bring this doctrine prominently before his mind; in his
later life it still lay outside the range of controversy, so far as he
was concerned. Hilary, in fact, preferred like Athanasius to rest in the
indefinite terms of the original Nicene Creed, the confession of which
ended with the simple ‘And in the Holy Ghost.’ But there was a further
and practical reason for his reserve. It was a constant taunt of the
Arians that the Catholics worshipped a plurality of Gods. The frequency
and emphasis with which Hilary denies that Christians have either two
Gods or one God in solitude proves that he regarded this plausible
assertion as one of the most dangerous weapons wielded by heresy. It was
his object, as a skilful disputant, to bring his whole forces to bear
upon them, and this in a precisely limited field of battle. To import
the question of the Holy Spirit into the controversy might distract his
reader’s attention from the main issue, and afford the enemy an opening
for that evasion which he constantly accuses them of attempting. Hence,
in part, the small space allowed to so important a theme; and hence the
avoidance, which we noticed, of the very word ‘Trinity.’ The Arians made
the most of their argument about two Gods; Hilary would not allow them
the opportunity of imputing to the faithful a belief in three. This
might not have been a sufficient inducement, had it stood alone, but the
encouragement which he received from Origen’s vagueness, representative
as it was of the average theology of the third century, must have
predisposed him to give weight to the practical consideration. Yet
Hilary has not avoided a formal statement of his belief. In *Trin*. ii.
§§ 29–35, which is, as we saw, part of a summary statement of the
Christian Faith, he sets it forth with Scripture proofs. But he shows
clearly, by the short space he allows to it, that it is not in his eyes
of co-ordinate importance with the other truths of which he treats. And
the curious language in which he introduces the subject, in § 29, seems
to imply that he throws it in to satisfy others rather than from his own
sense of its necessary place in such a statement. The doctrine, as he
here defines it, is that the Holy Spirit undoubtedly exists; the Father
and the Son are the Authors of His being, and, since He is joined with
Them in our confession, <span id="page_lxxxiv">p. lxxxiv</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxxiv"></span>He cannot, without mutilation of the
Faith, be separated from Them. The fact that He is given to us is a
further proof of His existence. Yet the title ‘Spirit’ is often used
both for Father and for Son; in proof of this St. [John
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024.md), [2 Cor.
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.iii.ii-p229.1"></span> are cited. Yet the Holy Spirit has a
personal <span id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340.md) existence and a special
office in relation to us. It is through Him that we know God. Our nature
is capable of knowing Him, as the eye is capable of sight; and the gift
of the Spirit is to the soul what the gift of light is to the eye.
Again, in xii. §§ 55, 56, the subject is introduced, as if by an after
thought, and even more briefly than in the second book. As he has
refused to style the Son a creature, so he refuses to give that name to
the Spirit, Who has gone forth from God, and been sent by Christ. The
Son is the Only-begotten, and therefore he will not say that the Spirit
was begotten; yet he cannot call Him a creature, for the Spirit’s
knowledge of the mysteries of God, of which He is the Interpreter to
men, is the proof of His oneness in nature with God. The Spirit speaks
unutterable things and is ineffable in His operation. Hilary cannot
define, yet he believes. It must suffice to say, with the Apostle,
simply that He is the Spirit of God. The tone of § 56 seems that of
silent rebuke to some excess of definition, as he would deem it, of
which he had heard. To these passages must be added another in *Trin*.
viii. 19 f., where the possession by Father and Son of one Spirit is
used in proof of their own unity. But in this passage there occur
several instances of Hilary’s characteristic vagueness. As in ii. 30, so
here we are told that ‘the Spirit’ may mean Father or Son as well as
Holy Ghost <span id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341.md) , and instances are
given where the word has one or other of the two first significations.
Thus we must set a certain number of passages where a reference in
Scripture to the Holy Spirit is explained away against a number,
certainly no greater, in which He is recognised, and in the latter we
notice a strong tendency to understate the truth. For though we are
expressly told that the Spirit is not a creature, that He is from the
Father through the Son, is of one substance with Them and bears the same
relation to the One that He bears to the Other <span
id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342.md) , yet Hilary refuses with some
emphasis and in a conspicuous place, at the very end of the treatise, to
call Him God. But both groups of passages, those in which the Holy Ghost
is recognised and those in which reason is given for non-recognition,
are more than counterbalanced by a multitude in which, no doubt for the
controversial reason already mentioned, the Holy Spirit is left unnamed,
though it would have been most natural that allusion should be made to
Him <span id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343.md) . We find in Hilary ‘the
premises from which the Divinity of the Holy Ghost is the necessary
conclusion <span id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md) ;’ and there is
reason to believe that he would have stated the doctrine of the
Procession in the Western, not in the Eastern, form <span
id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md) ; but we find a certain willingness to
keep the doctrine in the background, which sufficiently indicates a
failure to grasp its cardinal importance, and is, however natural in his
circumstances and however interesting as evidence of his mode of
thought, a blemish to the *De Trinitate*, if we seek in it a balanced
exposition of the Faith <span id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p237"></span>We may now turn to the practical
teaching of Hilary. Henceforth he will be no longer the compiler of the
best Latin handbook of the Arian controversy, or the somewhat
unsystematic investigator of unexplored regions of theology. We shall
find him <span id="page_lxxxv">p. lxxxv</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxxv"></span>often accepting the common stock of
Christian ideas of his age, without criticism or attempt at improvement
upon them; often paraphrasing in even more emphatic language emphatic
and apparently contradictory passages of Scripture, without any effort
after harmony or balance. Yet sometimes we shall find him anticipating
on one page the thoughts of later theologians, while on another he is
content to repeat the views upon the same subject which had satisfied an
earlier generation. His doctrine, where it is not traditional, is never
more than tentative, and we must not be surprised, we must even expect,
to find him inconsistent with himself.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p238"></span>No subject illustrates this
inconsistency better than that of sin, of which Hilary gives two
accounts, the one Eastern and traditional, the other an anticipation of
Augustinianism. These are never compared and weighed the one against the
other. In the passages where each appears, it is adduced confidently,
without any reservation or hint that he is aware of another explanation
of the facts of experience. The more usual account is that which is
required by Hilary’s doctrine of the separate creation of every human
soul, which is good, because it is God’s immediate work, and has a
natural tendency to, and fitness for, perfection. Because God, after
Whose image man is made, is free, therefore man also is free; he has
absolute liberty, and is under no compulsion to good or to evil <span
id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md) . The sin which God foresees, as in
the case of Esau, He does not foreordain <span
id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md) . Punishment never follows except upon
sin actually committed; the elect are they who show themselves worthy of
election <span id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md) . But the human body
has defiled the soul; in fact, Hilary sometimes speaks as though sin
were not an act of will but an irresistible pressure exerted by the body
on the soul. If we had no body, he says once, we should have no sin; it
is a ‘body of death’ and cannot be pure. This is the spiritual meaning
of the ancient law against touching a corpse <span
id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md) . When the Psalmist laments that his
soul cleaveth to the ground, his sorrow is that it is inseparably
attached to a body of earth <span id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) ;
when Job and Jeremiah cursed the day of their birth, their anger was
directed against the necessity of living surrounded by the weaknesses
and vices of the flesh, not against the creation of their souls after
the image of God <span id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) . Such
language, if it stood alone, would convict its author of Manicheanism,
but Hilary elsewhere asserts that the desire of the soul goes half-way
to meet the invitation of sin <span id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) ,
and this latter in his normal teaching. Man has a natural proclivity to
evil, an inherited weakness <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md)
which has, as a matter of experience, betrayed all men into actual sin,
with the exception of Christ <span id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md) .
Elsewhere, however, Hilary recognises the possibility, under existing
conditions, of a sinless life. For David could make the prayer, ‘Take
from me the way of iniquity;’ of iniquity itself he was guiltless, and
only needed to pray against the tendency inherent in his bodily
nature <span id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md) . But such a case is
altogether exceptional; ordinary men must confide in the thought that
God is indulgent, for He knows our infirmity. He is propitiated by the
wish to be righteous, and in His judgment the merits of good men
outweigh their sins <span id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) . Hence a
prevalent tone of hopefulness about the future state of the baptized;
even Sodom and Gomorrah, their punishment in history having satisfied
the righteousness of God, shall ultimately be saved <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md) . Yet God has a perfect, immutable
goodness of which human goodness, though real, falls infinitely short,
because He is steadfast and we are driven by varying impulses <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) . This Divine goodness is the standard
and the hope set before us. It can only be attained by grace <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md) , and grace is freely offered. But
just as the soul, being free, advances to meet sin, so it must advance
to meet grace. Man must take the first step; he must wish and pray for
grace, and then perseverance in <span id="page_lxxxvi">p. lxxxvi</span>
<span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxxvi"></span>faith will be granted him <span
id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) , together with such a measure of the
Spirit as he shall desire and deserve <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) . He will, indeed, be able to do more
than he need, as David did when he spared and afterwards lamented Saul,
his worst enemy, and St. Paul, who voluntarily abstained from the lawful
privilege of marriage <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) . Such is
Hilary’s first account, ‘a naive, undeveloped mode of thought concerning
the origin of sin and the state of man <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) .’ Its inconsistencies are as obvious
as their cause, the unguarded homiletical expansion of isolated
passages. There is no attempt to reconcile man’s freedom to be good with
the fact of universal sin. The theory, so far as it is consistent, is
derived from Alexandria, from Clement and Origen. It may seem not merely
inadequate as theology, but philosophical rather than Christian; and its
aim is, indeed, that of strengthening man’s sense of moral
responsibility and of heightening his courage to withstand temptation.
But we must remember that Hilary everywhere assumes the union between
the Christian and Christ. While this union exists there is always the
power of bringing conduct into conformity with His will. Conduct, then,
is, comparatively speaking, a matter of detail. Sins of action and
emotion do not necessarily sever the union; a whole system of casuistry
might be built upon Hilary’s foundation. But false thoughts of God
violate the very principle of union between Him and man. However
abstract they may seem and remote from practical life, they are an
insuperable barrier. For intellectual harmony, as well as moral, is
necessary; and error of belief, like a key moving in a lock with whose
wards it does not correspond, forbids all access to the nature and the
grace of God. A good example of his relative estimate of intellectual
and moral offences occurs in the Homily on [Psalm
i.](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#000.md)<span id="ii.iii.ii-p256.1"></span>
§§ 6–8, where it is noteworthy that he does not trace back the former to
moral causes <span id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p258"></span>Against these, the expressions of
Hilary’s usual opinion, must be set others in which he anticipates the
language of St. Augustine in the Pelagian controversy. But certain
deductions must be made, before we can rightly judge the weight of his
testimony on the side of original sin. Passages where he is merely
amplifying the words of Scripture must be excluded, as also those which
are obviously exhibitions of unguarded rhetoric. For instance such words
as these, ‘Ever since the sin and unbelief of our first parent, we of
later generations have had sin for the father of our body and unbelief
for the mother of our soul <span id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) ,’
contradicting as they do Hilary’s well-known theory of the origin of the
soul, cannot be regarded as giving his deliberate belief concerning sin.
Again, we must be careful not to interpret strong language concerning
the body (e.g. *Tr. in Ps*. cxviii, *Caph*, 5 *fin*.), as though it
referred to our whole complex manhood. But after all deductions a good
deal of strong Augustinianism remains. In the person of Adam God created
all mankind, and all are implicated in his downfall, which was not only
the beginning of evil but is a continuous power <span
id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md) . Not only as a matter of experience,
is no man sinless, but no man can, by any possibility, be free from
sin <span id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) . Because of the sin of one
sentence is passed upon all <span id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md) ;
the sentence of slavery which is so deep a degradation that the victim
of sin forfeits even the name of man <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md) . But Hilary not only states the
doctrine; he approaches very nearly, on rare occasions, to the term
‘original sin <span id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371.md) .’ It follows that
nothing less than a regeneration, the free gift of God, will avail <span
id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372.md) ; and the grace by which the Christian
must be maintained is also His spontaneous <span id="page_lxxxvii">p.
lxxxvii</span> <span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxxvii"></span>and
unconditional gift. Faith, knowledge, Christian life, all have their
origin and their maintenance from Him <span
id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373.md) . Such is a brief statement of
Hilary’s position as a forerunner of St. Augustine. The passages cited
are scattered over his writings, from the earliest to the latest, and
there is no sign that the more modern view was gaining ground in his
mind as his judgment ripened. He had no occasion to face the question,
and was content to say whatever seemed obviously to arise from the words
under discussion, or to be most profitable to his audience. His
Augustinianism, if it may be called so, is but one of many instances of
originality, a thought thrown out but not developed. It is a symptom of
revolt against the inadequate views of older theologians; but it had
more influence upon the mind of his great successor than upon his own.
Dealing, as he did, with the subject in hortatory writings, hardly at
all, and only incidentally, in his formal treatise on the Trinity, he
preferred to regard it as a matter of morals rather than of doctrine.
And the dignity of man, impressed upon him by the great Alexandrians,
seemed to demand for humanity the fullest liberty.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p267"></span>We may now turn to the Atonement, by
which Christ has overcome sin. Hilary’s language concerning it is, as a
rule, simply Scriptural <span id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374.md) . He had
no occasion to discuss the doctrine, and his teaching is that which was
traditional in his day, without any such anticipations of future thought
as we found in his treatment of sin. Since the humanity of Christ is
universal, His death was on behalf of all mankind, ‘to buy the salvation
of the whole human race by the offering of this holy and perfect
Victim <span id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md) .’ His last cry upon the
cross was the expression of His sorrow that some would not profit by His
sacrifice; that He was not, as He had desired, bearing the sins of
all <span id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376.md) . He was able to take them
upon Him because He had both natures. His manhood could do what His
Godhead could not; it could atone for the sins of men. Man had been
overcome by Satan; Satan, in his turn, has been overcome by Man. In the
long conflict, enduring through Christ’s life, of which the first
pitched battle was the Temptation, the last the Crucifixion, the victory
has been won by the Mediator in the flesh <span
id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377.md) . The devil was in the wrong
throughout. He was deceived, or rather deceived himself, not recognising
what it was for which Christ hungered <span
id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378.md) . The same delusion as to Christ’s
character led him afterwards to exact the penalty of sin from One Who
had not deserved it <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md) . Thus the
human sufferings of Christ, unjustly inflicted, involve His enemy in
condemnation and forfeit his right to hold mankind enslaved. Therefore
we are set free <span id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380.md) , and the
sinless Passion and death are the triumph of the flesh over spiritual
wickedness and the vengeance of God upon it <span
id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381.md) . Man is set free, because he is
justified in Christ, Who is Man. But the fact that Christ could do the
works necessary to this end is proof that He is God. These works
included the endurance of such suffering—in the sense, of course, which
Hilary attaches to the word—as no one who was not more than man could
bear. Hence he emphasises the Passion, because in so doing he magnifies
the Divine nature of Him Who sustained it <span
id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382.md) . He sets forth the sufferings in the
light of deeds, of displays of power <span
id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md) , the greatest wonder being that the
Son of God should have made Himself passible. Yet though it was from
union with the Godhead that His humanity possessed the purity, the
willingness, the power to win this victory, and thought, in Hilary’s
words, it was immortal God Who died upon the Cross, still it was a
victory won not by God but by the flesh <span
id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md) . But the Passion must not be regarded
simply as an attack, ending in his own overthrow, made by Satan upon
Christ. It is also a free satisfaction offered to God by Christ as Man,
in order that His sufferings might release us from the punishment we had
deserved, being accepted instead of ours <span
id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md) . This latter was a thought peculiarly
<span id="page_lxxxviii">p. lxxxviii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxxviii"></span>characteristic of the West, and
especially of St. Cyprian’s teaching; but Hilary has had his share in
giving prominence to the propitiatory aspect of Christ’s
self-sacrifice <span id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md) . Yet it must be
confessed that the death of Christ is somewhat in the background; that
Hilary is less interested in its positive value than in its negative
aspect, as the cessation from earthly life and the transition to glory.
Upon this, and upon the evidential importance of the Passion as a
transcendent exertion of power, whereby the Son of God held Himself down
and constrained Himself to suffer and die, Hilary chiefly dwells. The
death has not, in his eyes, the interest of the Resurrection. The reason
is that it does not belong to the course of the Incarnation as
fore-ordained by God, but is only a modification of it, rendered
necessary by the sinful self-will of man. Had there been no Fall, the
visible, palpable flesh would still have been laid aside, though not by
death upon the Cross, when Christ’s work in the world was done; and
there would have been some event corresponding to the Ascension, if not
to the Resurrection. The body, laid aside on earth, would have been
resumed in glory; and human flesh, unfallen and therefore not corrupt,
yet free and therefore corruptible, would have entered into perfectly
harmonious union with His Divinity, and so have been rendered safe from
all possibility of evil. The purpose of raising man to the society of
God was anterior to the beginnings of sin; and it is this broader
conception that renders the Passion itself intelligible, while
relegating it to a secondary place. But Hilary, though as a rule he
mentions the subject not for its own sake but in the course of argument,
has as firm a faith in the efficacy of Christ’s death and of His
continued intercession in His humanity for mankind <span
id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387.md) as he has in His triumphant
Resurrection.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p282"></span>In regard to the manner in which man is
to profit by the Atonement, Hilary shews the same inconsistency as in
the case of sin. On the one hand, he lays frequent stress on knowledge
concerning God and concerning the nature of sin as the first conditions
of salvation; on the other, he insists, less often yet with equal
emphasis, upon its being God’s spontaneous gift to men, to be
appropriated only by faith. We have already seen that one of Hilary’s
positions is that man must take the first step towards God; that if we
will make the beginning He will give the increase <span
id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md) . This increase is the knowledge of
God imparted to willing minds <span id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389.md) ,
which lifts them up to piety. He states strongly the superiority of
knowledge to faith;—“There is a certain greater effectiveness in
knowledge than in faith. Thus the writer here did not believe; he
knew <span id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390.md) . For faith has the reward
of obedience, but it has not the assurance of ascertained truth. The
Apostle has indicated the breadth of the interval between the two by
putting the latter in the lower place in his list of the gifts of
graces. ‘To the first wisdom, to the next knowledge, to the third faith’
is his message <span id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391.md) ; for he who
believes may be ignorant even while he believes, but he who has come to
know is saved by his possession of knowledge from the very possibility
of unbelief <span id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392.md) .” This high
estimation of sound knowledge was due, no doubt, to the intellectual
character of the Arian conflict, in which each party retorted upon the
other the charge of ignorance and folly; and it must have been confirmed
by the observation that some who were conspicuous for the
misinterpretation of Scripture were notorious also for moral obliquity.
There was, however, that deeper reason which influenced all Hilary’s
thought; the conviction that if there is to be any harmony, any
understanding between God and the soul of man, it must be a perfect
harmony and understanding. And knowledge is pre-eminently the sphere in
which this is possible, for the revelation of God is clear and precise,
and unmistakable in its import <span id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393.md) .
But there was another, a directly practical <span id="page_lxxxix">p.
lxxxix</span> <span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_lxxxix"></span>reason for this
insistence. Apprehension of Divine truths is the unfailing test of a
Christian mind; conduct changes and faith varies in intensity, but the
facts of religion remain the same, and the believer can be judged by his
attitude towards them. Hence we cannot be surprised that Hilary
maintains the insufficiency of ‘simplicity of faith,’ and ranks its
advocates with heathen philosophers who regard purity of life as a
substitute for religion. God, he says, has provided copious knowledge,
with which we cannot dispense <span id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md) .
But this knowledge is to embrace not only the truth concerning God, but
also concerning the realities of human life. It is to be a knowledge of
the fact that sins have been committed and an opening of the eyes to
their enormity <span id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395.md) . This will be
followed by confession to God, by the promise to Him that we will
henceforth regard sin as He regards it, and by the profession of a firm
purpose to abandon it. Here again the starting-point is human knowledge.
When the right attitude towards sin, intellectually and therefore
morally, has been assumed, when there is the purpose of amendment and an
earnest and successful struggle against sensual and worldly temptations,
then we shall become ‘worthy of the favour of God <span
id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396.md) .’ In this light confession is
habitually regarded <span id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md) ; it is a
voluntary moral act, a self-enlightenment to the realities of sin,
necessarily followed by repugnance and the effort to escape, and
antecedent to Divine pardon and aid. But in contrast to this, Hilary’s
normal judgment, there are passages where human action is put altogether
in the background. Forgiveness is the spontaneous bounty of God,
overflowing from the riches of His loving-kindness, and faith the
condition of its bestowal and the means by which it is
appropriated <span id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md) . Even the
Psalmist, himself perfect in all good works, prayed for mercy; he put
his whole trust in God, and so must we <span
id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399.md) . And faith precedes knowledge also,
which is unattainable except by the believer <span
id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400.md) . Salvation does not come first, and
then faith, but through faith is the hope of salvation; the blind man
believed before he saw <span id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401.md) . Here
again, as in the case of sin, we have two groups of statements without
attempt at reconciliation; but that which lays stress upon human
initiative is far more numerous than the other, and must be regarded as
expressing Hilary’s underlying thought in his exhortations to Christian
conduct, to his doctrine of which we may now turn.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p297"></span>We must first premise that Christ’s
work as our Example as well as our Saviour is fully recognised. Many of
his deeds on earth were done by way of dispensation, in order to set us
a pattern of life and thought <span id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402.md) .
Christian life has, of course, its beginning in the free gift of
Baptism, with the new life and the new faculties then bestowed, which
render possible the illumination of the soul <span
id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md) . Hilary, as was natural at a time
when Baptism was often deferred by professed Christians, and there were
many converts from paganism, seems to contemplate that of adults as the
rule; and he feels it necessary to warn them that their Baptism will not
restore them to perfect innocence. In fact, by a strange conjecture
tentatively made, he once suggests that our Baptism is that wherewith
John baptized our Lord, and that the Baptism of the Holy Ghost awaits us
hereafter, in cleansing fires beyond the grave or in the purification of
martyrdom <span id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md) . Hilary nowhere says
in so many words that while Baptism abolishes sins previously committed,
alms and other good deeds perform a similar office for later offences,
but his view, which will be presently stated, concerning good works
shews that he agreed in this respect with St. Cyprian; neither, however,
would hold that the good works were sufficient in ordinary cases without
<span id="page_xc">p. xc</span> <span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xc"></span>the
further purification. Martyrdoms had, of course, ceased in Hilary’s day
throughout the Roman empire, but it is interesting to observe that the
old opinion, which had such power in the third century, still survived.
The Christian, then, has need for fear, but he has a good hope, for all
the baptized while in this world are still in the land of the living,
and can only forfeit their citizenship by wilful and persistent
unworthiness <span id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md) . The means for
maintaining the new life of effort is the Eucharist, which is equally
necessary with Baptism <span id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md) . But the
Eucharist is one of the many matters of practical importance on which
Hilary is almost silent, having nothing new to say, and being able to
assume that his readers and hearers were well informed and of one mind
with himself. His reticence is never a proof that he regarded them with
indifference.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p303"></span>The Christian life is thus a life of
hope and of high possibilities. But Hilary frankly and often recognises
the serious short-comings of the average believers of his day <span
id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md) . Sometimes, in his zeal for their
improvement and in the wish to encourage his flock, he even seems to
condone their faults, venturing to ascribe to God what may almost be
styled mere good-nature, as when he speaks of God, Himself immutable, as
no stern Judge of our changefulness, but rather appeased by the wish on
our part for better things than angry because we cannot perform
impossibilities. But in this very passage <span
id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) he holds up for our example the high
attainment of the Saints, explaining that the Psalmist’s words, ‘There
is none that doeth good, no not one,’ refer only to those who are
altogether gone out of the way and become abominable, and not to all
mankind. Indeed, holding as he does that all Christians may have as much
grace from God as they will take <span id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md)
, and that the conduct which is therefore possible is also necessary to
salvation, he could not consistently maintain the lower position. In
fact, the standard of life which Hilary sets in the *Homilies on the
Psalms* is very high. Cleanness of hand and heart is the first object at
which we must aim <span id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md) , and the Law
of God must be our delight. This is the lesson inculcated throughout his
discourses on [Psalm cxix.](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#000.md)<span
id="ii.iii.ii-p307.1"></span> He recognises the complexity of life, with
its various duties and difficulties, which are, however, a privilege
inasmuch as there is honour to be won by victory over them <span
id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md) ; and he takes a common-sense view of
our powers and responsibilities <span id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md)
. But though his tone is buoyant and life in his eyes is well worth
living for the Christian <span id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) , he
insists not merely upon a general purity of life, but upon renunciation
of worldly pleasures. Like Cyprian, he would apparently have the wealthy
believer dispose of his capital and spend his income in works of
charity, without thought of economy <span
id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md) . Like Cyprian, again, he denounces
the wearing of gold and jewellery <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) , and the attendance at public places
of amusement. Higher interests, spiritual and intellectual, must take
the place of such dissipation. Sacred melody will be more attractive
than the immodest dialogue of the theater, and study of the course of
the stars a more pleasing pursuit than a visit to the racecourse <span
id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md) . Yet strictly and even sternly
Christian as Hilary is, he does not allow us altogether to forget that
his is an age with another code than ours. Vengeance with him is a
Christian motive. He takes with absolute literalness the Psalmist’s
imprecations <span id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md) . Like every other
emotion which he expresses, that of delight at the punishment of evil
doers ought to have a place in the Christian soul. This was an
inheritance from the days of persecution, which were still within the
memory of living men. Cyprian often encourages the confessors to
patience by the prospect of seeing the wrath of God upon their enemies;
but he never gives so <span id="page_xci">p. xci</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xci"></span>strong expression to the feeling as
Hilary does, when he enforces obedience to our Lord’s command to turn
the other cheek by the consideration that fuller satisfaction will be
gained if the wrong be stored up against the Day of Judgement <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) . There is something hard and Puritan
in the tone which Hilary has caught from the men of the times of
persecution; and his conflict with heretics gave him ample opportunity
for indulgence in the thought of vengeance upon them. This was no mere
pardonable excitement of feeling; it was a Christian duty and privilege
to rejoice in the future destruction of his opponents. But there is an
even stranger difference between his standard and ours. Among the
difficulties of keeping in the strait and narrow way he reckons that of
truthfulness. A lie, he says, is often necessary, and deliberate
falsehood sometimes useful <span id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) . We
may mislead an assassin, and so enable his intended victim to escape;
our testimony may save a defendant who is in peril in the courts; we may
have to cheer a sick man by making light of his ailment. Such are the
cases in which the Apostle says that our speech is to be ‘seasoned with
salt.’ It is not the lie that is wrong; the point of conscience is
whether or no it will inflict injury upon another. Hilary is not alone
in taking falsehood lightly <span id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) ,
and allowance must be made for the age in which he lived. And his words
cast light upon the history of the time. The constant accusations made
against the character and conduct of theological opponents, which are so
painful a feature of the controversies of the early centuries, find
their justification in the principle which Hilary has stated. No harm
was done, rather a benefit was conferred upon mankind, if a false
teacher could be discredited in a summary and effective manner; such was
certainly a thought which presented itself to the minds of combatants,
both orthodox and heterodox. Apart from these exceptions, which,
however, Hilary would not have regarded as such, his standard of life,
as has been said, is a high one both in faith and in practice, and his
exhortation is full of strong common sense. It is, however, a standard
set for educated people; there is little attention paid to those who are
safe from the dangers of intellect and wealth. The worldliness which he
rebukes is that of the rich and influential; and his arguments are
addressed to the reading class, as are his numerous appeals to his
audience in the *Homilies on the Psalms* to study Scripture for
themselves. Indeed, his advice to them seems to imply that they have
abundant leisure for spiritual exercises and for reflection. But he does
not simply ignore the illiterate, still mostly pagans, for the work of
St. Martin of Tours only began, as we saw, in Hilary’s last days; in one
passage at least he speaks with the scorn of an ancient philosopher of
‘the rustic mind,’ which will fail to find the meaning of the
Psalms <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p319"></span>Hilary is not content with setting a
standard which his flock must strive to reach. He would have them attain
to a higher level than is commanded, and at the same time constantly
remember that they are failing to perform their duty to God. This higher
life is set before his whole audience as their aim. He recognises the
peculiar honour of the widow and the virgin <span
id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) , but has singularly little to say
about these classes of the Christian community, or about the clergy, and
no special counsel for them. The works of supererogation—the word is not
his—which he preaches are within the reach of all Christians. They
consist in the more perfect practice of the ordinary virtues. King <span
id="page_xcii">p. xcii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xcii"></span>David ‘was not content henceforth to be
confined to the express commands of the Law, nor to be subject to a mere
necessity of obedience.’ ‘The Prophet prays that these free-will
offerings may be acceptable to God, because the deeds done in compliance
to the Law’s edict are performed under the actual compulsion of
servitude <span id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) .’ As an instance he
gives the character of David. His duty was to be humble; he made himself
humble exceedingly, thus doing more than he was legally bound to do. He
spared his enemies so far as in him lay, and bewailed their death; this
was a free service to which he was bound by no compulsion. Such conduct
places those who practice it on the same level with those whose lives
are formally consecrated; the state of the latter being regarded, as
always in early times, as admirable in itself, and not as a means
towards higher things. Vigils and fasts and acts of mercy are the
methods advocated by Hilary for such attainment. But they must not stand
alone, nor must the Christian put his trust in them. Humility must have
faith for its principle, and fasting be combined with charity. <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) And the Christian must never forget
that though he may in some respects be doing more than he need, yet in
others he is certainly falling short. For the conflict is unceasing; the
devil, typified by the mountains in the Psalm, has been touched by God
and is smoking, but is not yet burning and powerless for mischief <span
id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) . Hence there is constant danger lest
the Christian fall into unbelief or unfruitfulness, sins equally
fatal <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) ; he must not trust in
himself, either that he can deserve forgiveness for the past or resist
future temptations <span id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) . Nor may he
dismiss his past offences from his memory. It can never cease to be good
for us to confess our former sins, even though we have become righteous.
St. Paul did not allow himself to forget that he had persecuted the
Church of God <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) . But there is a
further need than that of penitence. Like Cyprian before him and
Augustine after him, Hilary insists upon the value of alms in the sight
of God. The clothing of the naked, the release of the captive plead with
God for the remission of our sins <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) ; and the man who redeems his faults
by alms is classed among those who win His favour, with the perfect in
love and the blameless in faith <span id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md)
.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p329"></span>Thus the thought of salvation by works
greatly preponderates over that of salvation by grace. Hilary is fearful
of weakening man’s sense of moral responsibility by dwelling too much
upon God’s work which, however, he does not fail to recognise. Of the
two great dangers, that of faith and that of life, the former seemed to
him the more serious. God’s requirements in that respect were easy of
fulfilment; He had stated the truth and He expected it to be
unhesitatingly accepted. But if belief, being an exertion of the will,
was easy, misbelief must be peculiarly and fatally wicked. The
confession of St. Peter, the foundation upon which the Church is built,
is that Christ is God <span id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) ; the sin
against the Holy Ghost is denial of this truth <span
id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) . These are the highest glory and the
deepest shame of man. It does not seem that Hilary regarded any man,
however depraved, as beyond hope so long as he did not dispute this
truth; he has no code of mortal sins. But heresy concerning Christ,
whatever the conduct and character of the heretic, excludes all
possibility of salvation, for it necessarily cuts him off from the one
Faith and the one Church which are the condition and the sphere of
growth towards perfection; and the <span id="page_xciii">p. xciii</span>
<span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xciii"></span>severance is just, because
misbelief is a wilful sin. Since, then, compliance or non-compliance
with one of God’s demands, that for faith in His revelation, depends
upon the will, it was natural that Hilary should lay stress upon the
importance of the will in regard to God’s other demand, that for a
Christian life. This was, in a sense, a lighter requirement, for various
degrees of obedience were possible. Conduct could neither give nor deny
faith, but only affect its growth, while without the frank recognition
of the facts of religion no conduct could be acceptable to God. Life
presents to the will a constantly changing series of choices between
good and evil, while the Faith must be accepted or rejected at once and
as a whole. It is clear from Hilary’s insistence upon this that the
difficulties, apart from heresy, with which he had to contend resembled
those of Mission work in modern India. There were many who would accept
Christianity as a revelation, yet had not the moral strength to live in
conformity with their belief. Of such persons Hilary will not despair.
They have the first essential of salvation, a clear and definite
acceptance of doctrinal truth; they have also the offer of sufficient
grace, and the free will and power to use it. And time and opportunity
are granted, for the vicissitudes of life form a progressive education;
they are, if taken aright, the school, the training-ground for
immortality <span id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) . This is because
all Christians are in Christ, by virtue of His Incarnation. They are, as
St. Paul says, complete in Him, furnished with the faith and hope they
need. But this is only a preparatory completeness; hereafter they shall
be complete in themselves, when the perfect harmony is attained and they
are conformed to his glory <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) .
Thus to the end the dignity and responsibility of mankind is maintained.
But it is obvious that Hilary has failed to correlate the work of Christ
with the work of the Christian. The necessity of His guidance and aid,
and the manner in which these are bestowed, is sufficiently stated, and
the duty of the Christian man is copiously and eloquently enforced. But
the importance of Christ’s work within Himself, in harmonising the two
natures, has withdrawn most of Hilary’s attention from His work within
the believing soul; and the impression which Hilary’s writings leave
upon the mind concerning the Saviour and redeemed mankind is that of
allied forces seeking the same end but acting independently, each in a
sphere of its own.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p334"></span>There still remains to be considered
Hilary’s account of the future state. The human soul, being created
after the image of God, is imperishable; resurrection is as inevitable
as death <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) . And the resurrection
will be in the body, for good and bad alike. The body of the good will
be glorified, like that of Christ; its substance will be the same as in
the present life, its glory such that it will be in all other respects a
new body <span id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) . Indeed, the true life
of man only begins when this transformation takes place <span
id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) . No such change awaits the wicked; we
shall all rise, but we shall not all be changed, as St. Paul says <span
id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) . They remain as they are, or rather
are subjected to a ceaseless process of deterioration, whereby the soul
is degraded to the level of the body, while this in the case of others
is raised, either instantly or by a course of purification, to the level
of the soul <span id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) . Their last state
is vividly described in language which recalls that of Virgil; crushed
to powder and dried to dust they will fly for ever before the wind of
God’s wrath <span id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) . For the thoroughly
good and the thoroughly bad the final state begins at the moment of
death. There is no judgment for either class, but only for those whose
character contains elements of both good and evil <span
id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md) . But perfect goodness is only a
theoretical possibility, and Hilary is not certain of the condemnation
of any except wilful unbelievers. Evil is mingled in varying proportions
with good in the character of men at large; God can detect it in the
very best. All therefore <span id="page_xciv">p. xciv</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xciv"></span>need to be purified after death, if they
are to escape condemnation on the Day of Judgment. Even the Mother of
our Lord needs the purification of pain; this is the sword which should
pierce through her soul <span id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442.md) . All
who are infected by sin, the heretic who has erred in ignorance among
them <span id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md) , must pass through
cleansing fires after death. Then comes the general Resurrection. To the
good it brings the final change to perfect glory; the bad will rise only
to return to their former place <span id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md)
. The multitude of men will be judged, and after the education and
purification of suffering to which, by God’s mercy, they have been
submitted, will be accepted by Him. Hilary’s writings contain no hint
that any who are allowed to present themselves on the Day of Judgment
will then be rejected.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p345"></span>We have now completed the survey of
Hilary’s thoughts. Many of these were strange and new to his
contemporaries, and his originality, we may be sure, deprived him of
some of the influence he wished to exert in the controversies of his
day. Yet he shared the spirit and entered heartily into the interests
and conflicts of his age, and therefore his thoughts in many ways were
different from our own. To this we owe, no doubt, the preservation of
his works; writings which anticipated modern opinion would have been
powerless for good in that day, and would not have survived to ours.
Thus from his own century to ours Hilary has been somewhat isolated and
neglected, and even misunderstood. Yet he is one of the most notable
figures in the history of the early Church, and must be numbered among
those who have done most to make Christian thought richer and more
exact. If we would appreciate him aright as one of the builders of the
dogmatic structure of the Faith, we must omit from the materials of our
estimate a great part of his writings, and a part which has had a wider
influence than any other. His interpretation of the letter, though not
of the spirit, of Scripture must be dismissed; interesting as it always
is, and often suggestive, it was not his own and was a hindrance, though
he did not see it, to the freedom of his thought. Yet his exegesis in
detail is often admirable. For instance, it would not be easy to
overpraise his insight and courage in resisting the conventional
orthodoxy, sanctioned by Athanasius in his own generation and by
Augustine in the next, which interpreted St. Paul’s ‘first-born of every
creature’ as signifying the Incarnation of Christ, and not His eternal
generation <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) . We must omit also
much that Hilary borrowed without question from current opinion; it is
his glory that he concentrated his attention upon some few questions of
supreme importance, and his strength, not his weakness, that he was
ready to adopt in other matters the best and wisest judgments to which
he had access. An intelligent, and perhaps ineffective, curiosity may
keep itself abreast of the thought of the time, to quote a popular
phrase; Hilary was content to survey wide regions of doctrine and
discipline with the eyes of Origen and of Cyprian. This limitation of
the interests of a powerful mind has enabled him to penetrate further
into the mysteries of the Faith than any of his predecessors; to points,
in fact, where his successors have failed to establish themselves. We
cannot blame him that later theologians, starting where he left off,
have in some directions advanced further still. The writings of Hilary
are the quarry whence many of the best thoughts of Ambrose and of Leo
are hewn. Eminent and successful as these men were, we cannot rank them
with Hilary as intellectually his equals; we may even wonder how many of
their conclusions they would have drawn had not Hilary supplied the
premises. It is a greater honour that the unrivalled genius of Augustine
is deeply indebted to him. Nor may we blame him, save lightly, for some
rashness and error in his speculations. He set out, unwillingly, as we
know, but not half-heartedly, upon his novel journey of exploration. He
had not, as we have, centuries of criticism behind him, and could not
know that some of the <span id="page_xcv">p. xcv</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xcv"></span>avenues he followed would lead him
astray. It may be that we are sober because we are, in a sense,
disillusioned; that modern Christian thought which starts from the old
premises tends to excess of circumspection. And certainly Hilary would
not have earned his fame as one of the most original and profound of
teachers, whose view of Christology is one of the most interesting in
the whole of Christian antiquity <span id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md)
, had he not been inspired by a sense of freedom and of hope in his
quest. Yet great as was his genius and reverent the spirit in which he
worked, the errors into which he fell, though few, were serious. There
are instances in which he neglects his habitual balancing of
corresponding infinities; as when he shuts his eyes to half the
revelation, and asserts that Christ could not be ignorant and could not
feel pain. And there is that whole system of dispensations which he has
built up in explanation of Christ’s life on earth; a system against
which our conscience and our common sense rebel, for it contradicts the
plain words of Scripture and attributes to God ‘a process of Divine
reserve which is in fact deception <span
id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md) .’ We may compare Hilary’s method in
such cases to the architecture of Gloucester and of Sherborne, where the
ingenuity of a later age has connected and adorned the massive and
isolated columns of Norman date by its own light and graceful drapery of
stonework. We cannot but admire the result; yet there is a certain
concealment of the original design, and perhaps a perilous cutting away
of the solid structure. But, in justice to Hilary, we must remember that
in these speculations he is venturing away from the established
standards of doctrine. When he is enunciating revealed truths, or
arguing onward from them to conclusions towards which they point, he has
the company of the Creeds, or at least they indicate the way he must go.
But in explaining the connection between doctrine and doctrine he is
left to his own guidance. It is as though a traveller, not content to
acquaint himself with the highroads, should make his way over hedge and
ditch from one of them to another; he will not always hit upon the best
and straightest course. But at least Hilary’s conclusions, though
sometimes erroneous, were reached by honest and reverent reasoning, and
neither ancient nor modern theology can afford to reproach him. The
tendency of the former, especially offer the rise of Nestorius, was to
exaggerate some of his errors; and the latter has failed to develope and
enforce some of his highest teaching.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p349"></span>This is, indeed, worthy of all
admiration. On the moral side of Christianity we see him insisting upon
the voluntary character of Christ’s work; upon His acts of will, which
are a satisfaction to God and an appeal to us <span
id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md) . On the intellectual side we find the
Unity in Trinity so luminously declared that Bishop French of Lahore,
one of the greatest of missionaries, had the works of Hilary constantly
in his hands, and contemplated a translation of the *De Trinitate* into
Arabic for the benefit of Mohammedans <span
id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md) . This was not because Hilary’s
explanation of our Lord’s sufferings might seem to commend the Gospel to
their prejudices; such a concession would have been repugnant to
French’s whole mode of thought. It was because in the central argument
on behalf of the Godhead of Christ, where he had least scope for
originality of thought, Hilary has never suffered himself to become a
mere mechanical compiler. The light which he has cast upon his sub<span
id="page_xcvi">p. xcvi</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xcvi"></span>ject, though clear, is never hard; and
the doctrine which, because it was attractive to himself, he has made
attractive to his readers, is that of the unity of God, the very
doctrine which is of supreme importance in Mohammedan eyes <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p353"></span>But, above all, it is Hilary’s doctrine
concerning the Incarnation as the eternal purpose of God for the union
of the creature with the Creator, that must excite our interest and
awaken our thoughts. He renders it, on the one hand, impossible to rate
too highly the dignity of man, created to share the nature and the life
of God; impossible, on the other hand, to estimate highly enough the
condescension of Christ in assuming humanity. It is by His humiliation
that we are saved; by the fact that the nature of man was taken by his
Maker, not by the fact that Christ, being man, remained sinless. For sin
began against God’s will and after His counsel was formed; it might
deflect the march of His purpose towards fulfilment, but could no more
impede its consummation than it could cause its inception. The true
salvation of man is not that which rescues him, when corrupt, from sin
and its consequences, but that which raises him, corruptible, because
free, even though he had not become corrupt, into the safety of union
with the nature of God. Human life, though pure from actual sin, would
have been aimless and hopeless without the Incarnation. And the human
body would have had no glory, for its glory is that Christ has taken it,
worn it awhile in its imperfect state, laid it aside and finally resumed
it in its perfection. All this He must have done, in accordance with
God’s purpose, even though the Fall had never occurred. Hence the
Incarnation and the Resurrection are the facts of paramount interest;
the death of Christ, corresponding as it does to the hypothetical laying
aside of the unglorified flesh, loses something of its usual prominence
in Christian thought. It is represented as being primarily for Christ
the moment of transition, for the Christian the act which enables him to
profit by the Incarnation; but it is the Incarnation itself whereby, in
Hilary’s words, we are saved into the nature and the name of God. But
though we may feel that this great truth is not stated in its full
impressiveness, we must allow that the thought which has taken the
foremost place is no mere academic speculation. And, after all, sin and
the Atonement are copiously treated in his writings, though they do not
control his exposition of the Incarnation. Yet even in this there are
large spaces of his argument where these considerations have a place,
though only to give local colour, so to speak, and a sense of reality to
the description of a purpose formed and a work done for man because he
is man, not because he is fallen. But if Hilary has somewhat erred in
placing the Cross in the background, he is not in error in magnifying
the scope of the reconciliation <span id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md)
which includes it as in a wider horizon. Man has in Christ the nature of
God; the infinite Mind is intelligible to the finite. The Creeds are no
dry statement of facts which do not touch our life; the truths they
contain are the revelation of God’s self to us. Not for the pleasure of
weaving theories, but in the interests of practical piety, Hilary has
fused belief and conduct into the unity of that knowledge which Isaiah
foresaw and St. John possessed; the knowledge which is not a means
towards life, but life itself.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p3"></span> Those which have been in constant use in
the preparation of this chapter have been an excellent article by Th.
Förster in the *Theologische Studien und Kritiken* for 1888, p. 645 ff.,
and two full and valuable papers by Dr. Baltzer on the *Theologie* and
*Christologie* of Hilary in the *Programm* of the Rottweil Gymnasium for
1879 and 1889 respectively. I have unfortunately not had access to
Wirthmüller’s work, *Die Lehre d. hl. Hil. über die Selbstentäusserung
Christi*, but the citations in Baltzer and Schwane give some clue to its
contents. The Introduction to the Benedictine edition is useful, though
its value is lessened by an evident desire to make Hilary conform to the
accepted opinions of a later age. Dorner’s great work on the *Doctrine
of the Person of Christ*, in the English translation, with the
*Dogmengeschichte* of Schwane (ed. 2, 1895) and that of Harnack (ed. 3,
1894) have also been constantly and profitably consulted. Indebtedness
to other works is from time to time acknowledged in the notes.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p30"></span> The unhesitating use of the Theophanies
of the Old Testament as direct evidence for the divinity of Christ is
noteworthy. Similar to the usual proofs for the distinction of Persons

the arguments in *Tr. in Ps.* cxviii., *Iod*, 5, cxxvii. 4.

in this volume may give a somewhat false impression in this respect. For
the sake of conciseness the word *Person* has been often used in the
English where it is absent, and absent designedly in the Latin. The word
occurs *Trin.* iii. 23 *in*., iv. 42, v. 10, 26, vii. 39, 40, and in a

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p40"></span> It occurs in the *De Synodis* 69, but
in that work Hilary is writing as an advocate in defence of language
used by others, not as the exponent of his own thoughts. It also occurs
once or twice in translations from the Greek, probably by another hand
than Hilary’s; but from his own authorship it is completely absent.

living Nature.’ Often enough the substance or nature of God or Christ is
simply a periphrasis. The two natures in the Incarnate Christ are also
mentioned, though, as we shall see, Hilary here also avoids a precise
nomenclature.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p60"></span> It constantly appears, though with all
due safeguards, in the *De Synodis*, where sympathy as well as policy
impelled him to approximate the language used by his friends. Similarly
in *Trin*. iii. 23, he argues, from the admitted likeness, that there
can be no difference. But, as we saw, this part of the *De Trinitate* is
probably an early work, and does not represent Hilary’s later thought.

Similarly in the *Eumenides* 637, Æschylus makes Apollo excuse Orestes’
murder of Clytænnestra on the ground that the mother is not the parent,
but only the nurse of the germ. This is contrary to Aristotle’s
teaching; Æschylus and Hilary evidently represent a rival current of
ancient opinion.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p92"></span> *Trin*. x. 20. In *Tr. in Ps.* cxviii.,
*Iod,* 6, 7, this thought is developed. Man has a double origin. First,
he is made after the likeness of God. This is the soul, which is
immaterial and has no resemblance and owes no debt, as of effect to
cause, to any other nature (i.e. substance) than God. It is not His
likeness, but is after His likeness. Secondly, there is the body,
composed of earthly matter.

Nyssa.

id="ii.iii.ii-p94.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p95"></span> This view that the conception by the
Holy Ghost means conception by the Son is consistently held by Hilary
throughout his writings. It appears in the earliest of them; in *Comm.
in Matt*. ii. 5, Christ is ‘born of a woman;…Made flesh through the
Word.’ So in *Trin*. ii. 24, He is ‘born of the Virgin and of the Holy
Ghost, Himself ministering to Himself in this operation.…By His own,
that is God’s, overshadowing power He sowed for Himself the beginnings
of His body and ordained that His flesh should commence to exist; and
Trin. x 16.

id="ii.iii.ii-p95.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p96"></span> *Trin*. x. 16; cf. *ib*. 17. In the
*Instructio Psalmorum*, § 6, he speaks in more usual language;—*adventus
Domini ex virgine in hominem procreandi*, and also in some other
passages. Dorner’s view (I. ii. 403 f. and note 74, p. 533) differs from
that here taken. But he is influenced (see especially p. 404) by the
desire to save Hilary’s consistency rather than to state his actual
opinion. And Hilary was too early in the field, too anxiously employed
in feeling his way past the pitfalls of heresy, to escape the danger of
occasional inconsistency.

greater accuracy than his contemporaries in laying stress upon each of
the constituent elements of Christ’s humanity, and especially upon the
soul; in this respect following Tertullian and Origen.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p104"></span> In *Trin*. x. 21 f. is an argument

He is God because He is perfectly like God.

Schwane, p. 272 f. Other explanations which have been suggested are
quite inadmissible. Dorner, p. 407, takes the passage cited above about
‘substance’ too seriously, and wavers between the equally impossible
interpretations of ‘countenance’ and ‘personality.’ Förster (l.c. p.
659) understands the word to mean ‘mode of existence.’ Wirthmüller,
cited by Schwane, p. 273, has the courage to regard ‘form of God’ and
‘form of a servant’ as equivalent to Divinity and humanity.

*hominem ad sumpsit* is the normal phrase. In *Tr. in Ps*. lxviii. 4, he
speaks as if the two natures had been forced to coalesce by a Power
higher than either. But, as we have seen, in this part of the Homily
Hilary’s language is destitute of theological exactness.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p147"></span> Hilary was undoubtedly influenced more
than he knew by the Latin words *pati* and *dolere*, the one purely
objective, the other subjective. By a line of thought which recalls that
of Mozley concerning Miracles he refuses to argue from our experience to
that of Christ. That He suffered, in the sense of having wounds and
death inflicted upon Him, is a fact; that He was conscious of suffering
is an inference, a supposition (*putatur dolere quia patitur, Tr. in
Ps*. cxxxviii. 3, *fallitur ergo humanæ æstimationis opinio putans hunc
dolere quod patitur*, *Trin*. x. 47), and one which we are not entitled
to make. In fact, the passage last cited states that He has no *natura
dolendi*; so also x. 23, 35, and cf. *Tr. in [Ps.
liii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#000.md)<span
id="ii.iii.ii-p147.1"></span>* 12. Or as Hilary puts it, *Trin.* x. 24,
He is subject to the *naturæ passionum* not to their iniuriæ.

obliged Him to emphasize the suffering; it was natural, though not
logical, that he should sometimes insist also upon the feeling.

deliberate belief. But in earlier life he had written rashly of the Holy
Spirit (i.e. God the Son) surrendering His humanity to be tempted, and
of the cry upon the Cross ‘testifying the departure of God the Word from
Him’ (*Comm. in Matt*. iii. 1, xxxiii. 6). This, if it had represented
Hilary’s teaching in that treatise would have proved it heretical; but
the whole tenour of the commentary proves that this was simply
carelessness. In the Homilies on the Psalms he also writes somewhat
loosely on occasion; e.g. liii. 4 *fin*., where he mentions Christ’s
*former* nature, i.e. the Divinity, and *ib*. 5, where he speaks of ‘Him
Who *after being God* (*ex Deo*) had died as man.’ But only malevolence
could give an evil interpretation to these passages, delivered as they
were for the edification of Hilary’s flock, and with no thought of
theological accuracy. It is, indeed, quite possible that they were never
revised, or even intended, for publication by him.

been taken of putting ‘Himself’ for ‘itself.’ On the same page Dorner
speaks of ‘ever increasing return of the Logos into equality with
Himself.’ This is a contradiction of his own explanation. God has become
God-man. He could not again become simply the Logos. The key to Hilary’s
position is the double nature of Christ. The Godhead and the Manhood are
aspects in revelation, abstractions in argument. That which connects
them and gives them reality is the one Person, the object of thought and
faith.

would still required raising to his name and nature.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p236"></span> The work by Tertullian in which the
doctrine of the Spirit is most fully brought out; in which, in fact, He
is first expressly named God, is the *Adversus Praxean*. It was written
after his secession from the Church, and Hilary, upon whom it had more
influence than any other of Tertullian’s writings, may have suspected
that this teaching was the expression of his Montanism rather than a
legitimate deduction from Scripture, and so have been misled by over
caution. He may also have been influenced by such Biblical passages as
[Rev. xiv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md)<span

from his silence as to the existence, or the importance in his eyes, of
her institutions.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p317"></span> Hermas, *Mand.* iii. 3, confesses to
wholesale lying; he had never heard that it was wrong. But the writer of
the *Shepherd* does not represent his mouthpiece as a model of virtue.
It is more significant that Tertullian, *Pud*. 19, classes breach of
trust and lying among slight sins which may happen to anyone any day.
This was in his strictest and most censorious period. There are grave
difficulties in reconciling some of Cyprian’s statements concerning his
opponents with one another and with probability, but he has not ventured
upon any general extenuation of the vice.

antithesis is between *legitima* and *voluntaria*.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p322"></span> l.c. *Nun*, 14, *Comm. in Matt.* v. 2.
In the latter passage there is a piece of practical advice which shews
that public fasts were generally recognised. Hilary tells his readers
that they must not take literally our Lord’s command to anoint
themselves when they fast. If they do, they will render themselves
conspicuous and ridiculous. The passage, *Comm. in Matt.* xxvii. 5, 6,
on the parables of the Virgins with their lamps and of the Talents
cannot be taken, as by Förster, as evidence that Hilary rejected the
later doctrine of the supererogatory righteousness of the Saints. He is
speaking of the impossibility of contemporaries conveying righteousness
to one another in the present life, and his words have no bearing on
that doctrine.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p350"></span> Schwane, ii. 271, says, ‘Though we
reject that part of it which attributes a natural impassibility to the
body of Christ, yet Hilary’s exposition presents one truth more clearly
than the earlier Fathers had stated it, by giving to the doctrine of the
representative satisfaction of Christ its reasonable explanation as a
*free* service of satisfaction. He conceives rightly of the Lord’s whole
life on earth, with all its troubles and infirmities, as a sacrifice of
free love on the part of the God-Man; it is only his closer definition
of this sacrifice that is inaccurate.…Hilary lays especial stress upon
the freedom of the Lord s acceptance of death.’ He quotes *Trin.* x. 11.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p351"></span> He had evidently been long familiar
with it (*Life,* i. 155), but the first mention of its use for
missionary purposes is in 1862 (*ib*. i. 137). He began the translation
into Arabic at Tunis in 1890, after his resignation of the bishopric of
Lahore (ii. 333), but it seems doubtful whether he was able to make any
progress with it at Muscat. His biographer says nothing of the amount
actually accomplished.
