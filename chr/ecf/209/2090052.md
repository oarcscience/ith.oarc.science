<span id="iii.iv.ii.i-Page_18b"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.i-p1.1"></span>Book II.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii.i-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*Concerning æon or age.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.i-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.i-p3.1"></span>He</span> created the ages Who Himself was
before the ages, Whom the divine David thus addresses, *From age to age
Thou art* <span id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md) . The divine
apostle also says, *Through Whom He created the ages* <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.i-p6"></span>It must then be understood that the
word age has various meanings, for it denotes many things. The life of
each man is called an age. Again, a period of a thousand years is called
an age <span id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641.md) . Again, the whole
course of the present life is called an age: also the future life, the
immortal life after the resurrection <span
id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642.md) , is spoken of as an age. Again,
the word age is used to denote, not time nor yet a part of time as
measured by the movement and course of the sun, that is to say, composed
of days and nights, but the sort of temporal motion and interval that is
co-extensive with eternity <span id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643.md) .
For age is to things eternal just what time is to things temporal.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.i-p10"></span>Seven ages <span
id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644.md) of this world are spoken of, that
is, from the creation of the heaven and earth till the general
consummation and resurrection of men. For there is a partial
consummation, viz., the death of each man: but there is also a general
and complete consummation, when the general resurrection of men will
come to pass. And the eighth age is the age to come.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.i-p12"></span>Before the world was formed, when
there was as yet no sun dividing day from night, there was not an age
such as could be measured <span id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645.md) ,
but there was the sort of temporal motion and interval that is
co-extensive with eternity. And in this sense there is but one age, and
God is spoken of as <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.i-p13.1"></span>αἰ& 240·νιος</span> <span
id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646.md) and <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.i-p14.2"></span>προαιώνιος</span>, for the age or æon
itself is His creation. For God, Who alone is without beginning, is
Himself the Creator of all things, whether age or any other existing
thing. And when I say God, it is evident that I mean the Father and His
Only begotten Son, our Lord, Jesus Christ, and His all-holy Spirit, our
one God.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.i-p15"></span>But we speak also of ages of ages,
inasmuch as the seven ages of the present world include many ages in the
sense of lives of men, and the one age embraces all the ages, and the
present and the future are spoken of as age of age. Further, everlasting
(i.e. <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.ii.i-p15.1"></span>αἰ&
240·νιος</span>) life and everlasting punishment prove that the age or
æon to come is unending <span id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647.md) . For
time will not be counted by days and nights even after the resurrection,
but there will rather be one day with no evening, wherein the Sun of
Justice will shine brightly on the just, but for the sinful there will
be night profound and limitless. In what way then will the period of one
thousand years be counted which, according to Origen <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648.md) , is required for the complete
restoration? Of all the ages, therefore, the sole creator is God Who
hath also created the universe and Who was before the ages.
