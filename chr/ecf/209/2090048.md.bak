<span id="iii.iv.i.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*Concerning the Same.*

<span id="iii.iv.i.xii-p2"></span>The following, then, are the mysteries
which we have learned from the holy oracles, as the divine Dionysius the
Areopagite said <span id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md) : that God is
the cause and beginning of all: the essence of all that have essence:
the life of the living: the reason of all rational beings: the intellect
of all intelligent beings: the recalling and restoring of those who fall
away from Him: the renovation and transformation of those that corrupt
that which is natural: the holy foundation of those who are tossed in
unholiness: the steadfastness of those who have stood firm: the way of
those whose course is directed to Him and the hand stretched forth to
guide them upwards. And I shall add He is also the Father of all His
creatures (for God, Who brought us into being out of nothing, is in a
stricter sense our Father than are our parents who have derived both
being and begetting from Him <span id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md)
): the shepherd of those who follow and are tended by Him: the radiance
of those who are enlightened: the initiation of the initiated: the
deification of the deified: the peace of those at discord: the
simplicity of those who love simplicity: the unity of those who worship
unity: of all beginning the beginning, super-essential be<span
id="page_14b">p. 14b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.i.xii-Page_14b"></span>cause above all beginning <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600.md) : and the good revelation of what
is hidden, that is, of the knowledge of Him so far as that is lawful for
and attainable by each.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xii-p6"></span>*Further and more accurately
concerning divine names* <span id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md)

<span id="iii.iv.i.xii-p8"></span>The Deity being incomprehensible is
also assuredly nameless. Therefore since we know not His essence, let us
not seek for a name for His essence. For names are explanations of
actual things <span id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md) . But God, Who
is good and brought us out of nothing into being that we might share in
His goodness, and Who gave us the faculty of knowledge, not only did not
impart to us His essence, but did not even grant us the knowledge of His
essence. For it is impossible for nature to understand fully the
supernatural <span id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md) . Moreover, if
knowledge is of things that are <span
id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604.md) , how can there be knowledge of the
super-essential? Through His unspeakable goodness, then, it pleased Him
to be called by names that we could understand, that we might not be
altogether cut off from the knowledge of Him but should have some notion
of Him, however vague. Inasmuch, then, as He is incomprehensible, He is
also unnameable. But inasmuch as He is the cause of all and contains in
Himself the reasons and causes of all that is, He receives names drawn
from all that is, even from opposites: for example, He is called light
and darkness, water and fire: in order that we may know that these are
not of His essence but that He is super-essential and unnameable: but
inasmuch as He is the cause of all, He receives names from all His
effects.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xii-p12"></span>Wherefore, of the divine names, some
have a negative signification, and indicate that He is
super-essential <span id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605.md) : such are
“non-essential <span id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md) ,” “timeless,”
“without beginning,” “invisible”: not that God is inferior to anything
or lacking in anything (for all things are His and have become from Him
and through Him and endure in Him <span
id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607) .md), but that He is pre-eminently
separated from all that is. For He is not one of the things that are,
but over all things. Some again have an affirmative signification, as
indicating that He is the cause of all things. For as the cause of all
that is and of all essence, He is called both Ens and Essence. And as
the cause of all reason and wisdom, of the rational and the wise, He is
called both reason and rational, and wisdom and wise. Similarly He is
spoken of as Intellect and Intellectual, Life and Living, Power and
Powerful, and so on with all the rest. Or rather those names are most
appropriate to Him which are derived from what is most precious and most
akin to Himself. That which is immaterial is more precious and more akin
to Himself than that which is material, and the pure than the impure,
and the holy than the unholy: for they have greater part in Him. So
then, sun and light will be more apt names for Him than darkness, and
day than night, and life than death, and fire and spirit and water, as
having life, than earth, and above all, goodness than wickedness: which
is just to say, being more than not being. For goodness is existence and
the cause of existence, but wickedness is the negation of goodness, that
is, of existence. These, then, are the affirmations and the negations,
but the sweetest names are a combination of both: for example, the
super-essential essence, the Godhead that is more than God, the
beginning that is above beginning and such like. Further there are some
affirmations about God which have in a pre-eminent degree the force of
denial: for example, darkness: for this does not imply that God is
darkness but that He is not light, but above light.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xii-p16"></span>God then is called Mind and Reason
and Spirit and Wisdom and Power, as the cause of these, and as
immaterial, and maker of all, and omnipotent <span
id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608.md) . And these names are common to the
whole Godhead, whether affirmative or negative. And they are also used
of each of the subsistences of the Holy Trinity in the very same and
identical way and with their full significance <span
id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609.md) . For when I think of one of the
subsistences, I recognise it to be perfect God and perfect essence: but
when I combine and reckon the three together, I know one perfect God.
For the Godhead is not compound but in three perfect subsistences, one
perfect indivisible and uncompound God. And when I think of the relation
of the three subsistences to each other, I perceive that the Father is
super-essential Sun, source of goodness, fathomless sea of essence,
reason, wisdom, power, light, divinity: the generating and productive
source <span id="page_15b">p. 15b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.i.xii-Page_15b"></span>of good hidden in it. He Himself then
is mind, the depth of reason, begetter of the Word, and through the Word
the Producer <span id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610.md) of the revealing
Spirit. And to put it shortly, the Father has no reason <span
id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611.md) , wisdom, power, will <span
id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md) , save the Son Who is the only
power of the Father, the immediate <span
id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) cause of the creation of the
universe: as perfect subsistence begotten of perfect subsistence in a
manner known to Himself, Who is and is named the Son. And the Holy
Spirit is the power of the Father revealing the hidden mysteries of His
Divinity, proceeding from the Father through the Son in a manner known
to Himself, but different from that of generation. Wherefore the Holy
Spirit is the perfecter of the creation of the universe. All the terms,
then, that are appropriate to the Father, as cause, source, begetter,
are to be ascribed to the Father alone: while those that are appropriate
to the caused, begotten Son, Word, immediate power, will, wisdom, are to
be ascribed to the Son: and those that are appropriate to the caused,
processional, manifesting, perfecting power, are to be ascribed to the
Holy Spirit. The Father is the source and cause of the Son and the Holy
Spirit: Father of the Son alone and producer of the Holy Spirit. The Son
is Son, Word, Wisdom, Power, Image, Effulgence, Impress of the Father
and derived from the Father. But the Holy Spirit is not the Son of the
Father but the Spirit of the Father as proceeding from the Father. For
there is no impulse without Spirit. And we speak also of the Spirit of
the Son, not as through proceeding from Him, but as proceeding through
Him from the Father. For the Father alone is cause.
