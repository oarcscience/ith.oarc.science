<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p3"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.i-p3.1"></span>Psalm I.</span>

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p4"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.i-p4.1"></span>The</span> primary condition of knowledge
for reading the Psalms is the ability to see as whose mouthpiece we are
to regard the Psalmist as speaking, and who it is that he addresses. For
they are not all of the same uniform character, but of different
authorship and different types. For we constantly find that the Person
of God the Father is being set before us, as in that passage of the
eighty-eighth Psalm: *I have exalted one chosen out of My people, I have
found David My servant, with My holy oil have I anointed him. He shall
call Me, Thou art my Father and the upholder of my salvation. And I will
make him My first-born, higher than the kings of the earth* <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[1359](#fn_1358.md) ; while in what we might call the
majority of Psalms the Person of the Son is introduced, as in the
seventeenth: *A people whom I have not known hath served Me* <span
id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359.md) ; and in the twenty-first: *they
parted My garments among them and cast lots upon My vesture* <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[1361](#fn_1360.md) . But the contents of the first
Psalm forbid us to understand it either of the Person of the Father or
of the Son: *But his will hath been in the law of the Lord, and in His
Law will he meditate day and night*. Now in the Psalm in which we said
the Person of the Father is intended, the terms used are exactly
appropriate, for instance: *He shall call Me, Thou art my Father, my God
and the upholder of my salvation;* and in that one in which we hear the
Son speaking, He proclaims Himself to be the author of the words by the
very expressions He employs, saying, *A people whom I have not known
hath served Me*. That is to say, when the Father on the one hand says:
*He shall call Me;* and the Son on the other hand says: *a people hath
served Me*, they shew that it is They Themselves Who are speaking
concerning Themselves. Here, however, where we have *But his will hath
been in the Law of the Lord;* obviously it is not the Person of the Lord
speaking concerning Himself, but the person of another, extolling the
happiness of that man whose will is in the Law of the Lord. Here, then,
we are to recognise the person of the Prophet by whose lips the Holy
Spirit speaks, raising us by the instrumentality of his lips to the
knowledge of a spiritual mystery.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p8"></span>2. And as he says this we must enquire
concerning what man we are to understand him to be speaking. He says:
*Happy is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly nor
stood in the way of sinners, and hath not sat in the seat of pestilence.
But his will hath been in the Law of the Lord, and in His Law will he
meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rills
of water, that will yield its fruit in its own season. His leaf also
shall not wither, and all things, whatsoever he shall do, shall
prosper.* I have discovered, either from personal conversation or from
their letters and writings, that the opinion of many men about this
Psalm is, that we ought to understand it to be a description of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and that it is His happiness which is extolled in the
verses following. But this interpretation is wrong both in method and
reasoning, though doubtless it is inspired by a pious tendency of
thought, since the whole of the Psalter is to be referred to Him: the
time and place in His life to which this passage refers must be
ascertained by the sound method of knowledge guided by reason.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p9"></span>3. Now the words which stand at the
beginning of the Psalm are quite unsuited to the Person and Dignity of
the Son, while the whole contents are in themselves a condemnation of
the careless haste that would use them to extol Him. For when it is
said, *and his will hath been in the Law of the Lord*, how (seeing that
the Law was given by the Son of God) can a happiness which depends on
his will being in the Law of the Lord be attributed to Him Who is
Himself Lord of the Law? That the Law is His He Himself declares in the
seventy-seventh Psalm, where He says: *Hear My Law, O My people: incline
your ears unto the words of My mouth. I will open My mouth in a
parable* <span id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361.md) . And the <span
id="page_237">p. 237</span> <span
id="ii.vi.ii.i-Page_237"></span>Evangelist Matthew further asserts that
these words were spoken by the Son, when he says *For this cause spake
He in parables that the saying might be fulfilled: I will open My mouth
in parables* <span id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362.md) . The Lord then
gave fulfilment in act to His own prophecy, speaking in the parables in
which He had promised that He would speak. But how can the sentence,
*and he shall be like a tree planted by the rills of water*,—wherein
growth in happiness is set forth in a figure—be possibly applied to His
Person, and a tree be said to be more happy than the Son of God, and the
cause of His happiness, which would be the case if an analogy were
established between Him and it in respect of growth towards happiness?
Again, since according to Wisdom <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363.md) and the Apostle, He is both before
the ages and before times eternal, and is the First-born of every
creature; and since in Him and through Him all things were created, how
can He be happy by becoming like objects created by Himself? For neither
does the power of the Creator need for its exaltation comparison with
any creature, nor does the immemorial age of the First-born allow of a
comparison involving unsuitable conditions of time, as would be the case
if He were compared to a tree. For that which shall be at some point of
future time cannot be looked upon as having either previously existed or
as now existing anywhere. But whatsoever already is does not need any
extension of time to begin existence, because it already possesses
continuous existence from the date of its beginning up till the present.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p13"></span>4. And so, since these words are
understood to be inapplicable to the divinity of the Only-begotten Son
of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, we must suppose him, who is here extolled
as happy by the Prophet, to be the man who strives to conform himself to
that body which the Lord assumed and in which He was born as man, by
zeal for justice and perfect fulfilment of all righteousness. That this
is the necessary interpretation will be shewn as the exposition of the
Psalm proceeds.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p14"></span>5. The Holy Spirit made choice of this
magnificent and noble introduction to the Psalter, in order to stir up
weak man to a pure zeal for piety by the hope of happiness, to teach him
the mystery of the Incarnate God, to promise him participation in
heavenly glory, to declare the penalty of the Judgment, to proclaim the
two-fold resurrection, to shew forth the counsel of God as seen in His
award. It is indeed after a faultless and mature design that He has laid
the foundation of this great prophecy <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364.md) ; His will being that the hope
connected with the happy man might allure weak humanity to zeal for the
Faith; that the analogy of the happiness of the tree might be the pledge
of a happy hope, that the declaration of His wrath against the ungodly
might set the bounds of fear to the excesses of ungodliness, that
difference in rank in the assemblies of the saints might mark difference
in merit, that the standard appointed for judging the ways of the
righteous might shew forth the majesty of God.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p16"></span>But let us now deal with the subject
matter and the words which express it.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p17"></span>6. *Happy is the man who hath not
walked in the counsel of the ungodly nor stood in the way of sinners,
and hath not sat in the seat of pestilence. But his will hath been in
the Law of the Lord, and in His Law will he meditate day and night.*

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p18"></span>The Prophet recites five kinds of
caution as continually present in the mind of the happy man: the first,
not to walk in the counsel of the ungodly, the second, not to stand in
the way of sinners, the third, not to sit in the seat of pestilence,
next, to set his will in the Law of the Lord, and lastly, to meditate
therein by day and by night. There must, therefore, be a distinction
between the ungodly and the sinner, between the sinner and the
pestilent; chiefly because here the ungodly has a counsel, the sinner a
way, the pestilent a seat, and again, because the question is of
walking, not standing, in the counsel of the ungodly; of standing, not
walking, in the way of the sinner. Now if we would understand the reason
of these facts, we must note the precise difference between the sinner
and the undutiful <span id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365.md) , that so
it may become clear why to the sinner is assigned a way, and to the
undutiful a counsel; next, why the question is of standing in the way,
and of walking in the counsel, whereas men are accustomed to connect
standing with a counsel, and walking with a way.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p20"></span>Not every man that is a sinner is also
undutiful: but the undutiful man cannot fail to be a sinner. Let us take
an instance from general experience. Sons, though they be drunken and
profligate and spendthrift, can yet love their fathers; and with all
these vices, and, therefore, not free from guilt, may yet be free from
undutifulness. But the undutiful, though they may be models of
continence and frugality, are, by the mere fact of despising the parent,
worse transgressors than if they were guilty of every sin that lies
outside the category of undutifulness.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p21"></span><span id="page_238">p. 238</span> <span
id="ii.vi.ii.i-Page_238"></span>7. There is no doubt then that, as this
instance proves, the undutiful (or ungodly) must be distinguished from
the sinner. And, indeed, general opinion agrees to call those men
ungodly who scorn to search for the knowledge of God, who in their
irreverent mind take for granted that there is no Creator of the world,
who assert that it arrived at the order and beauty which we see by
chance movements, who, in order to deprive their Creator of all power to
pass judgment on a life lived rightly or in sin, will have it that man
comes into being and passes out of it again by the simple operation of a
law of nature.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p22"></span>Thus, all the counsel of these men is
wavering, unsteady, and vague, and wanders about in the same familiar
paths and over the same familiar ground, never finding a resting-place,
for it fails to reach any definite decision. They have never in their
system risen to the doctrine of a Creator of the world, for instead of
answering our questions as to the cause, beginning, and duration of the
world, whether the world is for man, or man for the world, the reason of
death, its extent and nature, they press in ceaseless motion round the
circle of this godless argument and find no rest in these imaginings.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p23"></span>8. There are, besides, other counsels
of the ungodly, i.e., of those who have fallen into heresy, unrestrained
by the laws of either the New Testament or the Old. Their reasoning ever
takes the course of a vicious circle; without grasp or foothold to stay
them they tread their interminable round of endless indecision. Their
ungodliness consists in measuring God, not by His own revelation, but by
a standard of their choosing; they forget that it is as godless to make
a God as to deny Him; if you ask them what effect these opinions have on
their faith and hope, they are perplexed and confused, they wander from
the point and wilfully avoid the real issue of the debate. Happy is the
man then who hath not walked in this kind of counsel of the ungodly,
nay, who has not even entertained the wish to walk therein, for it is a
sin even to think for a moment of things that are ungodly.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p24"></span>9. The next condition is, that the man
who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly shall not stand in the
way of sinners. For there are many whose confession concerning God,
while it acquits them of ungodliness, yet does not set them free from
sin; those, for example, who abide in the Church but do not observe her
laws; such are the greedy, the drunken, the brawlers, the wanton, the
proud, hypocrites, liars, plunderers. No doubt we are urged towards
these sins by the promptings of our natural instincts; but it is good
for us to withdraw from the path into which we are being hurried and not
to stand therein, seeing that we are offered so easy a way of escape. It
is for this reason that the man who has not stood in the way of sinners
is happy, for while nature carries him into that way, religious belief
draws him back.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p25"></span>10. Now the third condition for gaining
happiness is not to sit in the seat of pestilence. The Pharisees sat as
teachers in Moses’ seat, and Pilate sat in the seat of judgment: of what
seat then are we to consider the occupation pestilential? Not surely of
that of Moses, for it is the occupants of the seat and not the
occupation of it that the Lord condemns when He says: *The Scribes and
Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat; whatsoever they bid you do, that do; but
do not ye after their work* <span id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366.md) .
The occupation of that seat is not pestilential, to which obedience is
enjoined by the Lord’s own word. That then must be really pestilential,
the infection of which Pilate sought to avoid by washing his hands. For
many, even God-fearing men, are led astray by the canvassing for worldly
honours; and desire to administer the law of the courts, though they are
bound by those of the Church.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p27"></span>But although they bring to the
discharge of their duties a religious intention, as is shewn by their
merciful and upright demeanour, still they cannot escape a certain
contagious infection arising from the business in which their life is
spent. For the conduct of civil cases does not suffer them to be true to
the holy principles of the Church’s law, even though they wish it. And
without abandoning their pious purpose they are compelled, against their
will, by the necessary conditions of the seat they have won, to use, at
one time invective, at another, insult, at another, punishment; and
their very position makes them authors as well as victims of the
necessity which constrains them, their system being as it were
impregnated with the infection. Hence this title, *the seat of
pestilence*, by which the Prophet describes their seat, because by its
infection it poisons the very will of the religiously minded.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p28"></span>11. But the fact that he has not walked
in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat
in the seat of pestilence, does not constitute the perfection of the
man’s happiness. For the belief that one God is the Creator of the
world, the avoidance of sin by the pursuit of unassuming goodness, the
preference of the tranquil leisure of private life to the grandeur of
public position—all this may be found even in a pagan. But here <span
id="page_239">p. 239</span> <span id="ii.vi.ii.i-Page_239"></span>the
Prophet, in portraying in the likeness of God the man that is
perfect—one who may serve as a noble example of eternal happiness—points
to the exercise by him of no commonplace virtues, and to the words, *But
his will hath been in the Law of the Lord*, for the attainment of
perfect happiness. To refrain from what has gone before is useless
unless his mind be set on what follows, *But his will hath been in the
Law of the Lord*. The Prophet does not look for fear. The majority of
men are kept within the bounds of Law by fear; the few are brought under
the Law by will: for it is the mark of fear not to dare to omit what it
is afraid of, but of perfect piety to be ready to obey commands. This is
why that man is happy whose will, not whose fear, is in the Law of God.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p29"></span>12. But then sometimes the will needs
supplementing; and the mere desire for perfect happiness does not win
it, unless performance wait upon intention. The Psalm, you remember,
goes on: *And in His Law will he meditate day and night*. The man
achieves the perfection of happiness by unbroken and unwearied
meditation in the Law. Now it may be objected that this is impossible
owing to the conditions of human infirmity, which require time for
repose, for sleep, for food: so that our bodily circumstances preclude
us from the hope of attaining happiness, inasmuch as we are distracted
by the interruption of our bodily needs from our meditation by day and
night. Parallel to this passage are the words of the Apostle, *Pray
without ceasing* <span id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367.md) . As though
we were bound to set at naught our bodily requirements and to continue
praying without any interruption! Meditation in the Law, therefore, does
not lie in reading its words, but in pious performance of its
injunctions; not in a mere perusal of the books and writings, but in a
practical meditation and exercise in their respective contents, and in a
fulfilment of the Law by the works we do by night and day, as the
Apostle says: *Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to
the glory of God* <span id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368.md) . The way
to secure uninterrupted prayer is for every devout man to make his life
one long prayer by works acceptable to God and always done to His glory:
thus a life lived according to the Law by night and day will in itself
become a nightly and daily meditation in the Law.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p32"></span>13. But now that the man has found
perfect happiness by keeping aloof from the counsel of the ungodly and
the way of sinners and the seat of pestilence, and by gladly meditating
in the Law of God by day and by night, we are next to be shewn the rich
fruit that this happiness he has won will yield him. Now the
anticipation of happiness contains the germ of future happiness. For the
next verse runs: *And he shall be like a tree planted beside the rills
of water, which shall yield its fruit in its own season, whose leaf also
shall not fall off*. This may perhaps be deemed an absurd and
inappropriate comparison, in which are extolled a planted tree, rills of
water, the yielding of fruit, its own time, and the leaf that falls not.
All this may appear trivial enough to the judgment of the world. But let
us examine the teaching of the Prophet and see the beauty that lies in
the objects and words used to illustrate happiness.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p33"></span>14. In the book of Genesis <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369.md) , where the lawgiver depicts the
paradise planted by God, we are shewn that every tree is fair to look
upon and good for food; it is also stated that there stands in the midst
of the garden a tree of Life and a tree of the knowledge of good and
evil; next that the garden is watered by a stream that afterwards
divides into four heads. The Prophet Solomon teaches us what this tree
of Life is in his exhortation concerning Wisdom: *She is a tree of life
to all them that lay hold upon her, and lean upon her* <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370.md) . This tree then is living; and not
only living, but, furthermore, guided by reason; guided by reason, that
is, in so far as to yield fruit, and that not casually nor unseasonably,
but in its own season. And this tree is planted beside the rills of
water in the domain of the Kingdom of God, that is, of course, in
Paradise, and in the place where the stream as it issues forth is
divided into four heads. For he does not say, *Behind the rills of
water*, but, *Beside the rills of water*, at the place where first the
heads receive each their flow of waters. This tree is planted in that
place whither the Lord, Who is Wisdom, leads the thief who confessed Him
to be the Lord, saying: *Verily I say unto thee, to-day shalt thou be
with Me in Paradise* <span id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371.md) . And
now that we have shewn upon prophetic warrant that Wisdom, which is
Christ, is called the tree of Life in accordance with the mystery of the
coming Incarnation and Passion, we must go on to find support for the
strict truth of this interpretation from the Gospels. The Lord with His
own lips compared Himself to a tree when the Jews said that He cast out
devils in Beelzebub: *Either make the tree good*, said He, *and its
fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; for
the tree is known by its fruit* <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372.md) ; because although to cast out
devils is an excellent fruit, they said He was Beelzebab, <span
id="page_240">p. 240</span> <span id="ii.vi.ii.i-Page_240"></span>whose
fruits are abominable. Nor yet did He hesitate to teach that the power
that makes the tree happy resided in His Person, when on the way to the
Cross He said: *For if they do these things in the green tree, what
shall be done in the dry* <span id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373.md) *?*
Declaring by this image of the green tree that there was nothing in Him
that was subject to the dryness of death.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p39"></span>15. That happy man, then, will become
like unto this tree when he shall be transplanted, as the thief was,
into the garden and set to grow beside the rills of water: and his
planting will be that happy new planting which cannot be uprooted, to
which the Lord refers in the Gospels when He curses the other kind of
planting and says: *Every planting that My Father hath not planted shall
be rooted up* <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374.md) . This tree,
therefore, will yield its fruits. Now in all other passages where God’s
Word teaches some lesson from the fruits of trees, it mentions them as
making fruit rather than as yielding fruit, as when it says: *A good
tree cannot make evil fruits* <span id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375.md)
, and when in Isaiah the complaint about the vine is: *I looked that it
should make grapes, and it made thorns* <span
id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376.md) . But this tree will yield its
fruits, being supplied with free-will and understanding for the purpose.
For it will yield its fruits in its own season. And, pray, in what
season? In the season, of course, of which the Apostle speaks: *That He
might make known unto you also the mystery of His Will, according to His
good pleasure which He hath purposed in Himself, in the dispensation of
the fulness of time* <span id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377.md) . This,
then, is the dispensation of time, by which is regulated the right
moment of receiving, in the case of the recipients, and of giving, in
that of the giver; for the giver has choice of the season. But delay in
point of time depends upon the fulness of times. For the dispensation of
yielding fruit waits upon the fulness of time. Now what, you ask, is
this fruit that is to be dispensed? That assuredly of which this same
Apostle is speaking when he says: *And He will change our vile body,
that it may be fashioned like His glorious body* <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md) . Thus He will give us those fruits
of His which He has already brought to perfection in that man whom He
has chosen to Himself who is portrayed under the image of a tree, whose
mortality He has utterly done away and has raised him to share in His
own immortality.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p45"></span>This man then will be happy like that
tree, when at length he stands surrounded by the glory of God, being
made like unto the Lord.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p46"></span>16. *But the leaf of this tree shall
not fall off*. There is no ground for wonder that its leaves do not fall
off, seeing that its fruits will not drop to the ground, either because
they are forced off by ripeness, or shaken off by external violence, but
it will yield them, distributing them by an act of reasoned service. Now
the spiritual significance of the leaves is made clear by a comparison
based upon material objects. We see that leaves are made to sprout round
the fruits about which they cluster, for the express purpose of
protecting them, and of forming a kind of fence to the young and tender
shoots. What the leaves signify, then, is the teaching of God’s words in
which the promised fruits are clothed. For it is these words that kindly
shade our hopes, that shield and protect them from the rough winds of
this world. These leaves, then, that is the words of God, shall not
fall: for the Lord Himself has said: *Heaven and earth shall pass away,
but My words shall not pass away* <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379.md) , for of the words that have been
spoken by God not one shall fail or fall.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p48"></span>17. Now that the leaves of the tree we
speak of are not valueless but are a source of health to the nations is
testified by St. John in the Apocalypse, where he says: *And He shewed
me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the
throne of God and of the Lamb; in the midst of the street of it and on
either side of the river the tree of life, bearing twelve manner of
fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree are
for the healing the nations* <span id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380.md)
.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p50"></span>Bodily manifestations so reveal the
mysteries of heaven that, although matter by itself cannot convey the
full spiritual meaning, yet to regard them only in their material aspect
is to mutilate them. We should have expected to hear that there were
trees, not one tree, standing on either side of the river shewn to the
saint. But because the tree of Life in the sacrament of Baptism is in
every case one, supplying to those that come to it on every side the
fruits of the apostolic message, so there stands on either side of the
river one tree of Life. There is one Lamb seen amid the throne of God,
and one river, and one tree of Life: three figures wherein are comprised
the mysteries of the Incarnation, Baptism and Passion, whose leaves,
that is to say, the words of the Gospel, bring healing to the nations
through the teaching of a message that cannot fall to the ground.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p51"></span>18. *And all things whatsoever he doeth
shall prosper*. Never again shall His gift and His statutes be set at
naught, as they were in the case of Adam, who by his sin in breaking the
<span id="page_241">p. 241</span> <span
id="ii.vi.ii.i-Page_241"></span>Law lost the happiness of an assured
immortality; but now, thanks to the redemption wrought by the tree of
Life, that is, by the Passion of the Lord, all that happens to us is
eternal and eternally conscious of happiness in virtue of our future
likeness to that tree of Life. For all their doings shall prosper, being
wrought no longer amid shift and change nor in human weakness, for
corruption will be swallowed up in incorruption, weakness in endless
life, the form of earthly flesh in the form of God. This tree, then,
planted and yielding its fruit in its own season, shall that happy man
resemble, himself being planted in the Garden, that what God has planted
may abide, never to be rooted up, in the Garden where all things done by
God shall be guided to a prosperous issue, apart from the decay that
belongs to human weakness and to time, and has to be uprooted.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p52"></span>19. The next point after the prophet
had set forth the man’s perfect happiness was for him to declare what
punishment remained for the ungodly. Thus there ensues: *The ungodly are
not so, but are like the dust which the wind driveth away from the face
of the earth*. The ungodly have no possible hope of having the image of
the happy tree applied to them; the only lot that awaits them is one of
wandering and winnowing, crushing, dispersion and unrest; shaken out of
the solid framework of their bodily condition, they must be swept away
to punishment in dust, a plaything of the wind. They shall not be
dissolved into nothing, for punishment must find in them some stuff to
work on, but ground into particles, imponderable, unsubstantial, dry,
they shall be tossed to and fro, and make sport for the punishment that
gives them never rest. Their punishment is recorded by the same Prophet
in another place where he says: *I will beat them small as the dust
before the wind, like the mire of the streets I will destroy them* <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381.md) .

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p54"></span>Thus as there is an appointed type for
happiness, so is there one for punishment. For as it is no hard task for
the wind to scatter the dust, and as men who walk through the mud of the
streets are hardly aware that they have been treading on it, so it is
easy for the punishment of hell to destroy and disperse the ungodly, the
logical result of whose sins is to melt them into mud and crush them
into dust, reft of all solid substance, for dust and mud they are, and
being merely mud and dust are good for nothing else than punishment.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p55"></span>20. And the Prophet, seeing that the
change of their solid substance into dust will deprive them of all share
in the boon of fruit to be bestowed upon the happy man in season by the
tree, has accordingly added: *Therefore the ungodly shall not rise again
in the Judgment*. The fact that they shall not rise again does not
convey sentence of annihilation upon these men, for indeed they will
exist as dust; it is the resurrection to Judgment that is denied them.
Non-existence will not enable them to miss the pain of punishment; for
while that which will be non-existent would escape punishment, they, on
the other hand, will exist to be punished, for they will be dust. Now to
become dust, whether by being dried to dust or ground to dust, involves
not loss of the state of existence, but a change of state. But the fact
that they will not rise again to Judgment makes it clear that they have
lost, not the power to rise, but the privilege of rising to Judgment.
Now what we are to understand by the privilege of rising again and being
judged is declared by the Lord in the Gospels where He says: *He that
believeth on Me is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged
already. And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the
world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light* <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md) .

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p57"></span>21. The terms of this utterance of the
Lord are disturbing to inattentive hearers and careless, hasty readers.
For by saying: *He that believeth on Me shall not be judged*, He exempts
believers, and by adding: *But he that believeth not hath been judged
already*, He excludes unbelievers, from judgment. If, then, He has thus
exempted believers and debarred unbelievers, allowing the chance of
judgment neither to one class nor the other, how can He be considered
consistent when he adds thirdly: *And this is the judgment, that the
light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the
light?* For there can apparently be no place left for judgment, since
neither believers nor unbelievers are to be judged. Such no doubt will
be the conclusion drawn by inattentive hearers and hasty readers. The
utterance, however, has an appropriate meaning and a rational
interpretation of its own.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p58"></span>22. He that believes, says Christ, is
not judged. And is there any need to judge a believer? Judgment arises
out of ambiguity, and where ambiguity ceases, there is no call for trial
and judgment. Hence not even unbelievers need be judged, because there
is no doubt about their being unbelievers; but after exempting believers
and unbelievers alike from judgment, the Lord added a case for judgment
and human agents upon whom it must be <span id="page_242">p. 242</span>
<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-Page_242"></span>exercised. For some there are who
stand midway between the godly and the ungodly, having affinities to
both, but strictly belonging to neither class, because they have come to
be what they are by a combination of the two. They may not be assigned
to the ranks of belief, because there is in them a certain infusion of
unbelief; they may not be ranged with unbelief, because they are not
without a certain portion of belief. For many are kept within the pale
of the church by the fear of God; yet they are tempted all the while to
worldly faults by the allurements of the world. They pray, because they
are afraid; they sin, because it is their will. The fair hope of future
life makes them call themselves Christians; the allurements of present
pleasure make them act like heathen. They do not abide in ungodliness,
because they hold the name of God in honour; they are not godly because
they follow after things contrary to godliness. And they cannot help
loving those things best which can never enable them to be what they
call themselves, because their desire to do such works is stronger than
their desire to be true to their name. And this is why the Lord, after
saying that believers would not be judged and that unbelievers had been
judged already, added that *This is the judgment, that the light is come
into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light.*

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p59"></span>These, then, are they whom the judgment
awaits which unbelievers have already had passed upon them and believers
do not need: because they have loved darkness more than light; not that
they did not love the light too, but because their love of darkness is
the more active. For when two loves are matched in rivalry, one always
wins the preference; and their judgment arises from the fact that,
though they loved Christ, they yet loved darkness more. These then will
be judged; they are neither exempted from judgment like the godly, nor
have they already been judged like the ungodly; but judgment awaits them
for the love which they have deliberately preferred.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p60"></span>23. It is precisely the scheme and
system thus laid down in the Gospel that the Prophet has followed, when
he says: *Therefore the ungodly shall not rise again in the Judgement,
nor sinners in the counsel of the righteous*. He leaves no judgment for
the ungodly, because they have been judged already; on the other hand,
he has refused to sinners, who as we shewed in our former
discourse <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383.md) are to be
distinguished from the ungodly, the counsel of the righteous, because
they are to be judged. For ungodliness causes the former to be judged
beforehand, but sin keeps the latter to be judged hereafter. Thus
ungodliness having already been judged is not admitted to the judgment
of sinners, while again sinners, who, are yet to be judged, are deemed
unworthy of enjoying the counsel of the righteous, who will not be
judged.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p62"></span>24. The source of this distinction lies
in the following words: *For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous,
but the way of the ungodly shall perish*. Sinners do not come near the
counsel of the righteous for this reason, that the Lord knows the way of
the righteous. Now He knows, not by an advance from ignorance to
knowledge, but because He condescends to know. For there is no play of
human emotions in God that He should know or not know anything. The
blessed Apostle Paul declared how we were known of God when he said: *If
any man among you is a prophet or spiritual, let him take knowledge of
the things which I write unto you, that they are of the Lord: but if any
man does not know, he is not known* <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384.md) .

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p64"></span>Thus he shews that those are known of
God who know the things of God: they are to come to be known when they
know, that is, when they attain to the honour of being known through the
merit of their known godliness, in order that the knowledge may be seen
to be a growth on the part of him who is known, and not a growth on the
part of one who knows not.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p65"></span>Now God shews clearly in the cases of
Adam and Abraham that He does not know sinners, but does know believers.
For it was said to Adam when he had sinned: *Adam, where art thou* <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385.md) *?* Not because God knew not that
the man whom He still had in the garden was there still, but to shew, by
his being asked where he was, that he was unworthy of God’s knowledge by
the fact of having sinned. But Abraham, after being for a long time
unknown—the word of God came to him when he was seventy years of
age—was, upon his proving himself faithful to the Lord, admitted to
intimacy with God by the following act of high condescension: *Now I
know that thou fearest the Lord thy God, and for My sake thou hast not
spared thy dearly loved son* <span id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386.md)
.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.i-p68"></span>God certainly was not ignorant of the
faith of Abraham, which He had already reckoned to him for righteousness
when he believed about the birth of Isaac: but now because he had given
a signal instance of his fear in offering his son, he is at last known,
approved, rendered worthy of being not unknown. It is <span
id="page_243">p. 243</span> <span id="ii.vi.ii.i-Page_243"></span>in
this way then that God both knows and knows not—Adam the sinner is not
known, and Abraham the faithful is known, is worthy, that is, of being
known by God Who surely knows all things. The way of the righteous,
therefore, who are not to be judged is known by God: and this is why
sinners, who are to be judged, are set far from their counsel; while the
ungodly shall not rise again to judgment, because their way has
perished, and they have already been judged by Him Who said: *The Father
judgeth no man*, but hath given all judgment unto the Son, our Lord
Jesus Christ, Who is blessed for ever and ever. Amen.
