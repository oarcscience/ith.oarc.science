<span id="iii.iv.iv.iii-p1"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*In reply to those
who say* <span id="fr_2255"></span>[2256](#fn_2255.md) *“If Christ has two
natures, either ye do service to the creature in worshipping created
nature, or ye say that there is one nature to be worshipped, and another
not to be worshipped.”*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.iii-p3"></span>Along with the Father and the Holy
Spirit we worship the Son of God, Who was incorporeal before He took on
humanity, and now in His own person is incarnate and has become man
though still being also God. His flesh, then, in its own nature <span
id="fr_2256"></span>[2257](#fn_2256.md) , if one were to make subtle mental
distinctions between what is seen and what is thought, is not deserving
of worship since it is created. But as it is united with God the Word,
it is worshipped on account of Him and in Him. For just as the king
deserves homage alike when un-robed and when robed, and just as the
purple robe, considered simply as a purple robe, is trampled upon and
tossed about, but after becoming the royal dress receives all honour and
glory, and whoever dishonours it is generally condemned to death: and
again, just as wood in itself <span id="fr_2257"></span>[2258](#fn_2257.md)
is not of such a nature that it cannot be touched, but becomes so when
fire is applied to it, and it becomes charcoal, and yet this is not
because of its own nature, but because of the fire united to it, and the
nature of the wood is not such as cannot be touched, but rather the
charcoal or burning wood: so also the flesh, in its own nature, is not
to be worshipped, but is worshipped in the incarnate God Word, not
because of itself, but because of its union in subsistence with God the
Word. And we do not say that <span id="page_75b">p. 75b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.iii-Page_75b"></span>we worship mere flesh, but God’s
flesh, that is, God incarnate.
