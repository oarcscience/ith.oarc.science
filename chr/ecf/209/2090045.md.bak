<span id="iii.iv.i.ix-p1"></span> <span id="page_12b">p. 12b</span>
<span id="iii.iv.i.ix-Page_12b"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*Concerning what is
affirmed about God.*

<span id="iii.iv.i.ix-p2"></span>The Deity is simple and uncompound. But
that which is composed of many and different elements is compound. If,
then, we should speak of the qualities of being uncreate and without
beginning and incorporeal and immortal and everlasting and good and
creative and so forth as essential differences in the case of God, that
which is composed of so many qualities will not be simple but must be
compound. But this is impious in the extreme. Each then of the
affirmations about God should be thought of as signifying not what He is
in essence, but either something that it is impossible to make plain, or
some relation to some of those things which are contrasts or some of
those things that follow the nature, or an energy <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.ix-p4"></span>It appears then <span
id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md) that the most proper of all the
names given to God is “He that is,” as He Himself said in answer to
Moses on the mountain, *Say to the sons of Israel, He that is hath sent
Me* <span id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md) . For He keeps all being
in His own embrace <span id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581.md) , like a
sea of essence infinite and unseen. Or as the holy Dionysius says, “He
that is good <span id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582.md) .” For one
cannot say of God that He has being in the first place and goodness in
the second.

<span id="iii.iv.i.ix-p9"></span>The second name of God is <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.ix-p9.1"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.ix-p9.2"></span>Θεός</span>, derived
from <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.ix-p9.3"></span>θέειν</span> <span
id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583.md) , to run, because He courses
through all things, or from <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.ix-p10.2"></span>αἴθειν</span>, to burn: *For God is a fire
consuming all evil* <span id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584.md) : or from
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.ix-p11.2"></span>θεᾶσθαι</span>,
because He is all-seeing <span id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585.md) :
for nothing can escape Him, and over all He keepeth watch. For He saw
all things before they were, holding them timelessly in His thoughts;
and each one conformably to His voluntary and timeless thought <span
id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586.md) , which constitutes
predetermination and image and pattern, comes into existence at the
predetermined time <span id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.ix-p15"></span>The first name then conveys the notion
of His existence and of the nature of His existence: while the second
contains the idea of energy. Further, the terms ‘without beginning,’
‘incorruptible,’ ‘unbegotten,’ as also ‘uncreate,’ ‘incorporeal,’
‘unseen,’ and so forth, explain what He is not: that is to say, they
tell us that His being had no beginning, that He is not corruptible, nor
created, nor corporeal, nor visible <span
id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588.md) . Again, goodness and justice and
piety and such like names belong to the nature <span
id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589.md) , but do not explain His actual
essence. Finally, Lord and King and names of that class indicate a
relationship with their contrasts: for the name Lord has reference to
those over whom the lord rules, and the name King to those under kingly
authority, and the name Creator to the creatures, and the name Shepherd
to the sheep he tends.
