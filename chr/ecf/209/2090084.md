<span id="iii.iv.iii.ii-p1"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.</span> —*Concerning the
manner in which the Word* <span id="fr_1941"></span>[1942](#fn_1941)
*was conceived, and concerning His divine incarnation.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.ii-p3"></span>The angel of the Lord was sent to the
holy Virgin, who was descended from David’s line <span
id="fr_1942"></span>[1943](#fn_1942) . *For it is evident that our Lord
sprang out of Judah, of which tribe no one turned his attention to the
altar* <span id="fr_1943"></span>[1944](#fn_1943) , as the divine
apostle said: but about this we will speak more accurately later. And
bearing glad tidings to her, he said, *Hail thou highly favoured one,
the Lord is with thee* <span id="fr_1944"></span>[1945](#fn_1944) . And
she was troubled at his word, and the angel said to her, *Fear not,
Mary, for thou hast found favour with God, and shalt bring forth a Son
and shalt call His name Jesus* <span
id="fr_1945"></span>[1946](#fn_1945) ; for He shall save His people from
their sins <span id="fr_1946"></span>[1947](#fn_1946) . Hence it comes
that Jesus has the interpretation Saviour. And when she asked in her
perplexity, *How can this be, seeing I know not a man* <span
id="fr_1947"></span>[1948](#fn_1947) ? the angel again answered her,
*The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest
shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be
born of thee* <span id="fr_1948"></span>[1949](#fn_1948) *shall be
called the Son of God* <span id="fr_1949"></span>[1950](#fn_1949) . And
she said to him, *Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it unto me
according to Thy word* <span id="fr_1950"></span>[1951](#fn_1950) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.ii-p13"></span>So then, after the assent of the
holy Virgin, the Holy Spirit descended on her, according to the word of
the Lord which the angel spoke, purifying her <span
id="fr_1951"></span>[1952](#fn_1951) , and granting her power to receive
the divinity of the Word, and likewise power to bring forth <span
id="fr_1952"></span>[1953](#fn_1952) . And then was she
overshadowed <span id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953) by the
enhypostatic Wisdom and Power of the most high God, the Son of God Who
is of like essence with the Father as of Divine seed, and from her holy
and most pure blood He formed flesh animated with the spirit of reason
and thought, the first-fruits of our compound nature <span
id="fr_1954"></span>[1955](#fn_1954) : not by procreation but by
creation through the Holy Spirit: not developing the fashion of the body
by gradual additions but perfecting it at once, He Himself, the very
Word of God, standing to the flesh in the relation of subsistence. For
the divine Word was not made one with flesh that had an independent
pre-existence <span id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955) , but taking up
His abode in the womb of the holy Virgin, He unreservedly in His own
subsistence took upon Himself through the pure blood of the eternal
Virgin a body of flesh animated with the spirit of reason and thought,
thus assuming to Himself the first-fruits of man’s compound nature,
Himself, the Word, having become a subsistence in the flesh. So
that <span id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956) He is at once flesh, and
at the same time flesh of God the Word, and likewise flesh animated,
possessing both reason and thought <span
id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957) . Wherefore we speak not of man as
having become God, but of God as having become Man <span
id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958) . For being by nature perfect God,
He naturally became likewise perfect Man: and did not change His nature
nor make the dispensation <span id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959) an
empty show, but became, without confusion or change or division, one in
subsistence with the flesh, which was conceived of the holy Virgin, and
animated with reason and thought, and had found existence in Him, while
He did not change the nature of His divinity into the essence of flesh,
nor the essence of flesh into the nature of His divinity, and did not
make one compound nature out of His divine nature and the human nature
He had assumed <span id="fr_1960"></span>[1961](#fn_1960) .
