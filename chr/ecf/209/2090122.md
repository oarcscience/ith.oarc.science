<span id="iii.iv.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*Concerning Faith.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.x-p2"></span>Moreover, faith is twofold. For *faith
cometh by hearing*. <span id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339) For by
hearing the divine Scriptures we believe in the teaching of the Holy
Spirit. The same is perfected by all the things enjoined by Christ,
believing in work, cultivating piety, and doing the commands of Him Who
restored us. For he that believeth not according to the tradition of the
Catholic Church, or who hath intercourse with the devil through strange
works, is an unbeliever.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.x-p4"></span>But again, *faith is the substance of
things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen* <span
id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340) , or undoubting and unambiguous
hope alike of what God hath promised us and of the good issue of our
prayers. The first, therefore, belongs to our will, while the second is
of the gifts of the Spirit.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.x-p6"></span>Further, observe that by baptism we
cut <span id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341) off all the covering
which we have worn since birth, that is to say, sin, and become
spiritual Israelites and God’s people.
