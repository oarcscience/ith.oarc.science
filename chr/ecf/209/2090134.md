<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*Concerning the law
of God and the law of sin.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxii-p2"></span>The Deity is good and more than
good, and so is His will. For that which God wishes is good. Moreover
the precept, which teaches this, is law, that we, holding by it, may
walk in light <span id="fr_2631"></span>[2632](#fn_2631) : and the
transgression of this precept is sin, and this continues to exist on
account of the assault of the devil and our unconstrained and voluntary
reception of it <span id="fr_2632"></span>[2633](#fn_2632) . And this,
too, is called law <span id="fr_2633"></span>[2634](#fn_2633) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxii-p6"></span>And so the law of God, settling in
our mind, draws it towards itself and pricks our conscience. And our
conscience, too, is called a law of our mind. Further, the assault of
the wicked one, that is the law of sin, settling in the members of our
flesh, makes its assault upon us through it. For by once voluntarily
transgressing the law of God and receiving the assault of the wicked
one, we gave entrance to it, being sold by ourselves to sin. Wherefore
our body is readily impelled to it. And so the savour and perception of
sin that is stored up in our body, that is to say, lust and pleasure of
the body, is law in the members of our flesh.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxii-p7"></span>Therefore the law of my mind, that
is, the conscience, sympathises with the law of God, that is, the
precept, and makes that its will. But the law of sin <span
id="fr_2634"></span>[2635](#fn_2634) , that is to say, the assault <span
id="page_95b">p. 95b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxii-Page_95b"></span>made through the law that is in our
members, or through the lust and inclination and movement of the body
and of the irrational part of the soul, is in opposition to the law of
my mind, that is to conscience, and takes me captive (even though I make
the law of God my will and set my love on it, and make not sin my will),
by reason of commixture <span id="fr_2635"></span>[2636](#fn_2635) : and
through the softness of pleasure and the lust of the body and of the
irrational part of the soul, as I said, it leads me astray and induces
me to become the servant of sin. But *what the law could not do, in that
it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness
of sinful flesh* (for He assumed flesh but not sin) *condemned sin in
the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us
who walk not after the flesh but in the Spirit* <span
id="fr_2636"></span>[2637](#fn_2636) . *For the Spirit helpeth our
infirmities* <span id="fr_2637"></span>[2638](#fn_2637) and affordeth
power to the law of our mind, against the law that is in our members.
For the verse, *we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the
Spirit itself maketh intercession with groanings that cannot be
uttered* <span id="fr_2638"></span>[2639](#fn_2638) , itself teacheth us
what to pray for. Hence it is impossible to carry out the precepts of
the Lord except by patience and prayer.

‘contractionem, refusionem per laevitatem voluptatis:’ Faber has
‘secundum contradictionem per suadelam voluptatis.’ The author’s meaning
is that owing to the conjunction of mind with body, the law of sin is
mixed with all the members.
