<span id="iii.iv.ii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*Concerning air and
winds.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.viii-p2"></span>Air is the most subtle element, and
is moist and warm: heavier, indeed, than fire: but lighter than earth
and water: it is the cause of respiration and voice: it is colourless,
that is, it has no colour by nature: it is clear and transparent, for it
is capable of receiving light: it ministers to three of our senses, for
it is by its aid that we see, hear and smell: it has the power likewise
of receiving heat and cold, dryness and moisture, and its movements in
space are up, down, within, without, to the right and to the left, and
the cyclical movement.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.viii-p3"></span>It does not derive its light from
itself, but is illuminated by sun, and moon, and stars, and fire. And
this is just what the Scripture means when it says, *And darkness was
upon the deep* <span id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737) ; for its
object is to shew that the air has not derived its light from itself,
but that it is quite a different essence from light.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.viii-p5"></span>And wind is a movement of air: or
wind is a rush of air which changes its name as it changes the place
whence it rushes <span id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.viii-p7"></span>Its place is in the air. For place
is the circumference of a body. But what is it that surrounds bodies but
air? There are, moreover, different places in which the movement of air
originates, and from these the winds get their names. There are in all
twelve winds. It is said that air is just fire after it has been
extinguished, or the vapour of heated water. At all events, in its own
special nature the air is warm, but it becomes cold owing to the
proximity of water and earth, so that the lower parts of it are cold,
and the higher warm <span id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.viii-p9"></span>These then are the winds <span
id="fr_1740"></span>[1741](#fn_1740) : Cæcias, or Meses, arises in the
region where the sun rises in summer. Subsolanus, where the sun rises at
the equinoxes. Eurus, where it rises in winter. Africus, where it sets
in winter. Favonius, where it sets at the equinoxes, and Corus, or
Olympias, or Iapyx, where it sets in summer. Then come Auster and
Aquilo, whose blasts oppose one another. Between Aquilo and Cæcias comes
Boreas: and between Eurus and Auster, Phœnix or Euronotus; between
Auster and Africus, Libonotus or Leuconotus: and lastly, between Aquilo
and Corus, Thrascias, or Cercius, as it is called by the inhabitants of
that region.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.viii-p11"></span>\[These <span
id="fr_1741"></span>[1742](#fn_1741) , then, are the races which dwell
at the ends of the world: beside Subsolanus are the Bactriani: beside
Eurus, the Indians: beside Phœnix, the Red Sea and Ethiopia: beside
Libonotus, the Garamantes, who are beyond Systis: beside Africus, the
Ethiopians and the Western Mauri: beside Favonius, the columns of
Hercules and the beginnings of Libya and Europe: beside Corus, Iberia,
which is now called Spain: beside Thrascia, the Gauls and the
neighbouring nations: beside Aquilo, the Scythians who are beyond
Thrace: beside Boreas, Pontus, Mæotis and the Sarmatæ: beside Cæcias,
the Caspian Sea and the Sacai.\]
