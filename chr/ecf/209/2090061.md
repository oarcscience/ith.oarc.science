<span id="iii.iv.ii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*Concerning earth and its
products.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.x-p2"></span>The earth is one of the four elements,
dry, cold, heavy, motionless, brought into being by God, out of nothing
on the first day. *For in the beginning*, he said, *God created the
heaven and the earth* <span id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756) : but
the seat and foundation of the earth no man has been able to declare.
Some, indeed, hold that its seat is the waters: thus the divine David
says, *To Him Who established the earth on the waters* <span
id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757) . Others place it in the air. Again
some other says, *He Who hangeth the earth on nothing* <span
id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758) . And, again, David, the singer of
God, says, as though the representative of God, *I bear up the pillars
of it* <span id="fr_1759"></span>[1760](#fn_1759) , meaning by “pillars”
the force that sustains it. Further, the expression, *He hath founded it
upon the seas* <span id="fr_1760"></span>[1761](#fn_1760) , shews
clearly that the earth is on all hands surrounded with water. But
whether we grant that it is established on itself, or on air or on
water, or on nothing, we must not turn aside from reverent thought, but
must admit that all things are sustained and preserved by the power of
the Creator.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.x-p8"></span>In the beginning, then, as the Holy
Scripture says <span id="fr_1761"></span>[1762](#fn_1761) , it was
hidden beneath the waters, and was unwrought, that is to say, not
beautified. But at God’s bidding, places to hold the waters appeared,
and then the mountains came into existence, and at the divine command
the earth received its own proper adornment, and was dressed in all
manner of herbs and plants, and on these, by the divine decree, was
bestowed the power of growth and nourishment, and of producing seed to
generate their like. Moreover, at the bidding of the Creator it produced
also all manner of kinds of living creatures, creeping things, and wild
beasts, and cattle. All, indeed, are for the seasonable use of man: but
of them some are for food, such as stags, sheep, deer, and such like:
others for service such as camels, oxen, horses, asses, and such like:
and others for enjoyment, such as apes, and among birds, jays and
parrots, and such like. Again, amongst plants and herbs some are fruit
bearing, others edible, others fragrant and flowery, given to us for our
enjoyment, for example, the rose and such like, and others for the
healing of disease. For there is not a single animal or plant in which
the Creator has not implanted some form of energy capable of being used
to satisfy man’s needs. For He Who knew all things before they were, saw
that in the future man would go forward in the strength of his own will,
and would be subject to corruption, and, therefore, He created all
things for his seasonable use, alike those in the firmament, and those
on the earth, and those in the waters.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.x-p10"></span>Indeed, before the transgression all
things were under his power. For God set him as ruler over all things on
the earth and in the waters. Even the serpent <span
id="fr_1762"></span>[1763](#fn_1762) was accustomed to man, and
approached him more readily than it did other living creatures, and held
intercourse with him with delightful motions <span
id="fr_1763"></span>[1764](#fn_1763) . And hence it was through it that
the devil, the prince of evil, made his most wicked suggestion to our
first parents <span id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764) . Moreover, the
earth of its own accord used to yield fruits, for the benefit of the
animals that were obedient to man, and there was neither rain nor
tempest on the earth. But after the transgression, when he was compared
with the unintelligent cattle and became like to them <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765) , after he had contrived that in
him irrational desire should have rule over reasoning mind and had
become disobedient to the Master’s command, the subject creation rose up
against him whom the Creator had appointed to be ruler: and it was
appointed for him that he should till with sweat the earth from which he
had been taken.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.x-p15"></span>But even now wild beasts are not
without their uses, for, by the terror they cause, they bring man to the
knowledge of his Creator and lead him to call upon His name. And,
further, at the transgression the thorn sprung out of the earth in
accordance with the Lord’s express declaration and was conjoined with
the pleasures of the rose, that it might lead us to remember the
transgression on account of which the earth was condemned to bring forth
for us thorns and prickles <span id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.x-p17"></span>That this is the case is made worthy
of belief from the fact that their endurance is secured by the word of
the Lord, saying, *Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the
earth* <span id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.x-p19"></span>Further, some hold that the earth is
in the form of a sphere, others that it is in that of a cone. At all
events it is much smaller <span id="page_29b">p. 29b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.x-Page_29b"></span>than the heaven, and suspended almost
like a point in its midst. And it will pass away and be changed. But
blessed is the man who inherits the earth promised to the meek <span
id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.x-p21"></span>For the earth that is to be the
possession of the holy is immortal. Who, then, can fitly marvel at the
boundless and incomprehensible wisdom of the Creator? Or who can render
sufficient thanks to the Giver of so many blessings <span
id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769) ?

<span id="iii.iv.ii.x-p23"></span>\[There are also provinces, or
prefectures, of the earth which we recognise: Europe embraces thirty
four, and the huge continent of Asia has forty-eight of these provinces,
and twelve canons as they are called <span
id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770) .\]
