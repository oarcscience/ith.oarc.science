<span id="iii.iv.i.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*Concerning the nature
of Deity: that it is incomprehensible.*

<span id="iii.iv.i.iv-p2"></span>It is plain, then, that there is a God.
But what He is in His essence and nature is absolutely incomprehensible
and unknowable. For it is evident that He is incorporeal <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) . For how could that possess body
which is infinite, and boundless, and formless, and intangible and
invisible, in short, simple and not compound? How could that be
immutable <span id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) which is
circumscribed and subject to passion? And how could that be passionless
which is composed of elements and is resolved again into them? For
combination <span id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) is the beginning
of conflict, and conflict of separation, and separation of dissolution,
and dissolution is altogether foreign to God <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.iv-p7"></span>Again, how will it also be
maintained <span id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439.md) that God permeates
and fills the universe? as the Scriptures say, *Do not I fill heaven and
earth, saith the Lord* <span id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440.md) ? For
it is an impossibility <span id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441.md) that
one body should permeate other bodies without dividing and being
divided, and without being enveloped and contrasted, in the same way as
all fluids mix and commingle.

<span id="iii.iv.i.iv-p11"></span>But if some say that the body is
immaterial, in the same way as the fifth body <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) of which the Greek philosophers
speak (which body is an impossibility), it will be wholly subject to
motion like the heaven. For that is what they mean by the fifth body.
Who then is it that moves it? For everything that is moved is moved by
another thing. And who again is it that moves that? and so on to
infinity till we at length arrive at something motionless. For the first
mover is motionless, and that is the Deity. And must not that which is
moved be circumscribed in space? The Deity, then, alone is motionless,
moving the universe by immobility <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md) . So then it must be assumed that
the Deity is incorporeal.

<span id="iii.iv.i.iv-p14"></span>But even this gives no true idea of
His essence, to say that He is unbegotten, and without beginning,
changeless and imperishable, and possessed of such other qualities as we
are wont to ascribe to God and His environment <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md) . For these do not indicate what He
is, but what He is not <span id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) . But
when we would explain what <span id="page_4b">p. 4b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.i.iv-Page_4b"></span>the essence of anything is, we must not
speak only negatively. In the case of God, however, it is impossible to
explain what He is in His essence, and it befits us the rather to hold
discourse about His absolute separation from all things <span
id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md) . For He does not belong to the
class of existing things: not that He has no existence <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md) , but that He is above all existing
things, nay even above existence itself. For if all forms of knowledge
have to do with what exists, assuredly that which is above knowledge
must certainly be also above essence <span
id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) : and, conversely, that which is
above essence <span id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) will also be
above knowledge.

<span id="iii.iv.i.iv-p21"></span>God then is infinite and
incomprehensible and all that is comprehensible about Him is His
infinity and incomprehensibility. But all that we can affirm concerning
God does not shew forth God’s nature, but only the qualities of His
nature <span id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) . For when you speak
of Him as good, and just, and wise, and so forth, you do not tell God’s
nature but only the qualities of His nature <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md) . Further there are some
affirmations which we make concerning God which have the force of
absolute negation: for example, when we use the term darkness, in
reference to God, we do not mean darkness itself, but that He is not
light but above light: and when we speak of Him as light, we mean that
He is not darkness.

<span id="iii.iv.i.iv-p12"></span> The reference is to the Pythagorean
and Aristotelian ideas of the heavens as being like the body of Deity,
something uncorrupt, different from the four elements, and therefore
called a *fifth body*, or *element* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.iv-p12.1"></span>στοιχεῖον</span>). In his *Meteor*. i. 3,
*De Cœlo* i. 3, &c., Aristotle speaks of the Ether as extending from the
heaven of the fixed stars down to the moon, as of a nature specially
adapted for circular motion, as the first element in rank, but as the
*fifth*, “if we enumerate beginning with the elements directly known by
the senses.…the subsequently so-called <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.iv-p12.2"></span>πέμπτον στοιχεῖον</span>, *quinta
essentia*.” The other elements, he taught, had the upward motion, or the
downward: the earth having the attribute of heaviness, and its natural
place in the world being the lowest; fire being the light element, and
“its place the sphere next adjoining the sphere of the ether.” See
Ueberweg’s *History of Philosophy*, Vol. I. p. 167, Morris’s
translation, and the chapter on the De Cœlo in Grote’s Aristotle, Vol.
II. pp. 389, &c.
