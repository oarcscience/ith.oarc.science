<span id="iii.iv.ii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*Concerning Paradise.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xi-p2"></span>Now when God was about to fashion man
out of the visible and invisible creation in His own image and likeness
to reign as king and ruler over all the earth and all that it contains,
He first made for him, so to speak, a kingdom in which he should live a
life of happiness and prosperity <span
id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771.md) . And this is the divine
paradise <span id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772.md) , planted in Eden by
the hands of God, a very storehouse of joy and gladness of heart (for
“Eden” <span id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773.md) means
luxuriousness <span id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774) .md). Its site is
higher in the East than all the earth: it is temperate and the air that
surrounds it is the rarest and purest: evergreen plants are its pride,
sweet fragrances abound, it is flooded with light, and in sensuous
freshness and beauty it transcends imagination: in truth the place is
divine, a meet home for him who was created in God’s image: no creature
lacking reason made its dwelling there but man alone, the work of God’s
own hands.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xi-p7"></span>In its midst <span
id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775.md) God planted the tree of life and
the tree of knowledge <span id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776.md) . The
tree of knowledge was for trial, and proof, and exercise of man’s
obedience and disobedience: and hence it was named the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, or else it was because to those who partook
of it was given power to know their own nature. Now this is a good thing
for those who are mature, but an evil thing for the immature and those
whose appetites are too strong <span
id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777.md) , being like solid food to tender
babes still in need of milk <span id="fr_1778"></span>[1779](#fn_1778.md) .
For our Creator, God, did not intend us to be burdened with care and
troubled about many things, nor to take thought about, or make provision
for, our own life. But this at length was Adam’s fate: for he tasted and
knew that he was naked and made a girdle round about him: for he took
fig-leaves and girded himself about. But before they took of the fruit,
*They were both naked, Adam and Eve, and were not ashamed* <span
id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779.md) . For God meant that we should be
thus free from passion, and this is indeed the mark of a mind absolutely
void of passion. Yea, He meant us further to be free from care and to
have but one work to perform, to sing as do the angels, without ceasing
or intermission, the praises of the Creator, and to delight in
contemplation of Him and to cast all our care on Him. This is what the
Prophet David proclaimed to us when He said, *Cast thy burden on the
Lord, and He will sustain thee* <span
id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780.md) . And, again, in the Gospels,
Christ taught His disciples saying, *Take no thought for your life what
ye shall eat, nor for your body what ye shall put on* <span
id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781.md) . And further, *Seek ye first the
Kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added
unto you* <span id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782.md) . And to Martha He
said, *Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:
but one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which
shall not be taken away from her* <span
id="fr_1783"></span>[1784](#fn_1783.md) , meaning, clearly, sitting at His
feet and listening to His words.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xi-p17"></span>The tree of life, on the other hand,
was a tree having the energy that is the cause of life, or to be eaten
only by those who deserve to live and are not subject to death. Some,
indeed, have pictured Paradise as a realm of sense <span
id="fr_1784"></span>[1785](#fn_1784.md) , and others as a realm of mind.
But it seems to me, that, just as man is a creature, in whom we find
both sense and mind blended together, in like manner also man’s most
holy temple combines the properties of sense and mind, and has this
twofold expression: for, as we said, the life in the body is spent in
the most divine and lovely region, while the life in the soul is passed
in a place far more sublime and of more surpassing beauty, where God
makes His home, and where He wraps man about as with a glorious garment,
and robes him in His grace, and delights and sustains him like an angel
with the sweetest of all fruits, the contemplation of Himself. Verily it
has been fitly named the tree of life. For since the <span
id="page_30b">p. 30b</span> <span id="iii.iv.ii.xi-Page_30b"></span>life
is not cut short by death, the sweetness of the divine participation is
imparted to those who share it. And this is, in truth, what God meant by
every tree, saying, *Of every tree in Paradise thou mayest freely
eat* <span id="fr_1785"></span>[1786](#fn_1785.md) . For the ‘every’ is
just Himself in Whom and through Whom the universe is maintained. But
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was for the distinguishing
between the many divisions of contemplation, and this is just the
knowledge of one’s own nature, which, indeed, is a good thing for those
who are mature and advanced in divine contemplation (being of itself a
proclamation of the magnificence of God), and have no fear of
falling <span id="fr_1786"></span>[1787](#fn_1786.md) , because they have
through time come to have the habit of such contemplation, but it is an
evil thing to those still young and with stronger appetites, who by
reason of their insecure hold on the better part, and because as yet
they are not firmly established in the seat of the one and only good,
are apt to be torn and dragged away from this to the care of their own
body.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xi-p21"></span>Thus, to my thinking, the divine
Paradise is twofold, and the God-inspired Fathers handed down a true
message, whether they taught this doctrine or that. Indeed, it is
possible to understand by every tree the knowledge of the divine power
derived from created things. In the words of the divine Apostle, *For
the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly
seen, being understood by the things that are made* <span
id="fr_1787"></span>[1788](#fn_1787.md) . But of all these thoughts and
speculations the sublimest is that dealing with ourselves, that is, with
our own composition. As the divine David says, *The knowledge of Thee
from me* <span id="fr_1788"></span>[1789](#fn_1788.md) , that is from my
constitution, was made a wonder <span
id="fr_1789"></span>[1790](#fn_1789.md) . But for the reasons we have
already mentioned, such knowledge was dangerous for Adam who had been so
lately created <span id="fr_1790"></span>[1791](#fn_1790.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xi-p26"></span>The tree of life too may be
understood as that more divine thought that has its origin in the world
of sense, and the ascent through that to the originating and
constructive cause of all. And this was the name He gave to every tree,
implying fulness and indivisibility, and conveying only participation in
what is good. But by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, we are
to understand that sensible and pleasurable food which, sweet though it
seems, in reality brings him who partakes of it into communion with
evil. For God says, *Of every tree in Paradise thou mayest freely
eat* <span id="fr_1791"></span>[1792](#fn_1791.md) . It is, me-thinks, as
if God said, *Through all My creations thou art to ascend to Me thy
creator, and of all the fruits thou mayest pluck one, that is, Myself
who art the true life: let every thing bear for thee the fruit of life,
and let participation in Me be the support of your own being. For in
this way thou wilt be immortal. But of the tree of the knowledge of good
and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest
thereof thou shalt surely die* <span
id="fr_1792"></span>[1793](#fn_1792.md) . For sensible food is by nature
for the replenishing of that which gradually wastes away and it passes
into the drought and perisheth: and he cannot remain incorruptible who
partakes of sensible food.
