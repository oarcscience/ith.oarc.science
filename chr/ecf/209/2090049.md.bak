<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*Concerning the
place of God: and that the Deity alone is uncircumscribed.*

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p2"></span>Bodily place is the limit of that
which contains, by which that which is contained is contained <span
id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md) : for example, the air contains but
the body is contained <span id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615.md) . But
it is not the whole of the containing air which is the place of the
contained body, but the limit of the containing air, where it comes into
contact with the contained body: and the reason is clearly because that
which contains is not within that which it contains.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p5"></span>But there is also mental place where
mind is active, and mental and incorporeal nature exists: where mind
dwells and energises and is contained not in a bodily but in a mental
fashion. For it is without form, and so cannot be contained as a body
is. God, then, being immaterial <span
id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md) and uncircumscribed, has not place.
For He is His own place, filling all things and being above all things,
and Himself maintaining all things <span
id="fr_1617"></span>[1618](#fn_1617.md) . Yet we speak of God having place
and the place of God where His energy becomes manifest. For He
penetrates everything without mixing with it, and imparts to all His
energy in proportion to the fitness and receptive power of each: and by
this I mean, a purity both natural and voluntary. For the immaterial is
purer than the material, and that which is virtuous than that which is
linked with vice. Wherefore by the place of God is meant that which has
a greater share in His energy and grace. For this reason the Heaven is
His throne. For in it are the angels who do His will and are always
glorifying Him <span id="fr_1618"></span>[1619](#fn_1618.md) . For this is
His rest and the earth is His footstool <span
id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619.md) . For in it He dwelt in the flesh
among men <span id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md) . And His sacred
flesh has been named the foot of God. The Church, too, is spoken of as
the place of God: for we have set this apart for the glorifying of God
as a sort of consecrated place wherein we also hold converse with Him.
Likewise also the places in which His energy becomes manifest to us,
whether through the flesh or apart from flesh, are spoken of as the
places of God.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p11"></span>But it must be understood that the
Deity is indivisible, being everywhere wholly in His entirety and not
divided up part by part like that which has body, but wholly in
everything and wholly above everything.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p12"></span>Marg. <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p12.1"></span>ms.</span> Concerning the place of angel
and spirit, and concerning the uncircumscribed.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p13"></span>The angel, although not contained in
place with figured form as is body, yet is spoken of as being in place
because he has a mental presence and energises in accordance with his
nature, and is not elsewhere but has his mental limitations there where
he energises. For it is impossible to energise at the same time in
different places. For to God alone belongs the power of energising
everywhere <span id="page_16b">p. 16b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.i.xiii-Page_16b"></span>at the same time. The angel energises
in different places by the quickness of his nature and the promptness
and speed by which he can change his place: but the Deity, Who is
everywhere and above all, energises at the same time in diverse ways
with one simple energy.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p14"></span>Further the soul is bound up with
the body. whole with whole and not part with part: and it is not
contained by the body but contains it as fire does iron, and being in it
energises with its own proper energies.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p15"></span>That which is comprehended in place
or time or apprehension is circumscribed: while that which is contained
by none of these is uncircumscribed. Wherefore the Deity alone is
uncircumscribed, being without beginning and without end, and containing
all things, and in no wise apprehended <span
id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md) . For He alone is incomprehensible
and unbounded, within no one’s knowledge and contemplated by Himself
alone. But the angel is circumscribed alike in time (for His being had
commencement) and in place (but mental space, as we said above) and in
apprehension. For they know somehow the nature of each other and have
their bounds perfectly defined by the Creator. Bodies in short are
circumscribed both in beginning and end, and bodily place and
apprehension.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p17"></span>Marg. <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p17.1"></span>ms.</span> From various sources
concerning God and the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And
concerning the Word and the Spirit.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p18"></span>The Deity, then, is quite
unchangeable and invariable. For all things which are not in our hands
He hath predetermined by His foreknowledge, each in its own proper and
peculiar time and place. And accordingly *the Father judgeth no one, but
hath given all judgment to the Son* <span
id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622.md) . For clearly the Father and the
Son and also the Holy Spirit judged as God. But the Son Himself will
descend in the body as man, and will sit on the throne of Glory (for
descending and sitting require circumscribed body), and will judge all
the world in justice.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p20"></span>All things are far apart from God,
not in place but in nature. In our case, thoughtfulness, and wisdom, and
counsel come to pass and go away as states of being. Not so in the case
of God: for with Him there is no happening or ceasing to be: for He is
invariable and unchangeable: and it would not be right to speak of
contingency in connection with Him. For goodness is concomitant with
essence. He who longs alway after God, he seeth Him: for God is in all
things. Existing things are dependent on that which is, and nothing can
be unless it is in that which is. God then is mingled with everything,
maintaining their nature: and in His holy flesh the God-Word is made one
in subsistence and is mixed with our nature, yet without confusion.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p21"></span>*No one seeth the Father, save the
Son and the Spirit* <span id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p23"></span>The Son is the counsel and wisdom
and power of the Father. For one may not speak of quality in connection
with God, from fear of implying that He was a compound of essence and
quality.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p24"></span>The Son is from the Father, and
derives from Him all His properties: *hence He cannot do ought of
Himself* <span id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md) . For He has not
energy peculiar to Himself and distinct from the Father <span
id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p27"></span>That God Who is invisible by nature
is made visible by His energies, we perceive from the organisation and
government of the world <span id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p29"></span>The Son is the Father’s image, and
the Spirit the Son’s, through which Christ dwelling in man makes him
after his own image <span id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p31"></span>The Holy Spirit is God, being
between the unbegotten and the begotten, and united to the Father
through the Son <span id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628.md) . We speak of
the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the mind of Christ, the Spirit
of the Lord, the very Lord <span id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629.md) ,
the Spirit of adoption, of truth, of liberty, of wisdom (for He is the
creator of all these): filling all things with essence, maintaining all
things, filling the universe with essence, while yet the universe is not
the measure of His power.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p34"></span>God is everlasting and unchangeable
essence, creator of all that is, adored with pious consideration.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p35"></span>God is also Father, being ever
unbegotten, for He was born of no one, but hath begotten His co-eternal
Son: God is likewise Son, being always with the Father, born of the
Father timelessly, everlastingly, without flux or passion, or separation
from Him. God is also Holy Spirit, being sanctifying power,
subsistential, proceeding from the Father without separation, and
resting in the Son, identical in essence with Father and Son.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p36"></span>Word is that which is ever
essentially present with the Father. Again, word is also the natural
movement of the mind, according to which it is moved and thinks and
considers, <span id="page_17b">p. 17b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.i.xiii-Page_17b"></span>being as it were its own light and
radiance. Again, word is the thought that is spoken only within the
heart. And again, word is the utterance <span
id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md) that is the messenger of thought.
God therefore is Word <span id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631.md)
essential and enhypostatic: and the other three kinds of word are
faculties of the soul, and are not contemplated as having a proper
subsistence of their own. The first of these is the natural offspring of
the mind, ever welling <span id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md) up
naturally out of it: the second is the thought: and the third is the
utterance.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiii-p40"></span>The Spirit has various meanings.
There is the Holy Spirit: but the powers of the Holy Spirit are also
spoken of as spirits: the good messenger is also spirit: the demon also
is spirit: the soul too is spirit: and sometimes mind also is spoken of
as spirit. Finally the wind is spirit and the air is spirit.
