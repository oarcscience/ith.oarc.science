<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*The purpose* <span
id="fr_2628"></span>[2629](#fn_2628.md) *for which God in His foreknowledge
created persons who would sin and not repent.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3"></span>God in His goodness <span
id="fr_2629"></span>[2630](#fn_2629.md) brought what exists into being out
of nothing, and has foreknowledge of what will exist in the future. If,
therefore, they were not to exist in the future, they would neither be
evil in the future nor would they be foreknown. For knowledge is of what
exists and foreknowledge is of what will surely exist in the future. For
simple being comes first and then good or evil being. But if the very
existence of those, who through the goodness of God are in the future to
exist, were to be prevented by the fact that they were to become evil of
their own choice, evil would have prevailed over the goodness of God.
Wherefore God makes all His works good, but each becomes of its own
choice good or evil. Although, then, the Lord said, *Good were it for
that man that he had never been born* <span
id="fr_2630"></span>[2631](#fn_2630.md) , He said it in condemnation not of
His own creation but of the evil which His own creation had acquired by
his own choice and through his own heedlessness. For the heedlessness
that marks man’s judgment made His Creator’s beneficence of no profit to
him. It is just as if any one, when he had obtained riches and dominion
from a king, were to lord it over his benefactor, who, when he has
worsted him, will punish him as he deserves, if he should see him
keeping hold of the sovereignty to the end.
