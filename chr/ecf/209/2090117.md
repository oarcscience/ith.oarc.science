<span id="iii.iv.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*In reply to those who
ask if Christ’s subsistence is create or uncreate.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.v-p2"></span>The subsistence <span
id="fr_2266"></span>[2267](#fn_2266) of God the Word before the
Incarnation was simple and uncompound, and incorporeal and uncreate: but
after it became flesh, it became also the subsistence of the flesh, and
became compounded of divinity which it always possessed, and of flesh
which it had assumed: and it bears the properties of the two natures,
being made known in two natures: so that the one same subsistence is
both uncreate in divinity and create in humanity, visible and invisible.
For otherwise we are compelled either to divide the one Christ and speak
of two subsistences, or to deny the distinction between the natures and
thus introduce change and confusion.
