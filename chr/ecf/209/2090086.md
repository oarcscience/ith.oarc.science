<span id="iii.iv.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*Concerning the manner
of the Mutual Communication* <span id="fr_1984"></span>[1985](#fn_1984)
.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.iv-p3"></span>Now we have often said already that
essence is one thing and subsistence another, and that essence signifies
the common and general form <span id="fr_1985"></span>[1986](#fn_1985)
of subsistences of the same kind, such as God, man, while subsistence
marks the individual, that is to say, Father, Son, Holy Spirit, or
Peter, Paul. Observe, then, that the names, divinity and humanity,
denote essences or natures: while the names, God and man, are applied
both in connection with natures, as when we say that God is
incomprehensible essence, and that God is one, and with reference to
subsistences, that which is more specific having the name of the more
general applied to it, as when the Scripture says, *Therefore God, thy
God, hath anointed thee* <span id="fr_1986"></span>[1987](#fn_1986) , or
again, *There was a certain man in the land of Uz* <span
id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987) , for it was only to Job that
reference was made.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.iv-p7"></span>Therefore, in the case of our Lord
Jesus Christ, seeing that we recognise that He has two natures but only
one subsistence compounded of both, when we contemplate His natures we
speak of His divinity and His humanity, but when we contemplate the
subsistence compounded of the natures we sometimes use terms that have
reference to His double nature, as “Christ,” and “at once God and man,”
and “God Incarnate;” and sometimes those that imply only one of His
natures, as “God” alone, or “Son of God,” and “man” alone, or “Son of
Man;” sometimes using names that imply His loftiness and sometimes those
that imply His lowliness. For He Who is alike God and man is one, being
the former from the Father ever without <span
id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988) cause, but having become the latter
afterwards for His love towards man <span
id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.iv-p10"></span><span id="page_49b">p. 49b</span>
<span id="iii.iv.iii.iv-Page_49b"></span>When, then, we speak of His
divinity we do not ascribe to it the properties of humanity. For we do
not say that His divinity is subject to passion or created. Nor, again,
do we predicate of His flesh or of His humanity the properties of
divinity: for we do not say that His flesh or His humanity is uncreated.
But when we speak of His subsistence, whether we give it a name implying
both natures, or one that refers to only one of them, we still attribute
to it the properties of both natures. For Christ, which name implies
both natures, is spoken of as at once God and man, created and
uncreated, subject to suffering and incapable of suffering: and when He
is named Son of God and God, in reference to only one of His natures, He
still keeps the properties of the co-existing nature, that is, the
flesh, being spoken of as God who suffers, and as the Lord of Glory
crucified <span id="fr_1990"></span>[1991](#fn_1990) , not in respect of
His being God but in respect of His being at the same time man. Likewise
also when He is called Man and Son of Man, He still keeps the properties
and glories of the divine nature, a child before the ages, and man who
knew no beginning; it is not, however, as child or man but as God that
He is before the ages, and became a child in the end. And this is the
manner of the mutual communication, either nature giving in exchange to
the other its own properties through the identity of the subsistence and
the interpenetration of the parts with one another. Accordingly we can
say of Christ: *This our God was seen upon the earth and lived amongst
men* <span id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991) , and *This man is
uncreated and impossible and uncircumscribed.*
