<span id="iii.iv.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*In reply to the
question whether there is Nature that has no Subsistence.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.ix-p2"></span>For although <span
id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037.md) there is no nature without
subsistence, nor essence apart from person (since in truth it is in
persons and subsistences that essence and nature are to be
contemplated), yet it does not necessarily follow that the natures that
are united to one another in subsistence should have each its own proper
subsistence. For after they have come together into one subsistence, it
is possible that neither should they be without subsistence, nor should
each have its own peculiar subsistence, but that both should have one
and the same subsistence <span id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038.md) .
For since one and the same subsistence of the Word has become the
subsistence of the natures, neither of them is permitted to be without
subsistence, nor are they allowed to have subsistences that differ from
each other, or to have sometimes the subsistence of this nature and
sometimes of that, but always without division or separation they both
have the same subsistence—a subsistence which is not broken up into
parts or divided, so that one part should belong to this, and one to
that, but which belongs wholly to this and wholly to that in its
absolute entirety. For the flesh of God the Word did not subsist as an
independent subsistence, nor did there arise another subsistence besides
that of God the Word, but as it existed in that it became rather a
subsistence which subsisted in another, than one which was an
independent subsistence. Wherefore, neither does it lack subsistence
altogether, nor yet is there thus introduced into the Trinity another
subsistence.
