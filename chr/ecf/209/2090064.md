<span id="iii.iv.ii.xiii-Page_33b"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*Concerning
Pleasures.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xiii-p2"></span>There are pleasures of the soul and
pleasures of the body. The pleasures of the soul are those which are the
exclusive possession of the soul, such as the pleasures of learning and
contemplation. The pleasures of the body, however, are those which are
enjoyed by soul and body in fellowship, and hence are called bodily
pleasures: and such are the pleasures of food and intercourse and the
like. But one could not find any class of pleasures <span
id="fr_1817"></span>[1818](#fn_1817.md) belonging solely to the body <span
id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xiii-p5"></span>Again, some pleasures are true,
others false. And the exclusively intellectual pleasures consist in
knowledge and contemplation, while the pleasures of the body depend upon
sensation. Further, of bodily pleasures <span
id="fr_1819"></span>[1820](#fn_1819.md) , some are both natural and
necessary, in the absence of which life is impossible, for example the
pleasures of food which replenishes waste, and the pleasures of
necessary clothing. Others are natural but not necessary, as the
pleasures of natural and lawful intercourse. For though the function
that these perform is to secure the permanence of the race as a whole,
it is still possible to live a virgin life apart from them. Others,
however, are neither natural nor necessary, such as drunkenness, lust,
and surfeiting to excess. For these contribute neither to the
maintenance of our own lives nor to the succession of the race, but on
the contrary, are rather even a hindrance. He therefore that would live
a life acceptable to God must follow after those pleasures which are
both natural and necessary: and must give a secondary place to those
which are natural but not necessary, and enjoy them only in fitting
season, and manner, and measure; while the others must be altogether
renounced.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xiii-p7"></span>Those then are to be considered
moral <span id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820.md) pleasures which are not
bound up with pain, and bring no cause for repentance, and result in no
other harm and keep <span id="fr_1821"></span>[1822](#fn_1821.md) within
the bounds of moderation, and do not draw us far away from serious
occupations, nor make slaves of us.
