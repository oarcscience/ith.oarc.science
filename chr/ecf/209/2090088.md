<span id="iii.iv.iii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*That in one of its
subsistences the divine nature is united in its entirety to the human
nature, in its entirety and not only part to part.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.vi-p2"></span>What is common and general is
predicated of the included particulars. Essence, then, is common as
being a form <span id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998.md) , while
subsistence is particular. It is particular not as though it had part of
the nature and had not the rest, but particular in a numerical sense, as
being individual. For it is in number and not in nature that the
difference between subsistences is said to lie. Essence, therefore, is
predicated of subsistence, because in each subsistence of the same form
the essence is perfect. Wherefore subsistences do not differ from each
other in essence but in the accidents which indeed are the
characteristic properties, but characteristic of subsistence and not of
nature. For indeed they define subsistence as essence along with
accidents. So that the subsistence contains both the general and the
particular, and has an independent existence <span
id="fr_1999"></span>[2000](#fn_1999.md) , while essence has not an
independent existence but is contemplated in the subsistences.
Accordingly when one of the subsistences suffers, the whole essence,
being capable of suffering <span id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000.md) ,
is held to have suffered in one of its subsistences as much as the
subsistence suffered, but it does not necessarily follow, however, that
all the subsistences of the same class should suffer along with the
suffering subsistence.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.vi-p6"></span>Thus, therefore, we confess that the
nature of the Godhead is wholly and perfectly in each of its
subsistences, wholly in the Father, wholly in the Son, and wholly in the
Holy Spirit. Wherefore also the Father is perfect God, the Son is
perfect God, and the Holy Spirit is perfect God. In like manner, too, in
the Incarnation of the Trinity of the One God the Word of the Holy
Trinity, we hold that in one of its subsistences the nature of the
Godhead is wholly and perfectly united with the whole nature of
humanity, and not part united to part <span
id="fr_2001"></span>[2002](#fn_2001.md) . The divine Apostle in truth says
that *in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily* <span
id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002.md) , that is to say in His flesh. And
His divinely-inspired disciple, Dionysius, who had so deep a knowledge
of things divine, said that the Godhead as a whole had fellowship with
us in one of its own subsistences <span
id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003.md) . But we shall not be driven to
hold that all the subsistences of the Holy Godhead, to wit the three,
are made one in subsistence with all the subsistences of humanity. For
in no other respect did the Father and the Holy Spirit take part in the
incarnation of God the Word than according to good will and pleasure.
But we hold that to the whole of human nature the whole essence of the
Godhead was united. For God the Word omitted none of the things which He
implanted in our nature when He formed us in the beginning, but took
them all upon Himself, body and soul both intelligent and rational, and
all their properties. For the creature that is devoid of one of these is
not man. But He in His fulness took upon Himself me in my fulness, and
was united whole to whole that He might in His grace bestow salvation on
the whole man. For what has not been taken cannot be healed <span
id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.vi-p11"></span>The Word of God <span
id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005.md) , then, was united to flesh through
the medium of mind which is intermediate between the purity of God and
the grossness of flesh <span id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006.md) . For
the mind holds sway over soul and body, but while the mind is the purest
part of the soul God is that of the mind. And when it is allowed <span
id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007.md) by that which is more excellent,
the mind of Christ gives proof of its own authority <span
id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008.md) , but it is under the dominion of
and obedient to that which is more excellent, and does those things
which the divine will purposes.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.vi-p16"></span>Further the mind has become the seat
of the divinity united with it in subsistence, just as is evidently the
case with the body too, not as an inmate <span
id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009.md) , which is the impious error into
which the heretics fall when they say that one bushel cannot contain two
bushels, for they are judging what is immaterial by material standards.
How indeed could Christ be called perfect God and perfect man, and be
said to be of like essence with the Father and <span id="page_51b">p.
51b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iii.vi-Page_51b"></span>with us, if only
part of the divine nature is joined in Him to part of the human
nature <span id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010.md) ?

<span id="iii.iv.iii.vi-p19"></span>We hold, moreover, that our nature
has been raised from the dead and has ascended to the heavens and taken
its seat at the right hand of the Father: not that all the persons of
men have risen from the dead and taken their seat at the right hand of
the Father, but that this has happened to the whole of our nature in the
subsistence of Christ <span id="fr_2011"></span>[2012](#fn_2011.md) .
Verily the divine Apostle says, *God hath raised us up together and made
us sit together in Christ* <span id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.vi-p22"></span>And this further we hold, that the
union took place through common essences. For every essence is common to
the subsistences contained in it, and there cannot be found a partial
and particular nature, that is to say, essence: for otherwise we would
have to hold that the same subsistences are at once the same and
different in essence, and that the Holy Trinity in respect of the
divinity is at once the same and different in essence. So then the same
nature is to be observed in each of the subsistences, and when we said
that the nature of the word became flesh, as did the blessed Athanasius
and Cyrillus, we mean that the divinity was joined to the flesh. Hence
we cannot say “The nature of the Word suffered;” for the divinity in it
did not suffer, but we say that the human nature, not by any means,
however, meaning <span id="fr_2013"></span>[2014](#fn_2013.md) all the
subsistences of men, suffered in Christ, and we confess further that
Christ suffered in His human nature. So that when we speak of the nature
of the Word we mean the Word Himself. And the Word has both the general
element of essence and the particular element of subsistence.
