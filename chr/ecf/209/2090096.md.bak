<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*Concerning the
volitions and free-will of our Lord Jesus Christ.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p2"></span>Since, then, Christ has two natures,
we hold that He has also two natural wills and two natural energies. But
since His two natures have one subsistence, we hold that it is one and
the same person who wills and energises naturally in both natures, of
which, and in which, and also which is Christ our Lord: and moreover
that He wills and energises without separation but as a united whole.
For He wills and energises in either form in close communion with the
other <span id="fr_2081"></span>[2082](#fn_2081.md) . For things that have
the same essence have also the same will and energy, while things that
are different in essence are different in will and energy <span
id="fr_2082"></span>[2083](#fn_2082.md) ; and *vice versa*, things that
have the same will and energy have the same essence, while things that
are different in will and energy are different in essence.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p5"></span>Wherefore <span
id="fr_2083"></span>[2084](#fn_2083.md) in the case of the Father and Son
and Holy Spirit we recognise, from their sameness in will and energy,
their sameness in nature. But in the case of the divine
dispensation <span id="fr_2084"></span>[2085](#fn_2084.md) we recognise
from their difference in will and energy the difference of the two
natures, and as we perceive the difference of the two natures we confess
that the wills and energies also are different. For just as the number
of the natures of one and the same Christ, when considered and spoken of
with piety, do not cause a division of the one Christ but merely bring
out the fact that the difference between the natures is maintained even
in the union, so it is with the number of wills and energies that belong
essentially to His natures. (For He was endowed with the powers of
willing and energising in both natures, for the sake of our salvation.)
It does not introduce division: God forbid! but merely brings out the
fact that the differences between them are safeguarded and preserved
even in the union. For we hold that wills and energies are faculties
belonging to nature, not to subsistence; I mean those faculties of will
and energy by which He Who wills and energises does so. For if we allow
that they belong to subsistence, we will be forced to say that the three
subsistences of the Holy Trinity have different wills and different
energies.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p8"></span>For it is to be noted <span
id="fr_2085"></span>[2086](#fn_2085.md) that willing and the manner of
willing are not the same thing. For to will is a faculty of nature, just
as <span id="page_58b">p. 58b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-Page_58b"></span>seeing is, for all men possess it;
but the manner of willing does not depend on nature but on our judgment,
just as does also the manner of seeing, whether well or ill. For all men
do not will in the same way, nor do they all see in the same way. And
this also we will grant in connection with energies. For the manner of
willing, or seeing, or energising, is the mode of using the faculties of
will and sight and energy, belonging only to him who uses them, and
marking him off from others by the generally accepted difference.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p10"></span>Simple willing then is spoken of as
volition or the faculty of will <span
id="fr_2086"></span>[2087](#fn_2086.md) , being a rational propension <span
id="fr_2087"></span>[2088](#fn_2087.md) and natural will; but in a
particular way willing, or that which underlies volition, is the object
of will <span id="fr_2088"></span>[2089](#fn_2088.md) , and will dependent
on judgment <span id="fr_2089"></span>[2090](#fn_2089.md) . Further that
which has innate in it the faculty of volition is spoken of as capable
of willing <span id="fr_2090"></span>[2091](#fn_2090.md) : as for instance
the divine is capable of willing, and the human in like manner. But he
who exercises volition, that is to say the subsistence, for instance
Peter, is spoken of as willing.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p16"></span>Since, then <span
id="fr_2091"></span>[2092](#fn_2091.md) , Christ is one and His subsistence
is one, He also Who wills both as God and as man is one and the same.
And since He has two natures endowed with volition, inasmuch as they are
rational (for whatever is rational is endowed with volition and
free-will), we shall postulate two volitions or natural wills in Him.
For He in His own person is capable of volition in accordance with both
His natures. For He assumed that faculty of volition which belongs
naturally to us. And since Christ, Who in His own person wills according
to either nature, is one, we shall postulate the same object of will in
His case, not as though He wills only those things which He willed
naturally as God (for it is no part of Godhead to will to eat or drink
and so forth), but as willing also those things which human nature
requires for its support <span id="fr_2092"></span>[2093](#fn_2092.md) ,
and this without involving any opposition in judgment, but simply as the
result of the individuality of the natures. For then it was that He thus
willed naturally, when His divine volition so willed and permitted the
flesh to suffer and do that which was proper to it.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p19"></span>But that volition is implanted in
man by nature <span id="fr_2093"></span>[2094](#fn_2093.md) is manifest
from this. Excluding the divine life, there are three forms of life: the
vegetative, the sentient, and the intellectual. The properties of the
vegetative life are the functions of nourishment, and growth, and
production: that of the sentient life is impulse: and that of the
rational and intellectual life is freedom of will. If, then, nourishment
belongs by nature to the vegetative life and impulse to the sentient,
freedom of will by nature belongs to the rational and intellectual life.
But freedom of will is nothing else than volition. The Word, therefore,
having become flesh, endowed with life and mind and free-will, became
also endowed with volition.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p21"></span>Further, that which is natural is
not the result of training: for no one learns how to think, or live, or
hunger, or thirst, or sleep. Nor do we learn how to will: so that
willing is natural.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p22"></span>And again: if in the case of
creatures devoid of reason nature rules, while nature is ruled in man
who is moved of his own free-will and volition, it follows, then, that
man is by nature endowed with volition.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p23"></span>And again: if man has been made
after the image of the blessed and super-essential Godhead, and if the
divine nature is by nature endowed with free-will and volition, it
follows that man, as its image, is free by nature and volitive <span
id="fr_2094"></span>[2095](#fn_2094.md) . For the fathers defined freedom
as volition <span id="fr_2095"></span>[2096](#fn_2095.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p26"></span>And further: if to will is a part
of the nature of every man and not present in some and absent in others,
and if that which is seen to be common to all is a characteristic
feature of the nature that belongs to the individuals of the class,
surely, then, man is by nature endowed with volition <span
id="fr_2096"></span>[2097](#fn_2096.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p28"></span>And once more: if the nature
receives neither more nor less, but all are equally endowed with
volition and not some more than others, then by nature man is endowed
with volition <span id="fr_2097"></span>[2098](#fn_2097.md) . So that since
man is by nature endowed with volition, the Lord also must be by nature
endowed with volition, not only because He is God, but also because He
became man. For just as He assumed our nature, so also He has assumed
naturally our will. And in this way the Fathers said that He formed our
will in Himself <span id="fr_2098"></span>[2099](#fn_2098.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p31"></span>If the will is not natural, it must
be either hypostatic or unnatural. But if it is hypostatic, the Son must
thus, forsooth, have a different will from what the Father has: for that
which is hypostatic is characteristic of subsistence only. And if it is
unnatural, will must be a defection from nature: for <span
id="page_59b">p. 59b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-Page_59b"></span>what is unnatural is destructive of
what is natural.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p32"></span>The God and Father of all things
wills either as Father or as God. Now if as Father, His will will be
different from that of the Son, for the Son is not the Father. But if as
God, the Son is God and likewise the Holy Spirit is God, and so volition
is part of His nature, that is, it is natural.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p33"></span>Besides <span
id="fr_2099"></span>[2100](#fn_2099.md) , if according to the view of the
Fathers, those who have one and the same will have also one and the same
essence, and if the divinity and humanity of Christ have one and the
same will, then assuredly these have also one and the same essence.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p35"></span>And again: if according to the view
of the Fathers the distinction between the natures is not seen in the
single will, we must either, when we speak of the one will, cease to
speak of the different natures in Christ or, when we speak of the
different natures of Christ, cease to speak of the one will.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p36"></span>And further <span
id="fr_2100"></span>[2101](#fn_2100.md) , the divine Gospel says, *The Lord
came into the borders of Tyre and Sidon and entered into a house, and
would have no man know it; but He could not be hid* <span
id="fr_2101"></span>[2102](#fn_2101.md) . If, then, His divine will is
omnipotent, but yet, though He would, He could not be hid, surely it was
as man that He would and could not, and so as man He must be endowed
with volition.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p39"></span>And once again <span
id="fr_2102"></span>[2103](#fn_2102.md) , the Gospel tells us that, *He,
having come into the place, said ‘I thirst’: and they gave Him some
vinegar mixed with gall, and when He had tasted it He would not
drink* <span id="fr_2103"></span>[2104](#fn_2103.md) . If, then, on the one
hand it was as God that He suffered thirst and when He had tasted would
not drink, surely He must be subject to passion <span
id="fr_2104"></span>[2105](#fn_2104.md) also as God, for thirst and taste
are passions <span id="fr_2105"></span>[2106](#fn_2105.md) . But if it was
not as God but altogether as man that He was athirst, likewise as man He
must be endowed with volition <span id="fr_2106"></span>[2107](#fn_2106.md)
.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p45"></span>Moreover, the blessed Paul the
Apostle says, *He became obedient unto death, even the death of the
cross* <span id="fr_2107"></span>[2108](#fn_2107.md) . But obedience is
subjection of the real will, not of the unreal will. For that which is
irrational is not said to be obedient or disobedient <span
id="fr_2108"></span>[2109](#fn_2108.md) . But the Lord having become
obedient to the Father, became so not as God but as man. For as God He
is not said to be obedient or disobedient. For these things are of the
things that are under one’s hand <span
id="fr_2109"></span>[2110](#fn_2109.md) , as the inspired Gregorius
said <span id="fr_2110"></span>[2111](#fn_2110.md) . Wherefore, then,
Christ is endowed with volition as man.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p50"></span>While, however, we assert that will
is natural, we hold not that it is dominated by necessity, but that it
is free. For if it is rational, it must be absolutely free. For it is
not only the divine and uncreated nature that is free from the bonds of
necessity, but also the intellectual and created nature. And this is
manifest: for God, being by nature good and being by nature the Creator
and by nature God, is not all this of necessity. For who is there to
introduce this necessity?

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p51"></span>It is to be observed further <span
id="fr_2111"></span>[2112](#fn_2111.md) , that freedom of will is used in
several senses, one in connection with God, another in connection with
angels, and a third in connection with men. For used in reference to God
it is to be understood in a superessential manner, and in reference to
angels it is to be taken in the sense that the election is concomitant
with the state <span id="fr_2112"></span>[2113](#fn_2112.md) , and admits
of the interposition of no interval of time at all: for while the angel
possesses free-will by nature, he uses it without let or hindrance,
having neither antipathy on the part of the body to overcome nor any
assailant. Again, used in reference to men, it is to be taken in the
sense that the state is considered to be anterior in time to the
election. For man is free and has free-will by nature, but he has also
the assault of the devil to impede him and the motion of the body: and
thus through the assault and the weight of the body, election comes to
be later than the state.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p54"></span>If, then, Adam <span
id="fr_2113"></span>[2114](#fn_2113.md) obeyed of his own will and ate of
his own will, surely in us the will is the first part to suffer. And if
the will is the first to suffer, and the Word Incarnate did not assume
this with the rest of our nature, it follows that we have not been freed
from sin.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p56"></span>Moreover, if the faculty of
free-will which is in nature is His work and yet He did not assume it,
He either condemned His own workmanship as not good, or grudged us the
comfort it brought, and so deprived us of the full benefit, and shewed
that He was Himself subject to passion since He was not willing or not
able to work out our perfect salvation.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p57"></span>Moreover, one cannot speak of one
com<span id="page_60b">p. 60b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-Page_60b"></span>pound thing made of two wills in the
same way as a subsistence is a composition of two natures. Firstly
because the compositions are of things in subsistence (*hypotasis*), not
of things viewed in a different category, not in one proper to
them <span id="fr_2114"></span>[2115](#fn_2114.md) : and secondly, because
if we speak of composition of wills and energies, we will be obliged to
speak of composition of the other natural properties, such as the
uncreated and the created, the invisible and the visible, and so on. And
what will be the name of the will that is compounded out of two wills?
For the compound cannot be called by the name of the elements that make
it up. For otherwise we should call that which is compounded of natures
nature and not subsistence. And further, if we say that there is one
compound will in Christ, we separate Him in will from the Father, for
the Father’s will is not compound. It remains, therefore, to say that
the subsistence of Christ alone is compound and common, as in the case
of the natures so also in that of the natural properties.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p59"></span>And we cannot <span
id="fr_2115"></span>[2116](#fn_2115.md) , if we wish to be accurate, speak
of Christ as having judgment (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p60.1"></span>γνώμη</span>) and preference <span
id="fr_2116"></span>[2117](#fn_2116.md) . For judgment is a disposition
with reference to the decision arrived at after investigation and
deliberation concerning something unknown, that is to say, after counsel
and decision. And after judgment comes preference <span
id="fr_2117"></span>[2118](#fn_2117.md) , which chooses out and selects the
one rather than the other. But the Lord being not mere man but also God,
and knowing all things, had no need of inquiry, and investigation, and
counsel, and decision, and by nature made whatever is good His own and
whatever is bad foreign to Him <span
id="fr_2118"></span>[2119](#fn_2118.md) . For thus says Isaiah the prophet,
*Before the child shall know to prefer the evil, he shall choose the
good; because before the child knows good or evil, he refuses wickedness
by choosing the good* <span id="fr_2119"></span>[2120](#fn_2119.md) . For
the word “before” proves that it is not with investigation and
deliberation, as is the way with us, but as God and as subsisting in a
divine manner in the flesh, that is to say, being united in subsistence
to the flesh, and because of His very existence and all-embracing
knowledge, that He is possessed of good in His own nature. For the
virtues are natural qualities <span id="fr_2120"></span>[2121](#fn_2120.md)
, and are implanted in all by nature and in equal measure, even if we do
not all in equal measure employ our natural energies. By the
transgression we were driven from the natural to the unnatural <span
id="fr_2121"></span>[2122](#fn_2121.md) . But the Lord led us back from the
unnatural into the natural <span id="fr_2122"></span>[2123](#fn_2122.md) .
For this is what is the meaning of *in our image, after our
likeness* <span id="fr_2123"></span>[2124](#fn_2123.md) . And the
discipline and trouble of this life were not designed as a means for our
attaining virtue which was foreign to our nature, but to enable us to
cast aside the evil that was foreign and contrary to our nature: just as
on laboriously removing from steel the rust which is not natural to it
but acquired through neglect, we reveal the natural brightness of the
steel.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p69"></span>Observe further that the word
judgment (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xiv-p69.1"></span>γνώμη</span>) is used in many ways and
in many senses. Sometimes it signifies exhortation: as when the divine
apostle says, *Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord;
yet I give my judgment* <span id="fr_2124"></span>[2125](#fn_2124.md) :
sometimes it means counsel, as when the prophet David says, *They have
taken crafty counsel against Thy people* <span
id="fr_2125"></span>[2126](#fn_2125.md) : sometimes it means a decree, as
when we read in Daniel, *Concerning whom* (or, *what*) *went this
shameless decree forth* <span id="fr_2126"></span>[2127](#fn_2126.md) ? At
other times it is used in the sense of belief, or opinion, or purpose,
and, to put it shortly, the word judgment has twenty-eight <span
id="fr_2127"></span>[2128](#fn_2127.md) different meanings.
