<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII</span>.—*Regarding the
things said concerning Christ.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p2"></span>The things said concerning Christ
fall into four generic modes. For some fit Him even before the
incarnation, others in the union, others after the union, and others
after the resurrection. Also of those that refer to the period before
the incarnation there are six modes: for some of them declare the union
of nature and the identity in essence with the Father, as this, *I and
My Father are one* <span id="fr_2534"></span>[2535](#fn_2534.md) : also
this, *He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father* <span
id="fr_2535"></span>[2536](#fn_2535.md) : and this, *Who being in the form
of God* <span id="fr_2536"></span>[2537](#fn_2536.md) , and so forth.
Others declare the perfection of subsistence, as these, *Son of God*,
and *the Express Image of His person* <span
id="fr_2537"></span>[2538](#fn_2537.md) , and *Messenger of great counsel,
Wonderful Counsellor* <span id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538.md) , and
the like.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p8"></span>Again, others declare the
indwelling <span id="fr_2539"></span>[2540](#fn_2539.md) of the
subsistences in one another, as, *I am in the Father and the Father in
Me* <span id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540.md) ; and the inseparable
foundation <span id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541.md) , as, for
instance, the Word, Wisdom, Power, Effulgence. For the word is
inseparably established in the mind (and it is the essential mind that I
mean), and so also is wisdom, and power in him that is powerful, and
effulgence in the light, all springing forth from these <span
id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p13"></span>And others make known the fact of
His origin from the Father as cause, for instance *My Father is greater
than I* <span id="fr_2543"></span>[2544](#fn_2543.md) . For from Him He
derives both His being and all that He has <span
id="fr_2544"></span>[2545](#fn_2544.md) : His being was by generative and
not by creative means, as, *I came forth from the Father and am
come* <span id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545.md) , and *I live by the
Father <span id="fr_2546"></span>[2547](#fn_2546.md)* . But all that He
hath is not His by free gift or by teaching, but in a causal sense, as,
*The Son can do nothing of Himself but what He seeth the Father
do* <span id="fr_2547"></span>[2548](#fn_2547.md) . For if the Father is
not, neither is the Son. For the Son is of the Father and in the Father
and with the Father, and not after <span
id="fr_2548"></span>[2549](#fn_2548.md) the Father. In like manner also
what He doeth is of Him and with Him. For there is one and the same, not
similar but the same, will and energy and power in the Father, Son and
Holy Spirit.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p20"></span>Moreover, other things are said as
though the Father’s good-will was fulfilled <span
id="fr_2549"></span>[2550](#fn_2549.md) through His energy, and not as
through an instrument or a servant, but as through His essential and
hypostatic Word and Wisdom and Power, because but one action <span
id="fr_2550"></span>[2551](#fn_2550.md) is observed in Father and Son, as
for example, *All things were made by Him* <span
id="fr_2551"></span>[2552](#fn_2551.md) , and *He sent His Word and healed
them* <span id="fr_2552"></span>[2553](#fn_2552.md) , and *That they may
believe that Thou hast sent Me* <span
id="fr_2553"></span>[2554](#fn_2553.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p26"></span>Some, again, have a prophetic
sense, and of these some are in the future tense: for instance, *He
shall come openly* <span id="fr_2554"></span>[2555](#fn_2554.md) , and this
from Zechariah, *Behold, thy King cometh unto thee* <span
id="fr_2555"></span>[2556](#fn_2555.md) , and this from Micah, *Behold, the
Lord cometh out of His place and will come down and tread upon the high
places of the earth* <span id="fr_2556"></span>[2557](#fn_2556.md) . But
others, though future, are put in the past tense, as, for instance,
*This is our God: Therefore He was seen upon the earth and dwelt among
men* <span id="fr_2557"></span>[2558](#fn_2557.md) , and *The Lord created
me in the beginning of His ways for His works* <span
id="fr_2558"></span>[2559](#fn_2558.md) , and *Wherefore God, thy God,
anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows* <span
id="fr_2559"></span>[2560](#fn_2559.md) , and such like.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p33"></span>The things said, then, that refer
to the period before the union will be applicable to Him even after the
union: but those that refer to the period after the union will not be
applicable at all before the union, unless indeed in a prophetic sense,
as we said. Those that refer to the time of the union have three modes.
For when our discourse deals with the higher aspect, we speak of the
deification of the flesh, and His assumption of the Word and exceeding
exaltation, and so forth, making manifest the riches that are added to
the flesh from the union and natural conjunction with the most high God
the Word. And when our discourse deals with the lower aspect, we speak
of the incarnation of God the Word, His becoming man, His emptying of
Himself, His poverty, His humility. For these and such like are imposed
upon the Word and <span id="page_91b">p. 91b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-Page_91b"></span>God through His admixture with
humanity. When again we keep both sides in view at the same time, we
speak of union, community, anointing, natural conjunction, conformation
and the like. The former two modes, then, have their reason in this
third mode. For through the union it is made clear what either has
obtained from the intimate junction with and permeation through the
other. For through the union <span id="fr_2560"></span>[2561](#fn_2560.md)
in subsistence the flesh is said to be deified and to become God and to
be equally God with the Word; and God the Word is said to be made flesh,
and to become man, and is called creature and last <span
id="fr_2561"></span>[2562](#fn_2561.md) : not in the sense that the two
natures are converted into one compound nature (for it is not possible
for the opposite natural qualities to exist at the same time in one
nature) <span id="fr_2562"></span>[2563](#fn_2562.md) , but in the sense
that the two natures are united in subsistence and permeate one another
without confusion or transmutation. The permeation <span
id="fr_2563"></span>[2564](#fn_2563.md) moreover did not come of the flesh
but of the divinity: for it is impossible that the flesh should permeate
through the divinity: but the divine nature once permeating through the
flesh gave also to the flesh the same ineffable power of
permeation <span id="fr_2564"></span>[2565](#fn_2564.md) ; and this indeed
is what we call union.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p39"></span>Note, too, that in the case of the
first and second modes of those that belong to the period of the union,
reciprocation is observed. For when we speak about the flesh, we use the
terms deification and assumption of the Word and exceeding exaltation
and anointing. For these are derived from divinity, but are observed in
connection with the flesh. And when we speak about the Word, we use the
terms emptying, incarnation, becoming man, humility and the like: and
these, as we said, are imposed on the Word and God through the flesh.
For He endured these things in person of His own free-will.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p40"></span>Of the things that refer to the
period after the union there are three modes. The first declares His
divine nature, as, *I am in the Father and the Father in Me* <span
id="fr_2565"></span>[2566](#fn_2565.md) , and *I and the Father are
one* <span id="fr_2566"></span>[2567](#fn_2566.md) : and all those things
which are affirmed of Him before His assumption of humanity, these will
be affirmed of Him even after His assumption of humanity, with this
exception, that He did not assume the flesh and its natural properties.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p43"></span>The second declares His human
nature, as, *Now ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the
truth* <span id="fr_2567"></span>[2568](#fn_2567.md) , and *Even so must
the Son of Man be lifted up* <span id="fr_2568"></span>[2569](#fn_2568.md)
, and the like.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p46"></span>Further, of the statements made
and written about Christ the Saviour after the manner of men, whether
they deal with sayings or actions, there are six modes. For some of them
were done or said naturally in accordance with the incarnation; for
instance, His birth from a virgin, His growth and progress with age, His
hunger, thirst, weariness, fear, sleep, piercing with nails, death and
all such like natural and innocent passions <span
id="fr_2569"></span>[2570](#fn_2569.md) . For in all these there is a
mixture of the divine and human, although they are held to belong in
reality to the body, the divine suffering none of these, but procuring
through them our salvation.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p48"></span>Others are of the nature of
ascription <span id="fr_2570"></span>[2571](#fn_2570.md) , as Christ’s
question, *Where have ye laid Lazarus* <span
id="fr_2571"></span>[2572](#fn_2571.md) ? His running to the fig-tree, His
shrinking, that is, His drawing back, His praying, and His making *as
though He would have gone further* <span
id="fr_2572"></span>[2573](#fn_2572.md) For neither as God nor as man was
He in need of these or similar things, but only because His form was
that of a man as necessity and expediency demanded <span
id="fr_2573"></span>[2574](#fn_2573.md) . For example, the praying was to
shew that He is not opposed to God, for He gives honour to the Father as
the cause of Himself <span id="fr_2574"></span>[2575](#fn_2574.md) : and
the question was not put in ignorance but to shew that He is in truth
man as well as God <span id="fr_2575"></span>[2576](#fn_2575.md) ; and the
drawing back is to teach us not to be impetuous nor to give ourselves
up.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p55"></span>Others again are said in the
manner of association and relation <span
id="fr_2576"></span>[2577](#fn_2576.md) , as, *My God, My God, why hast
Thou forsaken Me* <span id="fr_2577"></span>[2578](#fn_2577.md) *?* and *He
hath made Him to be sin for us, Who knew no sin* <span
id="fr_2578"></span>[2579](#fn_2578.md) *, and being made a curse for
us* <span id="fr_2579"></span>[2580](#fn_2579.md) ; also, *Then shall the
Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under
Him* <span id="fr_2580"></span>[2581](#fn_2580.md) For neither as God nor
as man <span id="fr_2581"></span>[2582](#fn_2581.md) was He ever forsaken
by the Father, nor did He become sin or a curse, nor did He require to
be made subject to the Father. For as God He is equal to the Father and
not opposed to Him nor subjected to Him; and as God, He was never at any
time disobedient to His Begetter to make it necessary for Him to make
Him subject <span id="fr_2582"></span>[2583](#fn_2582.md) . Appropriating,
then, our person and ranking Himself with us, He used these words. For
we are bound in the fetters of sin and the curse as faithless and
disobedient, and therefore forsaken.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p63"></span>Others are said by reason of
distinction in thought. For if you divide in thought things that are
inseparable in actual truth, to cut the flesh from the Word, the terms
<span id="page_92b">p. 92b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-Page_92b"></span> ‘servant’ and ‘ignorant’ are used
of Him, for indeed He was of a subject and ignorant nature, and except
that it was united with God the Word, His flesh was servile and
ignorant <span id="fr_2583"></span>[2584](#fn_2583.md) . But because of the
union in subsistence with God the Word it was neither servile nor
ignorant. In this way, too, He called the Father His God.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p65"></span>Others again are for the purpose
of revealing Him to us and strengthening our faith, as, *And now, O
Father, glorify Thou Me with the glory which I had with Thee, before the
world was* <span id="fr_2584"></span>[2585](#fn_2584.md) . For He Himself
was glorified and is glorified, but His glory was not manifested nor
confirmed to us. Also that which the apostle said, *Declared to be the
Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the
resurrection from the dead* <span id="fr_2585"></span>[2586](#fn_2585.md) .
For by the miracles and the resurrection and the coming of the Holy
Spirit it was manifested and confirmed to the world that He is the Son
of God <span id="fr_2586"></span>[2587](#fn_2586.md) . And this too <span
id="fr_2587"></span>[2588](#fn_2587.md) , *The Child grew in wisdom and
grace* <span id="fr_2588"></span>[2589](#fn_2588.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p71"></span>Others again have reference to His
appropriation of the personal life of the Jews, in numbering Himself
among the Jews, as He saith to the Samaritan woman, *Ye worship ye know
not what: we know what we worship, far salvation is of the Jews* <span
id="fr_2589"></span>[2590](#fn_2589.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p73"></span>The third mode is one which
declares the one subsistence and brings out the dual nature: for
instance, *And I live by the Father: so he that eateth Me, even he shall
live by Me* <span id="fr_2590"></span>[2591](#fn_2590.md) . And this: *I go
to My Father and ye see Me no more* <span
id="fr_2591"></span>[2592](#fn_2591.md) . And this: *They would not have
crucified the Lord of Glory* <span id="fr_2592"></span>[2593](#fn_2592.md)
. And this: *And no man hath ascended up to heaven but He that came down
from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven* <span
id="fr_2593"></span>[2594](#fn_2593.md) , and such like.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p78"></span>Again of the affirmations that
refer to the period after the resurrection some are suitable to God, as,
*Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost* <span id="fr_2594"></span>[2595](#fn_2594.md) , for here ‘Son’
is clearly used as God; also this, *And lo, I am with you alway, even
unto the end of the world* <span id="fr_2595"></span>[2596](#fn_2595.md) ,
and other similar ones. For He is with us as God. Others are suitable to
man, as, *They held Him by the feet* <span
id="fr_2596"></span>[2597](#fn_2596.md) , and *There they will see
Me* <span id="fr_2597"></span>[2598](#fn_2597.md) , and so forth.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p83"></span>Further, of those referring to the
period after the Resurrection that are suitable to man there are
different modes. For some did actually take place, yet not according to
nature <span id="fr_2598"></span>[2599](#fn_2598.md) , but according to
dispensation, in order to confirm the fact that the very body, which
suffered, rose again; such are the weals, the eating and the drinking
after the resurrection. Others took place actually and naturally, as
changing from place to place without trouble and passing in through
closed gates. Others have the character of simulation <span
id="fr_2599"></span>[2600](#fn_2599.md) , as, *He made as though He would
have gone further* <span id="fr_2600"></span>[2601](#fn_2600.md) . Others
are appropriate to the double nature, as, *I ascend unto My Father and
your Father, and My God and your God* <span
id="fr_2601"></span>[2602](#fn_2601.md) , and *The King of Glory shall come
in* <span id="fr_2602"></span>[2603](#fn_2602.md) , and *He sat down on the
right hand of the majesty on High* <span
id="fr_2603"></span>[2604](#fn_2603.md) . Finally others are to be
understood as though He were ranking Himself with us, in the manner of
separation in pure thought, as, *My God and your God* <span
id="fr_2604"></span>[2605](#fn_2604.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xviii-p91"></span>Those then that are sublime must
be assigned to the divine nature, which is superior to passion and body:
and those that are humble must be ascribed to the human nature; and
those that are common must be attributed to the compound, that is, the
one Christ, Who is God and man. And it should be understood that both
belong to one and the same Jesus Christ, our Lord. For if we know what
is proper to each, and perceive that both are performed by one and the
same, we shall have the true faith and shall not go astray. And from all
these the difference between the united natures is recognised, and the
fact <span id="fr_2605"></span>[2606](#fn_2605.md) that, as the most godly
Cyril says, they are not identical in the natural quality of their
divinity and humanity. But yet there is but one Son and Christ and Lord:
and as He is one, He has also but one person, the unity in subsistence
being in nowise broken up into parts by the recognition of the
difference of the natures.
