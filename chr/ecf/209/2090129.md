<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvii-Page_89b"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII</span>.—*Concerning
Scripture* <span id="fr_2513"></span>[2514](#fn_2513.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvii-p3"></span>It is one and the same God Whom both
the Old and the New Testament proclaim, Who is praised and glorified in
the Trinity: *I am come*, saith the Lord, *not to destroy the law but to
fulfil it* <span id="fr_2514"></span>[2515](#fn_2514.md) . For He Himself
worked out our salvation for which all Scripture and all mystery exists.
And again, *Search the Scriptures for they are they that testify of
Me* <span id="fr_2515"></span>[2516](#fn_2515.md) . And the Apostle says,
*God, Who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto
the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by
His Son* <span id="fr_2516"></span>[2517](#fn_2516.md) . Through the Holy
Spirit, therefore, both the law and the prophets, the evangelists and
apostles and pastors and teachers, spake.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvii-p7"></span>All Scripture, then, is *given by
inspiration of God and is also assuredly profitable* <span
id="fr_2517"></span>[2518](#fn_2517.md) . Wherefore to search the
Scriptures is a work most fair and most profitable for souls. For just
as the tree planted by the channels of waters, so also the soul watered
by the divine Scripture is enriched and gives fruit in its season <span
id="fr_2518"></span>[2519](#fn_2518.md) , viz. orthodox belief, and is
adorned with evergreen leafage, I mean, actions pleasing to God. For
through the Holy Scriptures we are trained to action that is pleasing to
God, and untroubled contemplation. For in these we find both exhortation
to every virtue and dissuasion from every vice. If, therefore, we are
lovers of learning, we shall also be learned in many things. For by care
and toil and the grace of God the Giver, all things are accomplished.
*For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and
to him that knocketh it shall be opened* <span
id="fr_2519"></span>[2520](#fn_2519.md) . Wherefore let us knock at that
very fair garden of the Scriptures, so fragrant and sweet and blooming,
with its varied sounds of spiritual and divinely-inspired birds ringing
all round our ears, laying hold of our hearts, comforting the mourner,
pacifying the angry and filling him with joy everlasting: which sets our
mind on the gold-gleaming, brilliant back of the divine dove <span
id="fr_2520"></span>[2521](#fn_2520.md) , whose bright pinions bear up to
the only-begotten Son and Heir of the Husbandman <span
id="fr_2521"></span>[2522](#fn_2521.md) of that spiritual Vineyard and
bring us through Him to the Father of Lights <span
id="fr_2522"></span>[2523](#fn_2522.md) . But let us not knock carelessly
but rather zealously and constantly: lest knocking we grow weary. For
thus it will be opened to us. If we read once or twice and do not
understand what we read, let us not grow weary, but let us persist, let
us talk much, let us enquire. For *ask thy Father*, he saith, *and He
will shew thee: thy elders and they will tell thee* <span
id="fr_2523"></span>[2524](#fn_2523.md) . For *there is not in every man
that knowledge* <span id="fr_2524"></span>[2525](#fn_2524.md) . Let us draw
of the fountain of the garden perennial and purest waters springing into
life eternal <span id="fr_2525"></span>[2526](#fn_2525.md) . Here let us
luxuriate, let us revel insatiate: for the Scriptures possess
inexhaustible grace. But if we are able to pluck anything profitable
from outside sources, there is nothing to forbid that. Let us become
tried money-dealers, heaping up the true and pure gold and discarding
the spurious. Let us keep the fairest sayings but let us throw to the
dogs absurd gods and strange myths: for we might prevail most mightily
against them through themselves.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvii-p17"></span>Observe, further <span
id="fr_2526"></span>[2527](#fn_2526.md) , that there are two and twenty
books of the Old Testament, one for each letter of the Hebrew tongue.
For there are twenty-two letters of which five are double, and so they
come to be twenty-seven. For the letters Caph, Mem, Nun, Pe <span
id="fr_2527"></span>[2528](#fn_2527.md) , Sade are double. And thus the
number of the books in this way is twenty-two, but is found to be
twenty-seven because of the double character of five. For Ruth is joined
on to Judges, and the Hebrews count them one book: the first and second
books of Kings are counted one: and so are the third and fourth books of
Kings: and also the first and second of Paraleipomena: and the first and
second of Esdra. In this way, then, the books are collected together in
four Pentateuchs and two others remain over, to form thus the canonical
books. Five of them are of the Law, viz. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers, Deuteronomy. This which is the code of the Law, constitutes the
first Pentateuch. Then comes another Pentateuch, the so-called
Grapheia <span id="fr_2528"></span>[2529](#fn_2528.md) , or as they are
called by some, the Hagiographa, which are the following: Jesus the Son
of Nave <span id="fr_2529"></span>[2530](#fn_2529.md) , Judges along with
Ruth, first and second Kings, which are one book, third and fourth
Kings, which are one book, and the two books of the Paraleipomena <span
id="fr_2530"></span>[2531](#fn_2530.md) which are one book. This is the
second Pentateuch. The third Pentateuch is the books in verse, viz. Job,
Psalms, Proverbs of Solomon, Ecclesiastes of Solomon and the Song of
Songs of Solomon. The fourth Pentateuch is the Prophetical books, viz
the twelve prophets constituting one book, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,
Daniel. Then come the two books of Esdra made into one, and Esther <span
id="fr_2531"></span>[2532](#fn_2531.md) . There <span id="page_90b">p.
90b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iv.xvii-Page_90b"></span>are also the
Panaretus, that is the Wisdom of Solomon, and the Wisdom of Jesus, which
was published in Hebrew by the father of Sirach, and afterwards
translated into Greek by his grandson, Jesus, the Son of Sirach. These
are virtuous and noble, but are not counted nor were they placed in the
ark.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvii-p24"></span>The New Testament contains four
gospels, that according to Matthew, that according to Mark, that
according to Luke, that according to John: the Acts of the Holy Apostles
by Luke the Evangelist: seven catholic epistles, viz. one of James, two
of Peter, three of John, one of Jude: fourteen letters of the Apostle
Paul: the Revelation of John the Evangelist: the Canons <span
id="fr_2532"></span>[2533](#fn_2532.md) of the holy apostles <span
id="fr_2533"></span>[2534](#fn_2533.md) , by Clement.
