<span id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*In reply to those
who ask whether <span id="fr_2030"></span>[2031](#fn_2030.md) the natures
of the Lord are brought under a continuous or a discontinuous
quantity <span id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031.md) .*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p4"></span>If any one asks concerning the
natures of the Lord if they are brought under a continuous or
discontinuous quantity <span id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032.md) , we
will say that the natures of the Lord are neither one body nor one
superficies <span id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033.md) , nor one line,
nor time, nor place, so as to be reduced to a continuous quantity. For
these are the things that are reckoned continuously.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p7"></span>Further note that number deals with
things that differ, and it is quite impossible to enumerate things that
differ from one another in no respect: and just so far as they differ
are they enumerated: for instance, Peter and Paul are not counted
separately in so far as they are one. For since they are one in respect
of their essence they cannot be spoken of as two natures, but as they
differ in respect of subsistence they are spoken of as two subsistences.
So that number deals with differences, and just as the differing objects
differ from one another so far they are enumerated.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p8"></span>The natures of the Lord, then, are
united without confusion so far as regards subsistence, and they are
divided without separation according to the method and manner of
difference. And it is not according to the manner in which they are
united that they are enumerated, for it is not in respect of subsistence
that we hold that there are two natures of Christ: but according to the
manner in which they are divided without separation they are enumerated,
for it is in respect of the method and manner of difference that there
are two natures of Christ. For being united in subsistence and
permeating one another, they are united without confusion, each
preserving throughout its own peculiar and natural difference. Hence,
since they are enumerated according to the manner of difference, and
that alone, they must be brought under a discontinuous quantity.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p9"></span>Christ, therefore <span
id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034.md) , is one, perfect God and perfect
man: and Him we worship along with the Father and the Spirit, with one
obeisance, adoring even His immaculate flesh and not holding that the
flesh is not meet for worship: for in fact it is worshipped in the one
subsistence of the Word, which indeed became subsistence for it. But in
this we do not do homage to that which is created. For we worship Him,
not as mere flesh, but as flesh united with divinity, and because His
two natures are brought under the one person and one subsistence of God
the Word. I fear to touch coal because of the fire bound up with the
wood. I worship the twofold nature of Christ because of the divinity
that is in Him bound up with flesh. For I do not <span id="page_53b">p.
53b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iii.viii-Page_53b"></span>introduce a fourth
person <span id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035.md) into the Trinity. God
forbid! but I confess one person of God the Word and of His flesh, and
the Trinity remains Trinity, even after the incarnation of the Word.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p12"></span>*In reply* <span
id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036.md) *to those who ask whether the two
natures are brought under a continuous or a discontinuous quantity.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.viii-p14"></span>The natures of the Lord are
neither one body nor one superficies, nor one line, nor place, nor time,
so as to be brought under a continuous quantity: for these are the
things that are reckoned continuously. But the natures of the Lord are
united without confusion in respect of subsistence, and are divided
without separation according to the method and manner of difference. And
according to the manner in which they are united they are not
enumerated. For we do not say that the natures of Christ are two
subsistences or two in respect of subsistence. But according to the
manner in which they are divided without division, are they enumerated.
For there are two natures according to the method and manner of
difference. For being united in subsistence and permeating one another
they are united without confusion, neither having been changed into the
other, but each preserving its own natural difference even after the
union. For that which is created remained created, and that which is
uncreated, uncreated. By the manner of difference, then, and in that
alone, they are enumerated, and thus are brought under discontinuous
quantity. For things which differ from each other in no respect cannot
be enumerated, but just so far as they differ are they enumerated; for
instance, Peter and Paul are not enumerated in those respects in which
they are one: for being one in respect of their essence they are not two
natures nor are they so spoken of. But inasmuch as they differ in
subsistence they are spoken of as two subsistences. So that difference
is the cause of number.
