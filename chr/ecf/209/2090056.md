creation.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.v-p2"></span>Our God Himself, Whom we glorify as
Three in One, *created the heaven and the earth and all that they
contain* <span id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681.md) , and brought all
things out of nothing into being: some He made out of no pre-existing
basis of matter, such as heaven, earth, air, fire, water: and the rest
out of these elements that He had created, such as living creatures,
plants, seeds. For these are made up of earth, and water, and air, and
fire, at the bidding of the Creator.
