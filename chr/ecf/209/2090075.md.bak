<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—*Concerning what is
Voluntary and what is Involuntary.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiv-p2"></span>The voluntary <span
id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867.md) implies a certain definite action,
and so-called involuntariness also implies a certain definite action.
Further, many attribute true involuntariness not only to suffering, but
even to action. We must then understand action to be rational energy.
Actions are followed by praise or blame, and some of them are
accompanied with pleasure and others with pain; some are to be desired
by the actor, others are to be shunned: further, of those that are
desirable, some are always so, others only at some particular time. And
so it is also with those that are to be shunned. Again, some actions
enlist pity and are pardonable, others are hateful and deserve
punishment. Voluntariness, then, is assuredly followed by praise or
blame, and renders the action pleasurable and desirable to the actor,
either for all time or for the moment of its performance.
Involuntariness, on the other hand, brings merited pity or pardon in its
train, and renders the act painful and unde<span id="page_39b">p.
39b</span> <span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiv-Page_39b"></span>sirable to the
doer, and makes him leave it in a state of incompleteness even though
force is brought to bear upon him.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiv-p4"></span>Further, what is involuntary,
depends in part on force and in part on ignorance. It depends on force
when the creative beginning in cause is from without, that is to say,
when one is forced by another without being at all persuaded, or when
one does not contribute to the act on one’s own impulse, or does not
co-operate at all, or do on one’s own account that which is exacted by
force <span id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868.md) . Thus we may give this
definition: “An involuntary act is one in which the beginning is from
without, and where one does not contribute at all on one’s own impulse
to that which one is forced.” And by beginning we mean the creative
cause. All involuntary act depends, on the other hand, on ignorance,
when one is not the cause of the ignorance one’s self, but events just
so happen. For, if one commits murder while drunk, it is an act of
ignorance, but yet not involuntary <span
id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869.md) : for one was one’s self
responsible for the cause of the ignorance, that is to say, the
drunkenness. But if while shooting at the customary range one slew one’s
father who happened to be passing by, this would be termed an ignorant
and involuntary act.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiv-p7"></span>As, then, that which is involuntary
is in two parts, one depending on force, the other on ignorance, that
which is voluntary is the opposite of both. For that which is voluntary
is the result neither of force nor of ignorance <span
id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870.md) . A voluntary act, then, is one of
which the beginning or cause originates in an actor, who knows each
individual circumstance through which and in which the action takes
place. By “individual” is meant what the rhetoricians call
circumstantial elements: for instance, the actor, the sufferer, the
action (perchance a murder), the instrument, the place, the time, the
manner, the reason of the action.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiv-p9"></span>Notice that there are certain things
that occupy a place intermediate between what is voluntary and what is
involuntary. Although they are unpleasant and painful we welcome them as
the escape from a still greater trouble; for instance, to escape
shipwreck we cast the cargo overboard <span
id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiv-p11"></span>Notice also that children and
irrational creatures perform voluntary actions, but these do not involve
the exercise of choice: further, all our actions that are done in anger
and without previous deliberation are voluntary actions, but do not in
the least involve free choice <span id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md)
. Also, if a friend suddenly appears on the scene, or if one
unexpectedly lights on a treasure, so far as we are concerned it is
quite voluntary, but there is no question of choice in the matter. For
all these things are voluntary, because we desire pleasure from them,
but they do not by any means imply choice, because they are not the
result of deliberation. And deliberation must assuredly precede choice,
as we have said above.
