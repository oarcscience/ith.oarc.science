<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*Concerning
Energy.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiii-p2"></span>All the faculties <span
id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md) we have already discussed, both
those of knowledge and those of life, both the natural and the
artificial, are, it is to be noted, called energies. For energy <span
id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md) is the natural force and activity
of each essence: or again, natural energy is the activity innate in
every essence: and so, clearly, things that have the same essence have
also the same energy, and things that have different natures have also
different energies. For no essence can be devoid of natural energy.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiii-p5"></span>Natural energy again is the force
in each essence by which its nature is made manifest. And again: natural
energy is the primal, eternally-moving force of the intelligent soul:
that is, the eternally-moving word of the soul, which ever springs
naturally from it. And yet again: natural energy <span
id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) is the force and activity of each
essence which only that which is not lacks.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiii-p7"></span>But actions <span
id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md) are also called energies: for
instance, speaking, eating, drinking, and such like. The natural
affections <span id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) also are often
called energies, for instance, hunger, thirst, and so forth <span
id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865.md) . And yet again, the result of the
force is also often called energy.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiii-p11"></span>Things are spoken of in a twofold
way as being potential and actual. For we say that the child at the
breast is a potential scholar, for he is so equipped that, if taught, he
will become a scholar. Further, we speak of a potential and an actual
scholar, meaning that the latter is versed in letters, while the former
has the power of interpreting letters, but does not put it into actual
use: again, when we speak of an actual scholar, we mean that he puts his
power into actual use, that is to say, that he really interprets
writings.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiii-p12"></span>It is, therefore, to be observed
that in the second sense potentiality and actuality go together; for the
scholar is in the one case potential, and in the other actual.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiii-p13"></span>The primal and only true energy of
nature is the voluntary or rational and independent life which
constitutes our humanity. I know not how those who rob the Lord of this
can say that He became man <span id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxiii-p15"></span>Energy is drastic activity of
nature: and by drastic is meant that which is moved of itself.
