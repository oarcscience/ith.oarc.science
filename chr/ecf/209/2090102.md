<span id="iii.iv.iii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*Concerning the
natural and innocent passions* <span
id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xx-p3"></span>We confess <span
id="fr_2203"></span>[2204](#fn_2203) ,then, that He assumed all the
natural and innocent passions of man. For He assumed the whole man and
all man’s attributes save sin. For that is not natural, nor is it
implanted in us by the Creator, but arises voluntarily in our mode of
life as the result of a further implantation by the devil, though it
cannot prevail over us by force. For the natural and innocent passions
are those which are not in our power, but which have entered into the
life of man owing to the condemnation by reason of the transgression;
such as hunger, thirst, weariness, labour, the tears, the corruption,
the shrinking from death, the fear, the agony with the bloody sweat, the
succour at the hands of angels because of the weakness of the nature,
and other such like passions which belong by nature to every man.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xx-p5"></span>All, then, He assumed that He might
sanctify all. He was tried and overcame in order that He might prepare
victory for us and give to nature power to overcome its antagonist, in
order that nature which was overcome of old might overcome its former
conqueror by the very weapons wherewith it had itself been overcome.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xx-p6"></span>The wicked one <span
id="fr_2204"></span>[2205](#fn_2204) , then, made his assault from
without, not by thoughts prompted inwardly, just as it was with Adam.
For it was not by inward thoughts, but by the serpent that Adam was
assailed. But the Lord repulsed the assault and dispelled it like
vapour, in order that the passions which assailed him and were overcome
might be easily subdued by us, and that the new Adam should save the
old.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xx-p8"></span><span id="page_69b">p. 69b</span>
<span id="iii.iv.iii.xx-Page_69b"></span>Of a truth our natural passions
were in harmony with nature and above nature in Christ. For they were
stirred in Him after a natural manner when He permitted the flesh to
suffer what was proper to it: but they were above nature because that
which was natural did not in the Lord assume command over the will. For
no compulsion is contemplated in Him but all is voluntary. For it was
with His will that He hungered and thirsted and feared and died.
