<span id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX</span>.—*That God* <span
id="fr_2606"></span>[2607](#fn_2606) *is not the cause of evils.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p3"></span>It is to be observed <span
id="fr_2607"></span>[2608](#fn_2607) that it is the custom in the Holy
Scripture to speak of God’s permission as His energy, as when the
apostle says in the Epistle to the Romans, *Hath not the potter power
over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and
another unto dishonour* <span id="fr_2608"></span>[2609](#fn_2608) *?*
And for this reason, that He Himself makes this or that. For He is
Himself alone the Maker of all things; yet it is not He Himself that
fashions noble or ignoble things, but the personal choice of <span
id="page_93b">p. 93b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xix-Page_93b"></span>each one <span
id="fr_2609"></span>[2610](#fn_2609) . And this is manifest from what
the same Apostle says in the Second Epistle to Timothy, *In a great
house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood
and of earth: and some to honour and some to dishonour. If a man
therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour
sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good
work* <span id="fr_2610"></span>[2611](#fn_2610) . And it is evident
that the purification must be voluntary: for *if a man*, he saith,
*purge himself.* And the consequent antistrophe responds, “If a man
purge not himself he will be a vessel to dishonour, unmeet for the
master’s use and fit only to be broken in pieces.” Wherefore this
passage that we have quoted and this, *God hath concluded them all in
unbelief* <span id="fr_2611"></span>[2612](#fn_2611) , and this, *God
hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see,
and ears that they should not hear* <span
id="fr_2612"></span>[2613](#fn_2612) , all these must be understood not
as though God Himself were energising, but as though God were
permitting, both because of free-will and because goodness knows no
compulsion.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p10"></span>His permission, therefore, is
usually spoken of in the Holy Scripture as His energy and work. Nay,
even when He says that *God creates evil things*, and that *there is no
evil in a city that the Lord hath not done*, he does not mean by these
words <span id="fr_2613"></span>[2614](#fn_2613) that the Lord is the
cause of evil, but the word ‘evil <span
id="fr_2614"></span>[2615](#fn_2614) ’ is used in two ways, with two
meanings. For sometimes it means what is evil by nature, and this is the
opposite of virtue and the will of God: and sometimes it means that
which is evil and oppressive to our sensation, that is to say,
afflictions and calamities. Now these are seemingly evil because they
are painful, but in reality are good. For to those who understand they
became ambassadors of conversion and salvation. The Scripture says that
of these God is the Author.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p13"></span>It is, moreover, to be observed that
of these, too, we are the cause: for involuntary evils are the offspring
of voluntary ones <span id="fr_2615"></span>[2616](#fn_2615) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xix-p15"></span>This also should be recognised, that
it is usual in the Scriptures for some things that ought to be
considered as effects to be stated in a causal sense <span
id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616) , as, *Against Thee, Thee only,
have I sinned and done this evil in Thy sight, that Thou mightest be
justified when Thou speakest, and prevail when Thou judgest* <span
id="fr_2617"></span>[2618](#fn_2617) . For the sinner did not sin in
order that God might prevail, nor again did God require our sin in order
that He might by it be revealed as victor <span
id="fr_2618"></span>[2619](#fn_2618) . For above comparison He wins the
victor’s prize against all, even against those who are sinless, being
Maker, incomprehensible, uncreated, and possessing natural and not
adventitious glory. But it is because when we sin God is not unjust in
His anger against us; and when He pardons the penitent He is shewn
victor over our wickedness. But it is not for this that we sin, but
because the thing so turns out. It is just as if one were sitting at
work and a friend stood near by, and one said, My friend came in order
that I might do no work that day. The friend, however, was not present
in order that the man should do no work, but such was the result. For
being occupied with receiving his friend he did not work. These things,
too, are spoken of as effects because affairs so turned out. Moreover,
God does not wish that He alone should be just, but that all should, so
far as possible, be made like unto Him.
