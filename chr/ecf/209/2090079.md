id="iii.iv.ii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII</span>.—*Concerning
what is not in our hands.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxviii-p2"></span>Of things that are not in our
hands some have their beginning or cause in those that are in our power,
that is to say, the recompenses of our actions both in the present and
in the age to come, but all the rest are dependent on the divine will.
For the origin of all things is from God, but their destruction has been
introduced by our wickedness for our punishment or benefit. For God did
not create death, neither does He take delight in the destruction of
living things <span id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885.md) . But death is
the work rather of man, that is, its origin is in Adam’s transgression,
in like manner as all other punishments. But all other things must be
referred to God. For our birth is to be referred to His creative power;
and our continuance to His conservative power; and our government and
safety to His providential power; and the eternal enjoyment of good
things by those who preserve the laws of nature in which we are formed
is to be ascribed to His goodness. But since some deny the existence of
Providence, let us further devote a few words to the discussion of
Providence.
