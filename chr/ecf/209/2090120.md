<span id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*How the
Only-begotten Son of God is called first-born.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.viii-p2"></span>He who is first begotten is called
first-born <span id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280) , whether he is
only-begotten or the first of a number of brothers. If then the Son of
God was called first-born, but was not called Only-begotten, we could
imagine that He was the first-born of creatures, as being a
creature <span id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281) . But since He is
called both first-born and Only-begotten, both senses must be preserved
in His case. We say that He is first-born of all creation <span
id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282) since both He Himself is of God and
creation is of God, but as He Himself is born alone and timelessly of
the essence of God the Father, He may with reason be called
Only-begotten Son, first-born and not first-created. For the creation
was not brought into being out of the essence of the Father, but by His
will out of nothing <span id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283) . And He
is called First-born among many brethren <span
id="fr_2284"></span>[2285](#fn_2284) , for although being Only-begotten,
He was also born of a mother. Since, indeed, He participated just as we
ourselves do in blood and flesh and became man, while we too through Him
became sons of God, being adopted through the baptism, He Who is by
nature Son of God became first-born amongst us who were made by adoption
and grace sons of God, and stand to Him in the relation of brothers.
Wherefore He said, *I ascend unto My Father and your Father* <span
id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285) . He did not say “our Father,” but
“My Father,” clearly in the sense of Father by nature, and “your
Father,” in the sense of Father by grace. And “My God and your God <span
id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286) .” He did not say “our God,” but
“My God:” and if you distinguish with subtle thought that which is seen
from that which is thought, also “your God,” as Maker and Lord.
