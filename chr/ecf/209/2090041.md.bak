<span id="iii.iv.i.v-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*Proof that God is one and
not many.*

<span id="iii.iv.i.v-p2"></span>We have, then, adequately demonstrated
that there is a God, and that His essence is incomprehensible. But that
God is one <span id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md) and not many is no
matter of doubt to those who believe in the Holy Scriptures. For the
Lord says in the beginning of the Law: *I am the Lord thy God, which
have brought thee out of the land of Egypt. Thou shalt have no other
Gods before Me* <span id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) . And again
He says, *Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord* <span
id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454.md) . And in Isaiah the prophet we
read, *For I am the first God and I am the last, and beside Me there is
no God. Before Me there was not any God, nor after Me will there be any
God, and beside Me there is no God* <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md) . And the Lord, too, in the holy
gospels speaketh these words to His Father, *And this is life eternal,
that they may know Thee the only true God* <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456.md) . But with those that do not
believe in the Holy Scriptures we will reason thus.

<span id="iii.iv.i.v-p8"></span>The Deity is perfect <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457.md) , and without blemish in goodness,
and wisdom, and power, without beginning, without end, everlasting,
uncircumscribed <span id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458.md) , and in
short, perfect in all things. Should we say, then, that there are many
Gods, we must recognise difference among the many. For if there is no
difference among them, they are one rather than many. But if there is
difference among them, what becomes of the perfectness? For that which
comes short of perfection, whether it be in goodness, or power, or
wisdom, or time, or place, could not be God. But it is this very
identity in all respects that shews that the Deity is one and not
many <span id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.v-p12"></span>Again, if there are many Gods, how can
one maintain that God is uncircumscribed? For where the one would be,
the other could not be <span id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.v-p14"></span>Further, how could the world be
governed by many and saved from dissolution and destruction, while
strife is seen to rage between the rulers? For difference introduces
strife <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) . And if any one
should say that each rules over a part, what of that which established
this order and gave to each his particular realm? For this would the
rather be God. Therefore, God is one, perfect, uncircumscribed, maker of
the universe, and its preserver and governor, exceeding and preceding
all perfection.

<span id="iii.iv.i.v-p16"></span>Moreover, it is a natural necessity
that duality should originate in unity <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md) .
