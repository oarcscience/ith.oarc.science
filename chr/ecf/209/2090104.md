<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*Concerning His
growth.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxii-p2"></span>He is, moreover, said to grow in
wisdom and age and grace <span id="fr_2211"></span>[2212](#fn_2211.md) ,
increasing in age indeed and through the increase in age manifesting the
wisdom that is in Him <span id="fr_2212"></span>[2213](#fn_2212.md) ; yea,
further, making men’s progress in wisdom and grace, and the fulfilment
of the Father’s goodwill, that is to say, men’s knowledge of God and
men’s salvation, His own increase, and everywhere taking as His own that
which is ours. But those who hold that He progressed in wisdom and grace
in the sense of receiving some addition to these attributes, do not say
that the union took place at the first origin of the flesh, nor yet do
they give precedence to the union in subsistence, but giving heed <span
id="fr_2213"></span>[2214](#fn_2213.md) to the foolish Nestorius they
imagine some strange relative union and mere indwelling, *understanding
neither what they say nor whereof they affirm* <span
id="fr_2214"></span>[2215](#fn_2214.md) . For if in truth the flesh was
united with God the Word from its first origin, or rather if it existed
in Him and was identical in subsistence with Him, how was it that it was
not endowed completely with all wisdom and grace? not that it might
itself participate in the grace, nor share by grace in what belonged to
the Word, but rather by reason of the union in subsistence, since both
what is human and <span id="page_70b">p. 70b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii.xxii-Page_70b"></span>what is divine belong to the one
Christ, and that He Who was Himself at once God and man should pour
forth like a fountain over the universe His grace and wisdom and
plenitude of every blessing.
