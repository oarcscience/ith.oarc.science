<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*Concerning the
properties of the two Natures.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xiii-p2"></span>Confessing, then, the same Jesus
Christ, our Lord, to be perfect God and perfect man, we hold that the
same has all the attributes of the Father save that of being ingenerate,
and all the attributes of the first Adam, save only his sin, these
attributes being body and the intelligent and rational soul; and further
that He has, corresponding to the two natures, the two sets of natural
qualities belonging to the two natures: two natural volitions, one
divine and one human, two natural energies, one divine and one human,
two natural free-wills, one divine and one human, and two kinds of
wisdom and knowledge, one divine and one human. For being of like
essence with God and the Father, He wills and energises freely as God,
and being also of like essence with us He likewise wills and energises
freely as man. For His are the miracles and His also are the passive
states.
