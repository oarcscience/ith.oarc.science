<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*Concerning the
holy and immaculate Mysteries of the Lord.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p2"></span>God <span
id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390.md) Who is good and altogether good and
more than good, Who is goodness throughout, by reason of the exceeding
riches of His goodness did not suffer Himself, that is His nature, only
to be good, with no other to participate therein, but because of this He
made first the spiritual and heavenly powers: next the visible and
sensible universe: next man with his spiritual and sentient nature. All
things, therefore, which he made, share in His goodness in respect of
their existence. For He Himself is existence to all, since all things
that are, are in Him <span id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391.md) , not
only because it was He that brought them out of nothing into being, but
because His energy preserves and maintains all that He made: and in
especial the living creatures. For both in that they exist and in that
they <span id="page_82b">p. 82b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-Page_82b"></span>enjoy life they share in His
goodness. But in truth those of them that have reason have a still
greater share in that, both because of what has been already said and
also because of the very reason which they possess. For they are somehow
more dearly akin to Him, even though He is incomparably higher than
they.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p5"></span>Man, however, being endowed with
reason and free will, received the power of continuous union with God
through his own choice, if indeed he should abide in goodness, that is
in obedience to his Maker. Since, however, he transgressed the command
of his Creator and became liable to death and corruption, the Creator
and Maker of our race, because of His bowels of compassion, took on our
likeness, becoming man in all things but without sin, and was united to
our nature <span id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392.md) . For since He
bestowed on us His own image and His own spirit and we did not keep them
safe, He took Himself a share in our poor and weak nature, in order that
He might cleanse us and make us incorruptible, and establish us once
more as partakers of His divinity.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p7"></span>For it was fitting that not only the
first-fruits of our nature should partake in the higher good but every
man who wished it, and that a second birth should take place and that
the nourishment should be new and suitable to the birth and thus the
measure of perfection be attained. Through His birth, that is, His
incarnation, and baptism and passion and resurrection, He delivered our
nature from the sin of our first parent and death and corruption, and
became the first-fruits of the resurrection, and made Himself the way
and image and pattern, in order that we, too, following in His
footsteps, may become by adoption what He is Himself by nature <span
id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393.md) , sons and heirs of God and joint
heirs with Him <span id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394.md) . He gave us
therefore, as I said, a second birth in order that, just as we who are
born of Adam are in his image and are the heirs of the curse and
corruption, so also being born of Him we may be in His likeness and
heirs <span id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395.md) of His incorruption and
blessing and glory.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p11"></span>Now seeing that this Adam is
spiritual, it was meet that both the birth and likewise the food should
be spiritual too, but since we are of a double and compound nature, it
is meet that both the birth should be double and likewise the food
compound. We were therefore given a birth by water and Spirit: I mean,
by the holy baptism <span id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396.md) : and the
food is the very bread of life, our Lord Jesus Christ, Who came down
from heaven <span id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397.md) . For when He was
about to take on Himself a voluntary death for our sakes, on the night
on which He gave Himself up, He laid a new covenant on His holy
disciples and apostles, and through them on all who believe on Him. In
the upper chamber, then, of holy and illustrious Sion, after He had
eaten the ancient Passover with His disciples and had fulfilled the
ancient covenant, He washed His disciples’ feet <span
id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398.md) in token of the holy baptism. Then
having broken bread He gave it to them saying, *Take, eat, this is My
body broken for you for the remission of sins* <span
id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399.md) . Likewise also He took the cup of
wine and water and gave it to them saying, *Drink ye all of it: for this
is My blood, the blood of the New Testament which is shed for you for
the remission of sins. This do ye in remembrance of Me. For as often as
ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do shew the death of the Son of
man and confess His resurrection until He come* <span
id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p17"></span>If then the Word of God is quick
and energising <span id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401.md) , and the Lord
did all that He willed <span id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402.md) ; if
He said, Let there be light and there was light, let there be a
firmament and there was a firmament <span
id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403.md) ; if the heavens were established
by the Word of the Lord and all the host of them by the breath of His
mouth <span id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404.md) ; if the heaven and the
earth, water and fire and air and the whole glory of these, and, in
sooth, this most noble creature, man, were perfected by the Word of the
Lord; if God the Word of His own will became man and the pure and
undefiled blood of the holy and ever-virginal One made His flesh without
the aid of seed <span id="fr_2405"></span>[2406](#fn_2405.md) , can He not
then make the bread His body and the wine and water His blood? He said
in the beginning, *Let the earth bring forth grass* <span
id="fr_2406"></span>[2407](#fn_2406.md) , and even until this present day,
when the rain comes it brings forth its proper fruits, urged on and
strengthened by the divine command. God said, *This is My body*, and
*This is My blood, and this do ye in remembrance of Me*. And so it is at
His omnipotent command *until He come:* for it was in this sense that He
said until He come: and the overshadowing power of the Holy Spirit
becomes through the invocation the rain to this new tillage <span
id="fr_2407"></span>[2408](#fn_2407.md) . For just as God made all that He
made by the energy of the Holy Spirit, so also now the energy of the
<span id="page_83b">p. 83b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-Page_83b"></span>Spirit performs those things that
are supernatural and which it is not possible to comprehend unless by
faith alone. *How shall this be*, said the holy Virgin, *seeing I know
not a man?* And the archangel Gabriel answered her: *The Holy Spirit
shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
thee* <span id="fr_2408"></span>[2409](#fn_2408.md) . And now you ask, how
the bread became Christ’s body and the wine and water Christ’s blood.
And I say unto thee, “The Holy Spirit is present and does those things
which surpass reason and thought.”

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p26"></span>Further, bread and wine <span
id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409.md) are employed: for God knoweth man’s
infirmity: for in general man turns away discontentedly from what is not
well-worn by custom: and so with His usual indulgence He performs His
supernatural works through familiar objects: and just as, in the case of
baptism, since it is man’s custom to wash himself with water and anoint
himself with oil, He connected the grace of the Spirit with the oil and
the water and made it the water of regeneration, in like manner since it
is man’s custom to eat and to drink water and wine <span
id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410.md) , He connected His divinity with
these and made them His body and blood in order that we may rise to what
is supernatural through what is familiar and natural.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p29"></span>The body which is born of the holy
Virgin is in truth body united with divinity, not that the body which
was received up into the heavens descends, but that the bread itself and
the wine are changed into God’s body and blood <span
id="fr_2411"></span>[2412](#fn_2411.md) . But if you enquire how this
happens, it is enough for you to learn that it was through the Holy
Spirit, just as the Lord took on Himself flesh that subsisted in Him and
was born of the holy Mother of God through the Spirit. And we know
nothing further save that the Word of God is true and energises and is
omnipotent, but the manner of this cannot be searched out <span
id="fr_2412"></span>[2413](#fn_2412.md) . But one can put it well thus,
that just as in nature the bread by the eating and the wine and the
water by the drinking are changed into the body and blood of the eater
and drinker, and do not <span id="fr_2413"></span>[2414](#fn_2413.md)
become a different body from the former one, so the bread of the
table <span id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414.md) and the wine and water
are supernaturally changed by the invocation and presence of the Holy
Spirit into the body and blood of Christ, and are not two but one <span
id="fr_2415"></span>[2416](#fn_2415.md) and the same.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p35"></span>Wherefore to those who partake
worthily with faith, it is for the remission of sins and for life
everlasting and for the safeguarding of soul and body; but to those who
partake unworthily without faith, it is for chastisement and punishment,
just as also the death of the Lord became to those who believe life and
incorruption for the enjoyment of eternal blessedness, while to those
who do not believe and to the murderers of the Lord it is for
everlasting chastisement and punishment.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p36"></span>The bread and the wine are not
merely figures of the body and blood of Christ (God forbid!) but the
deified body of the Lord itself: for the Lord has said, “This is My
body,” not, this is a figure of My body: and “My blood,” not, a figure
of My blood. And on a previous occasion He had said to the Jews, *Except
ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, ye have no life
in you. For My flesh is meat indeed and My blood is drink indeed.* And
again, *He that eateth Me, shall live* <span
id="fr_2416"></span>[2417](#fn_2416.md)  <span
id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p39"></span>Wherefore with all fear and a pure
conscience and certain faith let us draw near and it will assuredly be
to us as we believe, doubting nothing. Let us pay homage to it in all
purity both of soul and body: for it is twofold. Let us draw near to it
with an ardent desire, and with our hands held in the form of the
cross <span id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418.md) let us receive the body
of the Crucified One: and let us apply our eyes and lips and brows and
partake of the divine coal, in order that the fire of the longing, that
is in us, with the additional heat derived from the coal may utterly
consume our sins and illumine our hearts, and that we may be inflamed
and deified by the participation in the divine fire. Isaiah saw the
coal <span id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419.md) . But coal is not plain
wood but wood united with fire: in like manner also the bread of the
communion <span id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420.md) is not plain bread
but bread united with divinity. But a body <span
id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421.md) which is united with divinity is
not one nature, but has one nature belonging to the body and another
belonging to the divinity that is united to it, so that the compound is
not one nature but two.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p44"></span>With bread and wine Melchisedek,
the priest of the most high God, received Abraham on his return from the
slaughter of the Gentiles <span id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422.md) .
That table pre-imaged this mystical table, just as that priest was a
type and image of Christ, the true high-priest <span
id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423.md) . *For thou art a priest for ever
after the order of Melchisedek* <span
id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424.md) . Of this <span id="page_84b">p.
84b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-Page_84b"></span>bread the
show-bread was an image <span id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425.md) .
This surely is that pure and bloodless sacrifice which the Lord through
the prophet said is offered to Him from the rising to the setting of the
sun <span id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p50"></span>The body and blood of Christ are
making for the support of our soul and body, without being consumed or
suffering corruption, not making for the draught (God forbid!) but for
our being and preservation, a protection against all kinds of injury, a
purging from all uncleanness: should one receive base gold, they purify
it by the critical burning lest in the future we be condemned with this
world. They purify from diseases and all kinds of calamities; according
to the words of the divine Apostle <span
id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427.md) , *For if we would judge ourselves,
we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the
Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world*. This too is what
he says, *So that he that partaketh of the body and blood of Christ
unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself* <span
id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428.md) . Being purified by this, we are
united to the body of Christ and to His Spirit and become the body of
Christ.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p53"></span>This bread is the
first-fruits <span id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429.md) of the future
bread which is <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p54.1"></span>ἐπιούσιος</span>, i.e. necessary for
existence. For the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p54.2"></span>ἐπιούσιον</span> signifies either the
future, that is Him Who is for a future age, or else Him of Whom we
partake for the preservation of our essence. Whether then it is in this
sense or that, it is fitting to speak so of the Lord’s body. For the
Lord’s flesh is life-giving spirit because it was conceived of the
life-giving Spirit. For what is born of the Spirit is spirit. But I do
not say this to take away the nature of the body, but I wish to make
clear its life-giving and divine power <span
id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p56"></span>But if some persons called the
bread and the wine antitypes <span id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431.md)
of the body and blood of the Lord, as did the divinely inspired Basil,
they said so not after the consecration but before the consecration, so
calling the offering itself.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p58"></span>Participation is spoken of; for
through it we partake of the divinity of Jesus. Communion, too, is
spoken of, and it is an actual communion, because through it we have
communion with Christ and share in His flesh and His divinity: yea, we
have communion and are united with one another through it. For since we
partake of one bread, we all become one body of Christ and one blood,
and members one of another, being of one body with Christ.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p59"></span>With all our strength, therefore,
let us beware lest we receive communion from or grant it to heretics;
*Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, saith the Lord, neither cast
ye your pearls before swine* <span id="fr_2432"></span>[2433](#fn_2432.md)
, lest we become partakers in their dishonour and condemnation. For if
union is in truth with Christ and with one another, we are assuredly
voluntarily united also with all those who partake with us. For this
union is effected voluntarily and not against our inclination. *For we
are all one body because we partake of the one bread*, as the divine
Apostle says <span id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xiii-p62"></span>Further, antitypes of future things
are spoken of, not as though they were not in reality Christ’s body and
blood, but that now through them we partake of Christ’s divinity, while
then we shall partake mentally <span
id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434.md) through the vision alone.
