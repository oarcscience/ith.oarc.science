<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—*Concerning our
Lord’s Praying.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxiv-p2"></span>Prayer is an uprising of the mind
to God or a petitioning of God for what is fitting. How then did it
happen that our Lord offered up prayer in the case of Lazarus, and at
the hour of His passion? For His holy mind was in no need either of any
uprising towards God, since it had been once and for all united in
subsistence with the God Word, or of any petitioning of God. For Christ
is one. But it was because He appropriated to Himself our personality
and took our impress on Himself, and became an ensample for us, and
taught us to ask of God and strain towards Him, and guided us through
His own holy mind in the way that leads up to God. For just as He <span
id="fr_2218"></span>[2219](#fn_2218) endured the passion, achieving for
our sakes a triumph over it, so also He offered up prayer, guiding us,
as I said, in the way that leads up to God, and “fulfilling all
righteousness <span id="fr_2219"></span>[2220](#fn_2219) ” on our
behalf, as He said to John, and reconciling His Father to us, and
honouring Him as the beginning and cause, and proving that He is no
enemy of God. For when He said in connection with Lazarus, *Father, I
thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me. And I know that Thou hearest Me
always, but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they
may believe that Thou hast sent Me* <span
id="fr_2220"></span>[2221](#fn_2220) , is it not most manifest to all
that He said this in honour of His Father as the cause even of Himself,
and to shew that He was no enemy of God <span
id="fr_2221"></span>[2222](#fn_2221) ?

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxiv-p7"></span>Again, when he said, *Father, if it
be possible, let this cup pass from Me: yet, not as I will* <span
id="page_71b">p. 71b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii.xxiv-Page_71b"></span>*but as Thou wilt* <span
id="fr_2222"></span>[2223](#fn_2222) , is it not clear to all <span
id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223) that He said this as a lesson to us
to ask help in our trials only from God, and to prefer God’s will to our
own, and as a proof that He did actually appropriate to Himself the
attributes of our nature, and that He did in truth possess two wills,
natural, indeed, and corresponding with His natures but yet in no wise
opposed to one another? “Father” implies that He is of the same essence,
but “if it be possible” does not mean that He was in ignorance (for what
is impossible to God?), but serves to teach us to prefer God’s will to
our own. For that alone is impossible which is against God’s will and
permission <span id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224) . “But not as I
will but as Thou wilt,” for inasmuch as He is God, He is identical with
the Father, while inasmuch as He is man, He manifests the natural will
of mankind. For it is this that naturally seeks escape from death.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxiv-p11"></span>Further, these words, *My God, My
God, why hast Thou forsaken Me* <span
id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225) ? He said as making our personality
His own <span id="fr_2226"></span>[2227](#fn_2226) . For neither would
God be regarded with us as His Father, unless one were to discriminate
with subtle imaginings of the mind between that which is seen and that
which is thought, nor was He ever forsaken by His divinity: nay, it was
we who were forsaken and disregarded. So that it was as appropriating
our personality that He offered these prayers <span
id="fr_2227"></span>[2228](#fn_2227) .
