<span id="iii.iv.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*Why it was the Son of
God, and not the Father or the Spirit, that became man: and what having
became man He achieved.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.iv-p2"></span>The Father is Father <span
id="fr_2258"></span>[2259](#fn_2258.md) and not Son <span
id="fr_2259"></span>[2260](#fn_2259.md) : the Son is Son and not Father:
the Holy Spirit is Spirit and not Father or Son. For the
individuality <span id="fr_2260"></span>[2261](#fn_2260.md) is
unchangeable. How, indeed, could individuality continue to exist at all
if it were ever changing and altering? Wherefore the Son of God became
Son of Man in order that His individuality might endure. For since He
was the Son of God, He became Son of Man, being made flesh of the holy
Virgin and not losing the individuality of Sonship <span
id="fr_2261"></span>[2262](#fn_2261.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.iv-p7"></span>Further, the Son of God became man, in
order that He might again bestow on man that favour for the sake of
which He created him. For He created him after His own image, endowed
with intellect and free-will, and after His own likeness, that is to
say, perfect in all virtue so far as it is possible for man’s nature to
attain perfection. For the following properties are, so to speak, marks
of the divine nature: viz. absence of care and distraction and guile,
goodness, wisdom, justice, freedom from all vice. So then, after He had
placed man in communion with Himself (for having made him for
incorruption <span id="fr_2262"></span>[2263](#fn_2262.md) , He led him up
through communion with Himself to incorruption), and when moreover,
through the transgression of the command we had confused and obliterated
the marks of the divine image, and had become evil, we were stripped of
our communion with God (for what communion hath light with
darkness <span id="fr_2263"></span>[2264](#fn_2263) ?.md): and having been
shut out from life we became subject to the corruption of death: yea,
since He gave us to share in the better part, and we did not keep it
secure, He shares in the inferior part, I mean our own nature, in order
that through Himself and in Himself He might renew that which was made
after His image and likeness, and might teach us, too, the conduct of a
virtuous life, making through Himself the way thither easy for us, and
might by the communication of life deliver us from corruption, becoming
Himself the firstfruits of our resurrection, and might renovate the
useless and worn vessel calling us to the knowledge of God that He might
redeem us from the tyranny of the devil, and might strengthen and teach
us how to overthrow the tyrant through patience and humility <span
id="fr_2264"></span>[2265](#fn_2264.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.iv-p11"></span>The worship of demons then has
ceased: creation has been sanctified by the divine blood: altars and
temples of idols have been overthrown, the knowledge of God has been
implanted in men’s minds, the co-essential Trinity, the uncreate
divinity, one true God, Creator and Lord of all receives men’s service:
virtues are cultivated, the hope of resurrection has been granted
through the resurrection of Christ, the demons shudder at those men who
of old were under their subjection. And the marvel, indeed, is that all
this has been successfully brought about through His cross and passion
and death. Throughout all the earth the Gospel of the knowledge of God
has been preached; no wars or weapons or armies being used to rout the
enemy, but only a few, naked, poor, illiterate, persecuted and tormented
men, who with their lives in their hands, preached Him Who was crucified
in the flesh and died, and who became victors over the wise and
powerful. For the omnipotent power of the Cross accompanied them. Death
itself, which once was man’s chiefest terror, has been overthrown, and
now that which was once the object of hate and loathing is preferred to
life. These are the achievements of Christ’s presence: these are the
tokens of His power. For it was not one people that He saved, as when
through Moses He divided the sea and delivered Israel out of Egypt and
the bondage of Pharaoh <span id="fr_2265"></span>[2266](#fn_2265.md) ; nay,
rather He rescued all mankind from the corruption of death and the
bitter tyranny of sin: not leading them by force to virtue, not
overwhelming them with earth or burning them with fire, or ordering the
sinners to be stoned, but persuading men by gentleness and
long-suffering to choose virtue and vie with one another, and find
pleasure in the struggle to attain it. For, formerly, it was sinners who
were persecuted, and yet they clung all the closer to sin, and sin was
looked upon by them as their God: but now for the sake of piety and
virtue men choose persecutions and crucifixions and death.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.iv-p13"></span>Hail! O Christ, the Word and Wisdom
and Power of God, and God omnipotent! What can we helpless ones give
Thee in return for <span id="page_76b">p. 76b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.iv-Page_76b"></span>all these good gifts? For all are
Thine, and Thou askest naught from us save our salvation, Thou Who
Thyself art the Giver of this, and yet art grateful to those who receive
it, through Thy unspeakable goodness. Thanks be to Thee Who gave us
life, and granted us the grace of a happy life, and restored us to that,
when we had gone astray, through Thy unspeakable condescension.
