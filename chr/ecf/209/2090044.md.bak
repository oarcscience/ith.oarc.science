<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*Concerning the Holy
Trinity.*

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p2"></span>We believe, then, in One God, one
beginning <span id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) , having no
beginning, uncreate, unbegotten, imperishable and immortal, everlasting,
infinite, uncircumscribed, boundless, of infinite power, simple,
uncompound, incorporeal, without flux, passionless, unchangeable,
unalterable, unseen, the fountain of goodness and justice, the light of
the mind, inaccessible; a power known by no measure, measurable only by
His own will alone (for all things that He wills He can <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487) .md), creator of all created things,
seen or unseen, of all the maintainer and preserver, for all the
provider, master and lord and king over all, with an endless and
immortal kingdom: having no contrary, filling all, by nothing
encompassed, but rather Himself the encompasser and maintainer and
original possessor of the universe, occupying <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488.md) all essences intact <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md) and extending beyond all things,
and being separate from all essence as being super-essential <span
id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) and above all things and absolute
God, absolute goodness, and absolute fulness <span
id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) : determining all sovereignties and
ranks, being placed above all sovereignty and rank, above essence and
life and word and thought: being Himself very light and goodness and
life and essence, inasmuch as He does not derive His being from another,
that is to say, of those things that exist: but being Himself the
fountain of being to all that is, of life to the living, of reason to
those that have reason; to all the cause of all good: perceiving all
things even before they have become: one essence, one divinity, one
power, one will, one energy, one beginning, one authority, one dominion,
one sovereignty, made known in three perfect subsistences and adored
with one adoration, believed in and ministered to by all rational
creation <span id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) , united without
confusion and divided without separation (which indeed transcends
thought). (We believe) in Father and Son and Holy Spirit whereinto also
we have been baptized <span id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) . For
so our Lord commanded the Apostles to baptize, saying, *Baptizing them
in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit* <span
id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p12"></span>(We believe) in one Father, the
beginning <span id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md) , and cause of all:
begotten of no one: without cause or generation, alone subsisting:
creator of all: but Father of one only by nature, His Only-begotten Son
and our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ, and Producer <span
id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md) of the most Holy Spirit. And in one
Son of God, the Only-begotten, our Lord, Jesus Christ: begotten of the
Father, before all the ages: Light of Light, true God of true God:
begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father, through Whom all
things are made: and when we say He was before all the ages we shew that
His birth is without time or beginning: for the Son of God was not
brought into being out of nothing <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md) , He that is the effulgence of the
glory, the impress of the Father’s subsistence <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md) , the living wisdom and power <span
id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md) , the Word possessing interior
subsistence <span id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md) , the essential
and perfect and living image <span id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md)
of the unseen God. But always He was with the Father and in Him <span
id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502.md) , everlastingly and without
beginning begotten of Him. For there never was <span id="page_7b">p.
7b</span> <span id="iii.iv.i.viii-Page_7b"></span>a time when the Father
was and the Son was not, but always the Father and always the Son, Who
was begotten of Him, existed together. For He could not have received
the name Father apart from the Son: for if He were without the Son <span
id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503.md) , He could not be the Father: and
if He thereafter had the Son, thereafter He became the Father, not
having been the Father prior to this, and He was changed from that which
was not the Father and became the Father. This is the worst form of
blasphemy <span id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md) . For we may not
speak of God as destitute of natural generative power: and generative
power means, the power of producing from one’s self, that is to say,
from one’s own proper essence, that which is like in nature to one’s
self <span id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p24"></span>In treating, then, of the generation
of the Son, it is an act of impiety <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md) to say that time comes into play
and that the existence of the Son is of later origin than the Father.
For we hold that it is from Him, that is, from the Father’s nature, that
the Son is generated. And unless we grant that the Son co-existed from
the beginning with the Father, by Whom He was begotten, we introduce
change into the Father’s subsistence, because, not being the Father, He
subsequently became the Father <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md) . For the creation, even though it
originated later, is nevertheless not derived from the essence of God,
but is brought into existence out of nothing by His will and power, and
change does not touch God’s nature. For generation means that the
begetter produces out of his essence offspring similar in essence. But
creation and making mean that the creator and maker produces from that
which is external, and not out of his own essence, a creation of an
absolutely dissimilar nature <span id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md)
.

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p28"></span>Wherefore in God, Who alone is
passionless and unalterable, and immutable, and ever so continueth, both
begetting and creating are passionless <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) . For being by nature passionless
and not liable to flux, since He is simple and uncompound, He is not
subject to passion or flux either in begetting or in creating, nor has
He need of any co-operation. But generation in Him is without beginning
and everlasting, being the work of nature and producing out of His own
essence, that the Begetter may not undergo change, and that He may not
be God first and God last, nor receive any accession: while creation in
the case of God <span id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md) , being the
work of will, is not co-eternal with God. For it is not natural that
that which is brought into existence out of nothing should be co-eternal
with what is without beginning and everlasting. There is this difference
in fact between man’s making and God’s. Man can bring nothing into
existence out of nothing <span id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md) ,
but all that he makes requires pre-existing matter for its basis <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) , and he does not create it by will
only, but thinks out first what it is to be and pictures it in his mind,
and only then fashions it with his hands, undergoing labour and
trouble <span id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md) , and often missing
the mark and failing to produce to his satisfaction that after which he
strives. But God, through the exercise of will alone, has brought all
things into existence out of nothing. Now there is the same difference
between God and man in begetting and generating. For in God, Who is
without time and beginning, passionless, not liable to flux,
incorporeal, alone and without end <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md) , generation is without time and
beginning, passionless and not liable to flux, nor dependent on the
union of two <span id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) : nor has His
own incomprehensible generation beginning or end. And it is without
beginning because He is immutable: without flux because He is
passionless and incorporeal: independent of the union of two again
because He is incorporeal but also because He is the one and only God,
and stands in need of no co-operation: and without end or cessation
because He is without beginning, or time, or end, and ever continues the
same. For that which has no beginning has no end: but that which through
grace is endless is assuredly not without beginning, as, witness, the
angels <span id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p37"></span>Accordingly the everlasting God
generates His own Word which is perfect, without beginning and without
end, that God, Whose nature and existence are above time, may not
engender in time. But with man clearly it is otherwise, for generation
is with him a matter of sex, and destruction and flux and increase and
body clothe him round about <span id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md) ,
and he possesses a nature which is male or female. For the male requires
the assistance of the female. But may He Who surpasses all, and
transcends all thought and comprehension, be gracious to us.

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p39"></span>The holy catholic and apostolic
Church, <span id="page_8b">p. 8b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-Page_8b"></span>then, teaches the existence at once of
a Father: and of His Only-begotten Son, born of Him without time and
flux and passion, in a manner incomprehensible and perceived by the God
of the universe alone: just as we recognise the existence at once of
fire and the light which proceeds from it: for there is not first fire
and thereafter light, but they exist together. And just as light is ever
the product of fire, and ever is in it and at no time is separate from
it, so in like manner also the Son is begotten of the Father and is
never in any way <span id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md) separate
from Him, but ever is in Him <span id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md)
. But whereas the light which is produced from fire without separation,
and abideth ever in it, has no proper subsistence of its own distinct
from that of fire (for it is a natural quality of fire), the
Only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father without separation and
difference and ever abiding in Him, has a proper subsistence of its own
distinct from that of the Father.

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p42"></span>The terms, ‘Word’ and ‘effulgence,’
then, are used because He is begotten of the Father without the union of
two, or passion, or time, or flux, or separation <span
id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520.md) : and the terms ‘Son’ and ‘impress
of the Father’s subsistence,’ because He is perfect and has
subsistence <span id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521.md) and is in all
respects similar to the Father, save that the Father is not
begotten <span id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522.md) : and the term
‘Only-begotten’ <span id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523.md) because He
alone was begotten alone of the Father alone. For no other generation is
like to the generation of the Son of God, since no other is Son of God.
For though the Holy Spirit proceedeth from the Father, yet this is not
generative in character but processional. This is a different mode of
existence, alike incomprehensible and unknown, just as is the generation
of the Son. Wherefore all the qualities the Father has are the Son’s,
save that the Father is unbegotten <span
id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524.md) , and this exception involves no
difference in essence nor dignity <span
id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525.md) , but only a different mode of
coming into existence <span id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526.md) . We
have an analogy in Adam, who was not begotten (for God Himself moulded
him), and Seth, who was begotten (for he is Adam’s son), and Eve, who
proceeded out of Adam’s rib (for she was not begotten). These do not
differ from each other in nature, for they are human beings: but they
differ in the mode of coming into existence <span
id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p51"></span>For one must recognise that the word
<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p51.1"></span>ἀγένητον</span> with only one ‘<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p51.2"></span>ν</span>’ signifies
“uncreate” or “not having been made,” while <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p51.3"></span>ἀγέννητον</span> written with double
‘<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p51.4"></span>ν</span>’
means “unbegotten.” According to the first significance essence differs
from essence: for one essence is uncreate, or <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p51.5"></span>ἀγένητον</span> with one ‘<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p51.6"></span>ν</span>,’ and
another is create or <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p51.7"></span>γενητή</span>. But in the second
significance there is no difference between essence and essence. For the
first subsistence of all kinds of living creatures is <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p51.8"></span>ἀγέννητος</span> but
not <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p51.9"></span>ἀγένητος</span>. For they were created
by the Creator, being brought into being by His Word, but they were not
begotten, for there was no pre-existing form like themselves from which
they might have been born.

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p52"></span>So then in the first sense of the
word the three absolutely divine subsistences of the Holy Godhead
agree <span id="fr_1528"></span>[1529](#fn_1528.md) : for they exist as one
in essence and uncreate <span id="fr_1529"></span>[1530](#fn_1529.md) . But
with the second signification it is quite otherwise. For the Father
alone is ingenerate <span id="fr_1530"></span>[1531](#fn_1530.md) , no
other subsistence having given Him being. And the Son alone is generate,
for He was begotten of the Father’s essence without beginning and
without time. And only the Holy Spirit proceedeth from the Father’s
essence, not having been generated but simply proceeding <span
id="fr_1531"></span>[1532](#fn_1531.md) . For this is the doctrine of Holy
Scripture. But the nature of the generation and the procession is quite
beyond comprehension.

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p57"></span>And this also it behoves <span
id="fr_1532"></span>[1533](#fn_1532.md) us to know, that the names
Fatherhood, Sonship and Procession, were not applied to the Holy Godhead
by us: on the contrary, they were communicated to us by the Godhead, as
the divine apostle says, *Wherefore I bow the knee to the Father, from
Whom is every family in heaven and on earth* <span
id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533.md) . But if we say <span
id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534.md) that the Father is the origin of
the Son and greater than the <span id="page_9b">p. 9b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-Page_9b"></span>Son, we do not suggest any precedence
in time or superiority in nature of the Father over the Son <span
id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535.md) (for through His agency He made the
ages <span id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536) .md), or superiority in any
other respect save causation. And we mean by this, that the Son is
begotten of the Father and not the Father of the Son, and that the
Father naturally is the cause of the Son: just as we say in the same way
not that fire proceedeth from light, but rather light from fire. So
then, whenever we hear it said that the Father is the origin of the Son
and greater than the Son, let us understand it to mean in respect of
causation. And just as we do not say that fire is of one essence and
light of another, so we cannot say that the Father is of one essence and
the Son of another: but both are of one and the same essence <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537.md) . And just as we say that fire has
brightness <span id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md) through the light
proceeding from it, and do not consider the light of the fire as an
instrument ministering to the fire, but rather as its natural force: so
we say that the Father creates all that He creates through His
Only-begotten Son, not as though the Son were a mere instrument
serving <span id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539.md) the Father’s ends,
but as His natural and subsistential force <span
id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540.md) . And just as we say both that the
fire shines and again that the light of the fire shines, *So all things
whatsoever the Father doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise* <span
id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541.md) . But whereas light possesses no
proper subsistence of its own, distinct from that of the fire, the Son
is a perfect subsistence <span id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542.md) ,
inseparable from the Father’s subsistence, as we have shewn above. For
it is quite impossible to find in creation an image that will illustrate
in itself exactly in all details the nature of the Holy Trinity. For how
could that which is create and compound, subject to flux and change,
circumscribed, formed and corruptible, clearly shew forth the
super-essential divine essence, unaffected as it is in any of these
ways? Now it is evident that all creation is liable to most of these
affections, and all from its very nature is subject to corruption.

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p69"></span>Likewise we believe also in one Holy
Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life: Who proceedeth from the Father and
resteth in the Son: the object of equal adoration and glorification with
the Father and Son, since He is co-essential and co-eternal <span
id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md) : the Spirit of God, direct,
authoritative <span id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md) , the fountain
of wisdom, and life, and holiness: God existing and addressed along with
Father and Son: uncreate, full, creative, all-ruling, all-effecting,
all-powerful, of infinite power, Lord of all creation and not under any
lord <span id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md) : deifying, not
deified <span id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546.md) : filling, not
filled: shared in, not sharing in: sanctifying, not sanctified: the
intercessor, receiving the supplications of all: in all things like to
the Father and Son: proceeding from the Father and communicated through
the Son, and participated in by all creation, through Himself creating,
and investing with essence and sanctifying, and maintaining the
universe: having subsistence, existing in its own proper and peculiar
subsistence, inseparable and indivisible from Father and Son, and
possessing all the qualities that the Father and Son possess, save that
of not being begotten or born. For the Father is without cause and
unborn: for He is derived from nothing, but derives from Himself His
being, nor does He derive a single quality from another <span
id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547.md) . Rather He is Himself the
beginning and cause of the existence of all things in a definite and
natural manner. But the Son is derived from the Father after the manner
of generation, and the Holy Spirit likewise is derived from the Father,
yet not after the manner of generation, but after that of procession.
And we have learned that there is a difference <span
id="fr_1548"></span>[1549](#fn_1548.md) between generation and procession,
but the nature of that difference we in no wise understand. Further, the
generation of the Son from the Father and the procession of the Holy
Spirit are simultaneous.

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p76"></span>All then that the Son and the Spirit
have is from the Father, even their very being <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[1550](#fn_1549.md) : and unless the Father is, neither
the Son nor the Spirit is. And unless the Father possesses a certain
attribute, neither the Son nor the Spirit possesses it: and through the
Father <span id="fr_1550"></span>[1551](#fn_1550.md) , that is, because of
the Father’s existence <span id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551.md) , the
Son and the Spirit exist <span id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552.md) ,
and through the Father, that is, because of the Father having the
qualities, the Son and the Spirit have all their qualities, those of
being unbegotten, and of birth and of procession being excepted <span
id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553.md) . For in these *hypo*<span
id="page_10b">p. 10b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-Page_10b"></span>*static* or *personal* properties
alone do the three holy subsistences <span
id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md) differ from each other, being
indivisibly divided not by essence but by the distinguishing mark of
their proper and peculiar subsistence.

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p83"></span>Further we say that each of <span
id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555.md) the three has a perfect
subsistence, that we may understand not one compound perfect nature made
up of three imperfect elements, but one simple essence, surpassing and
preceding perfection, existing in three perfect subsistences <span
id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556.md) . For all that is composed of
imperfect elements must necessarily be compound. But from perfect
subsistences no compound can arise. Wherefore we do not speak of the
form as from subsistences, but as in subsistences <span
id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md) . But we speak of those things as
imperfect which do not preserve the form of that which is completed out
of them. For stone and wood and iron are each perfect in its own nature,
but with reference to the building that is completed out of them each is
imperfect: for none of them is in itself a house.

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p87"></span>The subsistences then we say are
perfect, that we may not conceive of the divine nature as compound. For
compoundness is the beginning of separation. And again we speak of the
three subsistences as being in each other <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558.md) , that we may not introduce a crowd
and multitude of Gods <span id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559.md) . Owing
to the three subsistences, there is no compoundness or confusion: while,
owing to their having the same essence and dwelling in one another, and
being the same in will, and energy, and power, and authority, and
movement, so to speak, we recognise the indivisibility and the unity of
God. For verily there is one God, and His word and Spirit.

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p90"></span>Marg. <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p90.1"></span>ms.</span> Concerning the distinction of
the three subsistences: and concerning the thing itself and our reason
and thought in relation to it.

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p91"></span>One ought, moreover, to recognise
that it is one thing to look at a matter as it is, and another thing to
look at it in the light of reason and thought. In the case of all
created things, the distinction of the subsistences is observed in
actual fact. For in actual fact Peter is seen to be separate from Paul.
But the community and connection and unity are apprehended by reason and
thought. For it is by the mind that we perceive that Peter and Paul are
of the same nature and have one common nature <span
id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560.md) . For both are living creatures,
rational and mortal: and both are flesh, endowed with the spirit of
reason and understanding <span id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561.md) . It
is, then, by reason that this community of nature is observed. For here
indeed the subsistences do not exist one within the other. But each
privately and individually, that is to say, in itself, stands quite
separate, having very many points that divide it from the other. For
they are both separated in space and differ in time, and are divided in
thought, and power, and shape, or form, and habit, and temperament and
dignity, and pursuits, and all differentiating properties, but above
all, in the fact that they do not dwell in one another but are
separated. Hence it comes that we can speak of two, three, or many men.

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p94"></span>And this may be perceived throughout
the whole of creation, but in the case of the holy and superessential
and incomprehensible Trinity, far removed from everything, it is quite
the reverse. For there the community and unity are observed in fact,
through the co-eternity of the subsistences, and through their having
the same essence and energy and will and concord of mind <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md) , and then being identical in
authority and power and goodness—I do not say similar but identical—and
then movement by one impulse <span id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563.md)
. For there is one essence, one goodness, one power, one will, one
energy, one authority, one and the same, I repeat, not three resembling
each other. But the three subsistences have one and the same movement.
For each one of them is related as closely to the other as to itself:
that is to say that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one in
all respects, save those of not being begotten, of birth and of
procession. But it is by thought that the difference is perceived <span
id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md) . For we recognise one God: but
only in the attributes of Fatherhood, Sonship, and Procession, both in
respect of cause and effect and perfection of subsistence, that is,
manner of existence, do we perceive difference <span
id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md) . For with reference to the
uncircumscribed Deity we cannot speak of separation in space, as we can
in our own case. For the subsistences dwell in one another, in no wise
confused but cleaving together, according to the word of the Lord, <span
id="page_11b">p. 11b</span> <span id="iii.iv.i.viii-Page_11b"></span>*I
am in the father, and the father in Me* <span
id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md) : nor can one admit difference in
will or judgment or energy or power or anything else whatsoever which
may produce actual and absolute separation in our case. Wherefore we do
not speak of three Gods, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, but
rather of one God, the holy Trinity, the Son and Spirit being referred
to one cause <span id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md) , and not
compounded or coalesced according to the synæresis of Sabellius. For, as
we said, they are made one not so as to commingle, but so as to cleave
to each other, and they have their being in each other <span
id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md) without any coalescence or
commingling. Nor do the Son and the Spirit stand apart, nor are they
sundered in essence according to the diæresis of Arias <span
id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569.md) . For the Deity is undivided
amongst things divided, to put it concisely: and it is just like three
suns cleaving to each other without separation and giving out light
mingled and conjoined into one. When, then, we turn our eyes to the
Divinity, and the first cause and the sovereignty and the oneness and
sameness, so to speak, of the movement and will of the Divinity, and the
identity in essence and power and energy and lordship, what is seen by
us is unity <span id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570.md) . But when we
look to those things in which the Divinity is, or, to put it more
accurately, which are the Divinity, and those things which are in it
through the first cause without time or distinction in glory or
separation, that is to say, the subsistences of the Son and the Spirit,
it seems to us a Trinity that we adore <span
id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571.md) . The Father is one Father, and
without beginning, that is, without cause: for He is not derived from
anything. The Son is one Son, but not without beginning, that is, not
without cause: for He is derived from the Father. But if you eliminate
the idea of a beginning from time, He is also without beginning: for the
creator of times cannot be subject to time. The Holy Spirit is one
Spirit, going forth from the Father, not in the manner of Sonship but of
procession; so that neither has the Father lost His property of being
unbegotten because He hath begotten, nor has the Son lost His property
of being begotten because He was begotten of that which was unbegotten
(for how could that be so?), nor does the Spirit change either into the
Father or into the Son because He hath proceeded and is God. For a
property is quite constant. For how could a property persist if it were
variable, moveable, and could change into something else? For if the
Father is the Son, He is not strictly the Father: for there is strictly
one Father. And if the Son is the Father, He is not strictly the Son:
for there is strictly one Son and one Holy Spirit.

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p105"></span>Further, it should be understood
that we do not speak of the Father as derived from any one, but we speak
of Him as the Father of the Son. And we do not speak of the Son as
Cause <span id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572.md) or Father, but we speak
of Him both as from the Father, and as the Son of the Father. And we
speak likewise of the Holy Spirit as from the Father, and call Him the
Spirit of the Father. And we do not speak of the Spirit as from the
Son <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md) :  <span
id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md) but yet we call Him the Spirit of
the Son. *For if any one hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of
His* <span id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md) , saith the divine
apostle. And we confess that He is manifested and imparted to us through
the Son. *For He breathed upon His Disciples, says he, and said, Receive
ye the Holy Spirit* <span id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md) . It is
just the same as in the case of the sun from which come both the ray and
the radiance (for the sun itself is the source of both the ray and the
radiance), and it is through the ray that the radiance is imparted to
us, and it is the radiance itself by which we are lightened and in which
we participate. Further we do not speak of the Son of the Spirit, or of
the Son as derived from the Spirit <span
id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p20"></span> The Arians admitted that the Son is
*in* the Father, in the sense in which all created things are *in* God.
Basil (*De Spiritu Sancto*, ch. 25, *Orat*. in *Princip. evang. Joan*.)
takes the preposition <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p20.1"></span>σύν</span>, *in*, to express the idea of
the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p20.2"></span>σύναφεια</span>, or *conjunction* of the
two. The Scholiast on the present passages calls attention to the two
prepositions *with* and *in* as denoting the Son’s eternal existence and
His union with the Father, as the *shining* is with the *light*, and
comes from it without separation. *Basil, De Spir. Sancto*, ch. 26,
holds it better to say that the Spirit is *one with* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p20.3"></span>συνεῖναι</span>) the
Father and the Son than that He is *in* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p20.4"></span>ἐνεῖναι</span>) the Father and the Son.

be inferred that the Son is not equal to the Father in Divine nature,
but of another nature; but “the Father is *greater* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p60.3"></span>μείζων</span>) than
I,” that is to say, not in dignity or age, but as being begotten of the
Father. And further, that by the word “greater” He indicates the
peculiar property of the substance (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p60.4"></span>τῆς</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p60.5"></span>οὐσίας τὴν ἰδιότητα</span>). This
declaration of our Lord’s was understood in the same way by Basil,
Gregory Nazianzenus, Cyril and others of the Greek Fathers, and by
Hilary among the Latin Fathers. In the ixth and xth Books of his *De
Trinitate* Hilary refers to this, and says that the Father is called
‘greater’ *propter auctoritatem*, meaning by *auctoritas* not *power*,
but what the Greeks understand by <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p60.6"></span>αἰτιότης</span>, *causation, principle
or authorship* of being. So also Soebadius says that the Father is
rightly called ‘*greater*,’ because He alone is without an author of His
being. But Latin theologians usually spoke of the Father as ‘*greater*,’
not because He is *Father*, but because the Son was made Man. To this
effect also Athanasius expresses himself in his *De hum. carne
suscepta*, while Gregory Nazianzenus speaks otherwise in his *Orat*. 36.

μία ἀρχή, κατὰ τοῦτο εἷς Θεός</span>. The three Persons or Subsistences
are yet One God, because of the one Principle of Being whence Son and
spirit derive. So the Father is said to be the <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p101"></span> The Greek runs thus:—<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.viii-p101.1"></span>καὶ τὴν ἐν ἀλλήλαις
περιχώρησιν ἔχουσι δίχα πάσης συναλοιφῆς καὶ συμφύρσεως</span>. The term
<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.viii-p101.2"></span>περιχώρησις</span>, *circumincessio*,
*immanentia*, was meant to express the peculiarity of the relations of
the Three Divine Persons or Subsistences—their Indwelling in each other,
the fact that, while they are distinct they yet are in one another, the
Coinherence which implies their equal and identical Godhead. “In the
Trinity,” says Bishop Bull (*Defence of the Nicene Creed*, bk. iv. ch.
iv., secs. 13, 14), “the circumincession is most proper and perfect,
forasmuch as the Persons mutually contain Each Other, and all the three
have an immeasureable whereabouts (*immensum ubi*, as the Schoolmen
express it), so that wherever one Person is there the other two exist;
in other words They are all everywhere.…This outcome of the
circumincession of the Persons in the Trinity is so far from introducing
Sabellianism, that it is of great use, as Petavius has also observed,
for (establishing) the diversity of the Persons, and for confuting that
heresy. For, in order to that mutual existence (in each other) which is
discerned in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, it is absolutely
necessary that there should be some distinction between these who are
thus joined together—that is, that those that exist mutually in each
other should be different in reality, and not in mode of conception
only; for that which is simply one is not said to exist in itself, or to
interpenetrate itself.…Lastly, this is to be especially considered—that
this circumincession of the Divine Persons is indeed a very great
mystery, which we ought rather religiously to adore than curiously to
pry into. No similitude can be devised which shall be in every respect
apt to illustrate it; no language avails worthily to set it forth,
seeing that it is an union which far transcends all other unions.”
