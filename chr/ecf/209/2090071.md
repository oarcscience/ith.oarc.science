<span id="iii.iv.ii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*Concerning Memory.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xx-p2"></span>The faculty of memory is the
cause <span id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839.md) and storehouse of
remembrance and recollection. For memory is a fantasy <span
id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840.md) that is left behind of some
sensation and thought <span id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841.md)
manifesting itself in action; or the preservation <span
id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842.md) of a sensation and thought <span
id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843.md) . For the soul comprehends objects
of sense through the organs of sense, that is to say, it perceives, and
thence arises a notion: and similarly it comprehends the objects of
thought through the mind, and thence arises a thought. It is then the
preservation of the types of these notions and thoughts that is spoken
of as memory.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xx-p8"></span>Further, it is worthy of remark that
the apprehension of matters of thought depends on learning, or natural
process of thought, and not on sensation. For though objects of sense
are retained in the memory by themselves, only such objects of thought
are remembered as we have learned, and we have no memory of their
essence.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xx-p9"></span>Recollection is the name given to the
recovery of some memory lost by forgetfulness. For forgetfulness is just
loss of memory. The faculty of imagination <span
id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844.md) then, having apprehended material
objects through the senses, transmits this to the faculty of thought or
reason (for they are both the same), and this after it has received and
passed judgment on it, passes it on to the faculty of memory. Now the
organ of memory is the posterior ventricle of the brain, which the
Greeks call the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xx-p10.2"></span>παρεγκεφαλίς</span>, and the vital spirit
it contains.
