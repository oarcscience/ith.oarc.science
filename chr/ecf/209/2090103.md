<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*Concerning
ignorance and servitude.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxi-p2"></span>He assumed, it is to be noted <span
id="fr_2205"></span>[2206](#fn_2205.md) , the ignorant and servile
nature <span id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206.md) . For it is man’s
nature to be the servant of God, his Creator, and he does not possess
knowledge of the future. If, then, as Gregory the Theologian holds, you
are to separate the realm of sight from the realm of thought, the flesh
is to be spoken of as both servile and ignorant, but on account of the
identity of subsistence and the inseparable union the soul of the Lord
was enriched with the knowledge of the future as also with the other
miraculous powers. For just as the flesh of men is not in its own nature
life-giving, while the flesh of our Lord which was united in subsistence
with God the Word Himself, although it was not exempt from the mortality
of its nature, yet became life-giving through its union in subsistence
with the Word, and we may not say that it was not and is not for ever
life-giving: in like manner His human nature does not in essence possess
the knowledge of the future, but the soul of the Lord through its union
with God the Word Himself and its identity in subsistence was enriched,
as I said, with the knowledge of the future as well as with the other
miraculous powers.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxi-p5"></span>Observe further <span
id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207.md) that we may not speak of Him as
servant. For the words servitude and mastership are not marks of nature
but indicate relationship, to something, such as that of fatherhood and
sonship. For these do not signify essence but relation.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxi-p7"></span>It is just as we said, then, in
connection with ignorance, that if you separate with subtle thoughts,
that is, with fine imaginings, the created from the uncreated, the flesh
is a servant, unless it has been united with God the Word <span
id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208.md) . But how can it be a servant when
it is once united in subsistence? For since Christ is one, He cannot be
His own servant and Lord. For these are not simple predications but
relative. Whose servant, then could He be? His Father’s? The Son, then,
would not have all the Father’s attributes, if He is the Father’s
servant and yet in no respect His own. Besides, how could the apostle
say concerning us who were adopted by Him, *So that you are no longer a
servant but a son* <span id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209.md) , if
indeed He is Himself a servant? The word servant, then, is used merely
as a title, though not in the strict meaning: but for our sakes He
assumed the form of a servant and is called a servant among us. For
although He is without passion, yet for our sake He was the servant of
passion and became the minister of our salvation. Those, then, who say
that He is a servant divide the one Christ into two, just as Nestorius
did. But we declare Him to be Master and Lord of all creation, the one
Christ, at once God and man, and all-knowing. *For in Him are all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge, the hidden treasures* <span
id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210.md) .
