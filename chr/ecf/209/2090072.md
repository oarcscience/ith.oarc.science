id="iii.iv.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*Concerning
Conception and Articulation.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxi-p2"></span>Again the reasoning part of the soul
is divided into conception and articulation. Conception is an activity
of the soul originating in the reason without resulting in utterance.
Accordingly, often, even when we are silent we run through a whole
speech in our minds, and hold discussions in our dreams. And it is this
faculty chiefly which constitutes us all reasoning beings. For those who
are dumb by birth or have lost their voice through some disease or
injury, are just as much reasoning beings. But articulation by voice or
in the different dialects requires energy: that is to say, the word is
articulated by the tongue and mouth, and this is why it is named
articulation. It is, indeed, the messenger of thought, and it is because
of it that we are called speaking beings.
