<span id="iii.iv.i.x-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*Concerning divine union
and separation.*

<span id="iii.iv.i.x-p2"></span>Therefore all these names must be
understood as common to deity as a whole, and as containing the notions
of sameness and simplicity and indivisibility and union: while the names
Father, Son and Spirit, and causeless and caused, and unbegotten and
begotten, and procession contain the idea of separation: for these terms
do not explain His essence, but the mutual relationship <span
id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590.md) and manner of existence <span
id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591.md) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.x-p5"></span>When, then, we have perceived these
things and are conducted from these to the divine essence, we do not
apprehend the essence itself but only the attributes of the essence:
just as we have not apprehended the essence of the soul even when we
have learnt that it is incorporeal and without magnitude and form: nor
again, the essence of the body when we know that it is white or black,
but only the attributes of the essence. Further, the true doctrine <span
id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592.md) teacheth that the Deity is simple
and has one simple energy, good and energising in all things, just as
the sun’s ray, which warms all things and energises in each in harmony
with its natural aptitude and receptive power, having obtained this form
of energy from God, its Maker.

<span id="iii.iv.i.x-p7"></span>But quite distinct is all that pertains
to the divine and benignant incarnation of the divine Word. For in that
neither the Father nor the Spirit have any part at all, unless so far as
regards approval and the working of inexplicable miracles which the
God-Word, <span id="page_13b">p. 13b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.i.x-Page_13b"></span>having become man <span
id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593.md) like us, worked, as unchangeable
God and son of God <span id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594.md) .
