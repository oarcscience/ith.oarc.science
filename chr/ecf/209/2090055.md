<span id="iii.iv.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*Concerning the devil
and demons.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iv-p2"></span>He who from among these angelic powers
was set over <span id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669) the earthly
realm, and into whose hands God committed the guardianship of the earth,
was not made wicked in nature but was good, and made for good ends, and
received from his Creator no trace whatever of evil in himself. But he
did not sustain the brightness and the honour which the Creator had
bestowed <span id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670) on him, and of his
free choice was changed from what was in harmony to what was at variance
with his nature, and became roused against God Who created him, and
determined to rise in rebellion against Him <span
id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671) : and he was the first to depart
from good and become evil <span id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672) .
For evil is nothing else than absence of goodness, just as darkness also
is absence of light. For goodness is the light of the mind, and,
similarly, evil is the darkness of the mind. Light, therefore, being the
work of the Creator and being made good (for *God saw all that He made,
and behold they were exceeding good* <span
id="fr_1673"></span>[1674](#fn_1673) ) produced darkness at His
free-will. But along with him an innumerable host of angels subject to
him were torn away and followed him and shared in his fall. Wherefore,
being of the same nature <span id="fr_1674"></span>[1675](#fn_1674) as
the angels, they became wicked, turning away at their own free choice
from good to evil <span id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iv-p10"></span>Hence they have no power or strength
against any one except what God in His dispensation hath conceded to
them, as for instance, against Job <span
id="fr_1676"></span>[1677](#fn_1676) and those swine that are mentioned
in the Gospels <span id="fr_1677"></span>[1678](#fn_1677) . But when God
has made the concession they do prevail, and are changed and transformed
into any form whatever in which they wish to appear.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iv-p13"></span>Of the future both the angels of God
and the demons are alike ignorant: yet they make predictions. God
reveals the future to the angels and commands them to prophesy, and so
what they say comes to pass. But the demons also make predictions,
sometimes because they see what is happening at a distance, and
sometimes merely making guesses: hence much that they say is false and
they should not be believed, even although they do often, in the way we
have said, tell what is true. Besides they know the Scriptures.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iv-p14"></span>All wickedness, then, and all impure
passions are the work of their mind. But while the liberty to attack man
has been granted to them, they have not the strength to over-master any
one: for we have it in our power to receive or not to receive the
attack <span id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678) . Wherefore there has
been prepared for the <span id="page_21b">p. 21b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.iv-Page_21b"></span>devil and his demons, and those who
follow him, fire unquenchable and everlasting punishment <span
id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.iv-p17"></span>Note, further, that what in the case
of man is death is a fall in the case of angels. For after the fall
there is no possibility of repentance for them, just as after death
there is for men no repentance <span
id="fr_1680"></span>[1681](#fn_1680) .
