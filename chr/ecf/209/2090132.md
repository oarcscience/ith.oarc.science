<span id="iii.iv.iv.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*That there are not two
Kingdoms.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xx-p2"></span>That there are not two kingdoms <span
id="fr_2619"></span>[2620](#fn_2619.md) , one good and one bad, we shall
see from this. For good and evil are opposed to one another and mutually
destructive, and cannot exist in one another or with one another. Each
of them, therefore, in its own division will belong to the whole, and
first <span id="fr_2620"></span>[2621](#fn_2620.md) they will be
circumscribed, not by the whole alone but also each of them by part of
the whole.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xx-p5"></span>Next I ask <span
id="fr_2621"></span>[2622](#fn_2621.md) , who it is that assigns <span
id="fr_2622"></span>[2623](#fn_2622.md) to each its place. For they will
not affirm that they have come to a friendly agreement with, or been
reconciled to, one another. For evil is not evil when it is at peace
with, and reconciled to, goodness, nor is goodness good when it is on
amicable terms with evil. But if He Who has marked off to each of these
its own sphere of action is something different from them, He must the
rather be God.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xx-p8"></span>One of two things indeed is necessary,
either that they come in contact with and destroy one another, or that
there exists some intermediate place where neither goodness nor evil
exists, separating both from one another, like a partition. And so there
will be no longer two but three kingdoms.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xx-p9"></span>Again, one of these alternatives is
necessary, either that they are at peace, which is quite incompatible
with evil (for that which is at peace is not evil), or they are at
strife, which <span id="page_94b">p. 94b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xx-Page_94b"></span>is incompatible with goodness (for
that which is at strife is not perfectly good), or the evil is at strife
and the good does not retaliate, but is destroyed by the evil, or they
are ever in trouble and distress <span
id="fr_2623"></span>[2624](#fn_2623.md) , which is not a mark of goodness.
There is, therefore, but one kingdom, delivered from all evil.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xx-p11"></span>But if this is so, they say, whence
comes evil <span id="fr_2624"></span>[2625](#fn_2624.md) ? For it is quite
impossible that evil should originate from goodness. We answer then,
that evil is nothing else than absence of goodness and a lapsing <span
id="fr_2625"></span>[2626](#fn_2625.md) from what is natural into what is
unnatural: for nothing evil is natural. For all things, whatsoever God
made, are very good <span id="fr_2626"></span>[2627](#fn_2626.md) , so far
as they were made: if, therefore, they remain just as they were created,
they are very good, but when they voluntarily depart from what is
natural and turn to what is unnatural, they slip into evil.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xx-p15"></span>By nature, therefore, all things are
servants of the Creator and obey Him. Whenever, then, any of His
creatures voluntarily rebels and becomes disobedient to his Maker, he
introduces evil into himself. For evil is not any essence nor a property
of essence, but an accident, that is, a voluntary deviation from what is
natural into what is unnatural, which is sin.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xx-p16"></span>Whence, then, comes sin <span
id="fr_2627"></span>[2628](#fn_2627.md) ? It is an invention of the
free-will of the devil. Is the devil, then, evil? In so far as he was
brought into existence he is not evil but good. For he was created by
his Maker a bright and very brilliant angel, endowed with free-will as
being rational. But he voluntarily departed from the virtue that is
natural and came into the darkness of evil, being far removed from God,
Who alone is good and can give life and light. For from Him every good
thing derives its goodness, and so far as it is separated from Him in
will (for it is not in place), it falls into evil.
