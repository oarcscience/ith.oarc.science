<span id="iii.iv.i.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*The properties of the
divine nature.*

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiv-p2"></span>Uncreate, without beginning, immortal,
infinite, eternal, immaterial <span id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md)
, good, creative, just, enlightening, immutable, passionless,
uncircumscribed, immeasurable, unlimited, undefined, unseen,
unthinkable, wanting in nothing, being His own rule and authority,
all-ruling, life-giving, omnipotent, of infinite power, containing and
maintaining the universe and making provision for all: all these and
such like attributes the Deity possesses by nature, not having received
them from elsewhere, but Himself imparting all good to His own creations
according to the capacity of each.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiv-p4"></span>The subsistences dwell and are
established firmly in one another. For they are inseparable and cannot
part from one another, but keep to their separate courses within one
another, without coalescing or mingling, but cleaving to each other. For
the Son is in the Father and the Spirit: and the Spirit in the Father
and the Son: and the Father in the Son and the Spirit, but there is no
coalescence or commingling or confusion <span
id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md) . And there is one and the same
motion: for there is one impulse and one motion of the three
subsistences, which is not to be observed in any created nature.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiv-p6"></span>Further the divine effulgence and
energy, being one and simple and indivisible, assuming many varied forms
in its goodness among what is divisible and allotting to each the
component parts of its own nature, still remains simple and is
multiplied without division among the divided, and gathers and converts
the divided into its own simplicity <span
id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) . For all things long after it and
have their existence in it. It gives also to all things being according
to their several natures <span id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md) ,
and it is itself the being of existing things, the life of living
things, the reason of rational beings, the thought of thinking beings.
But it is itself above mind and reason and life and essence.

<span id="iii.iv.i.xiv-p9"></span>Further the divine nature has the
property of penetrating all things without mixing with them and of being
itself impenetrable by anything else. Moreover, there is the property of
knowing all things with a simple knowledge and of seeing all things,
simply with His divine, all-surveying, immaterial eye, both the things
of the present, and the things of the past, and the things of the
future, before they come into being <span
id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) . It is also sinless, and can cast
sin out, and bring salvation: and all that it wills, it can accomplish,
but does not will all it could accomplish. For it could destroy the
universe but it does not will so to do <span
id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md) .
