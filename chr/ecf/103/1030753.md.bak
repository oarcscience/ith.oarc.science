<span id="v.vii.xxii-p1"></span> 21. Moreover, if discourse must be
bestowed upon any, and this so take up the speaker that he have not time
to work with his hands, are all in the monastery able to hold discourse
unto brethren which come unto them from another kind of life, whether it
be to expound the divine lessons, or concerning any questions which may
be put, to reason in an wholesome manner? Then since not all have the
ability, why upon this pretext do all want to have nothing else to do?
Although even if all were able, they ought to do it by turns; not only
that the rest might not be taken up from necessary works, but also
because it sufficeth that to many hearers there be one speaker. To come
now to the Apostle; how could he find time to work with his hands,
unless for the bestowing of the word of God he had certain set times?
And indeed God hath not willed this either to be hidden from us. For
both of what craft he was a workman, and at what times he was taken up
with dispensing the Gospel, holy Scripture has not left untold. Namely,
when the day of his departure caused him to be in haste, being at Troas,
even on the first day of the week when the brethren were assembled to
break bread, such was his earnestness, and so necessary the disputation,
that his discourse was prolonged even until midnight, <span
id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542.md) as though it had slipped from their
minds that on that day it was not a fast: <span
id="fr_2543"></span>[2544](#fn_2543.md) but when he was making longer stay
in any place and disputing daily, who can doubt that he had certain
hours set apart for this office? For at Athens, because he had there
found most studious inquirers of things, it is thus written of him: “He
disputed therefore with the Jews in the synagogue, and with the Gentile
inhabitants <span id="fr_2544"></span>[2545](#fn_2544.md) in the market
every day to those who were there.” <span
id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545.md) Not, namely, in the synagogue every
day, for there it was his custom to discourse on the sabbath; but “in
the market,” saith he, “every day;” by reason, doubtless, of the
studiousness of the Athenians. For so it follows: “Certain however of
the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers conferred with him.” And a little
after, it says: “Now the Athenians and strangers which were there spent
their time in nothing else <span id="page_515">p. 515</span> <span
id="v.vii.xxii-Page_515"></span>but either to tell or to hear some new
thing.” Let us suppose him all those days that he was at Athens not to
have worked: on this account, indeed, was his need supplied from
Macedonia, as he says in the second to the Corinthians: <span
id="fr_2546"></span>[2547](#fn_2546.md) though in fact he could work both
at other hours and of nights, because he was so strong in both mind and
body. But when he had gone from Athens, let us see what says the
Scripture: “He disputed,” saith it, “in the synagogue every
sabbath;” <span id="fr_2547"></span>[2548](#fn_2547.md) this at Corinth. In
Troas, however, where through necessity of his departure being close at
hand, his discourse was protracted until midnight, it was the first day
of the week, which is called the Lord’s Day: whence we understand that
he was not with Jews but with Christians; when also the narrator himself
saith they were gathered together to break bread. And indeed this same
is the best management, that all things be distributed to their times
and be done in order, lest becoming ravelled in perplexing
entanglements, they throw our human mind into confusion.
