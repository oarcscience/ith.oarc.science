<span id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—How the Holy Spirit is
Called Love, and Whether He Alone is So Called. That the Holy Spirit is
in the Scriptures Properly Called by the Name of Love.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p2"></span>27. We have sufficiently spoken of
the Father and of the Son, so far as was possible for us to see through
this glass and in this enigma. We must now treat of the Holy Spirit, so
far as by God’s gift it is permitted to see Him. And the Holy Spirit,
according to the Holy Scriptures, is neither of the Father alone, nor of
the Son alone, but of both; and so intimates to us a mutual love,
wherewith the Father and the Son reciprocally love one another. But the
language of the Word of God, in order to exercise us, has caused those
things to be sought into with the greater zeal, which do not lie on the
surface, but are to be scrutinized in hidden depths, and to be drawn out
from thence. The Scriptures, accordingly, have not said, The Holy Spirit
is Love. If they had said so, they would have done away with no small
part of this inquiry. But they have said, “God is love;” <span
id="fr_995"></span>[996](#fn_995.md) so that it is uncertain and remains to
be inquired whether God the Father is love, or God the Son, or God the
Holy Ghost, or the Trinity itself which is God. For we are not going to
say that God is called Love because love itself is a substance worthy of
the name of God, but because it is a gift of God, as it is said to God,
“Thou art my patience.” <span id="fr_996"></span>[997](#fn_996.md) For this
is not said because our patience is God’s substance, but in that He
Himself gives it to us; as it is elsewhere read, “Since from Him is my
patience.” <span id="fr_997"></span>[998](#fn_997.md) For the usage of
words itself in Scripture sufficiently refutes this interpretation; for
“Thou art my patience” is of the same kind as “Thou, Lord, art my
hope,” <span id="fr_998"></span>[999](#fn_998.md) and “The Lord my God is
my mercy,” <span id="fr_999"></span>[1000](#fn_999.md) and many like texts.
And it is not said, O Lord my love, or, Thou art my love, or, God my
love; but it is said thus, “God is love,” as it is said, “God is a
Spirit.” <span id="fr_1000"></span>[1001](#fn_1000.md) And he who does not
discern this, must ask understanding from the Lord, not an explanation
from us; for we cannot say anything more clearly.

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p9"></span>28. “God,” then, “is love;” but the
question is, whether the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit, or the
Trinity itself: because the Trinity is not three Gods, but one God. But
I have already argued above in this book, that the Trinity, which is
God, is not so to be understood from those three things which have been
set forth in the trinity of our mind, as that the Father should be the
memory of all three, and the Son the understanding of all three, and the
Holy Spirit the love of all three; as though the Father should neither
understand nor love for Himself, but the Son should understand for Him,
and the Holy Spirit love for Him, but He Himself should remember only
both for Himself and for them; nor the Son remember nor love for
Himself, but the Father should remember for Him, and the Holy Spirit
love for Him, but He Himself understand only both for Himself and them;
nor likewise that the Holy Spirit should neither remember nor understand
for Himself, but the Father should remember for Him, and the Son
understand for Him, while He Himself should love only both for Himself
and for them; but rather in this way, that both all and each have all
three each in His own nature. Nor that these things should differ in
them, as in us memory is one thing, understanding another, love or
charity another, but should be some one thing that is <span
id="page_216">p. 216</span> <span
id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-Page_216"></span>equivalent to all, as wisdom itself;
and should be so contained in the nature of each, as that He who has it
is that which He has, as being an unchangeable and simple substance. If
all this, then, has been understood, and so far as is granted to us to
see or conjecture in things so great, has been made patently true, I
know not why both the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit should not
be called Love, and all together one love, just as both the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit is called Wisdom, and all together not
three, but one wisdom. For so also both the Father is God, and the Son
God, and the Holy Ghost God, and all three together one God.

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p10"></span>29. And yet it is not to no purpose
that in this Trinity the Son and none other is called the Word of God,
and the Holy Spirit and none other the Gift of God, and God the Father
alone is He from whom the Word is born, and from whom the Holy Spirit
principally proceeds. And therefore I have added the word principally,
because we find that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son also. But the
Father gave Him this too, not as to one already existing, and not yet
having it; but whatever He gave to the only-begotten Word, He gave by
begetting Him. Therefore He so begat Him as that the common Gift should
proceed from Him also, and the Holy Spirit should be the Spirit of both.
This distinction, then, of the inseparable Trinity is not to be merely
accepted in passing, but to be carefully considered; for hence it was
that the Word of God was specially called also the Wisdom of God,
although both Father and Holy Spirit are wisdom. If, then, any one of
the three is to be specially called Love, what more fitting than that it
should be the Holy Spirit?—namely, that in that simple and highest
nature, substance should not be one thing and love another, but that
substance itself should be love, and love itself should be substance,
whether in the Father, or in the Son, or in the Holy Spirit; and yet
that the Holy Spirit should be specially called Love.

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p11"></span>30. Just as sometimes all the
utterances of the Old Testament together in the Holy Scriptures are
signified by the name of the Law. For the apostle, in citing a text from
the prophet Isaiah, where he says, “With divers tongues and with divers
lips will I speak to this people,” yet prefaced it by, “It is written in
the Law.” <span id="fr_1001"></span>[1002](#fn_1001.md) And the Lord
Himself says, “It is written in their Law, They hated me without a
cause,” <span id="fr_1002"></span>[1003](#fn_1002.md) whereas this is read
in the Psalm. <span id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003.md) And sometimes
that which was given by Moses is specially called the Law: as it is
said, “The Law and the Prophets were until John;” <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[1005](#fn_1004.md) and, “On these two commandments
hang all the Law and the Prophets.” <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005.md) Here, certainly, that is specially
called the Law which was from Mount Sinai. And the Psalms, too, are
signified under the name of the Prophets; and yet in another place the
Saviour Himself says, “All things must needs be fulfilled, which are
written in the Law, and the Prophets, and the Psalms concerning
me.” <span id="fr_1006"></span>[1007](#fn_1006.md) Here, on the other side,
He meant the name of Prophets to be taken as not including the Psalms.
Therefore the Law with the Prophets and the Psalms taken together is
called the Law universally, and the Law is also specially so called
which was given by Moses. Likewise the Prophets are so called in common
together with the Psalms, and they are also specially so called
exclusive of the Psalms. And many other instances might be adduced to
teach us, that many names of things are both put universally, and also
specially applied to particular things, were it not that a long
discourse is to be avoided in a plain case. I have said so much, lest
any one should think that it was therefore unsuitable for us to call the
Holy Spirit Love, because both God the Father and God the Son can be
called Love.

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p18"></span>31. As, then, we call the only Word
of God specially by the name of Wisdom, although universally both the
Holy Spirit and the Father Himself is wisdom; so the Holy Spirit is
specially called by the name of Love, although universally both the
Father and the Son are love. But the Word of God, *i.e.* the
only-begotten Son of God, is expressly called the Wisdom of God by the
mouth of the apostle, where he says, “Christ the power of God, and the
wisdom of God.” <span id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007.md) But where the
Holy Spirit is called Love, is to be found by careful scrutiny of the
language of John the apostle, who, after saying, “Beloved, let us love
one another, for love is of God,” has gone on to say, “And every one
that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth
not God; for God is love.” Here, manifestly, he has called that love
God, which he said was of God; therefore God of God is love. But because
both the Son is born of God the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeds
from God the Father, it is rightly asked which of them we ought here to
think is the rather called the love that is God. For the Father only is
so God as not to be of God; and hence the love that is so God as to be
of God, is either the Son or the Holy Spirit. But when, in what <span
id="page_217">p. 217</span> <span
id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-Page_217"></span>follows, the apostle had mentioned
the love of God, not that by which we love Him, but that by which He
“loved us, and sent His Son to be a propitiator for our sins,” <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[1009](#fn_1008.md) and thereupon had exhorted us also
to love one another, and that so God would abide in us,—because, namely,
he had called God Love; immediately, in his wish to speak yet more
expressly on the subject, “Hereby,” he says, “know we that we dwell in
Him, and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit.” Therefore
the Holy Spirit, of whom He hath given us, makes us to abide in God, and
Him in us; and this it is that love does. Therefore He is the God that
is love. Lastly, a little after, when he had repeated the same thing,
and had said “God is love,” he immediately subjoined, “And he who
abideth in love, abideth in God, and God abideth in him;” whence he had
said above, “Hereby we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because
He hath given us of His Spirit.” He therefore is signified, where we
read that God is love. Therefore God the Holy Spirit, who proceedeth
from the Father, when He has been given to man, inflames him to the love
of God and of his neighbor, and is Himself love. For man has not whence
to love God, unless from God; and therefore he says a little after, “Let
us love Him, because He first loved us.” <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[1010](#fn_1009.md) The Apostle Paul, too, says, “The
love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is
given unto us.” <span id="fr_1010"></span>[1011](#fn_1010.md)
