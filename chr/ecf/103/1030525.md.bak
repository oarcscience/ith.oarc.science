<span id="v.ii.ix-p1"></span> 8. “Honorable,” therefore, “is marriage in
all, and the bed undefiled.” <span id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953.md)
And this we do not so call a good, as that it is a good in comparison of
fornication: otherwise there will be two evils, of which the second is
worse: or fornication will also be a good, because adultery is worse:
for it is worse to violate the marriage of another, than to cleave unto
an harlot: and adultery will be a good, because incest is worse; for it
is worse to lie with a mother than with the wife of another: and, until
we arrive at those things, which, as the Apostle saith, “it is a shame
even to speak of,” <span id="fr_1954"></span>[1955](#fn_1954.md) all will
be good in comparison of what are worse. But who can doubt that this is
false? Therefore marriage and for<span id="page_403">p. 403</span> <span
id="v.ii.ix-Page_403"></span>nication are not two evils, whereof the
second is worse: but marriage and continence are two goods, whereof the
second is better, even as this temporal health and sickness are not two
evils, whereof the second is worse; but that health and immortality are
two goods, whereof the second is better. Also knowledge and vanity are
not two evils, whereof vanity is the worse: but knowledge and charity
are two goods, whereof charity is the better. For “knowledge shall be
destroyed,” <span id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955.md) saith the
Apostle: and yet it is necessary for this time: but “charity shall never
fail.” Thus also this mortal begetting, on account of which marriage
takes place, shall be destroyed: but freedom from all sexual intercourse
is both angelic exercise <span id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956.md)
here, and continueth for ever. But as the repasts of the Just are better
than the fasts of the sacrilegious, so the marriage of the faithful is
to be set before the virginity of the impious. However neither in that
case is repast preferred to fasting, but righteousness to sacrilege; nor
in this, marriage to virginity, but faith to impiety. For for this end
the righteous, when need is, take their repast, that, as good masters,
they may give to their slaves, *i.e.,* their bodies, what is just and
fair: but for this end the sacrilegious fast, that they may serve
devils. Thus for this end the faithful are married, that they may be
chastely joined unto husbands, but for this end the impious are virgins,
that they may commit fornication away from the true God. As, therefore,
that was good, which Martha was doing, being engaged in the ministering
unto the Saints, but that better, which Mary, her sister, sitting at the
feet of the Lord, and hearing His word; thus we praise the good of
Susanna <span id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957.md) in married chastity,
but yet we set before her the good of the widow Anna, <span
id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958.md) and, much more, of the Virgin
Mary. <span id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959.md) It was good that they
were doing, who of their substance were ministering necessaries unto
Christ and His disciples: but better, who left all their substance, that
they might be freer to follow the same Lord. But in both these cases of
good, whether what these, or whether what Martha and Mary were doing,
the better could not be done, unless the other had been passed over or
left. Whence we are to understand, that we are not, on this account, to
think marriage an evil, because, unless there be abstinence from it,
widowed chastity, or virgin purity, cannot be had. For neither on this
account was what Martha was doing evil, because, unless her sister
abstained from it, she could not do what was better: nor on this account
is it evil to receive a just man or a prophet into one’s house, because
he, who wills to follow Christ unto perfection, ought not even to have a
house, in order to do what is better.
