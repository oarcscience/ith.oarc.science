id="iv.ii.lxxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 79.—Sins Which Appear Very
Trifling, are Sometimes in Reality Very Serious.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxxi-p2"></span>Again, there are some sins which would
be considered very trifling, if the Scriptures did not show that they
are really very serious. For who would suppose that the man who says to
his brother, “Thou fool,” is in danger of hell-fire, did not He who is
the Truth say so? To the wound, however, He immediately applies the
cure, giving a rule for reconciliation with one’s offended brother:
“Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest
that thy brother hath ought against thee; leave there thy gift before
the altar, and go thy way: first be reconciled to thy brother, and then
come and offer thy gift.” <span id="fr_1257"></span>[1258](#fn_1257.md)
Again, who would suppose that it was so great a sin to observe days, and
months, and times, and years, as those do who are anxious or unwilling
to begin anything on certain days, or in certain months or years,
because the vain doctrines of men lead them to think such times lucky or
unlucky, had we not the means of estimating the greatness of the evil
from the fear expressed by the apostle, who says to such men, “I am
afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain”? <span
