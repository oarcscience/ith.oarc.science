<span id="v.ix.xiv-p1"></span> 13. Such, however, is human infirmity,
that when in a dream a person shall see a dead man, he thinks it is the
soul that he sees: but when he shall in like manner dream of a living
man, he has no doubt that it is not a soul nor a body, but the likeness
of a man that has appeared to him: just as if it were not possible in
regard of dead men, in the same sort unconscious of it, that it should
not be their souls, but their likenesses that appear to the sleepers. Of
a surety, when we were at Milan, we heard tell of a certain person of
whom was demanded payment of a debt, with production of his deceased
father’s acknowledgment, <span id="fr_2739"></span>[2740](#fn_2739.md)
which debt unknown to the son the father had paid, whereupon the man
began to be very sorrowful, and to marvel that his father while dying
did not tell him what he owed when he also made his will. Then in this
exceeding anxiousness of his, his said father appeared to him in a
dream, and made known to him where was the counter <span
id="fr_2740"></span>[2741](#fn_2740.md) acknowledgment by which that
acknowledgment was cancelled. Which when the young man had found and
showed, he not only rebutted the wrongful claim of a false debt, but
also got back his father’s note <span
id="fr_2741"></span>[2742](#fn_2741.md) of hand which the father had not
got back when the money was paid. Here then the soul of a man is
supposed to have had care for his son, and to have come to him in his
sleep, that, teaching him what he did not know, he might relieve him of
a great trouble. But about the very same time as we heard this, it
chanced at Carthage that the rhetorician Eulogius, who had been my
disciple in that art, being (as he himself, after our return to Africa,
told us the story) in course of lecturing to his disciples on Cicero’s
rhetorical books, as he looked over the portion of reading which he was
to deliver on the following day, fell upon a certain passage, and not
being able to understand it, was scarce able to sleep for the trouble of
his mind: in which night, as he dreamed, I expounded to him that which
he did not understand; nay, <span id="page_546">p. 546</span> <span
id="v.ix.xiv-Page_546"></span>not I, but my likeness, while I was
unconscious of the thing, and far away beyond the sea, it might be,
doing, or it might be dreaming, some other thing, and not in the least
caring for his cares. In what way these things come about, I know not:
but in what way soever they come, why do we not believe it comes in the
same way for a person in a dream to see a dead man, as it comes that he
sees a living man? both, no doubt, neither knowing nor caring who, or
where, or when, dreams of their images.
