<span id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—No Gift of God is More
Excellent Than Love.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p2"></span>32. There is no gift of God more
excellent than this. It alone distinguishes the sons of the eternal
kingdom and the sons of eternal perdition. Other gifts, too, are given
by the Holy Spirit; but without love they profit nothing. Unless,
therefore, the Holy Spirit is so far imparted to each, as to make him
one who loves God and his neighbor, he is not removed from the left hand
to the right. Nor is the Spirit specially called the Gift, unless on
account of love. And he who has not this love, “though he speak with the
tongues of men and angels, is sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal; and
though he have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all
knowledge, and though he have all faith, so that he can remove
mountains, he is nothing; and though he bestow all his goods to feed the
poor, and though he give his body to be burned, it profiteth him
nothing.” <span id="fr_1011"></span>[1012](#fn_1011) How great a good,
then, is that without which goods so great bring no one to eternal life!
But love or charity itself,—for they are two names for one thing,—if he
have it that does not speak with tongues, nor has the gift of prophecy,
nor knows all mysteries and all knowledge, nor gives all his goods to
the poor, either because he has none to give or because some necessity
hinders, nor delivers his body to be burned, if no trial of such a
suffering overtakes him, brings that man to the kingdom, so that faith
itself is only rendered profitable by love, since faith without love can
indeed exist, but cannot profit. And therefore also the Apostle Paul
says, “In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
uncircumcision, but faith that worketh by love:” <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[1013](#fn_1012) so distinguishing it from that
faith by which even “the devils believe and tremble.” <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[1014](#fn_1013) Love, therefore, which is of God
and is God, is specially the Holy Spirit, by whom the love of God is
shed abroad in our hearts, by which love the whole Trinity dwells in us.
And therefore most rightly is the Holy Spirit, although He is God,
called also the gift of God. <span id="fr_1014"></span>[1015](#fn_1014)
And by that gift what else can properly be understood except love, which
brings to God, and without which any other gift of God whatsoever does
not bring to God?
