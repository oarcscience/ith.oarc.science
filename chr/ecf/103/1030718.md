<span id="v.vi.xxx-p1"></span> 29. Because, therefore, lying heretics
find not in the books of the New Testament any <span id="page_495">p.
495</span> <span id="v.vi.xxx-Page_495"></span>precedents of lying which
are meet to be imitated, they esteem themselves to be most copious in
their disputation wherein they opine that it is right to lie, when from
the old prophetical books, because it doth not appear therein, save to
the few who understand, to what must be referred the significative
sayings and doings which as such be true, they seem to themselves to
find out and allege many that be lies. But desiring to have, wherewith
they may defend themselves, precedents of deceit seemingly meet to be
imitated, they deceive themselves, and “their iniquity lieth unto
itself.” <span id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438) Those persons,
however, of whom it is not there to be believed that they wished to
prophesy, if in doing or saying they feigned aught with will of
deceiving, however it may be that from the very things also which they
did or said somewhat prophetical may be shapen out, being by His
omnipotence afore deposited therein as a seed and pre-disposed, Who
knoweth how to turn to good account even the ill-deeds of men, yet as
far as regards the persons themselves, without doubt they lied. But they
ought not to be esteemed meet for imitation simply for that they are
found in those books which are deservedly called holy and divine: for
those books contain the record of both the ill deeds and the good deeds
of men; the one to be eschewed, the other to be followed after: and some
are so put, that upon them is also sentence passed; some, with no
judgment there expressed, are left permitted for us to judge of: because
it was meet that we should not only be nourished by that which is plain,
but exercised by that which is obscure.
