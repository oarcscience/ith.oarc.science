<span id="v.ix.xvii-p1"></span> 16. Why should we not believe these to
be angelic operations through dispensation of the providence of God, Who
maketh good use of both good things and evil, according to the
unsearchable depth of His judgments? whether thereby the minds of
mortals be instructed, or whether deceived; whether consoled, or whether
terrified: according as unto each one there is to be either a showing of
mercy, or a taking of vengeance, by Him to Whom, not without a meaning,
the Church doth sing “of mercy and of judgment.” <span
id="fr_2745"></span>[2746](#fn_2745.md) Let each, as it shall please him,
take what I say. If the souls of the dead took part in the affairs of
the living, and if it were their very selves that, when we see them,
speak to us in sleep; to say nothing of others, there is my own self,
whom my pious mother would no night fail to visit, that mother who by
land and sea followed me that she might live with me. Far be the thought
that she should, by a life more happy, have been made cruel, to that
degree that when any thing vexes my heart she should not even console in
his sadness the son whom she loved with an only love, whom she never
wished to see mournful. But assuredly that which the sacred Psalm sings
in our ears, is true; “Because my father and my mother have forsaken me,
but the Lord hath taken me up.” <span
id="fr_2746"></span>[2747](#fn_2746.md) Then if our parents have forsaken
us, how take they part in our cares and affairs? But if parents do not,
who else are there of the dead who should know what we are doing, or
what we suffer? Isaiah the Prophet says, “For Thou art our Father:
because Abraham hath not known us, and Israel is not cognizant of
us.” <span id="fr_2747"></span>[2748](#fn_2747.md) If so great Patriarchs
were ignorant what was doing towards the People of them begotten, they
to whom, believing God, the People itself to spring from their stock was
promised; how are the dead mixed up with affairs and doings of the
living, either for cognizance or help? How say we that those were
favored who deceased ere the evils came which followed hard upon the
decease, if also after death they feel whatever things befall in the
calamitousness of human life? Or haply do we err in saying this, and in
accounting them to be quietly at rest whom the unquiet life of the
living makes solicitous? What then is that which to the most godly king
Josias God promised as a great benefit, that he should first die, that
he might not see the evils which He threatened should come to that place
and People? Which words of God are these: “Thus saith the Lord God of
Israel: concerning My words which thou hast heard, and didst fear before
My face when thou didst hear what I have spoken concerning this place
and them which dwell therein, that it should be forsaken and under a
curse; and hast rent thy garments, and wept before Me, and I have heard
thee, saith the Lord of Sabaoth: not so; behold, I will add thee unto
thy fathers, and thou shalt be added unto them in peace; and thine eyes
shall not see all the evils which I am bringing upon this place and upon
them that dwell therein.” <span id="fr_2748"></span>[2749](#fn_2748.md) He,
frightened by God’s comminations, had wept, and rent his garments, and
is made, by hastening on of his death, to be without care of all future
evils, because he should so rest in peace, that all those things he
should not see. There then are the spirits of the departed, where they
see not whatever things are doing, or events happening, in this life to
men. Then how do they see their own graves, or their own bodies, whether
they lie cast away, or buried? How do they take part in the misery of
the living, when they are either suffering their own evils, if they have
contracted such merits; or do rest in peace, as was promised to this
Josiah, where they undergo no evils, either by suffering themselves, or
by compassionate suffering with others, freed from all evils which by
suffer<span id="page_548">p. 548</span> <span
id="v.ix.xvii-Page_548"></span>ing themselves or with others while they
lived here they did undergo?
