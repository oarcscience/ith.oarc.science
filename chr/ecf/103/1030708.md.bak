<span id="v.vi.xx-p1"></span> 19. Some man will say, “So then any thief
whatever is to be accounted equal with that thief who steals with will
of mercy?” Who would say this? But of these two it does not follow that
any is good, because one is worse. He is worse who steals through
coveting, than he who steals through pity: but if all theft be sin, from
all theft we must abstain. For who can say that people may sin, even
though one sin be damnable, another venial? but now we are asking, if a
man shall do this or that, who will not sin or will sin? not, who will
sin more heavily or lightly. For even thefts themselves are more lightly
punished by law than crimes of lust: they are, however, both sins,
albeit the one lighter, the other heavier; so that a theft which is
committed of concupiescence is held to be lighter than an act of lust
which is committed for <span id="page_489">p. 489</span> <span
id="v.vi.xx-Page_489"></span>doing a good turn. Namely, in their own
kind these become lighter than other sins of the same kind, which appear
to be committed with a good intention; when yet the same compared with
sins of another kind lighter in respect of the kind itself, are found to
be heavier. It is a heavier sin to commit theft of avarice than of
mercy; and likewise it is a heavier sin to perpetrate lewdness of
luxury, than of mercy; and yet is it a heavier sin to commit adultery of
mercy, than to commit theft of avarice. Nor is it our concern now, what
is lighter or what heavier, but what are sins or are not. For no man can
say that it was a duty for a sin to be done, where it is clearly a sin;
but we say that it is a duty, if the sin were done so or so, to forgive
or not to forgive.
