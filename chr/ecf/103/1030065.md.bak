id="iv.i.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—As Christ is the Mediator of
Life, So the Devil is the Mediator of Death.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vi.xi-p2"></span>13. Therein is our true peace and firm
bond of union with our Creator, that we should be purified and
reconciled through the Mediator of life, as we had been polluted and
alienated, and so had departed from Him, through the mediator of death.
For as the devil through pride led man through pride to death; so Christ
through lowliness led back man through obedience to life. Since, as the
one fell through being lifted up, and cast down \[man\] also who
consented to him; so the other was raised up through being abased, and
lifted up \[man\] also who believed in Him. For because the devil had
not himself come thither whither he had led the way (inasmuch as he bare
indeed in his ungodliness the death of the spirit, but had not undergone
the death of the flesh, because he had not assumed the covering of the
flesh), he appeared to man to be a mighty chief among the legions of
devils, through whom he exercises his reign of deceits; so puffing up
man the more, who is eager for power more than righteousness, through
the pride of elation, or through false philosophy; or else entangling
him through sacrilegious rites, in which, while casting down headlong by
deceit and illusion the minds of the more curious and prouder sort, he
holds him captive also to magical trickery; promising too the cleansing
of the soul, through those initiations which they call <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.i.vi.xi-p2.1"></span>τελεταί</span>, by
transforming himself into an angel of light, <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) through divers machinations in signs
and prodigies of lying.
