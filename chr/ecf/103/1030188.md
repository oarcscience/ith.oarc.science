<span id="iv.i.xv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—There Was No Other More Suitable
Way of Freeing Man from the Misery of Mortality Than The Incarnation of
the Word. The Merits Which are Called Ours are the Gifts of God.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xv.x-p2"></span>13. Those then who say, What, had God no
other way by which He might free men from the misery of this mortality,
that He should will the only-begotten Son, God co-eternal with Himself,
to become man, by putting on a human soul and flesh, and being made
mortal to endure death?—these, I say, it is not enough so to refute, as
to assert that that mode by which God deigns to free us through the
Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus, is good and suitable to
the dignity of God; but we must show also, not indeed that no other mode
was possible to God, to whose power all things are equally subject, but
that there neither was nor need have been any other mode more
appropriate for curing our misery. For what was so necessary for the
building up of our hope, and for the freeing the minds of mortals cast
down by the condition of mortality itself, from despair of immortality,
than that it should be demonstrated to us at how great a price God rated
us, and how greatly He loved us? But what is more manifest and evident
in this so great proof hereof, than that the Son of God, unchangeably
good, remaining what He was in Himself, and receiving from us and for us
what He was not, apart from any loss of His own nature, and deigning to
enter into the fellowship of ours, should first, without any evil desert
of His own, bear our evils; and so with unobligated munificence should
bestow His own gifts upon us, who now believe how much God loves us, and
who now hope that of which we used to despair, without any good deserts
of our own, nay, with our evil deserts too going before?

<span id="iv.i.xv.x-p3"></span>14. Since those also which are called our
deserts, are His gifts. For, that faith may work by love, <span
id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805) “the love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.” <span
id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806) And He was then given, when Jesus was
glorified by the resurrection. For then He promised that He Himself
would send Him, and He sent Him; <span id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807)
because then, as it was written and foretold of Him, “He ascended up on
high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.” <span
id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808) These gifts constitute our deserts, by
which we arrive at the chief good of an immortal blessedness. “But God,”
says the apostle, “commendeth His love towards as, in that, while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, then, being now
justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.” To
this he goes on to add, “For if, when we were enemies, we were
reconciled to God by the death of His Son; much more, being reconciled,
we shall be saved by His life.” Those whom he first calls sinners he
afterwards calls the enemies of God; and those whom he first speaks of
as justified by His blood, he afterwards speaks of as reconciled by the
death of the Son of God; and those whom he speaks of first as saved from
wrath through Him, he afterwards speaks of as saved by His life. We were
not, therefore, before that grace merely anyhow sinners, but in such
sins that we were enemies of God. But the same apostle calls us above
several times by two appellations, *viz*. sinners and enemies of
God,—one as if the most mild, the other plainly the most harsh,—saying,
“For if when we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the
ungodly.” <span id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809) Those whom he called
weak, the same he called ungodly. Weakness seems something slight; but
sometimes it is such as to be called impiety. Yet except it were
weakness, it <span id="page_175">p. 175</span> <span
id="iv.i.xv.x-Page_175"></span>would not need a physician, who is in the
Hebrew Jesus, in the Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.xv.x-p8.3"></span>Σωτήρ</span>, but in our speech Saviour. And
this word the Latin language had not previously, but could have seeing
that it could have it when it wanted it. And this foregoing sentence of
the apostle, where he says, “For when we were yet weak, in due time He
died for the ungodly,” coheres with those two following sentences; in
the one of which he spoke of sinners, in the other of enemies of God, as
though he referred each severally to each, *viz.* sinners to the weak,
the enemies of God to the ungodly.
