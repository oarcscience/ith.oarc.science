<span id="v.iii.vi-p1"></span> 5. There is, therefore, no reason why the
virgins of God be sad, because themselves also cannot, keeping their
virginity, be mothers of the flesh. For Him alone could virginity give
birth to with fitting propriety, Who in His Birth could have no peer.
However, That Birth of the Holy Virgin is the ornament of all holy
virgins; and themselves together with Mary are mothers of Christ, if
they do the will of His Father. For Mary also is on this account the
Mother of Christ in a way more full of praise and blessing, according to
His sentence mentioned above. “Whosoever doeth the will of my Father Who
is in heaven, that one is to Me brother, and sister, and mother.” All
these degrees of nearness of kin to Himself, He shows forth in a
spiritual manner, in the People whom He hath redeemed: as brothers and
sisters He hath holy men and holy women, forasmuch as they all are
co-heirs in the heavenly inheritance. His mother is the whole Church,
because she herself assuredly gives birth to His members, that is, His
faithful ones. Also His mother is every pious soul, doing the will of
His Father with most fruitful charity, in them of whom it travaileth,
until Himself <span id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031) be formed in
them. Mary, therefore, doing the will of God, after the flesh, is only
the mother of Christ, but after the Spirit she is both His sister and
mother.
