<span id="iv.v-p3"></span>This tract was thought spurious by some, but
is known to be St. Augustin’s by his mention of it in Ep. ccxxxi.<span
id="iv.v-p3.1"></span> *ad Darium Comitem*. It seems to have been
written after 399, from what is said about Idols, § 10; for in that year
Honorius enacted laws against them.—*From Bened. Ed.*

<span id="iv.v-p4"></span>The reader of Butler’s Analogy will recognise
many similar turns of thought.
