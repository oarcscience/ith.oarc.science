<span id="v.v.ix"></span>

<span id="v.v.ix-p1"></span> 8. For this reason, from the books of the
New Testament, except the figurative pre-significations used by our
Lord, if thou consider the life and manners of the Saints, their actions
and sayings, nothing of the kind can be produced which should provoke to
imitation of lying. For the simulation of Peter and Barnabas is not only
recorded, but also reproved and corrected. <span
id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310.md) For it was not, as some
suppose, <span id="fr_2311"></span>[2312](#fn_2311.md) out of the same
simulation that even Paul the Apostle either circumcised Timothy, or
himself celebrated certain ceremonies <span
id="fr_2312"></span>[2313](#fn_2312.md) according to the Jewish rite; but
he did so, out of that liberty of his mind whereby he preached that
neither are the Gentiles the better for circumcision, nor the Jews the
worse. Wherefore he judged that neither the former should be tied to the
custom of the Jews, nor the Jews deterred from the custom of their
fathers. Whence are those words of his: “Is any man called being
circumcised let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in
uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and
uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.” <span
id="fr_2313"></span>[2314](#fn_2313.md) How can a man become uncircumcised
after circumcision? but let him not do so, saith he: let him not so live
as if he had become uncircumcised, that is, as if he had covered again
with flesh the part that was bared, and ceased to be a Jew; as in
another place he saith, “Thy circumcision is become
uncircumcision.” <span id="fr_2314"></span>[2315](#fn_2314.md) And this the
Apostle said, not as though he would compel either those to remain in
uncircumcision, or the Jews in the custom of their fathers: but that
neither these nor those should be forced to the other custom; and, each
should have power of abiding in his own custom, not necessity of so
doing. For neither if the Jew should wish, where it would disturb no
man, to recede from Jewish observances, would he be prohibited by the
Apostle, since the object of his counselling to abide therein was that
Jews might not by being troubled about superfluous things be hindered
from coming to those things which are necessary to salvation. Neither
would it be prohibited by him, if any of the Gentiles should wish to be
circumcised for the purpose of showing that he does not detest the same
as noxious, but holds it indifferently, as a seal, <span
id="fr_2315"></span>[2316](#fn_2315.md) the usefulness of which had already
passed away with time; for it did not follow that, if there were now no
salvation to be had from it, there was destruction to be dreaded
therefrom. And for this reason, Timothy, having been called in
uncircumcision, yet because his mother was a Jewess and he was bound, in
order to gain his kindred, to show them that he had not learnt in the
Christian discipline to abominate the sacraments of the old Law, was
circumcised by the Apostle; <span id="fr_2316"></span>[2317](#fn_2316.md)
that in this way they might prove to the Jews, that the reason why the
Gentiles do not receive them, is not that they are evil and were
perniciously observed by the Fathers, but because they are no longer
necessary to salvation after the advent of that so great Sacrament,
which through so long times the whole of that ancient Scripture in its
prophetical prefigurations did travail in birth withal. For he would
circumcise Titus also, when the Jews urged this, <span
id="fr_2317"></span>[2318](#fn_2317.md) but that false brethren, privily
brought in, wished it to be done to the intent they might have it to
disseminate concerning Paul himself as a token that he had given place
to the truth of their preaching, who said that the hope of Gospel
salvation is in circumcision of the flesh and observances of that kind,
and that without these Christ profiteth no man: whereas on the contrary
Christ would nothing profit them, who should be circumcised because they
thought that in it was salvation; whence that saying, “Behold, I Paul
say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you
nothing.” <span id="fr_2318"></span>[2319](#fn_2318.md) Out of this
liberty, therefore, did Paul keep the observances of his fathers, but
with this one precaution and express declaration, that people should not
suppose that without these was no Christian salvation. Peter, however,
by his making as though salvation consisted in Judaism, was compelling
the Gentiles to judaize; as is shown by Paul’s words, where he says,
“Why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?” <span
id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319.md) For they would be under no
compulsion unless they saw that he observed them in such manner as if
beside them could be no salvation. Peter’s simulation therefore is not
to be compared to Paul’s liberty. And while we ought to love Peter for
that he willingly received correction, we must not bolster up lying even
by the authority of Paul, who <span id="page_462">p. 462</span> <span
id="v.v.ix-Page_462"></span>both recalled Peter to the right path in the
presence of them all, lest the Gentiles through him should be compelled
to judaize; and bare witness to his own preaching, that whereas he was
accounted hostile to the traditions of the fathers in that he would not
impose them on the Gentiles, he did not despise to celebrate them
himself according to the custom of his fathers, and therein sufficiently
showed that this has remained in them at the Coming of Christ; that
neither to the Jews they are pernicious, nor to the Gentiles necessary,
nor henceforth to any of mankind means of salvation. <span
