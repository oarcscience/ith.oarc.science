<span id="v.vi.xiv-p1"></span> 13. Or haply is it so, that he who plots
in this way to find out Priscillianists, denies not Christ, forasmuch as
with his mouth he utters what with his heart he believes not? As if
truly (which I also said a little above) when it was said, “With the
heart man believeth unto righteousness,” it was added to no purpose,
“with the mouth confession is made unto salvation?” <span
id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397.md) Is it not so that almost all who
have denied Christ before the persecutors, held in their heart what they
believed of Him? And yet, by not confessing with the mouth unto
salvation, they perished, save they which through penitence have lived
again? Who can be so vain, <span id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398.md) as
to think that the Apostle Peter had that in his heart which he had on
his lips when he denied Christ? Surely in that denial he held the truth
within and uttered the lie without. Why then did he wash away with tears
the denial which he uttered with his mouth, if that sufficed for
salvation that with the heart he believed? Why, speaking the truth in
his heart, did he punish with so bitter weeping the lie which he brought
forth with his mouth, unless because he saw it to be a great and deadly
evil, that while with his heart he believed unto righteousness, with his
mouth he made not confession unto salvation?
