<span id="v.iii.xxviii-p1"></span> 27. Therefore go on, Saints of God,
boys and girls, males and females, unmarried men, and women; go on and
persevere unto the end. Praise more sweetly the Lord, Whom ye think on
more richly: hope more happily in Him, Whom ye serve more instantly:
love more ardently Him, whom ye please more attentively. With loins
girded, and lamps burning, wait for the Lord, when He cometh from the
marriage. <span id="fr_2074"></span>[2075](#fn_2074.md) Ye shall bring unto
the marriage of the Lamb a new song, which ye shall sing on your harps.
Not surely such as the whole earth singeth, unto which it is said, “Sing
unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, the whole earth” <span
id="fr_2075"></span>[2076](#fn_2075.md) : but such as no one shall be able
to utter but you. For thus there saw you in the Apocalypse a certain
one <span id="fr_2076"></span>[2077](#fn_2076.md) beloved above others by
the Lamb, who had been wont to lie on His breast, and who used to drink
in, and burst <span id="fr_2077"></span>[2078](#fn_2077.md) forth, the Word
of God above wonders of heaven. He saw you twelve times twelve thousand
of holy harpers, of undefiled virginity in body, of inviolate truth in
heart; and he wrote of you, that ye follow the Lamb whithersoever He
shall go. Where think we that This Lamb goeth, where no one either dares
or is able to follow save you? Where think we that He goeth? Into what
glades and meadows? Where, I think, the grass are joys; not vain joys of
this world, lying madnesses; nor joys such as shall be in the kingdom of
God itself, for the rest that are not virgins; but distinct from the
portion of joys of all the rest. Joy of the virgins of Christ, of
Christ, in Christ, with Christ, after Christ, through Christ, for
Christ. The joys peculiar to the virgins of Christ, are not the same as
of such as are not virgins, although of Christ. For there are to
different persons different joys, but to none such. Go (enter) into
these, follow the Lamb, because the Flesh of the Lamb also is assuredly
virgin. For this He retained in Himself when grown up, which He took not
away from His Mother by His conception and birth. Follow Him, as ye
deserve, <span id="fr_2078"></span>[2079](#fn_2078.md) in virginity of
heart and flesh, wheresoever He shall have gone. For what is it to
follow, but to imitate? Because “Christ hath suffered for us,” <span
id="fr_2079"></span>[2080](#fn_2079.md) leaving us an example, as saith the
Apostle Peter, “that we should follow His steps.” Him each one follows
in that, wherein he imitates Him: not so far forth as He is the only Son
of God, by Whom all things were made; but so far forth as, the Son of
Man, He set forth in Himself, what behoved for us to imitate. And many
things in Him are set forth for all to imitate: but virginity of the
flesh not for all; for they have not what to do in order to be virgins,
in whom it hath been already brought to pass that they be not virgins.
