<span id="v.viii.ii-p1"></span> 1. <span class="c19"><span
id="v.viii.ii-p1.1"></span> That</span> virtue of the mind which is
called Patience, is so great a gift of God, that even in Him who
bestoweth the same upon us, that, whereby He waiteth for evil men that
they may amend, is set forth by the name of Patience, \[or
long-suffering.\] So, although in God there can be no suffering, <span
id="fr_2626"></span>[2627](#fn_2626.md) and “patience” hath its name *a
patiendo*, from suffering, yet a patient God we not only faithfully
believe, but also wholesomely confess. But the patience of God, of what
kind and how great it is, His, Whom we say to be impassible, <span
id="fr_2627"></span>[2628](#fn_2627.md) yet not impatient, nay even most
patient, in words to unfold this who can be able? Ineffable is therefore
that patience, as is His jealousy, as His wrath, and whatever there is
like to these. For if we conceive of these as they be in us, in Him are
there none. We, namely, can feel none of these without molestation: but
be it far from us to surmise that the impassible nature of God is liable
to any molestation. But like as He is jealous without any darkening of
spirit, <span id="fr_2628"></span>[2629](#fn_2628.md) wroth without any
perturbation, pitiful without any pain, repenteth Him without any
wrongness in Him to be set right; so is He patient without aught of
passion. Now therefore as concerning human patience, which we are able
to conceive and beholden to have, of what sort it is, I will, as God
granteth and the brevity of the present discourse alloweth, essay to set
forth.
