<span id="iv.vii.xvii-p1"></span> 17. We believe also “the resurrection
of the flesh,” which went before in Christ: that the body too may have
hope of that which went before in its Head. The Head of the Church,
Christ: the Church, the body of Christ. Our Head is risen, ascended into
heaven: where the Head, there also the members. In what way the
resurrection of the flesh? Lest any should chance to think it like as
Lazarus’s resurrection, that thou mayest know it to be not so, it is
added, “Into life everlasting.” God regenerate you! God preserve and
keep you! God bring you safe unto Himself, Who is the Life Everlasting.
Amen.
