<span id="iv.i.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—What is to Be Said
Thereupon.</span>

<span id="iv.i.v.ii-p2"></span>4. Let us, then, continue our inquiry now
in order. For under the second head in that division the question
occurred, whether the creature was formed for that work only, wherein
God, in such way as He then judged it to be fitting, might be manifested
to human sight; or whether angels, who already existed, were so sent as
to speak in the person of God, assuming a corporeal appearance from the
corporeal creature for the purpose of their ministry; or else changing
and turning their own body itself, to which they are not subject, but
govern it as subject to themselves, into whatever forms they would, that
were appropriate and fit for their actions, according to the power given
to them by the Creator. And when this part of the question shall have
been investigated, so far as God permit, then, last<span id="page_57">p.
57</span> <span id="iv.i.v.ii-Page_57"></span>ly, we shall have to see
to that question with which we started, *viz*., whether the Son and the
Holy Spirit were also “sent” before; and if it be so, then what
difference there is between that sending and the one of which we read in
the Gospel; or whether neither of them were sent, except when either the
Son was made of the Virgin Mary, or when the Holy Spirit appeared in a
visible form, whether as a dove or in tongues of fire. <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357)

<span id="iv.i.v.ii-p4"></span>5. I confess, however, that it reaches
further than my purpose can carry me to inquire whether the angels,
secretly working by the spiritual quality of their body abiding still in
them, assume somewhat from the inferior and more bodily elements, which,
being fitted to themselves, they may change and turn like a garment into
any corporeal appearances they will, and those appearances themselves
also real, as real water was changed by our Lord into real wine; <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358) or whether they transform their own
bodies themselves into that which they would, suitably to the particular
act. But it does not signify to the present question which of these it
is. And although I be not able to understand these things by actual
experience, seeing that I am a man, as the angels do who do these
things, and know them better than I know them, *viz*., how far my body
is changeable by the operation of my will; whether it be by my own
experience of myself, or by that which I have gathered from others; yet
it is not necessary here to say which of these alternatives I am to
believe upon the authority of the divine Scriptures, lest I be compelled
to prove it, and so my discourse become too long upon a subject which
does not concern the present question.

<span id="iv.i.v.ii-p6"></span>6. Our present inquiry then is, whether
the angels were then the agents both in showing those bodily appearances
to the eyes of men and in sounding those words in their ears when the
sensible creature itself, serving the Creator at His beck, was turned
for the time into whatever was needful; as it is written in the book of
Wisdom, “For the creature serveth Thee, who art the Maker, increaseth
his strength against the unrighteous for their punishment, and abateth
his strength for the benefit of such as put their trust in Thee.
Therefore, even then was it altered into all fashions, and was obedient
to Thy grace, that nourisheth all things according to the desire of them
that longed for Thee.” <span id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359) For the
power of the will of God reaches through the spiritual creature even to
visible and sensible effects of the corporeal creature. For where does
not the wisdom of the omnipotent God work that which He wills, which
“reacheth from one end to another mightily, and sweetly doth order all
things”? <span id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360)
