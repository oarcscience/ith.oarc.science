married to compare themselves with the deserts of the continent, in that
of them virgins are born: for this is not a good of marriage, but of
nature: which was so ordered of God, as that of every sexual intercourse
whatever of the two sexes of human kind, whether in due order and
honest, or base and unlawful, there is born no female save a virgin, yet
is none born a sacred virgin: so it is brought to pass that a virgin is
born even of fornication, but a sacred virgin not even of marriage.
