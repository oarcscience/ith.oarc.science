<span id="v.ii.xvii-p1"></span> 16. Therefore if haply, (which whether
it can take place, I know not; and rather think it cannot take place;
but yet, if haply), having taken unto himself a concubine for a time, a
man shall have sought sons only from this same intercourse; neither thus
is that union to be preferred to the marriage even of those women, who
do this, that is matter of pardon. <span
id="fr_1980"></span>[1981](#fn_1980.md) For we must consider what belongs
to marriage, not what belongs to such women as marry and use marriage
with less moderation than they ought. For neither if each one so use
lands entered upon unjustly and wrongly, as out of their fruits to give
large alms, doth he therefore justify rapine: nor if another brood over,
through avarice, an estate to which he has succeeded, or which he hath
justly gained, are we on this account to blame the rule of civil law,
whereby he is made a lawful owner. Nor will the wrongfulness of a
tyrannical rebellion deserve praise, if the tyrant treat his subjects
with royal clemency: nor will the order of royal power deserve blame, if
a king rage with tyrannical cruelty. For it is one thing to wish to use
well unjust power, and it is another thing to use unjustly just power.
Thus neither do concubines taken for a time, if they be such in order to
sons, make their concubinage lawful; nor do married women, if they live
wantonly with their husbands, attach any charge to the order of
marriage.
