<span id="iv.vi.vi-p1"></span> 5. All that Scripture therefore, which is
called the Old Testament, is handed down fourfold to them who desire to
know it, according to history, according to ætiology, according to
analogy, according to allegory. Do not think me silly for using Greek
words. In the first place, because I have so received, nor do I dare to
make known to you otherwise than I have received. Next you yourself
perceive, that we have not in use terms for such things: and had I
translated and made such, I should have been indeed more silly: but,
were I to use circumlocution, I should be less free in treating: this
only I pray you to believe, that in whatever way I err, I am not
inflated or swollen in any thing that I do. Thus (for example) it is
handed down according to history, when there is taught what hath been
written, or what hath been done; what not done, but only written as
though it had been done. According to ætiology, when it is shown for
what cause any thing hath been done or said. According to analogy, when
it is shown that the two Testaments, the Old and the New, are not
contrary the one to the other. According to allegory, when it is taught
that certain things which have been written are not to be taken in the
letter, but are to be understood in a figure.
