<span id="v.v.xlii-p1"></span> 41. There resulteth then from all these
this sentence, that a lie which doth not violate the doctrine of piety,
nor piety itself, nor innocence, nor benevolence, may on behalf of
pudicity of body be admitted. And yet if any man should propose to
himself so to love truth, not only that which consists in contemplation,
but also in uttering the true thing, which each in its own kind of
things is true, and no otherwise to bring forth with the mouth of the
body his thought than in the mind it is conceived and beheld; so that he
should prize the beauty of truth-telling honesty, not only above gold
and silver and jewels and pleasant lands, but above this temporal life
itself altogether and every good thing of the body, I know not whether
any could wisely say that that man errs. And if he should prefer this
and prize it more than all that himself hath of such things; rightly
also would he prefer it to the temporal things of other men, whom by his
innocence and benevolence he was bound to keep and to help. For he would
love perfect faith, not only of believing aright those things which by
an excellent authority and worthy of faith should to himself be spoken,
but also of faith<span id="page_476">p. 476</span> <span
id="v.v.xlii-Page_476"></span>fully uttering what himself should judge
right to be spoken, and should speak. For faith hath its name in the
Latin tongue, from that the thing is done which is said: <span
id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376.md) and thus it is manifest that one
doth not exhibit when telling a lie. And even if this faith be less
violated, when one lies in such sort that he is believed to no
inconvenience and no pernicious hurt, with added intention moreover of
guarding either one’s life or corporal purity; yet violated it is, and a
thing is violated which ought to be kept safe in chastity and sanctity
of mind. Whence we are constrained, not by opinion of men, which for the
most part is in error, but by truth itself, truth which is eminent above
all, and alone is most invincible, to prefer even to purity of body,
perfect faith. For chastity of mind is, love well ordered, which does
not place the greater below the smaller. Now it is less, whatever in the
body than whatever in the mind can be violated. For assuredly when for
corporal chasteness a man tells a lie, he sees indeed that his body is
threatened with corruption, not from his own, but from another’s lust,
but is cautious lest by permitting at least, he be a party. That
permission, however, where is it but in the mind? So then, even corporal
chasteness cannot be corrupted but in the mind; which not consenting nor
permitting, it can by no means be rightly said that corporal chasteness
is violated whatever in the body be perpetrated by another’s lust.
Whence it is gathered, that much more must the chastity of the mind be
preserved in the mind, in the which is the guardianship of the pudicity
of the body. Wherefore, what in us lies, both the one and the other must
by holy manners and conversation be walled and hedged round, lest from
another quarter it be violated. But when both cannot be, which is to be
slighted in comparison of which, who doth not see? when he seeth which
to which is to be preferred, the mind to the body, or the body to the
mind; and which is more to be shunned among sins, the permitting of
another’s deed, or the committing of the deed thyself.
