<span id="v.ii.xxiv-p1"></span> 23. Nor, in that the Law orders a man to
be purified even after intercourse with a wife, doth it show it to be
sin: unless it be that which is allowed by way of pardon, which also,
being in excess, hinders prayers. But, as the Law sets <span
id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998.md) many things in sacraments and
shadows of things to come; a certain as it were material formless state
of the seed, which having received form will hereafter produce the body
of man, is set to signify a life formless, and untaught: from which
formless state, forasmuch as it behoves that man be cleansed by form and
teaching of learning; as a sign of this, that purification was ordered
after the emission of seed. For neither in sleep also doth it take place
through sin. And yet there also a purification was commanded. Or, if any
think this also to be sin, thinking that it comes not to pass save from
some lust of this kind, which without doubt is false; what? are the
ordinary menses also of women sins? And yet from these the same old Law
commanded that they should be cleansed by expiation; for no other cause,
save the material formless state itself, in that which, when conception
hath taken place, is added as it were to build up the body, and for this
reason, when it flows without form, the Law would have signified by it a
soul without form of discipline, flowing and loose in an unseemly
manner. And that this ought to receive form, it signifies, when it
commands such flow of the body to be purified. Lastly, what? to die, is
that also a sin? or, to bury a dead person, is it not also a good work
of humanity? and yet a purification was commanded even on occasion of
this also; because also a dead body, life abandoning it, is not sin, but
signifies the sin of a soul abandoned by righteousness. <span
