<span id="iv.i.iv.xvi"></span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—Of the Appearance on Sinai.
Whether the Trinity Spake in that Appearance or Some One Person
Specially.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p2"></span>25. But now of the clouds, and voices,
and lightnings, and the trumpet, and the smoke on Mount Sinai, when it
was said, “And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord
descended upon it in fire, and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke
of a furnace; and all the people that was in the camp trembled; and when
the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder, Moses
spake, and God answered him by a voice.” <span
id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296) And a little after, when the Law had
been given in the ten commandments, it follows in the text, “And all the
people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the
trumpet, and the mountain smoking.” And a little after, “And \[when the
people saw it,\] they removed and stood afar off, and Moses drew near
unto the thick darkness <span id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297) where
God was, and the Lord said unto Moses,” <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298) etc. What shall I say about this, save
that no one can be so insane as to believe the smoke, and the fire, and
the cloud, and the darkness, and whatever there was of the kind, to be
the substance of the word and wisdom of God which is Christ, or of the
Holy Spirit? For not even the Arians ever dared to say that they were
the substance of God the Father. All these things, then, were wrought
through the creature serving the Creator, and were presented in a
suitable economy (*dispensatio*) to human senses; unless, perhaps,
because it is said, “And Moses drew near to the cloud where God was,”
carnal thoughts must needs suppose that the cloud was indeed seen by the
people, but that within the cloud Moses with the eyes of the flesh saw
the Son of God, whom doting heretics will have to be seen in His own
substance. Forsooth, Moses may have seen Him with the eyes of the flesh,
if not only the wisdom of God which is Christ, but even that of any man
you please and howsoever wise, can be seen with the eyes of the flesh;
or if, because it is written of the elders of Israel, that “they saw the
place where the God of Israel had stood,” and that “there was under His
feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the
body of heaven in his clearness,” <span
id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299) therefore we are to believe that the
word and wisdom of God in His own substance stood within the space of an
earthly place, who indeed “reacheth firmly from end to end, and sweetly
ordereth all things;” <span id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300) and that
the Word of God, by whom all things were made, <span
id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301) is in such wise changeable, as now to
contract, now to expand Himself; (may the Lord cleanse the hearts of His
faithful ones from such thoughts!) But indeed all these visible and
sensible things are, as we have often said, exhibited through the
creature made subject in order to signify the invisible and intelligible
God, not only the Father, but also the Son and the Holy Spirit, “of whom
are all things, and through whom are all things, and in whom are all
things;” <span id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302) although “the invisible
things of God, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and
Godhead.” <span id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p11"></span>26. But as far as concerns our present
undertaking, neither on Mount Sinai do I see how it appears, by all
those things which were fearfully displayed to the senses of mortal men,
whether God the Trinity spake, or the Father, or the Son, or the Holy
Spirit severally. But if it is allowable, without rash assertion, to
venture upon a modest and hesitating conjecture from this passage, if it
is possible to understand it of one person of the Trinity, why do we not
rather understand the Holy Spirit to be spoken of, since the Law itself
also, which was given there, is said to have been written upon tables of
stone with the <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.xvi-Page_50"></span>finger of God, <span
id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304) by which name we know the Holy Spirit
to be signified in the Gospel. <span id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305)
And fifty days are numbered from the slaying of the lamb and the
celebration of the Passover until the day in which these things began to
be done in Mount Sinai; just as after the passion of our Lord fifty days
are numbered from His resurrection, and then came the Holy Spirit which
the Son of God had promised. And in that very coming of His, which we
read of in the Acts of the Apostles, there appeared cloven tongues like
as of fire, and it sat upon each of them: <span
id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306) which agrees with Exodus, where it is
written, “And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord
descended upon it in fire;” and a little after, “And the sight of the
glory of the Lord,” he says, “was like devouring fire on the top of the
mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.” <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307) Or if these things were therefore
wrought because neither the Father nor the Son could be there presented
in that mode without the Holy Spirit, by whom the Law itself must needs
be written; then we know doubtless that God appeared there, not by His
own substance, which remains invisible and unchangeable, but by the
appearance above mentioned of the creature; but that some special person
of the Trinity appeared, distinguished by a proper mark, as far as my
capacity of understanding reaches, we do not see.
