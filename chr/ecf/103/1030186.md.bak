<span id="iv.i.xv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—Blessedness Cannot Exist
Without Immortality.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xv.viii-p2"></span>11. As, therefore, all men will to be
blessed, certainly, if they will truly, they will also to be immortal;
for otherwise they could not be blessed. And further, if questioned also
concerning immortality, as before concerning blessedness, all reply that
they will <span id="page_173">p. 173</span> <span
id="iv.i.xv.viii-Page_173"></span>it. But blessedness of what quality
soever, such as is not so, but rather is so called, is sought, nay
indeed is feigned in this life, whilst immortality is despaired of,
without which true blessedness cannot be. Since he lives blessedly, as
we have already said before, and have sufficiently proved and concluded,
who lives as he wills, and wills nothing wrongly. But no one wrongly
wills immortality, if human nature is by God’s gift capable of it; and
if it is not capable of it, it is not capable of blessedness. For, that
a man may live blessedly, he must needs live. And if life quits him by
his dying, how can a blessed life remain with him? And when it quits
him, without doubt it either quits him unwilling, or willing, or
neither. If unwilling, how is the life blessed which is so within his
will as not to be within his power? And whereas no one is blessed who
wills something that he does not have, how much less is he blessed who
is quitted against his will, not by honor, nor by possessions, nor by
any other thing, but by the blessed life itself, since he will have no
life at all? And hence, although no feeling is left for his life to be
thereby miserable (for the blessed life quits him, because life
altogether quits him), yet he is wretched as long as he feels, because
he knows that against his will that is being destroyed for the sake of
which he loves all else, and which he loves beyond all else. A life
therefore cannot both be blessed, and yet quit a man against his will,
since no one becomes blessed against his will; and hence how much more
does it make a man miserable by quitting him against his will, when it
would make him miserable if he had it against his will! But if it quit
him with his will, even so how was that a blessed life, which he who had
it willed should perish? It remains then for them to say, that neither
of these is in the mind of the blessed man; that is, that he is neither
unwilling nor willing to be quitted by a blessed life, when through
death life quits him altogether; for that he stands firm with an even
heart, prepared alike for either alternative. But neither is that a
blessed life which is such as to be unworthy of his love whom it makes
blessed. For how is that a blessed life which the blessed man does not
love? Or how is that loved, of which it is received indifferently,
whether it is to flourish or to perish? Unless perhaps the virtues,
which we love in this way on account of blessedness alone, venture to
persuade us that we do not love blessedness itself. Yet if they did
this, we should certainly leave off loving the virtues themselves, when
we do not love that on account of which alone we loved them. And
further, how will that opinion be true, which has been so tried, and
sifted, and thoroughly strained, and is so certain, *viz.* that all men
will to be blessed, if they themselves who are already blessed neither
will nor do not will to be blessed? Or if they will it, as truth
proclaims, as nature constrains, in which indeed the supremely good and
unchangeably blessed Creator has implanted that will: if, I say, they
will to be blessed who are blessed, certainly they do not will to be not
blessed. But if they do not will not to be blessed, without doubt they
do not will to be annihilated and perish in regard to their blessedness.
But they cannot be blessed except they are alive; therefore they do not
will so to perish in regard to their life. Therefore, whoever are either
truly blessed or desire to be so, will to be immortal. But he does not
live blessedly who has not that which he wills. Therefore it follows
that in no way can life be truly blessed unless it be eternal.
