<span id="iv.i.xiii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xiii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—The Trinity of the Outer Man, or
of External Vision, is Not an Image of God. The Likeness of God is
Desired Even in Sins. In External Vision the Form of the Corporeal Thing
is as It Were the Parent, Vision the Offspring; But the Will that Unites
These Suggests the Holy Spirit.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xiii.v-p2"></span>8. But as, when \[both\] the form and
species of a body have perished, the will cannot recall to it the sense
of perceiving; so, when the image which memory bears is blotted out by
forgetfulness, the will will be unable to force <span id="page_149">p.
149</span> <span id="iv.i.xiii.v-Page_149"></span>back the eye of the
mind by recollection, so as to be formed thereby. But because the mind
has great power to imagine not only things forgotten, but also things
that it never saw, or experienced, either by increasing, or diminishing,
or changing, or compounding, after its pleasure, those which have not
dropped out of its remembrance, it often imagines things to be such as
either it knows they are not, or does not know that they are. And in
this case we have to take care, lest it either speak falsely that it may
deceive, or hold an opinion so as to be deceived. And if it avoid these
two evils, then imagined phantasms do not hinder it: just as sensible
things experienced or retained by memory do not hinder it, if they are
neither passionately sought for when pleasant, nor basely shunned when
unpleasant. But when the will leaves better things, and greedily wallows
in these, then it becomes unclean; and they are so thought of hurtfully,
when they are present, and also more hurtfully when they are absent. And
he therefore lives badly and degenerately who lives according to the
trinity of the *outer* man; because it is the purpose of using things
sensible and corporeal, that has begotten also that trinity, which
although it imagines within, yet imagines things without. For no one
could use those things even well, unless the images of things perceived
by the senses were retained in the memory. And unless the will for the
greatest part dwells in the higher and interior things, and unless that
will itself, which is accommodated either to bodies without, or to the
images of them within, refers whatever it receives in them to a better
and truer life, and rests in that end by gazing at which it judges that
those things ought to be done; what else do we do, but that which the
apostle prohibits us from doing, when he says, “Be not conformed to this
world”? <span id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md) And therefore that
trinity is not an image of God since it is produced in the mind itself
through the bodily sense, from the lowest, that is, the corporeal
creature, than which the mind is higher. Yet neither is it altogether
dissimilar: for what is there that has not a likeness of God, in
proportion to its kind and measure, seeing that God made all things very
good, <span id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md) and for no other reason
except that He Himself is supremely good? In so far, therefore, as
anything that is, is good, in so far plainly it has still some likeness
of the supreme good, at however great a distance; and if a natural
likeness, then certainly a right and well-ordered one; but if a faulty
likeness, then certainly a debased and perverse one. For even souls in
their very sins strive after nothing else but some kind of likeness of
God, in a proud and preposterous, and, so to say, slavish liberty. So
neither could our first parents have been persuaded to sin unless it had
been said, “Ye shall be as gods.” <span
id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md) No doubt every thing in the creatures
which is in any way like God, is not also to be called His image; but
that alone than which He Himself alone is higher. For that only is in
all points copied from Him, between which and Himself no nature is
interposed.

<span id="iv.i.xiii.v-p6"></span>9. Of that vision then; that is, of the
form which is wrought in the sense of him who sees; the form of the
bodily thing from which it is wrought, is, as it were, the parent. But
it is not a true parent; whence neither is that a true offspring; for it
is not altogether born therefrom, since something else is applied to the
bodily thing in order that it may be formed from it, namely, the sense
of him who sees. And for this reason, to love this is to be
estranged. <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736.md) Therefore the will
which unites both, *viz*. the quasi-parent and the quasi-child, is more
spiritual than either of them. For that bodily thing which is discerned,
is not spiritual at all. But the vision which comes into existence in
the sense, has something spiritual mingled with it, since it cannot come
into existence without the soul. But it is not wholly spiritual; since
that which is formed is a sense of the body. Therefore the will which
unites both is confessedly more spiritual, as I have said; and so it
begins to suggest (*insinuare*), as it were, the person of the Spirit in
the Trinity. But it belongs more to the sense that is formed, than to
the bodily thing whence it is formed. For the sense and will of an
animate being belongs to the soul, not to the stone or other bodily
thing that is seen. It does not therefore proceed from that bodily thing
as from a parent; yet neither does it proceed from that other as it were
offspring, namely, the vision and form that is in the sense. For the
will existed before the vision came to pass, which will applied the
sense that was to be formed to the bodily thing that was to be
discerned; but it was not yet satisfied. For how could that which was
not yet seen satisfy? And satisfaction means a will that rests content.
And, therefore, we can neither call the will the quasi-offspring of
vision, since it existed before vision; nor the quasi-parent, since that
vision was not formed and expressed <span id="page_150">p. 150</span>
<span id="iv.i.xiii.v-Page_150"></span>from the will, but from the
bodily thing that was seen.
