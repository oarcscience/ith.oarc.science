<span id="iv.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—Of the Son of God, and His Peculiar
Designation as the Word.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p2"></span>—Since this is the case, I repeat, we
be<span id="page_323">p. 323</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv-Page_323"></span>lieve also in <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.iv.iv-p2.1"></span>Jesus Christ</span>, the <span
class="c19"><span id="iv.iv.iv-p2.2"></span>Son</span> of <span
class="c19"><span id="iv.iv.iv-p2.3"></span>God</span> the <span
class="c19"><span id="iv.iv.iv-p2.4"></span> Only-Begotten</span> of the
<span class="c19"><span id="iv.iv.iv-p2.5"></span>Father</span>, that is
to say, <span class="c19"><span id="iv.iv.iv-p2.6"></span>His Only
Son</span>, our <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.iv.iv-p2.7"></span>Lord</span>. This Word however, we ought not
to apprehend merely in the sense in which we think of our own words,
which are given forth by the voice and the mouth, and strike the air and
pass on, and subsist no longer than their sound continues. For that Word
remains unchangeably: for of this very Word was it spoken when of Wisdom
it was said, “Remaining in herself, she maketh all things new.” <span
id="fr_1532"></span>[1533](#fn_1532.md) Moreover, the reason of His being
named the Word of the Father, is that the Father is made known by Him.
Accordingly, just as it is our intention, when we speak truth, that by
means of our words our mind should be made known to him who hears us,
and that whatever we carry in secrecy in our heart may be set forth by
means of signs of this sort for the intelligent understanding of another
individual; so this Wisdom that God the Father begot is most
appropriately named His Word, inasmuch as the most hidden Father is made
known to worthy minds by the same. <span
id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p5"></span>4. Now there is a very great difference
between our mind and those words of ours, by which we endeavor to set
forth the said mind. We indeed do not beget intelligible words, <span
id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534.md) but we form them; and in the
forming of them the body is the underlying material. Between mind and
body, however, there is the greatest difference. But God, when He begot
the Word, begot that which He is Himself. Neither out of nothing, nor of
any material already made and founded did He then beget; but He begot of
Himself that which He is Himself. For we too aim at this when we speak,
(as we shall see) if we carefully consider the inclination <span
id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535.md) of our will; not when we lie, but
when we speak the truth. For to what else do we direct our efforts then,
but to bring our own very mind, if it can be done at all, in upon the
mind of the hearer, with the view of its being apprehended and
thoroughly discerned by him; so that we may indeed abide in our very
selves, and make no retreat from ourselves, and yet at the same time put
forth a sign of such a nature as that by it a knowledge of us <span
id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536.md) may be effected in another
individual; that thus, so far as the faculty is granted us, another mind
may be, as it were, put forth by the mind, whereby it may disclose
itself? This we do, making the attempt <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537.md) both by words, and by the simple
sound of the voice, and by the countenance, and by the gestures of the
body,—by so many contrivances, in sooth, desiring to make patent that
which is within; inasmuch as we are not able to put forth aught of this
nature \[in itself completely\]: and thus it is that the mind of the
speaker cannot become perfectly known; thus also it results that a place
is open for falsehoods. God the Father, on the other hand, who possessed
both the will and the power to declare Himself with the utmost truth to
minds designed to obtain knowledge of Him, with the purpose of thus
declaring Himself begot this \[Word\] which He Himself is who did beget;
which \[Person\] is likewise called His Power and Wisdom, <span
id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md) inasmuch as it is by Him that He
has wrought all things, and in order disposed them; of whom these words
are for this reason spoken: “She (Wisdom) reacheth from one end to
another mightily, and sweetly doth she order all things.” <span
id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539.md)
