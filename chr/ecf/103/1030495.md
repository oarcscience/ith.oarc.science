<span id="v.i.xii-p1"></span> 12. When, therefore, you hear it said,
“Sin shall not reign over you;” <span
id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850.md) have not thou confidence of
thyself, that sin reign not over thee, but of Him, unto Whom a certain
Saint saith in prayer, “Direct my paths after Thy Word, and let no
iniquity have dominion over me.” <span
id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851.md) For lest haply, after that we had
heard, “sin shall not reign over you,” we should lift up ourselves, and
lay this to our own strength, straightway the Apostle saw this, and
added, “For ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.” Therefore, Grace
causeth that sin reign not over you. Do not thou, therefore, have
confidence of thyself, lest it thence reign much more over thee. And,
when we hear it said, “If by the Spirit ye shall mortify the deeds of
the flesh, ye shall live,” <span id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md)
let us not lay this so great good unto our own spirit, as though of
itself it can do this. For, in order that we should not entertain that
carnal sense, the spirit being dead rather than that which putteth
others to death, straightway he added, “For as many as are led by the
Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” <span
id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md) Therefore that by our spirit we may
mortify the works of the flesh, we are led by the Spirit of God, Who
gives Continence, whereby to curb, tame, overcome lust.
