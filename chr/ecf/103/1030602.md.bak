<span id="v.iii.xlix-p1"></span> 48. What now shall I say concerning the
very carefulness and watchfulness against sin? “Who shall boast that he
hath a chaste heart? or who shall boast that he is clean from
sin?” <span id="fr_2199"></span>[2200](#fn_2199.md) Holy virginity is
indeed inviolate from the mother’s womb; but “no one,” saith he, “is
clean in Thy sight, not even the infant whose life is of one day upon
the earth.” <span id="fr_2200"></span>[2201](#fn_2200.md) There is kept
also in faith inviolate a certain virginal chastity, whereby the Church
is joined as a chaste virgin unto One Husband: but That One Husband hath
taught, not only the faithful who are virgin in mind and body, but all
Christians altogether, from spiritual even unto carnal, from Apostles
even unto the last penitents, as though from the height of heaven even
unto the bounds of it, <span id="fr_2201"></span>[2202](#fn_2201.md) to
pray, and in the prayer itself hath admonished them to say, “And forgive
us our debts, even as we also forgive our debtors:” <span
id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202.md) where, by this which we seek, He
shews what also we should remember that we are. For neither on behalf of
those debts, which for our whole past life we trust have been forgiven
unto us in Baptism through His peace, hath He charged us to pray,
saying, “And forgive us our debts, even as we also forgive our debtors:”
otherwise this were a prayer which Catechumens rather ought to pray up
to the time of Baptism; but whereas it is what baptized persons pray,
rulers and people, pastors and flocks; it is sufficiently shown that in
this life, the whole of which is a trial, no one ought to boast himself
as though free from all sins. <span id="fr_2203"></span>[2204](#fn_2203.md)
