<span id="v.vii.i-p2"></span>To write the Book on the Work of Monks, the
need which compelled me was this. When at Carthage there had begun to be
monasteries, some maintained themselves by their own hands, obeying the
Apostle; but others wished so to live on the oblations of the faithful,
that doing no work whence they might either have or supply the
necessaries of life, they thought and boasted that they did rather
fulfill the precept of the Gospel, where the Lord saith, *Behold the
fowls of heaven, and the lilies of the field*, ([Matt. vi.
26](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#026)<span id="v.vii.i-p2.1"></span>).
Whence also among laics of inferior purpose, but yet fervent in zeal,
there had begun to arise tumultuous contests, whereby the Church was
troubled, some defending the one, others the other part. Add to this,
that some of them who were for not working, wore their hair long. Whence
contentions between those who reprehended and those who justified the
practice, were, according to their party affections, increased. On these
accounts the venerable old Aurelius, Bishop of the Church of the same
city, desired me to write somewhat of this matter; and I did so. This
Book begins, “Jussioni tuæ, sancte frater Aureli.”

<span id="v.vii.i-p3"></span>This work is placed in the *Retractations*
next after that “On the Good of Marriage” which belongs to the year 401.
