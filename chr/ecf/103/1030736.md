<span id="v.vii.v-p1"></span> 4. First then we ought to demonstrate that
the blessed Apostle Paul willed the servants of God to work corporal
works which should have as their end a great spiritual reward, for this
purpose that they should need food and clothing of no man, but with
their own hands should procure these for themselves: then, to show that
those evangelical precepts from which some cherish not only their sloth
but even arrogance, are not contrary to the Apostolical precept and
example. Let us see then whence the Apostle came to this, that he should
say, “If any will not work, neither let him eat,” and what he thereupon
joineth on, that from the very context <span
id="fr_2480"></span>[2481](#fn_2480.md) of this lesson may appear his
declared sentence. “We command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that
walketh unquietly, and not according to the tradition which they have
received <span id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481.md) of us. For
yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us; for we were not unquiet
among you, neither ate we bread of any man for nought, but in labor and
travail night and day working that we might not burden any of you: not
for that we have not power, but that we might give ourselves as a
pattern to you in which ye should imitate us. For also when we were with
you, we gave you this charge, that if any will not work, let him not
eat. For we have heard that certain among you walk unquietly, working
not at all, but being busy-bodies. Now them that are such we charge and
beseech in our Lord Jesus Christ, that with silence they work, and eat
their own bread.” <span id="fr_2482"></span>[2483](#fn_2482.md) What can be
said to these things, since, that none might thereafter have license to
interpret this according to his wish, not according to charity, he by
his own example hath taught what by precept he hath enjoined? To him,
namely, as to an Apostle, a preacher of the Gospel, a soldier of Christ,
a planter of the vineyard, a shepherd of the flock had the Lord
appointed that he should live by the Gospel; and yet himself exacted not
the pay which was his due, that he might make himself a pattern to them
which desired what was not their due; as he saith to the Corinthians,
“Who goeth a warfare at any time at his own charges? Who planteth a
vineyard, and of its fruit eateth not? Who feedeth a flock, and of the
milk of the flock partaketh not?” <span
id="fr_2483"></span>[2484](#fn_2483.md) Therefore, what was due to him, he
would not receive, that by his example they might be checked, who,
although not so ordained in the Church, did deem the like to be due to
themselves. For what is it that he saith, “Neither ate we bread of any
man for naught, but in labor and travail night and day working that we
might not burden any of you; not for that we have not power, but that we
might give ourselves as a pattern to you wherein ye should follow us?”
Let them, therefore, hear to whom he hath given this precept, that is,
they which have not this power which he had, to wit, that while only
spiritually working they should eat bread by corporal labor not
earned: <span id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484.md) and as he says, “We
charge and beseech in Christ that with silence they work and eat their
own bread,” let them not dispute against the most manifest words of the
Apostle, because this also pertaineth to that “silence” with which they
ought to work and eat their own bread.
