id="iv.ii.lxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 69.—It is Not Impossible that Some
Believers May Pass Through a Purgatorial Fire in the Future Life.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxi-p2"></span>And it is not impossible that something
of the same kind may take place even after this life. It is a matter
that may be inquired into, and either ascertained or left doubtful,
whether some believers shall pass through a kind of purgatorial fire,
and in proportion as they have loved with more or less devotion the
goods that perish, be less or more quickly delivered from it. This
cannot, however, be the case of any of those of whom it is said, that
they “shall not inherit the kingdom of God,” <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225.md) unless after suitable repentance
their sins be forgiven them. When I say “suitable,” I mean that they are
not to be unfruitful in almsgiving; for Holy Scripture lays so much
stress on this virtue, that our Lord tells us beforehand, that He will
ascribe no merit to those on His right hand but that they abound in it,
and no defect to those on His left hand but their want of it, when He
shall say to the former, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
kingdom,” and to the latter, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire.” <span id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226.md)
