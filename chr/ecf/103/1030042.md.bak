<span id="iv.i.v.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.v.i-p1.1"></span>Preface.—Why Augustin Writes of the Trinity.
What He Claims from Readers. What Has Been Said in the Previous
Book.</span>

<span id="iv.i.v.i-p2"></span>1. I <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.v.i-p2.1"></span>Would</span> have them believe, who are
willing to do so, that I had rather bestow labor in reading, than in
dictating what others may read. But let those who will not believe this,
but are both able and willing to make the trial, grant me whatever
answers may be gathered from reading, either to my own inquiries, or to
those interrogations of others, which for the character I bear in the
service of Christ, and for the zeal with which I burn that our faith may
be fortified against the error of carnal and natural men, <span
id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md) I must needs bear with; and then let
them see how easily I would refrain from this labor, and with how much
even of joy I would give my pen a holiday. But if what we have read upon
these subjects is either not sufficiently set forth, or is not to be
found at all, or at any rate cannot easily be found by us, in the Latin
tongue, while we are not so familiar with the Greek tongue as to be
found in any way competent to read and understand therein the books that
treat of such topics, in which class of writings, to judge by the little
which has been translated for us, I do not doubt that everything is
contained that we can profitably seek; <span
id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md) while yet I cannot resist my brethren
when they exact of me, by that law by which I am made their servant,
that I should minister above all to their praiseworthy studies in Christ
by my tongue and by my pen, of which two yoked together in me, Love is
the charioteer; and while I myself confess that I have by writing
learned many things which I did not know: if this be so, then this my
labor ought not to seem superfluous to any idle, or to any very learned
reader; while it is needful in no small part, to many who are busy, and
to many who are unlearned,and among these last to myself. Supported,
then, very greatly, and aided by the writings we have already read of
others on this subject, I have undertaken to inquire into and to
discuss, whatever it seems to my judgment can be reverently inquired
into and discussed, concerning the Trinity, the one supreme and
supremely good God; He himself exhorting me to the inquiry, and helping
me in the discussion of it; in order that, if there are no other
writings of the kind, there may be something for those to have and read
who <span id="page_56">p. 56</span> <span
id="iv.i.v.i-Page_56"></span>are willing and capable; but if any exist
already, then it may be so much the easier to find some such writings,
the more there are of the kind in existence.

<span id="iv.i.v.i-p5"></span>2. Assuredly, as in all my writings I
desire not only a pious reader, but also a free corrector, so I
especially desire this in the present inquiry, which is so important
that I would there were as many inquirers as there are objectors. But as
I do not wish my reader to be bound down to me, so I do not wish my
corrector to be bound down to himself. Let not the former love me more
than the catholic faith, let not the latter love himself more than the
catholic verity. As I say to the former, Do not be willing to yield to
my writings as to the canonical Scriptures; but in these, when thou hast
discovered even what thou didst not previously believe, believe it
unhesitatingly; while in those, unless thou hast understood with
certainty what thou didst not before hold as certain, be unwilling to
hold it fast: so I say to the latter, Do not be willing to amend my
writings by thine own opinion or disputation, but from the divine text,
or by unanswerable reason. If thou apprehendest anything of truth in
them, its being there does not make it mine, but by understanding and
loving it, let it be both thine and mine; but if thou convictest
anything of falsehood, though it have once been mine, in that I was
guilty of the error, yet now by avoiding it let it be neither thine nor
mine.

<span id="iv.i.v.i-p6"></span>3. Let this third book, then, take its
beginning at the point to which the second had reached. For after we had
arrived at this, that we desired to show that the Son was not therefore
less than the Father, because the Father sent and the Son was sent; nor
the Holy Spirit therefore less than both, because we read in the Gospel
that He was sent both by the one and by the other; we undertook then to
inquire, since the Son was sent thither, where He already was, for He
came into the world, and “was in the world;” <span
id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) since also the Holy Spirit was sent
thither, where He already was, for “the Spirit of the Lord filleth the
world, and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of the
voice;” <span id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) whether the Lord was
therefore “sent” because He was born in the flesh so as to be no longer
hidden, and, as it were, came forth from the bosom of the Father, and
appeared to the eyes of men in the form of a servant; and the Holy
Spirit also was therefore “sent,” because He too was seen as a dove in a
corporeal form, <span id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) and in cloven
tongues, like as of fire; <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) so
that, to be sent, when spoken of them, means to go forth to the sight of
mortals in some corporeal form from a spiritual hiding-place; which,
because the Father did not, He is said only to have sent, not also to be
sent. Our next inquiry was, Why the Father also is not sometimes said to
be sent, if He Himself was manifested through those corporeal forms
which appeared to the eyes of the ancients. But if the Son was
manifested at these times, why should He be said to be “sent” so long
after, when the fullness of time was come that He should be born of a
woman; <span id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md) since, indeed, He was
sent before also, *viz*., when He appeared corporeally in those forms?
Or if He were not rightly said to be “sent,” except when the Word was
made flesh; <span id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md) why should the Holy
Spirit be read of as “sent,” of whom such an incarnation never took
place? But if neither the Father, nor the Son, but the Holy Spirit was
manifested through these ancient appearances; why should He too be said
to be “sent” now, when He was also sent before in these various manners?
Next we subdivided the subject, that it might be handled most carefully,
and we made the question threefold, of which one part was explained in
the second book, and two remain, which I shall next proceed to discuss.
For we have already inquired and determined, that not only the Father,
nor only the Son, nor only the Holy Spirit appeared in those ancient
corporeal forms and visions, but either indifferently the Lord God, who
is understood to be the Trinity itself, or some one person of the
Trinity, whichever the text of the narrative might signify, through
intimations supplied by the context.

<span id="iv.i.v.i-p4"></span> \[This is an important passage with
reference to Augustin’s learning. From it, it would appear that he had
not read the Greek Trinitarians in the original, and that only “a
little” of these had been translated, at the time when he was composing
this treatise. As this was from <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.v.i-p4.1"></span> A.D.</span> 400 to <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.v.i-p4.2"></span>A.D.</span> 416—, the treatises of Athanasius
(d. 373), Basil (d. 379), Gregory of Nyssa (d. 400?), and Gregory of
Nazianzum (d. 390?) had been composed and were current in the Eastern
church. That Augustin thought out this profound scheme of the doctrine
of the Trinity by the close study of Scripture alone, and unassisted by
the equally profound trinitarianism of the Greek church, is an evidence
of the depth and strength of his remarkable intellect.—W.G.T.S.\]
