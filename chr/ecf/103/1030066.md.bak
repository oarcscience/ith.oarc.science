id="iv.i.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Miracles Which are Done by
Demons are to Be Spurned.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vi.xii-p2"></span>14. For it is easy for the most
worthless spirits to do many things by means of aerial bodies, such as
to cause wonder to souls which are weighed down by earthly bodies, even
though they be of the better inclined. For if earthly bodies themselves,
when trained by a certain skill and practice, exhibit to men so great
marvels in theatrical spectacles, that they who never saw such things
scarcely believe them when told; why should it be hard for the devil and
his angels to make out of corporeal elements, through their own aerial
bodies, things at which the flesh marvels; or even by hidden
inspirations to contrive fantastic appearances to the deluding of men’s
senses, whereby to deceive them, whether awake or asleep, or to drive
them into frenzy? But just as it may happen that one who is better than
they in life and character may gaze at the most worthless of men, either
walking on a rope, or doing by various motions of the body many things
difficult of belief, and yet he may not at all desire to do such things,
nor think those men on that account to be preferred to himself; so the
faithful and pious soul, not only if it sees, but even if on account of
the frailty of the flesh it shudders at, the miracles of demons; yet
will not for that either deplore its own want of power to do such
things, or judge <span id="page_77">p. 77</span> <span
id="iv.i.vi.xii-Page_77"></span>them on this account to be better than
itself; especially since it is in the company of the holy, who, whether
they are men or good angels, accomplish, through the power of God, to
whom all things are subject, wonders which are far greater and the very
reverse of deceptive.
