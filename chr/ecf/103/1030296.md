<span id="iv.ii.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 46.—It is Probable that Children
are Involved in the Guilt Not Only of the First Pair, But of Their Own
Immediate Parents.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xlviii-p2"></span>And it is said, with much appearance
of probability, that infants are involved in the guilt of the sins not
only of the first pair, but of their own immediate parents. For that
divine judgment, “I shall visit the iniquities of the fathers upon the
children,” <span id="fr_1166"></span>[1167](#fn_1166) certainly applies
to them before they come under the new covenant by regeneration. And it
was this new covenant that was prophesied of, when it was said by
Ezekiel, that the sons should not bear the iniquity of the fathers, and
that it should no longer be a proverb in Israel, “The fathers have eaten
sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.” <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167) Here lies the necessity that each
man should be born again, that he might be freed from the sin in which
he was born. For the sins committed afterwards can be cured by
penitence, as we see is the case after baptism. And therefore the new
birth would not have been appointed only that the first birth was
sinful, so sinful that even one who was legitimately born in wedlock
says: “I was shapen in iniquities, <span id="page_253">p. 253</span>
<span id="iv.ii.xlviii-Page_253"></span>and in sins did my mother
conceive me.” <span id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168) He did not say
in *iniquity*, or in *sin*, though he might have said so correctly; but
he preferred to say “iniquities” and “sins,” because in that one sin
which passed upon all men, and which was so great that human nature was
by it made subject to inevitable death, many sins, as I showed above,
may be discriminated; and further, because there are other sins of the
immediate parents, which though they have not the same effect in
producing a change of nature, yet subject the children to guilt unless
the divine grace and mercy interpose to rescue them.
