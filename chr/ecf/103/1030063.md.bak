id="iv.i.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—In What Manner Christ Wills that
All Shall Be One in Himself.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vi.ix-p2"></span>12. So the Son of God Himself, the Word
of God, Himself also the Mediator between God and men, the Son of
man, <span id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) equal to the Father through
the unity of the Godhead, and partaker with us by the taking upon Him of
humanity, interceding for us with the Father in that He was man, <span
id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) yet not concealing that He was God,
one with the Father, among other things speaks thus: “Neither pray I for
these alone,” He says, “but for them also which shall believe on me
through their word; that they all may be one; as <span id="page_76">p.
76</span> <span id="iv.i.vi.ix-Page_76"></span>Thou, Father, art in me,
and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may
believe that Thou hast sent me. And the glory which Thou gavest me I
have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.” <span
