<span id="v.vii.xxxii-p1"></span> 31. For if they be urged from the
Gospel that they should put nothing by for the morrow, they most rightly
answer, “Why then had the Lord Himself a bag in which to put by the
money which was collected? <span id="fr_2571"></span>[2572](#fn_2571.md)
Why so long time beforehand, on occasion of impending famine, were
supplies of corn sent to the holy fathers? <span
id="fr_2572"></span>[2573](#fn_2572.md) Why did Apostles in such wise
provide things necessary for the indigence of saints lest there should
be lack thereafter, that most blessed Paul should thus write to the
Corinthians in his Epistle: “Now concerning the collection for the
saints, as I have given order to the Churches of Galatia, even so do ye.
Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store,
as God hath prospered him, that the gatherings be not then first made
when I come. And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your
letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. And
if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me?” <span
id="fr_2573"></span>[2574](#fn_2573.md) These and much else they most
copiously and most truly bring forward. To whom we answer: Ye see then,
albeit the Lord said, “Take no thought for the morrow,” yet ye are not
by these words constrained to reserve nothing for the morrow: then why
do ye say that by the same words ye are constrained to do nothing? Why
are the birds of the air not a pattern unto you for reserving nothing,
and ye will have them to be a pattern for working nothing?
