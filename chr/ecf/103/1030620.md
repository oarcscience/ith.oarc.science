<span id="v.iv.viii-p1"></span> 7. But whereas the Apostle, when
commending the fruit of unmarried men and women, in that they have
thought of the things of the Lord, how to please God, added and saith,
“But this I say for your profit, not to cast a snare on you,” <span
id="fr_2231"></span>[2232](#fn_2231) that is, not to force you; “but in
order to that which is honorable;” we ought not, because he saith that
the good of the unmarried is honorable, therefore to think that the bond
of marriage is base; otherwise we shall condemn first marriages also,
which neither Cataphryges, nor Novatians, nor their most learned
upholder Tertullian dared to call base. But as, when he says, “But I say
unto the unmarried and widows, that it is good for them if they shall
have so continued;” <span id="fr_2232"></span>[2233](#fn_2232) assuredly
he set down “good” for “better,” since every thing, which, when compared
with a good, is called better, this also without doubt is a good; for
what else is it that it is so called better, save that it is more good?
and yet we do not on this account suppose him by consequence to have
thought that it was an evil, in case they married, in that he said, “it
is good for them, if they shall have so continued;” so also, when he
says, “but in order to that which is honest,” he hath not shown that
marriage is base, but that which was honester than (another thing also)
honest, he hath commended by the name of honest in general. Because what
is honester, save what is more honest? But what is more honest is
certainly honest. Forsooth he plainly showed that this is better than
that other that is good, where he says, “Whoso giveth to marry, doeth
well; but whoso giveth not to marry, doeth better.” <span
id="fr_2233"></span>[2234](#fn_2233) And this more blessed than that
other that is blessed, where he saith, “But she shall be more blessed,
if she shall have so continued.” <span
id="fr_2234"></span>[2235](#fn_2234) As, therefore, there is than good a
better, and than blessed a more blessed, so is there than honest an
honester, which he chose to call honest. For far be it that that be
base, of which the Apostle Peter speaking saith, “Husbands, unto your
wives, as unto the weaker and subject vessel, give honor, as unto
co-heirs of grace;” and addressing the wives, he exhorts them, by the
pattern of Sarah, to be subject unto their husbands; “For so,” saith he,
“certain holy women, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, obeying their
own husbands; even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose
daughters ye are made, well-doing, and not fearing any
disturbance.” <span id="fr_2235"></span>[2236](#fn_2235)
