<span id="iv.ii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—Faith Itself is the Gift of
God; And Good Works Will Not Be Wanting in Those Who Believe.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxxiii-p2"></span>And lest men should arrogate to
themselves the merit of their own faith at least, not understanding that
this too is the gift of God, this same apostle, who says in another
place that he had “obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful,” <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128.md) here also adds: “and that not <span
id="page_248">p. 248</span> <span id="iv.ii.xxxiii-Page_248"></span>of
yourselves; it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should
boast.” <span id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129.md) And lest it should be
thought that good works will be wanting in those who believe, he adds
further: “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in
them.” <span id="fr_1130"></span>[1131](#fn_1130.md) We shall be made truly
free, then, when God fashions us, that is, forms and creates us anew,
not as men—for He has done that already—but as good men, which His grace
is now doing, that we may be a new creation in Christ Jesus, according
as it is said: “Create in me a clean heart, O God.” <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131.md) For God had already created his
heart, so far as the physical structure of the human heart is concerned;
but the psalmist prays for the renewal of the life which was still
lingering in his heart.
