id="iv.i.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—The Old Philosophers are Not
to Be Consulted Concerning the Resurrection and Concerning Things to
Come.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vi.xvii-p2"></span>21. These people also blame us for
believing the resurrection of the flesh, and rather wish us to believe
themselves concerning these things. As though, because they have been
able to understand the high and unchangeable substance by the things
which are made, <span id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523.md) for this reason
they had a claim to be consulted concerning the revolutions of mutable
things, or concerning the connected order of the ages. For pray, because
they dispute most truly, and persuade us by most certain proofs, that
all things temporal are made after a science that is eternal, are they
therefore able to see clearly in the matter of this science itself, or
to collect from it, how many kinds of animals there are, what are the
seeds of each in their beginnings, what measure in their increase, what
numbers run through their conceptions, births, ages, settings; what
motions in desiring things according to their nature, and in avoiding
the contrary? Have they not sought out all these things, not through
that unchangeable wisdom, but through the actual history of places and
times, or have trusted the written experience of others? Wherefore it is
the less to be wondered at, that they have utterly failed in searching
out the succession of more lengthened ages, and in finding any goal of
that course, down which, as though down a river, the human race is
sailing, and the transition thence of each to its own appropriate end.
For these are subjects which historians could not describe, inasmuch as
they are far in the future, and have been experienced and related by no
one. Nor have those philosophers, who have profiled better than others
in that high and eternal science, been able to grasp such subjects with
the understanding; otherwise they would not be inquiring as they could
into past things of the kind, such as are in the province of historians,
but rather would foreknow also things future; and those who are able to
do this are called by them soothsayers, but by us prophets:
