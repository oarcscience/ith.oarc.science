<span id="iv.ii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—It is Not Essential to Man’s
Happiness that He Should Know the Causes of Physical Convulsions; But It
Is, that He Should Know the Causes of Good and Evil.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xviii-p2"></span>Now, in view of these considerations,
when we are pleased with that line of Maro, “Happy the man who has
attained to the knowledge of the causes of things,” <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108.md) we should not suppose that it is
necessary to happiness to know the causes of the great physical
convulsions, causes which lie hid in the most secret recesses of
nature’s kingdom, “whence comes the earthquake whose force makes the
deep seas to swell and burst their barriers, and again to return upon
themselves and settle down.” <span id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109.md)
But we ought to know the causes of good and evil as far as man may in
this life know them, in order to avoid the mistakes and troubles of
which this life is so full. For our aim must always be to reach that
state of happiness in which no trouble shall distress us, and no error
mislead us. If we must know the causes of physical convulsions, there
are none which it concerns us more to know than those which affect our
own health. But seeing that, in our ignorance of these, we are fain to
resort to physicians, it would seem that we might bear with considerable
patience our ignorance of the secrets that lie hid in the earth and
heavens.
