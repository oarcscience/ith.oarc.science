<span id="v.iii.l-p1"></span> 49. Wherefore also the virgins of God
without blame indeed, “follow the Lamb whithersoever He shall have
gone,” both the cleansing of sins being perfected, and virginity being
kept, which, were it lost, could not return: but, because that same
Apocalypse itself, wherein such unto one such were revealed, in this
also praises them, that “in their mouth there was not found a
lie:” <span id="fr_2204"></span>[2205](#fn_2204) let them remember in
this also to be true, that they dare not say that they have not sin.
Forsooth the same John, who saw that, hath said this, “If we shall have
said that we have not sin, we deceive our own selves, and the truth is
not in us; but if we shall have confessed our faults, He is faithful and
just, <span id="page_436">p. 436</span> <span
id="v.iii.l-Page_436"></span>so as to forgive us our sins, and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness. But if we shall have said that we
have not sinned, we shall make Him a liar, and His word shall not be in
us.” <span id="fr_2205"></span>[2206](#fn_2205) This surely is not said
unto these or those, but unto all Christians, wherein virgins also ought
to recognize themselves. For thus they shall be without a lie, such as
in the Apocalypse they appeared. And by this means so long as there is
not as yet perfection in heavenly height, confession in lowliness maketh
them without blame.
