<span id="v.iii.xxxii-p1"></span> 31. Whence the greatness of this
service, <span id="fr_2100"></span>[2101](#fn_2100.md) unto the undertaking
of which we have according to our strength exhorted, the more excellent
and divine it is, the more doth it warn our anxiety, to say something
not only concerning most glorious chastity, but also concerning safest
humility. When then such as make profession of perpetual chastity,
comparing themselves with married persons, shall have discovered, that,
according to the Scriptures, the others are below both in work and
wages, both in vow and reward, let what is written straightway come into
their mind, “By how much thou art great, by so much humble thyself in
all things: and thou shalt find favor before God.” <span
id="fr_2101"></span>[2102](#fn_2101.md) The measure of humility for each
hath been given from the measure of his greatness itself: unto which
pride is full of danger, which layeth the greater wait against persons
the greater they be. On this followeth envying, as a daughter in her
train; forsooth pride straight<span id="page_428">p. 428</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxxii-Page_428"></span>way giveth birth to her, nor is she
ever without such a daughter and companion. By which two evils, that is,
pride and envying, is the devil (a devil). Therefore it is against
pride, the mother of envying, that the whole Christian discipline
chiefly wars. For this teaches humility, whereby both to gain and to
keep charity; of which after that it had been said, “Charity envieth
not;” <span id="fr_2102"></span>[2103](#fn_2102.md) as though we were
asking the reason, how it comes to pass that it envieth not, he
straightway added, “is not puffed up;” as though he should say, on this
account it hath not envying, in that neither hath it pride. Therefore
the Teacher of humility, Christ, first “emptied Himself, taking the form
of a servant, made in the likeness of men, and found in fashion as a
man, He humbled Himself, made obedient even unto death, even the death
of the Cross.” <span id="fr_2103"></span>[2104](#fn_2103.md) But His
teaching itself, how carefully it suggests humility, and how earnest and
instant it is in commanding this, who can easily unfold, and bring
together all witnesses for proof of this matter? This let him essay to
do, or do, whosoever shall wish to write a separate treatise on
humility; but of this present work the end proposed is different, and it
hath been undertaken on a matter so great, as that it hath chiefly to
guard against pride.
