is it that the Martyrs, by the very benefits which are given to them
that pray, indicate that they take an interest in the affairs of men, if
the dead know not what the quick are doing. For not only by effects of
benefits, but in the very beholding of men, it is certain, <span

denizenship among you thou piously lovest) appeared when the barbarians
were attacking Nola, as we have heard not by uncertain rumors, but by
sure witnesses. But such things are of God exhibited, far otherwise than
as the usual order hath itself, unto each kind of creatures apportioned.
For it does not follow because water was, when it pleased the Lord, in a
moment changed into wine, that we are not to regard the worth and
efficacy of water in <span id="page_549">p. 549</span> <span
id="v.ix.xx-Page_549"></span>the proper order of the elements, as
distinct from the rarity, or rather singularity, of that divine work:
nor because Lazarus rose again, therefore that every dead man rises when
he will; or that a lifeless man is raised up by a living, in the same
way as a sleeping man by one who is awake. Other be the limits of human
things, other the signs of divine virtues: other they be that are
naturally, other that be miraculously done: albeit both unto nature God
is present that it may be, and unto miracles nature is not lacking. We
are not to think then, that to be interested in the affairs of the
living is in the power of any departed who please, only because to some
men’s healing or help the Martyrs be present: but rather we are to
understand that it must needs be by a Divine power that the Martyrs are
interested in affairs of the living, from the very fact that for the
departed to be by their proper nature interested in affairs of the
living is impossible.
