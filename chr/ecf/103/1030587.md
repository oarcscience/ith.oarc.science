<span id="v.iii.xxxiv-p1"></span> 33. Whereas, then, all Christians have
to guard humility, forasmuch as it is from Christ that they are called
Christians, Whose Gospel no one considers with care, but that he
discovers Him to be a Teacher of humility; specially is it becoming that
they be followers and keepers of this virtue, who excel the rest of men
in any great good, in order that they may have a great care of that,
which I set down in the beginning, “By how much thou art great, by so
much humble thyself in all things, and thou shall find grace before
God.” <span id="fr_2115"></span>[2116](#fn_2115.md) Wherefore, because
perpetual Continence and specially virginity, is a great good in the
Saints of God, they must with all watchfulness beware, that it be not
corrupted with pride.
