<span id="iv.i.xvi.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—How Any One Can Forget and
Remember God.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xiii-p2"></span>17. Let us take an instance for the
purpose from visible things. Somebody whom you do not recognize, says to
you, You know me; and in order to remind you, tells you where, when, and
how he became known to you; and if, after the mention of every sign by
which you might be recalled to remembrance, you still do not recognize
him, then you have so come to forget, as that the whole of that
knowledge is altogether blotted out of your mind; and nothing else
remains, but that you take his word for it who tells you that you once
knew him; or do not even do that, if you do not think the person who
speaks to you to be worthy of credit. But if you do remember him, then
no doubt you return to your own memory, and find in it that which had
not been altogether blotted out by forgetfulness. Let us return to that
which led us to adduce this instance from the intercourse of men. Among
other things, the 9th Psalm says, “The wicked shall be turned into hell,
and all the nations. that forget God;” <span
id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886) and again the 22d Psalm, “All the ends
of the world shall be reminded, and turned unto the Lord.” <span
id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887) These nations, then, will not so have
forgotten God as to be unable to remember Him when reminded of Him; yet,
by forgetting God, as though forgetting their own life, they had been
turned into death, *i.e.* into hell. <span
id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888) But when reminded they are turned to
the Lord, as though coming to life again by remembering their proper
life which they had forgotten. It is read also in the 94th Psalm,
“Perceive now, ye who are unwise among the people; and ye fools, when
will ye be wise? He that planted the ear, shall He not hear?” etc. <span
id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889) For this is spoken to those, who said
vain things concerning God through not understanding Him.
