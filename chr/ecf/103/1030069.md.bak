id="iv.i.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Christ the Most Perfect Victim
for Cleansing Our Faults. In Every Sacrifice Four Things are to Be
Considered.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vi.xv-p2"></span>19. They do not understand, that not
even the proudest of spirits themselves could rejoice in the honor of
sacrifices, unless a true sacrifice was due to the one true God, in
whose stead they desire to be worshipped: and that this cannot be
rightly offered except by a holy and righteous priest; nor unless that
which is offered be received from those for whom it is offered; and
unless also it be without fault, so that it may be offered for cleansing
the faulty. This at least all desire who wish sacrifice to be offered
for themselves to God. Who then is so righteous and holy a priest as the
only Son of God, who had no need to purge His own sins by
sacrifice, <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md) neither original
sins, nor those which are added by human life? And what could be so
fitly chosen by men to be offered for them as human flesh? And what so
fit for this immolation as mortal flesh? And what so clean for cleansing
the faults of mortal men as the flesh born in and from the womb of a
virgin, without any infection of carnal concupiscence? And what could be
so acceptably offered and taken, as the flesh of our sacrifice, made the
body of our priest? In such wise that, whereas four things are to be
considered in every sacrifice,—to whom it is offered, by whom it is
offered, what is offered, for whom it is offered,—the same One and true
Mediator Himself, reconciling us to God by the sacrifice of peace, might
remain one with Him to whom He offered, might make those one in Himself
for whom He offered, Himself might be in one both the offerer and the
offering.
