<span id="iv.i.iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—In What Manner the Son is Said
Not to Know the Day and the Hour Which the Father Knows. Some Things
Said of Christ According to the Form of God, Other Things According to
the Form of a Servant. In What Way It is of Christ to Give the Kingdom,
in What Not of Christ. Christ Will Both Judge and Not Judge.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iii.xii-p2"></span>Again, “Of that day and that hour
knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven; neither the Son,
but the Father.” <span id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) For He is
ignorant of this, as *making others ignorant*; that is, in that He did
not so know as at that time to show His disciples: <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) as it was said to Abraham, “Now I know
that thou fearest God,” <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) that is,
now I have caused thee to know it; because he himself, being tried in
that temptation, became known to himself. For He was certainly going to
tell this same thing to His disciples at the fitting time; speaking of
which yet future as if past, He says, “Henceforth I call you not
servants, but friends; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth:
but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my
Father I have made known unto you;” <span
id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) which He had not yet done, but spoke
as though He had already done it, because He certainly would do it. For
He says to the disciples themselves, “I have yet many things to say unto
you; but ye cannot bear them now.” <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) Among which is to be understood also,
“Of the day and hour.” For the apostle also says, “I determined not to
know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified;” <span
id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) because he was speaking to those who
were not able to receive higher things concerning the Godhead of Christ.
To whom also a little while after he says, “I could not speak unto you
as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.” <span
id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) He was “ignorant,” therefore, among
them of that which they were not able to know from him. And that only he
said that he knew, which it was fitting that they should know from him.
In short, he knew among the perfect what he knew not among babes; for he
there says: “We speak wisdom among them that are perfect.” <span
id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) For a man is said <span
id="page_31">p. 31</span> <span id="iv.i.iii.xii-Page_31"></span>not to
know what he hides, after that kind of speech, after which a ditch is
called blind which is hidden. For the Scriptures do not use any other
kind of speech than may be found in use among men, because they speak to
men.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xii-p11"></span>24. According to the form of God, it
is said “Before all the hills He begat me,” <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) that is, before all the loftinesses of
things created and, “Before the dawn I begat Thee,” <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) that is, before all times and temporal
things: but according to the form of a servant, it is said, “The Lord
created me in the beginning of His ways.” <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) Because, according to the form of God,
He said, “I am the truth;” and according to the form of a servant, “I am
the way.” <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) For, because He
Himself, being the first-begotten of the dead, <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) made a passage to the kingdom of God
to life eternal for His Church, to which He is so the Head as to make
the body also immortal, therefore He was “created in the beginning of
the ways” of God in His work. For, according to the form of God, He is
the beginning, <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) that also
speaketh unto us, in which “beginning” God created the heaven and the
earth; <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) but according to the form
of a servant, “He is a bridegroom coming out of His chamber.” <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) According to the form of God, “He is
the first-born of every creature, and He is before all things and by him
all things consist;” according to the form of a servant, “He is the head
of the body, the Church.” <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md)
According to the form of God, “He is the Lord of glory.” <span
id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) From which it is evident that He
Himself glorifies His saints: for, “Whom He did predestinate, them He
also called; and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He
justified, them He also glorified.” <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) Of Him accordingly it is said, that He
justifieth the ungodly; <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) of Him
it is said, that He is just and a justifier. <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) If, therefore, He has also glorified
those whom He has justified, He who justifies, Himself also glorifies;
who is, as I have said, the Lord of glory. Yet, according to the form of
a servant, He replied to His disciples, when inquiring about their own
glorification: “To sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to
give, but \[it shall be given to them\] for whom it is prepared by my
Father.” <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.xii-p26"></span>25. But that which is prepared by His
Father is prepared also by the Son Himself, because He and the Father
are one. <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) For we have already
shown, by many modes of speech in the divine Scriptures, that, in this
Trinity, what is said of each is also said of all, on account of the
indivisible working of the one and same substance. As He also says of
the Holy Spirit, “If I depart, I will send Him unto you.” <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) He did not say, *We* will send; but in
such way as if the Son only should send Him, and not the Father; while
yet He says in another place, “These things have I spoken unto you,
being yet present with you; but the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,
whom the Father will send in my name, He shall teach you all
things.” <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) Here again it is so
said as if the Son also would not send Him, but the Father only. As
therefore in these texts, so also where He says, “But for them for whom
it is prepared by my Father,” He meant it to be understood that He
Himself, with the Father, prepares seats of glory for those for whom He
will. But some one may say: There, when He spoke of the Holy Spirit, He
so says that He Himself will send Him, as not to deny that the Father
will send Him; and in the other place, He so says that the Father will
send Him, as not to deny that He will do so Himself; but here He
expressly says, “It is not mine to give,” and so goes on to say that
these things are prepared by the Father. But this is the very thing
which we have already laid down to be said according to the form of a
servant: *viz.*, that we are so to understand “It is not mine to give,”
as if it were said, This is not in the power of man to give; that so He
may be understood to give it through that wherein He is God equal to the
Father. “It is not mine,” He says, “to give;” that is, I do not give
these things by human power, but “to those for whom it is prepared by my
Father;” but then take care you understand also, that if “all things
which the Father hath are mine,” <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md)
then this certainly is mine also, and I with the Father have prepared
these things.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xii-p31"></span>26. For I ask again, in what manner
this is said, “If any man hear not my words, I will not judge
him?” <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) For perhaps He has said
here, “I will not judge him,” in the same sense as there, “It is not
mine to give.” But what follows here? “I came not,” He says, “to judge
the world, but to save the world;” and then He adds, “He that rejecteth
me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him.” Now here we
should understand the Father, unless He had added, “The word that I have
spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.” Well, then, will
neither the Son judge, because He says, “I will not judge him,” nor the
Father, but the word which the Son hath spoken? Nay, <span
id="page_32">p. 32</span> <span id="iv.i.iii.xii-Page_32"></span>but
hear what yet follows: “For I,” He says, “have not spoken of myself; but
the Father which sent me, He gave me a commandment, what I should say,
and what I should speak; and I know that His commandment is life
everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto
me, so I speak.” If therefore the Son judges not, but “the word which
the Son hath spoken;” and the word which the Son hath spoken therefore
judges, because the Son “hath not spoken of Himself, but the Father who
sent Him gave Him a commandment what He should say, and what He should
speak:” then the Father assuredly judges, whose word it is which the Son
hath spoken; and the same Son Himself is the very Word of the Father.
For the commandment of the Father is not one thing, and the word of the
Father another; for He hath called it both a word and a commandment. Let
us see, therefore, whether perchance, when He says, “I have not spoken
of myself,” He meant to be understood thus,—I am not born of myself. For
if He speaks the word of the Father, then He speaks Himself, <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) because He is Himself the Word of the
Father. For ordinarily He says, “The Father gave to me;” by which He
means it to be understood that the Father begat Him: not that He gave
anything to Him, already existing and not possessing it; but that the
very meaning of, To have given that He might have, is, To have begotten
that He might be. For it is not, as with the creature so with the Son of
God before the incarnation and before He took upon Him our flesh, the
Only-begotten by whom all things were made; that He *is* one thing, and
has another: but He *is* in such way as to *be* what He *has*. And this
is said more plainly, if any one is fit to receive it, in that place
where He says: “For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given
to the Son to have life in Himself.” <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) For He did not give to Him, already
existing and not having life, that He should have life in Himself;
inasmuch as, in that He *is*, He is life. Therefore “He gave to the Son
to have life in Himself” means, He begat the Son to be unchangeable
life, which is life eternal. Since, therefore, the Word of God is the
Son of God, and the Son of God is “the true God and eternal life,” <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) as John says in his Epistle; so here,
what else are we to acknowledge when the Lord says, “The word which I
have spoken, the same shall judge him at the last day,” <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) and calls that very word the word of
the Father and the commandment of the Father, and that very commandment
everlasting life?” “And I know,” He says, “that His commandment is life
everlasting.”

<span id="iv.i.iii.xii-p37"></span>27. I ask, therefore, how we are to
understand, “I will not judge him; but the Word which I have spoken
shall judge him:” which appears from what follows to be so said, as if
He would say, I will not judge; but the Word of the Father will judge.
But the Word of the Father is the Son of God Himself. Is it to be so
understood: I will not judge, but I will judge? How can this be true,
unless in this way: *viz*., I will not judge by human power, because I
am the Son of man; but I will judge by the power of the Word, because I
am the Son of God? Or if it still seems contradictory and inconsistent
to say, I will not judge, but I will judge; what shall we say of that
place where He says, “My doctrine is not mine?” How “mine,” when “not
mine?” For He did not say, *This* doctrine is not mine, but “*My*
doctrine is not mine:” that which He called His own, the same He called
not His own. How can this be true, unless He has called it His own in
one relation; not His own, in another? According to the form of God, His
own; according to the form of a servant, not His own. For when He says,
“It is not mine, but His that sent me,” <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) He makes us recur to the Word itself.
For the doctrine of the Father is the Word of the Father, which is the
Only Son. And what, too, does that mean, “He that believeth on me,
believeth not on me?” <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) How
believe on Him, yet not believe on Him? How can so opposite and
inconsistent a thing be understood—“Whoso believeth on me,” He says,
“believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me;”—unless you so understand
it, Whoso believeth on me believeth not on that which he sees, lest our
hope should be in the creature; but on Him who took the creature,
whereby He might appear to human eyes, and so might cleanse our hearts
by faith, to contemplate Himself as equal to the Father? So that in
turning the attention of believers to the Father, and saying, “Believeth
not on me, but on Him that sent me,” He certainly did not mean Himself
to be separated from the Father, that is, from Him that sent Him; but
that men might so believe on Himself, as they believe on the Father, to
whom He is equal. And this He says in express terms in another place,
“Ye believe in God, believe also in me:” <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) that is, in the same way as you
believe in God, so also believe in me; because I and the Father are One
God. As therefore, here, He has as it were withdrawn <span
id="page_33">p. 33</span> <span id="iv.i.iii.xii-Page_33"></span>the
faith of men from Himself, and transferred it to the Father, by saying,
“Believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me,” from whom nevertheless
He certainly did not separate Himself; so also, when He says, “It is not
mine to give, but \[it shall be given to them\] for whom it is prepared
by my Father,” it is I think plain in what relation both are to be
taken. For that other also is of the same kind, “I will not judge;”
whereas He Himself shall judge the quick and dead. <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) But because He will not do so by human
power, therefore, reverting to the Godhead, He raises the hearts of men
upwards; which to lift up, He Himself came down.
