<span id="v.ii.xvi-p1"></span> 15. For what Christian men of our time
being free from the marriage bond, having power to contain from all
sexual intercourse, seeing it to be now “a time,” as it is written, “not
of embracing, but of abstaining from embrace,” <span
id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976) would not choose rather to keep
virginal or widowed continence, than (now that there is no obligation
from duty to human society) to endure tribulation of the flesh, without
which marriages cannot be (to pass over in silence other things from
which the Apostle spares.) But when through desire reigning they shall
have been joined together, if they shall after overcome it, because it
is not lawful to loose, in such wise as it was lawful not to tie, the
marriage bond, they be<span id="page_406">p. 406</span> <span
id="v.ii.xvi-Page_406"></span>come such as the form of marriage makes
profession of, so as that either by mutual consent they ascend unto a
higher degree of holiness, or, if both are not such, the one who is such
will not be one to exact but to yield the due, observing in all things a
chaste and religious concord. But in those times, wherein as yet the
mystery of our salvation was veiled in prophetic sacraments, even they
who were such before marriage, yet contracted marriage through the duty
of begetting children, not overcome by lust, but led by piety, unto whom
if there were given such choice as in the revelation of the New
Testament there hath been given, the Lord saying “Whoso can receive, let
him receive;” <span id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977) no one doubts
that they would have been ready to receive it even with joy, who reads
with careful attention what use they made of their wives, at a time when
also it was allowed one man to have several, whom he had with more
chastity, than any now has his one wife, of these, unto whom we see what
the Apostle allows by way of leave. <span
id="fr_1978"></span>[1979](#fn_1978) For they had them in the work of
begetting children, not “in the disease of desire, as the nations which
know not God.” <span id="fr_1979"></span>[1980](#fn_1979) And this is so
great a thing, that many at this day more easily abstain from all sexual
intercourse their whole life through, than, if they are joined in
marriage, observe the measure of not coming together except for the sake
of children. Forsooth we have many brethren and partners in the heavenly
inheritance of both sexes that are continent, whether they be such as
have made trial of marriage, or such as are entirely free from all such
intercourse: forsooth they are without number: yet, in our familiar
discourses with them, whom have we heard, whether of those who are, or
of those who have been, married, declaring to us that he has never had
sexual intercourse with his wife, save with the hope of conception?
What, therefore, the Apostles command the married, this is proper to
marriage, but what they allow by way of pardon, or what hinders prayers,
this marriage compels not, but bears with.
