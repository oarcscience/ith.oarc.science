<span id="v.v.xxxi-p1"></span> 30. Moreover, it was said to the Apostles
that they should take nothing with them for their journey, but should
live by the Gospel. <span id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md) And in a
certain place too the Lord Himself signified why He said this, when He
added, “The laborer is worthy of his hire:” <span
id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347.md) where He sufficiently shows that
this is permitted, not ordered; lest haply he who should do this,
namely, that in this work of preaching the word he should take aught for
the uses of this life from them to whom he preached, should think he was
doing any thing unlawful. And yet that it may more laudably not be done
is sufficiently proved in the Apostle Paul: who, while he said, “Let him
that is taught in the word, communicate unto him, that teacheth in all
things,” <span id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348.md) and showed in many
places that this is wholesomely done by them to whom he preached the
word, “Nevertheless,” saith he, “I have not used this power.” <span
id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349.md) The Lord, therefore, when He spake
those words, gave power, not bound men by a command. So in general, what
in words we are not able to understand, in the actions of the Saints we
gather how it is meet to be taken, which would easily be drawn to the
other side, unless it were recalled by an example.
