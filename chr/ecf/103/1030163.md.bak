<span id="iv.i.xiv.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xiv.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—Of What Kind are the Outer and
the Inner Man.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xiv.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.xiv.i-p2.1"></span>Come</span> now, and let us see where lies,
as it were, the boundary line between the outer and inner man. For
whatever we have in the mind common with the beasts, thus much is
rightly said to belong to the outer man. For the outer man is not to be
considered to be the body only, but with the addition also of a certain
peculiar life of the body, whence the structure of the body derives its
vigor, and all the senses with which he is equipped for the perception
of outward things; and when the images of these outward things already
perceived, that have been fixed in the memory, are seen again by
recollection, it is still a matter pertaining to the outer man. And in
all these things we do not differ from the beasts, except that in shape
of body we are not prone, but upright. And we are admonished through
this, by Him who made us, not to be like the beasts in that which is our
better part—that is, the mind—while we differ from them by the
uprightness of the body. Not that we are to throw our mind into those
bodily things which are exalted; for to seek rest for the will, even in
such things, is to prostrate the mind. But as the body is naturally
raised upright to those bodily things which are most elevated, that is,
to things celestial; so the mind, which is a spiritual substance, must
be raised upright to those things which are most elevated in spiritual
things, not by the elation of pride, but by the dutifulness of
righteousness.
