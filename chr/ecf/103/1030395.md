<span id="iv.iii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—Of the Babylonish Captivity,
and the Things Signified Thereby.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxii-p2"></span>37. “Howbeit, after the lapse of some
generations, another type was presented, which bears very emphatically
on the matter in hand. For that city <span
id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) was brought into captivity, and a
large section of the people were carried off into Babylonia. Now, as
Jerusalem signifies the city and fellowship of the saints, so Babylonia
signifies the city and fellowship of the wicked, seeing that by
interpretation it denotes *confusion*. On the sub<span id="page_306">p.
306</span> <span id="iv.iii.xxii-Page_306"></span>ject of these two
cities, which have been running their courses, mingling the one with the
other, through all the changes of time from the beginning of the human
race, and which shall so move on together until the end of the world,
when they are destined to be separated at the last judgment, we have
spoken already a little ago. <span id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md)
That captivity, then, of the city of Jerusalem, and the people thus
carried into Babylonia in bondage, were ordained so to proceed by the
Lord, by the voice of Jeremiah, a prophet of that time. <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md) And there appeared kings <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) of Babylon, under whom they were in
slavery, who on occasion of the captivity of this people were so wrought
upon by certain miracles that they came to know the one true God who
founded universal creation, and worshipped Him, and commanded that He
should be worshipped. Moreover the people were ordered both to pray for
those by whom they were detained in captivity, and in their peace to
hope for peace, to the effect that they should beget children, and build
houses, and plant gardens and vineyards. <span
id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454.md) But at the end of seventy years,
release from their captivity was promised to them. <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md) All this, furthermore, signified in
a figure that the Church of Christ in all His saints, who are citizens
of the heavenly Jerusalem, would have to do service under the kings of
this world. For the doctrine of the apostles speaks also in this wise,
that ‘every soul should be subject to the higher powers,’ and that there
‘should be rendered all things to all men, tribute to whom tribute (is
due), custom to whom custom,’ <span id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456.md)
and all other things in like manner which, without detriment to the
worship of our God, we render to the rulers in the constitution of human
society: for the Lord Himself also, in order to set before us an example
of this sound doctrine, did not deem it unworthy of Him to pay
tribute <span id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457.md) on account of that
human individuality <span id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458.md) wherewith
He was invested. Again, Christian servants and good believers are also
commanded to serve their temporal masters in equanimity and
faithfulness; <span id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459.md) whom they will
hereafter judge, if even on to the end they find them wicked, or with
whom they will hereafter reign in equality, if they too shall have been
converted to the true God. Still all are enjoined to be subject to the
powers that are of man and of earth, even until, at the end of the
predetermined time which the seventy years signify, the Church shall be
delivered from the confusion of this world, like as Jerusalem was to be
set free from the captivity in Babylonia. By occasion of that captivity,
however, the kings of earth too have themselves been led to forsake the
idols on account of which they were wont to persecute the Christians,
and have come to know, and now worship, the one true God and Christ the
Lord; and it is on their behalf that the Apostle Paul enjoins prayer to
be made, even although they should persecute the Church. For he speaks
in these terms: ‘I entreat, therefore, that first of all supplications,
adorations, <span id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460.md) intercessions,
and givings of thanks be made for kings, for all men, and all that are
in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, with all
godliness and charity.’ <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md)
Accordingly peace has been given to the Church by these same persons,
although it be but of a temporal sort,—a temporal quiet for the work of
building houses after a spiritual fashion, and planting gardens and
vineyards. For witness your own case, too,—at this very time we are
engaged, by means of this discourse, in building you up and planting
you. And the like process is going on throughout the whole circle of
lands, in virtue of the peace allowed by Christian kings, even as the
same apostle thus expresses himself: ‘Ye are God’s husbandry; ye are
God’s building.’ <span id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md)

<span id="iv.iii.xxii-p16"></span>38. “And, indeed, after the lapse of
the seventy years of which Jeremiah had mystically prophesied, to the
intent of prefiguring the end of times, with a view still to the
perfecting of that same figure, no settled peace and liberty were
conceded again to the Jews. Thus it was that they were conquered
subsequently by the Romans and made tributary. From that period, in
truth, at which they received the land of promise and began to have
kings, in order to preclude the supposition that the promise of the
Christ who was to be their Liberator had met its complete fulfillment in
the person of any one of their kings, Christ was prophesied of with
greater clearness in a number of prophecies; not only by David himself
in the book of Psalms, but also by the rest of the great and holy
prophets, even on to the time of their conveyance into captivity in
Babylonia; and in that same captivity there were also prophets whose
mission was to prophesy of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ as the
Liberator of all. And after the restoration of the temple, when the
seventy years had passed, the Jews sus<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>
<span id="iv.iii.xxii-Page_307"></span>tained grievous oppressions and
sufferings at the hands of the kings of the Gentiles, fitted to make
them understand that the Liberator was not yet come, whom they failed to
apprehend as one who was to effect for them a spiritual deliverance, and
whom they fondly longed for on account of a carnal liberation.
