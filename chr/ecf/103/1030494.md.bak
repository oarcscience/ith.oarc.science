<span id="v.i.xi-p1"></span> 11. But some one will say to me that it is
one thing to live after man, another thing to live after the flesh;
because man forsooth is a rational creature, and there is in him a
rational soul, whereby he differs from the beast: but the flesh is the
lowest and earthly part of man, and thus to live after it is faulty: and
for this reason, he who lives after man, assuredly lives not after the
flesh, but rather after that part of man, whereby he is man, that is,
after the spirit of the mind whereby he excels the beasts. But this
discussion is perhaps of some force in the schools of philosophers: but
we, in order to understand the Apostle of Christ, ought to observe in
what manner the Christian books are used to speak; at any rate it is the
belief of all of us, to whom to live is Christ, that Man was taken unto
Himself by the Word of God, not surely without a rational soul, as
certain heretics will have it; and yet we read, “The Word was made
flesh.” <span id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838.md) What is to be here
understood by “flesh,” but Man? “And all flesh shall see the salvation
of God.” <span id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839.md) What can be
understood, but all men? “Unto Thee shall all flesh come.” <span
id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840.md) What is it, but all men? “Thou hast
given unto Him power over all flesh.” <span
id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841.md) What is it, but all men? “Of the
works of the Law shall no flesh be justified.” <span
id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842.md) What is it, but no man shall be
justified? And this the same Apostle in another place confessing more
plainly saith, “Man shall not be justified of the works of the
Law.” <span id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843.md) The Corinthians also he
rebukes, saying, “Are ye not carnal, and walk after man?” <span
id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844.md) After he had called them carnal, he
saith not, ye walk after the flesh, but after man, forasmuch as by this
also what would he have understood, but after the flesh? For surely if
to walk, that is, to live, after the flesh deserved blame, but after man
deserved praise, he would not say by way of rebuke, “ye walk after man.”
Let man recognize the reproach; let him change his purpose, let him shun
destruction. Hear thou man: walk not thou after man, but after Him Who
made man. Fall not thou away from Him Who made thee, even unto thyself.
For a man said, who yet lived not after man, “Not that we are sufficient
to think any thing from ourselves, as though of ourselves: but our
sufficiency is of God.” <span id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845.md)
Consider if he lived after man, who spake these things with truth.
Therefore the Apostle, admonishing man not to live after man, restores
man to God. But whoso liveth not after man, but after God, assuredly
liveth not even after himself, because himself also is a man. But he is
therefore said also to live after the flesh, when he so lives; because
also when the flesh alone hath been named, man is understood, as we have
already shown: just as when the soul alone hath been named, man is
understood: whence it is said, “Let every soul be subject unto the
higher powers,” <span id="fr_1846"></span>[1847](#fn_1846.md) that is,
every man; and, “Seventy-five souls went down into Egypt with
Jacob,” <span id="fr_1847"></span>[1848](#fn_1847.md) that is, seventy-five
men. Therefore live thou not after thyself, O man: thou hadst thence
perished, but thou wast sought. Live not then, I say, after thyself, O
man; thou hadst thence perished, but thou wast found. Accuse not thou
the nature of the flesh, when you hear it said, “If ye shall live after
the flesh, ye shall die.” <span id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848.md) For
thus <span id="page_384">p. 384</span> <span
id="v.i.xi-Page_384"></span>could it be said, and most truly could it,
If ye shall live after yourselves ye shall die. For the devil hath not
flesh, and yet, because he would live after himself, “he abode not in
the truth.” <span id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849.md) What wonder
therefore, if, living after himself, “when he speaketh a lie, he
speaketh of his own,” which the Truth spake truly of him.
