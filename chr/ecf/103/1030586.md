<span id="v.iii.xxxiii-p1"></span> 32. Wherefore a few witnesses, which
the Lord deigns to suggest to my mind, I proceed to mention, from out
the teaching of Christ concerning humility, such as perhaps may be
enough for my purpose. His discourse, the first which He delivered to
His disciples at greater length, began from this. “Blessed are the poor
in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.” <span
id="fr_2104"></span>[2105](#fn_2104) And these without all controversy
we take to be humble. The faith of that Centurion He on this account
chiefly praised, and said that He had not found in Israel so great
faith, because he believed with so great humility as to say, “I am not
worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.” <span
id="fr_2105"></span>[2106](#fn_2105) Whence also Matthew for no other
reason said that he “came” unto Jesus, (whereas Luke most plainly
signifies that he came not unto Him himself, but sent his friends,) save
that by his most faithful humility he himself came unto Him more than
they whom he sent. Whence also is that of the Prophet, “The Lord is very
high, and hath respect unto things that are lowly: but what are very
high He noteth afar off;” <span id="fr_2106"></span>[2107](#fn_2106)
assuredly as not coming unto Him. Whence also He saith to that woman of
Canaan, “O woman, great is thy faith; be it done unto thee as thou
wilt;” <span id="fr_2107"></span>[2108](#fn_2107) whom above He had
called a dog, and had made answer that the bread of the sons was not to
be cast to her. And this she taking with humility had said, “Even so,
Lord; for the dogs also eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’
table.” And thus what by continual crying she obtained not, by humble
confession she earned. <span id="fr_2108"></span>[2109](#fn_2108) Hence
also those two are set forth praying in the Temple, the one a Pharisee,
and the other a Publican, for the sake of those who seem to themselves
just and despise the rest of men, and the confession of sins is set
before the reckoning up of merits. And assuredly the Pharisee was
rendering thanks unto God by reason of those things wherein he was
greatly self-satisfied. “I render thanks to Thee,” saith he, “that I am
not even as the rest of men, unjust, extortioners, adulterers, even as
also this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all
things whatsoever I possess. But the Publican was standing afar off, not
daring to lift up his eyes to Heaven, but beating his breast, saying,
God be merciful unto me a sinner.” But there follows the divine
judgment, “Verily I say unto you, the Publican went down from the Temple
justified more than that Pharisee.” <span
id="fr_2109"></span>[2110](#fn_2109) Then the cause is shown, why this
is just; “Forasmuch as he who exalteth himself shall be humbled, and
whoso humbleth himself shall be exalted.” Therefore it may come to pass,
that each one both shun real evils, and reflect on real goods in
himself, and render thanks for these unto “the Father of lights, from
Whom cometh down every best gift, and every perfect gift,” <span
id="fr_2110"></span>[2111](#fn_2110) and yet be rejected by reason of
the sin of haughtiness, if through pride, even in his thought alone,
which is before God, he insult other sinners, and specially when
confessing their sins in prayer, unto whom is due not upbraiding with
arrogance, but pity without despair. What is it that, when His disciples
were questioning among themselves, who of them should be greater, He set
a little child before their eyes, saying, “Unless ye shall be as this
child, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?” <span
id="fr_2111"></span>[2112](#fn_2111) Did He not chiefly commend
humility, and set in it the desert of greatness? Or when unto the sons
of Zebedee desiring to be at His side in lofty seats He so made
answer, <span id="fr_2112"></span>[2113](#fn_2112) as that they should
rather think of having to drink the Cup of His Passion, wherein He
humbled Himself even unto death, even the death of the Cross, <span
id="fr_2113"></span>[2114](#fn_2113) than with proud desire demand to be
preferred to the rest; what <span id="page_429">p. 429</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxxiii-Page_429"></span>did He show, save, that He would be a
bestower of exaltation upon them, who should first follow Him as a
teacher of humility? And now, in that, when about to go forth unto His
Passion, He washed the feet of His disciples, and most openly taught
them to do for their fellow-disciples and fellow-servants this, which He
their Lord and Master had done for them; how greatly did He commend
humility? <span id="fr_2114"></span>[2115](#fn_2114) And in order to
commend this He chose also that time, wherein they were looking on Him,
as immediately about to die, with great longing; assuredly about to
retain in their memory this especially, which their Master, Whom they
were to imitate, had pointed out to them as the last thing. But He did
this at that time, which surely He could have done on other days also
before, wherein He had been conversant with them; at which time if it
were done, this same would indeed be delivered, but certainly would not
be so received.
