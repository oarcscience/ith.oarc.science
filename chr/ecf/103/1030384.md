<span id="iv.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Of the Attainment of Cheerfulness
in the Duty of Catechising, and of Various Causes Producing Weariness in
the Catechumen.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xi-p2"></span>14. At this point you perhaps desiderate
some example of the kind of discourse intended, so that I may show you
by an actual instance how the things which I have recommended are to be
done. This indeed I shall do, so far as by God’s help I shall be able.
But before proceeding to that, it is my duty, in consistency with what I
have promised, to speak of the acquisition of the cheerfulness (to which
I have alluded). For as regards the matter of the rules in accordance
with which your discourse should be set forth, in the case of the
catechetical instruction of a person who comes with the express view of
being made a Christian, I have already made good, as far as has appeared
sufficient, the promise which I made. And surely I am under no
obligation at the same time to do myself in this volume that which I
enjoin as the right thing to be done. Consequently, if I do that, it
will have the value of an overplus. But how can the overplus be
super-added by me before I have filled up the measure of what is due?
Besides, one thing which I have heard you make the subject of your
complaint above all others, is the fact that your discourse seemed to
yourself to be poor and spiritless when you were instructing any one in
the Christian name. Now this, I know, results not so much from want of
matter to say, with which I am well aware you are sufficiently provided
and furnished, or from poverty of speech itself, as rather from
weariness of mind. And that may spring either from the cause of which I
have already spoken, namely, the fact that our intelligence is better
pleased and more thoroughly arrested by that which we perceive in
silence in the mind, and that we have no inclination to have our
attention called off from it to a noise of words coming far short of
representing it; or from the circumstance that even when discourse is
pleasant, we have more delight in hearing or reading things which have
been expressed in a superior manner, and which are set forth without any
care or anxiety on our part, than in putting together, with a view to
the comprehension of others, words suddenly conceived, and leaving it an
uncertain issue, on the one hand, whether such terms occur to us as
adequately represent the sense, and on the other, whether they be
accepted in such <span id="page_293">p. 293</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xi-Page_293"></span>a manner as to profit; or yet again, from
the consideration that, in consequence of their being now thoroughly
familiar to ourselves, and no longer necessary to our own advancement,
it becomes irksome to us to be recurring very frequently to those
matters which are urged upon the uninstructed, and our mind, as being by
this time pretty well matured, moves with no manner of pleasure in the
circle of subjects so well-worn, and, as it were, so childish. A sense
of weariness is also induced upon the speaker when he has a hearer who
remains unmoved, either in that he is actually not stirred by any
feeling, or in that he does not indicate by any motion of the body that
he understands or that he is pleased with what is said. <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391.md) Not that it is a becoming
disposition in us to be greedy of the praises of men, but that the
things which we minister are of God; and the more we love those to whom
we discourse, the more desirous are we that they should be pleased with
the matters which are held forth for their salvation: so that if we do
not succeed in this, we are pained, and we are weakened, and become
broken-spirited in the midst of our course, as if we were wasting our
efforts to no purpose. Sometimes, too, when we are drawn off from some
matter which we are desirous to go on with, and the transaction of which
was a pleasure to us, or appeared to be more than usually needful, and
when we are compelled, either by the command of a person whom we are
unwilling to offend, or by the importunity of some parties that we find
it impossible to get rid of, to instruct any one catechetically, in such
circumstances we approach a duty for which great calmness is
indispensable with minds already perturbed, and grieving at once that we
are not permitted to keep that order which we desire to observe in our
actions, and that we cannot possibly be competent for all things; and
thus out of very heaviness our discourse as it advances is less of an
attraction, because, starting from the arid soil of dejection, it goes
on less flowingly. Sometimes, too, sadness has taken possession of our
heart in consequence of some offense or other, and at that very time we
are addressed thus: “Come, speak with this person; he desires to become
a Christian.” For they who thus address us do it in ignorance of the
hidden trouble which is consuming us within. So it happens that, if they
are not the persons to whom it befits us to open up our feelings, we
undertake with no sense of pleasure what they desire; and then,
certainly, the discourse will be languid and unenjoyable which is
transmitted through the agitated and fuming channel of a heart in that
condition. Consequently, seeing there are so many causes serving to
cloud the calm serenity of our minds, in accordance with God’s will we
must seek remedies for them, such as may bring us relief from these
feelings of heaviness, and help us to rejoice in fervor of spirit, and
to be jocund in the tranquility of a good work. “For God loveth a
cheerful giver.” <span id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392.md)

<span id="iv.iii.xi-p5"></span>15. Now if the cause of our sadness lies
in the circumstance that our hearer does not apprehend what we mean, so
that we have to come down in a certain fashion from the elevation of our
own conceptions, and are under the necessity of dwelling long in the
tedious processes of syllables which come far beneath the standard of
our ideas, and have anxiously to consider how that which we ourselves
take in with a most rapid draught of mental apprehension is to be given
forth by the mouth of flesh in the long and perplexed intricacies of its
method of enunciation; and if the great dissimilarity thus felt (between
our utterance and our thought) makes it distasteful to us to speak, and
a pleasure to us to keep silence, then let us ponder what has been set
before us by Him who has “showed us an example that we should follow His
steps.” <span id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393.md) For however much our
articulate speech may differ from the vivacity of our intelligence, much
greater is the difference of the flesh of mortality from the equality of
God. And, neverless, “although He was in the same form, He emptied
Himself, taking the form of a servant,”—and so on down to the words “the
death of the cross.” <span id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394.md) What is
the explanation of this but that He made Himself “weak to the weak, in
order that He might gain the weak?” <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395.md) Listen to His follower as he
expresses himself also in another place to this effect: “For whether we
be beside ourselves, it is to God; or whether we be sober, it is for
your cause. For the love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus
judge that He died for all.” <span id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396.md)
And how, indeed, should one be ready to be spent for their souls, <span
id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397.md) if he should find it irksome to him
to bend himself to their ears? For this reason, therefore, He became a
little child in the midst of us, (and) like a <span id="page_294">p.
294</span> <span id="iv.iii.xi-Page_294"></span>nurse cherishing her
children. <span id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398.md) For is it a
pleasure to lisp shortened and broken words, unless love invites us? And
yet men desire to have infants to whom they have to do that kind of
service; and it is a sweeter thing to a mother to put small morsels of
masticated food into her little son’s mouth, than to eat up and devour
larger pieces herself. In like manner, accordingly, let not the thought
of the hen <span id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399.md) recede from your
heart, who covers her tender brood with her drooping feathers, and with
broken voice calls her chirping young ones to her, while they that turn
away from her fostering wings in their pride become a prey to birds. For
if intelligence brings delights in its purest recesses, it should also
be a delight to us to have an intelligent understanding of the manner in
which charity, the more complaisantly it descends to the lowest objects,
finds its way back, with all the greater vigor to those that are most
secret, along the course of a good conscience which witnesses that it
has sought nothing from those to whom it has descended except their
everlasting salvation.
