<span id="v.v.xv-p1"></span> 14. “How,” sayest thou, “is it not his
doing as well as theirs, when they would not do this, if he would do
that?” Why, at this rate we go housebreaking with house-breakers,
because if we did not shut the door, they would not break it open: and
we go and murder with highwaymen, if it chance we know that they are
going to do it, because if we killed them out of hand, they would not
kill others. Or, if a person confess to us that he is going to commit a
parricide, we commit it along with him, if, being able, we do not slay
him before he can do the deed when we can<span id="page_465">p.
465</span> <span id="v.v.xv-Page_465"></span>not in some other way
prevent or thwart him. For it may be said, word for word as before,
“Thou hast done it as well as he; for he had not done this, hadst thou
done that.” With my good will, neither ill should be done; but only the
one was in my power, and I could take care that this should not be done;
the other rested with another, and when by my good advice I could not
quench the purpose, I was not bound by my evil deed to thwart the doing.
It is therefore no approving of a sinner, that one refuses to sin for
him; and neither the one nor the other is liked by him who would that
neither were done; but in that which pertains to him, he hath the power
to do it or not, and with that he perpetrateth it not; in that which
pertains to another, he hath only the will to wish it or not, and with
that he condemneth. And therefore, on their offering those terms, and
saying, “If thou burn not incense, this shalt thou suffer;” if he should
answer, “For me, I choose neither, I detest both, I consent unto you in
none of these things:” in uttering these and the like words, which
certainly, because they would be true, would afford them no consent no
approbation of his, let him suffer at their hands what he might, to his
account would be set down the receipt of wrongs, to theirs the
commission of sins. “Ought he then,” it may be asked, “to suffer his
person to be violated rather than burn incense?” If the question be what
he ought, he ought to do neither. For should I say that he ought to do
any of these things, I shall approve this or that, whereas I reprobate
both. But if the question be, which of these he ought in preference to
avoid, not being able to avoid both but able to avoid one or other: I
will answer, “His own sin, rather than another’s; and rather a lighter
sin being his own, than a heavier being another’s.” For, reserving the
point for more diligent inquiry, and granting in the mean while that
violation of the person is worse than burning incense, yet the latter is
his own, the former another’s deed, although he had it done to him; now,
whose the deed, his the sin. For though murder is a greater sin than
stealing, yet it is worse to steal than to suffer murder. Therefore, if
it were proposed to any man that, if he would not steal he should be
killed, that is, murder should be committed upon him; being he could not
avoid both, he would prefer to avoid that which would be his own sin,
rather than that which would be another’s. Nor would the latter become
his act for being committed upon him, and because he might avoid it if
he would commit a sin of his own.
