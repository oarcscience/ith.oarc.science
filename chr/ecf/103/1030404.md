<span id="iv.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>A Treatise on Faith and the Creed.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.ii-p2.1"></span>Chapter 1.—Of the Origin and Object of the
Composition.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.iv.ii-p3.1"></span> Inasmuch</span> as it is a position, written
and established on the most solid foundation of apostolic teaching,
“that the just lives of faith;” <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519) and inasmuch also as this faith
demands of us the duty at once of heart and tongue,—for an apostle says,
“With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth
confession is made unto salvation,” <span
id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520) —it becomes us to be mindful both
of righteousness and of salvation. For, destined as we are to reign
hereafter in everlasting righteousness, we certainly cannot secure our
salvation from the present evil world, unless at the same time, while
laboring for the salvation of our neighbors, we likewise with the mouth
make our own profession of the faith which we carry in our heart. And it
must be our aim, by pious and careful watchfulness, to provide against
the possibility of the said faith sustaining any injury in us, on any
side, through the fraudulent artifices \[or, cunning fraud\] of the
heretics.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p6"></span>We have, however, the catholic faith in
the Creed, known to the faithful and committed to memory, contained in a
form of expression as concise as has been rendered admissible by the
circumstances of the case; the purpose of which \[compilation\] was,
that individuals who are but beginners and sucklings among those who
have been born again in Christ, and who have not yet been strengthened
by most diligent and spiritual handling and understanding of the divine
Scriptures, should be furnished with a summary, expressed in few words,
of those matters of necessary belief which were subsequently to be
explained to them in many words, as they made progress and rose to \[the
height of\] divine doctrine, on the assured and steadfast basis of
humility and charity. It is underneath these few words, therefore, which
are thus set in order in the Creed, that most heretics have endeavored
to conceal their poisons; whom divine mercy has withstood, and still
withstands, by the instrumentality of spiritual men, who have been
counted worthy not only to accept and believe the catholic faith as
expounded in those terms, but also thoroughly to understand and
apprehend it by the enlightenment imparted by the Lord. For it is
written, “Unless ye believe, ye shall not understand.” <span
id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521) But the handling of the faith is of
service for the protection of the Creed; not, however, to the intent
that this should itself be given instead of the Creed, to be committed
to memory and repeated by those who are receiving the grace of God, but
that it may guard the matters which are retained in the Creed against
the insidious assaults of the heretics, by means of catholic authority
and a more entrenched defence.
