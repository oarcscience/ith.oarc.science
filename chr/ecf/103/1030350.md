id="iv.ii.cii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 100.—The Will of God is Never
Defeated, Though Much is Done that is Contrary to His Will.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cii-p2"></span>These are the great works of the Lord,
sought out according to all His pleasure, <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290.md) and so wisely sought out, that when
the intelligent creation, both angelic and human, sinned, doing not His
will but their own, He used the very will of the creature which was
working in opposition to the Creator’s will as an instrument for
carrying out His will, the supremely Good thus turning to good account
even what is evil, to the condemnation of those whom in His justice He
has predestined to punishment, and to the salvation of those whom in His
mercy He has predestined to grace. For, as far as relates to their own
consciousness, these creatures did what God wished not to be done: but
in view of God’s omnipotence, they could in no wise effect their
purpose. For in the very fact that they acted in opposition to His will,
His will concerning them was fulfilled. And hence it is that “the works
of the Lord are great, sought out according to all His pleasure,”
because in a way unspeakably strange and wonderful, even what is done in
opposition to His will does not defeat His will. For it would not be
done did He not permit it (and of course His permission is not
unwilling, but willing); nor would a Good Being permit evil to be done
only that in His omnipotence He can turn evil into good.
