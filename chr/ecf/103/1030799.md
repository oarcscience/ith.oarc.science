this patience likewise be the gift of God, or to be attributed to
strength of the human will, by which patience, one who is separated from
the Church doth, not for the error which separated him but for the truth
of the Sacrament or Word which hath remained with him, for fear of pains
eternal suffer pains temporal. For we must take heed lest haply, if we
affirm that patience to be the gift of God, they in whom it is should be
thought to belong also to the kingdom of God; but if we deny it to be
the gift of God, we should be compelled to allow that without aid and
gift of God there can be in the will of man somewhat of good. Because it
is not to be denied that it is a good thing that a man believe he shall
undergo pain of eternal punishment if he shall deny Christ, and for that
faith endure and make light of any manner of punishment of man’s
inflicting.
