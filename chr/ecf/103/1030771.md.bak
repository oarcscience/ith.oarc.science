<span id="v.vii.xl-p1"></span> 39. For there is less sin, if people do
not praise the sinner in the desires of his soul, and speak good of him
who practiseth iniquities. <span id="fr_2603"></span>[2604](#fn_2603.md)
Now what is more an iniquity than to wish to be obeyed by inferiors, and
to refuse to obey superiors? The Apostle, I mean, not us: insomuch that
they even let their hair grow long: a matter, of which he would have no
disputing at all, saying, “If any chooseth to be contentious, we have no
such custom, neither the Church of God. <span
id="fr_2604"></span>[2605](#fn_2604.md) Now this I command;” <span
id="fr_2605"></span>[2606](#fn_2605.md) which gives us to understand that
it is not cleverness of reasoning that we are to look for, but authority
of one giving command to attend unto. For whereunto, I pray thee,
pertaineth this also, that people so openly against the Apostle’s
precepts wear long hair? Is it that there must be in such sort vacation,
that not even the barbers are to work? Or, because they say that they
<span id="page_523">p. 523</span> <span
id="v.vii.xl-Page_523"></span>imitate the Gospel birds, do they fear to
be, as it were, plucked, lest they be not able to fly? I shrink from
saying more against this fault, out of respect for certain long-haired
brethren, in whom, except this, we find much, and well-nigh every thing,
to venerate. But the more we love them in Christ, the more solicitously
do we admonish them. Nor are we afraid indeed, lest their humility
reject our admonition; seeing that we also desire to be admonished by
such as they, wherever we chance to stumble or to go aside. This then we
admonish so holy men, not to be moved by foolish quibblings of vain
persons, and imitate in this perversity them whom in all else they are
far from resembling. For those persons, hawking about a venal hypocrisy,
fear lest shorn sanctity be held cheaper than long-haired; because
forsooth he who sees them shall call to mind those ancients whom we read
of, Samuel and the rest who did not cut off their hair. <span
id="fr_2606"></span>[2607](#fn_2606.md) And they do not consider what is
the difference between that prophetic veil, and this unveiling which is
in the Gospel, of which the Apostle saith, “When thou shall go
over <span id="fr_2607"></span>[2608](#fn_2607.md) unto Christ, the veil
shall be taken away.” <span id="fr_2608"></span>[2609](#fn_2608.md) That,
namely, which was signified in the veil interposed between the face of
Moses and the beholding of the people Israel, <span
id="fr_2609"></span>[2610](#fn_2609.md) that same was also signified in
those times by the long hair of the Saints. For the same Apostle saith,
that long hair is also instead of a veil: by whose authority these men
are hard pressed. Seeing he saith openly, “If a man wear long hair, it
is a disgrace to him.” “The very disgrace,” say they, “we take upon us,
for desert of our sins:” holding out a screen of simulated humility, to
the end that under cover of it they may carry on their trade of
self-importance. <span id="fr_2610"></span>[2611](#fn_2610.md) Just as if
the Apostle were teaching pride when he says, “Every man praying or
prophesying with veiled head shameth his head;” <span
id="fr_2611"></span>[2612](#fn_2611.md) and, “A man ought not to veil his
head, forsomuch as he is the image and glory of God.” <span
id="fr_2612"></span>[2613](#fn_2612.md) Consequently he who says, “Ought
not,” knows not perchance how to teach humility! However, if this same
disgrace in time of the Gospel, which was a thing of a holy
meaning <span id="fr_2613"></span>[2614](#fn_2613.md) in time of Prophecy,
be by these people courted as matter of humility, then let them be
shorn, and veil their head with haircloth. Only then there will be none
of that attracting of people’s eyes in which they trade, <span
id="fr_2614"></span>[2615](#fn_2614.md) because Samson was veiled not with
haircloth, but with his long hair.
