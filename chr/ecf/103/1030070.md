<span id="iv.i.vi.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—They are Proud Who Think They
are Able, by Their Own Righteousness, to Be Cleansed So as to See
God.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vi.xvi-p2"></span>20. There are, however, some who think
themselves capable of being cleansed by their own righteousness, so as
to contemplate God, and to dwell in God; whom their very pride itself
stains above all others. For there is no <span id="page_80">p. 80</span>
<span id="iv.i.vi.xvi-Page_80"></span>sin to which the divine law is
more opposed, and over which that proudest of spirits, who is a mediator
to things below, but a barrier against things above, receives a greater
right of mastery: unless either his secret snares be avoided by going
another way, or if he rage openly by means of a sinful people (which
Amalek, being interpreted, means), and forbid by fighting the passage to
the land of promise, he be overcome by the cross of the Lord, which is
prefigured by the holding out of the hands of Moses. <span
id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521.md) For these persons promise themselves
cleansing by their own righteousness for this reason, because some of
them have been able to penetrate with the eye of the mind beyond the
whole creature, and to touch, though it be in ever so small a part, the
light of the unchangeable truth; a thing which they deride many
Christians for being not yet able to do, who, in the meantime, live by
faith alone. But of what use is it for the proud man, who on that
account is ashamed to embark upon the ship of wood, <span
id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522.md) to behold from afar his country beyond
the sea? Or how can it hurt the humble man not to behold it from so
great a distance, when he is actually coming to it by that wood upon
which the other disdains to be borne?
