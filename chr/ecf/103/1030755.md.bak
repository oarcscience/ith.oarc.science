<span id="v.vii.xxiv-p1"></span> 23. Hence arises another question; for
peradventure one may say, “What then? did the other Apostles, and the
brethren of the Lord, and Cephas, sin, in that they did not work? Or did
they occasion an hindrance to the Gospel, because blessed Paul saith
that he had not used this power on purpose that he might not cause any
hindrance to the Gospel of Christ? For if they sinned because they
wrought not, then had they not received power not to work, but to live
instead by the Gospel. But if they had received this power, by ordinance
of the Lord, that they which preach the Gospel should live by the
Gospel; and by His saying, “The workman is worthy of his meat;” which
power Paul, laying out somewhat more, <span
id="fr_2553"></span>[2554](#fn_2553.md) would not use; then truly they
sinned not. If they sinned not, they caused no hindrance. For it is not
to be thought no sin to hinder the Gospel. <span
id="fr_2554"></span>[2555](#fn_2554.md) If this be so, “to us also,” say
they, “it is free either to use or not to use this power.”
