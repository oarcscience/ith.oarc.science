<span id="iv.i.x.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.x.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—God Must First Be Known by an
Unerring Faith, that He May Be Loved.</span>

<span id="iv.i.x.v-p2"></span>6. But it is by love that we must stand
firm to this and cleave to this, in order that we may enjoy the presence
of that by which we are, and in the absence of which we could not be at
all. For as “we walk as yet by faith, and not by sight,” <span
id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) we certainly do not yet see God, as
the same \[apostle\] saith, “face to face:” <span
id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md) whom however we shall never see,
unless now already we love. But who loves what he does not know? For it
is possible something may be known and not loved: but I ask whether it
is possible that what is not known can be loved; since if it cannot,
then no one loves God before he knows Him. And what is it to know God
except to behold Him and steadfastly perceive Him with the mind? For He
is not a body to be searched out by carnal eyes. But before also that we
have power to behold and to perceive God, as He can be beheld and
perceived, which is permitted to the pure in heart; for “blessed are the
pure in heart. for they shall see God;” <span
id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) except He is loved by faith, it will
not be possible for the heart to be cleansed, in order that it may be
apt and meet to see Him. For where are there those three, in order to
build up which in the mind the whole apparatus of the divine Scriptures
has been raised up, namely Faith, Hope, and Charity, <span
id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) except in a mind believing what it
does not yet see, and hoping and loving what it believes? Even He
therefore who is not known, but yet is believed, can be loved. But
indisputably we must take care, lest the mind believing that which it
does not see, feign to itself something which is not, and hope for and
love that which is false. For in that case, it will not be charity out
of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned, which
is the end of the commandment, as the same apostle says. <span
id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md)

<span id="iv.i.x.v-p8"></span>7. But it must needs be, that, when by
reading or hearing of them we believe in any corporeal things which we
have not seen, the mind frames for itself something under bodily
features and forms, just as it may occur to our thoughts; which either
is not true, or even if it be true, which can most rarely happen, yet
this is of no benefit to us to believe in by faith, but it is useful for
some other purpose, which is intimated by means of it. For who is there
that reads or hears what the Apostle Paul has written, or what has been
written of him, that does not imagine to himself the countenance both of
the apostle himself, and of all those whose names are there mentioned?
And whereas, among such a multitude of men to whom these books are
known, each imagines in a different way those bodily features and forms,
it is assuredly uncertain which it is that imagines them more nearly and
more like the reality. Nor, indeed, is our faith busied therein with the
bodily countenance of those men; but only that by the grace of God they
so lived and so acted as that Scripture witnesses: this it is which it
is both useful to believe, and which must not be despaired of, and must
be sought. For even the countenance of our Lord Himself in the flesh is
variously fancied by the diversity of countless imaginations, which yet
was one, whatever it was. Nor in our faith which we have of our <span
id="page_119">p. 119</span> <span id="iv.i.x.v-Page_119"></span>Lord
Jesus Christ, is that wholesome which the mind imagines for itself,
perhaps far other than the reality, but that which we think of man
according to his kind: for we have a notion of human nature implanted in
us, as it were by rule, according to which we know forthwith, that
whatever such thing we see is a man or the form of a man.
