<span id="v.ii.iii-p1"></span> 2. Nor is it now necessary that we
enquire, and put forth a definite opinion on that question, whence could
exist the progeny of the first men, whom God had blessed, saying,
“Increase, and be ye multiplied, and fill the earth;” <span
id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934.md) if they had not sinned, whereas
their bodies by sinning deserved the condition of death, and there can
be no sexual intercourse save of mortal bodies. For there have existed
several and different opinions on this matter; and if we must examine,
which of them be rather agreeable to the truth of Divine Scriptures,
there is matter for a lengthened discussion. <span
id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935.md) Whether, therefore, without
intercourse, in some other way, had they not sinned, they would have had
sons, from the gift of the Almighty Creator, Who was able to create
themselves also without parents, Who was able to form the Flesh of
Christ in a virgin womb, and (to speak even to unbelievers themselves)
Who was able to bestow on bees a progeny without sexual intercourse; or
whether many things there were spoken by way of mystery and figure, and
we are to understand in another sense what is written, “Fill the earth,
and rule over it;” that is, that it should come to pass by fullness and
perfection of life and power, so that the very increase and
multiplication, whereby it is said, “Increase, and be ye multiplied,” be
understood to be by advance of mind, and abundance of virtue, as it is
set in the Psalm, “Thou shall multiply me in my soul by virtue;” <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936.md) and that succession of progeny was
not given unto man, save after that, by reason of sin, there was to be
hereafter departure in death: or whether the body was not made spiritual
in the case of these men, but at the first animal, in order that by
merit of obedience it might after become spiritual, to lay hold of
immortality, not after death, which by the malice of the devil entered
into the world, and was made the punishment of sin; but after that
change, which the Apostle signifies, when he says, “Then we living, who
remain, together with them, shall be caught up in the clouds, to meet
Christ, into the air,” <span id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937.md) that
we may understand both that those bodies of the first pair were mortal,
in the first forming, and yet that they would not have died, had they
not sinned, as God had threatened: even as if He should threaten a
wound, in that the body was capable of wounds; which yet would not have
happened, unless what He had forbidden were done. Thus, therefore, even
through sexual intercourse there might take place generations of such
bodies, as up to a certain point should have increase, and <span
id="page_400">p. 400</span> <span id="v.ii.iii-Page_400"></span>yet
should not pass into old age; or even into old age, and yet not into
death; until the earth were filled with that multiplication of the
blessing. For if to the garments of the Israelites <span
id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938.md) God granted their proper state
without any wearing away during forty years, how much more would He
grant unto the bodies of such as obeyed His command a certain most happy
temperament of sure state, until they should be changed for the better,
not by death of the man, whereby the body is abandoned by the soul, but
by a blessed change from mortality to immortality, from an animal to a
spiritual quality. Of these opinions which be true, or whether some
other or others yet may be formed out of these words, were a long matter
to enquire and discuss.
