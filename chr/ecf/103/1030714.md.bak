<span id="v.vi.xxvi-p1"></span> 25. Nor have I undertaken that in the
present discourse, as it more pertains to thee, who hast laid open the
hiding-places of the Priscillianists, so far as relates to their false
and perverse dogmas; that they may not seem to have been in such sort
investigated as if they were meet to be taught, not to be argued
against. Make it therefore more thy work that they be beaten down and
laid low, as thou hast made it, that they should be betrayed and laid
open; lest while we wish to get at the discovery of men practising
falsehood, we allow the falsehoods themselves, as if insuperable, to
stand their ground; when we ought rather even in the hearts of latent
heretics to destroy falsehoods, than by sparing falsehoods to find out
the deceivers who practise falsehood. Moreover, among those dogmas of
theirs which are to be subverted, is this which they dogmatize, namely,
that in order to hide religion religious people ought to lie, to that
degree that not only concerning other matters, not pertaining to
doctrine of religion, but concerning religion itself, it is meet to lie,
that it may not become exposed to aliens; to wit, that one may deny
Christ, in order that one may in the midst of His enemies be in secret a
Christian. This impious and nefarious dogma do thou likewise, I beseech
thee, overthrow; to bolster up which they in their argumentations do
gather from the Scriptures testimonies to make it appear that lies are
not only to be pardoned and tolerated, but even honored. To thee
therefore it pertains, in refuting that detestable sect, to show that
those testimonies of Scripture are so to be received, that either thou
shalt teach those to be no lies which are accounted to be such, if they
be understood in that manner in which they ought to be understood; or,
that those are not to be imitated which be manifestly lies; or in any
wise at last, that concerning those matters at least which pertain to
doctrine of religion, it is in no wise meet to tell a lie. For thus are
they truly from the very foundation overthrown, while that is overthrown
wherein they lurk: that in that very matter they be judged least fit for
us to follow, most fit to be shunned, in that they, for the hiding of
their heresy, do profess themselves liars. This it is in them that must
from the very first be assaulted, this which is, as it were, their
fitting bulwark must with blows of Truth be battered and cast down. Nor
must we afford them another lurking-place, which they had not, wherein
they may take refuge, to wit, that being perhaps betrayed of them whom
they have es<span id="page_493">p. 493</span> <span
id="v.vi.xxvi-Page_493"></span>sayed to seduce but could not, they
should say, “We only wanted to try them, because prudent Catholics have
taught that to find out heretics it is right to do this.” But it is
necessary with somewhat more earnest be-speaking of thy favor to say why
this seems to me a tripartite method of disputing against those who want
to apply the divine Scriptures as advocates of their lies; to wit, by
showing that some which are there accounted to be lies, are not what
they are accounted, if rightly understood; next, that if there be there
any manifest lies, they are not meet to be imitated; thirdly, contrary
to all opinions of all persons who think it pertains to the duty of a
good man sometimes to lie, that it must in every way be held that in
doctrine of religion there must in no wise a lie be told. For these are
the three things to follow up which I shortly before recommended, and in
some sort enjoined thee.
