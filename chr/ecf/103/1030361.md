id="iv.ii.cxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 111.—After the Resurrection There
Shall Be Two Distinct Kingdoms, One of Eternal Happiness, the Other of
Eternal Misery.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cxiii-p2"></span>After the resurrection, however, when
the final, universal judgment has been completed, there shall be two
kingdoms, each with its own distinct boundaries, the one Christ’s, the
other the devil’s; the one consisting of the good, the other of the
bad,—both, however, consisting of angels and men. The former shall have
no will, the latter no power, to sin, and neither shall have any power
to choose death; but the former shall live truly and happily in eternal
life, the latter shall drag a miserable existence in eternal death
without the power of dying; for the life and the death shall both be
without end. But among the former there shall be degrees of happiness,
one being more pre-eminently happy than another; and among the latter
there shall be degrees of misery, one being more endurably miserable
than another.
