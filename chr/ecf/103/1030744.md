<span id="v.vii.xiii"></span>

<span id="v.vii.xiii-p1"></span> 12. But now, that as bearing with the
infirmity of men he did this, let us hear what follows: “For though I be
free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might
gain the more. To them that are under the law, I became as under the
law, that I might gain them that are under the law; to them that are
without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under
the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.” <span
id="fr_2504"></span>[2505](#fn_2504) Which thing he did, not with
craftiness of simulation, but with mercy of compassion with others; that
is, not as if to feign himself a Jew, as some have thought, in that he
observed at Jerusalem the things prescribed by the old law. <span
id="fr_2505"></span>[2506](#fn_2505) For he did this in accordance with
his free and openly declared sentence, in which he says, “Is any called
being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised.” That is, let him
not so live, as though he had become uncircumcised, and covered that
which he had laid bare: as in another place he saith, “Thy circumcision
is become uncircumcision.” <span id="fr_2506"></span>[2507](#fn_2506) It
was in accordance then with this his sentence, in which he saith, “Is
any called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any
called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised;” <span
id="fr_2507"></span>[2508](#fn_2507) that he did those things, in which,
by persons not understanding and not enough attending, he has been
accounted to have feigned. For he was a Jew, and was called being
circumcised; therefore he would not become uncircumcised; that is, would
not so live as if he had not been circumcised. For this he now had in
his power to do. And “under” the law, indeed, he was not as they who
servilely wrought it; but yet “in” the law of God and of Christ. For
that law was not one, and the law of God another, as accursed Manicheans
are wont to say. Otherwise, if when he did those things he is to be
accounted to have feigned, then he feigned himself also a pagan, and
sacrificed to idols, because he says that he became to those without
law, as without law. By whom, doubtless, he would have us to understand
no other than Gentiles whom we call Pagans. It is one thing therefore to
be under the law, another in the law, another without law. “Under the
law,” the carnal Jews; “in the law,” spiritual men, both Jews and
Christians; (whence the former kept that custom of their fathers, but
did not impose unwonted burdens upon the believing Gentiles; and
therefore they also were circumcised;) but “without law,” are the
Gentiles which have not yet believed, to whom yet the Apostle testifieth
himself to have become like, through sympathy of a merciful heart, not
simulation of a changeable exterior; that is, that he might in that way
succor carnal Jew or Pagan, in which way himself, if he were that, would
have wished to be succored: bearing, to wit, their infirmity, in
likeness of compassion, not deceiving in fiction of lying; as he
straightway goes on, and says, “I became to the weak as weak, that I
might gain the weak.” <span id="fr_2508"></span>[2509](#fn_2508) For it
was from this point that he was speaking, in saying all those other
things. As then, that he became to the weak as weak, was no lie; so all
those other things above rehearsed. For what doth he mean his weakness
towards the weak to have been, but that of suffering with them, insomuch
that, lest he should appear to be a seller of the Gospel, and by falling
into an ill suspicion with ig<span id="page_510">p. 510</span> <span
id="v.vii.xiii-Page_510"></span>norant men, should hinder the course of
God’s word, he would not accept what by warrant of the Lord was his due?
Which if he were willing to accept, he would not in any wise lie,
because it was truly due to him; and for that he would not, he did not
in any wise lie. For he did not say, it was not due; but he showed it to
be due, and that being due he had not used it, and professed that he
would not at all use it, in that very thing becoming weak; namely, in
that he would not use his power; being, to wit, with so merciful
affection endued, that he thought in what way he should wish to be dealt
withal, if himself also were made so weak, that possibly, if he should
see them by whom the Gospel was preached to him, accepting their
charges, he might think it a bringing of wares to market, and hold them
in suspicion accordingly.
