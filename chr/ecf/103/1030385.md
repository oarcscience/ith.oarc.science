<span id="iv.iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Of the Remedy for the Second
Source of Weariness.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xii-p2"></span>16. If, however, it is rather our desire
to read or hear such things as are already prepared for our use and
expressed in a superior style, and if the consequence is that we feel it
irksome to put together, at the time and with an uncertain issue, the
terms of discourse on our own side, then, provided only that our mind
does not wander off from the truth of the facts themselves, it is an
easy matter for the hearer, if he is offended by anything in our
language, to come to see in that very circumstance how little value
should be set, supposing the subject itself to be rightly understood,
upon the mere fact that there may have been some imperfection or some
inaccuracy in the literal expressions, which were employed indeed simply
with the view of securing a correct apprehension of the subject-matter.
But if the bent of human infirmity has wandered off from the truth of
the facts themselves,—although in the catechetical instruction of the
unlearned, where we have to keep by the most beaten track, that cannot
occur very readily,—still, lest haply it should turn out that our hearer
finds cause of offence even in this direction, we ought not to deem this
to have come upon us in any other way than as the issue of God’s own
wish to put us to the test with respect to our readiness to receive
correction in calmness of mind, so as not to rush headlong, in the
course of a still greater error, into the defense of our error. But if,
again, no one has told us of it, and if the thing has altogether escaped
our own notice, as well as the observation of our hearers, then there is
nothing to grieve over, provided only the same thing does not occur a
second time. For the most part, however, when we recall what we have
said, we ourselves discover something to find fault with, and are
ignorant of the manner in which it was received when it was uttered; and
so when charity is fervent within us, we are the more vexed if the
thing, while really false, has been received with unquestioning
acceptance. This being the case, then, whenever an opportunity occurs,
as we have been finding fault with ourselves in silence, we ought in
like manner to see to it that those persons be also set right on the
subject in a considerate method, who have fallen into some sort of
error, not by the words of God, but plainly by those used by us. If, on
the other hand, there are any who, blinded by insensate spite, rejoice
that we have committed a mistake, whisperers as they are, and
slanderers, and “hateful to God,” <span
id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400.md) such characters should afford us
matter for the exercise of patience with pity, inasmuch as also the
“patience of God leadeth them to repentance.” <span
id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401.md) For what is more detestable, and
what more likely to “treasure up wrath in the day of wrath and
revelation of the righteous judgment of God,” <span
id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402.md) than to rejoice, after the evil
likeness and pattern of the devil, in the evil of another? At times,
too, even when all is correctly and truly spoken, either something which
has not been understood, or something which, as being opposed to the
idea and wont of an old error, seems harsh in its very novelty, offends
and disturbs the hearer. But if this becomes apparent, and if the person
shows himself capable of being set right, he should be set right without
any delay by the use of abundance of authorities and reasons. On the
other hand, if the offense is tacit and hidden, the medicine of God is
the effective remedy for it. And if, again, the person starts back and
declines to be cured, we should comfort ourselves with that example of
our Lord, who, when men were offended at His word, and shrank from it as
a hard saying, addressed Himself at the same time to those who had
remained, in these terms, “Will ye also go away?” <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403.md) For it ought to be retained as a
thoroughly “fixed and immovable” position in our heart, that <span
id="page_295">p. 295</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xii-Page_295"></span>Jerusalem which is in captivity is set
free from the Babylon of this world when the times have run their
course, and that none belonging to her shall perish: for whoever may
perish was not of her. “For the foundation of God standeth sure, having
this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His; and, let every one that
nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.” <span
id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404.md) If we ponder these things, and call
upon the Lord to come into our heart, we shall be less apprehensive of
the uncertain issues of our discourse, consequent on the uncertain
feelings of our hearers; and the very endurance of vexations in the
cause of a work of mercy will also be something pleasant to us, if we
seek not our own glory in the same. For then is a work truly good, when
the aim of the doer gets its impetus from charity, <span
id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405.md) and, as if returning to its own
place, rests again in charity. Moreover, the reading which delights us,
or any listening to an eloquence superior to our own, the effect of
which is to make us inclined to set a greater value upon it than upon
the discourse which we ourselves have to deliver, and so to lead us to
speak with a reluctant or tedious utterance, will come upon us in a
happier spirit, and will be found to be more enjoyable after labor.
Then, too, with a stronger confidence shall we pray to God to speak to
us as we wish, if we cheerfully submit to let Him speak by us as we are
able. Thus is it brought about that all things come together for good to
them that love God. <span id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406.md)
