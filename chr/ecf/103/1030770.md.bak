<span id="v.vii.xxxix-p1"></span> 38. These things, my brother Aurelius,
most dear unto me, and in the bowels of Christ to be venerated, so far
as He hath bestowed on me the ability Who through thee commanded me to
do it, touching work of Monks, I have not delayed to write; making this
my chief care, lest good brethren obeying apostolic precepts, should by
lazy and disobedient be called even prevaricators from the Gospel: that
they which work not, may at the least account them which do work to be
better than themselves without doubt. But who can bear that contumacious
persons resisting most wholesome admonitions of the Apostle, should, not
as weaker brethren be borne withal, but even be preached up as holier
men; insomuch that monasteries founded on sounder doctrine should be by
this double enticement corrupted, the dissolute license of vacation from
labor, and the false name of sanctity? Let it be known then to the rest,
our brethren and sons, who are accustomed to favor such men, and through
ignorance to defend this kind of presumption, that they need themselves
most chiefly to be corrected, in order that those may be corrected, nor
that they become “weary in well-doing.” <span
id="fr_2602"></span>[2603](#fn_2602.md) Truly, in that they do promptly and
with alacrity minister unto the servants of God the things they need,
not only we blame them not, but we most cordially embrace them: only let
them not with perverse mercy more hurt these men’s future life, than to
their present life they render aid.
