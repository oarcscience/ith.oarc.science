<span id="v.vii.xxxiii-p1"></span> 32. Some man will say: “What then
does it profit a servant of God, that, having left the former doings
which he had in the world he is converted unto the spiritual life and
warfare, if it still behove him to do business as of a common workman?”
As if truly it could be easily unfolded in words, how greatly profiteth
what the Lord, in answer to that rich man who was seeking counsel of
laying hold on eternal life, told him to do if he would fain be perfect:
sell that he had, distribute all to the indigence of the poor, and
follow Him? <span id="fr_2574"></span>[2575](#fn_2574.md) Or who with so
unimpeded course hath followed the Lord, as he who saith, “Not in vain
have I run, nor in vain labored?” <span
id="fr_2575"></span>[2576](#fn_2575.md) who yet both enjoined these works,
and did them. This unto us, being by so great authority taught and
informed, ought to suffice for a pattern of relinquishing our old
resources, and of working with our hands. But we too, aided by the Lord
Himself, are able perchance in some sort to apprehend what it doth still
profit the servants of God to have left their former businesses, while
they do yet thus work. For if a person from being rich is converted to
this mode of life, and is hindered by no infirmity of body, are we so
without taste of the savor of Christ, as not to understand what an
healing it is to the swelling of the old pride, when, having pared off
the superfluities by which erewhile the mind was deadly inflamed, he
refuses not, for the procuring of that little which is still naturally
necessary for this present life, even a common workman’s lowly toil? If
however he be from a poor estate converted unto this manner of life, let
him not account himself <span id="page_519">p. 519</span> <span
id="v.vii.xxxiii-Page_519"></span>to be doing that which he was doing
aforetime, if foregoing the love of even increasing his ever so small
matter of private substance, and now no more seeking his own but the
things which be Jesu Christ’s, <span
id="fr_2576"></span>[2577](#fn_2576.md) he hath translated himself into the
charity of a life in common, to live in fellowship of them who have one
soul and one heart to Godward, so that no man saith that any thing is
his own, but they have all things common. <span
id="fr_2577"></span>[2578](#fn_2577.md) For if in this earthly commonwealth
its chief men in the old times did, as their own men of letters are wont
in their most glowing phrase to tell of them, to that degree prefer the
common weal of the whole people of their city and country to their own
private affairs, that one of them, <span
id="fr_2578"></span>[2579](#fn_2578.md) for subduing of Africa honored with
a triumph, would have had nothing to give to his daughter on her
marriage, unless by decree of the senate she had been dowered from the
public treasury: of what mind ought he to be towards his commonwealth,
who is a citizen of that eternal City, the heavenly Jerusalem, but that
even what with labor of his own hands he earns, he should have in common
with his brother, and if the same lack any thing, supply it from the
common store; saying with him whose precept and example he hath
followed, “As having nothing, and possessing all things?” <span
