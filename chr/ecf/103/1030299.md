<span id="iv.ii.li-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter 49.—Christ Was Not Regenerated in the
Baptism of John, But Submitted to It to Give Us an Example of Humility,
Just as He Submitted to Death, Not as the Punishment of Sin, But to Take
Away the Sin of the World.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.li-p2"></span>Now, those who were baptized in the
baptism of John, by whom Christ was Himself baptized, <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169.md) were not regenerated; but they were
prepared through the ministry of His forerunner, who cried, “Prepare ye
the way of the Lord,” <span id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170.md) for Him
in whom only they could be regenerated. For His baptism is not with
water only, as was that of John, but with the Holy Ghost also; <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171.md) so that whoever believes in Christ
is regenerated by that Spirit, of whom Christ being generated, He did
not need regeneration. Whence that announcement of the Father which was
heard after His baptism, “This day have I begotten Thee,” <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172.md) referred not to that one day of
time on which He was baptized, but to the one day of an unchangeable
eternity, so as to show that this man was one in person with the
Only-begotten. For when a day neither begins with the close of
yesterday, nor ends with the beginning of to-morrow, it is an eternal
to-day. Therefore He asked to be baptized in water by John, not that any
iniquity of His might be washed away, but that He might manifest the
depth of His humility. For baptism found in Him nothing to wash away, as
death found in Him nothing to punish; so that it was in the strictest
justice, and not by the mere violence of power, that the devil was
crushed and conquered: for, as he had most unjustly put Christ to death,
though there was no sin in Him to deserve death, it was most just that
through Christ he should lose his hold of those who by sin were justly
subject to the bondage in which he held them. Both of these, then, that
is, both baptism and death, were submitted to by Him, not through a
pitiable necessity, but of His own free pity for us, and as part of an
arrangement by which, as one man brought sin into the world, that is,
upon the whole human race, so one man was to take away the sin of the
world.
