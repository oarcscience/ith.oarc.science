id="iv.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—The Creed and the Lord’s Prayer
Demand the Exercise of Faith, Hope, and Love.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.ix-p2"></span>For you have the Creed and the Lord’s
Prayer. What can be briefer to hear or to read? What easier to commit to
memory? <span id="page_239">p. 239</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ix-Page_239"></span>When, as the result of sin, the human race
was groaning under a heavy load of misery, and was in urgent need of the
divine compassion, one of the prophets, anticipating the time of God’s
grace, declared: “And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call
on the name of the Lord shall be delivered.” <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095.md) Hence the Lord’s Prayer. But the
apostle, when, for the purpose of commending this very grace, he had
quoted this prophetic testimony, immediately added: “How then shall they
call on Him in whom they have not believed?” <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096.md) Hence the Creed. In these two you
have those three graces exemplified: faith believes, hope and love pray.
But without faith the two last cannot exist, and therefore we may say
that faith also prays. Whence it is written: “How shall they call on Him
in whom they have not believed?”
