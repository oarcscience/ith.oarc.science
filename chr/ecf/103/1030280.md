<span id="iv.ii.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—Men are Not Saved by Good
Works, Nor by the Free Determination of Their Own Will, But by the Grace
of God Through Faith.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxxii-p2"></span>But this part of the human race to
which God has promised pardon and a share in His eternal kingdom, can
they be restored through the merit of their own works? God forbid. For
what good work can a lost man perform, except so far as he has been
delivered from perdition? Can they do anything by the free determination
of their own will? Again I say, God forbid. For it was by the evil use
of his free-will that man destroyed both it and himself. For, as a man
who kills himself must, of course, be alive when he kills himself, but
after he has killed himself ceases to live, and cannot restore himself
to life; so, when man by his own free-will sinned, then sin being
victorious over him, the freedom of his will was lost. “For of whom a
man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.” <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125) This is the judgment of the Apostle
Peter. And as it is certainly true, what kind of liberty, I ask, can the
bond-slave possess, except when it pleases him to sin? For he is freely
in bondage who does with pleasure the will of his master. Accordingly,
he who is the servant of sin is free to sin. And hence he will not be
free to do right, until, being freed from sin, he shall begin to be the
servant of righteousness. And this is true liberty, for he has pleasure
in the righteous deed; and it is at the same time a holy bondage, for he
is obedient to the will of God. But whence comes this liberty to do
right to the man who is in bondage and sold under sin, except he be
redeemed by Him who has said, “If the Son shall make you free, ye shall
be free indeed?” <span id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126) And before
this redemption is wrought in a man, when he is not yet free to do what
is right, how can he talk of the freedom of his will and his good works,
except he be inflated by that foolish pride of boasting which the
apostle restrains when he says, “By grace are ye saved, through
faith.” <span id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127)
