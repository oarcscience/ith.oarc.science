<span id="iv.i.xvi-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p3"></span>The true wisdom of man is treated of; and
it is shown that the image of God, which man is in respect to his mind,
is not placed properly in transitory things, as in memory,
understanding, and love, whether of faith itself as existing in time, or
even of the mind as busied with itself, but in things that are
permanent; and that this wisdom is then perfected, when the mind is
renewed in the knowledge of God, according to the image of Him who
created man after His own Image, and thus attains to wisdom, wherein
that which is contemplated is eternal.
