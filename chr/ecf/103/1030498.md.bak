<span id="v.i.xv-p1"></span> 15. And there are also they who in excuse
of their sins so accuse God, as to say that sins are pleasing to Him.
For, if they were displeasing, say they, surely by His most Almighty
power He would by no means suffer them to take place. As though indeed
God suffered sins to be unpunished, even in the case of those whom by
remission of sins He frees from eternal punishment! No one forsooth
receives pardon of more grievous punishment due, unless he hath suffered
some punishment, be it what it may, although far less than what was due:
and the fullness of mercy is so conveyed, as that the justice also of
discipline is not abandoned. For also sin, which seems unavenged, hath
its own attendant punishment, so that there is no one but by reason of
what he hath done either suffers pain from bitterness, or suffers not
through blindness. As therefore you say, Why doth He permit those
things, if they are displeasing? so I say, Why doth He punish them, if
they are pleasing? And thus, as I confess that those things would not
take place at all, unless they were permitted by the Almighty, so
confess thou that what are punished by the Just One ought not to be
done; in order that, by not doing what He punishes, we may deserve to
learn of Him, why He permits to exist what He punishes. For, as it is
written, “solid food is for the perfect,” <span
id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) wherein they who have made good
progress already understand, that it pertained rather unto the Almighty
power of God, to allow the existence of evils coming from the free
choice of the will. So great forsooth is His Almighty goodness, as that
even of evil He can make good, either by pardoning, or by healing, or by
fitting and turning unto the profit of the pious, or even by most justly
taking vengeance. For all these are good, and most worthy a good and
Almighty God: and yet they are not made save of evils. What therefore
better, what more Almighty, than He, Who, whereas He maketh no evil,
even of evils maketh well? They who have done ill cry unto Him, “Forgive
us our debts;” <span id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) He hears, He
pardons. Their own evils have hurt the sinners; He helps and heals their
sicknesses. The enemies of His people rage; of their rage He makes
martyrs. Lastly, also, He condemns those, whom He judges worthy of
condemnation; although they suffer their own evils, yet He doeth what is
good. For what is just cannot but be good, and assuredly as sin is
unjust, so the punishment of sin is just.
