id="iv.ii.lxxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 85.—The Case of Abortive
Conceptions.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxxvii-p2"></span>Hence in the first place arises a
question about abortive conceptions, which have indeed been born in the
mother’s womb, but not so born that they could be born again. For if we
shall decide that these are to rise again, we cannot object to any
conclusion that may be drawn in regard to those which are fully formed.
Now who is there that is not rather disposed to think that unformed
abortions perish, like seeds that have never fructified? But who will
dare to deny, though he may not dare to affirm, that at the resurrection
every defect in the form shall be supplied, and that thus the perfection
which time would have brought shall not be wanting, any more than the
blemishes which time did bring shall be present: so that the nature
shall neither want anything suitable and in harmony with it that length
of days would have added, nor be debased by the presence of anything of
an opposite kind that length of days has added; but that what is not yet
complete shall be completed, just as what has been injured shall be
renewed.
