id="iv.i.iv.i-p1.1"></span>Preface.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iv.i.iv.i-p2.1"></span>When</span> men seek to know God, and bend
their minds according to the capacity of human weakness to the
understanding of the Trinity; learning, as they must, by experience, the
wearisome difficulties of the task, whether from the sight itself of the
mind striving to gaze upon light unapproachable, or, indeed, from the
manifold and various modes of speech employed in the sacred writings
(wherein, as it seems to me, the mind is nothing else but roughly
exercised, in order that it may find sweetness when glorified by the
grace of Christ);—such men, I say, when they have dispelled every
ambiguity, and arrived at something certain, ought of all others most
easily to make allowance for those who err in the investigation of so
deep a secret. But there are two things most hard to bear with, in the
case of those who are in error: hasty assumption before the truth is
made plain; and, when it has been made plain, defence of the falsehood
thus hastily assumed. From which two faults, inimical as they are to the
finding out of the truth, and to the handling of the divine and sacred
books, should God, as I pray and hope, defend and protect me with the
shield of His good will, <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) and
with the grace of His mercy, I will not be slow to search out the
substance of God, whether through His Scripture or through the creature.
For both of these are set forth for our contemplation to this end, that
He may Himself be sought, and Himself be loved, who inspired the one,
and created the other. Nor shall I be afraid of giving my opinion, in
which I shall more desire to be examined by the upright, than fear to be
carped at by the perverse. For charity, most excellent and unassuming,
gratefully accepts the dovelike eye; but for the dog’s tooth nothing
remains, save either to shun it by the most cautious humility, or to
blunt it by the most solid truth; and far rather would I be censured by
any one whatsoever, than be praised by either the erring or the
flatterer. For the lover of truth need fear no one’s censure. For he
that censures, must needs be either enemy or friend. And if an enemy
reviles, he must be borne with: but a friend, if he errs, must be
taught; if he teaches, listened to. But if one who errs praises you, he
confirms your error; if one who flatters, he seduces you into error.
“Let the righteous,” therefore, “smite me, it shall be a kindness; and
let him reprove me; but the oil of the sinner shall not anoint my
head.” <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md)
