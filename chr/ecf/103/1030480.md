<span id="iv.vii.xvi-p1"></span> 16. In three ways then are sins
remitted in the Church; by Baptism, by prayer, by the greater humility
of penance; yet God doth not remit sins but to the baptized. The very
sins which He remits first, He remits not but to the baptized. When?
when they are baptized. The sins which are after remitted upon prayer,
upon penance, to whom He remits, it is to the baptized that He
remitteth. For how can they say, “Our Father,” who are not yet born
sons? The Catechumens, so long as they be such, have upon them all their
sins. If Catechumens, how much more Pagans? how much more heretics? But
to heretics we do not change their baptism. Why? because they have
baptism in the same way as a deserter has the soldier’s mark: <span
id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805) just so these also have Baptism;
they have it, but to be condemned thereby, not crowned. And yet if the
deserter himself, being amended, begin to do duty as a soldier, does any
man dare to change his mark?
