<span id="iv.ii.lv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 53.—Christ’s Cross and Burial,
Resurrection, Ascension, and Sitting Down at the Right Hand of God, are
Images of the Christian Life.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lv-p2"></span>All the events, then, of Christ’s
crucifixion, <span id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span
id="iv.ii.lv-Page_255"></span>of His burial, of His resurrection the
third day, of His ascension into heaven, of His sitting down at the
right hand of the Father, were so ordered, that the life which the
Christian leads here might be modelled upon them, not merely in a
mystical sense, but in reality. For in reference to His crucifixion it
is said: “They that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh, with the
affections and lusts.” <span id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178.md) And in
reference to His burial: “We are buried with Him by baptism into
death.” <span id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179.md) In reference to His
resurrection: “That, like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the
glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of
life.” <span id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180.md) And in reference to
His ascension into heaven and sitting down at the right hand of the
Father: “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection
on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your
life is hid with Christ in God.” <span
