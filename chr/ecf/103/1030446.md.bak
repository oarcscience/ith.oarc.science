<span id="iv.vi.xx-p1"></span> 19. The case standing thus, suppose, as I
said, that we are now for the first time seeking unto what religion we
shall deliver up our souls, for it to cleanse and renew them; without
doubt we must begin with the Catholic Church. For by this time there are
more Christians, than if the Jews and idolaters be added together. But
of these same Christians, whereas there are several heresies, and all
wish to appear Catholics, and call all others besides themselves
heretics, there is one <span id="page_356">p. 356</span> <span
id="iv.vi.xx-Page_356"></span>Church, as all allow: if you consider the
whole world, more full filled in number; but, as they who know affirm,
more pure also in truth than all the rest. But the question of truth is
another; but, what is enough for such as are in search, there is one
Catholic, to which different heresies give different names whereas they
themselves are called each by names of their own, which they dare not
deny. From which may be understood, by judgment of umpires who are
hindered by no favor, to which is to be assigned the name Catholic,
which all covet. But, that no one may suppose that it is to be made
matter of over garrulous or unnecessary discussion, this is at any rate
one, in which human laws themselves also are in a certain way Christian.
I do not wish any prejudgment to be formed from this fact, but I account
it a most favorable commencement for enquiry. For we are not to fear
lest the true worship of God; resting on no strength of its own, seem to
need to be supported by them whom it ought to support: but, at any rate,
it is perfect happiness, if the truth may be there found, where it is
most safe both to search for it and to hold it: in case it cannot, then
at length, at whatever risk, we must go and search some other where.
