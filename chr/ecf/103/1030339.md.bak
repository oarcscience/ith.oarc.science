<span id="iv.ii.xci-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xci-p1.1"></span>Chapter 89.—But This Material May Be
Differently Arranged in the Resurrection Body.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xci-p2"></span>And this earthly material, which when the
soul leaves it becomes a corpse, shall not at the resurrection be so
restored as that the parts into which it is separated, and which under
various forms and appearances become parts of other things (though they
shall all return to the same body from which they were separated), must
necessarily return to the same parts of the body in which they were
originally situated. For otherwise, to suppose that the hair recovers
all that our frequent clippings and shavings have taken away from it,
and the nails all that we have so often pared off, presents to the
imagination such a picture of ugliness and deformity, as to make the
resurrection of the body all but incredible. But just as if a statue of
some soluble metal were either melted by fire, or broken into dust, or
reduced to a shapeless mass, <span id="page_266">p. 266</span> <span
id="iv.ii.xci-Page_266"></span>and a sculptor wished to restore it from
the same quantity of metal, it would make no difference to the
completeness of the work what part of the statue any given particle of
the material was put into, as long as the restored statue contained all
the material of the original one; so God, the Artificer of marvellous
and unspeakable power, shall with marvellous and unspeakable rapidity
restore our body, using up the whole material of which it originally
consisted. Nor will it affect the completeness of its restoration
whether hairs return to hairs, and nails to nails, or whether the part
of these that had perished be changed into flesh, and called to take its
place in another part of the body, the great Artist taking careful heed
that nothing shall be unbecoming or out of place.
