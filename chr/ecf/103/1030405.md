<span id="iv.iv.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—Of God and His Exclusive
Eternity.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p2"></span>2. For certain parties have attempted to
gain acceptance for the opinion that <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.iv.iii-p2.1"></span>God the Father</span> is not <span
class="c19"><span id="iv.iv.iii-p2.2"></span> Almighty</span>: not that
they have been bold enough expressly to affirm this, but in their
traditions they are convicted of entertaining and crediting such a
notion. For when they affirm that there is a nature <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522) which God Almighty did not create,
but of which at the same time He fashioned this world, which they admit
to have been disposed in beauty, <span
id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523) they thereby deny that God is
almighty, to the effect of not believing that He could have created the
world without employing, for the purpose of its construction, another
nature, which had been in existence previously, and which He Himself had
not made. Thus, forsooth, \[they reason\] from their carnal familiarity
with the sight of craftsmen and house-builders, and artisans of all
descriptions, who have no power to make good the effect of their own art
unless they get the help of materials already prepared. And so these
parties in like manner understand the Maker of the world not to be
almighty, if <span id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524) thus He could
not fashion the said world without the help of some other nature, not
framed by Himself, which He had to use as His materials. Or if indeed
they do allow God, the Maker of the world, to be almighty, it becomes
matter of course that they must also acknowledge that He made out of
nothing the things which He did make. For, granting that He is almighty,
there cannot exist anything of which He should not be the Creator. For
although He made something out of something, as man out of clay, <span
id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525) nevertheless He certainly did not
make any object out of aught which He Himself had not made; for the
earth from which the clay comes He had made out of nothing. And even if
He had made out of some material the heavens and the earth themselves,
that is to say, the universe and all things which are in it, according
as it is written, “Thou who didst make the world out of matter
unseen,” <span id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526) or also “without
form,” as some copies give it; yet we are under no manner of necessity
to believe that this very material of which the universe was made,
although it might be “without form,” although it might be “unseen,”
whatever might be the mode of its subsistence, could possibly have
subsisted of itself, as if it were co-eternal and co-eval with God. But
whatsoever that mode was which it possessed to the effect of subsisting
in some manner, whatever that manner might be, and of being capable of
taking on the forms of distinct things, this it did not possess except
by the hand of Almighty God, by whose goodness it is that everything
exists,—not only every object which is already formed, but also every
object which is formable. This, moreover, is the difference between the
formed and the formable, that the formed has already taken on form,
while the formable is capable of taking the same. But the same Being who
imparts form to objects, also imparts the capability of being formed.
For of Him and in Him is the fairest figure <span
id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527) of all things, unchangeable; and
therefore He Himself is One, who communicates to everything its
possibilities, not only that it be beautiful actually, but also that it
be capable of being beautiful. For which reason we do most right to
believe that God made all things of nothing. For, even although the
world was made of some sort of material, this self-same material itself
was made of nothing; so that, in accordance with the most orderly gift
of God, there was to enter first the capacity of taking forms, and then
that all things should be formed which have been formed. This, however,
we have said, in order that no one might suppose that the utterances of
the divine Scriptures are contrary the one to the other, in so far as it
is written at once that God made all things of nothing, and that the
world was made of matter without form.

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p9"></span>3. As we believe, therefore, in <span
class="c19"><span id="iv.iv.iii-p9.1"></span>God</span> the <span
class="c19"><span id="iv.iv.iii-p9.2"></span>Father Almighty</span>, we
ought to uphold the opinion that there is no creature which has not been
created by the Almighty. And since He created all things by the
Word, <span id="fr_1528"></span>[1529](#fn_1528) which Word is also
designated the Truth, and the Power, and the Wisdom of God, <span
id="fr_1529"></span>[1530](#fn_1529) —as also under many other
appellations the Lord Jesus Christ, who <span
id="fr_1530"></span>[1531](#fn_1530) is commended to our faith, is
presented likewise to our mental apprehensions, to wit, our Deliverer
and Ruler, <span id="fr_1531"></span>[1532](#fn_1531) the Son of God;
for that Word, by whose means all things were founded, could not have
been begotten by any other than by Him who founded all things by His
instrumentality;—
