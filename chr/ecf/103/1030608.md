<span id="v.iii.lv-p1"></span> 54. Lo, already ye are such, as that in
the rest of your conduct also ye correspond with the virginity which ye
have professed and kept. Lo, already not only do ye abstain from
murders, devilish sacrifices and abominations, thefts, rapines, frauds,
perjuries, drunkennesses, and all luxury and avarice, hatreds,
emulations, impieties, cruelties; but even those things, which either
are, or are thought, lighter, are not found nor arise among you: not
bold face, not wandering eyes, not unbridled tongue, not petulant laugh,
not scurrilous jest, not unbecoming mien, not swelling or loose gait;
already ye render not evil for evil, nor curse for curse; <span
id="fr_2215"></span>[2216](#fn_2215) already, lastly, ye fulfill that
measure of love, that ye lay down your lives for your brethren. <span
id="fr_2216"></span>[2217](#fn_2216) Lo, already ye are such, because
also such ye ought to be. These, being added to virginity, set forth an
angelic life unto men, and the ways of heaven unto the earth. But, by
how much ye are great, whosoever of you are so great, “by so much humble
yourselves in all things, that ye may find grace before God,” that He
resist you not as proud, that He humble you not as lifting up
yourselves, that He lead you not through straits as being puffed up:
although anxiety be unnecessary, that, where Charity glows, humility be
not wanting.
