<span id="v.i.xxx-p1"></span> 30. But, after that he had made mention of
these evils, he added and said, “On account of which cometh the wrath of
God on the sons of unbelief.” <span id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922)
Surely it was a wholesome alarm that believers might not think that they
could be saved on account of their faith alone, even although they
should live in these evils: the Apostle James with most clear speech
crying out against that notion, and saying, “If any say that he have
faith, and have not works, shall his faith be able to save him?” <span
id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923) Whence also here the Teacher of the
Gentiles said, that on account of these evils the wrath of God cometh on
the sons of unbelief. But when he saith, “Wherein ye also walked
sometime, when ye were living therein;” <span
id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924) he shows sufficiently that now they
were not living therein. Forsooth unto these they had died, that their
life might be hidden in God with Christ. When then they were now not
living in them, they were now bidden to mortify such. Forsooth,
themselves not living in the same, the things were living, as I have
already shown a little above, and were called their members, that is to
say, those faults which dwelt in their members; by a way of speech, that
which is contained through that which contains; as it is said, The whole
Forum talks of it, when men talk who are in the Forum. In this very way
of speech it is sung in the Psalm, “Let all the earth worship
Thee:” <span id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925) that is, all men who
are in the earth.
