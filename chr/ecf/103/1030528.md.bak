<span id="v.ii.xii-p1"></span> 11. And yet not to these themselves is
marriage a sin; which, if it were chosen in comparison of fornication,
would be a less sin than fornication, and yet would be a sin. But now
what shall we say against the most plain speech of the Apostle, saying,
“Let her do what she will; she sinneth not, if she be married;” <span
id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965.md) and, “If thou shalt have taken a
wife, thou hast not sinned: and, if a virgin shall have been married,
she sinneth not.” <span id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966.md) Hence
surely it is not lawful now to doubt that marriage is no sin. Therefore
the Apostle alloweth not marriage as matter “of pardon:” <span
id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967.md) for who can doubt that it is
extremely absurd to say, that they have not sinned, unto whom “pardon”
is granted. But he allows, as matter of “pardon,” that sexual
intercourse, which takes place through incontinence, not alone for the
begetting of children, and, at times, not at all for the begetting of
children; and it is not that marriage forces this to take place, but
that it procures pardon for it; provided however it be not so in excess
as to hinder what ought to be set aside as seasons of prayer, nor be
changed into that use which is against nature, on which the Apostle
could not be silent, when speaking of the excessive corruptions of
unclean and impious men. For necessary sexual intercourse for begetting
is free from blame, and itself is alone worthy of marriage. But that
which goes beyond this necessity, no longer follows reason, but
lust. <span id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968.md) And yet it pertains to
the character of marriage, not to exact this, but to yield it to the
partner, lest by fornication the other sin damnably. But, if both are
set under such lust, they do what is plainly not matter of marriage.
However, if in their intercourse they love what is honest more than what
is dishonest, that is, what is matter of marriage more than what is not
matter of marriage, this is allowed to them on the authority of the
Apostle as matter of pardon: and for this fault, they have in their
marriage, not what sets them on to commit it, but what entreats pardon
for it, if they turn not away from them the mercy of God, either by not
abstaining on certain days, that they may be free to pray, and through
this abstinence, as through fasting, may commend their prayers; or by
changing the natural use into that which is against nature, which is
more damnable when it is done in the case of husband or wife.
