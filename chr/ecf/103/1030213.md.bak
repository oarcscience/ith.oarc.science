<span id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—The Mind Loves God in Rightly
Loving Itself; And If It Love Not God, It Must Be Said to Hate Itself.
Even a Weak and Erring Mind is Always Strong in Remembering,
Understanding, and Loving Itself. Let It Be Turned to God, that It May
Be Blessed by Remembering, Understanding, and Loving Him.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p2"></span>18. But there are yet more testimonies
in the divine Scriptures concerning the love of God. For in it, those
other two \[namely, memory and understanding\] are understood by
consequence, inasmuch as no one loves that which he does not remember,
or of which he is wholly ignorant. And hence is that well known and
primary commandment, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God.” <span
id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890.md) The human mind, then, is so
constituted, that at no time does it not remember, and understand, and
love itself. But since he who hates any one is anxious to injure him,
not undeservedly is the mind of man also said to hate itself when it
injures itself. For it wills ill to itself through ignorance, in that it
does not think that what it wills is prejudicial to it; but it none the
less does will ill to itself, when it wills what would be prejudicial to
it. And hence it is written, “He that loveth iniquity, hateth his own
soul.” <span id="fr_891"></span>[892](#fn_891.md) He, therefore, who knows
how to love himself, loves God; but <span id="page_193">p. 193</span>
<span id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-Page_193"></span>he who does not love God, even
if he does love himself,—a thing implanted in him by nature,—yet is not
unsuitably said to hate himself, inasmuch as he does that which is
adverse to himself, and assails himself as though he were his own enemy.
And this is no doubt a terrible delusion, that whereas all will to
profit themselves, many do nothing but that which is most pernicious to
themselves. When the poet was describing a like disease of dumb animals,
“May the gods,” says he, “grant better things to the pious, and assign
that delusion to enemies. They were rending with bare teeth their own
torn limbs.” <span id="fr_892"></span>[893](#fn_892.md) Since it was a
disease of the body he was speaking of, why has he called it a delusion,
unless because, while nature inclines every animal to take all the care
it can of itself, that disease was such that those animals rent those
very limbs of theirs which they desired should be safe and sound? But
when the mind loves God, and by consequence, as has been said remembers
and understands Him, then it is rightly enjoined also to love its
neighbor as itself; for it has now come to love itself rightly and not
perversely when it loves God, by partaking of whom that image not only
exists, but is also renewed so as to be no longer old, and restored so
as to be no longer defaced, and beatified so as to be no longer unhappy.
For although it so love itself, that, supposing the alternative to be
proposed to it, it would lose all things which it loves less than itself
rather than perish; still, by abandoning Him who is above it, in
dependence upon whom alone it could guard its own strength, and enjoy
Him as its light, to whom it is sung in the Psalm, “I will guard my
strength in dependence upon Thee,” <span
id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893.md) and again, “Draw near to Him, and be
enlightened,” <span id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894.md) —it has been made
so weak and so dark, that it has fallen away unhappily from itself too,
to those things that are not what itself is, and which are beneath
itself, by affections that it cannot conquer, and delusions from which
it sees no way to return. And hence, when by God’s mercy now penitent,
it cries out in the Psalms, “My strength faileth me; as for the light of
mine eyes, it also is gone from me.” <span
id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895.md)

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p9"></span>19. Yet, in the midst of these evils
of weakness and delusion, great as they are, it could not lose its
natural memory, understanding and love of itself. And therefore what I
quoted above <span id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896.md) can be rightly
said, “Although man walketh in an image, surely he is disquieted in
vain: he heapeth up treasures, and knoweth not who shall gather
them.” <span id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897.md) For why does he heap up
treasures, unless because his strength has deserted him, through which
he would have God, and so lack nothing? And why cannot he tell for whom
he shall gather them, unless because the light of his eyes is taken from
him? And so he does not see what the Truth saith, “Thou fool, this night
thy soul shall be required of thee. Then whose shall those things be
which thou hast provided?” <span id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898.md) Yet
because even such a man walketh in an image, and the man’s mind has
remembrance, understanding, and love of itself; if it were made plain to
it that it could not have both, while it was permitted to choose one and
lose the other, *viz*. either the treasures it has heaped up, or the
mind; who is so utterly without mind, as to prefer to have the treasures
rather than the mind? For treasures commonly are able to subvert the
mind, but the mind that is not subverted by treasures can live more
easily and unencumberedly without any treasures. But who will be able to
possess treasures unless it be by means of the mind? For if an infant,
born as rich as you please, although lord of everything that is
rightfully his, yet possesses nothing if his mind be unconscious, how
can any one possibly possess anything whose mind is wholly lost? But why
say of treasures, that anybody, if the choice be given him, prefers
going without them to going without a mind; when there is no one that
prefers, nay, no one that compares them, to those lights of the body, by
which not one man only here and there, as in the case of gold, but every
man, possesses the very heaven? For every one possesses by the eyes of
the body whatever he gladly sees. Who then is there, who, if he could
not keep both, but must lose one, would not rather lose his treasures
than his eyes? And yet if it were put to him on the same condition,
whether he would rather lose eyes than mind, who is there with a mind
that does not see that he would rather lose the former than the latter?
For a mind without the eyes of the flesh is still human, but the eyes of
the flesh without a mind are bestial. And who would not rather be a man,
even though blind in fleshly sight, than a beast that can see?

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p13"></span>20. I have said thus much, that even
those who are slower of understanding, to whose eyes or ears this book
may come, might be admonished, however briefly, how greatly even a weak
and erring mind loves itself, in wrongly loving and pursuing things
beneath itself. Now it could not love itself if it <span
id="page_194">p. 194</span> <span id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-Page_194"></span>were
altogether ignorant of itself, *i.e.* if it did not remember itself, nor
understand itself by which image of God within itself it has such power
as to be able to cleave to Him whose image it is. For it is so reckoned
in the order, not of place, but of natures, as that there is none above
it save Him. When, finally, it shall altogether cleave to Him, then it
will be one spirit, as the apostle testifies, saying, “But he who
cleaves to the Lord is one spirit.” <span
id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899.md) And this by its drawing near to
partake of His nature, truth, and blessedness, yet not by His increasing
in His own nature, truth and blessedness. In that nature, then, when it
happily has cleaved to it, it will live unchangeably, and will see as
unchangeable all that it does see. Then, as divine Scripture promises,
“His desire will be satisfied with good things,” <span
id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900.md) good things unchangeable,—the very
Trinity itself, its own God, whose image it is. And that it may not ever
thenceforward suffer wrong, it will be in the hidden place of His
presence, <span id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901.md) filled with so great
fullness of Him, that sin thenceforth will never delight it. But now,
when it sees itself, it sees something not unchangeable.
