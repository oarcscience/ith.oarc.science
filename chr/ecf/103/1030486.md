<span id="v.i.iii-p1"></span> 3. Lastly, to show more plainly the inner
mouth, which by these words he meant, after having said, “Set a watch, O
Lord, to my mouth, and a door of Continence around my lips,” he added
straightway, “Cause not my heart to fall aside into evil words.” <span
id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810) The falling aside of the heart,
what is it but the consent? For he hath not yet spoken, whosoever in his
heart hath with no falling aside of the heart consented unto suggestions
that meet him of each several thing that is seen. But, if he hath
consented, he hath already spoken in his heart, although he hath not
uttered sound by the mouth; although he hath not done with hand or any
part whatever of the body, yet hath he done what in his thought he hath
already determined that he is to do: guilty by the divine laws, although
hidden to human senses; the word having been spoken in the heart, no
deed having been committed through the body. But in no case would he
have moved the limb without, in a deed, the beginning of which deed had
not gone before within in word. For it is no lie that is written, that
“the beginning of every work is a word.” <span
id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811) Forsooth men do many things with
mouth closed, tongue quiet, voice bridled; but yet they do nothing by
work of the body, which they have not before spoken in the heart. And
through this since there are many sins in inward sayings which are not
in outward deeds, whereas there are none in outward deeds, which do not
go before in inward sayings, there will be purity of innocence from
both, if the door of Continence be set around the inward lips.
