<span id="v.ii.xiv-p1"></span> 13. What therefore he says, “She, that is
unmarried, thinketh of the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both
in body and spirit;” we are not to take in such sense, as to think that
a chaste Christian wife is not holy in body. Forsooth unto all the
faithful it was said, “Know ye not that your bodies are a temple of the
Holy Ghost within you, Whom ye have from God?” <span
id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970) Therefore the bodies also of the
married are holy, so long as they keep faith to one another and to God.
And that this sanctity of either of them, even an unbelieving partner
does not stand in the way of, but rather that the sanctity of the wife
profits the unbelieving husband, and the sanctity of the husband profits
the unbelieving wife, the same Apostle is witness, saying, “For the
unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife
is sanctified in a brother.” <span id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971)
Wherefore that was said according to the greater sanctity of the
unmarried than of the married, unto which there is also due a greater
reward, according as, the one being a good, the other is a greater good:
inasmuch as also she has this thought only, how to please the Lord. For
it is not that a female who believes, keeping married chastity, thinks
not how to please the Lord; but assuredly less so, in that she thinks of
the things of the world, how to please her husband. For this is what he
would say of them, that they may, in a certain way, find themselves
obliged by marriage to think of the things of the world, how to please
their husbands.
