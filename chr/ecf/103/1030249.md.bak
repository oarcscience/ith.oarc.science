id="iv.ii.i-p1.1"></span>Introductory Notice</span>

<span id="iv.ii.i-p2"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iv.ii.i-p2.1"></span>By the Editor.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iv.ii.i-p3.1"></span>St. Augustin</span> speaks of this book in his
*Retractations*, l. ii. c. 63, as follows:

<span id="iv.ii.i-p4"></span>“I also wrote a book on *Faith, Hope, and
Charity*, at the request of the person to whom I addressed it, that he
might have a work of mine which should never be out of his hands, such
as the Greeks call an *Enchiridion* (*Hand-Book*). There I think I have
pretty carefully treated of the manner in which God is to be worshipped,
which knowledge divine Scripture defines to be the true wisdom of man.
The book begins: ‘I cannot express,’” etc. <span
id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md)

<span id="iv.ii.i-p6"></span>The *Enchiridion* is among the latest books
of Augustin. It was written after the death of Jerome, which occurred
Sept. 30, 420; for he alludes in ch. 87 to Jerome “of blessed memory”
(*sanctæ memoriæ Hieronymus presbyter*).

<span id="iv.ii.i-p7"></span>It is addressed to Laurentius, in answer to
his questions. This person is otherwise unknown. One <span
class="c19"><span id="iv.ii.i-p7.1"></span>ms</span>. calls him a
deacon, another a notary of the city of Rome. He was probably a layman.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p8"></span>The author usually calls the book “On
Faith, Hope and Love,” because he treats the subject under these three
heads (comp. ([1 Cor. 13.13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.ii.i-p8.1"></span>[I Cor. xiii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#013)<span id="iv.ii.i-p8.2"></span>.md). He
follows under the first head the order of the Apostles’ Creed, and
refutes, without naming them, the Manichæan, Apollinarian, Arian, and
Pelagian heresies. Under the second head he gives a brief exposition of
the Lord’s Prayer. The third part is a discourse on Christian love.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p9"></span>The original is in the sixth volume of the
Benedictine edition. A neat edition of the Latin text, with three other
small tracts of Augustin, (*De Catechizandis Rudibus; De Fide Rerum quæ
non creduntur; De Utilitate Credendi*), is also published in C.
Marriott’s *S. Aurelius Augustinus*, 4th ed. by H. de Romestin, Oxford
and London (Parker and Comp.), 1885 (pp. 150–251.) An English edition of
the same tracts by H. de Romestin, Oxford and London, 1885 (pp.
151–251). His English translation is based on that of C. L. Cornish,
M.A., which appeared in the Oxford “Library of the Fathers,” Oxford 1847
(“Seventeen Short Treatises of St. Aug.” pp. 85–158).

<span id="iv.ii.i-p10"></span>The present translation by Professor Shaw
was first published in Dr. Dods’s series of Augustin’s works, Edinburgh,
(T. and T. Clark,) 3d ed. 1883. It is more free and idiomatic than that
of Cornish. I have in a few cases conformed it more closely to the
original.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p11"></span>P.S.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p5"></span> *“Scripsi etiam librum ‘de Fide, Spe et
Charitate’ cum a me ad quem scriptus est postulasset ut aliquod
opusculum haberet meum de suis manibus nunquam recessurum, quod genus
Græci <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.ii.i-p5.1"></span>Enchiridion</span> vocant. Ubi satis diligenter
mihi videor esse complexus quomodo sit colendus Deus quam sapientiam
esse hominis utique veram Divina Scriptura definit. Hic liber sic
incipit, ‘Dici non potest, dilectissime fili Laurenti, quantum tuâ
eruditione delecter.’”*
