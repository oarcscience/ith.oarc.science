of Itself is Deceitful.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xii.vi-p2"></span>8. But the mind errs, when it so
lovingly and intimately connects itself with these images, as even to
consider itself to be something of the same kind. For so it is conformed
to them to some extent, not by being this, but by thinking it is so: not
that it thinks itself to be an image, but outright that very thing
itself of which it entertains the image. For there still lives in it the
power of distinguishing the corporeal thing which it leaves without,
from the image of that corporeal thing which it contains therefrom
within itself: except when these images are so projected as if felt
without and not thought within, as in the case of people who are asleep,
or mad, or in a trance.
