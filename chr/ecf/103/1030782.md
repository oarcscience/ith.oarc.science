<span id="v.viii.viii-p1"></span> 7. Though indeed the welfare even of
the body is then more providently consulted for if its temporal life and
welfare be disregarded for righteousness’ sake, and its pain or death
most patiently for righteousness’ sake endured. Since it is of the
body’s redemption which is to be in the end, that the Apostle speaks,
where he says, “Even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting the
adoption of sons, the redemption of our body.” <span
id="fr_2634"></span>[2635](#fn_2634.md) Then he subjoins, “For in hope are
we saved. But hope which is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why
doth he also hope for? But if what we see not we hope for, we do by
patience wait for it.” When therefore any ills do torture us indeed, yet
not extort from us ill works, not only is the soul possessed through
patience; but even when through patience the body itself for a time is
afflicted or lost, it is unto eternal stability and salvation resumed,
and hath through grief and death an inviolable health and happy
immortality laid up for itself. Whence the Lord Jesus exhorting his
Martyrs to patience, hath promised of the very body a future perfect
entireness, without loss, I say not of any limb, but of a single hair.
“Verily I say unto you,” saith He, “a hair of your head shall not
perish.” <span id="fr_2635"></span>[2636](#fn_2635.md) That so, because, as
the Apostle says, “no man ever hated his own flesh,” <span
id="fr_2636"></span>[2637](#fn_2636.md) a faithful man may more by patience
than by impatience take vigilant care for the state of his flesh, and
find amends for its present losses, how great soever they may be, in the
inestimable gain of future incorruption.
