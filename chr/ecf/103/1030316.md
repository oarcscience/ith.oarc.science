<span id="iv.ii.lxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 66.—The Pardon of Sin Has
Reference Chiefly to the Future Judgment.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxviii-p2"></span>Now the pardon of sin has reference
chiefly to the future judgment. For, as far as this life is concerned,
the saying of Scripture holds good: “A heavy yoke is upon the sons of
Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother’s womb, till the day
that they return to the mother of all things.” <span
id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213.md) So that we see even infants, after
baptism and regeneration, suffering from the infliction of divers evils:
and thus we are given to understand, that all that is set forth in the
sacraments of salvation refers rather to the hope of future good, than
to the retaining or attaining of present blessings. For many sins seem
in this world to be overlooked and visited with no punishment, whose
punishment is reserved for the future (for it is not in vain that the
day when Christ shall come as Judge of quick and dead is peculiarly
named the day of judgment); just as, on the other hand, many sins are
punished in this life, which nevertheless are pardoned, and shall bring
down no punishment in the future life. Accordingly, in reference to
certain temporal punishments, which in this life are visited upon
sinners, the apostle, addressing those whose sins are <span
id="page_259">p. 259</span> <span
id="iv.ii.lxviii-Page_259"></span>blotted out, and not reserved for the
final judgment, says: “For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be
judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
should not be condemned with the world.” <span
