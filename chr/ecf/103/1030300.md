<span id="iv.ii.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 50.—Christ Took Away Not Only the One
Original Sin, But All the Other Sins that Have Been Added to It.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lii-p2"></span>With this difference: the first man
brought one sin into the world, but this man took away not only that one
sin, but all that He found added to it. Hence the apostle says: <span
id="page_254">p. 254</span> <span id="iv.ii.lii-Page_254"></span>“And
not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was
by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses unto
justification.” <span id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173) For it is
evident that the one sin which we bring with us by nature would, even if
it stood alone, bring us under condemnation; but the free gift justifies
man from many offenses: for each man, in addition to the one sin which,
in common with all his kind, he brings with him by nature, has committed
many sins that are strictly his own.
