<span id="iv.i.x.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.x.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—Of True Love, by Which We Arrive
at the Knowledge of the Trinity. God is to Be Sought, Not Outwardly, by
Seeking to Do Wonderful Things with the Angels, But Inwardly, by
Imitating the Piety of Good Angels.</span>

<span id="iv.i.x.viii-p2"></span>10. No other thing, then, is chiefly to
be regarded in this inquiry, which we make concerning the Trinity and
concerning knowing God, except what is true love, nay, rather what is
love. For that is to be called love which is true, otherwise it is
desire; and so those who desire are said improperly to love, just as
they who love are said improperly to desire. But this is true love, that
cleaving to the truth we may live righteously, and so may despise all
mortal things in comparison with the love of men, whereby we wish them
to live righteously. For so we should be prepared also to die profitably
for our brethren, as our Lord Jesus Christ taught us by His example. For
as there are two commandments on which hang all the Law and the
prophets, love of God and love of our neighbor; <span
id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) not without cause the Scripture mostly
puts one for both: whether it be of God only, as is that text, “For we
know that all things work together for good to them that love
God;” <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) and again, “But if any man
love God, the same is known of Him;” <span
id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) and that, “Because the love of God is
shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto
us;” <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md) and many other passages;
because he who loves God must both needs do what God has commanded, and
loves Him just in such proportion as he does so; therefore he must needs
also love his neighbor, because God has commanded it: or whether it be
that Scripture only mentions the love of our neighbor, as in that text,
“Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ;” <span
id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) and again, “For all the law is
fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself;” <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) and in the Gospel,
“All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so
to them; for this is the Law and the prophets.” <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) And many other passages occur in the
sacred writings, in which only the love of our neighbor seems to be
commanded for perfection, while the love of God is passed over in
silence; whereas the Law and the prophets hang on both precepts. But
this, too, is because he who loves his neighbor must needs also love
above all else love itself. But “God is love; and he that dwelleth in
love, dwelleth in God.” <span id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md)
Therefore he must needs above all else love God.

<span id="iv.i.x.viii-p11"></span>11. Wherefore they who seek God
through those Powers which rule over the world, or parts of the world,
are removed and cast away far from Him; not by intervals of space, but
by difference of affections: for they endeavor to find a path outwardly,
and forsake their own inward things, within which is God. Therefore,
even although they may either have heard some holy heavenly Power, or in
some way or another may have thought of it, yet they rather covet its
deeds at which human weakness marvels, but do not imitate the piety by
which divine rest is acquired. For they prefer, through pride, to be
able to do that which an angel does, more than, through devotion, to be
that which an angel is. For no holy being rejoices in his own power, but
in His from whom he has the power which he fitly can have; and he knows
it to be more a mark of power to be united to the Omnipotent by a pious
will, than to be able, by his own power and will, to do what they may
tremble at who are not able to do such things. Therefore the Lord Jesus
Christ Himself, in doing such things, in order that He might teach
better things to those who marvelled at them, and might turn those who
were intent and in doubt about unusual temporal things to eternal and
inner things, says, “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you.” And He does not
say, Learn of me, because I raise those <span id="page_123">p.
123</span> <span id="iv.i.x.viii-Page_123"></span>who have been dead
four days; but He says, “Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.”
For humility, which is most solid, is more powerful and safer than
pride, that is most inflated. And so He goes on to say, “And ye shall
find rest unto your souls,” <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) for
“Love <span id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) is not puffed up;” <span
id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) and “God is Love;” <span
id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) and “such as be faithful in love shall
rest in <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) Him,” <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) called back from the din which is
without to silent joys. Behold, “God is Love:” why do we go forth and
run to the heights of the heavens and the lowest parts of the earth,
seeking Him who is within us, if we wish to be with Him?
