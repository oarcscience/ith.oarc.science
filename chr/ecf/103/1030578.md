<span id="v.iii.xxv-p1"></span> 24. But concerning what eunuchs speaketh
<span id="page_425">p. 425</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxv-Page_425"></span>God by the prophet Isaiah, unto whom He
saith that He will give in His house and in His wall a place by name,
much better than of sons and daughters, <span
id="fr_2066"></span>[2067](#fn_2066) save concerning these, who make
themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven? For for these,
whose bodily organ is without strength, so that they cannot beget, (such
as are the eunuchs of rich men and of kings,) it is surely enough, when
they become Christians, and keep the commands of God, yet have this
purpose, that, if they could, they would have wives, to be made equal to
the rest of the faithful in the house of God, who are married, who bring
up in the fear of God a family which they have lawfully and chastely
gotten, teaching their sons to set their hope on God; but not to receive
a *better* place than of sons and daughters. For it is not of virtue of
the soul, but of necessity of the flesh, that they marry not wives. Let
who will contend that the Prophet foretold this of those eunuchs who
have suffered mutilation of body; that even also helps the cause which
we have undertaken. For God hath not preferred these eunuchs to such as
have no place in His house, but assuredly to those who keep the desert
of married life in begetting sons. For, when He saith, “I will give unto
them a place much better;” He shows that one is also given unto the
married, but much inferior. Therefore, to allow that in the house of God
there will be the eunuchs after the flesh spoken of above, who were not
in the People of Israel: because we see that these also themselves,
whereas they become not Jews, yet become Christians: and that the
Prophet spake not of them, who through purpose of continence seeking not
marriage, make themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven:
is any one so madly opposed to the truth as to believe that eunuchs made
so in the flesh have a better place than married persons in the house of
God, and to contend that persons being of pious purpose continent,
chastening the body even unto contempt of marriage, making themselves
eunuchs, not in the body, but in the very root of concupiscence,
practising an heavenly and angelic life in an earthly mortal state, are
on a level with the deserts of the married; and, being a Christian, to
gainsay Christ when He praises those who have made themselves eunuchs,
not for the sake of this world, but for the sake of the kingdom of
heaven, affirming that this is of use for the present life, not for a
future? What else remains for these, save to assert that the kingdom of
heaven itself pertains unto this temporal life, wherein we now are? For
why should not blind presumption advance even to this madness? And what
more full of phrensy than this assertion? For, although at times the
Church, even that which is at this time, is called the kingdom of
heaven; certainly it is so called for this end, because it is being
gathered together for a future and eternal life. Although, therefore, it
have the promise of the present, and of a future life, yet in all its
good works it looks not to “the things that are seen, but to what are
not seen. For what are seen are temporal; but what are not seen, are
eternal.” <span id="fr_2067"></span>[2068](#fn_2067)
