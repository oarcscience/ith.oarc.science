<span id="iv.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—The Fear of God is Man’s True
Wisdom.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p2"></span>The true wisdom of man is piety. You find
this in the book of holy Job. For we read there what wisdom itself has
said to man: “Behold, the fear of the Lord \[*pietas*\], that is
wisdom.” <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092) If you ask further
what is meant in that place by *pietas*, the Greek calls it more
definitely <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.iv-p3.2"></span>θεοσέβεια</span>, that is, the worship of God.
The Greeks sometimes call piety <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.iv-p3.3"></span>εὐσέβεια</span>, which signifies right
worship, though this, of course, refers specially to the worship of God.
But when we are defining <span id="page_238">p. 238</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv-Page_238"></span>in what man’s true wisdom consists, the
most convenient word to use is that which distinctly expresses the fear
of God. And can you, who are anxious that I should treat of great
matters in few words, wish for a briefer form of expression? Or perhaps
you are anxious that this expression should itself be briefly explained,
and that I should unfold in a short discourse the proper mode of
worshipping God?
