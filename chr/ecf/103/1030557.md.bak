<span id="v.iii.iv-p1"></span> 3. It is written in the Gospel, of the
mother and brethren of Christ, that is, His kindred after the flesh,
that, when word had been brought to Him, and they were standing without,
because they could not come to Him by reason of the crowd, He made
answer, “Who is My mother? or who are My brethren? and stretching forth
His Hand over His disciples, He saith, These are My brethren: and
whosoever shall have done the will of My Father, that man is to Me
brother, and mother, and sister.” <span
id="fr_2028"></span>[2029](#fn_2028.md) What else teaching us, than to
prefer to kindred after the flesh, our descent after the Spirit: and
that men are not blessed for this reason, that they are united by
nearness of flesh unto just and holy men, but that, by obeying and
following, they cleave unto their doctrine and conduct. Therefore Mary
is more blessed in receiving the faith of Christ, than in conceiving the
flesh of Christ. For to a certain one who said, “Blessed is the womb,
which bare Thee,” <span id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029.md) He Himself
made answer, “Yea, rather, blessed are they who hear the Word of God,
and keep it.” Lastly, to His brethren, that is, His kindred after the
flesh, who believed not in Him, what profit was there in that being of
kin? Thus also her nearness as a Mother would have been of no profit to
Mary, had she not borne Christ in her heart after a more blessed manner
than in her flesh.
