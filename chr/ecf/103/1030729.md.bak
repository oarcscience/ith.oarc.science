<span id="v.vi.xli"></span>

<span id="v.vi.xli-p1"></span> 40. But sometimes a peril to eternal
salvation itself is put forth against us; <span
id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465.md) which peril, they cry out, we by
telling a lie, if otherwise it cannot be, must ward off. As, for
instance, if a person who is to be baptized be in the power of impious
and infidel men, and cannot be got at that he may be washed with the
laver of regeneration, but by deceiving his keepers with a lie. From
this most invidious cry, by which we are compelled, not for a man’s
wealth or honors in this world which are fleeting by, not for the life
itself of this present time, but for the eternal salvation of a human
being, to tell a lie, whither shall I betake me for refuge but unto
thee, O truth? And by thee is put forth before me, <span
id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466.md) Chastity. For why, if those keepers
may be enticed to admit us to baptize the man, by our committing
lewdness, do we refuse to do things contrary to chastity, and yet, if by
a lie they may be deceived, consent to do things contrary to truth? when
without doubt no man would faithfully think chastity amiable, but
because it is enjoined of truth? So then, to get at a man to baptize
him, let the keepers be deceived by lying, if truth bid it. But how can
truth bid in order that a man may be baptized, that we should tell a
lie, if chastity biddeth not, in order that a man be baptized, that we
should commit whoredom? Now <span id="page_500">p. 500</span> <span
id="v.vi.xli-Page_500"></span>why doth chastity not bid this, but
because this truth teacheth not? If then, save what truth teacheth, we
ought not to do, when truth teacheth not even for the sake of baptizing
a man to do what is contrary to chastity, how shall she teach us to do
for the sake of baptizing a man what is contrary to herself, the truth?
But like as eyes not strong enough to look upon the sun yet do gladly
look upon the objects which are by the sun enlightened, so, souls which
have already strength to delight in the beauty of chastity are yet not
straightway able to consider in her very self that truth whence charity
hath her light, insomuch that when it cometh to the doing of somewhat
that is adverse to truth, they should so start back in horror as they do
start back in horror if aught be proposed to be done that is adverse to
chastity. But that son, who, receiving the word shall be far from
perdition, and nothing false cometh forth of his mouth, <span
id="fr_2467"></span>[2468](#fn_2467.md) accounts it as much debarred from
him if, to the succoring of his fellow man he be urged to pass through a
lie, as if it were through the deed of lewdness. And the Father heareth
and granteth his prayer that he may avail without a lie to succor whom
the Father Himself, Whose judgments are unsearchable, willeth to be
succored. Such a son therefore so keeps watch against a lie, as he doth
against sin. For indeed sometimes the name of lie is put for the name of
sin: whence is that saying, “All men are liars.” <span
id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468.md) For it is so said, as if it were
said, “All men are sinners.” And that: “But if the truth of God hath
abounded through my lie.” <span id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469.md) And
therefore, when he lies as a man he sins as a man, and will be held by
that sentence in which it is said, “All men are liars;” and, “If we say
that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
us.” <span id="fr_2470"></span>[2471](#fn_2470.md) But when nothing false
cometh forth of his mouth, according to that grace will it so be, of
which is said: “He that is born of God, sinneth not.” <span
id="fr_2471"></span>[2472](#fn_2471.md) For were this nativity by itself
alone in us, no man would sin: and when it shall be alone, no man will
sin. But now, we as yet drag on that which we were born corruptible:
although, according to that which we are new-born, if we walk aright,
from day to day we are renewed inwardly. <span
id="fr_2472"></span>[2473](#fn_2472.md) But when this corruptible shall
have put on incorruption, life will swallow it up wholly, and not a
sting of death will remain. <span id="fr_2473"></span>[2474](#fn_2473.md)
Now this sting of death is sin.
