<span id="v.iii.xxxv-p1"></span> 34. Paul the Apostle censures evil
unmarried women, curious and prating, and says that this fault comes of
idleness. “But at the same time,” saith he, “being idle they learn to go
about to houses: but not only idle, but curious also and prating,
speaking what they ought not.” <span
id="fr_2116"></span>[2117](#fn_2116.md) Of these he had said above, “But
younger widows avoid; for when they have past their time in delights,
they wish to wed in Christ; having condemnation, in that they have made
void their first faith:” that is, have not continued in that, which they
had vowed at the first. And yet he saith not, they marry, but “they wish
to marry.” For many of them are recalled from marrying, not by love of a
noble purpose, but by fear of open shame, which also itself comes of
pride, whereby persons fear to displease men more than God. These,
therefore, who wish to marry, and do not marry on this account, because
they cannot with impunity, who would do better to marry than to be
burned, that is, than to be laid waste in their very conscience by the
hidden flame of lust, who repent of their profession, and who feel their
confession irksome; unless they correct and set right their heart, and
by the fear of God again overcome their lust, must be accounted among
the dead; whether they pass their time in delights, whence the Apostle
says, “But she who passes her time in delights, living, is dead;” <span
id="fr_2117"></span>[2118](#fn_2117.md) or whether in labors and fastings,
which are useless where there is no correction of the heart, and serve
rather for display than amendment. I do not, for my part, impose on such
a great regard for humility, in whom pride itself is confounded, and
bloodstained by wound of conscience. Nor on such as are drunken, or
covetous, or who are lying in any other kind whatever of damnable
disease, at the same time that they have profession of bodily
continence, and through perverse manners are at variance with their own
name, do I impose this great anxiety about pious humility: unless haply
in these evils they shall dare even to make a display of themselves,
unto whom it is not enough, that the punishments of these are deferred.
Nor am I treating of these, in whom there is a certain aim of pleasing,
either by more elegant dress than the necessity of so great profession
demands, or by remarkable manner of binding the head, whether by bosses
of hair swelling forth, or by coverings so yielding, that the fine
network below appears: unto these we must give precepts, not as yet
concerning humility, but concerning chastity itself, or virgin modesty.
Give me one who makes profession of perpetual continence, and who is
free from these, and all such faults and spots of conduct; for this one
I fear pride, for this so great good I am in alarm from the swelling of
arrogance. The more there is in any one on account of which to be
self-pleased, the more I fear, lest, by pleasing self, he please not
Him, Who “resisteth the proud, but unto the humble giveth grace.” <span
