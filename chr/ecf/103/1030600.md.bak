<span id="v.iii.xlvii"></span>

<span id="v.iii.xlvii-p1"></span> 46. But this is so great, that certain
understand it to be the fruit an hundred-fold. <span
id="fr_2189"></span>[2190](#fn_2189.md) For the authority of the Church
bears a very conspicuous witness, in which it is known to the faithful
in what place the Martyrs, in what place the holy nuns deceased, are
rehearsed at the Sacraments of the Altar. <span
id="fr_2190"></span>[2191](#fn_2190.md) But what the meaning is of that
difference of fruitfulness, let them see to it, who understand these
things better than we; whether the virginal life be in fruit an
hundred-fold, in sixty-fold the widowed, in thirty-fold the married; or
whether the hundred-fold fruitfulness be ascribed unto martyrdom, the
sixty-fold unto continence, the thirty-fold unto marriage; or whether
virginity, by the addition of martyrdom, fill up the hundred-fold, but
when alone be in sixty-fold, but married persons bearing thirty-fold
arrive at sixty-fold, in case they shall be martyrs: or whether, what
seems to me more probable, forasmuch as the gifts of Divine grace are
many, and one is greater and better than another, whence the Apostle
says, “But emulate ye the better gifts;” <span
id="fr_2191"></span>[2192](#fn_2191.md) we are to understand that they are
more in number than to allow of being distributed under those different
kinds. In the first place, that we set not widowed continence either as
bearing no fruit, or set it but level with the desert of married
charity, or equal it unto virgin glory; or think that the Crown of
Martyrdom, either established in habit of mind, although proof of trial
be wanting, or in actual making trial of suffering, be added unto either
one of those these chastities, without any increase of fruitfulness.
Next, when we set it down that many men and women so keep virginal
chastity, as that yet they do not the things which the Lord saith, “If
thou willest to be perfect, go, sell all that thou hast, and give unto
the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven: and come, follow
me;” <span id="fr_2192"></span>[2193](#fn_2192.md) and dare not unite
themselves to those dwelling together, among whom no one saith that any
thing is his own, but all things are unto them common; <span
id="fr_2193"></span>[2194](#fn_2193.md) do we think that there is no
addition of fruitfulness unto the virgins of God, when they do this? or
that the virgins of God are without any fruit, although they do not
this? Therefore there are many gifts, and some brighter and higher than
others, each than each. And at times one is fruitful in fewer gifts, but
better; another in lower gifts, but more. And in what manner they be
either made equal one to another, or distinguished one from another, in
receiving eternal honors, who of men would dare to pronounce? whereas
yet it is plain both that those differences are many, and that the
better are profitable not for the present time, but for eternity. But I
judge that the Lord willed to make mention of three differences <span
id="page_435">p. 435</span> <span id="v.iii.xlvii-Page_435"></span>of
fruitfulness, the rest He left to such as understand. <span
id="fr_2194"></span>[2195](#fn_2194.md) For also another Evangelist hath
made mention only of the hundred-fold: <span
id="fr_2195"></span>[2196](#fn_2195.md) we are not, therefore, are we, to
think that he either rejected, or knew not of, the other two, but rather
that he left them to be understood?
