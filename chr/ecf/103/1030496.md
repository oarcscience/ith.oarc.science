<span id="v.i.xiii-p1"></span> 13. In this so great conflict, wherein
man under Grace lives, and when, being aided, he fights well, rejoices
in the Lord with trembling, there yet are not wanting even to valiant
warriors, and mortifiers however unconquered of the works of the flesh,
some wounds of sins, for the healing of which they may say daily,
“Forgive us our debts:” <span id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854)
against the same vices, and against the devil the prince and king of
vices, striving with much greater watchfulness and keenness by the very
prayer, that his deadly suggestions avail not aught, whereby he further
urges the sinner to excuse rather than accuse his own sins; and thus
those wounds not only be not healed, but also, although they were not
deadly, yet may be pressed home to grievous and fatal harm. And here
therefore there is need of a more cautious Continence, whereby to
restrain the proud appetite of man; whereby he is self-pleased, and
unwilling to be found worthy of blame, and disdains, when he sins, to be
convicted that he himself has sinned; not with healthful humility taking
upon him to accuse himself, but rather with fatal arrogance seeking to
find an excuse. In order to restrain this pride, he, whose words I have
already set down above, and, as I could, commended, sought Continence
from the Lord. For, after that he had said, “Set, O Lord, a watch to my
mouth, and a door of Continence around my lips. Make not my heart to
fall aside unto evil words;” <span id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855)
explaining more clearly whereof he spake this, he saith, “to make
excuses in sins.” For what more evil than these words, whereby the evil
man denies that he is evil, although convicted of an evil work, which he
cannot deny. And since he cannot hide the deed, or say that it is well
done, and still sees that it is clear that it was done by him, he seeks
to refer to another what he hath done, as though he could remove thence
what he hath deserved. Being unwilling that himself be guilty, he rather
adds to his guilt, and by excusing, not accusing, his own sins, he knows
not that he is putting from him, not punishment, but pardon. For before
human judges, forasmuch as they may be deceived, it seems to profit
somewhat for the time, to cleanse as it were what hath been done amiss
by any deceit whatever; but before God, Who cannot be deceived, we are
to use, not a deceitful defense, but a true confession of sins.
