<span id="v.vi.xxxvii-p1"></span> 36. But for that we are men and among
men do live, and I confess that I am not yet in the number of them whom
compensative sins embarrass not, it oft befalleth me in human affairs to
be overcome by human feeling, nor am I able to resist when it is said to
me, “Lo, here is a sick man in peril of his life with a grievous
disease, whose strength will no more be able to bear it, if the death of
his only and most dear son be announced to him; he asks of thee whether
his son liveth, and thou knowest that he is departed this <span
id="page_498">p. 498</span> <span id="v.vi.xxxvii-Page_498"></span>life;
what wilt thou reply, when, whatever thou shall say beside one of these
three; either, He is dead; or, He liveth; or, I know not; he believes no
other than that he is dead; which thing he perceives thee to be afraid
to tell, and unwilling to tell a lie?” It comes to the same thing, if
thou altogether hold thy peace. But of those three, two are false, He
liveth, and, I know not; and they cannot be said by thee but by telling
a lie. Whereas if thou shall say that one thing which is true, that is,
that he is dead, and the man be so perturbed that death follow, people
will cry out that thou hast killed him. And who can bear men casting up
to him what a mischief it is to shun a lie that might save life, and to
choose truth which murders a man? I am moved by these objections
exceedingly, but it were marvelous whether also wisely. For, when I
shall set before the eyes of my heart (such as they be) the
intellectual <span id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) beauty of Him
out of Whose mouth nothing false proceedeth, albeit where truth in her
radiance doth more and more brighten upon me, there my weak and
throbbing sense is beaten back: yet I am with love of that surpassing
comeliness so set on fire, that I despise all human regards which would
thence recall me. But it is much that this affection persevere to that
degree, that in temptation it lack not its effect. Nor doth it move me
while contemplating that luminous Good in which is no darkness of a lie,
that, when we refuse to lie, and men through hearing of a truth do die,
truth is called a murderer. For if a lewd woman crave of thee the
gratification of her lust, and, when thou consentest not, she perturbed
with the fierceness of her love should die, will chastity also be a
murderer? Or, truly, because we read, “We are a sweet savor of Christ in
every place, both in them which are saved and in them which
perish;” <span id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md) to the one, indeed,
a savor of life unto life, to others a savor of death unto death; shall
we pronounce even the savor of Christ to be a murderer? But, for that
we, being men, are in questions and contradictions of this sort for the
most part overcome or wearied out by our feeling as men, for that very
reason hath the Apostle also presently subjoined, “And who is sufficient
for these things?”
