<span id="iv.vii.x"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.x-p1"></span> 10. Scripture saith, “Ye have heard of
the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779.md) When we read what great trials Job
endured, it makes one shudder, it makes one shrink, it makes one quake.
And what did he receive? The double of what he had lost. Let not a man
therefore with an eye to temporal rewards be willing to have patience,
and say to himself, “Let me endure loss, God will give me back sons
twice as many; Job received double of all, and begat as many sons as he
had buried.” Then is this not the double? Yes, precisely the double,
because the former sons still lived. Let none say, “Let me bear evils,
and God will repay me as He repaid Job:” that it be now no longer
patience but avarice. For if it was not patience which that Saint had,
nor a brave enduring of all that came upon him; the testimony which the
Lord gave, whence should he have it? “Hast thou observed,” saith the
Lord, “my servant Job? For there is not like him any on the earth, a man
without fault, <span id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780.md) true
worshipper of God.” What a testimony, my brethren, did this holy man
deserve of the Lord! And yet him a bad woman sought by her persuasion to
deceive, she too representing that serpent, who, like as in Paradise he
deceived the man whom God first made, so likewise here by suggesting
blasphemy thought to be able to deceive a man who pleased God. What
things he suffered, my brethren! Who can have so much to suffer in his
estate, his house, his sons, his flesh, yea in his very wife who was
left to be his tempter! But even her who was left, the devil would have
taken away long ago, but that he kept her to be his helper: because by
Eve he had mastered the first man, therefore had he kept an Eve. What
things, then, he suffered! He lost all that he had; his house fell;
would that were all! it crushed his sons also. And, to see that patience
had great place in him, hear what he answered; “The Lord gave, the Lord
hath taken away; as it pleased the Lord, so hath it been done; <span
id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781.md) blessed be the name of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782.md) He hath taken what He
gave, is He lost Who gave? He hath taken what He gave. As if he should
say, He hath taken away all, let Him take all, send me away naked, and
let me keep Him. What shall I lack if I have God? or what is the good of
all else to me, if I have not God? Then it came to his flesh, he was
stricken with a wound from head to foot; he was one running sore, one
mass of crawling worms: and showed himself immovable in his God, stood
fixed. The woman wanted, devil’s helper as she was not husband’s
comforter, to put him up to blaspheme God. “How long,” said she, “dost
thou suffer” so and so; “speak some word against the Lord, <span
id="fr_1783"></span>[1784](#fn_1783.md) and die.” <span
id="fr_1784"></span>[1785](#fn_1784.md) So then, because he had been
brought low, he was to be exalted. And this the Lord did, in order to
show it to men; as for His servant, He kept greater things for him in
heaven. So then Job who was brought low, He exalted; the devil who was
lifted up, He brought low: <span id="page_373">p. 373</span> <span
id="iv.vii.x-Page_373"></span>for “He putteth down one and setteth up
another.” <span id="fr_1785"></span>[1786](#fn_1785.md) But let not any
man, my beloved brethren, when he suffers any such-like tribulations,
look for a reward here: for instance, if he suffer any losses, let him
not peradventure say, “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as it
pleased the Lord, so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord;” only
with the mind to receive twice as much again. Let patience praise God,
not avarice. If what thou hast lost thou seekest to receive back
twofold, and therefore praisest God, it is of covetousness thou
praisest, not of love. Do not imagine this to be the example of that
holy man; thou deceivest thyself. When Job was enduring all, he was not
hoping for to have twice as much again. Both in his first confession
when he bore up under his losses, and bore out to the grave the dead
bodies of his sons, and in the second when he was now suffering torments
of sores in his flesh, ye may observe what I am saying. Of his former
confession the words run thus: “The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken
away: as it pleased the Lord, so is it done: blessed be the name of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1786"></span>[1787](#fn_1786.md) He might have said,
“The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; He that took away can once
more give; can bring back more than He took.” He said not this, but, “As
it pleased the Lord,” said he, “so is it done:” because it pleases Him,
let it please me: let not that which hath pleased the good Lord
misplease His submissive servant; what pleased the Physician, not
misplease the sick man. Hear his other confession: “Thou hast spoken,”
said he to his wife, “like one of the foolish women. If we have received
good at the hand of the Lord, why shall we not bear evil?” <span
id="fr_1787"></span>[1788](#fn_1787.md) He did not add, what, if he had
said it, would have been true. “The Lord is able both to bring back my
flesh into its former condition, and that which He hath taken away from
us, to make manifold more:” lest he should seem to have endured in hope
of this. This was not what he said, not what he hoped. But, that we
might be taught, did the Lord that for him, not hoping for it, by which
we should be taught, that God was with him: because if He had not also
restored to him those things, there was the crown indeed, but hidden,
and we could not see it. And therefore what says the divine Scripture in
exhorting to patience and hope of things future, not reward of things
present? “Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of
the Lord.” Why is it, “the patience of Job,” and not, Ye have seen the
end of Job himself? Thou wouldest open thy mouth for the “twice as
much;” wouldest say, “Thanks be to God; let me bear up: I receive twice
as much again, like Job.” “Patience of Job, end of the Lord.” The
patience of Job we know, and the end of the Lord we know. <span
id="fr_1788"></span>[1789](#fn_1788.md) What end of the Lord? “My God, my
God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” They are the words of the Lord hanging
on the cross. He did as it were leave Him for present felicity, not
leave Him for eternal immortality. In this is “the end of the Lord.” The
Jews hold Him, the Jews insult, the Jews bind Him, crown Him with
thorns, dishonor Him with spitting, scourge Him, overwhelm Him with
revilings, hang Him upon the tree, pierce Him with a spear, last of all
bury Him. He was as it were left: but by whom? By those insulting ones.
Therefore thou shall but to this end have patience, that thou mayest
rise again and not die, that is, never die, even as Christ. For so we
read, “Christ rising from the dead henceforth dieth not.” <span
