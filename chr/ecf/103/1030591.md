<span id="v.iii.xxxviii-p1"></span> 37. But regard the troops of
virgins, holy boys and girls: this kind hath been trained up in Thy
Church: there for Thee it hath been budding from its mother’s breasts;
for Thy Name it hath loosed its tongue to speak, Thy Name, as through
the milk of its infancy, it hath had poured in and hath sucked, no one
of this number can say, “I, who before was a blasphemer, and persecutor,
and injurious, but I obtained mercy, in that I did in being ignorant, in
unbelief.” <span id="fr_2129"></span>[2130](#fn_2129) Yea more, that,
which Thou commandedst not, but only didst set forth, for such as would,
to seize, saying, “Whoso can receive, let him receive;” they have
seized, they have vowed, and, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, not
for that Thou threatenedst, but for that Thou exhortedst, they have made
themselves eunuchs. <span id="fr_2130"></span>[2131](#fn_2130) To these
cry out, let these hear Thee, in that Thou art “meek and lowly of
heart.” Let these, by how much they are great, by so much humble
themselves in all things, that they may find grace before Thee. They are
just: but they are not, are they, such as Thou, justifying the ungodly?
They are chaste: but them in sins their mothers nurtured in their
wombs. <span id="fr_2131"></span>[2132](#fn_2131) They are holy, but
Thou art also Holy of Holies. They are virgins, but they are not also
born of virgins. They are wholly chaste both in spirit and in flesh: but
they are not the Word made flesh. <span
id="fr_2132"></span>[2133](#fn_2132) And yet let them learn, not from
those unto whom Thou forgivest sins, but from Thee Thyself, The Lamb of
God Who takest away the sins of the world, <span
id="fr_2133"></span>[2134](#fn_2133) in that Thou art “meek and lowly of
heart.”
