<span id="v.ix.xxiii-p1"></span> 22. Which things being so, let us not
think that to the dead for whom we have a care, any thing reaches save
what by sacrifices either of the altar, or of prayers, or of alms, we
solemnly supplicate: although not to all for whom they are done be they
profitable, but to them only by whom while they live it is obtained that
they should be profitable. But forasmuch as we discern not who these be,
it is meet to do them for all regenerate persons, that none of them may
be passed by to whom these benefits may and ought to reach. For better
it is that these things shall be superfluously done to them whom they
neither hinder nor help, than lacking to them whom they help. More
diligently however doth each man these things for his own near and dear
friends, in order that they may be likewise done unto him by his. But as
for the burying of the body, whatever is bestowed on that, is no aid of
salvation, but an office of humanity, according to that affection by
which “no man ever hateth his own flesh.” <span
id="fr_2774"></span>[2775](#fn_2774.md) Whence it is fitting that he
take <span id="fr_2775"></span>[2776](#fn_2775.md) what care he is able for
the flesh of his neighbor, when he is gone that bare <span
id="fr_2776"></span>[2777](#fn_2776.md) it. And if they do these things who
believe not the resurrection of the flesh, how much more are they
beholden to do the same who do believe; that so, an office of this kind
bestowed upon a body, dead but yet to rise again and to remain to
eternity, may also be in some sort a testimony of the same faith? But,
that a person is buried at the memorials of the Martyrs, this, I think,
so far profits the departed, that while commending him also to the
Martyrs’ patronage, the affection of supplication on his behalf is
increased.
