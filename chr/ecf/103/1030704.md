<span id="v.vi.xvi-p1"></span><span id="page_487">p. 487</span> <span
id="v.vi.xvi-Page_487"></span> &gt;15. And as for that saying of the
Apostle, “Putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor,
for we are members one of another,” <span
id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401.md) far be it that we should so
understand it, as though he had permitted to speak a lie with those who
are not yet with us members of the body of Christ. But the reason why it
is said, is, because each one of us ought to account every man to be
that which he wishes him to become, although he be not yet become such;
as the Lord showed the alien Samaritan to be neighbor to him unto whom
he showed mercy.” <span id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402.md) A neighbor
then, and not an alien, is that man to be accounted, with whom our
concern is that he remain not an alien; and if on the score of his not
being yet made partaker of our Faith and Sacrament, there be some truths
that must be concealed from him, yet is that no reason why false things
should be told him.
