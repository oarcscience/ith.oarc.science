<span id="iv.ii.lxxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lxxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 80.—Sins, However Great and
Detestable, Seem Trivial When We are Accustomed to Them.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxxii-p2"></span>Add to this, that sins, however great
and detestable they may be, are looked upon as trivial, or as not sins
at all, when men get accustomed to them; and so far does this go, that
such sins are not only not concealed, but are boasted of, and published
far and wide; and thus, as it is written, “The wicked boasteth of his
heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord
abhorreth.” <span id="fr_1259"></span>[1260](#fn_1259.md) Iniquity of this
kind is in Scripture called a *cry*. You have an instance in the prophet
Isaiah, in the case of the evil vineyard: “He looked <span
id="page_264">p. 264</span> <span id="iv.ii.lxxxii-Page_264"></span>for
judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a
cry.” <span id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260.md) Whence also the
expression in Genesis: “The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,” <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261.md) because in these cities crimes were
not only not punished, but were openly committed, as if under the
protection of the law. And so in our own times: many forms of sin,
though not just the sameas those of Sodom and Gomorrah, are now so
openly and habitually practised, that not only dare we not excommunicate
a layman, we dare not even degrade a clergyman, for the commission of
them. So that when, a few years ago, I was expounding the Epistle to the
Galatians, in commenting on that very place where the apostle says, “I
am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed labor upon you in vain,” I was
compelled to exclaim, “Woe to the sins of men! for it is only when we
are not accustomed to them that we shrink from them: when once we are
accustomed to them, though the blood of the Son of God was poured out to
wash them away, though they are so great that the kingdom of God is
wholly shut against them, constant familiarity leads to the toleration
of them all, and habitual toleration leads to the practice of many of
them. And grant, O Lord, that we may not come to practise all that we
have not the power to hinder.” But I shall see whether the extravagance
of grief did not betray me into rashness of speech.
