<span id="iv.ii.ci-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.ci-p1.1"></span>Chapter 99.—As God’s Mercy is Free, So His
Judgments are Just, and Cannot Be Gainsaid.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.ci-p2"></span>Now after commending the mercy of God,
saying, “So it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but
of God that showeth mercy,” that he might commend His justice also (for
the man who does not obtain mercy finds, not iniquity, but justice,
there being no iniquity with God), he immediately adds: <span
id="page_269">p. 269</span> <span id="iv.ii.ci-Page_269"></span>“For the
scripture saith unto Pharoah, Even for this same purpose have I raised
thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be
declared throughout all the earth.” <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md) And then he draws a conclusion that
applies to both, that is, both to His mercy and His justice: “Therefore
hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He
hardeneth.” <span id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md) “He hath mercy”
of His great goodness, “He hardeneth” without any injustice; so that
neither can he that is pardoned glory in any merit of his own, nor he
that is condemned complain of anything but his own demerit. For it is
grace alone that separates the redeemed from the lost, all having been
involved in one common perdition through their common origin. Now if any
one, on hearing this, should say, “Why doth He yet find fault? for who
hath resisted His will?” <span id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287.md) as
if a man ought not to be blamed for being bad, because God hath mercy on
whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth, God forbid that
we should be ashamed to answer as we see the apostle answered: “Nay,
but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing
formed say to Him that formed it, Why hast Thou made me thus? Hath not
the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto
honor, and another unto dishonor?” <span
id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288.md) Now some foolish people, think that
in this place the apostle had no answer to give; and for want of a
reason to render, rebuked the presumption of his interrogator. But there
is great weight in this saying: “Nay, but, O man, who art thou?” and in
such a matter as this it suggests to a man in a single word the limits
of his capacity, and at the same time does in reality convey an
important reason. For if a man does not understand these matters, who is
he that he should reply against God? And if he does understand them, he
finds no further room for reply. For then he perceives that the whole
human race was condemned in its rebellious head by a divine judgment so
just, that if not a single member of the race had been redeemed, no one
could justly have questioned the justice of God; and that it was right
that those who are redeemed should be redeemed in such a way as to show,
by the greater number who are unredeemed and left in their just
condemnation, what the whole race deserved, and whither the deserved
judgment of God would lead even the redeemed, did not His undeserved
mercy interpose, so that every mouth might be stopped of those who wish
to glory in their own merits, and that he that glorieth might glory in
the Lord. <span id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289.md)
