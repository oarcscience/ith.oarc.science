<span id="v.i.ix-p1"></span> 9. And also, when he exhorts us, that we
live not after the flesh, lest we die, but that by the Spirit we mortify
the deeds of the flesh, that we may live; surely the trumpet which
sounds, shows the war in which we are engaged, and enkindles us to
contend keenly, and to do our enemies to death, <span
id="fr_1831"></span>[1832](#fn_1831) that we be not done to death by
them. But who those enemies are, it hath set forth plainly enough. For
those are they, whom it willed should be done to death by us, that is to
say, the works of the flesh. For so it saith, “But if by the Spirit ye
shall mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.” And in order that
we may know what these are, let us hear the same in like manner writing
unto the Galatians, and saying, “But the works of the flesh are
manifest, which are, fornications, uncleannesses, luxuries, idolatry,
witchcrafts, hatreds, contentions, emulations, wraths, strifes,
heresies, envyings, drunkennesses, revellings, and such like; of which I
foretell to you, as I have foretold, that they who do such things shall
not possess the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_1832"></span>[1833](#fn_1832) For the very war there also was he
showing, that he should speak of these, and unto the death-doing of
these enemies was he calling up the soldiers of Christ by the same
heavenly and spiritual trumpet. For he had said above, “But I say, walk
in the Spirit, and perform ye not the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh
lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. For these
are opposed one to the other, that ye do not what ye would. But if ye
are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law.” <span
id="fr_1833"></span>[1834](#fn_1833) Therefore being set under Grace, he
would have them have that conflict against the works of the flesh. And
in order to point out these works of the flesh, he added what I have
mentioned above. “But the works of the flesh are manifest, which are,
fornications,” and the rest, whether what he mentioned, or whether what
he admonished were to be understood, chiefly as he added, “and such
like.” Lastly, in this battle, against what is in a manner the carnal
army leading forth as it were another spiritual line, “But the fruit of
the Spirit is,” saith he, “charity, joy, peace, long-suffering,
kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, continence; against such there is
no law.” <span id="fr_1834"></span>[1835](#fn_1834) He saith not
“against <span id="page_383">p. 383</span> <span
id="v.i.ix-Page_383"></span>these,” lest they should be thought to be
alone: although even were he to say this, we ought to understand all,
whatever goods of the same kind we could think of: but he saith,
“against such,” that is to say, both these and whatsoever are such like.
However, in that among the goods of which he made mention, he set
Continence in the last <span id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835) place,
(concerning which we have now undertaken to treat, and on account of
which we have already said much,) he willed that it should in an
especial manner cleave to our minds. Forsooth this same is of great
avail in this case, wherein the Spirit lusteth against the flesh;
forasmuch as in a certain way it crucifies the lusts of the flesh.
Whence, after the Apostle had thus spoken, he added straightway, “But
they who are Jesus Christ’s have crucified their own flesh, with the
passions and lusts.” <span id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836) This is
the acting of Continence: thus the works of the flesh are done to death.
But they do to death those, whom falling away from Continence lust
draweth into consent to do such works.
