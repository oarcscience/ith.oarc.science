by Degrees.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xiv.x-p2"></span>15. When the soul then consults either
for itself or for others with a good will towards perceiving the inner
and higher things, such as are possessed in a chaste embrace, without
any narrowness or envy, not individually, but in common by all who love
such things; then even if it be deceived in anything, through ignorance
of things temporal (for its action in this case is a temporal one), and
if it does not hold fast to that mode of acting which it ought, the
temptation is but one common to man. And it is a great thing so to pass
through this life, on which we travel, as it were, like a road on our
return home, that <span id="page_161">p. 161</span> <span
id="iv.i.xiv.x-Page_161"></span>no temptation may take us, but what is
common to man. <span id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md) For this is a
sin, without the body, and must not be reckoned fornication, and on that
account is very easily pardoned. But when the soul does anything in
order to attain those things which are perceived through the body,
through lust of proving or of surpassing or of handling them, in order
that it may place in them its final good, then whatever it does, it does
wickedly, and commits fornication, sinning against its own body: <span
id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) and while snatching from within the
deceitful images of corporeal things, and combining them by vain
thought, so that nothing seems to it to be divine, unless it be of such
a kind as this; by selfish greediness it is made fruitful in errors, and
by selfish prodigality it is emptied of strength. Yet it would not leap
on at once from the commencement to such shameless and miserable
fornication, but, as it is written, “He that contemneth small things,
shall fall by little and little.” <span
