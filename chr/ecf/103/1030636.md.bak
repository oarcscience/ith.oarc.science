<span id="v.iv.xxiv-p1"></span> 23. If, therefore, you had not as yet
vowed unto God widowed continence, we would assuredly exhort you to vow
it; but, in that you have already vowed it, we exhort you to persevere.
And yet I see that I must so speak as to lead those also who had as yet
thought of marriage to love it and to seize on it. Therefore let us give
ear unto the Apostle, “She who is unmarried,” saith he, “is <span
id="page_451">p. 451</span> <span id="v.iv.xxiv-Page_451"></span>careful
about the things of the Lord, to be holy both in body and spirit; but
she who is married is careful about the things of the world, how to
please her husband.” <span id="fr_2277"></span>[2278](#fn_2277.md) He saith
not, is careful about the things of the world, so as not to be holy; but
certainly that that marriage holiness <span
id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278.md) is less, in regard of that portion
of cares, which hath thought of the pleasure of the world. Whatever,
therefore, I of earnest purpose of mind would be expended also on these
things whereby she would have to please a husband, the unmarried
Christian woman ought in a certain way to gather and bring together unto
that earnest purpose whereby she is to please the Lord. And consider,
Whom she pleases, who pleases the Lord; and assuredly she is by so much
the more blessed by how much the more she pleases Him; but by how much
the more her thoughts are of the things of the world, by so much the
less does she please Him. Therefore do ye with all earnest purpose
please Him, Who is “’fair of form above the sons of men.” <span
id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279.md) For that ye please Him, it is by
His grace which is “shed abroad on His lips.” Please ye Him in that
portion of thought also, which would be occupied by the world, in order
to please a husband. Please ye Him, Who displeased the world, in order
that such as please Him might be set free from the world. For This One,
fair of form above the sons of men, men saw on the Cross of the Passion;
“and He had not form or beauty, but His face cast down, and His posture
unseemly.” <span id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280.md) Yet from this
unseemliness of your Redeemer flowed the price of your beauty, but of a
beauty within, for “all the beauty of the King’s daughter is
within.” <span id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281.md) By this beauty
please ye Him, this beauty order ye with studious care and anxious
thought. He loves not dyes of deceits; the Truth delighteth in things
that are true, and He, if you recognize what you have read, is called
the Truth. “I am,” saith He, “the Way, and the Truth, and the
Life.” <span id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282.md) Run ye to Him through
Him, please ye Him of Him; live ye with Him, in Him, of Him. With true
affections and holiest chastity love ye to be loved by such a Husband.
