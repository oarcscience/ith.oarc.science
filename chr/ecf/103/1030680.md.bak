<span id="v.v.xxxvii-p1"></span> 36. For, concerning false witness,
which is set down in the ten commands of the Law, it can indeed in no
wise be contended that love of truth may at heart be preserved, and
false witness brought forth to him unto whom the witness is borne. For,
when it is said to God only, then it is only in the heart that the truth
is to be embraced: but when it is said to man, then must we with the
mouth also of the body bring forth truth, because man is not an
inspector of the heart. But then, touching the witness itself, it is not
unreasonably asked, to whom one is a witness? For not to whomsoever we
speak unto are we witnesses, but to them to whom it is expedient and due
that they by our means should come to know or believe the truth; as is a
judge, that he may not err in judging; or he who is taught in doctrine
of religion, that he may not err in faith, or by very authority of the
teacher waver in doubt. But when the person who interrogates thee or
wishes to know aught from thee seeks that which concerneth him not, or
which is not expedient for him to know, he craveth not a witness, but a
betrayer. Therefore if to him thou tell a lie, from false witness
peradventure thou wilt be clear, but from a lie assuredly not. So then
with this salvo, that to bear false witness is never lawful, the
question is, whether it be lawful sometimes to tell a lie. Or if it be
false witness to lie at all, it is to be seen whether it admit of
compensation, to wit, that it be said for the sake of avoiding a greater
sin: as that which is written, “Honor father and mother,” <span
id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364.md) under stress of a preferable duty
is disregarded; whence the paying of the last honors of sepulture to a
father, is forbidden to that man who by the Lord Himself is called to
preach the kingdom of God.
