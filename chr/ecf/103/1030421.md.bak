<span id="iv.v.vii"></span>

<span id="iv.v.vii-p1"></span> 7. “Give heed unto me,” the Church says
unto you; give heed unto me, whom ye see, although to see ye be
unwilling. For the faithful, who were in those times in the land of
Judæa, were present at, and learnt as present, Christ’s wonderful birth
of a virgin, and His passion, resurrection, ascension; all His divine
words and deeds. These things ye have not seen, and therefore ye refuse
to believe. Therefore behold these things, fix your eyes on these
things, these things which ye see reflect on, which are not told you as
things past, nor foretold you as things future, but are shown you as
things present. What? seemeth it to you a vain or a light thing. and
think you it to be none, or a little, divine miracle, that in the name
of One Crucified the whole human race runs? Ye saw not what was foretold
and fulfilled concerning the human birth of Christ, “Behold, a Virgin
shall conceive in the womb, and shall bear a Son;” <span
id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667.md) but you see the Word of God which
was foretold and fulfilled unto Abraham, “In thy seed shall all nations
be blessed.” <span id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668.md) Ye saw not what
was foretold concerning the wonderful works of Christ, “Come ye, and see
the works of the Lord, what wonders He hath set upon the earth:” <span
id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669.md) but ye see that which was foretold,
“The Lord said unto Me, My Son art Thou, I have this day begotten Thee;
demand of Me and I will give <span id="page_341">p. 341</span> <span
id="iv.v.vii-Page_341"></span>Thee nations as Thy inheritance, and as
Thy possession the bounds of the earth.” <span
id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670.md) Ye saw not that which was foretold
and fulfilled concerning the Passion of Christ, “They pierced My hands
and My feet, they numbered all My bones; but they themselves regarded
and beheld Me; they divided among them My garments, and upon My vesture
they cast the lot;” <span id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671.md) but ye
see that which was in the same Psalm foretold, and now is clearly
fulfilled; “All the ends of the earth shall remember and be turned unto
the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship in His
sight; for the kingdom is the Lord’s, and He shall rule over the
nations.” <span id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672.md) Ye saw not what was
foretold and fulfilled concerning the Resurrection of Christ, the Psalm
speaking, in His Person, first concerning His betrayer and persecutors:
“They went forth out of doors, and spake together: against Me whispered
all My enemies, against Me thought they evil for Me;” they set in order
an unrighteous word against Me. <span
id="fr_1673"></span>[1674](#fn_1673.md) Where, to show that they availed
nothing by slaying Him Who was about to rise again, He adds and says;
“What? will not He, that sleeps, add this, that He rise again?” And a
little after, when He had foretold, by means of the same prophecy,
concerning His betrayer himself, that which is written in the Gospel
also, “He that did eat of My bread, enlarged his heel upon Me,” <span
id="fr_1674"></span>[1675](#fn_1674.md) that is, trampled Me under foot: He
straightway added, “But do Thou, O Lord, have mercy upon Me, and raise
Thou Me up again, and I shall repay them.” This was fulfilled, Christ
slept and awoke, that is, rose again: Who through the same prophecy in
another Psalm says, “I slept and took my rest; and I rose again, for the
Lord will uphold Me.” <span id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675.md) But
this ye saw not, but ye see His Church, concerning whom it is written in
like manner, and fulfilled, “O Lord My God, the nations shall come unto
Thee from the extremity of the earth and shall say, Truly our fathers
worshipped lying images, and there is not in them any profit.” <span
id="fr_1676"></span>[1677](#fn_1676.md) This certainly, whether ye will or
no, ye behold; even although ye yet believe, that there either is, or
was, in those idols some profit; yet certainly unnumbered peoples of the
nations, after having left, or cast away, or broken in pieces such like
vanities, ye have heard say, “Truly our fathers worshipped lying images,
and there is not in them any profit; shall a man make gods, and, lo,
they are no gods?” <span id="fr_1677"></span>[1678](#fn_1677.md) Nor think
that it was foretold that the nations should come unto some one place of
God, in that it was said, “Unto Thee shall the nations come from the
extremity of the earth.” Understand, if you can, that unto the God of
the Christians, Who is the Supreme and True God, the peoples of the
nations come, not by walking but by believing. For the same thing was by
another prophet thus foretold, “The Lord,” saith he, “shall prevail
against them, and shall utterly destroy all the gods of the nations of
the earth: and all the isles of the nations shall worship Him, each man
from his place.” <span id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678.md) Whereas the
one says, “Unto Thee all nations shall come;” this the other says, “They
shall worship Him, each man from his place.” Therefore they shall come
unto Him, not departing from their own place, because believing in Him
they shall find Him in their hearts. Ye saw not what was foretold and
fulfilled concerning the ascension of Christ; “Be Thou exalted above the
Heavens, O God;” <span id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679.md) but ye see
what follows immediately after, “And above all the earth Thy Glory.”
Those things concerning Christ already done and past, all of them ye
have not seen; but these things present in His Church ye deny not that
ye see. Both things we point out to you as foretold; but the fulfillment
of both we are therefore unable to point out for you to see, because we
cannot bring back into sight things past.
