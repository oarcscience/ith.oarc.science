id="iv.ii.cxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 110.—The Benefit to the Souls of the
Dead from the Sacraments and Alms of Their Living Friends.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cxii-p2"></span>Nor can it be denied that the souls of
the dead are benefited by the piety of their living friends, who offer
the sacrifice of the Mediator, or give alms in the church on their
behalf. But these services are of advantage only to those who during
their lives have earned such merit, that services of this kind can help
them. For there is a manner of life which is neither so good as not to
require these services after death, nor so bad that such services are of
no avail after death; there is, on the other hand, a kind of life so
good as not to require them; and again, one so bad that when life is
over they render no help. Therefore, it is in this life that all the
merit or demerit is acquired, which can either relieve or aggravate a
man’s sufferings after this life. No one, then, need hope that after he
is dead he shall obtain merit with God which he has neglected to secure
here. And accordingly it is plain that the services which the church
celebrates for the dead are in no way opposed to the apostle’s words:
“For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ; that every
one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath
done, whether it be good or bad;” <span
id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md) for the merit which renders such
services as I speak of profitable to a man, is earned while he lives in
the body. It is not to every one that these services are profitable. And
why are they not profitable to all, except because of the different
kinds of lives that men lead in the body? When, then, sacri<span
id="page_273">p. 273</span> <span id="iv.ii.cxii-Page_273"></span>fices
either of the altar or of alms are offered on behalf of all the baptized
dead, they are thank-offerings for the very good, they are propitiatory
offerings for the not very bad, and in the case of the very bad, even
though they do not assist the dead, they are a species of consolation to
the living. And where they are profitable, their benefit consists either
in obtaining a full remission of sins, or at least in making the
condemnation more tolerable.
