<span id="iv.vi.viii-p1"></span> 7. And further, analogy, whereby the
agreement of both Testaments is plainly seen, why shall I say that all
have made use of, to whose authority they yield; whereas it is in their
power to consider with themselves, how many things they are wont to say
have been inserted in the divine Scriptures by certain, I know not who,
corrupters of truth? Which speech of theirs I always thought to be most
weak, even at the time that I was their hearer: nor I alone, but you
also, (for I well remember,) and all of us, who essayed to exercise a
little more care in forming a judgment than the crowd of hearers. But
now, after that many things have been expounded and made clear to me,
which used chiefly to move me: those I mean, wherein their discourse for
the most part boasts itself, and expatiates the more freely, the more
safely it can do so as having no opponent; it seems to me that there is
no assertion of theirs more shameless, or (to use a milder phrase) more
careless and weak than that the divine Scriptures have been corrupted;
whereas there are no copies in existence, in a matter of so recent date,
whereby they can prove it. For were they to assert, that they thought
not that they ought thoroughly to receive them, because they had been
written by persons, who they thought had not written the truth; any how
their refusal <span id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702) would be more
right, or their error more natural. <span
id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703) For this is what they have done in
the case of the Book which is inscribed the Acts of the Apostles. And
this device of theirs, when I consider with myself, I cannot enough
wonder at. For it is not the want of wisdom in the men that I complain
of in this matter, but the want of ordinary understanding. <span
id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704) For that book hath so great
matters, which are like what they receive, that it seems to me great
folly to refuse to receive this book also, and if any thing offend them
there to call it false and inserted. Or, if such language is shameless,
as it is why in the Epistles of Paul, why in the four books of the
Gospel, do they think that they <span
id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705) are of any avail, in which I am not
sure but that there are in proportion many more things, than could be in
that book, which they will have believed to have been interpolated by
falsifiers. But forsooth this is what I believe to be the case, and I
ask of you to consider it with me with as calm and serene a judgment as
possible. For you know that, essaying to bring the person of their
founder Manichæus into the number of the Apostles, they say that the
Holy Spirit, Whom the Lord promised His disciples that He would send,
hath come to us through him. Therefore, were they to receive those Acts
of the Apostles, in which the coming of the Holy Spirit is plainly set
forth, <span id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706) they could not find
how to say that it was interpolated. For they will have it that there
were some, I know not who, falsifiers of the divine Books before the
times of Manichæus himself; and that they were falsified by persons who
wished to combine the Law of the Jews with the Gospel. But this they
cannot say concerning the Holy Spirit, unless haply they assert that
those persons divined, and set in their books what should be brought
forward against Manichæus, who should at some future time arise, and say
that the Holy Spirit had been sent through him. But concerning the Holy
Spirit we will speak somewhat more plainly in another place. Now let us
return to my purpose.
