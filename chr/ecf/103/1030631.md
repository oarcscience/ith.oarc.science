<span id="v.iv.xix-p1"></span> 18. No one indeed of these six widows
could come up to your standard. For you, in case that you shall have
maintained this vow even unto old age, mayest have all the three things
wherein the desert of Anna excelled. For both thou hast had one husband,
and he lived not long with thee in the flesh; and, by this means, in
case that thou shall show forth obedience to the words of the Apostle,
saying, “But she who is a widow indeed and desolate, hath hoped in the
Lord, and persevereth in prayers night and day,” <span
id="fr_2260"></span>[2261](#fn_2260) and with sober watchfulness shall
shun what follows, “But she who passes her time in delights, living is
dead,” all those three goods, which were Anna’s, shall be thine also.
But you have sons also, which haply she had not. And yet you are not on
this account to be praised, that you have them, but that you are zealous
to nurture and educate them piously. For that they were born to thee,
was of fruitfulness; that they are alive, is of good fortune; that they
be so brought up, is of your will and disposal. <span
id="fr_2261"></span>[2262](#fn_2261) In the former let men congratulate
you, in this let them imitate you. Anna, through prophetic knowledge,
recognized Christ with His virgin Mother; thee the grace of the Gospel
hath made the mother of a virgin of Christ. Therefore that holy
virgin, <span id="fr_2262"></span>[2263](#fn_2262) whom herself willing
and seeking it ye have offered unto Christ, hath added something of
virginal desert also unto the widowed deserts of her grandmother and
mother. For ye who have her, fail not to have something thence; and in
her ye are, what in yourselves ye are not. For that holy virginity
should be taken from you at your marriage, was on this account brought
to pass, in order that she should be born of you.
