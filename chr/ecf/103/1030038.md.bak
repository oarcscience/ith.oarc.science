<span id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—In What Manner Moses Saw
God.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p2"></span>26. There is yet another difficulty
which troubles most people, *viz*. that it is written, “And the Lord
spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend;”
whereas a little after, the same Moses says, “Now therefore, I pray
Thee, if I have found grace in Thy sight, show me now Thyself plainly,
that I may see Thee, that I may find grace in Thy sight, and that I may
consider that this nation is Thy people;” and a little after Moses again
said to the Lord, “Show me Thy glory.” What means this then, that in
everything which was done, as above said, God was thought to have
appeared by His own substance; whence the Son of God has been believed
by these miserable people to be visible not by the creature, but by
Himself; and that Moses, entering into the cloud, appeared to have had
this very object in entering, that a cloudy darkness indeed might be
shown to the eyes of the people, but that Moses within might hear the
words of God, as though he beheld His face; and, as it is said, “And the
Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend;”
and yet, behold, the same Moses says, “If I have found grace in Thy
sight, show me Thyself plainly?” Assuredly he knew that he saw
corporeally, and he sought the true sight of God spiritually. And that
mode of speech accordingly which was wrought in words, was so modified,
as if it were of a friend speaking to a friend. Yet who sees God the
Father with the eyes of the body? And that Word, which was in the
beginning, the Word which was with God, the Word which was God, by which
all things were made, <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) —who sees
Him with the eyes of the body? And the spirit of wisdom, again, who sees
with the eyes of the body? Yet what is, “Show me now Thyself plainly,
that I may see Thee,” unless, Show me Thy substance? But if Moses had
not said this, we must indeed have borne with those foolish people as we
could, who think that the substance of God was made visible to his eyes
through those things which, as above mentioned, were said or done. But
when it is here demonstrated most evidently that this was *not granted*
to him, even though he desired it; who will dare to say, that by the
like forms which had appeared visibly to him also, not the creature
serving God, but that itself which is God, appeared to the eyes of a
mortal man?

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p4"></span>28. Add, too, that which the Lord
afterward said to Moses, “Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no
man see my face, and live. And the Lord said, Behold, there is a place
by me, and thou shall stand upon a rock: and it shall come to pass,
while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee into a watch-tower <span
id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) of the rock, and will cover thee with
my hand while I pass by: and I will take away my hand, and thou shalt
see my back parts; but my face shall not be seen.” <span

in S. Aug., but the Benedictines read *specula* = watch-tower, which the
context proves to be certainly right.
