<span id="v.iii.ii-p1"></span> 1. W<span class="c19"><span
id="v.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>e</span> lately put forth a book “of the Good
of Marriage,” in which also we admonished and admonish the virgins of
Christ, not, on account of that greater gift which they have received,
to despise, in comparison of themselves, the fathers and mothers of the
People of God; and not to think those men, <span
id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024) (whom the Apostle sets forth as the
olive, that the engrafted wild olive be not proud,) who did service to
Christ about to come hereafter, even by the begetting of sons, on this
account of less desert, because by divine right continence is preferred
to wedded life, and pious virginity to marriage. Forsooth in them were
being prepared and brought forth future things, which now we see
fulfilled in a marvellous and effectual manner, whose married life also
was prophetic: whence, not after the wonted custom of human wishes and
joys, but by the very deep counsel of God, in certain of them
fruitfulness obtained to be honored, in certain also barrenness to be
made fruitful. But at this time, towards them unto whom it is said, “if
they contain not, let them be married,” <span
id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025) we must use not consolation, but
exhortation. But them, unto whom it is said, “Whoso can receive, let him
receive,” <span id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026) we must exhort,
that they be not alarmed; and alarm that they be not lifted up.
Wherefore virginity is not only to be set forth, that it may be loved,
but also to be admonished, that it be not puffed up.
