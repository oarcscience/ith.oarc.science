<span id="v.v.xx-p1"></span> 19. These sorts of lies having been without
any hesitation condemned, next follows a sort, as it were by steps
rising to something better, which is commonly attributed to well-meaning
and good people, when the person who lies not only does no harm to
another, but even benefits somebody. Now it is on this sort of lies that
the whole dispute turns, whether that person does harm to himself, who
benefits another in such sort as to act contrary to the truth. Or, if
that alone may be called truth which illustrateth the very minds of men
with an intimate and incommutable light, at least he acts contrary to
some true thing, because although the bodily senses are deceived, yet he
acts contrary to a true thing who says that a thing is so or not so,
whereof neither his mind nor senses nor his opinion or belief giveth him
any report. Whether therefore he does not hurt himself in so profiting
another, or in that compensation not hurt himself in which he profiteth
the other, is a great question. If it be so, it should follow that he
ought to profit himself by a lie which damages no man. But these things
hang together, and if you concede that point, it necessarily draws in
its train some very embarrassing consequences. For should it be asked,
what harm it does to a person rolling in superfluous wealth, if from
countless thousands of bushels of wheat he lose one bushel, which bushel
may be profitable as necessary food to the person stealing it; it will
follow that theft also may be committed without blame, and false witness
borne without sin. Than which, what can be mentioned more perverse? Or
truly, if another had stolen the bushel, and thou sawest it done, and
wert questioned, wouldest thou tell a lie with honesty for the poor man,
and if thou do it for thine own poverty wilt thou be blamed? As if it
were thy duty to love another more than thyself. Both then are
disgraceful, and must be avoided.
