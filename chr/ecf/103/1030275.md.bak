id="iv.ii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—God’s Judgments Upon Fallen Men
and Angels. The Death of the Body is Man’s Peculiar Punishment.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxvii-p2"></span>And yet such a nature, in the midst of
all its evils, could not lose the craving after happiness. Now the evils
I have mentioned are common to all who for their wickedness have been
justly condemned by God, whether they be men or angels. But there is one
form of punishment peculiar to man—the death of the body. God had
threatened him with this punishment of death if he should sin, <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120.md) leaving him indeed to the freedom
of his own will, but yet commanding his obedience under pain of death;
and He placed him amid the happiness of Eden, as it were in a protected
nook of life, with the intention that, if he preserved his
righteousness, he should thence ascend to a better place.
