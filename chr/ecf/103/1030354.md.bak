id="iv.ii.cvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 104.—God, Foreknowing the Sin of the
First Man, Ordered His Own Purposes Accordingly.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cvi-p2"></span>Wherefore, God would have been willing to
preserve even the first man in that state of salvation in which he was
created, and after he had begotten sons to remove him at a fit time,
without the intervention of death, to a better place, where he should
have been not only free from sin, but free even from the desire of
sinning, if He had foreseen that man would have the steadfast will to
persist in the state of innocence in which he was created. But as He
foresaw that man would make a bad use of his free-will, that is, would
sin, God arranged His own designs rather with a view to do good to man
even in his sinfulness, that thus the good will of the Omnipotent might
not be made void by the evil will of man, but might be fulfilled in
spite of it.
