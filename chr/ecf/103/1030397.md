<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Of the Mission of the Holy
Ghost Fifty Days After Christ’s Resurrection.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p2"></span>41. “Thereafter, having confirmed the
disciples, and having sojourned with them forty days, He ascended up
into heaven, as these same persons were beholding Him. And on the
completion of fifty days from His resurrection He sent to them the Holy
Spirit (for so He had promised), by whose agency they were to have love
shed abroad in their hearts, <span id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472.md)
to the end that they might be able to fulfill the law, not only without
the sense of its being burdensome, but even with a joyful mind. This law
was given to the Jews in the ten commandments, which they call the
Decalogue. And these commandments, again, are reduced to two, namely
that we should love God with all our heart, with all our soul, with all
our mind; and that we should love our neighbor as ourselves. <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473.md) For that on these two precepts hang
all the law and the prophets, the Lord Himself has at once declared in
the Gospel and shown in His own example. For thus it was likewise in the
instance of the people of Israel, that from the day on which they first
celebrated the passover in a form, <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474.md) slaying and eating the sheep, with
whose blood their door-posts were marked for the securing of their
safety, <span id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475.md) —from this day, I
repeat, the fiftieth day in succession was completed, and then they
received the law written by the finger of God, <span
id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476.md) under which phrase we have already
stated that the Holy Spirit is signified. <span
id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477.md) And in the same manner, after the
passion and resurrection of the Lord, who is the true passover, the Holy
Ghost was sent personally to the disciples on the fiftieth day: not now,
however, by tables of stone significant of the hardness of their hearts;
but, when they were gathered together in one place at Jerusalem itself,
suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as if a violent blast were
being borne onwards, and there appeared to them tongues cloven like
fire, and they began to speak with tongues, in such a manner that all
those who had come to them recognized each his own language <span
id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478.md) (for in that city the Jews were in
the habit of assembling from every country wheresoever they had been
scattered abroad, and had learned the diverse tongues of diverse
nations); and thereafter, preaching Christ with all boldness, they
wrought many signs in His name,—so much so, that as Peter was passing
by, his shadow touched a certain dead person, and the man rose in life
again. <span id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479.md)

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p11"></span>42. “But when the Jews perceived so
great signs to be wrought in the name of Him, whom, partly through
ill-will and partly in ignorance, they crucified, some of them were
provoked to persecute the apostles, who were His preachers; while
others, on the contrary, marvelling the more at this very circumstance,
that so great miracles were being performed in the name of Him whom they
had derided as one overborne and conquered by themselves, repented, and
were converted, so that thousands of Jews believed on Him. For these
parties were not bent now on craving at the hand of God temporal
benefits and an earthly kingdom, neither did they look any more for
Christ, the promised king, in a carnal spirit; but they continued in
immortal fashion to apprehend and love Him, who in mortal fashion
endured on their behalf at their own hands sufferings so heavy, and
imparted to them the gift of forgiveness for all their sins, even down
to the iniquity of His own blood, and by the example of His own
resurrection unfolded immortality as the object which they should hope
for and long for at His hands. Accordingly, now mortifying the earthly
cravings of the old man, and inflamed with the new experience of the
spiritual life, as the Lord had enjoined in the Gospel, they sold all
that they had, and laid the price of their possessions at the feet of
the apostles, in order that these might distribute to every man
according as each had need; and living in Christian love harmoniously
with each other, they did not affirm anything to be their own, but they
had all things in common, and were one in soul and heart toward
God. <span id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480.md) Afterwards these same
persons also themselves suffered persecution <span id="page_309">p.
309</span> <span id="iv.iii.xxiv-Page_309"></span>in their flesh at the
hands of the Jews, their carnal fellow-countrymen, and were dispersed
abroad, to the end that, in consequence of their dispersion, Christ
should be preached more extensively, and that they themselves at the
same time should be followers of the patience of their Lord. For He who
in meekness had endured them, <span id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481.md)
enjoined them in meekness to endure for His sake.

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p14"></span>43. “Among those same persecutors of
the saints the Apostle Paul had once also ranked; and he raged with
eminent violence against the Christians. But, subsequently, he became a
believer and an apostle, and was sent to preach the gospel to the
Gentiles, suffering (in that ministry) things more grievous on behalf of
the name of Christ than were those which he had done against the name of
Christ. Moreover, in establishing churches throughout all the nations
where he was sowing the seed of the gospel, he was wont to give earnest
injunction that, as these converts (coming as they did from the worship
of idols and without experience in the worship of the one God) could not
readily serve God in the way of selling and distributing their
possessions, they should make offerings for the poor brethren among the
saints who were in the churches of Judea which had believed in Christ.
In this manner the doctrine of the apostle constituted some to be, as it
were, soldiers, and others to be, as it were, provincial tributaries,
while it set Christ in the centre of them like the corner-stone (in
accordance with what had been announced beforetime by the
prophet), <span id="fr_1482"></span>[1483](#fn_1482.md) in whom both
parties, like walls advancing from different sides, that is to say, from
Jews and from Gentiles, might be joined together in the affection of
kinship. But at a later period heavier and more frequent persecutions
arose from the unbelieving Gentiles against the Church of Christ, and
day by day was fulfilled that prophetic word which the Lord spake when
He said, ‘Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves.’ <span

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p13"></span> Adopting the Benedictine version,

12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003.md)<span

3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p13.3"></span>.
There is, however, great variety of reading here. Thus we find *qui ante
eos*, *etc.* = who had suffered in meekness before them: *qui pro eis*,
*etc.* = who had suffered in their stead: *qui propter eos*, *etc.* =
who had suffered on their account: and *qui per eos*, *etc.* = who had
suffered through them, etc. But the reading in the text appears best
authenticated.
