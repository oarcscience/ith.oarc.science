<span id="v.iii.liv-p1"></span> 53. Wherefore this do ye, virgins of
God, this do ye: follow ye the Lamb, whithersoever He shall have gone.
But first come unto Him, Whom ye are to follow, and learn, in that He is
meek and lowly of heart. Come ye in lowly wise unto the Lowly, if ye
love: and depart not from Him, lest ye fall. For whoso fears to depart
from Him asks and says, “Let there not come to me foot of pride.” <span
id="fr_2213"></span>[2214](#fn_2213.md) Go on in the way of loftiness with
the foot of lowliness; Himself lifteth up such <span id="page_437">p.
437</span> <span id="v.iii.liv-Page_437"></span>as follow in lowly wise,
Who thought it not a trouble to come down unto such as lay low. Commit
ye His gifts unto Him to keep, “guard ye your strength unto Him.” <span
id="fr_2214"></span>[2215](#fn_2214.md) Whatever of evil through His
guardianship ye commit not, account as forgiven unto you by Him: lest,
thinking that you have little forgiven unto you, ye love little, and
with ruinous boasting despise the publicans beating their breasts.
Concealing that strength of yours which hath been tried beware, that ye
be not puffed up, because ye have been able to bear something: but
concerning that which hath been untried pray, that ye be not tempted
above that ye are able to bear. Think that some are superior to you in
secret, than whom ye are openly better. When the good things of others,
haply unknown to you, are kindly believed by you, your own that are
known to you are not lessened by comparison, but strengthened by love:
and what haply as yet are wanting, are by so much the more easily given,
by how much they are the more humbly desired. Let such among your number
as persevere, afford to you an example: but let such as fall increase
your fear. Love the one that ye may imitate it; mourn over the other,
that ye be not puffed up. Do not ye establish your own righteousness;
submit yourselves unto God Who justifies you. Pardon the sins of others,
pray for your own: future sins shun by watching, past sins blot out by
confessing.
