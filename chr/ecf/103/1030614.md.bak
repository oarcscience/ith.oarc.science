<span id="v.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="v.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Augustin</span> the Bishop, servant of Christ,
and of the servants of Christ, unto the religious handmaiden of God,
Juliana, in the Lord of lords health.

<span id="v.iv.ii-p2"></span>Not any longer to be in debt of my promise
to your request and love in Christ, I have seized the occasion as I
could, amid other my very pressing engagements, to write to you somewhat
concerning the profession of holy widowhood, forasmuch as, when I was
present, you laded me with entreaty, and, when I had not been able to
deny you this, you often by letters demanded my promise. And in this
work of ours, when you shall find in reading that some things pertain
not at all unto your own person, or unto the person of you, who are
living together in Christ, nor are strictly necessary to give counsel
unto your life, it will be your duty not on this account to judge them
superfluous. Forsooth this letter, although it be addressed to you, was
not to be written for you alone; but certainly it was a matter for us
not to neglect, that it should profit others also through your means.
Whatsoever, therefore, you shall find here, such as either hath been at
no time necessary for you, or is not so now, and which yet you shall
perceive to be necessary for others, grieve not either to possess or to
lend to read; that your charity also may be the profit of others.
