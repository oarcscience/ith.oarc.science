<span id="v.ii.xxvi-p1"></span> 25. Forsooth continence is a virtue, not
of the body, but of the soul. But the virtues of the soul are sometimes
shown in work, sometimes lie hid in habit, as the virtue of martyrdom
shone forth and appeared by enduring sufferings; but how many are there
of the same virtue of mind, unto whom trial is wanting, whereby what is
within, in the sight of God, may go forth also into the sight of men,
and not to men begin to exist, but only become known? For there was
already in Job patience, which God knew, and to which He bore witness:
but it became known unto men by test of trial: <span
id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000.md) and what lay hid within was not
produced, but shown, by the things that were brought on him from
without. Timothy also certainly had the virtue of abstaining from
wine, <span id="fr_2001"></span>[2002](#fn_2001.md) which Paul took not
from him, by advising him to use a moderate portion of wine, “for the
sake of his stomach and his often infirmities,” otherwise he taught him
a deadly lesson, that for the sake of the health <span id="page_410">p.
410</span> <span id="v.ii.xxvi-Page_410"></span>of the body there should
be a loss of virtue in the soul: but because what he advised could take
place with safety to that virtue, the profit of drinking was so left
free to the body, as that the habit of continence continued in the soul.
For it is the habit itself, whereby any thing is done, when there is
need; <span id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002.md) but when it is not
done, it can be done, only there is no need. This habit, in the matter
of that continence which is from sexual intercourse, they have not, unto
whom it is said, “If they contain not, let them be married.” <span
id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003.md) But this they have, unto whom it is
said, “Whoso can receive, let him receive.” <span
id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004.md) Thus have perfect souls used
earthly goods, that are necessary for something else, through this habit
of continence, so as, by it, not to be bound by them, and so as by it,
to have power also not to use them, in case there were no need. Nor doth
any use them well, save who hath power also not to use them. Many indeed
with more ease practise abstinence, so as not to use, than practise
temperance, so as to use well. But no one can wisely use them, save who
can also continently not use them. From this habit Paul also said, “I
know both to abound, and to suffer want.” <span
id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005.md) Forsooth to suffer want is the part
of any men soever; but to know to suffer want is the part of great men.
So, also, to abound, who cannot? but to know also to abound, is not,
save of those, whom abundance corrupts not.
