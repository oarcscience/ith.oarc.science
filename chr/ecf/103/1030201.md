<span id="iv.i.xvi.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—There is a Kind of Trinity in
the Holding, Contemplating, and Loving of Faith Temporal, But One that
Does Not Yet Attain to Being Properly an Image of God.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvi.ii-p2"></span>4. Wherefore since, as it is written,
“While we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord; for we walk by
faith, not by sight;” <span id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868)
undoubtedly, so long as the just man lives by faith, <span
id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869) howsoever he lives according to the
inner man, although he aims at truth and reaches on to things eternal by
this same temporal faith, nevertheless in the holding, contemplating,
and loving this temporal faith, we have not yet reached such a trinity
as is to be called an image of God; lest that should seem to be
constituted in things temporal which ought to be so in things eternal.
For when the human mind sees its own faith, whereby it believes what it
does not see, it does not see a thing eternal. For that will not always
exist, which certainly will not then exist, when this pilgrimage,
whereby we are absent from God, in such way that we must needs walk by
faith, shall be ended, and that sight shall have succeeded it whereby we
shall see face to face; <span id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870) just as
now, because we believe although we do not see, we shall deserve to see,
and shall rejoice at having been brought through faith to sight. For
then it will be no longer faith, by which that is believed which is not
seen; but sight, by which that is seen which is believed. And then,
therefore, although we remember this past mortal life, and call to mind
by recollection that we once believed what we did not see, yet that
faith will be reckoned among things past and done with, not among things
present and always continuing. And hence also that trinity which now
consists in the remembering, contemplating, and loving this same faith
while present and continuing, will then be found to be done with and
past, and not still enduring. And hence it is to be gathered, that if
that trinity is indeed an im<span id="page_185">p. 185</span> <span
id="iv.i.xvi.ii-Page_185"></span>age of God, then this image itself
would have to be reckoned, not among things that exist always, but among
things transient.
