<span id="iv.ii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—The Preceding Argument is in No
Wise Inconsistent with the Saying of Our Lord: “A Good Tree Cannot Bring
Forth Evil Fruit.”</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xvii-p2"></span>But when we say that evil springs out of
good, let it not be thought that this contradicts our Lord’s saying: “A
good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit.” <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105) For, as He who is the Truth says,
you cannot gather grapes of thorns, <span
id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106) because grapes do not grow on
thorns. But we see that on good soil both vines and thorns may be grown.
And in the same way, just as an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit,
so an evil will cannot produce good works. But from the nature of man,
which is good, may spring either a good or an evil will. And certainly
there was at first no source from which an evil will could spring,
except <span id="page_242">p. 242</span> <span
id="iv.ii.xvii-Page_242"></span>the nature of angel or of man, which was
good. And our Lord Himself clearly shows this in the very same place
where He speaks about the tree and its fruit. For He says: “Either make
the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and
his fruit corrupt,” <span id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107) —clearly
enough warning us that evil fruits do not grow on a good tree, nor good
fruits on an evil tree; but that nevertheless the ground itself, by
which He meant those whom He was then addressing, might grow either kind
of trees.
