id="iv.ii.xcvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 94.—The Saints Shall Know More Fully
in the Next World the Benefits They Have Received by Grace.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xcvi-p2"></span>Thus, when reprobate angels and men are
left to endure everlasting punishment, the saints shall know more fully
the benefits they have received by grace. Then, in contemplation of the
actual facts, they shall see more clearly the meaning of the expression
in the psalms, “I will sing of mercy and judgment;” <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[1274](#fn_1273.md) for it is only of unmerited mercy
that any is redeemed, and only in well-merited judgment that any is
condemned.
