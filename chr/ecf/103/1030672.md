<span id="v.v.xxix-p1"></span> 28. It is also written, “But I say unto
you, Swear not at all.” But the Apostle himself has used oaths in his
Epistles. <span id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341.md) And so he shows how
that is to be taken which is said, “I say unto you, Swear not at all:”
that is, lest by swearing one come to a facility in swearing, from
facility to a custom, and so from a custom there be a downfall into
perjury. And therefore he is not found to have sworn except in writing,
where there is more wary forethought, and no precipitate tongue withal.
And this indeed came of evil, as it is said, “Whatever is more than
these is of evil:” <span id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342.md) not
however from evil of his own, but from the evil of infirmity which was
in them, in whom he even in this way endeavored to work faith. For that
he used an oath in speaking, while not writing, I know not that any
Scripture has related concerning him. And yet the Lord says, “Swear not
at all:” for He hath not granted license thereof to persons writing.
Howbeit, because to pronounce Paul guilty of violating the commandment,
especially in Epistles written and sent forth for the spiritual life and
salvation of the nations, were an impiety, we must understand that word
which is set down, “At all,” to be set down for this purpose, that as
much as in thee lies, thou affect not, love not, nor as though it were
for a good thing, with any delight desire, an oath.
