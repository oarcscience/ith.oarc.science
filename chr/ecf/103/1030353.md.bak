<span id="iv.ii.cv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.cv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 103.—Interpretation of the Expression
in</span> [1 Tim. 2.4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.ii.cv-p1.2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.cv-p1.3"></span>: “Who Will Have All Men to Be Saved.”</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cv-p2"></span>Accordingly, when we hear and read in
Scripture that He “will have all men to be saved,” <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293.md) although we know well that all men
are not saved, we are not on that account to restrict the omnipotence of
God, but are rather to understand the Scripture, “Who will have all men
to be saved,” as meaning that no man is saved unless God wills his
salvation: not that there is no man whose salvation He does not will,
but that no man is saved apart from His will; and that, therefore, we
should pray Him to will our salvation, because if He will it, it must
necessarily be accomplished. And it was of prayer to God that the
apostle was speaking when he used this expression. And on the same
principle we interpret the expression in the Gospel: “The true light
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world:” <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294.md) not that there is no man who is not
enlightened, but that no man is enlightened except by Him. Or, it is
said, “Who will have all men to be saved;” not that there is no man
whose salvation He does not will (for how, then, explain the fact that
He was unwilling to work miracles in the presence of some who, He said,
would have repented if He had worked them?), but that we are to
understand by “all men,” the human race in all its varieties of rank and
circumstances,—kings, subjects; noble, plebeian, high, low, learned, and
unlearned; the sound in body, the feeble, the clever, the dull, the
foolish, the rich, the poor, and those of middling circumstances; males,
females, infants, boys, youths; young, middle-aged, and old men; of
every tongue, of every fashion, of all arts, of all professions, with
all the innumerable differences of will and conscience, and whatever
else there is that makes a distinction among men. For which of all these
classes is there out of which God does not will that men should be saved
in all nations through His only-begotten Son, our Lord, and therefore
does save them; for the Omnipotent cannot will in vain, whatsoever He
may will? Now the apostle had enjoined that prayers should be made for
all men, and had especially added, “For kings, and for all that are in
authority,” who might be supposed, in the pride and pomp of worldly
station, to shrink from the humility of the Christian faith. Then
saying, “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our
Saviour,” that is, that prayers should be made for such as these, he
immediately adds, as if to remove any ground of despair, “Who will have
all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.” <span
id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295.md) God, then, in His great
condescension has judged it good to grant to the prayers of the humble
the salvation of the exalted; and assuredly we have many examples of
this. Our Lord, too, makes use of the same mode of speech in the Gospel,
when He says to the Pharisees: “Ye tithe mint, <span id="page_271">p.
271</span> <span id="iv.ii.cv-Page_271"></span>and rue, and every
herb.” <span id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296.md) For the Pharisees did
not tithe what belonged to others, nor all the herbs of all the
inhabitants of other lands. As, then, in this place we must understand
by “every herb,” every kind of herbs, so in the former passage we may
understand by “all men,” every sort of men. And we may interpret it in
any other way we please, so long as we are not compelled to believe that
the omnipotent God has willed anything to be done which was not done:
for setting aside all ambiguities, if “He hath done all that He pleased
in heaven and in earth,” <span id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297.md) as
the psalmist sings of Him, He certainly did not will to do anything that
He hath not done.
