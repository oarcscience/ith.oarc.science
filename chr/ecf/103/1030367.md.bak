<span id="iv.ii.cxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.cxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 117.—Love, Which is Greater Than
Faith and Hope, is Shed Abroad in Our Hearts by the Holy Ghost.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cxix-p2"></span>And now as to *love*, which the apostle
declares to be greater than the other two graces, that is, than faith
and hope, <span id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md) the greater the
measure in which it dwells in a man, the better is the man in whom it
dwells. For when there is a question as to whether a man is good, one
does not ask what he believes, or what he hopes, but what he loves. For
the man who loves aright no doubt believes and hopes aright; whereas the
man who has not love believes in vain, even though his beliefs are true;
and hopes in vain, even though the objects of his hope are a real part
of true happiness; unless, indeed, he believes and hopes for this, that
he may obtain by prayer the blessing of love. For, although it is not
possible to hope without love, it may yet happen that a man does not
love that which is necessary to the attainment of his hope; as, for
example, if he hopes for eternal life (and who is there that does not
desire this?) and yet does not love righteousness, without which no one
can attain to eternal life. Now this is the true faith of Christ which
the apos<span id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span
id="iv.ii.cxix-Page_275"></span>tle speaks of, “which worketh by
love;” <span id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md) and if there is
anything that it does not yet embrace in its love, asks that it may
receive, seeks that it may find, and knocks that it may be opened unto
it. <span id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316.md) For faith obtains through
prayer that which the law commands. For without the gift of God, that
is, without the Holy Spirit, through whom love is shed abroad in our
hearts, <span id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317.md) the law can command,
but it cannot assist; and, moreover, it makes a man a transgressor, for
he can no longer excuse himself on the plea of ignorance. Now carnal
lust reigns where there is not the love of God.
