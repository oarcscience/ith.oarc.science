<span id="iv.ii.lxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 63.—The Peace of God, Which Reigneth
in Heaven, Passeth All Understanding.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxv-p2"></span>This peace, as Scripture saith, “passeth
all understanding,” <span id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205.md) and
cannot be known by us until we have come into the full possession of it.
For in what sense are heavenly things reconciled, except they be
reconciled to us, *viz.* by coming into harmony with us? For in heaven
there is unbroken peace, both between all the intelligent creatures that
exist there, and between these and their Creator. And this peace, as is
said, passeth all understanding; but this, of course, means our
understanding, not that of those who always behold the face of their
Father. We now, however great may be our human understanding, know but
in part, and see through a glass darkly. <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206.md) But when we shall be equal unto the
angels of God <span id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207.md) then we shall
see face to face, as they do; and we shall have as great peace towards
them as they have towards us, because we shall love them as much as we
are loved by them. And so their peace shall be known to us: for our own
peace shall be like to theirs, and as great as theirs, nor shall it
<span id="page_258">p. 258</span> <span
id="iv.ii.lxv-Page_258"></span>then pass our understanding. But the
peace of God, the peace which He cherisheth towards us, shall
undoubtedly pass not our understanding only, but theirs as well. And
this must be so: for every rational creature which is happy derives its
happiness from Him; He does not derive His from it. And in this view it
is better to interpret “all” in the passage, “The peace of God passeth
all understanding,” as admitting of no exception even in favor of the
understanding of the holy angels: the only exception that can be made is
that of God Himself. For, of course, His peace does not pass His own
understanding.
