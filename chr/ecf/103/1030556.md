<span id="v.iii.iii-p1"></span> 2. This we have undertaken in our
present discourse: may Christ help us, the Son of a virgin, and the
Spouse of virgins, born after the flesh of a virgin womb, and wedded
after the Spirit in virgin marriage. Whereas, therefore, the whole
Church itself is a virgin espoused unto one Husband Christ, <span
id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027.md) as the Apostle saith, of how great
honor are its members worthy, who guard this even in the flesh itself,
which the whole Church guards in the faith? which imitates the mother of
her husband, and her Lord. For the Church also is both a mother and a
virgin. For whose virgin purity consult we for, if she is not a virgin?
or whose children address we, if she is not a mother? Mary bare the Head
of This Body after the flesh, the Church bears the members of that Body
after the Spirit. In both virginity hinders not fruitfulness: in both
fruitfulness takes not away virginity. Wherefore, whereas the whole
Church is holy both in body and spirit, and yet the whole is not virgin
in body but in spirit; how much <span id="page_418">p. 418</span> <span
id="v.iii.iii-Page_418"></span>more holy is it in these members, wherein
it is virgin both in body and spirit?
