<span id="iv.v.xi-p1"></span> 11. But you, beloved, who possess this
faith, or who have begun now newly to have it, let it be nourished and
increase in you. For as things temporal have come, so long before
foretold, so will things eternal also come, which are promised. Nor let
them deceive you, either the vain heathen, or the false Jews, or the
deceitful heretics, or also within the Catholic (Church) itself evil
Christians, enemies by so much the more hurtful, as they are the more
within us. For, lest on this subject also the weak should be troubled,
divine prophecy hath not been silent, where in the Song of Songs the
Bridegroom speaking unto the Bride, that is, Christ the Lord unto the
Church, saith, “As a lily in the midst of thorns, so is my best
Beloved <span id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687) in the midst of the
daughters.” <span id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688) He said not, in
the midst of them that are without; but, “in the midst of daughters.
Whoso hath ears to hear, let him hear:” <span
id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689) and whilst the net which is cast
into the sea, <span id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690) and gathers
together all kinds of fishes, as saith the holy Gospel, is being drawn
unto the shore, that is, unto the end of the world, let him separate
himself from the evil fishes, in heart, not in body; by changing evil
habits, not by breaking sacred nets; lest they who now seem being
approved to be mingled with the reprobate, find, not life, but
punishment everlasting, <span id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691) when
they shall begin on the shore to be separated.
