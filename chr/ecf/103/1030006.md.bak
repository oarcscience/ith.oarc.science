<span id="iv.i.ii-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv.i.ii-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p3.1"></span>The</span> history of St. Augustin’s treatise
on the Trinity, as gathered by Tillemont and others from his own
allusions to it, may be briefly given. It is placed by him in his
*Retractations* among the works written (which in the present case, it
appears, must mean begun) in <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p3.2"></span>A.D.</span> 400. In letters of <span
class="c19"><span id="iv.i.ii-p3.3"></span>A.D.</span> 410, 414, and at
the end of <span class="c19"><span id="iv.i.ii-p3.4"></span>A.D.</span>
415 (*Ad Consentium*, Ep. 120<span id="iv.i.ii-p3.5"></span>, and two
*Ad Evodium*, Epp. 162, 169), it is referred to as still unfinished and
unpublished. But a letter of <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p3.6"></span> A.D.</span> 412 (*Ad Marcellinum*, Ep.
143<span id="iv.i.ii-p3.7"></span>) intimates that friends were at that
time importuning him, although without success, to complete and publish
it. And the letter to Aurelius, which was sent to that bishop with the
treatise itself when actually completed, informs us that a portion of
it, while it was still unrevised and incomplete, was in fact
surreptitiously made public,—a proceeding which the letters above cited
postpone apparently until at least after <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p3.8"></span>A.D.</span> 415. It was certainly still in hand
in <span class="c19"><span id="iv.i.ii-p3.9"></span>A.D.</span> 416,
inasmuch as in Book XIII. a quotation occurs from the 12th Book of the
*De Civitate Dei*; and another quotation in Book XV., from the 90th
lecture on St. John, indicates most probably a date of at least a year
later, *viz*. <span class="c19"><span id="iv.i.ii-p3.10"></span>
A.D.</span> 417. The *Retractations*, which refer to it, are usually
dated not later than <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.ii-p3.11"></span>A.D.</span> 428. The letter to Bishop Aurelius
also informs us that the work was many years in progress, and was begun
in St. Augustin’s early manhood, and finished in his old age. We may
infer from this evidence that it was written by him between <span
class="c19"><span id="iv.i.ii-p3.12"></span>A.D.</span> 400, when he was
forty-six years old, and had been Bishop of Hippo about four years, and
<span class="c19"><span id="iv.i.ii-p3.13"></span>A.D.</span> 428 at the
latest; but probably it was published ten or twelve years before this
date. He writes of it, indeed, himself, as if the “*nonum prematur in
annum*” very inadequately represented the amount of deliberate and
patient thought which a subject so profound and so sacred demanded, and
which he had striven to give to it; and as if, even at the very last, he
shrank from publishing his work, and was only driven to do so in order
to remedy the mischief of its partial and unauthorized publication.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p4"></span>His motive for writing on the subject may
be learned from the treatise itself. It was not directed against any
individual antagonist, or occasioned by any particular controversial
emergency. In fact, his labors upon it were, he says, continually
interrupted by the distraction of such controversies. Certain ingenious
and subtle theories respecting types or resemblances of the Holy
Trinity, traceable in human nature as being the image of God, seemed to
him to supply, not indeed a logical proof, but a strong rational
presumption, of the truth of the doctrine itself; and thus to make it
incumbent upon him to expound and unfold them in order to meet
rationalizing objectors upon (so to say) their own ground. He is careful
not to deal with these analogies or images as if they either constituted
a purely argumentative proof or exhausted the full meaning of the
doctrine, upon both which assumptions such speculations have at all
times been the fruitful parent both of presumptious theorizing and of
grievous heresy. But he nevertheless employs them more affirmatively
than would perhaps have been the case. While modern theologians would
argue negatively, from the triplicity of independent faculties,—united,
nevertheless, in the unity of a single human person,—that any
presumption of reason against the Trinity of persons in the Godhead is
thereby, if not removed, at least materially and enormously lessened,
St. Augustin seems to argue positively from analogous grounds, as though
they constituted a direct intimation of the doctrine itself. But he
takes especial pains, at the same time, to dwell upon the incapacity of
human thought to fathom the depths of the nature of God; and he
carefully prefaces his reasonings by a statement of the Scripture
evidence of the catholic doctrine as a matter of faith and not of
reason, and by an explanation of difficult texts upon the subject. One
of the most valuable portions, indeed, of the treatise is the eloquent
and profound exposition given in this part of it of the rule of
interpretation to be applied to Scripture language respecting the person
of our Lord. It should be noticed, however, that a large proportion of
St. Augustin’s scriptural exege<span id="page_14">p. 14</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii-Page_14"></span>sis is founded upon a close verbal
exposition of the old Latin version, and is frequently not borne out by
the original text. And the rule followed in rendering Scripture texts in
the present translation has been, accordingly, wherever the argument in
the context rests upon the variations of the old Latin, there to
translate the words as St. Augustin gives them, while adhering otherwise
to the language of the authorized English version. The reader’s
attention may allowably be drawn to the language of Book V. c.x., and to
its close resemblance to some of the most remarkable phrases of the
Athanasian Creed, and again to the striking passage respecting miracles
in Book III. c.v., and to that upon the nature of God at the beginning
of Book V.; the last named of which seems to have suggested one of the
profoundest passages in the profoundest of Dr. Newman’s *University
Sermons* (p. 353, ed. 1843). It may be added, that the writings of the
Greek Fathers on the subject were, if not wholly unknown, yet unfamiliar
to Augustin, who quotes directly only the Latin work of Hilary of
Poictiers.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p5"></span>It remains to say, that the translation
here printed was made about four years since by a friend of the writer
of this preface, and that the latter’s share in the work has been that
of thoroughly revising and correcting it, and of seeing it through the
press. He is therefore answerable for the work as now published.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p7"></span>Nov. 5, 1872.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p8"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv.i.ii-p9"></span>In the *Retractations* (ii. 15) Augustin
speaks of this work in the following terms:—

<span id="iv.i.ii-p10"></span>“I spent some years in writing fifteen
books concerning the Trinity, which is God. When, however, I had not yet
finished the thirteenth Book, and some who were exceedingly anxious to
have the work were kept waiting longer than they could bear, it was
stolen from me in a less correct state than it either could or would
have been had it appeared when I intended. And as soon as I discovered
this, having other copies of it, I had determined at first not to
publish it myself, but to mention what had happened in the matter in
some other work; but at the urgent request of brethren, whom I could not
refuse, I corrected it as much as I thought fit, and finished and
published it, with the addition, at the beginning, of a letter that I
had written to the venerable Aurelius, Bishop of Carthage, in which I
set forth, in the way of prologue, what had happened, what I had
intended to do of myself, and what love of my brethren had forced me to
do.”

<span id="iv.i.ii-p11"></span>The letter to which he here alludes is the
following:—

<span id="iv.i.ii-p12"></span>“To the most blessed Lord, whom he reveres
with most sincere love, to his holy brother and fellow-priest, Pope
Aurelius, Augustin sends health in the Lord.

<span id="iv.i.ii-p13"></span>“I began as a very young man, and have
published in my old age, some books concerning the Trinity, who is the
supreme and true God. I had in truth laid the work aside, upon
discovering that it had been prematurely, or rather surreptitiously,
stolen from me before I had completed it, and before I had revised and
put the finishing touches to it, as had been my intention. For I had not
designed to publish the Books one by one, but all together, inasmuch as
the progress of the inquiry led me to add the later ones to those which
precede them. When, therefore, these people had hindered the fulfillment
of my purpose (in that some of them had obtained access to the work
before I intended), I had given over dictating it, with the idea of
making my complaint public in some other work that I might write, in
order that whoso could might know that the Books had not been published
by myself, but had been taken away from my possession before they were
in my own judgment fit for publication. Compelled, however, by the eager
demands of many of my brethren, and above all by your command, I have
taken the pains, by God’s help, to complete the work, laborious as it
is; and as now corrected (not as I wished, but as I could, lest the
Books should differ very widely from those which had surreptitiously got
into people’s hands), I have sent them to your Reverence by my very dear
son and fellow-deacon, and have allowed them to be heard, copied, and
read by every one that pleases. Doubtless, if I could have fulfilled my
original intention, although they would have contained the same
sentiments, they would have been worked out much more thoroughly and
clearly, so far as the difficulty of unfolding so profound a subject,
and so far, too, as my own powers, might have allowed. There are some
persons, however, who have the first four, or rather five, Books without
the prefaces, and the twelfth with no small part of its later chapters
omitted. But these, if they please and can, will amend the whole, if
they become acquainted with the present edition. At any rate, I have to
request that you will order this letter to be prefixed separately, but
at the beginning of the Books. Farewell. Pray for me.”
