<span id="v.viii.xix-p1"></span> 18. Whence also the just of old, before
the Incarnation of the Word, in this faith of Christ, and in this true
righteousness, (which thing Christ is unto us,) were justified;
believing this to come which we believe come: and they themselves by
grace were saved through faith, not of themselves, but by the gift of
God, not of works, lest haply they should be lifted up. <span
id="fr_2678"></span>[2679](#fn_2678) For their good works did not come
before God’s mercy, but followed it. For to them was it said, and by
them written, long ere Christ was come in the flesh, “I will have mercy
on whom I will have mercy, and I will show compassion on whom I will
have compassion.” <span id="fr_2679"></span>[2680](#fn_2679) From which
words of God the Apostle Paul, should so long after say; “It is not
therefore of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy.” It is also their own voice, long ere Christ was come in
the flesh, “My God, His mercy shall prevent me.” <span
id="fr_2680"></span>[2681](#fn_2680) How indeed could they be aliens
from the faith of Christ, by whose charity even Christ was
fore-announced unto us; without the faith of Whom, not any of mortals
either hath been, or is, or ever shall be able to be, righteous? If
then, being already just, the Apostles were elected by Christ, they
would have first chosen Him, that just men might be chosen, because
without Him they <span id="page_534">p. 534</span> <span
id="v.viii.xix-Page_534"></span>could not be just. But it was not so: as
Himself saith to them, “Not ye have chosen Me, but I have chosen you.”
Of which the Apostle John speaks, “Not that we loved God, but that He
loved us.” <span id="fr_2681"></span>[2682](#fn_2681)
