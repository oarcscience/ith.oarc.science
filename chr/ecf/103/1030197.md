<span id="iv.i.xv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—What in the Incarnate Word
Belongs to Knowledge, What to Wisdom.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xv.xix-p2"></span>24. And all these things which the Word
made flesh did and bare for us in time and place, belong, according to
the distinction which we have undertaken to demonstrate, to knowledge,
not to wisdom. And as the Word is without time and without place, it is
co-eternal with the Father, and in its wholeness everywhere; and if any
one can, and as much as he can, speak truly concerning this Word, then
his discourse will pertain to wisdom. And hence the Word made flesh,
which is Christ Jesus, has the treasures both of wisdom and of
knowledge. For the apostle, writing to the Colossians, says: “For I
would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at
Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the <span
id="page_181">p. 181</span> <span
id="iv.i.xv.xix-Page_181"></span>flesh; that their hearts might be
comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full
assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God
which is Christ Jesus: in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge.” <span id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842) To what extent the
apostle knew all those treasures, how much of them he had penetrated,
and in them to how great things he had reached, who can know? Yet, for
my part, according to that which is written, “But the manifestation of
the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal; for to one is given
by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by
the same Spirit;” <span id="fr_843"></span>[844](#fn_843) if these two
are in such way to be distinguished from each other, that wisdom is to
be assigned to divine things, knowledge to human, I acknowledge both in
Christ, and so with me do all His faithful ones. And when I read, “The
Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,” I understand by the Word the
true Son of God, I acknowledge in the flesh the true Son of man, and
both together joined into one Person of God and man, by an ineffable
copiousness of grace. And on account of this, the apostle goes on to
say, “And we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the
Father, full of grace and truth.” <span
id="fr_844"></span>[845](#fn_844) If we refer grace to knowledge, and
truth to wisdom, I think we shall not swerve from that distinction
between these two things which we have commended. For in those things
that have their origin in time, this is the highest grace, that man is
joined with God in unity of person; but in things eternal the highest
truth is rightly attributed to the Word of God. But that the same is
Himself the Only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth,—this
took place, in order that He Himself in things done for us in time
should be the same for whom we are cleansed by the same faith, that we
may contemplate Him steadfastly in things eternal. And those
distinguished philosophers of the heathen who have been able to
understand and discern the invisible things of God by those things which
are made, have yet, as is said of them, “held down the truth in
iniquity;” <span id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845) because they
philosophized without a Mediator, that is, without the man Christ, whom
they neither believed to be about to come at the word of the prophets,
nor to have come at that of the apostles. For, placed as they were in
these lowest things, they could not but seek some media through which
they might attain to those lofty things which they had understood; and
so they fell upon deceitful spirits, through whom it came to pass, that
“they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like
to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping
things.” <span id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846) For in such forms also
they set up or worshipped idols. Therefore Christ is our knowledge, and
the same Christ is also our wisdom. He Himself implants in us faith
concerning temporal things, He Himself shows forth the truth concerning
eternal things. Through Him we reach on to Himself: we stretch through
knowledge to wisdom; yet we do not withdraw from one and the same
Christ, “in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and of
knowledge.” But now we speak of knowledge, and will hereafter speak of
wisdom as much as He Himself shall grant. And let us not so take these
two things, as if it were not allowable to speak either of the wisdom
which is in human things, or of the knowledge which is in divine. For
after a laxer custom of speech, both can be called wisdom, and both
knowledge. Yet the apostle could not in any way have written, “To one is
given the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge,” except also
these several things had been properly called by the several names, of
the distinction between which we are now treating.
