id="iv.i.xvii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—The Infirmity of the Human
Mind.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xxiv-p2"></span>They, then, who see their own mind,
in whatever way that is possible, and in it that Trinity of which I have
treated as I could in many ways, and yet do not believe or understand it
to be an image of God, see indeed a glass, but do not so far see through
the glass Him who is now to be seen through the glass, that they do not
even know the glass itself which they see to be a glass, *i.e.* an
image. And if they knew this, perhaps they would feel that He too whose
glass this is, should by it be sought, and somehow provisionally be
seen, an unfeigned faith purging their hearts, <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040.md) that He who is now seen through a
glass may be able to be seen face to face. And if they despise this
faith that purifies the heart, what do they accomplish by understanding
the most subtle disputes concerning the nature of the human mind, unless
that they be condemned also by the witness of their own understanding?
And they would certainly not so fail in understanding, and hardly arrive
at anything certain, were they not involved in penal darkness, and
burdened with the corruptible body that presses down the soul. <span
id="fr_1041"></span>[1042](#fn_1041.md) And for what demerit save that of
sin is this evil inflicted on them? Wherefore, being warned by the
magnitude of so great an evil, they ought to follow the Lamb that taketh
away the sins of the world. <span id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042.md)
