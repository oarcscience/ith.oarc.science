<span id="v.i.xvii-p1"></span> 17. Now therefore let us return to that,
wherefore we have said what we have. We have need of Continence, and we
know it to be a divine gift, that our heart fall not away unto evil
words, to make excuses in sins. But what sin is there but that we have
need of Continence, to restrain it from being committed, since it is
this very Continence which, in case it have been committed, restrains it
from being defended by wicked pride? Universally therefore we have need
of Continence, in order to turn away from evil. But to do good seems to
pertain to another virtue, that is, to righteousness. <span
id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859) This the sacred Psalm admonishes
us, where we read, “Turn away from evil, and do good.” But with what end
we do this, it adds bye and bye, saying, <span id="page_386">p.
386</span> <span id="v.i.xvii-Page_386"></span>“Seek peace, and ensue
it.” <span id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860) For we shall then have
perfect peace, when, our nature cleaving inseparably to its Creator, we
shall have nothing of ourselves opposed to ourselves. This our Saviour
also Himself would have us to understand, so far as seems to me when He
said, “Let your loins be girt, and your lamps burning.” <span
id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861) What is it, to gird the loins? To
restrain lusts, which is the work of continence. But to have lamps
burning is to shine and glow with good works, which is the work of
righteousness. Nor was He here silent with what end we do these things,
adding and saying, “And you like unto men waiting for their Lord, when
He cometh from the marriage.” <span id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862)
But, when He shall have come, He will reward us, who have kept ourselves
from those things which lust, and have done those things which charity
hath bidden us: that we may reign in His perfect and eternal peace,
without any strife of evil, and with the highest delight of good.
