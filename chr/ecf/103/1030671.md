<span id="v.v.xxviii-p1"></span> 27. As, when we read in the Gospel,
“Thou hast received a blow in the face, make ready the other
cheek.” <span id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338.md) Now as an example of
patience can none be found than that of the Lord Himself more potent and
excellent; but He, when smitten on the cheek, said not, Behold here is
the other cheek, but He said, “If I have spoken ill, bear witness of the
evil; but if well, why smitest thou Me?” <span
id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339.md) Where He shows that the preparation
of the other cheek is to be done in the heart. Which also the Apostle
Paul knew, for he, too, when he was smitten on the face before the high
priest, did not say, Smite the other cheek: but, “God,” saith he, “shall
smite thee, thou whited wall: and sittest thou to judge me according to
law, and contrary to law commandest me to be smitten?” <span
id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340.md) with most deep insight beholding
that the priesthood of the Jews was already become such, that in name it
outwardly was clean and fair, but within was foul with muddy lusts;
which priesthood he saw in spirit to be ready to pass away through
vengeance of the Lord, when he spake those words: but yet he had his
heart ready not only to receive other blows on the cheek, but also to
suffer for the truth any torments whatever, with love of them from whom
he should suffer the same.
