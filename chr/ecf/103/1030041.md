<span id="iv.i.v-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv.i.v-p3"></span>The question is discussed with respect to
the appearances of God spoken of in the previous book, which were made
under bodily forms, whether only a creature was formed, for the purpose
of manifesting God to human sight in such way as He at each time judged
fitting; or whether angels, already existing, were so sent as to speak
in the person of God; and this, either by assuming a bodily appearance
from the bodily creature, or by changing their own bodies into whatever
forms they would, suitable to the particular action, according to the
power given to them by the Creator; while the essence itself of God was
never seen in itself.
