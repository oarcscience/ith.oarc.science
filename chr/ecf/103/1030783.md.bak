<span id="v.viii.ix-p1"></span> 8. But although patience be a virtue of
the mind, yet partly the mind exercises it in the mind itself, partly in
the body. In itself it exercises patience, when, the body remaining
unhurt and untouched, the mind is goaded by any adversities or
filthinesses of things or words, to do or to say something that is not
expedient or not becoming, and patiently bears all evils that it may not
itself commit any evil in work or word. By this patience we bear, even
while we be sound in body, that in the midst of the offenses of this
world our blessedness is deferred: of which is said what I cited a
little before, “If what we see not we hope for, we do by patience wait
for it.” By this patience, holy David bore the revilings of a
railer, <span id="fr_2637"></span>[2638](#fn_2637.md) and, when he might
easily have avenged himself, not only did it not, but even refrained
another who was vexed and moved for him; and more put forth his kingly
power by prohibiting than by exercising vengeance. Nor at that time was
his body afflicted with any disease or wound, but there was an
acknowledging of a time of humility, and a bearing of the will of God,
for the sake of which there was a drinking of the bitterness of
contumely with most patient mind. This patience the Lord taught, when,
the servants being moved at the mixing in of the tares and wishing to
gather them up, He said that the householder answered, “Leave both to
grow until the harvest.” <span id="fr_2638"></span>[2639](#fn_2638.md)
That, namely, must be patience put up with, which must not be in haste
put away. Of this patience Himself afforded and showed an example, when,
before the passion of His Body, He so bore with His disciple Judas, that
ere He pointed him out as the traitor, He endured him as a thief; <span
id="fr_2639"></span>[2640](#fn_2639.md) and before experience of bonds and
cross and death, did, to those lips so full of guile, not deny the kiss
of peace. <span id="fr_2640"></span>[2641](#fn_2640.md) All these, and
whatever else there be, which it were tedious to rehearse, belong to
that manner of patience, by which the mind doth, not its own sins but
any evils so ever from without, patiently endure in itself, while the
body remains altogether unhurt. But the other manner of patience is that
by which the same mind bears any troubles and grievances whatsoever in
the sufferings of the body; not as do foolish or wicked men for the sake
of getting vain things or perpetrating crimes; but as is defined by the
Lord, “for righteousness’ sake.” <span
id="fr_2641"></span>[2642](#fn_2641.md) In both kinds, the holy Martyrs
contended. For both with scornful reproofs of the ungodly were they
filled, where, the body remaining intact, the mind hath its own (as it
were) blows and wounds, and bears these unbroken: and in their bodies
they were bound, imprisoned, vexed with hunger and thirst, tortured,
gashed, torn asunder, burned, butchered; and with piety immovable
submitted unto <span id="page_530">p. 530</span> <span
id="v.viii.ix-Page_530"></span>God their mind, while they were suffering
in the flesh all that exquisite cruelty could devise in its mind.
