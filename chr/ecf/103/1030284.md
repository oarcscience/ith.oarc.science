<span id="iv.ii.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—The Ineffable Mystery of the
Birth of Christ the Mediator Through the Virgin Mary.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxxvi-p2"></span>Now of this Mediator it would occupy
too much space to say anything at all worthy of Him; and, indeed, to say
what is worthy of Him is not in the power of man. For who will explain
in consistent words this single statement, that “the Word was made
flesh, and dwelt among us,” <span id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145)
so that we may believe on the only Son of God the Father Almighty, born
of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary. The meaning of the Word being
made flesh, is not that the divine nature was changed into flesh, but
that the divine nature assumed our flesh. And by “flesh” we are here to
understand “man,” the part being put for the whole, as when it is said:
“By the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified,” <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146) that is, no man. For we must
believe that no part was wanting in that human nature which He put on,
save that it was a nature wholly free from every taint of sin,—not such
a nature as is conceived between the two sexes through carnal lust,
which is born in sin, and whose guilt is washed away in regeneration;
but such as it behoved a virgin to bring forth, when the mother’s faith,
not her lust, was the condition of conception. And if her virginity had
been marred even in bringing Him forth, He would not have been born of a
virgin; and it would be false (which God forbid) that He was born of the
Virgin Mary, as is believed and declared by the whole Church, which, in
imitation of His mother, daily brings forth members of His body, and yet
remains a virgin. Read, if you please, my letter on the virginity of the
holy Mary which I sent to that eminent man, whose name I mention with
respect and affection, Volusianus. <span
