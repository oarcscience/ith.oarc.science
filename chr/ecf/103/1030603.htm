<p class="c10"><a name="v.iii.l-p1"></A>  49. Wherefore also the virgins of God without blame indeed, &#8220;follow the Lamb whithersoever He shall have gone,&#8221; both the cleansing of sins being perfected, and virginity being kept, which, were it lost, could not return: but, because that same Apocalypse itself, wherein such unto one such were revealed, in this also praises them, that &#8220;in their mouth there was not found a lie:&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2204"></A><A HREF="#fn_2204"><FONT SIZE="1">2205</FONT></A>
 let them remember in this also to be true, that they dare not say that they have not sin. Forsooth the same John, who saw that, hath said this, &#8220;If we shall have said that we have not sin, we deceive our own selves, and the truth is not in us; but if we shall have confessed our faults, He is faithful and just, <A NAME="page_436"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 436</FONT></A> <a name="v.iii.l-Page_436"></A>so as to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. But if we shall have said that we have not sinned, we shall make Him a liar, and His word shall not be in us.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2205"></A><A HREF="#fn_2205"><FONT SIZE="1">2206</FONT></A>
 This surely is not said unto these or those, but unto all Christians, wherein virgins also ought to recognize themselves. For thus they shall be without a lie, such as in the Apocalypse they appeared. And by this means so long as there is not as yet perfection in heavenly height, confession in lowliness maketh them without blame.</p>
