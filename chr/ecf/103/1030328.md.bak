<span id="iv.ii.lxxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lxxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 78.—What Sins are Trivial and What
Heinous is a Matter for God’s Judgment.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxx-p2"></span>Now, what sins are trivial and what
heinous is not a matter to be decided by man’s judgment, but by the
judgment of God. For it is plain that the apostles themselves have given
an indulgence in the case of certain sins: take, for example, what the
Apostle Paul says to those who are married: “Defraud ye not one the
other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves
to fasting and prayer: and come together again, that <span
id="page_263">p. 263</span> <span id="iv.ii.lxxx-Page_263"></span>Satan
tempt you not for your incontinency.” <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249.md) Now it is possible that it might
not have been considered a sin to have intercourse with a spouse, not
with a view to the procreation of children, which is the great blessing
of marriage, but for the sake of carnal pleasure, and to save the
incontinent from being led by their weakness into the deadly sin of
fornication, or adultery, or another form of uncleanness which it is
shameful even to name, and into which it is possible that they might be
drawn by lust under the temptation of Satan. It is possible, I say, that
this might not have been considered a sin, had the apostle not added:
“But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.” <span
id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250.md) Who, then, can deny that it is a
sin, when confessedly it is only by apostolic authority that permission
is granted to those who do it? Another case of the same kind is where he
says: “Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law
before the unjust, and not before the saints?” <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251.md) And shortly afterwards: “If then ye
have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who
are least esteemed in the Church. I speak to your shame. Is it so, that
there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to
judge between his brethren? But brother goeth to law with brother, and
that before the unbelievers.” <span id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252.md)
Now it might have been supposed in this case that it is not a sin to
have a quarrel with another, that the only sin is in wishing to have it
adjudicated upon outside the Church, had not the apostle immediately
added: “Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go
to law with one another.” <span id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253.md) And
lest any one should excuse himself by saying that he had a just cause,
and was suffering wrong, and that he only wished the sentence of the
judges to remove his wrong, the apostle immediately anticipates such
thoughts and excuses, and says: “Why do ye not rather take wrong? Why do
ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?” Thus bringing us back
to our Lord’s saying, “If any man will sue thee at the law, and take
away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also;” <span
id="fr_1254"></span>[1255](#fn_1254.md) and again, “Of him that taketh away
thy goods, ask them not again.” <span
id="fr_1255"></span>[1256](#fn_1255.md) Therefore our Lord has forbidden
His followers to go to law with other men about worldly affairs. And
carrying out this principle, the apostle here declares that to do so is
“altogether a fault.” But when, notwithstanding, he grants his
permission to have such cases between brethren decided in the Church,
other brethren adjudicating, and only sternly forbids them to be carried
outside the Church, it is manifest that here again an indulgence is
extended to the infirmities of the weak. It is in view, then, of these
sins, and others of the same sort, and of others again more trifling
still, which consist of offenses in words and thought (as the Apostle
James confesses, “In many things we offend all” <span
id="fr_1256"></span>[1257](#fn_1256) .md), that we need to pray every day
and often to the Lord, saying, “Forgive us our debts,” and to add in
truth and sincerity, “as we forgive our debtors.”
