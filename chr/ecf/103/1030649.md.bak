<span id="v.v.vi-p1"></span> 5. But whether a lie be at some times
useful, is a much greater and more concerning question. Whether, as
above, it be a lie, when a person has no will to deceive, or even makes
it his business that the person to whom he says a thing shall not be
deceived although he did wish the thing itself which he uttered to be
false, but this on purpose that he might cause a truth to be believed;
whether, again, it be a lie when a person willingly utters even a truth
for the purpose of deceiving; this may be doubted. But none doubts that
it is a lie when a person willingly utters a falsehood for the purpose
of deceiving: wherefore a false utterance put forth with will to deceive
is manifestly a lie. But whether this alone be a lie, is another
question. Meanwhile, taking this kind of lie, in which all agree, let us
inquire, whether it be sometimes useful to utter a falsehood with will
to deceive. They who think it is, advance testimonies to their opinion,
by alleging the case of Sarah, <span
id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302.md) who, when she had laughed, denied
to the Angels that she laughed: of Jacob questioned by his father, and
answering that he was the elder son Esau: <span
id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303.md) likewise that of the Egyptian
midwives, who to save the Hebrew infants from being slain at their
birth, told a lie, and that with God’s approbation and reward: <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304.md) and many such like instances they
pick out, of lies told by persons whom you would not dare to blame, and
so must own that it may sometimes be not only not blameworthy, but even
praiseworthy to tell a lie. They add also a case with which to urge not
only those who are devoted to the Divine Books, but all men and common
sense, saying, Suppose a man should take refuge with thee, who by thy
lie might be saved from death, wouldest thou not tell it? If a sick man
should ask a question which it is not expedient that he should know, and
might be more grievously afflicted even by thy returning him no answer,
wilt thou venture either to tell the truth to the destruction of the
man’s life, or rather to hold thy peace, than by a virtuous and merciful
lie to be serviceable to his weak health? By these and such like
arguments they think they most plentifully prove, that if occasion of
doing good require, we may sometimes tell a lie.
