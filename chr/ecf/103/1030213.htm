<p class="c39"><a name="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p1"></A>  <span class="c2"><a name="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p1.1"></A>Chapter 14.&#8212;The Mind Loves God in Rightly Loving Itself; And If It Love Not God, It Must Be Said to Hate Itself. Even a Weak and Erring Mind is Always Strong in Remembering, Understanding, and Loving Itself. Let It Be Turned to God, that It May Be Blessed by Remembering, Understanding, and Loving Him.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p2"></A>18. But there are yet more testimonies in the divine Scriptures concerning the love of God. For in it, those other two [namely, memory and understanding] are understood by consequence, inasmuch as no one loves that which he does not remember, or of which he is wholly ignorant. And hence is that well known and primary commandment, &#8220;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_890"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">891</FONT></A>
 The human mind, then, is so constituted, that at no time does it not remember, and understand, and love itself. But since he who hates any one is anxious to injure him, not undeservedly is the mind of man also said to hate itself when it injures itself. For it wills ill to itself through ignorance, in that it does not think that what it wills is prejudicial to it; but it none the less does will ill to itself, when it wills what would be prejudicial to it. And hence it is written, &#8220;He that loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_891"></A><A HREF="#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">892</FONT></A>
 He, therefore, who knows how to love himself, loves God; but <A NAME="page_193"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 193</FONT></A> <a name="iv.i.xvi.xiv-Page_193"></A>he who does not love God, even if he does love himself,&#8212;a thing implanted in him by nature,&#8212;yet is not unsuitably said to hate himself, inasmuch as he does that which is adverse to himself, and assails himself as though he were his own enemy. And this is no doubt a terrible delusion, that whereas all will to profit themselves, many do nothing but that which is most pernicious to themselves. When the poet was describing a like disease of dumb animals, &#8220;May the gods,&#8221; says he, &#8220;grant better things to the pious, and assign that delusion to enemies. They were rending with bare teeth their own torn limbs.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_892"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">893</FONT></A>
 Since it was a disease of the body he was speaking of, why has he called it a delusion, unless because, while nature inclines every animal to take all the care it can of itself, that disease was such that those animals rent those very limbs of theirs which they desired should be safe and sound? But when the mind loves God, and by consequence, as has been said remembers and understands Him, then it is rightly enjoined also to love its neighbor as itself; for it has now come to love itself rightly and not perversely when it loves God, by partaking of whom that image not only exists, but is also renewed so as to be no longer old, and restored so as to be no longer defaced, and beatified so as to be no longer unhappy. For although it so love itself, that, supposing the alternative to be proposed to it, it would lose all things which it loves less than itself rather than perish; still, by abandoning Him who is above it, in dependence upon whom alone it could guard its own strength, and enjoy Him as its light, to whom it is sung in the Psalm, &#8220;I will guard my strength in dependence upon Thee,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">894</FONT></A>
 and again, &#8220;Draw near to Him, and be enlightened,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">895</FONT></A>
&#8212;it has been made so weak and so dark, that it has fallen away unhappily from itself too, to those things that are not what itself is, and which are beneath itself, by affections that it cannot conquer, and delusions from which it sees no way to return. And hence, when by God&#146;s mercy now penitent, it cries out in the Psalms, &#8220;My strength faileth me; as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">896</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p9"></A>19. Yet, in the midst of these evils of weakness and delusion, great as they are, it could not lose its natural memory, understanding and love of itself. And therefore what I quoted above&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">897</FONT></A>
 can be rightly said, &#8220;Although man walketh in an image, surely he is disquieted in vain: he heapeth up treasures, and knoweth not who shall gather them.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">898</FONT></A>
 For why does he heap up treasures, unless because his strength has deserted him, through which he would have God, and so lack nothing? And why cannot he tell for whom he shall gather them, unless because the light of his eyes is taken from him? And so he does not see what the Truth saith, &#8220;Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee. Then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">899</FONT></A>
 Yet because even such a man walketh in an image, and the man&#146;s mind has remembrance, understanding, and love of itself; if it were made plain to it that it could not have both, while it was permitted to choose one and lose the other, <i>viz</i>. either the treasures it has heaped up, or the mind; who is so utterly without mind, as to prefer to have the treasures rather than the mind? For treasures commonly are able to subvert the mind, but the mind that is not subverted by treasures can live more easily and unencumberedly without any treasures. But who will be able to possess treasures unless it be by means of the mind? For if an infant, born as rich as you please, although lord of everything that is rightfully his, yet possesses nothing if his mind be unconscious, how can any one possibly possess anything whose mind is wholly lost? But why say of treasures, that anybody, if the choice be given him, prefers going without them to going without a mind; when there is no one that prefers, nay, no one that compares them, to those lights of the body, by which not one man only here and there, as in the case of gold, but every man, possesses the very heaven? For every one possesses by the eyes of the body whatever he gladly sees. Who then is there, who, if he could not keep both, but must lose one, would not rather lose his treasures than his eyes? And yet if it were put to him on the same condition, whether he would rather lose eyes than mind, who is there with a mind that does not see that he would rather lose the former than the latter? For a mind without the eyes of the flesh is still human, but the eyes of the flesh without a mind are bestial. And who would not rather be a man, even though blind in fleshly sight, than a beast that can see?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p13"></A>20. I have said thus much, that even those who are slower of understanding, to whose eyes or ears this book may come, might be admonished, however briefly, how greatly even a weak and erring mind loves itself, in wrongly loving and pursuing things beneath itself. Now it could not love itself if it <A NAME="page_194"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 194</FONT></A> <a name="iv.i.xvi.xiv-Page_194"></A>were altogether ignorant of itself, <i>i.e.</i> if it did not remember itself, nor understand itself by which image of God within itself it has such power as to be able to cleave to Him whose image it is. For it is so reckoned in the order, not of place, but of natures, as that there is none above it save Him. When, finally, it shall altogether cleave to Him, then it will be one spirit, as the apostle testifies, saying, &#8220;But he who cleaves to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_899"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">900</FONT></A>
 And this by its drawing near to partake of His nature, truth, and blessedness, yet not by His increasing in His own nature, truth and blessedness. In that nature, then, when it happily has cleaved to it, it will live unchangeably, and will see as unchangeable all that it does see. Then, as divine Scripture promises, &#8220;His desire will be satisfied with good things,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">901</FONT></A>
 good things unchangeable,&#8212;the very Trinity itself, its own God, whose image it is. And that it may not ever thenceforward suffer wrong, it will be in the hidden place of His presence,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">902</FONT></A>
 filled with so great fullness of Him, that sin thenceforth will never delight it. But now, when it sees itself, it sees something not unchangeable.</p>
