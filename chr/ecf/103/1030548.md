<span id="v.ii.xxxii-p1"></span> 31. From this obedience that Father,
who was not without a wife, was prepared to be without an only
son, <span id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015.md) and that slain by
himself. For I shall not without due cause call him an only son,
concerning whom he heard the Lord say, “In Isaac shall there be called
for thee a seed. <span id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016.md) ” Therefore
how much sooner would he hear it, that he should be even without a wife,
if this he were bidden? Wherefore it is not without reason that we often
consider, that some of both sexes, containing from all sexual
intercourse, are negligent in obeying precepts, after having with so
great warmth caught at the not making use of things that are allowed.
Whence who doubts that we do not rightly compare unto the excellence of
those holy fathers and mothers begetting sons, the men and women of our
time, although free from all intercourse, yet in virtue of obedience
inferior: even if there had been wanting to those men in habit of mind
also, what is plain in the deed of the latter. Therefore let these
follow the Lamb, boys singing the new song, as it is written in the
Apocalypse, “who have not defiled themselves with women:” <span
id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017.md) for no other reason than that they
have continued virgins. Nor let them on this account think themselves
better than the first holy fathers, who used marriage, so to speak,
after the fashion of marriage. Forsooth the use of it is such, as that,
if in it there hath taken place through carnal intercourse aught which
exceeds necessity of begetting, although in a way that deserves pardon,
there is pollution. For what doth pardon expiate, if that advance cause
no pollution whatever? From which pollution it were strange if boys
following the Lamb were free, unless they continued virgins.
