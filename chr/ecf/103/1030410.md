<span id="iv.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—Of Christ’s Session at the
Father’s Right Hand.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p2"></span>14. We believe also that <span
class="c19"><span id="iv.iv.viii-p2.1"></span>He Sitteth at the Right
Hand of the Father</span>. This, however, is <span id="page_327">p.
327</span> <span id="iv.iv.viii-Page_327"></span>not to lead us to
suppose that God the Father is, as it were, circumscribed by a human
form, so that, when we think of Him, a right side or a left should
suggest itself to the mind. Nor, again, when it is thus said in express
terms that the Father sitteth, are we to fancy that this is done with
bended knees; lest we should fall into that profanity, in \[dealing
with\] which an apostle execrates those who “changed the glory of the
incorruptible God into the likeness of corruptible man.” <span
id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581.md) For it is unlawful for a Christian
to set up any such image for God in a temple; much more nefarious is it,
\[therefore\], to set it up in the heart, in which truly is the temple
of God, provided it be purged of earthly lust and error. This
expression, “at the right hand,” therefore, we must understand to
signify a position in supremest blessedness, where righteousness and
peace and joy are; just as the kids are set on the left hand, <span
id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582.md) that is to say, in misery, by
reason of unrighteousness, labors, and torments. <span
id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583.md) And in accordance with this, when
it is said that God “sitteth,” the expression indicates not a posture of
the members, but a judicial power, which that Majesty never fails to
possess, as He is always awarding deserts as men deserve them (*digna
dignis tribuendo*); although at the last judgment the unquestionable
brightness of the only-begotten Son of God, the Judge of the living and
the dead, is destined yet to be <span
id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584.md) a thing much more manifest among
men.
