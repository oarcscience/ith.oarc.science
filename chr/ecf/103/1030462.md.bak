<span id="iv.vi.xxxvi-p1"></span> 35. But any habits whatever have so
great power to hold possession of men’s minds, that even what in them
are evil, which usually takes place through excess of lusts, we can
sooner disapprove of and hate, than desert or change. Do you think that
little hath been done for the benefit of man, that not some few very
learned men maintain by argument, but also an unlearned crowd of males
and females in so many and different nations both believe and set forth,
that we are to worship as God nothing of earth, nothing of fire,
nothing, lastly, which comes into contact with the senses of the body,
but that we are to seek to approach Him by the understanding only? that
abstinence is extended even unto the slenderest food of bread and water,
and fastings not only for the day, <span
id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754.md) but also continued through several
days together; that chastity is carried even unto the contempt of
marriage and family; that patience even unto the setting light by
crosses and flames; that liberality even unto the distribution of
estates unto the poor; that, lastly, the contempt of this whole world
even unto the desire of death? Few do these things, yet fewer do them
well and wisely: but whole nations approve, nations hear, nations favor,
nations, lastly, love. Nations accuse their own weakness that they
cannot do these things, and that not without the mind being carried
forward unto God, nor without certain sparks of virtue. This hath been
brought to pass by the Divine Providence, through the prophecies of the
Prophets, through the manhood and teaching of Christ, through the
journeys of the Apostles, through the insults, crosses, blood, of the
Martyrs, through the praiseworthy life of the Saints, and, in all these,
<span id="page_365">p. 365</span> <span
id="iv.vi.xxxvi-Page_365"></span>according as times were seasonable,
through miracles worthy of so great matters and virtues. When therefore
we see so great help of God, so great progress and fruit, shall we doubt
to hide ourselves in the bosom of that Church, which even unto the
confession of the human race from \[the\] apostolic chair <span
id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755.md) through successions of
Bishops, <span id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756.md) (heretics in vain
lurking around her and being condemned, partly by the judgment of the
very people, partly by the weight of councils, partly also by the
majesty of miracles,) hath held the summit of authority. To be unwilling
to grant to her the first place, <span
id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757.md) is either surely the height of
impiety, or is headlong arrogance. For, if there be no sure way unto
wisdom and health of souls, unless where faith prepare them for reason,
what else is it to be ungrateful for the Divine help and aid, than to
wish to resist authority furnished with so great labor? <span
id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758.md) And if every system of teaching,
however mean and easy, requires, in order to its being received, a
teacher or master, what more full of rash pride, than, in the case of
books of divine mysteries, <span id="fr_1759"></span>[1760](#fn_1759.md)
both to be unwilling to learn from such as interpret them, and to wish
to condemn them unlearned?
