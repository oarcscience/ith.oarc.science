<span id="v.iv.iii-p1"></span> 2. Whereas, therefore, in every question,
which relates to life and conduct, not only teaching, but exhortation
also is necessary; <span id="page_442">p. 442</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii-Page_442"></span>in order that by teaching we may know what
is to be done, and by exhortation may be incited not to think it irksome
to do what we already know is to be done; what more can I teach you,
than what we read in the Apostle? For holy Scripture setteth a rule to
our teaching, that we dare not “be wise more than it behoveth to be
wise;” <span id="fr_2219"></span>[2220](#fn_2219.md) but be wise, as
himself saith, “unto soberness, according as unto each God hath allotted
the measure of faith.” <span id="fr_2220"></span>[2221](#fn_2220.md) Be it
not therefore for me to teach you any other thing, save to expound to
you the words of the Teacher, and to treat of them as the Lord shall
have given to me.
