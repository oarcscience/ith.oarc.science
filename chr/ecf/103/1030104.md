<span id="iv.i.viii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.viii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Of the Attributes Assigned by
Hilary to Each Person. The Trinity is Represented in Things that are
Made.</span>

<span id="iv.i.viii.x-p2"></span>11. A certain writer, when he would
briefly intimate the special attributes of each of the persons in the
Trinity, tells us that “Eternity is in the Father, form in the Image,
use in the Gift.” And since he was a man of no mean authority in
handling the Scriptures, and in the assertion of the faith, for it is
Hilary who put this in his book (*On the Trinity, ii.*); I have searched
into the hidden meaning of these words as far as I can, that is, of the
Father, and the Image, and the Gift, of eternity, and of form, and of
use. And I do not think that he intended more by the word eter<span
id="page_103">p. 103</span> <span id="iv.i.viii.x-Page_103"></span>nity,
than that the Father has not a father from whom He is; but the Son is
from the Father, so as to be, and so as to be co-eternal with Him. For
if an image perfectly fills the measure of that of which it is the
image, then the image is made equal to that of which it is the image,
not the latter to its own image. And in respect to this image he has
named form, I believe on account of the quality of beauty, where there
is at once such great fitness, and prime equality, and prime likeness,
differing in nothing, and unequal in no respect, and in no part unlike,
but answering exactly to Him whose image it is: where there is prime and
absolute life, to whom it is not one thing to live, and another to be,
but the same thing to be and to live; and prime and absolute intellect,
to whom it is not one thing to live, another to understand, but to
understand is to live, and is to be, and all things are one: as though a
perfect Word ([John 1.1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.i.viii.x-p2.1"></span>[John i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)<span id="iv.i.viii.x-p2.2"></span>.md),
to which nothing is wanting, and a certain skill of the omnipotent and
wise God, full of all living, unchangeable sciences, and all one in it,
as itself is one from one, with whom it is one. Therein God knew all
things which He made by it; and therefore, while times pass away and
succeed, nothing passes away or succeeds to the knowledge of God. For
things which are created are not therefore known by God, because they
have been made; and not rather have been therefore made, even although
changeable, because they are known unchangeably by Him. Therefore that
unspeakable conjunction of the Father and His image is not without
fruition, without love, without joy. Therefore that love, delight,
felicity, or blessedness, if indeed it can be worthily expressed by any
human word, is called by him, in short, Use; and is the Holy Spirit in
the Trinity, not begotten, but the sweetness of the begetter and of the
begotten, filling all creatures according to their capacity with
abundant bountifulness and copiousness, that they may keep their proper
order and rest satisfied in their proper place.

<span id="iv.i.viii.x-p3"></span>12. Therefore all these things which
are made by divine skill, show in themselves a certain unity, and form,
and order; for each of them is both some one thing, as are the several
natures of bodies and dispositions of souls; and is fashioned in some
form, as are the figures or qualities of bodies, and the various
learning or skill of souls; and seeks or preserves a certain order, as
are the several weights or combinations of bodies and the loves or
delights of souls. When therefore we regard the Creator, who is
understood by the things that are made <span
id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623.md) we must needs understand the Trinity
of whom there appear traces in the creature, as is fitting. For in that
Trinity is the supreme source of all things, and the most perfect
beauty, and the most blessed delight. Those three, therefore, both seem
to be mutually determined to each other, and are in themselves infinite.
But here in corporeal things, one thing alone is not as much as three
together, and two are something more than one; but in that highest
Trinity one is as much as the three together, nor are two anything more
than one. And They are infinite in themselves. So both each are in each,
and all in each, and each in all, and all in all, and all are one. Let
him who sees this, whether in part, or “through a glass and in an
enigma,” <span id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624.md) rejoice in knowing God;
and let him honor Him as God, and give thanks; but let him who does not
see it, strive to see it through piety, not to cavil at it through
blindness. Since God is one, but yet is a Trinity. Neither are we to
take the words, “of whom, and through whom, and to whom are all things,”
as used indiscriminately \[*i.e.,* to denote a unity without
distinctions\]; nor yet to denote many gods, for “to *Him*, be glory for
ever and ever. Amen.” <span id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625.md)
