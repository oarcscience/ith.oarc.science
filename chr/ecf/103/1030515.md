<span id="v.i.xxxii-p1"></span> 32. But whether keenly contending, that
we be not overcome, or overcoming divers times, or even with unhoped and
unlooked for ease, let us give the glory unto Him Who giveth continence
unto us. Let us remember that a certain just man said, “I shall never be
moved:” and that it was showed him how rashly he had said this,
attributing as though to his own strength, what was given to him from
above. But this we have learnt from his own confession: for soon after
he added, “Lord, in Thy will Thou hast given strength to my beauty; but
Thou hast turned away Thy Face, and I was troubled.” <span
id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930.md) Through a remedial Providence he
was for a short time deserted by his Ruler, in order that he might not
himself through deadly pride desert his Ruler. Therefore, whether here,
where we engage with our faults in order to subdue and make them less,
or there, as it shall be in the end, where we shall be void of every
enemy, because of all infection, <span
id="fr_1931"></span>[1932](#fn_1931.md) it is for our health that we are
thus dealt with, in order that, “whoso glorieth, he may glory in the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932.md)
