<span id="iv.i.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—A Doubt Raised About Divine
Appearances.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.viii-p2"></span>12. The Holy Spirit, then, is also
said to be sent, on account of these corporeal forms which came into
existence in time, in order to signify and manifest Him, as He must
needs be manifested, to human senses; yet He is not said to be less than
the Father, as the Son, because He was in the form of a servant, is said
to be; because that form of a servant inhered in the unity of the person
of the Son, but those corporeal forms appeared for a time, in order to
show what was necessary to be shown, and then ceased to be. Why, then,
is not the Father also said to be sent, through those corporeal forms,
the fire of the bush, and the pillar of cloud or of fire, and the
lightnings in the mount, and whatever other things of the kind appeared
at that time, when (as we have learned from Scripture testimony) He
spake face to face with the fathers, if He Himself was manifested by
those modes and forms of the creature, as exhibited and presented
corporeally to human sight? But if the Son was manifested by them, why
is He said to be sent so long after, when He was made of a woman, as the
apostle says, “But when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth
His Son, made of a woman,” <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md)
seeing that He was sent also before, when He appeared to the fathers by
those changeable forms of the creature? Or if He cannot rightly be said
to be sent, unless when the Word was made flesh, why is the Holy Spirit
said to be sent, of whom no such incarnation was ever wrought? But if by
those visible things, which are put before us in the Law and in the
prophets, neither the Father nor the Son but the Holy Spirit was
manifested, why also is He said to be sent now, when He was sent also
before after these modes?

<span id="iv.i.iv.viii-p4"></span>13. In the perplexity of this inquiry,
the Lord helping us, we must ask, first, whether the Father, or the Son,
or the Holy Spirit; or whether, sometimes the Father, sometimes the Son,
sometimes the Holy Spirit; or whether it was without any distinction of
persons, in such way as the one and only God is spoken of, that is, that
the Trinity itself appeared to the Fathers by those forms of the
creature. Next, whichever of these alternatives shall have been found or
thought true, whether for this purpose only the creature was fashioned,
wherein God, as He judged it suitable at that time, should be shown to
human sight; or whether angels, who already existed, were so sent, as to
speak in the person of God, taking a corporeal form from the corporeal
creature, for the purpose of their ministry, as each had need; or else,
according to the power the Creator has given them, changing and
converting their own body itself, to which they are not subject, but
govern it as subject to themselves, into whatever appearances they would
that were suited and apt to their several actions. Lastly, we shall
discern that which it was our purpose to ask, *viz*. whether the Son and
the Holy Spirit were also sent before; and, if they were so sent, what
difference there is between that sending, and the one which we read of
in the Gospel; or whether in truth neither of them were sent, except
when either the Son was made of the Virgin Mary, or the Holy Spirit
appeared in a visible form, whether in the dove or in tongues of fire.
