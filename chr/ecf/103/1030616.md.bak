<span id="v.iv.iv-p1"></span> 3. Therefore (thus) saith the Apostle, the
teacher of the Gentiles, the vessel of election, “But I say unto the
unmarried and the widows, that it is good for them, if they shall have
so continued, even as I also.” <span
id="fr_2221"></span>[2222](#fn_2221.md) These words are to be so
understood, as that we think not that widows ought not to be called
unmarried, in that they seem to have made trial of marriage: for by the
name of unmarried women he means those, who are not now bound by
marriage, whether they have been, or whether they have not been so. And
this in another place he opens, where he says, “Divided is a woman
unmarried and a virgin.” <span id="fr_2222"></span>[2223](#fn_2222.md)
Assuredly when he adds a virgin also, what would he have understood by
an unmarried woman, but a widow? Whence also, in what follows, under the
one term “unmarried” he embraces both professions, saying, “She who is
unmarried is careful of the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord:
but she who is married is careful of the things of the world, how to
please her husband.” <span id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223.md)
Certainly by the unmarried he would have understood, not only her who
hath never married, but her also, who, being by widowhood set free from
the bond of marriage, hath ceased to be married; for on this account
also he calleth not married, save her, who hath an husband; not her
also, who hath had, and hath not. Wherefore every widow is unmarried;
but, because not every unmarried woman is a widow, for there are virgins
also; therefore he hath here set both, where he says, “But I say unto
the unmarried and the widows;” as if he should say, What I say unto the
unmarried, I say not unto them alone, who are virgins, but unto them
also who are widows; “that it is good for them, if they shall have so
continued, even as also I.” <span id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224.md)
