id="iv.ii.cvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 105.—Man Was So Created as to Be
Able to Choose Either Good or Evil: in the Future Life, the Choice of
Evil Will Be Impossible.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cvii-p2"></span>Now it was expedient that man should be
at first so created, as to have it in his power both to will what was
right and to will what was wrong; not without reward if he willed the
former, and not without punishment if he willed the latter. But in the
future life it shall not be in his power to will evil; and yet this will
constitute no restriction on the freedom of his will. On the contrary,
his will shall be much freer when it shall be wholly impossible for him
to be the slave of sin. We should never think of blaming the will, or
saying that it was no will, or that it was not to be called free, when
we so desire happiness, that not only do we shrink from misery, but find
it utterly impossible to do otherwise. As, then, the soul even now finds
it impossible to desire unhappiness, so in future it shall be wholly
impossible for it to desire sin. But God’s arrangement was not to be
broken, according to which He willed to show how good is a rational
being who is able even to refrain from sin, and yet how much better is
one who cannot sin at all; just as that was an inferior sort of
immortality, and yet it was immortality, when it was possible for man to
avoid death, although there is reserved for the future a more perfect
immortality, when it shall be impossible for man to die.
