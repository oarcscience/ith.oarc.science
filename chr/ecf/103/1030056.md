<span id="iv.i.vi.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—We are Made Perfect by
Acknowledgement of Our Own Weakness. The Incarnate Word Dispels Our
Darkness.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vi.ii-p2"></span>2. But since we are exiled from the
unchangeable joy, yet neither cut off nor torn away from it so that we
should not seek eternity, truth, blessedness, even in those changeable
and temporal things (for we wish neither to die, nor to be deceived, nor
to be troubled); visions have been sent to us from heaven suitable to
our state of pilgrimage, in order to remind us that what we seek is not
here, but that from this pilgrimage we must return thither, whence
unless we originated we should not here seek these things. And first we
have had to be persuaded how much God loved us, lest from despair we
should not dare to look up to Him. And we needed to be shown also what
manner of men we are whom He loved, lest being proud, as if of our own
merits, we should recede the more from Him, and fail the more in our own
strength. And hence He so dealt with us, that we might the rather profit
by His strength, and that so in the weakness of humility the virtue of
charity might be perfected. And this is intimated in the Psalm, where it
is said, “Thou, O God, didst send a spontaneous rain, whereby Thou didst
make Thine inheritance perfect, when it was weary.” <span
id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md) For by “spontaneous rain” nothing else
is meant than grace, not rendered to merit, but given freely, <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442.md) whence also it is called grace; for He
gave it, not because we were worthy, but because He willed. And knowing
this, we shall not trust in ourselves; and this is to be made “weak.”
But He Himself makes us perfect, who says also to the Apostle Paul, “My
grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in
weakness.” <span id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md) Man, then, was to be
persuaded how much God loved us, and what manner of men we were whom He
loved; the former, lest we should despair; the latter, lest we should be
proud. And this most necessary topic the apostle thus explains: “But God
commendeth,” he says, “His love towards us, in that, while we were yet
sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by His
blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For if, when we were
enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son; much more,
being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.” <span
id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) Also in another place: “What,” he
says, “shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be
against us? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us
all, how has He not with Him also freely given us all things?” <span
id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) Now that which is declared to us as
already done, was shown also to the ancient righteous as about to be
done; that through the same faith they themselves also might be humbled,
and so made weak; and might be made weak, and so perfected.

<span id="iv.i.vi.ii-p8"></span>3. Because therefore the Word of God is
One, by which all things were made, which is the unchangeable truth, all
things are simultaneously therein, potentially and unchangeably; not
only those things which are now in this whole creation, but also those
which have been and those which shall be. And therein they neither have
been, nor shall be, but only *are*; and all things are life, and all
things are one; or rather it is one being and one life. For all things
were so made by Him, that whatsoever was made in them was not made in
Him, but was life in Him. Since, “in the beginning,” the Word was not
made, but “the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and all things
were made by Him;” neither had all things been made by Him, unless He
had Himself been before all things and not made. But in those things
which were made by Him, even body, which is not life, would not have
been made by Him, except it had been life in Him before it was made. For
“that which was made was already life in Him;” and not life of any kind
soever: for the soul also is the life of the body, but this too is made,
for it is <span id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span
id="iv.i.vi.ii-Page_71"></span>changeable; and by what was it made,
except by the unchangeable Word of God? For “all things were made by
Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made.” “What,
therefore, was made was already life in Him;” and not any kind of life,
but “the life \[which\] was the light of men;” the light certainly of
rational minds, by which men differ from beasts, and therefore are men.
Therefore not corporeal light, which is the light of the flesh, whether
it shine from heaven, or whether it be lighted by earthly fires; nor
that of human flesh only, but also that of beasts, and down even to the
minutest of worms. For all these things see that light: but that life
was the light of men; nor is it far from any one of us, for in it “we
live, and move, and have our being.” <span
