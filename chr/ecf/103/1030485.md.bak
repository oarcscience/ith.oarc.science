<span id="v.i.ii-p1"></span> 2. And lest it should seem that necessary
Continence was to be hoped for from the Lord only in respect of the lust
of the lower parts of the flesh, it is also sung in the Psalm; “Set, O
Lord, a watch to my mouth, and a door of Continence around my
lips.” <span id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809.md) But in this witness of
the divine speech, if we understand “mouth” as we ought to understand
it, we perceive how great a gift of God Continence there set is.
Forsooth it is little to contain the mouth of the body, lest any thing
burst forth thence, which is not for the better, through the sound of
the voice. For there is, within, the mouth of the heart, where he, who
spake these words, and wrote them for us to speak, desired of the Lord
that the watch and door of Continence should be set for him. For many
things we say not with the mouth of the body, and cry aloud with the
heart: but there goes forth from the mouth of the body no word of any
thing, whereof there is silence in the heart. Therefore what flows not
forth thence, sounds not abroad: but what flows forth thence, if it be
<span id="page_380">p. 380</span> <span
id="v.i.ii-Page_380"></span>evil, although it move not the tongue,
defiles the soul. Therefore Continence must be set there, where the
conscience even of them who are silent speaks. For it is brought to pass
by means of the door of Continence, that there go not forth thence that,
which, even when the lips of the flesh are closed, pollutes the life of
him that hath the thought.
