<span id="v.vi.xxvii-p1"></span> 26. To show then that some things in
the Scriptures which are thought to be lies are not what they are
thought, if they be rightly understood, let it not seem to thee to tell
little against them, that it is not from Apostolic but from Prophetical
books that they find as it were precedents of lying. For all those which
they mention by name, in which each lied, are read in those books in
which not only words but many deeds of a figurative meaning are
recorded, because it was also in a figurative sense that they were done.
But in figures that which is spoken as a seeming lie, being well
understood, is found to be a truth. The Apostles, however, in their
Epistles spoke in another sort, and in another sort are written the Acts
of the Apostles, to wit, because now the New Testament was revealed,
which was veiled in those prophetic figures. In short, in all those
Apostolic Epistles, and in that large book in which their acts are
narrated with canonical truth, we do not find any person lying, such
that from him a precedent can be set forth by these men for license of
lying. For that simulation of Peter and Barnabas with which they were
compelling the Gentiles to Judaize, was deservedly reprehended and set
right, both that it might not do harm at the time, and that it might not
weigh with posterity as a thing to be imitated. For when the Apostle
Paul saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the
Gospel, he said to Peter in the presence of them all, “If thou, being a
Jew, livest as the Gentiles; and not as do the Jews, how compellest thou
the Gentiles to Judaize?” <span id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425.md) But
in that which himself did, to the intent that by retaining and acting
upon certain observances of the law after the Jewish custom he might
show that he was no enemy to the Law and to the Prophets, far be it from
us to believe that he did so as a liar. As indeed concerning this matter
his sentence is sufficiently well known, whereby it was settled that
neither Jews who then believed in Christ were to be prohibited from the
traditions of their fathers, nor Gentiles when they became Christians to
be compelled thereunto: in order that those sacred rites <span
id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426.md) which were well known to have been
of God enjoined, should not be shunned as sacrileges; nor yet accounted
so necessary, now that the New Testament was revealed, as though without
them whoso should be converted unto God, could not be saved. For there
were some who thought so and preached, albeit after Christ’s Gospel
received; and to these had feignedly consented both Peter and Barnabas,
and so were compelling the Gentiles to Judaize. For it was a compelling,
to preach them to be so necessary as if, even after the Gospel received,
without them were no salvation in Christ. This the error of certain did
suppose, this Peter’s fear did feign, this Paul’s liberty did beat down.
What therefore he saith, “I am made all things to all, that I might gain
all,” <span id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427.md) that did he, by
suffering with others, not by lying. For each becomes as though he were
that person whom he would fain succor, when he succoreth with the same
pity wherewith he would wish himself to be succored, if himself were set
in the same misery. Therefore he becomes as though he were that person,
not for that he deceives him, but for that he thinks himself as him.
Whence is that of the Apostle, which I have before rehearsed, “Brethren,
if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an
one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest thou also be
tempted.” <span id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428.md) For if, because he
said, “To the Jews became I as a Jew, and to them which were under the
law as under the law,” <span id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429.md) he is
therefore to be accounted to have in a lying manner taken up the
sacraments of the old law, he ought in the same manner to have taken up,
in a lying way, the idolatry of the Gentiles, because he hath said that
to them which were without law he became as without law; which thing in
any wise he did not. For he did not any where sacrifice to idols or
adore those figments and not rather freely as a martyr of Christ show
that they were to be detested and eschewed. From no apostolic acts or
speeches, there<span id="page_494">p. 494</span> <span
id="v.vi.xxvii-Page_494"></span>fore, do these men allege things meet
for imitation as examples of lying. From prophetical deeds or words,
then, the reason why they seem to themselves to have what they may
allege, is only for that they take figures prenunciative to be lies,
because they are sometimes like unto lies. But when they are referred to
those things for the signifying of which they were so done or said, they
are found to be significations full of truth, and therefore in no wise
to be lies. A lie, namely, is a false signification with will of
deceiving. But that is no false signification, where, although one thing
is signified by another, yet the thing signified is a true thing, if it
be rightly understood.
