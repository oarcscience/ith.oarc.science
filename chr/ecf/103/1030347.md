<span id="iv.ii.xcix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xcix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 97.—In What Sense Does the Apostle
Say that “God Will Have All Men to Be Saved,” When, as a Matter of Fact,
All are Not Saved?</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xcix-p2"></span>Hence we must inquire in what sense is
said of God what the apostle has mostly truly said: “Who will have all
men to be saved.” <span id="fr_1276"></span>[1277](#fn_1276) For, as a
matter of fact, not all, nor even a majority, are saved: so that it
would seem that what God wills is not done, man’s will interfering with,
and hindering the will of God. When we ask the reason why all men are
not saved, the ordinary answer is: “Because men <span id="page_268">p.
268</span> <span id="iv.ii.xcix-Page_268"></span>themselves are not
willing.” This, indeed cannot be said of infants, for it is not in their
power either to will or not to will. But if we could attribute to their
will the childish movements they make at baptism, when they make all the
resistance they can, we should say that even they are not willing to be
saved. Our Lord says plainly, however, in the Gospel, when upbraiding
the impious city: “How often would I have gathered thy children
together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye
would not!” <span id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277) as if the will of
God had been overcome by the will of men, and when the weakest stood in
the way with their want of will, the will of the strongest could not be
carried out. And where is that omnipotence which hath done all that it
pleased on earth and in heaven, if God willed to gather together the
children of Jerusalem, and did not accomplish it? or rather, Jerusalem
was not willing that her children should be gathered together? But even
though she was unwilling, He gathered together as many of her children
as He wished: for He does not will some things and do them, and will
others and do them not; but “He hath done all that He pleased in heaven
and in earth.”
