<span id="iv.i.xv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—Faith a Thing of the Heart, Not
of the Body; How It is Common and One and the Same in All Believers. The
Faith of Believers is One, No Otherwise than the Will of Those Who Will
is One.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xv.ii-p2"></span>5. But faith, of which we are compelled,
by reason of the arrangement of our subject, to dispute somewhat more at
length in this book: faith I say, which they who have are called the
faithful, and they who have not, unbelievers, as were those who did not
receive the Son of God coming to His own; although it is wrought in us
by hearing, yet does not belong to that sense of the body which is
called hearing, since it is not a sound; nor to the eyes of this our
flesh, since it is neither color nor bodily form; nor to that which is
called touch, since it has nothing of bulk; nor to any sense of the body
at all, since it is a thing of the heart, not of the body; nor is it
without apart from us, but deeply seated within us; nor does any man see
it in another, but each one in himself. Lastly, it is a thing that can
both be feigned by pretence, and be thought to be in him in whom it is
not. Therefore every one sees his own faith in himself; but does not
see, but believes, that it is in another; and believes this the more
firmly, the more he knows the fruits of it, which faith is wont to work
by love. <span id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794) And therefore this
faith is common to all of whom the evangelist subjoins, “But as many as
received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to
them that believe on His name: which were born, not of <span
id="page_169">p. 169</span> <span id="iv.i.xv.ii-Page_169"></span>blood,
nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God;”
common I say, not as any form of a bodily object is common, as regards
sight, to the eyes of all to whom it is present, for in some way the
gaze of all that behold it is informed by the same one form; but as the
human countenance can be said to be common to all men; for this is so
said that yet each certainly has his own. We say certainly with perfect
truth, that the faith of believers is impressed from one doctrine upon
the heart of each several person who believes the same thing. But that
which is believed is a different thing from the faith by which it is
believed. For the former is in things which are said either to be, or to
have been or to be about to be; but the latter is in the mind of the
believer, and is visible to him only whose it is; although not indeed
itself but a faith like it, is also in others. For it is not one in
number, but in kind; yet on account of the likeness, and the absence of
all difference, we rather call it one than many. For when, too, we see
two men exceedingly alike, we wonder, and say that both have one
countenance. It is therefore more easily said that the souls were
many,—a several soul, of course, for each several person—of whom we read
in the Acts of the Apostles, that they were of one soul, <span
id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795) —than it is, where the apostle speaks
of “one faith,” <span id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796) for any one to
venture to say that there are as many faiths as there are faithful. And
yet He who says, “O woman, great is thy faith;” <span
id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797) and to another, “O thou of little
faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?” <span
id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798) intimates that each has his own faith.
But the like faith of believers is said to be one, in the same way as a
like will of those who will is said to be one; since in the case also of
those who have the same will, the will of each is visible to himself,
but that of the other is not visible, although he wills the same thing;
and if it intimate itself by any signs, it is believed rather than seen.
But each being conscious of his own mind certainly does not believe, but
manifestly sees outright, that this is his own will.
