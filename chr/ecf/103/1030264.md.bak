<span id="iv.ii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Good and Evil are an Exception to
the Rule that Contrary Attributes Cannot Be Predicated of the Same
Subject. Evil Springs Up in What is Good, and Cannot Exist Except in
What is Good.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xvi-p2"></span>Accordingly, in the case of these
contraries which we call good and evil, the rule of thelogicians, that
two contraries cannot be predicated at the same time of the same thing,
does not hold. No weather is at the same time dark and bright: no food
or drink is at the same time sweet and bitter: no body is at the same
time and in the same place black and white: none is at the same time and
in the same place deformed and beautiful. And this rule is found to hold
in regard to many, indeed nearly all, contraries, that they cannot exist
at the same time in any one thing. But although no one can doubt that
good and evil are contraries, not only can they exist at the same time,
but evil cannot exist without good, or in anything that is not good.
Good, however, can exist without evil. For a man or an angel can exist
without being wicked; but nothing can be wicked except a man or an
angel: and so far as he is a man or an angel, he is good; so far as he
is wicked, he is an evil. And these two contraries are so far
co-existent, that if good did not exist in what is evil, neither could
evil exist; because corruption could not have either a place to dwell
in, or a source to spring from, if there were nothing that could be
corrupted; and nothing can be corrupted except what is good, for
corruption is nothing else but the destruction of good. From what is
good, then, evils arose, and except in what is good they do not exist;
nor was there any other source from which any evil nature could arise.
For if there were, then, in so far as this was a being, it was certainly
a good: and a being which was incorruptible would be a great good; and
even one which was corruptible must be to some extent a good, for only
by corrupting what was good in it could corruption do it harm.
