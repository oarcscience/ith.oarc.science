<span id="v.ix.ix-p1"></span> 8. We read in the Ecclesiastical History
which Eusebius wrote in Greek, and Ruffinus turned into the Latin
tongue, of Martyr’s bodies in Gaul exposed to dogs, and how the leavings
of those dogs and bones of the dead were, even to uttermost consumption,
by fire burned up; and the ashes of the same scattered on the river
Rhone, lest any thing should be left for any sort whatever of
memorial. <span id="fr_2728"></span>[2729](#fn_2728) Which thing must be
believed to have been to no other end divinely permitted, but that
Christians should learn in confessing Christ, while they despise this
life, much more to despise sepulture. For this thing, which with savage
rage was done to the bodies of Martyrs, if it could any whit hurt them,
to impair the blessed resting of their most victorious spirits, would
assuredly not have been suffered to be done. In very deed therefore it
was declared, that the Lord in saying, “Fear not them which kill the
body, and afterward have no more that they can do,” <span
id="fr_2729"></span>[2730](#fn_2729) did not mean that He would not
permit them to do any thing to the bodies of His followers when dead;
but that whatever they might be permitted to do, nothing should be done
that could lessen the Christian felicity of the departed, nothing
thereof reach to their consciousness while yet living after death;
nothing avail to the detriment, no, not even of the bodies themselves,
to diminish aught of their integrity when they should rise again.
