<span id="v.vii.xxv-p1"></span> 24. This question I should briefly
solve, if I should say, because I should also justly say, that we must
believe the Apostle. For he himself knew why in the Churches of the
Gentiles it was not meet that a venal Gospel were carried about; not
finding fault with his fellow-apostles, but distinguishing his own
ministry; because they, without doubt by admonition of the Holy Ghost,
had so distributed among them the provinces of evangelizing, that Paul
and Barnabas should go <span id="page_516">p. 516</span> <span
id="v.vii.xxv-Page_516"></span>unto the Gentiles, and they unto the
Circumcision. <span id="fr_2555"></span>[2556](#fn_2555) But that he
gave this precept to them who had not the like power, those many things
already said do make manifest. But these brethren of ours rashly
arrogate unto themselves, so far as I can judge, that they have this
kind of power. For if they be evangelists, I confess, they have it: if
ministers of the altar, dispensers of sacraments, of course it is no
arrogating to themselves, but a plain vindicating of a right.
