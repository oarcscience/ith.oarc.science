<span id="v.ix.iv-p1"></span> 3. Possibly thy inquiry is satisfied by
this my brief reply. But what other considerations move me, to which I
think meet to answer, do thou for a short space attend. In the books of
the Maccabees we read of sacrifice offered for the dead. <span
id="fr_2712"></span>[2713](#fn_2712.md) Howbeit even if it were no where at
all read in the Old Scriptures, not small is the authority, which in
this usage is clear, of the whole Church, namely, that in the prayers of
the priest which are offered to the Lord God at His altar, the
Commendation of the dead hath also its place. But then, whether there be
some profit accruing unto the soul of the dead from the place of its
body, requires a more careful inquiry. And first, whether it make any
difference in causing or increasing of misery after this life to the
spirits of men if their bodies be not buried, this must be looked into,
not in the light of opinion however commonly received, but rather of the
holy writ of our religion. For we are not to credit that, as is read in
Maro, the unburied are prohibited from navigating and crossing the
infernal stream: because forsooth

<span id="v.ix.iv-p3"></span>“To none is giv’n to pass the hideous banks

<span id="v.ix.iv-p4"></span>And waters hoarse, ere in their meet abode

<span id="v.ix.iv-p5"></span>The bones have sunk to rest.” <span
id="fr_2713"></span>[2714](#fn_2713.md)

<span id="v.ix.iv-p7"></span>Who can incline a Christian heart to these
poetical and fabulous figments, when the Lord Jesus, to the intent that
under the hands of their enemies, who should have their bodies in their
power, Christians might lie down without a fear, asserts that not a hair
of their head shall perish, exhorting that they should not fear them
which when they have killed the body have nothing more that they can
do? <span id="fr_2714"></span>[2715](#fn_2714.md) Of which in the first
book “On the City of God,” I have methinks enough spoken, to break the
teeth in their mouths who, in imputing to Christian times the barbarous
devastation, especially that which Rome has lately suffered, do cast up
to us this also, that Christ did not there come to the succor of His
own. To whom when it is answered that the souls of the faithful were,
according to the merits of their faith, by Him taken into protection,
they insult over us with talking of their corpses left unburied. All
this matter, then, concerning burial I have in such words as these
expounded.
