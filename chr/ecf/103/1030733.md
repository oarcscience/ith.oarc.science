<span id="v.vii.ii-p1"></span> 1. <span class="c19"><span
id="v.vii.ii-p1.1"></span> Thy</span> bidding, holy brother Aurelius, it
was meet that I should comply withal, with so much the more devotion, by
how much the more it became clear unto me Who, out of thee, did speak
that bidding. For our Lord Jesus Christ, dwelling in thine inner part,
and inspiring into thee a solicitude of fatherly and brotherly charity,
whether our sons and brothers the monks, who neglect to obey blessed
Paul the Apostle, when he saith, “If any will not work, neither let him
eat,” <span id="fr_2475"></span>[2476](#fn_2475.md) are to have that
license permitted unto them; He, assuming unto His work thy will and
tongue, hath commanded me out of thee, that I should hereof write
somewhat unto thee. May He therefore Himself be present with me also,
that I may obey in such sort that from His gift, in the very usefulness
of fruitful labor, I may understand that I am indeed obeying Him.
