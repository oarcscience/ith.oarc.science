<span id="iv.i.iv.xiii"></span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—The Appearance to Lot is
Examined.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p2"></span>“But there came two angels to Sodom at
even.” Here, what I have begun to set forth must be considered more
attentively. Certainly Abraham was speaking with three, and called that
one, in the singular number, the Lord. Perhaps, some one may say, he
recognized one of the three to be the Lord, but the other two His
angels. What, then, does that mean which Scripture goes on to say, “And
the Lord went His way, as soon as He had left communing with Abraham;
and Abraham returned to his place: and there came two angels to Sodom at
even?” Are we to suppose that the one who, among the three, was
recognized as the Lord, had departed, and had sent the two angels that
were with Him to destroy Sodom? Let us see, then, what follows. “There
came,” it is said, “two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate
of Sodom: and Lot seeing them, rose up to meet them; and he bowed
himself with his face toward the ground; and he said, Behold now, my
lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house.” Here it is
clear, both that there were two angels, and that in the plural number
they were invited to partake of hospitality, and that they were
honorably designated lords, when they perchance were thought to be men.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p3"></span>22. Yet, again, it is objected that
except they were known to be angels of God, Lot would not have bowed
himself with his face to the ground. Why, then, is both hospitality and
food offered to them, as though they wanted such human succor? But
whatever may here lie hid, let us now pursue that which we have
undertaken. Two appear; both are called angels; they are invited
plurally; he speaks as with two plurally, until the departure from
Sodom. And then Scripture goes on to say, “And it came to pass, when
they had brought them forth abroad, that they said, Escape for thy life;
look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the
mountain, and there thou shalt be saved, <span
id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) lest thou be consumed. And Lot said
unto them, Oh! not so, my lord: be<span id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.xiii-Page_48"></span>hold now, thy servant hath found grace
in thy sight,” <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md) etc. What is
meant by his saying to them, “Oh! not so, my lord,” if He who was the
Lord had already departed, and had sent the angels? Why is it said, “Oh!
not so, my lord,” and not, “Oh! not so, my lords?” Or if he wished to
speak to one of them, why does Scripture say, “But Lot said to them, Oh!
not so, my lord: behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight,”
etc.? Are we here, too, to understand two persons in the plural number,
but when the two are addressed as one, then the one Lord God of one
substance? But which two persons do we here understand?—of the Father
and of the Son, or of the Father and of the Holy Spirit, or of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit? The last, perhaps, is the more suitable; for
they said of themselves that they were sent, which is that which we say
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. For we find nowhere in the Scriptures
that the Father was sent. <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p6"></span> \[It is difficult to determine the
details of this theophany, beyond all doubt: namely, whether the
“Jehovah” who “went his way as soon as he had left communing with
Abraham.” ([Gen. 18.33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#033.md)<span

Sodom at even” ([Gen. 19.1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p6.3"></span>[Gen xix.
1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p6.4"></span>); or whether one of these “two angels” is
Jehovah himself. One or the other supposition must be made; because a
person is addressed by Lot as God ([Gen.
19.18-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p6.5"></span>[Gen. xix.

24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md)<span

“lords” in [Gen. 19.2](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#002.md)<span

2](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p6.12"></span>, as “profane,” *i.e.*, to be taken in
the human sense, would favor the first supposition. The interchange of
the singular and plural, in the whole narrative is very striking. “It
came to pass, when *they* had brought them forth abroad, that *he* said,
escape for thy life. And Lot said unto *them*. Oh not so, my *Lord:*
behold now, thy servant hath found grace in *thy* sight. And *he* said
unto him, see *I* have accepted thee; *I* will not overthrow the city of
which thou hast spoken.” ([Gen.
