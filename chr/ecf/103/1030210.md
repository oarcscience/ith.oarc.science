<span id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Whether Memory is Also of
Things Present.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p2"></span>14. But some one will say, That is not
memory by which the mind, which is ever present to itself, is affirmed
to remember itself; for memory is of things past, not of things present.
For there are some, and among them Cicero, who, in treating of the
virtues, have divided prudence into these three—memory, understanding,
forethought: to wit, assigning memory to things past, understanding to
things present, forethought to things future; which last is certain only
in the case of those who are prescient of the future; and this is no
gift of men, unless it be granted from above, as to the prophets. And
hence the book of Wisdom, speaking of men, “The thoughts of mortals,” it
says, “are fearful, and our forethought uncertain.” <span
id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879.md) But memory of things past, and
understanding of things present, are certain: certain, I mean,
respecting things incorporeal, which are present; for things corporeal
are present to the sight of the corporeal eyes. But let any one who
denies that there is any memory of things present, attend to the
language used even in profane literature, where exactness of words was
more looked for than truth of things. “Nor did Ulysses suffer such
things, nor did the Ithacan forget himself in so great a peril.” <span
id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880.md) For when Virgil said that Ulysses did
not forget himself, what else did he mean, except that he remembered
himself? And since he was present to himself, he could not possibly
remember himself, unless memory pertained to things present. And,
therefore, as that is called memory in things past which makes it
possible to recall and remember them; so in a thing present, as the mind
is to itself, that is not unreasonably to be called memory, which makes
the mind at hand to itself, so that it can be understood by its own
thought, and then both be joined together by love of itself.
