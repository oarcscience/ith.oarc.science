<span id="iv.iv.i-p1"></span> <span class="c7"><span
id="iv.iv.i-p1.1"></span>Introductory Notice.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iv.iv.i-p2.1"></span>The</span> occasion and date of the composition
of this treatise are indicated in a statement which Augustin makes in
the seventeenth chapter of the First Book of his *Retractations*.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p3"></span>From this we learn that, in its original
form, it was a discourse which Augustin, when only a presbyter, was
requested to deliver in public by the bishops assembled at the Council
of Hippo-Regius, and that it was subsequently issued as a book at the
desire of friends. The general assembly of the North African Church,
which was thus convened at what is now Bona, in the modern territory of
Algiers, took place in the year 393 <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.iv.i-p3.1"></span>A.D.</span>, and was otherwise one of some
historical importance, on account of the determined protest which it
emitted against the position elsewhere allowed to Patriarchs in the
Church, and against the admittance of any more authoritative or
magisterial title to the highest ecclesiastical official than that of
simply “Bishop of the first Church” (*primæ sedis episcopus*).

<span id="iv.iv.i-p4"></span>The work constitutes an exposition of the
several clauses of the so-called Apostles’ Creed. The questions
concerning the mutual relations of the three Persons in the Godhead are
handled with greatest fullness; in connection with which, especially in
the use made of the analogies of Being, Knowledge, and Love, and in the
cautions thrown in against certain applications of these and other
illustrations taken from things of human experience, we come across
sentiments which are also repeated in the *City of God*, the books on
the *Trinity*, and others of his doctrinal writings.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p5"></span>The passage referred to in the
*Retractations* is as follows: About the same period, in presence of the
bishops, who gave me orders to that effect, and who were holding a
plenary Council of the whole of Africa at Hippo-Regius, I delivered, as
presbyter, a discussion on the subject of *Faith and the Creed*. This
disputation, at the very pressing request of some of those who were on
terms of more than usual intimacy and affection with us, I threw into
the form of a book, in which the themes themselves are made the subjects
of discourse, although not in a method involving the adoption of the
particular connection of words which is given to the *competentes* <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md) to be committed to memory. In this
book, when discussing the question of the resurrection of the flesh, I
say: <span id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) ‘Rise again the body
will, according to the Christian faith, which is incapable of deceiving.
And if this appears incredible to any one, \[it is because\] he looks
simply to what the flesh is at present, while he fails to consider of
what nature it shall be hereafter. For at that time of angelic change it
will no more be flesh and blood, but only body;’ and so on, through the
other statements which I have made there on the subject of the change of
bodies terrestrial into bodies celestial, as the apostle, when he spake
from the same point, said, ‘Flesh and blood shall not inherit the
kingdom of God.’ <span id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md) But if any
one takes these declarations in a sense leading him to suppose that the
earthly body, such as we now have it, is changed in the resurrection
into a celestial body, in any such wise as that neither these members
nor the substance of the flesh will subsist any <span id="page_318">p.
318</span> <span id="iv.iv.i-Page_318"></span>more, undoubtedly he must
be set right, by being put in mind of the body of the Lord, who
subsequently to His resurrection appeared in the same members, as One
who was not only to be seen with the eyes, but also handled with the
hands; and made His possession of the flesh likewise surer by the
discourse which He spake, saying, ‘Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath
not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.’ <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md) Hence it is certain that the
apostle did not deny that the substance of the flesh will exist in the
kingdom of God, but that under the name of ‘flesh and blood’ he
designated either men who live after the flesh, or the express
corruption of the flesh, which assuredly at that period shall subsist no
more. For after he had said, ‘Flesh and blood shall not inherit the
kingdom of God,’ what he proceeds to say next,—namely, ‘neither shall
corruption inherit incorruption,’—is rightly taken to have been added by
way of explaining his previous statement. And on this subject, which is
one on which it is difficult to convince unbelievers, any one who reads
my last book, *On the City of God*, will find that I have discoursed
with the utmost carefulness of which I am capable. <span
id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md) The performance in question
commences thus: ‘Since it is written,’ etc.”
