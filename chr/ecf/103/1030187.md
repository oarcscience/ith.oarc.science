<span id="iv.i.xv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—We Say that Future Blessedness is
Truly Eternal, Not Through Human Reasonings, But by the Help of Faith.
The Immortality of Blessedness Becomes Credible from the Incarnation of
the Son of God.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xv.ix-p2"></span>12. Whether human nature can receive
this, which yet it confesses to be desirable, is no small question. But
if faith be present, which is in those to whom Jesus has given power to
become the sons of God, then there is no question. Assuredly, of those
who endeavor to discover it from human reasonings, scarcely a few, and
they endued with great abilities, and abounding in leisure, and learned
with the most subtle learning, have been able to attain to the
investigation of the immortality of the soul alone. And even for the
soul they have not found a blessed life that is stable, that is, true;
since they have said that it returns to the miseries of this life even
after blessedness. And they among them who are ashamed of this opinion,
and have thought that the purified soul is to be placed in eternal
happiness without a body, hold such opinions concerning the past
eternity of the world, as to confute this opinion of theirs concerning
the soul; a thing which here it is too long to demonstrate; but it has
been, as I think, sufficiently explained by us in the twelfth book of
the *City of God*. <span id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803) But that
faith promises, not by human reasoning, but by divine authority, that
the whole man, who certainly consists of soul <span id="page_174">p.
174</span> <span id="iv.i.xv.ix-Page_174"></span>and body, shall be
immortal, and on this account truly blessed. And so, when it had been
said in the Gospel, that Jesus has given “power to become the sons of
God to them who received Him;” and what it is to have received Him had
been shortly explained by saying, “To them that believe on His name;”
and it was further added in what way they are to become sons of God,
*viz*., “Which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor
of the will of man, but of God;”—lest that infirmity of men which we all
see and bear should despair of attaining so great excellence, it is
added in the same place, “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among
us;” <span id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804) that, on the contrary, men
might be convinced of that which seemed incredible. For if He who is by
nature the Son of God was made the Son of man through mercy for the sake
of the sons of men,—for this is what is meant by “The Word was made
flesh, and dwelt among us” men,—how much more credible is it that the
sons of men by nature should be made the sons of God by the grace of
God, and should dwell in God, in whom alone and from whom alone the
blessed can be made partakers of that immortality; of which that we
might be convinced, the Son of God was made partaker of our mortality?
