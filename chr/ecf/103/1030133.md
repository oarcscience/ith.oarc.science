<span id="iv.i.xi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—In the Love of Spiritual Things
the Word Born is the Same as the Word Conceived. It is Otherwise in the
Love of Carnal Things.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xi.ix-p2"></span>14. But the word conceived and the word
born are the very same when the will finds rest in knowledge itself, as
is the case in the love of spiritual things. For instance, he who knows
righteousness perfectly, and loves it perfectly, is already righteous;
even if no necessity exist of working according to it outwardly through
the members of the body. But in the love of carnal and temporal things,
as in the offspring of animals, the conception of the word is one thing,
the bringing forth another. For here what is conceived by desiring is
born by attaining. Since it does not suffice to avarice to know and to
love gold, except it also have it; nor to know and love to eat, or to
lie with any one, unless also one does it; nor to know and love honors
and power, unless they actually come to pass. Nay, all these things,
even if obtained, do not suffice. “Whosoever drinketh of this water,” He
says, “shall thirst again.” <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707) And
so also the Psalmist, “He hath conceived pain and brought forth
iniquity.” <span id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708) And he speaks of pain
or labor as conceived, when those things are conceived which it is not
sufficient to know and will, and when the mind burns and grows sick with
want, until it arrives at those things, and, as it were, brings them
forth. Whence in the Latin language we have the word “parta” used
elegantly for both “reperta” and “comperta,” which words sound as if
derived from bringing forth. <span id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709)
Since “lust, when it hath conceived, bringeth forth sin.” <span
id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710) Wherefore the Lord proclaims, “Come
unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden;” <span
id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711) and in another place “Woe unto them
that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days!” <span
id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712) And when therefore He referred all
either right actions or sins to the bringing forth of the word, “By thy
mouth,” <span id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713) He says, “thou shalt be
justified, and by thy mouth <span id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714) thou
shalt be condemned,” <span id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715) intending
thereby not the visible mouth, but that which is within and invisible,
of the thought and of the heart.
