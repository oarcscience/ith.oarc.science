<span id="v.iii.xxvi-p1"></span> 25. Nor indeed hath the Holy Spirit
failed to speak what should be of open and unshaken avail against these
men, most shamelessly and madly obstinate, and should repel their
assault, as of wild beasts, from His sheep-fold, by defences that may
not be stormed. For, after He had said concerning eunuchs, “I will give
unto them in My house and in My wall a named place, much better than of
sons and daughters;” <span id="fr_2068"></span>[2069](#fn_2068) lest any
too carnal should think that there was any thing temporal to be hoped
for in these words, straightway He added, “An eternal name I will give
unto them, nor shall it ever fail:” as though He should say, Why dost
thou draw back, impious blindness? Why dost thou draw back? Why dost
thou pour the clouds of thy perverseness over the clear (sky) of truth?
Why in so great light of Scriptures dost thou seek after darkness from
out which to lay snares? Why dost thou promise temporal advantage only
to holy persons exercising continence? “An eternal name I will give unto
them:” why, where persons keep from all sexual intercourse, and also in
the very fact that they abstain from these, have thought of the things
of the Lord, how to please the Lord, do you essay to refer them unto
earthly advantage? “An eternal name I will give unto them.” Why contend
you that the kingdom of heaven, for the sake of which holy eunuchs have
made themselves eunuchs, is to be understood in this life only? “An
eternal name I will give unto them.” And if haply in this place you
endeavor to take the word itself eternal in the sense of lasting for a
long time, I add, I heap up, I tread in, “nor shall it ever fail.” What
more seek you? What more say you? This eternal name, whatever it be,
unto the eunuchs of God, which assuredly signifies a certain peculiar
and excellent glory, shall not be in common with many, although set in
the same <span id="page_426">p. 426</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxvi-Page_426"></span>kingdom, and in the same house. For on
this account also, perhaps, it is called a name, that it distinguishes
those, to whom it is given, from the rest.
