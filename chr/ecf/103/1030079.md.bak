<span id="iv.i.vii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.vii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—God the Only Unchangeable
Essence.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vii.ii-p2"></span>3. He is, however, without doubt, a
substance, or, if it be better so to call it, an essence, which the
Greeks call <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.vii.ii-p2.1"></span>οὐσία</span>. For as wisdom is so called
from the being wise, and knowledge from knowing; so from being <span
id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565.md) comes that which we call essence. And
who is there that is, more than He who said to His servant Moses, “I am
that I am;” and, “Thus shall thou say unto the children of Israel, He
who is hath sent me unto you?” <span id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566.md)
But other things that are called essences or substances admit of
accidents, whereby a change, whether great or small, is produced in
them. But there can be no accident of this kind in respect to God; and
therefore He who is God is the only unchangeable substance or essence,
to whom certainly <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.vii.ii-p4.3"></span>being</span> itself, whence comes the name
of essence, most especially and most truly belongs. For that which is
changed does not retain its own being; and that which can be changed,
although it be not actually changed, is able not to be that which it had
been; and hence that which not only is not changed, but also cannot at
all be changed, alone falls most truly, without difficulty or
hesitation, under the category of <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.vii.ii-p4.4"></span>being</span>.
