<span id="v.vi.xxix-p1"></span> 28. Hence is also that which thou hast
mentioned that they speak of, that the Lord Jesus, after He was risen,
walked in the way with two disciples; and upon their drawing near to the
village whither they were going, He made as though He would have gone
farther: where the Evangelist, saying, “But He Himself feigned that He
would go further,” <span id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434) hath put
that very word in which liars too greatly delight, that they may with
impunity lie: as if every thing that is feigned is a lie, whereas in a
truthful way, for the sake of signifying one thing by another, so many
things use to be feigned. If then there had been no other thing that
Jesus signified, in that He feigned to be going further, with reason
might it be judged to be a lie: but then if it be rightly understood and
referred to that which He willed to signify, it is a mystery. Else will
all things be lies which, on account of a certain similitude of things
to be signified, although they never were done, are related to have been
done. Of which sort is that concerning the two sons of one man, the
elder who tarried with his father, and the younger who went into a far
country, which is narrated so much at length. <span
id="fr_2435"></span>[2436](#fn_2435) In which sort of fiction, men have
put even human deeds or words to irrational animals and things without
sense, that by this sort of feigned narrations but true significations,
they might in more winning manner intimate the things which they wished.
Nor is it only in authors of secular letters, as in Horace, <span
id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436) that mouse speaks to mouse, and
weasel to fox, that through a fictitious narration a true signification
may be referred to the matter in hand; whence the like fables of Æsop
being referred to the same end, there is no man so untaught as to think
they ought to be called lies: but in Holy Writ also, as in the book of
Judges, the trees seek them a king, and speak to the olive, to the fig
and to the vine and to the bramble. <span
id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437) Which, in any wise, is all feigned,
with intent that one may get to the thing which is intended, by a
feigned narration indeed, yet not a lying one, but with a truthful
signification. This I have said on account of that which is written
concerning Jesus, “And Himself feigned to be going further:” lest any
from this word, like the Priscillianists, wishing to have license of
lying, should contend that beside others even Christ did lie. But whoso
would understand what He by feigning that did prefigure, let him attend
to that which He by acting did effect. For when afterwards He did go
further, above all heavens, yet deserted He not His disciples. In order
to signify this which in the future He did as God, at the present He
feigned to do that as Man. And therefore was a veritable signification
caused in that feigning to go before, because in this departure the
verity of that signification did follow after. Let him therefore contend
that Christ did lie by feigning, who denieth that He fulfilled by doing
that which He signified.
