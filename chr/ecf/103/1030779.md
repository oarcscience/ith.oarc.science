<span id="v.viii.v-p1"></span> 4. Nay more; for is it not so that even
for open wickednesses, not to punish but to perpetrate them, men put up
with many most grievous troubles? Do not authors of secular letters tell
of a certain right noble parricide of his country, that hunger, thirst,
cold, all these he was able to endure, and his body was patient of lack
of food and warmth and sleep to a degree surpassing belief? <span
id="fr_2632"></span>[2633](#fn_2632) Why speak of highway robbers, all
of whom while they lie in wait for travellers endure whole nights
without sleep, and that they may catch, as they pass by, men who have no
thought of harm, will, no matter how foul the weather, plant in one spot
their mind and body, which are full of thoughts of harm? Nay it is said
that some of them are wont to torture one another by turns, to that
degree that this practice and training against pains is not a whit short
of pains. For, not so much perchance are they excruciated by the Judge,
that through smart of pain the truth may be got at, as they are by their
own comrades, that through patience of pain truth may not be betrayed.
And yet in all these the patience is rather to be wondered at than
praised: nay neither wondered at nor praised, seeing it is no patience;
but we must wonder at the hardness, deny the patience: for there is
nothing in this rightly to be praised, nothing usefully to be imitated;
and thou wilt rightly judge the mind to be all the more worthy of
greater punishment, the more it yields up to vices the instruments of
virtues. Patience is companion of wisdom, not handmaid of concupiscence:
patience is the friend of a good conscience, not the foe of innocence.
