<span id="iv.ii.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—Men, Being by Nature the
Children of Wrath, Needed a Mediator. In What Sense God is Said to Be
Angry.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxxv-p2"></span>And so the human race was lying under a
just condemnation, and all men were the children of wrath. Of which
wrath it is written: “All our days are passed away in Thy wrath; we
spend our years as a tale that is told.” <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139) Of which wrath also Job says: “Man
that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.” <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140) Of which wrath also the Lord Jesus
says: “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that
believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth
on him.” <span id="fr_1141"></span>[1142](#fn_1141) He does not say it
will come, but it “abideth on him.” For every man is born with it;
wherefore the apostle says: “We were by nature the children of wrath,
even as others.” <span id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142) Now, as men
were lying under this wrath by reason of their original sin, and as this
original sin was the <span id="page_249">p. 249</span> <span
id="iv.ii.xxxv-Page_249"></span>more heavy and deadly in proportion to
the number and magnitude of the actual sins which were added to it,
there was need for a Mediator, that is, for a reconciler, who, by the
offering of one sacrifice, of which all the sacrifices of the law and
the prophets were types, should take away this wrath. Wherefore the
apostle says: “For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
by the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved
by His life.” <span id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143) Now when God is
said to be angry, we do not attribute to Him such a disturbed feeling as
exists in the mind of an angry man; but we call His just displeasure
against sin by the name “anger,” a word transferred by analogy from
human emotions. But our being reconciled to God through a Mediator, and
receiving the Holy Spirit, so that we who were enemies are made sons
(“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
God” <span id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144) ): this is the grace of
God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
