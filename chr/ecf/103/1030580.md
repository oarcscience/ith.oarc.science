<span id="v.iii.xxvii-p1"></span> 26. What then, say they, is the
meaning of that penny, which is given in payment to all alike when the
work of the vineyard is ended? whether it be to those who have labored
from the first hour, or to those who have labored one hour? <span
id="fr_2069"></span>[2070](#fn_2069) What assuredly doth it signify, but
something, which all shall have in common, such as is life eternal
itself, the kingdom of heaven itself, where shall be all, whom God hath
predestinated, called, justified, glorified? “For it behoveth that this
corruptible put on incorruption, and this mortal put on
immortality.” <span id="fr_2070"></span>[2071](#fn_2070) This is that
penny, wages for all. Yet “star differeth from star in glory; so also
the resurrection of the dead.” <span
id="fr_2071"></span>[2072](#fn_2071) These are the different merits of
the Saints. For, if by that penny the heaven were signified, have not
all the stars in common to be in the heaven? And yet, “There is one
glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, another of the stars.” If
that penny were taken for health of body, have not all the members, when
we are well, health in common; and, should this health continue even
unto death, is it not in all alike and equally? And yet, “God hath set
the members, each one of them, in the body, as He would;” <span
id="fr_2072"></span>[2073](#fn_2072) that neither the whole be an eye,
nor the whole hearing, nor the whole smelling: and, whatever else there
is, it hath its own property, although it have health equally with all.
Thus because life eternal itself shall be alike to all, an equal penny
was assigned to all; but, because in that life eternal itself the lights
of merits shall shine with a distinction, there are “many mansions” in
the house of the Father: <span id="fr_2073"></span>[2074](#fn_2073) and,
by this means, in the penny not unlike, one lives not longer than
another; but in the many mansions, one is honored with greater
brightness than another.
