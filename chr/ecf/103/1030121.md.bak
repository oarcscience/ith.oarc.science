<span id="iv.i.x.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.x.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—That He Who Loves His Brother,
Loves God; Because He Loves Love Itself, Which is of God, and is
God.</span>

<span id="iv.i.x.ix-p2"></span>12. Let no one say, I do not know what I
love. Let him love his brother, and he will love the same love. For he
knows the love with which he loves, more than the brother whom he loves.
So now he can know God more than he knows his brother: clearly known
more, because more present; known more, because more within him; known
more, because more certain. Embrace the love of God, and by love embrace
God. That is love itself, which associates together all good angels and
all the servants of God by the bond of sanctity, and joins together us
and them mutually with ourselves, and joins us subordinately to Himself.
In proportion, therefore, as we are healed from the swelling of pride,
in such proportion are we more filled with love; and with what is he
full, who is full of love, except with God? Well, but you will say, I
see love, and, as far as I am able, I gaze upon it with my mind, and I
believe the Scripture, saying, that “God is love; and he that dwelleth
in love, dwelleth in God;” <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) but
when I see love, I do not see in it the Trinity. Nay, but thou dost see
the Trinity if thou seest love. But if I can I will put you in mind,
that thou mayest see that thou seest it; only let itself be present,
that we may be moved by love to something good. Since, when we love
love, we love one who loves something, and that on account of this very
thing, that he does love something; therefore what does love love, that
love itself also may be loved? For that is not love which loves nothing.
But if it loves itself it must love something, that it may love itself
as love. For as a word indicates something, and indicates also itself,
but does not indicate itself to be a word, unless it indicates that it
does indicate something; so love also loves indeed itself, but except it
love itself as loving something, it loves itself not as love. What
therefore does love love, except that which we love with love? But this,
to begin from that which is nearest to us, is our brother. And listen
how greatly the Apostle John commends brotherly love: “He that loveth
his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of
stumbling in him.” <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) It is
manifest that he placed the perfection of righteousness in the love of
our brother; for he certainly is perfect in whom “there is no occasion
of stumbling.” And yet he seems to have passed by the love of God in
silence; which he never would have done, unless because he intends God
to be understood in brotherly love itself. For in this same epistle, a
little further on, he says most plainly thus: “Beloved, let us love one
another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God,
and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.”
And this passage declares sufficiently and plainly, that this same
brotherly love itself (for that is brotherly love by which we love each
other) is set forth by so great authority, not only to be from God, but
also to be God. When, therefore, we love our brother from love, we love
our brother from God; neither can it be that we do not love above all
else that same love by which we love our brother: whence it may be
gathered that these two commandments cannot exist unless
interchangeably. For since “God is love,” he who loves love certainly
loves God; but he must needs love love, who loves his brother. And so a
little after he says, “For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath
seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen”? <span
id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) because the reason that he does not
see God is, that he does not love his brother. For he who does not love
his brother, abideth not in love; and he who abideth not in love,
abideth not in God, because God is love. Further, he who abideth not in
God, abideth not in light; for “God is light, and in Him is no darkness
at all.” <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) He therefore who
abideth not in light, what wonder is it if he does not see light, that
is, does not see God, because he is in darkness? But he sees his brother
with human sight, with which God cannot be seen. But if he loved with
spiritual love him whom he sees with human sight, he would see God, who
is love itself, with the inner sight by which He can be seen. Therefore
he who does not love his brother whom <span id="page_124">p. 124</span>
<span id="iv.i.x.ix-Page_124"></span>he sees, how can he love God, whom
on that account he does not see, because God is love, which he has not
who does not love his brother? Neither let that further question disturb
us, how much of love we ought to spend upon our brother, and how much
upon God: incomparably more upon God than upon ourselves, but upon our
brother as much as upon ourselves; and we love ourselves so much the
more, the more we love God. Therefore we love God and our neighbor from
one and the same love; but we love God for the sake of God, and
ourselves and our neighbors for the sake of God.
