<span id="v.v.xi-p1"></span> 10. As concerning purity of body; here
indeed a very honorable regard seems to come in the way, and to demand a
lie in its behalf; to wit, that if the assault of the ravisher may be
escaped by means of a lie, it is indubitably right to tell it: but to
this it may easily be answered, that there is no purity of body except
as it depends on integrity of mind; this being broken, the other must
needs fall, even though it seem intact; and for this reason it is not to
be reckoned among temporal things, as a thing that might be taken away
from people against their will. By no means therefore must the mind
corrupt itself by a lie for the sake of its body, which it knows
remaineth incorrupt if from the mind itself incorruptness depart not.
For that which by violence, with no lust foregoing, the body suffereth,
is rather to be called deforcement than corruption. Or if all
deforcement is corruption, then not every corruption hath turpitude, but
only that which lust hath procured, or to which lust hath consented. Now
by how much the mind is more excellent than the body, so much the more
heinous is the wickedness if that be corrupted. There, then, purity can
be preserved, because there none but a voluntary corruption can have
place. For assuredly if the ravisher assault the body, and there is no
escaping him either by contrary force, or by any contrivance or lie, we
must needs allow that purity cannot be violated by another’s lust.
Wherefore, since no man doubts that the mind is better than the body, to
integrity of body we ought to prefer integrity of mind, which can be
preserved for ever. Now who will say that the mind of him who tells a
lie hath its integrity? Indeed lust itself is rightly defined, An
appetite of the mind by which to eternal goods any temporal goods
whatever are preferred. Therefore no man can prove that it is at any
time right to tell a lie, unless he be able to show that any eternal
good can be obtained by a lie. But since each man departs from eternity
just in so far as he departs from truth, it is most absurd to say, that
by departing therefrom it is possible for any man to attain to any good.
Else if there be any eternal good which truth compriseth not, it will
not be a true good, therefore neither will it be good, because it will
be false. But as the mind to the body, so must also truth be preferred
to the mind itself, so that the mind should desire it not only more than
the body, but even more than its own self. So will the mind be more
entire and chaste, when it shall enjoy the immutability of truth rather
than its own mutability. Now if Lot, <span
id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326.md) being so righteous a man that he
was meet <span id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327.md) to entertain even
Angels, offered his daughters to the lust of the Sodomites, to the
intent, that the bodies of women rather than of men might be corrupted
by them; how much more diligently and constantly ought the mind’s
chasteness in the truth to be preserved, seeing it is more truly
preferable to its body, than the body of a man to the body of a woman?
