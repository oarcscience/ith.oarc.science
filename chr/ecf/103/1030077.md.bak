<span id="iv.i.vii-p3"></span>Proceeds to treat of the arguments put
forward by the heretics, not from Scripture, but from their own reason.
Those are refuted, who think the substance of the Father and of the Son
to be not the same, because everything predicated of God is, in their
opinion, predicated of Him according to substance; and therefore it
follows, that to beget and to be begotten, or to be begotten and
unbegotten, being diverse, are diverse substances; whereas it is here
demonstrated that not everything predicated of God is predicated
according to substance, in such manner as He is called good and great
according to substance, or anything else that is predicated of Him in
respect to Himself; but that some things are also predicated of Him
relatively, i.e. not in respect to Himself, but to something not
Himself, as He is called Father in respect to the Son, and Lord in
respect to the creature that serveth Him; in which case, if anything
thus predicated relatively, i.e. in respect to something not Himself, is
even predicated as happening in time, as e.g. “Lord, thou hast become
our refuge,” yet nothing happens to God so as to work a change in Him,
but He Himself remains absolutely unchangeable in His own nature or
essence.
