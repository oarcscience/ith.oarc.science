<span id="v.vii.xii-p1"></span> 11. And he goes on, and adjoins, lest
perchance any should imagine that he only therefore received not,
because they had not given: “But I have not written these things that
they may be so done unto me: good is it for me rather to die than that
any make void my glory.” <span id="fr_2500"></span>[2501](#fn_2500.md) What
glory, unless that which he wished to have with God, while in Christ
suffering with the weak? As he is presently about to say most openly;
“For if I shall have preached the Gospel, there is not to me any glory:
for necessity is laid upon me;” <span
id="fr_2501"></span>[2502](#fn_2501.md) that is, of sustaining this life.
“For woe will be to me,” he saith, “if I preach not the Gospel:” that
is, to my own will shall I forbear to preach the Gospel, because I shall
be tormented with hunger, and shall not have whereof to live. For he
goes on, and says; “For if willingly I do this, I have a reward.” By his
doing it <span id="page_509">p. 509</span> <span
id="v.vii.xii-Page_509"></span>willingly, he means, if he do it
uncompelled by any necessity of supporting this present life; and for
this he hath reward, to wit, with God, of glory everlasting. “But if
unwilling,” saith he, “a dispensation is entrusted unto me:” <span
id="fr_2502"></span>[2503](#fn_2502.md) that is, if being unwilling, I am
by necessity of passing through this present life, compelled to preach
the Gospel, “a dispensation is entrusted unto me;” to wit, that by my
dispensation as a steward, because Christ, because the truth, is that
which I preach, howsoever because of occasion, howsoever seeking mine
own, howsoever by necessity of earthly emolument compelled so to do,
other men do profit, but I have not that glorious and everlasting reward
with God. “What then,” saith he, “shall be my reward?” He saith it as
asking a question: therefore the pronunciation must be suspended, until
he give the answer. Which the more easily to understand, let, as it
were, us put the question to him, “What, then, will be thy reward, O
Apostle, when that earthly reward due to good evangelists, not for its
sake evangelizing, but yet taking it as the consequence and offered to
them by the Lord’s appointment, thou acceptest not? What shall be thy
reward then?” See what he replies: “That, preaching the Gospel, I may
make the Gospel of Christ without charge;” that is, that the Gospel may
not be to believers expensive, lest they account that for this end is
the Gospel to be preached to them, that its preachers should seem as it
were to sell it. And yet he comes back again and again, that he may show
what, by warrant of the Lord, he hath a right unto, yet doeth not: “that
I abuse not,” saith he, “my power in the Gospel.” <span
