id="iv.i.xii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Why the Soul is Enjoined to Know
Itself. Whence Come the Errors of the Mind Concerning Its Own
Substance.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xii.v-p2"></span>7. Why therefore is it enjoined upon it,
that it should know itself? I suppose, in order that, it may consider
itself, and live according to its own nature; that is, seek to be
regulated according to its own nature, *viz*., under Him to whom it
ought to be subject, and above those things to which it is to be
preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be ruled, above those things
which it ought to rule. For it does many things through vicious desire,
as though in forgetfulness of itself. For it sees some things
intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and
whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is
turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself,
and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own,
and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which
it thinks to be more and more; for it is neither sufficient for itself,
nor is anything at all sufficient for it, if it withdraw from Him who is
alone sufficient: and so through want and distress it becomes too intent
upon its own actions and upon the unquiet delights which it obtains
through them: and thus, by the desire of acquiring knowledge from those
things that are without, the nature of which it knows and loves, and
which it feels can be lost unless held fast with anxious care, it loses
its security, and thinks of itself so much the less, in proportion as it
feels the more secure that it cannot lose itself. So, whereas it is one
thing not to know oneself, and another not to think of oneself (for we
do not say of the man that is skilled in much learning, that he is
ignorant of grammar, when he is only not thinking of it, because he is
thinking at the time of the art of medicine);—whereas, then, I say it is
one thing not to know oneself, and another not to think of oneself, such
is the strength of love, that the mind draws in with itself those things
which it has long thought of with love, and has grown into them by the
close adherence of diligent study, even when it returns in some way to
think of itself. And because these things are corporeal which it loved
externally through the carnal senses; and because it has become
entangled with them by a kind of daily familiarity, and yet cannot carry
those corporeal things themselves with itself internally as it were into
the region of incorporeal nature; therefore it combines certain images
of them, and thrusts them thus made from itself into itself. For it
gives to the forming of them somewhat of its own substance, yet
preserves the while something by which it may judge freely of the
species of those images; and this something is more properly the mind,
that is, the rational understanding, which is preserved that it may
judge. For we see that we have those parts of the soul which are
informed by the likenesses of corporeal things, in common also with
beasts.
