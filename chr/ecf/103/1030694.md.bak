<span id="v.vi.vi-p1"></span> 5. Well then, let us set before our eyes a
cunning spy as he makes up to the person whom he has already perceived
to be a Priscillianist; he begins with Dictinius the bishop, and lyingly
bepraises either his life, if he knew him, or his fame, if he knew him
not; this is more tolerable thus far, because Dictinius is accounted to
have been a Catholic, and to have been corrected of that error. Then,
passing on to Priscillian, (for this comes next in the art of lying,) he
shall make reverend mention of him, of an impious and detestable person,
condemned for his nefarious wickedness and crimes! In which reverend
mention, if haply the person for whom this sort of net is spread, had
not been a firm Priscillianist, by this preaching of him, he will be
confirmed. But when the spy shall go on to discourse of the other
matters, and saying that he pities them whom the author of darkness hath
invoked in such darkness of error, that they acknowledge not the honor
of their own soul, and the brightness of their divine ancestry: then
speaking of Dictinius’s Book, which is called “the Pound,” because it
<span id="page_484">p. 484</span> <span
id="v.vi.vi-Page_484"></span>treats, first and last, of a dozen
questions, being as the ounces which go to the pound, shall extol it
with such praise, as to protest that such a “Pound” (in which awful
blasphemies are contained) is more precious than many thousands of
pounds of gold; truly, this astuteness of him who tells the lie slays
the soul of him who believes it, or, that being slain already, doth in
the same death sink, and hold it down. But, thou wilt say, “afterwards
it shall be set at liberty.” What if it come not to pass, either upon
something intervening that prevents what was begun from being completed,
or through obstinacy of an heretical mind denying the same things over
again, although of some it had already begun to make confession?
especially because, if he shall find out that he has been tampered with
by a stranger, he will just the more boldy study to conceal his
sentiments by a lie, when he shall have learned much more certainly that
this is done without blame, even by the example of the very person who
tampered with him. This, truly, in a man who thinks it right to hide the
truth by telling a lie, with what face can we blame, and dare to condemn
what we teach?
