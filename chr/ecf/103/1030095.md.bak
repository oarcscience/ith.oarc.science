<span id="iv.i.viii.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.viii.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—The Son, According to the
Apostle, is the Power and Wisdom of the Father. Hence the Reasoning of
the Catholics Against the Earlier Arians. A Difficulty is Raised,
Whether the Father is Not Wisdom Himself, But Only the Father of
Wisdom.</span>

<span id="iv.i.viii.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.viii.i-p2.1"></span> Some</span>think themselves hindered from
admitting the equality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, because it
is written, “Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God;” in that,
on this ground, there does not appear to be equality; because the Father
is not Himself power and wisdom, but the begetter of power and wisdom.
And, in truth, the question is usually asked with no common earnestness,
in what way God can be called the Father of power and wisdom. For the
apostle says, “Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.” <span
id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601.md) And hence some on our side have
reasoned in this way against the Arians, at least against those who at
first set themselves up against the Catholic faith. For Arius himself is
reported to have said, that if He is a Son, then He was born; if He was
born, there was a time when the Son was not: not understanding that even
to be born is, to God, from all eternity; so that the Son is co-eternal
with the Father, as the brightness which is produced and is spread
around by fire is co-eval with it, and would be co-eternal, if fire were
eternal. And therefore some of the later Arians have abandoned that
opinion, and have confessed that the Son of God did not begin to be in
time. But among the arguments which those on our side used to hold
against them who said that there was a time when the Son was not, some
were wont to introduce such an argument as this: If the Son of God is
the power and wisdom of God, and God was never without power and wisdom,
then the Son is co-eternal with God the Father; but the apostle says,
“Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God;” and a man must be
senseless to say that God at any time had not power or wisdom; therefore
there was no time when the Son was not.

<span id="iv.i.viii.i-p4"></span>2. Now this argument compels us to say
that God the Father is not wise, except by having the wisdom which He
begat, not by the Father in Himself being wisdom itself. Further, if it
be so, just as the Son also Himself is called God of God, Light of
Light, we must consider whether He can be called wisdom of wisdom, if
God the Father is not wisdom itself, but only the begetter of wisdom.
And if we hold this, why is He not the begetter also of His own
greatness, and of His own goodness, and of His own eternity, and of His
own omnipotence; so that He is not Himself His own greatness, and His
own goodness, and His own eternity, and His own omnipotence; but is
great with that greatness which He begat, and good with that goodness,
and eternal with that eternity, and omnipotent with that omnipotence,
which was born of Him; just as He Himself is not His own wisdom, but is
wise with that wisdom which was born of Him? For we need not be afraid
of being compelled to say <span id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span
id="iv.i.viii.i-Page_98"></span>that there are many sons of God, over
and above the adoption of the creature, co-eternal with the Father, if
He be the begetter of His own greatness, and goodness, and eternity, and
omnipotence. Because it is easy to reply to this cavil, that it does not
at all follow, because many things are named, that He should be the
Father of many co-eternal *sons*; just as it does not follow that He is
the Father of two sons, because Christ is said to be the power of God,
and the wisdom of God. For that certainly is the power which is the
wisdom, and that is the wisdom which is the power; and in like manner,
therefore, of the rest also; so that that is the greatness which is the
power, or any other of those things which either have been mentioned
above, or may hereafter be mentioned.
