<span id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Our Word is Never to Be
Equalled to the Divine Word, Not Even When We Shall Be Like God.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p2"></span>Wherefore that Word of God is in such
wise so called, as not to be called a thought of God, lest we believe
that there is anything in God which can be revolved, so that it at one
time receives and at another recovers a form, so as to be a word, and
again can lose that form and be revolved in some sense formlessly.
Certainly that excellent master of speech knew well the force of words,
and had looked into the nature of thought, who said in his poem, “And
revolves with himself the varying issues of war,” <span
id="fr_993"></span>[994](#fn_993) *i.e.* thinks of them. That Son of
God, then, is not called the Thought of God, but the Word of God. For
our own thought, attaining to what we know, and formed thereby, is our
true word. And so the Word of God ought to be understood without any
thought on the part of God, so that it be understood as the simple <span
id="page_215">p. 215</span> <span
id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-Page_215"></span>form itself, but containing nothing
formable that can be also unformed. There are, indeed, passages of Holy
Scripture that speak of God’s thoughts; but this is after the same mode
of speech by which the forgetfulness of God is also there spoken of,
whereas in strict propriety of language there is in Him certainly no
forgetfulness.

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p4"></span>26. Wherefore, since we have found
now in this enigma so great an unlikeness to God and the Word of God,
wherein yet there was found before some likeness, this, too, must be
admitted, that even when we shall be like Him, when “we shall see Him as
He is” <span id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994) (and certainly he who
said this was aware beyond doubt of our present unlikeness), not even
then shall we be equal to Him in nature. For that nature which is made
is ever less than that which makes. And at that time our word will not
indeed be false, because we shall neither lie nor be deceived. Perhaps,
too, our thoughts will no longer revolve by passing and repassing from
one thing to another, but we shall see all our knowledge at once, and at
one glance. Still, when even this shall have come to pass, if indeed it
shall come to pass, the creature which was formable will indeed have
been formed, so that nothing will be wanting of that form to which it
ought to attain; yet nevertheless it will not be to be equalled to that
simplicity wherein there is not anything formable, which has been formed
or reformed, but only form; and which being neither formless nor formed,
itself is eternal and unchangeable substance.
