<span id="v.iii.xxix-p1"></span> 28. Therefore let the rest of the
faithful, who have lost virginity, follow the Lamb, not whithersoever He
shall have gone, but so far as ever they shall have been able. But they
are able every where, save when He walks in the grace of virginity.
“Blessed are the poor in spirit;” <span
id="fr_2080"></span>[2081](#fn_2080.md) imitate Him, Who, whereas “He was
rich, was made poor for your sakes.” <span
id="fr_2081"></span>[2082](#fn_2081.md) “Blessed are the meek;” imitate
Him, Who said, “Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly <span
id="page_427">p. 427</span> <span id="v.iii.xxix-Page_427"></span>of
heart.” <span id="fr_2082"></span>[2083](#fn_2082.md) “Blessed are they
that mourn;” imitate Him, Who “wept over” Jerusalem. <span
id="fr_2083"></span>[2084](#fn_2083.md) “Blessed are they, who hunger and
thirst after righteousness;” imitate Him, Who said, “My meat is to do
the will of Him Who sent Me.” <span id="fr_2084"></span>[2085](#fn_2084.md)
“Blessed are the merciful;” imitate Him, Who came to the help of him who
was wounded by robbers, and who lay in the way half-dead and despaired
of. <span id="fr_2085"></span>[2086](#fn_2085.md) “Blessed are the pure in
heart;” imitate Him, “Who did no sin, neither was guile found in His
mouth.” <span id="fr_2086"></span>[2087](#fn_2086.md) “Blessed are the
peace-makers;” imitate Him, Who said on behalf of His persecutors,
“Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” <span
id="fr_2087"></span>[2088](#fn_2087.md) “Blessed are they, who suffer
persecution for righteousness sake;” imitate Him, Who “suffered for you,
leaving you an example, that ye follow His steps.” <span
id="fr_2088"></span>[2089](#fn_2088.md) These things, whoso imitate, in
these they follow the Lamb. But surely even married persons may go in
those steps, although not setting their foot perfectly in the same
print, <span id="fr_2089"></span>[2090](#fn_2089.md) yet walking in the
same paths.
