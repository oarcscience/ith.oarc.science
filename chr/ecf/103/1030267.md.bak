id="iv.ii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—The Nature of Error. All Error is
Not Hurtful, Though It is Man’s Duty as Far as Possible to Avoid
It.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xix-p2"></span>For although we ought with the greatest
possible care to avoid error, not only in great but even in little
things, and although we cannot err except through ignorance, it does not
follow that, if a man is ignorant of a thing, he must forthwith fall
into error. That is rather the fate of the man who thinks he knows what
he does not know. For he accepts what is false as if it were true, and
that is the essence of error. But it is a point of very great importance
what the subject is in regard to which a man makes a mistake. For on one
and the same subject we rightly prefer an instructed man to an ignorant
one, and a man who is not in error to one who is. In the case of
different subjects, however,—that is, when one man knows one thing, and
another a different thing, and when what the former knows is useful, and
what the latter knows is not so useful, or is actually hurtful,—who
would not, in regard to the things the latter knows, prefer the
ignorance of the former to the knowledge of the latter? For there are
points on which ignorance is better than knowledge. And in the same way,
it has sometimes been an advantage to depart from the right way,—in
travelling, however, not in morals. It has happened to myself to take
the wrong road where two ways met, so that I did not pass by the place
where an armed band of Donatists lay in wait for me. Yet I arrived at
the place whither I was bent, though by a roundabout route; and when I
heard of the ambush, I congratulated myself on my mistake, and gave
thanks to God for it. Now, who would not rather be the traveller who
made a mistake like this, than the highwayman who made no mistake? And
hence, perhaps, it is that the prince of poets puts these words into the
mouth of a lover in misery: <span id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110.md)
“How I am undone, how I have been carried away by an evil error!” for
there is an error which is good, as it not merely does no harm, but
produces some actual advantage. But when we look more closely into the
nature of truth, and consider that to err is just to take the false for
the true, and the true for the false, or to hold what is certain as
uncertain, and what is uncertain as certain, and that error in the soul
is hideous and repulsive just in proportion as it appears fair and
plausible when we utter it, or assent to it, saying, “Yea, yea; Nay,
nay,”—surely this life that we live is wretched indeed, if only on this
account, that sometimes, in order to preserve it, it is necessary to
fall into error. God forbid that such should be that other life, where
truth itself is the life of the soul, where no one deceives, and no one
is deceived. But here men deceive and are deceived, and they are more to
be pitied when they lead others astray than when they are themselves led
astray by putting trust in liars. Yet so much does a rational soul
shrink from what is false, and so earnestly does it struggle against
error, that even those who love to deceive are most unwilling to be
deceived. For the liar does not <span id="page_243">p. 243</span> <span
id="iv.ii.xix-Page_243"></span>think that he errs, but that he leads
another who trusts him into error. And certainly he does not err in
regard to the matter about which he lies, if he himself knows the truth;
but he is deceived in this, that he thinks his lie does him no harm,
whereas every sin is more hurtful to the sinner than to the sinned
against.
