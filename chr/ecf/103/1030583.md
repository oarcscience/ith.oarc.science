<span id="v.iii.xxx-p1"></span> 29. But, lo, That Lamb goeth by a Virgin
road, how shall they go after Him, who have lost what there is no way
for them to recover? Do ye, therefore, do ye go after Him, His virgins;
do ye thither also go after Him, in that on this one account
whithersoever He shall have gone, ye follow Him: for unto any other gift
whatsoever of holiness, whereby to follow Him, we can exhort married
persons, save this which they have lost beyond power of recovery. Do ye,
therefore, follow Him, by holding with perseverance what ye have vowed
with ardor. Go when ye can, that the good of virginity perish not from
you, unto which ye can do nothing, in order that it may return. The rest
of the multitude of the faithful will see you, which cannot unto this
follow the Lamb; it will see you, it will not envy you: and by rejoicing
together with you, what it hath not in itself, it will have in you. For
that new song also, which is your own, it will not be able to utter; but
it will not be unable to hear, and to be delighted with your so
excellent good: but ye, who shall both utter and hear, in that what ye
shall say, this ye shall hear of yourselves, will exult with greater
happiness, and reign with greater joy. But they will have no sorrow on
account of your greater joy, to whom this shall be wanting. Forsooth
That Lamb, Whom ye shall follow whithersoever He shall have gone, will
not desert those who cannot follow Him, where you can. Almighty is the
Lamb, of Whom we speak. He both will go before you, and will not depart
from them, when God shall be all in all. <span
id="fr_2090"></span>[2091](#fn_2090) And they, who shall have less,
shall not turn away in dislike from you: for, where there is no envying,
difference exists with concord. Take to you, <span
id="fr_2091"></span>[2092](#fn_2091) then, have trust, be strong,
continue, ye who vow and pay unto the Lord your God vows of perpetual
continence, not for the sake of this present world, but for the sake of
the kingdom of Heaven.
