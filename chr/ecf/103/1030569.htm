<p class="c10"><a name="v.iii.xvi-p1"></A>  15. After that the same Apostle adds, and says, &#8220;Thou art bound to a wife, seek not loosening: thou art loosed from a wife, seek not a wife.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2049"></A><A HREF="#fn_2049"><FONT SIZE="1">2050</FONT></A>
 Of these two, that, which be set first, pertains unto command, against which it is not lawful to do. For it is not lawful to put away a wife, save because of fornication,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2050"></A><A HREF="#fn_2050"><FONT SIZE="1">2051</FONT></A>
 as the Lord Himself saith in the Gospel. But that, which he added, &#8220;Thou art loosed from a wife, seek not a wife,&#8221; is a sentence of counsel, not of command; therefore it is lawful to do, but it is better not to do. Lastly, he added straightway, &#8220;Both if thou shalt have taken a wife, thou hast not sinned; and, if a virgin shall have been married, she sinneth not.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2051"></A><A HREF="#fn_2051"><FONT SIZE="1">2052</FONT></A>
 But, after that former saying of his, &#8220;Thou art bound to a wife, seek not loosening,&#8221; he added not, did he, &#8220;And if thou shalt have loosed, thou hast not sinned?&#8221; For he had already said above, &#8220;But to these, who are in marriage, I command, not I, but the Lord, that the wife depart not from her husband: but, if she shall have departed, that she remain unmarried, or be reconciled unto her own husband;&#8221; for it may come to pass that she depart, not through any fault of her own, but of her husband. Then he saith, &#8220;And let not the man put away his wife,&#8221; which, nevertheless, he set down of command of the Lord: nor did he then add, And, if he shall have put her away, he sinneth not. For this is a command, not to obey which is sin: not a counsel, which if you shall be unwilling to use, you will obtain less good, not do any ill. On this account, after he had said, &#8220;Thou art loosed from a wife, seek not a wife;&#8221; because he was not giving command, in order that there be not evil done, but was giving counsel, in order that there be done what is better: straightway he added, &#8220;Both, if thou shall have taken a wife, thou hast not sinned; and, if a virgin shall have been married, she sinneth not.&#8221;</p>
