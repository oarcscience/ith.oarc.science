<span id="iv.i.vi-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv.i.vi-p3"></span>Explains for what the Son of God was sent,
viz, that by Christ’s dying for sinners, we were to be convinced how
great is God’s love for us, and also what manner of men we are whom He
loved. That the Word came in the flesh, to the purpose also of enabling
us to be so cleansed as to contemplate and cleave to God. That our
double death was abolished by His death, being one and single. And
hereupon is discussed, how the single of our Saviour harmonizes to
salvation with our double; and the perfection is treated at length of
the senary number, to which the ratio itself of single to double is
reducible. That all are gathered together from many into one by the one
Mediator of life, viz. Christ, through Whom alone is wrought the true
cleansing of the soul. Further it is demonstrated that the Son of God,
although made less by being sent, on account of the form of a servant
which He took, is not therefore less than the Father according to the
form of God, because He was sent by Himself: and that the same account
is to be given of the sending of the Holy Spirit.
