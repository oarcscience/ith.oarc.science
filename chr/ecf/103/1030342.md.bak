id="iv.ii.xciv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 92.—The Resurrection of the
Lost.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xciv-p2"></span>But as for those who, out of the mass of
perdition caused by the first man’s sin, are not redeemed through the
one Mediator between God and man, they too shall rise again, each with
his own body, but only to be punished with the devil and his angels.
Now, whether they shall rise again with all their diseases and
deformities of body, bringing with them the diseased and deformed limbs
which they possessed here, it would be labor lost to inquire. For we
need not weary ourselves speculating about their health or their beauty,
which are matters uncertain, when their eternal damnation is a matter of
certainty. Nor need we inquire in what sense their body shall be
incorruptible, if it be susceptible of pain; or in what sense
corruptible, if it be free from the possibility of death. For there is
no true life except where there is happiness in life, and no true
incorruption except where health is unbroken by any pain. When, however,
the unhappy are not permitted to die, then, if I may so speak, death
itself dies not; and where pain without intermission afflicts the <span

and never comes to an end, corruption itself is not completed. This is
called in Holy Scripture “the second death.” <span
