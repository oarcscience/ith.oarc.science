in Love Must Be Considered. <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704.md)
</span>

<span id="iv.i.xi.ii-p6"></span>2. And this being so, let us direct our
attention to those three things which we fancy we have found. We are not
yet speaking of heavenly things, nor yet of God the Father, and Son, and
Holy Spirit, but of that inadequate image, which yet is an image, that
is, man; for our feeble mind perhaps can gaze upon this more familiarly
and more easily. Well then, when I, who make this inquiry, love
anything, there are three things concerned—myself, and that which I
love, and love itself. For I do not love love, except I love a lover;
for there is no love where nothing is loved. Therefore there are three
things—he who loves, and that which is loved, and love. But what if I
love none except myself? Will there not then be two things—that which I
love, and love? For he who loves and that which is loved are the same
when any one loves himself; just as to love and to be loved, in the same
way, is the very same thing when any one loves himself. Since the same
thing is said, when it is said, he loves himself, and he is loved by
himself. For in that case to love and to be loved are not two different
things: just as he who loves and he who is loved are not two different
persons. But yet, even so, love and what is loved are still two things.
For there is no love when any one loves himself, except when love itself
is loved. But it is one thing to love one’s self, another to love one’s
own love. For love is not loved, unless as already loving something;
since where nothing is loved there is no love. Therefore there are two
things when any one loves himself—love, and that which is loved. For
then he that loves and that which is loved are one. Whence it seems that
it does not follow that three things are to be understood wherever love
is. For let us put aside from the inquiry all the other many things of
which a man consists; and in order that we may discover clearly what we
are now seeking, as far as in such a subject is possible, let us treat
of the mind alone. The mind, then, when it loves itself, discloses two
things—mind and love. But what is to love one’s self, except to wish to
help one’s self to the enjoyment of self? And when any one wishes
himself to be just as much as he is, then the will is on a par with the
mind, and the love is equal to him who loves. And if love is a
substance, it is certainly not body, but spirit; and the mind also is
not body, but spirit. Yet love and mind are not two spirits, but one
spirit; nor yet two essences, but one: and yet here are two things that
are one, he that loves and love; or, if you like so to put it, that
which is loved and love. And these two, indeed, are mutually said
relatively. Since he who loves is referred to love, and love to him who
loves. For he who loves, loves with some love, and love is the love of
some one who loves. But mind and spirit are not said relatively, but
express essence. For mind and spirit do not exist because the mind and
spirit of some particular man exists. For if we subtract the body from
that which is man, which is so called with the conjunction of body, the
mind and spirit remain. But if we subtract him that loves, then there is
no love; and if we subtract love, then there is no one that loves. And
therefore, in so far as they are mutually referred to one another, they
are two; but whereas they are spoken in re<span id="page_127">p.
127</span> <span id="iv.i.xi.ii-Page_127"></span>spect to themselves,
each are spirit, and both together also are one spirit; and each are
mind, and both together one mind. Where, then, is the trinity? Let us
attend as much as we can, and let us invoke the everlasting light, that
He may illuminate our darkness, and that we may see in ourselves, as
much as we are permitted, the image of God.

<span id="iv.i.xi.ii-p2"></span> \[Augustin here begins his discussion
of some ternaries that are found in the Finite, that illustrate the
trinality of the Infinite. Like all finite analogies, they fail at
certain points. In the case chosen—namely, the lover, the loved, and
love—the first two are substances, the last is not. The mind is a
substance, but its activity in loving is not. In chapter iv. 5, Augustin
asserts that “love and knowledge exist substantially, as the mind itself
does.” But no psychology, ancient or modern, has ever maintained that
the agencies of a spiritual entity or substance are themselves spiritual
entity or substances. The activities of the human mind in cognizing,
loving, etc., are only its energizing, not its substance.

<span id="iv.i.xi.ii-p3"></span>The ambiguity of the Latin contributes
to this error. The mind and its loving, and also the mind and its
cognizing, are denominated “*duo quædam*” the mind, love, and knowledge,
are denominated “*tria quædem*.” By bringing the mind and its love and
knowledge under the one term “*quædam*,” and then giving the meaning of
“substance” to “thing,” in “something,” the result follows that all
three are alike and equally “substantial.”

<span id="iv.i.xi.ii-p4"></span>This analogy taken from the mind and its
activities illustrates the trinality of the Divine essence, but fails to
illustrate the substantiality of the three persons. The three Divine
persons are not the Divine essence together with two of its activities
(such, *e.g*., as creation and redemption), but the essence in three
modes, or “forms,” as St. Paul denominates them in [Phil.
3.6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.i.xi.ii-p4.1"></span>[Phil. iii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.i.xi.ii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iv.i.xi.ii-p5"></span>If Augustin could prove his assertion
that the activities of the human spirit in knowing and loving are
strictly “substantial,” then this ternary would illustrate not only the
trinality of the essence, but the essentiality and objectivity of the
persons. The fact which he mentions, that knowledge and love are
*inseparable* from the knowing and loving mind, does not prove their
equal substantiality with the mind.—W.G.T.S.\]
