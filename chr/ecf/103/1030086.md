id="iv.i.vii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—The Three Persons Not Properly
So Called \[in a Human Sense\].</span>

<span id="iv.i.vii.ix-p2"></span>But because with us the usage has
already obtained, that by essence we understand the same thing which is
understood by substance; we do not dare to say one essence, three
substances, but one essence or substance and three persons: as many
writers in Latin, who treat of these things, and are of authority, have
said, in that they could not find any other more suitable way by which
to enunciate in words that which they understood without words. For, in
truth, as the Father is not the Son, and the Son is not the Father, and
that Holy Spirit who is also called the gift of God is neither the
Father nor the Son, certainly they are three. And so it is said
plurally, “I and my Father are one.” <span
id="fr_581"></span>[582](#fn_581) For He has not said, “*is* one,” as
the Sabellians say; but, “*are* one.” Yet, when the question is asked,
What three? human language labors altogether under great poverty of
speech. The answer, however, is given, three “persons,” not that it
might be \[completely\] spoken, but that it might not be left \[wholly\]
unspoken.
