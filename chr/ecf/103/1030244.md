<span id="iv.i.xvii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—The Question Why the Holy
Spirit is Not Begotten, and How He Proceeds from the Father and the Son,
Will Only Be Understood When We are in Bliss.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xxv-p2"></span>For if any belong to Him, although
far duller in intellect than those, yet when they are freed from the
body at the end of this life, the envious powers have no right to hold
them. For that Lamb that was slain by them without any debt of sin has
conquered them; but not by the might of power before He had done so by
the righteousness of blood. And free accordingly from the power of the
devil, they are borne up by holy angels, being set free from all evils
by the mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus. <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043.md) Since by the harmonious testimony
of the Divine Scriptures, both Old and New, both those by which Christ
was foretold, and those by which He was announced, there is no other
name under heaven whereby men must be saved. <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044.md) And when purged from all contagion
of corruption, they are placed in peaceful abodes until they take their
bodies again, their own, but now incorruptible, to adorn, not to burden
them. For this is the will of the best and most wise Creator, that the
spirit of a man, when piously subject to God, should have a body happily
subject, and that this happiness should last for ever.

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xxv-p5"></span>45. There we shall see the truth
without any difficulty, and shall enjoy it to the full, most clear and
most certain. Nor shall we be inquiring into anything by a mind that
reasons, but shall discern by a mind that contemplates, why the Holy
Spirit is not a Son, although He proceeds from the Father. In that light
there will be no place for inquiry: but here, by experience itself it
has appeared to me so difficult,—as beyond doubt it will likewise appear
to them also who shall carefully and intelligently read what I have
written,—that although in the second book <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md) I promised that I would speak
thereof in another place, yet as often as I have desired to illustrate
it by the creaturely image of it which we ourselves are, so often, let
my meaning be of what sort it might, did adequate utterance entirely
fail me; nay, even in my very meaning I felt that I had attained to
endeavor rather than accomplishment. I had indeed found in one person,
such as is a man, an image of that Highest Trinity, and had desired,
especially in the ninth book, to illustrate and render more intelligible
the relation of the Three Persons by that which is subject to time and
change. But three things belonging to one person cannot suit those Three
Persons, as man’s purpose demands; and this we have demonstrated in this
fifteenth book.
