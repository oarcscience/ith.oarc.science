<span id="v.iv.xxvi-p1"></span> 25. The past day returns not hereafter,
and after yesterday proceeds to-day, and after to-day will proceed
to-morrow; and, lo, all times and the things of time pass away, that
there may come the promise that shall abide; and “whoso shall have
persevered even unto the end, this one shall be saved.” <span
id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286.md) If the world is now perishing, the
married woman, for whom beareth she? Or in heart about to bear, and in
flesh not about to bear, why doth she marry? But if the world is still
about to last, why is not He more loved, by Whom the world was made? If
already enticements of this life are failing, there is not any thing for
a Christian soul with desire to seek after; but if they shall yet
remain, there is what with holiness he may despise. For the one of these
two there is no hope of lust, in the other greater glory of charity. How
many or how long are the very years, in which the flower of carnal age
seems to flourish? Some females having thoughts of marriage, and with
ardor wishing it, whilst they are being despised or put off, on a sudden
have grown old, so as that now they would feel shame, rather than
desire, to marry. But many having married, their husbands having set out
into distant countries very soon after their union, have grown aged
expecting their return, and, as though soon left widows, at times have
not even attained so as at least as old women to receive their old men
on their return. If therefore, when betrothed bridegrooms despised or
delayed, or when husbands were abroad, carnal desire could be restrained
from commission of fornication or adultery, why cannot it be restrained
from commission of sacrilege? If it hath been repressed, when being
deferred it was glowing, why is it not put down, when having been cut
off it had grown cold? For they in greater measure endure glowing of
desire, who despair not of the pleasure of the same desire. But whoso of
unmarried persons vow chastity to God, withdraw that very hope, which is
the fuel of love. Hence with more ease is desire bridled, which is
kindled by no expectation; and yet, unless against this prayer be made,
in order to overcome it, itself as unlawful is the more ardently wished
for.
