<span id="iv.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Of the Way to Commence the
Catechetical Instruction, and of the Narration of Facts from the History
of the World’s Creation on to the Present Times of the Church.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p2"></span>10. But if it happens that his answer is
to the effect that he has met with some divine warning, or with some
divine terror, prompting him to become a Christian, this opens up the
way most satisfactorily for a commencement to our discourse, by
suggesting the greatness of God’s interest in us. His thoughts, <span
id="page_289">p. 289</span> <span
id="iv.iii.vii-Page_289"></span>however, ought certainly to be turned
away from this line of things, whether miracles or dreams, and directed
to the more solid path and the surer oracles of the Scriptures; so that
he may also come to understand how mercifully that warning was
administered to him in advance, <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373.md) previous to his giving himself to
the Holy Scriptures. And assuredly it ought to be pointed out to him,
that the Lord Himself would neither thus have admonished him and urged
him on to become a Christian, and to be incorporated into the Church,
nor have taught him by such signs or revelations, had it not been His
will that, for his greater safety and security, he should enter upon a
pathway already prepared in the Holy Scriptures, in which he should not
seek after visible miracles, but learn the habit of hoping for things
invisible, and in which also he should receive monitions not in sleep
but in wakefulness. At this point the narration ought now to be
commenced, which should start with the fact that God made all things
very good, <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374.md) and which should
be continued, as we have said, on to the present times of the Church.
This should be done in such a manner as to give, for each of the affairs
and events which we relate, causes and reasons by which we may refer
them severally to that end of love from which neither the eye of the man
who is occupied in doing anything, nor that of the man who is engaged in
speaking, ought to be turned away. For if, even in handling the fables
of the poets, which are but fictitious creations and things devised for
the pleasure <span id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375.md) of minds whose
food is found in trifles, those grammarians who have the reputation and
the name of being good do nevertheless endeavor to bring them to bear
upon some kind of (assumed) use, although that use itself may be only
something vain and grossly bent upon the coarse nutriment of this
world: <span id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376.md) how much more careful
does it become us to be, not to let those genuine verities which we
narrate, in consequence of any want of a well-considered account of
their causes, be accepted either with a gratification which issues in no
practical good, or, still less, with a cupidity which may prove hurtful!
At the same time, we are not to set forth these causes in such a manner
as to leave the proper course of our narration, and let our heart and
our tongue indulge in digressions into the knotty questions of more
intricate discussion. But the simple truth of the explanation which we
adduce <span id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377.md) ought to be like the
gold which binds together a row of gems, and yet does not interfere with
the choice symmetry of the ornament by any undue intrusion of
itself. <span id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md)
