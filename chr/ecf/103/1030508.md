<span id="v.i.xxv"></span>

<span id="v.i.xxv-p1"></span> 25. But, say they, how is the flesh by a
certain likeness compared unto the Church? What! doth the Church lust
against Christ? whereas the same Apostle said, “The Church is subject
unto Christ.” <span id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897.md) Clearly the
Church is subject unto Christ; because the spirit therefore lusteth
against the flesh, that on every side the Church may be made subject
<span id="page_390">p. 390</span> <span id="v.i.xxv-Page_390"></span>to
Christ; but the flesh lusteth against the spirit, because not as yet
hath the Church received that peace which was promised perfect. And for
this reason the Church is made subject unto Christ for the pledge of
salvation, and the flesh lusteth against the spirit from the weakness of
sickness. For neither were those other than members of the Church, unto
whom he thus spake, “Walk in the spirit, and fulfill not the lusts of
the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit
against the flesh; for these are opposed the one to the other; that ye
do not what we would.” <span id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898.md) These
things were assuredly spoken unto the Church, which if it were not made
subject unto Christ, the spirit would not in it lust against the flesh
through continence. By reason of which they were indeed able not to
perfect the lusts of the flesh, but through the flesh lusting against
the Spirit they were not able to do the things which they would, that
is, not even to have the very lusts of the flesh. Lastly, why should we
not confess that in spiritual men the Church is subject unto Christ, but
in carnal men yet lusteth against Christ? Did not they lust against
Christ unto whom it was said, “Is Christ divided?” <span
id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899.md) and, “I could not speak unto you as
unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. I have given unto you milk to drink
as unto babes in Christ, not meat, for ye were not as yet able; but not
even now are ye able: for ye are still carnal. For whereas there is
among you emulation, and strife, are ye not carnal?” <span
id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900.md) Against whom doth emulation and
strife lust, but against Christ? For these lusts of the flesh Christ
healeth in His own, but loveth in none. Whence the holy Church, so long
as it hath such members, is not yet without spot or wrinkle. To these
are added those other sins also, for which the daily cry of the whole
Church is, “Forgive us our debts:” <span
id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901.md) and, that we should not think
spiritual persons exempt from these, not any one soever of carnal
persons, nor any one soever of spiritual persons themselves, but he, who
lay on the breast of the Lord, <span
id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902.md) and whom He loved before others,
saith, “If we shall say that we have not sin, we deceive ourselves, and
the truth is not in us.” <span id="fr_1903"></span>[1904](#fn_1903.md) But
in every sin, more in what is greater, less in what is less, there is an
act of lust against righteousness. And of Christ it is written: “Who was
made unto us by God, Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and
Redemption.” <span id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904.md) In every sin
therefore without doubt there is an act of lust against Christ. But when
He, Who “healeth all our sicknesses,” <span
id="fr_1905"></span>[1906](#fn_1905.md) shall have led His Church unto the
promised healing of sickness, then in none of its members shall there be
any, even the very least spot or wrinkle. Then in no way shall the flesh
lust against the spirit, and therefore there shall be no cause why the
spirit also lust against the flesh. Then all this conflict shall come to
an end, then there shall be the highest concord of both substances; then
to such a degree shall no one there be carnal, that even the flesh
itself shall be spiritual. What therefore each one living after Christ
doth with his flesh, whereas he both lusts against its evil lust, which
he restrains, hereafter to be healed, which he holds, not yet healed;
and yet nourisheth and cherisheth its good nature, since “no one ever
hated his own flesh,” <span id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906.md) this
also Christ doth with the Church, so far as it is lawful to compare
lesser with greater matters. For He both represses it with rebukes, that
it burst not being puffed up with impunity; and raises it up with
consolations, that it sink not being weighed down with infirmity. Hence
is that of the Apostle, “For if we would judge ourselves, we should not
be judged; but when we are judged, we are rebuked of the Lord, that we
be not condemned with this world.” <span
id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907.md) And that in the Psalm, “After the
multitude of my griefs in my heart, Thy consolations have gladdened my
soul.” <span id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908.md) We are therefore then
to hope for perfect soundness of our flesh without any opposition, when
there shall be sure security of the Church of Christ without any fear.
