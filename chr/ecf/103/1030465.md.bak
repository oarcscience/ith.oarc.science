<span id="iv.vii.i-p1"></span> 1. <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.vii.i-p1.1"></span> Receive</span>, my children, the Rule of
Faith, which is called the Symbol (or Creed <span
id="fr_1761"></span>[1762](#fn_1761) .md). And when ye have received it,
write it in your heart, and be daily saying it to yourselves; before ye
sleep, before ye go forth, arm you with your Creed. The Creed no man
writes so as it may be able to be read: but for rehearsal of it, lest
haply forgetfulness obliterate what care hath delivered, let your memory
be your record-roll: <span id="fr_1762"></span>[1763](#fn_1762.md) what ye
are about to hear, that are ye to believe; and what ye shall have
believed, that are about to give back with your tongue. For the Apostle
says, “With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the
mouth confession is made unto salvation.” <span
id="fr_1763"></span>[1764](#fn_1763.md) For this is the Creed which ye are
to rehearse and to repeat in answer. These words which ye have heard are
in the Divine Scriptures scattered up and down: but thence gathered and
reduced into one, that the memory of slow persons might not be
distressed; that every person may be able to say, able to hold, what he
believes. For have ye now merely heard that God is Almighty? But ye
begin to have him for your father, when ye have been born by the church
as your Mother.
