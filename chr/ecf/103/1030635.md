<span id="v.iv.xxiii-p1"></span> 22. Now it has been my wish on this
account to say something on this subject, by reason of certain of our
brethren most friendly and dear to us, and without willful guilt indeed
entangled in this error, but yet entangled; who think, that, when they
exhort any to righteousness and piety, their exhortation will not have
force, unless the whole of that, wherein they would work upon man that
man should work, they set in the power of man, not helped by the grace
of God, but put forth by the alone choice of the free will; as though
there can be free will to perform a good work, unless set free by the
gift of God! And they mark not that this very thing themselves also have
by the gift of God, that with such power they exhort, as to excite the
dull wills of men to enter upon a good life, to enkindle the cold, to
correct such as are in error, to convert such as are turned aside, to
pacify such as are opposed. For thus they are able to succeed in
persuading what they would persuade to, or if they work not these things
in the wills of men, what is their work? wherefore speak they? Let them
leave them rather to their own choice. But if in them they work these
things, what? I pray, doth man, in the will of man, work so great things
by speaking, and doth God work nothing there by helping? Yea rather,
with how great soever power of discourse man may prevail, as that by
skill of discussion, and sweetness of speech, he in the will of man
implant truth, nourish charity, by teaching remove error, by exhortation
remove sloth, “Neither he who planteth is any thing, nor he who
watereth, but God Who giveth the increase.” <span

all means without, unless the Creator should work secretly within. I
hope therefore that this letter of mine by the worthy deed <span
id="fr_2275"></span>[2276](#fn_2275) of your Excellence will soon come
into the hands of such also; on this account I thought that I ought to
say something on this subject. Next that both you yourself, and
whatsoever other widows shall read this, or hear it read, may know that
you make more advance unto the love and profession of the good of
continence by your own prayers than by our exhortations; forasmuch as if
it be any help to you that our addresses also are supplied to you, the
whole must be assigned to His grace, “in Whose Hand,” as it is written,
“are both we and our discourses.” <span
