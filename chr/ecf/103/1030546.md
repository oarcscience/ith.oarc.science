<span id="v.ii.xxx-p1"></span> 29. And there is this further, that men
are not rightly compared with men in regard of some one good. For it may
come to pass, that one hath not what another hath, but hath another
thing, which must be esteemed of more value. The good of obedience is
better than of continence. For marriage is in no place condemned by
authority of our Scriptures, but disobedience is in no place acquitted.
If therefore there be set before us a virgin about to continue so, but
yet disobedient, and a married woman who could not continue a virgin,
but yet obedient, which shall we call better? shall it be (the one) less
praiseworthy, than if she were a virgin, or (the other) worthy of blame,
even as she is a virgin? So, if you compare a drunken virgin with a
sober married woman, who can doubt to pass the same sentence? Forsooth
marriage and virginity are two goods, whereof the one is greater; but
sobriety and drunkenness, even as obedience and stubbornness, are, the
one good, and the other evil. But it is better to have all goods even in
a less degree, than great good with great evil: forasmuch as in the
goods of the body also it is better to have the stature of Zacchæus with
sound health, than that of Goliah with fever.
