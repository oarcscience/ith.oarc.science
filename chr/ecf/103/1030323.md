<span id="iv.ii.lxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 73.—The Greatest of All Alms is to
Forgive Our Debtors and to Love Our Enemies.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxv-p2"></span>But none of those is greater than to
forgive from the heart a sin that has been committed against us. For it
is a comparatively small thing to wish well to, or even to do good to, a
man who has done no evil to you. It is a much higher thing, and is the
result of the most exalted goodness, to love your enemy, and always to
wish well to, and when you have the opportunity, to do good to, the man
who wishes you ill, and, when he can, does you harm. This is to obey the
command of God: “Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and
pray for them which persecute you.” <span
id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233) But seeing that this is a frame of
mind only reached by the perfect sons of God, and that though every
believer ought to strive after it, and by prayer to God and earnest
struggling with himself endeavor to bring his soul up to this standard,
yet a degree of goodness so high can hardly belong to so great a
multitude as we believe are heard when they use this petition, “Forgive
us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;” in view of all this, it cannot
be doubted that the implied undertaking is fulfilled if a man, though he
has not yet attained to loving his enemy, yet, when asked by one who has
sinned against him to forgive him his sin, does forgive him from his
heart. For he certainly desires to be himself forgiven when he prays,
“as we forgive our debtors,” that is, Forgive us our debts when we beg
forgiveness, as we forgive our debtors when they beg forgiveness from
us.
