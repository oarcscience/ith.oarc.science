<span id="v.iii.viii-p1"></span> 7. I have said this, lest haply married
fruitfulness dare to vie with virgin chastity, and to set forth Mary
herself, and to say unto the virgins of God, She had in her flesh two
things worthy of honor, virginity and fruitfulness; inasmuch as she both
continued a virgin, and bore: this happiness, since we could not both
have the whole, we have divided, that ye be virgins, we be mothers: for
what is wanting to you in children, let your virginity, that hath been
preserved, be a consolation: for us, let the gain of children make up
for our lost virginity. This speech of faithful women married, unto holy
virgins, would any how be to be endured, if they gave birth to
Christians in the flesh; that in this alone, save virginity, the
fruitfulness of Mary in the flesh should be more excellent, that she
gave birth to the Head Himself of these members, but they to the members
of That Head: but now, although by this speech there vie such as on this
one account wed and have intercourse with husbands, that they may have
sons, and have no other thought of their sons, than to gain them for
Christ, and do this so soon as they can: yet are not Christians born of
their flesh, but made so afterwards: the Church giving them birth,
through this, that in a spiritual manner she is the mother of the
members of Christ, of Whom also after a spiritual manner she is the
virgin. And unto this holy birth mothers also who have not borne in the
flesh Christians, are workers together, that they may become what they
know that they could not give birth to in the flesh: yet are they
workers together through this, wherein themselves also are virgins and
mothers <span id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035.md) of Christ, that is to
say, in “faith which worketh through love.” <span

<span id="v.iii.viii-p2"></span> It has been proposed to omit “*que*,”
making the sense, “wherein the virgins themselves also are mothers of
Christ,” but the sense is good as it stands.
