<span id="v.ii.xxxvi-p1"></span> 35. Boys also and virgins dedicating
unto God actual chastity we do before all things admonish, that they be
aware that they must guard their life meanwhile upon earth with so great
humility, by how much the more what they have vowed is heavenly.
Forsooth it is written, “How great soever thou art, by so much humble
thyself in all things.” <span id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022.md)
Therefore it is our part to say something of their greatness, it is
their part to have thought of great humility. Therefore, except certain,
those holy fathers and mothers who were married, than whom these
although they be not married are not better, for this reason, that, if
they were married, they would not be equal, let them not doubt that they
surpass all the rest of this time, either married, or after trial made
of marriage, exercising continence; not so far as Anna surpasses
Susanna; but so far as Mary surpasses both. I am speaking of what
pertains unto the holy chastity itself of the flesh; for who knows not,
what other deserts Mary hath? Therefore let them add to this so high
purpose conduct suitable, that they may have an assured security of the
surpassing reward; knowing of a truth, that, unto themselves and unto
all the faithful, beloved and chosen members of Christ, coming many from
the East, and from the West, although shining with light of glory that
differeth one from another, according to their deserts, there is this
great gift bestowed in common, to sit down in the kingdom of God with
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, <span
id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023.md) who not for the sake of this world,
but for the sake of Christ, were husbands, for the sake of Christ were
fathers.
