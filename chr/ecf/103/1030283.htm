<p class="c39"><a name="iv.ii.xxxv-p1"></A>  <span class="c2"><a name="iv.ii.xxxv-p1.1"></A>Chapter 33.&#8212;Men, Being by Nature the Children of Wrath, Needed a Mediator. In What Sense God is Said to Be Angry.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.ii.xxxv-p2"></A>And so the human race was lying under a just condemnation, and all men were the children of wrath. Of which wrath it is written: &#8220;All our days are passed away in Thy wrath; we spend our years as a tale that is told.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1139"></A><A HREF="#fn_1139"><FONT SIZE="1">1140</FONT></A>
 Of which wrath also Job says: &#8220;Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1140"></A><A HREF="#fn_1140"><FONT SIZE="1">1141</FONT></A>
 Of which wrath also the Lord Jesus says: &#8220;He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1141"></A><A HREF="#fn_1141"><FONT SIZE="1">1142</FONT></A>
 He does not say it will come, but it &#8220;abideth on him.&#8221; For every man is born with it; wherefore the apostle says: &#8220;We were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1142"></A><A HREF="#fn_1142"><FONT SIZE="1">1143</FONT></A>
 Now, as men were lying under this wrath by reason of their original sin, and as this original sin was the <A NAME="page_249"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 249</FONT></A> <a name="iv.ii.xxxv-Page_249"></A>more heavy and deadly in proportion to the number and magnitude of the actual sins which were added to it, there was need for a Mediator, that is, for a reconciler, who, by the offering of one sacrifice, of which all the sacrifices of the law and the prophets were types, should take away this wrath. Wherefore the apostle says: &#8220;For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1143"></A><A HREF="#fn_1143"><FONT SIZE="1">1144</FONT></A>
 Now when God is said to be angry, we do not attribute to Him such a disturbed feeling as exists in the mind of an angry man; but we call His just displeasure against sin by the name &#8220;anger,&#8221; a word transferred by analogy from human emotions. But our being reconciled to God through a Mediator, and receiving the Holy Spirit, so that we who were enemies are made sons (&#8220;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1144"></A><A HREF="#fn_1144"><FONT SIZE="1">1145</FONT></A>
): this is the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
