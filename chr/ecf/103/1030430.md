<span id="iv.vi.iv-p1"></span> 3. But why do I not make answer to
myself, that these fair and clever similies, and charges of this nature
may be poured forth against all who are teachers of any thing by any
adversary, with abundance of wit and sarcasm? But I thought that I ought
to insert something of this kind in my letter, in order to admonish them
to give over such proceedings; so that, as he <span
id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695) says, apart from trifles of
common-places, matter may contend with matter, cause with cause, reason
with reason. Wherefore let them give over that saying, which they have
in their mouths as though of necessity, when any one, who hath been for
some long time a hearer, hath left them; “The Light hath made a passage
through him.” For you see, you who are my chief care, (for I am not over
anxious about them,) how empty this is, and most easy for any one to
find fault with. Therefore I leave this for your own wisdom to consider.
For I have no fear that you will think me possessed by indwelling Light,
when I was entangled in the life of this world, having a darkened hope,
of beauty of wife, of pomp of riches, of emptiness of honors, and of all
other hurtful and deadly pleasures. For all these, as is not unknown to
you, I ceased not to desire and hope for, at the time when I was their
attentive hearer. And I do not lay this to the charge of their teaching;
for I also confess that they also carefully advise to shun these. But
now to say that I am deserted by light, when I have turned myself from
all these shadows of things, and have determined to be content with that
diet merely which is necessary for health of body; but that I was
enlightened and shining, at a time when I loved these things, and was
wrapped up in <span id="page_349">p. 349</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iv-Page_349"></span>them, is the part of a man, to use the
mildest expression, wanting in a keen insight into matters, on which he
loves to speak at length. But, if you please, let us come to the cause
in hand.
