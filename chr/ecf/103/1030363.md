id="iv.ii.cxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 113.—The Death of the Wicked Shall Be
Eternal in the Same Sense as the Life of the Saints.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cxv-p2"></span>This perpetual death of the wicked, then,
that is, their alienation from the life of God, shall abide for ever,
and shall be common to them all, whatever men, prompted by their human
affections, may conjecture as to a variety of punishments, or as to a
mitigation or intermission of their woes; just as the eternal life of
the saints shall abide for ever, and shall be common to them all,
whatever grades of rank and honor there may be among those who shine
with an harmonious effulgence.
