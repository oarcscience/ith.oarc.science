<span id="v.vii.xli"></span>

<span id="v.vii.xli-p1"></span> 40. And then that further device of
theirs, (if words can express it), how painfully ridiculous is it, which
they have invented for defense of their long locks! “A man,” say they,
“the Apostle hath forbidden to have long hair: but then they who have
made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of God are no longer men.” O
dotage unparalleled! Well may the person who says this arm himself
against Holy Scripture’s most manifest proclamations, with counsel of
outrageous impiety, and persevere in a tortuous path, and essay to bring
in a pestiferous doctrine that not “Blessed is the man who hath not
walked in the counsel of the ungodly, and in the way of sinners hath not
stood, and in the chair of noisome wickedness <span
id="fr_2615"></span>[2616](#fn_2615) hath not sat.” <span
id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616) For if he would meditate in God’s
law day and night, there he should find the Apostle Paul himself, who
assuredly professing highest chastity saith, “I would that all men were
even as I:” and yet shows himself a man, not only in so being, but also
in so speaking. For he saith, “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I
understood as a child, I thought as a child; when I became a man, I put
away childish things.” <span id="fr_2617"></span>[2618](#fn_2617) But
why should I mention the Apostle, when concerning our Lord and Saviour
Himself they know not what they think who say these things. For of Whom
but Him is it said, “Until we come all to unity of faith and to
knowledge of the Son of God, to the Perfect Man, to the measure of the
age of the fullness of Christ; that we be no longer babes, tossed and
carried about with every wind of doctrine, in sleight of men, in cunning
craftiness for machination of error.” <span
id="fr_2618"></span>[2619](#fn_2618) With which sleight these persons
deceive ignorant people, with which cunning craftiness and machinations
of the enemy both they themselves are whirled round, and in their
whirling essay to make the minds of the weak which cohere unto them so
(in a manner) to spin round with them, that they also may not know where
they are. For they have heard or read that which is written, “Whosoever
of you have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ: where is no Jew
nor Greek; no bond nor free; no male nor female.” <span
id="fr_2619"></span>[2620](#fn_2619) And they do not understand that it
is in reference to concupiscence of carnal sex <span
id="fr_2620"></span>[2621](#fn_2620) that this is said, because in the
inner man, wherein we are renewed in newness of our mind, no sex of this
kind exists. Then let them not deny themselves to be men, just because
in respect of their masculine sex they work not. For wedded Christians
also who <span id="page_524">p. 524</span> <span
id="v.vii.xli-Page_524"></span>do this work, are of course not
Christians on the score of that which they have in common with the rest
who are not Christians and with the very cattle. For that is one thing
that is either to infirmity conceded or to mortal propagation paid as a
debt, but another that which for the laying hold of incorrupt and
eternal life is by faithful profession signified. That then which
concerning not veiling of the head is enjoined to men, in the body
indeed it is set forth in a figure, but that it is enacted in the mind,
wherein is the image and glory of God, the words themselves do indicate:
“A man indeed,” it saith, “ought not to veil his head, forsomuch as he
is the image and glory of God.” For where this image is, he doth himself
declare, where he saith, “Lie not one to another; but stripping off the
old man with his deeds, put ye on the new, which is renewed to the
acknowledging of God, according to the image of Him who created
him.” <span id="fr_2621"></span>[2622](#fn_2621) Who can doubt that this
renewing takes place in the mind? But and if any doubt, let him hear a
more open sentence. For, giving the same admonition, he thus saith in
another place: “As is the truth in Jesus, that ye put off concerning the
former conversation the old man, him which is corrupt according to the
lust of deception; but be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put
on the new man, him which after God is created.” <span
id="fr_2622"></span>[2623](#fn_2622) What then? Have women not this
renewal of mind in which is the image of God? Who would say this? But in
the sex of their body they do not signify this; therefore they are
bidden to be veiled. The part, namely, which they signify in the very
fact of their being women, is that which may be called the
concupiscential part, over which the mind <span
id="fr_2623"></span>[2624](#fn_2623) bears rule, itself also subjected
to its God, when life is most rightly and orderly conducted. What,
therefore, in a single individual human being is the mind and the
concupiscence, (that ruling, this ruled; that lord, this subject,) the
same in two human beings, man and woman, is in regard of the sex of the
body exhibited in a figure. Of which sacred import <span
id="fr_2624"></span>[2625](#fn_2624) the Apostle speaks when he says,
that the man ought not to be veiled, the women ought. For the mind doth
the more gloriously advance to higher things, the more diligently the
concupiscence is curbed from lower things; until the whole man together
with even this now mortal and frail body in the last resurrection be
clothed with incorruption and immortality, and death be swallowed up in
victory. <span id="fr_2625"></span>[2626](#fn_2625)
