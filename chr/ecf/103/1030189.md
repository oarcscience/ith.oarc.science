<span id="iv.i.xv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—A Difficulty, How We are
Justitified in the Blood of the Son of God.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xv.xi-p2"></span>15. But what is meant by “justified in
His blood?” What power is there in this blood, I beseech you, that they
who believe should be justified in it? And what is meant by “being
reconciled by the death of His Son?” Was it indeed so, that when God the
Father was wroth with us, He saw the death of His Son for us, and was
appeased towards us? Was then His Son already so far appeased towards
us, that He even deigned to die for us; while the Father was still so
far wroth, that except His Son died for us, He would not be appeased?
And what, then, is that which the same teacher of the Gentiles himself
says in another place: “What shall we then say to these things? If God
be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but
delivered Him up for us all; how has He not with Him also freely given
us all things?” <span id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810) Pray, unless the
Father had been already appeased, would He have delivered up His own
Son, not sparing Him for us? Does not this opinion seem to be as it were
contrary to that? In the one, the Son dies for us, and the Father is
reconciled to us by His death; in the other, as though the Father first
loved us, He Himself on our account does not spare the Son, He Himself
for us delivers Him up to death. But I see that the Father loved us also
before, not only before the Son died for us, but before He created the
world; the apostle himself being witness, who says, “According as He
hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world.” <span
id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811) Nor was the Son delivered up for us as
it were unwillingly, the Father Himself not sparing Him; for it is said
also concerning Him, “Who loved me, and delivered up Himself for
me.” <span id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812) Therefore together both the
Father and the Son, and the Spirit of both, work all things equally and
harmoniously; yet we are justified in the blood of Christ, and we are
reconciled to God by the death of His Son. And I will explain, as I
shall be able, here also, how this was done, as much as may seem
sufficient.
