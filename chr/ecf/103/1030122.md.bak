<span id="iv.i.x.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.x.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Our Love of the Righteous is
Kindled from Love Itself of the Unchangeable Form of
Righteousness.</span>

<span id="iv.i.x.x-p2"></span>13. For why is it, pray, that we burn when
we hear and read, “Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the
day of salvation: giving no offense in anything, that the ministry be
not blamed: but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of
God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in
stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in
fastings; by pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by
the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of
God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by
honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and
yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we
live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing;
as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all
things?” <span id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) Why is it that we are
inflamed with love of the Apostle Paul, when we read these things,
unless that we believe him so to have lived? But we do not believe that
the ministers of God ought so to live because we have heard it from any
one, but because we behold it inwardly within ourselves, or rather above
ourselves, in the truth itself. Him, therefore, whom we believe to have
so lived, we love for that which we see. And except we loved above all
else that form which we discern as always steadfast and unchangeable, we
should not for that reason love him, because we hold fast in our belief
that his life, when he was living in the flesh, was adapted to, and in
harmony with, this form. But somehow we are stirred up the more to the
love of this form itself, through the belief by which we believe some
one to have so lived; and to the hope by which we no more at all
despair, that we, too, are able so to live; we who are men, from this
fact itself, that some men have so lived, so that we both desire this
more ardently, and pray for it more confidently. So both the love of
that form, according to which they are believed to have lived, makes the
life of these men themselves to be loved by us; and their life thus
believed stirs up a more burning love towards that same form; so that
the more ardently we love God, the more certainly and the more calmly do
we see Him, because we behold in God the unchangeable form of
righteousness, according to which we judge that man ought to live.
Therefore faith avails to the knowledge and to the love of God, not as
though of one altogether unknown, or altogether not loved; but so that
thereby He may be known more clearly, and loved more steadfastly.
