<span id="v.viii.iv-p1"></span> 3. Look we then, beloved, what hardships
in labors and sorrows men endure, for things which they viciously love,
and by how much they think to be made by them more happy, by so much
more unhappily covet. How much for false riches, how much for vain
honors, how much for affections of games and shows, is of exceeding
peril and trouble most patiently borne! We see men hankering after
money, glory, lasciviousness, how, that they may arrive at their
desires, and having gotten not lose them, they endure sun, rain, icy
cold, waves, and most stormy tempests, the roughnesses and uncertainties
of wars, the strokes of huge blows, and dreadful wounds, not of
inevitable necessity but of culpable will. But these madnesses are
thought, in a manner, permitted. Thus avarice, ambition, luxury, and the
delights of all sorts of games and shows, unless for them some wicked
deed be committed or outrage which is prohibited by human laws, are
accounted to pertain to innocence: nay moreover, the man who without
wrong to any shall, whether for getting or increasing of money, whether
for obtaining or keeping of honors, whether in contending in the match,
or in hunting, or in exhibiting with applause some theatrical spectacle,
have borne great labors and pains, it is not enough that through popular
vanity he is checked by no reproofs, but he is moreover extolled with
praises: “Because,” as it is written, “the sinner is praised in the
desires of his soul.” <span id="fr_2631"></span>[2632](#fn_2631.md) For the
force of desires makes endurance of labors and pains: and no man save
for that which he enjoyeth, freely takes on him to bear that which
annoyeth. But these lusts, as I said, for the fulfilling of which they
which are on fire with them most patiently endure much hardship and
bitterness, are accounted to be permitted, and allowed by laws.
