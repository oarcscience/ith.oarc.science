<span id="iv.i.ix-p3"></span>The question is explained, which had been
deferred in the previous book, viz. that God the Father, who begat the
Son, His power and wisdom, is not only the Father of power and wisdom,
but also Himself power and wisdom; and similarly the Holy Spirit: yet
that there are not three powers or three wisdoms, but one power and one
wisdom, as there is one God and one essence. Inquiry is then made, why
the Latins say one essence, three persons, in God; but the Greeks, one
essence, three substances or hypostases: and both modes of expression
are shown to arise from the necessities of speech, that we might have an
answer to give when asked, what three, while truly confessing that there
are three, viz. the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
