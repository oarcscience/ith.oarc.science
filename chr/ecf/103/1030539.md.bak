<span id="v.ii.xxiii-p1"></span> 22. If, therefore, even they who are
united in marriage only for the purpose of begetting, for which purpose
marriage was instituted, are not compared with the Fathers, seeking
their very sons in a way far other than do these; forasmuch as Abraham,
being bidden to slay his son, fearless and devoted, spared not his only
son, whom from out of great despair he had received <span
id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996.md) save that he laid down his hand,
when He forbade him, at Whose command he had lifted it up; it remains
that we consider, whether at least continent persons among us are to be
compared to those Fathers who were married; unless haply now these are
to be preferred to them, to whom we have not yet found persons to
compare. For there was a greater good in their marriage, than is the
proper good of marriage: to which without doubt the good of Continence
is to be preferred: because they sought not sons from marriage by such
duty as these are led by, from a certain sense of mortal nature
requiring succession against decease. And, whoso denies this to be good
he knows not <span id="page_409">p. 409</span> <span
id="v.ii.xxiii-Page_409"></span>God, the Creator of all things good,
from things heavenly even unto things earthly, from things immortal even
unto things mortal. But neither are beasts altogether without this sense
of begetting, and chiefly birds, whose care of building nests meets us
at once, and a certain likeness to marriages, in order to beget and
nurture together. But those men, with mind far holier, surpassed this
affection of mortal nature, the chastity whereof in its own kind, there
being added thereto the worship of God, as some have understood, is set
forth as bearing first thirty-fold; who sought sons of their marriage
for the sake of Christ; in order to distinguish His race after the flesh
from all nations: even as God was pleased to order, that this above the
rest should avail to prophesy of Him, in that it was foretold of what
race also, and of what nation, He should hereafter come in the flesh.
Therefore it was a far greater good than the chaste marriages of
believers among us, which father Abraham knew in his own thigh, under
which he bade his servant to put his hand, that he might take an oath
concerning the wife, whom his son was to marry. For putting his hand
under the thigh of a man, and swearing by the God of Heaven, <span
id="fr_1997"></span>[1998](#fn_1997.md) what else did he signify, than that
in that Flesh, which derived its origin from that thigh, the God of
Heaven would come? Therefore marriage is a good, wherein married persons
are so much the better, in proportion as they fear God with greater
chastity and faithfulness, specially if the sons, whom they desire after
the flesh, they also bring up after the spirit.
