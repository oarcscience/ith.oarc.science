<span id="v.i.xxi-p1"></span> 21. That, therefore, the flesh lusteth
against the Spirit, that there dwelleth not in our flesh good, that the
law in our members is opposed to the law of the mind, is not a mingling
of two natures caused of contrary principles, but a division of one
against itself caused through desert of sin. We were not so in Adam,
before that nature, having listened to and followed its deceiver, had
despised and offended its Creator: that is, not the former life of man
created, but the latter punishment of man condemned. From which
condemnation when set free by Grace, through Jesus Christ, being free
they contend with their punishment, having received not as yet full
salvation, but already a pledge of salvation: but when not set free,
they are both guilty by reason of sins, and involved in punishments. But
after this life for the guilty <span id="page_388">p. 388</span> <span
id="v.i.xxi-Page_388"></span>there will remain for ever punishment for
their crime: for the free there will no more remain for ever either
crime or punishment: but the good substances, spirit and flesh, will
continue for ever, which God, Who is good, and incapable of change,
created good although capable of change. But they will continue having
been changed for the better, never from this time to be changed for the
worse: all evil being utterly destroyed, both what man hath unjustly
done, and what he hath justly suffered. And, these two kinds of evil
perishing utterly, whereof the one is of iniquity going before, the
other of unhappiness following after, the will of man will be upright
without any depravity. There it will be clear and plain to all, what now
many of the faithful believe, few understand, that evil is not a
substance: but that, as a wound in a body, so in a substance, which hath
made itself faulty, it hath begun to exist, when the disease hath
commenced, and ceaseth to exist in it, when the healing hath been
perfected. Therefore, all evil having arisen from us, and having been
destroyed in us, our good also having been increased and perfected unto
the height of most happy incorruption and immortality, of what kind
shall either of our substances be? forasmuch as now, in this corruption
and mortality, when as yet “the corruptible body weigheth down the
soul;” <span id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878) and, what the Apostle
saith, “the body is dead by reason of sin;” <span
id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879) yet the same himself beareth such
witness unto our flesh, that is, to our lowest and earthly part, as to
say, what I made mention of a little above, “No one ever hated his own
flesh.” <span id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880) And to add
straightway, “but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ the
Church.”
