<span id="v.i.xxiii-p1"></span> 23. The Apostle has made known to us
certain three unions, Christ and the Church, husband and wife, spirit
and flesh. Of these the former consult for the good of the latter, the
latter wait upon the former. All the things are good, when, in them,
certain set over by way of pre-eminence, certain made subject in a
becoming manner, observe the beauty of order. Husband and wife receive
command and pattern how they ought to be one with another. The command
is, “Let wives be subject unto their own husbands, as unto the Lord;
because the husband is the head of the wife;” <span
id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888.md) and, “Husbands, love your wives.”
But there is given a pattern, unto wives from the Church, unto husbands
from Christ: “As the Church,” saith he, “is subject unto Christ, so also
wives unto their own husbands in all things.” In like manner also,
having given command to husbands to love their own wives, he added a
pattern, “As Christ loved the Church.” But husbands he exhorted to it
from a lower matter also, that is, from their own body: not only from a
higher, that is, from their Lord. <span id="page_389">p. 389</span>
<span id="v.i.xxiii-Page_389"></span>For he not only saith, “Husbands,
love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church,” which is from an
higher: but he said also, “Husbands ought to love their own wives, as
their own bodies,” which is from a lower: because both higher and lower
are all good. And yet the woman received not pattern from the body, or
flesh, to be so subject to the husband as the flesh to the spirit; but
either the Apostle would have understood by consequence, what he omitted
to state: or haply because the flesh lusteth against the spirit in the
mortal and sick estate of this life, therefore he would not set the
woman a pattern of subjection from it. But the men he would for this
reason, because, although the spirit lusteth against the flesh, even in
this it consults for the good of the flesh: not like as the flesh
lusting against the spirit, by such opposition consulteth neither for
the good of the spirit, nor for its own. Yet the good spirit would not
consult for its good, whether by nourishing and cherishing its nature by
forethought, or by resisting its faults by continence, were it not that
each substance showeth God to be the Creator of each, even by the
seemliness of this its order. What is it, therefore, that with true
madness ye both boast yourselves to be Christians, and with so great,
perverseness contend against the Christian Scriptures, with eyes closed,
or rather put out, asserting both that Christ hath appeared unto mortals
in false flesh, and that the Church in the soul pertains to Christ, in
the body to the devil, and that the male and female sex are works of the
devil, not of God, and that the flesh is joined unto the spirit, as an
evil substance unto a good substance?
