<span id="v.i.x-p1"></span> 10. But in order that we fall not away from
Continence, we ought to watch specially against those snares of the
suggestions of the devil, that we presume not of our own strength. For,
“Cursed is every one that setteth his hope in man.” <span
id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837.md) And who is he, but man? We cannot
therefore truly say that he setteth not his hope in man, who setteth it
in himself. For this also, to “live after man,” what is it but to “live
after the flesh?” Whoso therefore is tempted by such a suggestion, let
him hear, and, if he have any Christian feeling, let him tremble. Let
him hear, I say, “If ye shall live after the flesh, ye shall die.”
