<span id="iv.vii.ii-p1"></span> 2. Of this, then, ye have now received,
have meditated, and having meditated have held, that ye should say, “I
believe in God the Father Almighty.” God is Almighty, and yet, though
Almighty, He cannot die, cannot be deceived, cannot lie; and, as the
Apostle says, “cannot deny Himself.” <span
id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764.md) How many things that He cannot do,
and yet is Almighty! yea therefore is Almighty, because He cannot do
these things. For if He could die, He were not Almighty; if to lie, if
to be deceived, if to do unjustly, were possible for Him, He were not
Almighty: because if this were in Him, He should not be worthy to be
Almighty. To our Almighty Father, it is quite impossible to sin. He does
whatsoever He will: that is Omnipotence. He does whatsoever He rightly
will, whatsoever He justly will: but whatsoever is evil to do, He wills
not. There is no resisting one who is Almighty, that He should not do
what He will. It was He Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that
in them is, invisible and visible. Invisible such as are in heaven,
thrones, dominions, principalities, powers, archangels, angels: all, if
we shall live aright, our fellow-citizens. He made in heaven the things
visible; the sun, the moon, the stars. With its terrestrial animals He
adorned the earth, filled the air with things that fly, the land with
them that walk and creep, the sea with them that swim: all He filled
with their own proper creatures. He made also man after His own image
and likeness, in the mind: for in that is the image of God. This is the
reason why the mind cannot be comprehended even by itself, because in it
is the image of God. To this end were we made, that over the other
creatures we should bear rule: but through sin in the first man we fell,
and are all come into an inheritance of death. We were brought low,
became mortal, were filled with fears, with errors: this by desert of
sin: with which desert and guilt is every man born. <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765.md) This is the reason why, as ye have
seen to-day, as ye know, even little children undergo exsufflation,
exorcism; to drive away from them the power of the devil their enemy,
which deceived man that it might possess mankind. It is not then the
creature of God that in infants undergoes exorcism or exsufflation: but
he under whom are all that are born with sin; for he is the first <span
id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766.md) of sinners. And for this cause by
reason of one <span id="page_370">p. 370</span> <span
id="iv.vii.ii-Page_370"></span>who fell and brought all into death,
there was sent One without sin, Who should bring unto life, by
delivering them from sin, all that believe on Him.
