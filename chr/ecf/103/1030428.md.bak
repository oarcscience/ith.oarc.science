<span id="iv.vi.ii-p1"></span> 1. IF, Honoratus, a heretic, and a man
trusting heretics seemed to me one and the same, I should judge it my
duty to remain silent both in tongue and pen in this matter. But now,
whereas there is a very great difference between these two: forasmuch as
he, in my opinion, is an heretic, who, for the sake of some temporal
advantage, and chiefly for the sake of his own glory and pre-eminence,
either gives birth to, or follows, false and new opinions; but he, who
trusts men of this kind, is a man deceived by a certain imagination of
truth and piety. This being the case, I have not thought it my duty to
be silent towards you, as to my opinions on the finding and retaining of
truth: with great love of which, as you know, we have burned from our
very earliest youth: but it is a thing far removed from the minds of
vain men, who, having too far advanced and fallen into these corporeal
things, think that there is nothing else than what they perceive by
those five well-known reporters of the body; and what impressions <span
id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692.md) and images they have received from
these, they carry over with themselves, even when they essay to withdraw
from the senses; and by the deadly and most deceitful rule of these
think that they measure most rightly the unspeakable recesses of truth.
Nothing is more easy, my dearest friend, than for one not only to say,
but also to think, that he hath found out the truth; but how difficult
it is in reality, you will perceive, I trust, from this letter of mine.
And that this may profit you, or at any rate may in no way harm you, and
also all, into whose hands it shall chance to come, <span
id="page_348">p. 348</span> <span id="iv.vi.ii-Page_348"></span>I have
both prayed, and do pray, unto God; and I hope that it will be so,
forasmuch as <span id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693.md) I am fully
conscious that I have undertaken to write it, in a pious and friendly
spirit, not as aiming at vain reputation, or trifling display.
