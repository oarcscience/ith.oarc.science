<span id="v.vii.xxiii-p1"></span> 22. There also is said at what work
the Apostle wrought. “After these things,” it says, “he departed from
Athens and came to Corinth; and having found a certain Jew, by name
Aquila, of Pontus by birth, lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his
wife, because that Claudius had ordered all Jews to depart from Rome, he
came unto them, and because he was of the same craft he abode with them,
doing work: for they were tent-makers.” <span
id="fr_2548"></span>[2549](#fn_2548.md) This if they shall essay to
interpret allegorically, they show what proficients they be in
ecclesiastical learning, on which they glory that they bestow all their
time. And, at the least, touching those sayings above recited, “Or I
only and Barnabas, have we not power to forbear working?” and, “We have
not used this power;” <span id="fr_2549"></span>[2550](#fn_2549.md) and,
“When we might be burdensome to you, as Apostles of Christ,” <span
id="fr_2550"></span>[2551](#fn_2550.md) and, “Night and day working that we
might not burden any of you;” <span id="fr_2551"></span>[2552](#fn_2551.md)
and, “The Lord hath ordained for them which preach the Gospel, of the
Gospel to live; but I have used none of these things:” <span
id="fr_2552"></span>[2553](#fn_2552.md) and the rest of this kind, let them
either expound otherwise, or if by most clear shining light of truth
they be put to it, let them understand and obey; or if to obey they be
either unwilling or unable, at least let them own them which be willing,
to be better, and them which be also able, to be happier men than they.
For it is one thing to plead infirmity of body, either truly alleged, or
falsely pretended: but another so to be deceived and so to deceive, that
it shall even be thought a proof of righteousness obtaining more
mightily in servants of God, if laziness have gotten power to reign
among a set of ignorant men. He, namely, who shows a true infirmity of
body, must be humanely dealt withal; he who pretends a false one, and
cannot be convicted, must be left unto God: yet neither of them fixeth a
pernicious rule; because a good servant of God both serves his
manifestly infirm brother; and, when the other deceives, if he believes
him because he does not think him a bad man, he does not imitate him
that he may be bad; and if he believe him not; he thinks him deceitful,
and does, nevertheless, not imitate him. But when a man says, “This is
true righteousness, that by doing no bodily work we imitate the birds of
the air, because he who shall do any such work, goes against the
Gospel:” whoso being infirm in mind hears and believes this, that
person, not for that he so bestows all his time, but for that he so
erreth, must be mourned over.
