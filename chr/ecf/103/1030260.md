All Things Good.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p2"></span>By the Trinity, thus supremely and
equally and unchangeably good, all things were created; and these are
not supremely and equally and unchangeably good, but yet they are good,
even taken separately. Taken as a whole, however, they are very good,
because their *ensemble* constitutes the universe in all its wonderful
order and beauty.
