<span id="v.v.xii-p1"></span> 11. But if any man supposes that the
reason why it is right for a person to tell a lie for another is, that
he may live the while, or not be offended in those things which he much
loveth, to the end he may attain unto eternal truth by being taught:
that man doth not understand, in the first place, that there is no
flagitious thing which he may not upon the same ground be compelled to
commit, as has been above demonstrated; and in the next place, that the
authority of the doctrine itself is cut off and altogether undone if
those whom we essay to bring thereunto, are by our lie made to think
that it is somewhiles right to lie. For seeing the doctrine which
bringeth salvation consisteth partly in things to be believed, partly in
things to be understood; and there is no attaining unto those things
which are to be understood, unless first those things are believed,
which are to be believed; how can there be any believing one who thinks
it is sometimes right to lie, lest haply he lie at the moment when he
teacheth us to believe? For how can it be known whether he have at that
moment some cause, as he thinks, for a well-meant <span
id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328.md) lie, deeming that by a false story
a man may be frightened and kept from lust, and in this way account that
by telling a lie he is doing good even in spiritual things? Which kind
of lie once admitted and approved, all discipline of faith is subverted
altogether; and this being subverted, neither is there any attaining to
understanding, for the receiving of which that discipline nurtur<span

babes: and so all the doctrine of truth is done away, giving place to
most licentious falsehood, if a lie, even well-meant, may from any
quarter have place opened for it to enter in. For either whoso tells a
lie prefers temporal advantages, his own or another’s, to truth; than
which what can be more perverse? or when by aid of a lie he wishes to
make a person fit for gaining the truth, he bars the approach to truth,
for by wishing when he lies to be accommodating, <span
id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329.md) it comes to pass that when he
speaks the truth, he cannot be depended upon. Wherefore, either we must
not believe good men, or we must believe those whom we think obliged
sometimes to tell a lie, or we must not believe that good men sometimes
tell lies: of these three the first is pernicious, the second foolish;
it remains therefore that good men should never tell lies.
