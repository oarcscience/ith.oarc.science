id="iv.ii.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42.—The Sacrament of Baptism
Indicates Our Death with Christ to Sin, and Our Resurrection with Him to
Newness of Life.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xliv-p2"></span>And this is the meaning of the great
sacrament of baptism which is solemnized among us, that all who attain
to this grace should die to sin, as He is said to have died to sin,
because He died in the flesh, which is the likeness of sin; and rising
from the font regenerate, as He arose alive from the grave, should begin
a new life in the Spirit, whatever may be the age of the body?
