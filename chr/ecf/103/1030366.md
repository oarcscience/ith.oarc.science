id="iv.ii.cxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 116.—Luke Expresses the Substance
of These Seven Petitions More Briefly in Five.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cxviii-p2"></span>But the Evangelist Luke in his version
of the Lord’s prayer embraces not seven, but five petitions: not, of
course, that there is any discrepancy between the two evangelists, but
that Luke indicates by his very brevity the mode in which the seven
petitions of Matthew are to be understood. For God’s name is hallowed in
the spirit; and God’s kingdom shall come in the resurrection of the
body. Luke, therefore, intending to show that the third petition is a
sort of repetition of the first two, has chosen to indicate that by
omitting the third altogether. <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312) Then he adds three others: one for
daily bread, another for pardon of sin, another for immunity from
temptation. And what Matthew puts as the last petition, “but deliver us
from evil,” Luke has omitted, <span id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313)
to show us that it is embraced in the previous petition about
temptation. Matthew, indeed, himself says, “*but* deliver,” not “*and*
deliver,” as if to show that the petitions are virtually one: do not
this, but this; so that every man is to understand that he is delivered
from evil in the very fact of his not being led into temptation.
