<span id="iv.i.xvi.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—The Trinity in the Mind is the
Image of God, in that It Remembers, Understands, and Loves God, Which to
Do is Wisdom.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xii-p2"></span>15. This trinity, then, of the mind is
not therefore the image of God, because the mind remembers itself, and
understands and loves itself; but because it can also remember,
understand, and love Him by whom it was made. And in so doing it is made
wise itself. But if it does not do so, even when it remembers,
understands, and loves itself, then it is foolish. Let it then remember
its God, after whose image it is made, and let it understand and love
Him. Or to say the same thing more briefly, let it worship God, who is
not made, by whom because itself was made, it is capable and can be
partaker of Him; wherefore it is written, “Behold, the worship of God,
that is wisdom.” <span id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881) And then it
will be wise, not by its own light, but by participation of that supreme
Light; and wherein it is eternal, therein shall reign in blessedness.
For this wisdom of man is so called, in that it is also of God. For then
it is true wisdom; for if it is human, it is vain. Yet not so of God, as
is that wherewith God is wise. For He is not wise by partaking of
Himself, as the mind is by partaking of God. But as we call it the
righteousness of God, not only when we speak of that by which He Himself
is righteous, but also of that which He gives to man when He justifies
the ungodly, which latter righteousness the apostle commending, says of
some, that “not knowing the righteousness of God and going about to
establish their own righteousness,they are not subject to the
righteousness of God;” <span id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882) so also
it may be said of some, that not knowing the wisdom of God <span
id="page_192">p. 192</span> <span id="iv.i.xvi.xii-Page_192"></span>and
going about to establish their own wisdom, they are not subject to the
wisdom of God.

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xii-p5"></span>16. There is, then, a nature not made,
which made all other natures, great and small, and is without doubt more
excellent than those which it has made, and therefore also than that of
which we are speaking; *viz.* than the rational and intellectual nature,
which is the mind of man, made after the image of Him who made it. And
that nature, more excellent than the rest, is God. And indeed “He is not
far from every one of us,” as the apostle says, who adds, “For in Him we
live, and are moved, and have our being.” <span
id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883) And if this were said in respect to
the body, it might be understood even of this corporeal world; for in it
too in respect to the body, we live, and are moved, and have our being.
And therefore it ought to be taken in a more excellent way, and one that
is spiritual, not visible, in respect to the mind, which is made after
His image. For what is there that is not in Him, of whom it is divinely
written, “For of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all
things”? <span id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884) If, then, all things
are in Him, in whom can any possibly live that do live, or be moved that
are moved, except in Him in whom they are? Yet all are not with Him in
that way in which it is said to Him, “I am continually with Thee.” <span
id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885) Nor is He with all in that way in
which we say, The Lord be with you. And so it is the especial
wretchedness of man not to be with Him, without whom he cannot be. For,
beyond a doubt, he is not without Him in whom he is; and yet if he does
not remember, and understand, and love Him, he is not with Him. And when
any one absolutely forgets a thing, certainly it is impossible even to
remind him of it.
