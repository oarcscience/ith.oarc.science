<span id="iv.i.vii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.vii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—The Accidental Always Implies
Some Change in the Thing.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vii.iv-p2"></span>5. That which is accidental commonly
implies that it can be lost by some change of the thing to which it is
an accident. For although some accidents are said to be inseparable,
which in Greek are called <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.vii.iv-p2.1"></span>ἀχώριστα</span>, as the color black is to
the feather of a raven; <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> <span
id="iv.i.vii.iv-Page_89"></span>yet the feather loses that color, not
indeed so long as it is a feather, but because the feather is not
always. Wherefore the matter itself is changeable; and whenever that
animal or that feather ceases to be, and the whole of that body is
changed and turned into earth, it loses certainly that color also.
Although the kind of accident which is called separable may likewise be
lost, not by separation, but by change; as, for instance, blackness is
called a separable accident to the hair of men, because hair continuing
to be hair can grow white; yet, if carefully considered, it is
sufficiently apparent, that it is not as if anything departed by
separation away from the head when it grows white, as though blackness
departed thence and went somewhere and whiteness came in its place, but
that the quality of color there is turned and changed. Therefore there
is nothing accidental in God, because there is nothing changeable or
that may be lost. But if you choose to call that also accidental, which,
although it may not be lost, yet can be decreased or increased,—as, for
instance, the life of the soul: for as long as it is a soul, so long it
lives, and because the soul is always, it always lives; but because it
lives more when it is wise, and less when it is foolish, here, too, some
change comes to pass, not such that life is absent, as wisdom is absent
to the foolish, but such that it is less;—nothing of this kind, either,
happens to God, because He remains altogether unchangeable.
