<span id="v.viii.i-p1"></span> Erasmus infers from the style and
language of this piece, that it is not S. Augustin’s, putting it in the
same category with the treatises *On Continence, On substance of
Charity, On Faith of things invisible.* The Benedictine editors
acknowledge that it has peculiarities of style which are calculated to
move suspicion; (especially the studied assonances and rhyming endings,
e.g. “*cautior fuit iste in doloribus quam ille in nemoribus . . .
consensit ille oblectamentis, non cessit ille tormentis*,” chap. 12.);
yet they feel themselves bound to retain it among the genuine works by
Augustin’s own testimony, who mentions both this piece and that *On
Continence* in his Epistle to Darius, 231. chap. 7. \[Vol. I. 584.\]
That it is not named in the *Retractations* is accounted for by the
circumstance that it appears to have been delivered as a sermon, see
chap. 1. and 3, and Augustin did not live to fulfill his intention of
composing a further book of retractations on review of his popular
discourses and letters. *Ep*. 224. chap. 2. In point of matter and
doctrine this treatise has nothing contrary to or not in harmony with S.
Augustin’s known doctrine and sentiments.
