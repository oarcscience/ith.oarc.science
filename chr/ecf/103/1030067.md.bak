<span id="iv.i.vi.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—The Devil the Mediator of
Death, Christ of Life.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vi.xiii-p2"></span>15. In no wise therefore are souls
cleansed and reconciled to God by sacrilegious imitations, or curious
arts that are impious, or magical incantations; since the false mediator
does not translate them to higher things, but rather blocks and cuts off
the way thither through the affections, malignant in proportion as they
are proud, which he inspires into those of his own company; which are
not able to nourish the wings of virtues so as to fly upwards, but
rather to heap up the weight of vices so as to press downwards; since
the soul will fall down the more heavily, the more it seems to itself to
have been carried upwards. Accordingly, as the Magi did when warned of
God, <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) whom the star led to adore
the low estate of the Lord; so we also ought to return to our country,
not by the way by which we came, but by another way which the lowly King
has taught, and which the proud king, the adversary of that lowly King,
cannot block up. For to us, too, that we may adore the lowly Christ, the
“heavens have declared the glory of God, when their sound went into all
the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.” <span
id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) A way was made for us to death through
sin in Adam. For, “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by
sin; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.” <span
id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) Of this way the devil was the
mediator, the persuader to sin, and the caster down into death. For he,
too, applied his one death to work out our double death. Since he indeed
died in the spirit through ungodliness, but certainly did not die in the
flesh: yet both persuaded us to ungodliness, and thereby brought it to
pass that we deserved to come into the death of the flesh. We desired
therefore the one through wicked persuasion, the other followed us by a
just condemnation; and therefore it is written, “God made not
death,” <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) since He was not Himself
the cause of death; but yet death was inflicted on the sinner, through
His most just retribution. Just as the judge inflicts punishment on the
guilty; yet it is not the justice of the judge, but the desert of the
crime, which is the cause of the punishment. Whither, then, the mediator
of death caused us to pass, yet did not come himself, that is, to the
death of the flesh, there our Lord God introduced for us the medicine of
correction, which He deserved not, by a hidden and exceeding mysterious
decree of divine and profound justice. In order, therefore, that as by
one man came death, so by one man might come also the resurrection of
the dead; <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) because men strove
more to shun that which they could not shun, *viz.* the death of the
flesh, than the death of the spirit, *i.e.* punishment more than the
desert of punishment (for not to sin is a thing about which either men
are not solicitous or are too little solicitous; but not to die,
although it be not within reach of attainment, is yet eagerly sought
after); the Mediator of life, making it plain that death is not to be
feared, which by the condition of humanity cannot now be escaped, but
rather ungodliness, which can be guarded against through faith, meets us
at the end to which we have come, but not by the way by which we came.
For we, indeed, came to death through sin; He through righteousness:
and, therefore, as our death is the punishment of sin, so His death was
made a sacrifice for sin.
