<span id="iv.v.iii-p1"></span> 3. But you say, that you therefore
believe your friend, whose heart you cannot see, because you have proved
him in your trials, and have come to know of what manner of spirit he
was towards you in your dangers, wherein he deserted you not. Seemeth it
therefore to you that we must wish for our own affliction, that our
friend’s love towards us may be proved? And shall no man be happy in
most sure friends, unless he shall be unhappy through adversity? so
that, forsooth, he enjoy not the tried love of the other, unless he be
racked by pain and fear of his own? And how in the having of true
friends can that happiness be wished for, and not rather feared, which
nothing save unhappiness can put to the proof? And yet it is true that a
friend may be had also in prosperity, but proved more surely in
adversity. But assuredly in order to prove him, neither would you commit
yourself to dangers of your own, unless you believed; and thus, when you
commit yourself in order to prove, you believe before you prove. For
surely, if we ought not to believe things not seen, <span
id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654.md) since indeed we believe the hearts
of our friends, and that, not yet surely proved; and, after we shall
have proved them good by our own ills, even then we believe rather than
see their good will towards us: except that so great is faith, that, not
unsuitably, we judge that we see, with certain eyes of it, that which we
believe, whereas we ought therefore to believe, because we cannot see.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p2"></span> The text seems corrupt. A <span
class="c19"><span id="iv.v.iii-p2.1"></span>ms</span>. in Brasenose
Library reads, “*si non vis rebus credere*.” If we read “*Si non vis
rebus non visis credere*,” the sense will be, “For certainly if you will
not have us believe things unseen, we ought not (to believe this),
since” etc.
