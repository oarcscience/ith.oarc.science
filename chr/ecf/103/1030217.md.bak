<span id="iv.i.xvi.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Whether the Sentence of John
is to Be Understood of Our Future Likeness with the Son of God in the
Immortality Itself Also of the Body.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xviii-p2"></span>24. But the Apostle John says,
“Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we
shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him,
for we shall see Him as He is.” <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md)
Hence it appears, that the full likeness of God is to take place in that
image of God at that time when it shall receive the full sight of God.
And yet this may also possibly seem to be said by the Apostle John of
the immortality of the body. For we shall be like to God in this too,
but only to the Son, because He only in the Trinity took a body, in
which He died and rose again, and which He carried with Him to heaven
above. For this, too, is called an image of the Son of God, in which we
shall have, as He has, an immortal body, being conformed in this respect
not to the image of the Father or of the Holy Spirit, but only of the
Son, because of Him alone is it read and received by a sound faith, that
“the Word was made flesh.” <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md) And
for this reason the apostle says, “Whom He did foreknow, He also did
predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be
the first-born among many brethren.” <span
id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md) “The first-born” certainly “from the
dead,” <span id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925.md) accord<span
id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span
id="iv.i.xvi.xviii-Page_197"></span>ing to the same apostle; by which
death His flesh was sown in dishonor, and rose again in glory. According
to this image of the Son, to which we are conformed in the body by
immortality, we also do that of which the same apostle speaks, “As we
have borne the image of the earthy, so shall we also bear the image of
the heavenly;” <span id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926.md) to wit, that we
who are mortal after Adam, may hold by a true faith, and a sure and
certain hope, that we shall be immortal after Christ. For so can we now
bear the same image, not yet in sight, but in faith; not yet in fact,
but in hope. For the apostle, when he said this, was speaking of the
resurrection of the body.
