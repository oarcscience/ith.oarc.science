id="iv.i.xi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—In What Desire and Love
Differ.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xi.viii-p2"></span>\[Conceived\] therefore, either by
desire or by love: not that the creature ought not to be loved; but if
that love \[of the creature\] is referred to the Creator, then it will
not be desire (*cupiditas*), but love (*charitas*). For it is desire
when the creature is loved for itself. And then it does not help a man
through making use of it, but corrupts him in the enjoying it. When,
therefore, the creature is either equal to us or inferior, we must use
the inferior in order to God, but we must enjoy the equal duly in God.
For as thou oughtest to enjoy thyself, not in thyself, but in Him who
made thee, so also him whom thou lovest as thyself. Let us enjoy,
therefore, both ourselves and our brethren in the Lord; and hence let us
not dare to yield, and as it were to relax, ourselves to ourselves in
the direction downwards. Now a word is born, when, being thought out, it
pleases us either to the effect of sinning, or to that of doing right.
Therefore love, as it were a mean, conjoins our word and the mind from
which it is conceived, and without any confusion binds itself as a third
with them, in an incorporeal embrace.
