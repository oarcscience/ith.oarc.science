<span id="iv.i.vi.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—The Number Six is Also Commended
in the Building Up of the Body of Christ and of the Temple at
Jerusalem.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vi.vi-p2"></span>9. And not without reason is the number
six understood to be put for a year in the building up of the body of
the Lord, as a figure of which He said that He would raise up in three
days the temple destroyed by the Jews. For they said, “Forty and six
years was this temple in building.” <span
id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482) And six times forty-six makes two
hundred and seventy-six. And this number of days completes nine months
and six days, which are reckoned, as it were, ten months for the travail
of women; not because all come to the sixth day after the ninth month,
but because the perfection itself of the body of the Lord is found to
have been brought in so many days to the birth, as the authority of the
church maintains upon the tradition of the elders. For He is believed to
have been conceived on the 25th of March, upon which day also He
suffered; so the womb of the Virgin, in which He was conceived, where no
one of mortals was begotten, corresponds to the new grave in which He
was buried, wherein was never man laid, <span
id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483) neither before nor since. But He was
born, according to tradition, upon December the 25th. If, then you
reckon from that day to this you find two hundred and seventy-six days
which is forty-six times six. And in this number of years the temple was
built, because in that number of sixes the body of the Lord was
perfected; which being destroyed by the suffering of death, He raised
again on the third day. For “He spake this of the temple of His
body,” <span id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484) as is declared by the
most clear and solid testimony of the Gospel; where He said, “For as
Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly, so shall the
Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
earth.” <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485)
