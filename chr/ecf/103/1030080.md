<span id="iv.i.vii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—The Argument of the Arians is
Refuted, Which is Drawn from the Words Begotten and Unbegotten.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vii.iii-p2"></span>4. Wherefore,—to being now to answer
the adversaries of our faith, respecting those things also, which are
neither said as they are thought, nor thought as they really are:—among
the many things which the Arians are wont to dispute against the
Catholic faith, they seem chiefly to set forth this, as their most
crafty device, namely, that whatsoever is said or understood of God, is
said not according to accident, but according to substance, and
therefore, to be unbegotten belongs to the Father according to
substance, and to be begotten belongs to the Son according to substance;
but to be unbegotten and to be begotten are different; therefore the
substance of the Father and that of the Son are different. To whom we
reply, If whatever is spoken of God is spoken according to substance,
then that which is said, “I and the Father are one,” <span
id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567) is spoken according to substance.
Therefore there is one substance of the Father and the Son. Or if this
is not said according to substance, then something is said of God not
according to substance, and therefore we are no longer compelled to
understand unbegotten and begotten according to substance. It is also
said of the Son, “He thought it not robbery to be equal with God.” <span
id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568) We ask, equal according to what? For
if He is not said to be equal according to substance, then they admit
that something may be said of God not according to substance. Let them
admit, then, that unbegotten and begotten are not spoken according to
substance. And if they do not admit this, on the ground that they will
have all things to be spoken of God according to substance, then the Son
is equal to the Father according to substance.
