<span id="v.vi.iv-p1"></span> 3. Which sentence dishonoreth the holy
Martyrs, nay rather taketh away holy martyrdoms altogether. For they
would do more justly and wisely, according to these men, not to confess
to their persecutors that they were Christians, and by confessing make
them murderers: but rather by telling a lie, and denying what they were,
should both themselves keep safe the convenience of the flesh and
purpose of the heart, and not allow those to accomplish the wickedness
which they had conceived in their mind. For they were not their
neighbors in the Christian faith, that with them it should be their duty
to speak the truth in their mouth which they spake in their heart; but
moreover enemies of Truth itself. For if Jehu (whom it seems they do
prudently to single out unto themselves to look unto as an example of
lying) falsely gave himself out for a servant of Baal, that he might
slay Baal’s servants: how much more justly, according to their
perversity, might, in time of persecution, the servants of Christ
falsely give themselves out, for servants of demons, that the servants
of demons might not slay servants of Christ; and sacrifice to idols that
men might not be killed, if Jehu sacrificed to Baal that he might kill
men? For what harm would it do them, according to the egregious doctrine
of these speakers of lies, if they should lyingly pretend a worship of
the Devil in the body, when the worship of God was preserved in the
heart? But not so have the Martyrs understood the Apostle, the true, the
holy Martyrs. They saw and held that which is written, “With the heart
man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made
unto salvation;” <span id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388) and, “In
their mouth was found no lie:” <span
id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389) and so they departed
irreproachable, to that place where to be tempted by liars any further
they will not fear; because they will not have liars any more in their
heavenly assemblies, either for strangers or neighbors. As for that
Jehu, by an impious lie and a sacrilegious sacrifice making inquisition
for impious and sacrilegious men for to kill them, they would not
imitate him, no, not though the Scripture had said nothing concerning
him, what manner of man he was. But, seeing it is written that he had
not his heart right with God; <span id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390)
what profited it him, that for some obedience which, concerning the
utter destruction of the house of Ahab, he exhibited for the lust of his
own domination. he received some amount of transitory wages in a
temporal kingdom? Let, rather, the truth-telling sentence of the Martyrs
be thine to defend: to this I exhort thee, my brother, that thou mayst
be against liars, not a teacher of lying, but an asserter of truth. For,
I pray thee, attend diligently to what I say, that thou mayest find how
needful to be shunned is that which, with laudable zeal indeed towards
impious men, that they may be caught and corrected, or avoided, but yet
too incautiously, is thought fit to be taught.
