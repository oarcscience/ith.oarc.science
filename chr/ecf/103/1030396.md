<span id="iv.iii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—Of the Six Ages of the
World.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxiii-p2"></span>39. “Five ages of the world,
accordingly, having been now completed (there has entered the sixth). Of
these ages the first is from the beginning of the human race, that is,
from Adam, who was the first man that was made, down to Noah, who
constructed the ark at the time of the flood. <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463) Then the second extends from that
period on to Abraham, who was called <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464) the father indeed of all
nations <span id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465) which should follow
the example of his faith, but who at the same time in the way of natural
descent from his own flesh was the father of the destined people of the
Jews; which people, previous to the entrance of the Gentiles into the
Christian faith, was the one people among all the nations of all lands
that worshipped the one true God: from which people also Christ the
Saviour was decreed to come according to the flesh. For these
turning-points <span id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466) of those two
ages occupy an eminent place in the ancient books. On the other hand,
those of the other three ages are also declared in the Gospel, <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467) where the descent of the Lord Jesus
Christ according to the flesh is likewise mentioned. For the third age
extends from Abraham on to David the king; the fourth from David on to
that captivity whereby the people of God passed over into Babylonia; and
the fifth from that transmigration down to the advent of our Lord Jesus
Christ. With His coming the sixth age has entered on its process; so
that now the spiritual grace, which in previous times was known to a few
patriarchs and prophets, may be made manifest to all nations; to the
intent that no man should worship God but freely, <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468) fondly desiring of Him not the
visible rewards of His services and the happiness of this present life,
but that eternal life alone in which he is to enjoy God Himself: in
order that in this sixth age the mind of man may be renewed after the
image of God, even as on the sixth day man was made after the image of
God. <span id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469) For then, too, is the
law fulfilled, when all that it has commanded is done, not in the strong
desire for things temporal, but in the love of Him who has given the
commandment. Who is there, moreover, who should not be earnestly
disposed to give the return of love to a God of supreme righteousness
and also of supreme mercy, who has first loved men of the greatest
unrighteousness and the loftiest pride, and that, too, so deeply as to
have sent in their behalf His only Son, by whom He made all things, and
who being made man, not by any change of Himself, but by the assumption
of human nature, was designed thus to become capable not only of living
with them, but also of dying at once for them and by their hands?

<span id="iv.iii.xxiii-p10"></span>40. “Thus, then, showing forth the
New Testament of our everlasting inheritance, wherein man was to be
renewed by the grace of God and lead a new life, that is, a spiritual
life; and with the view of exhibiting the first one as an old
dispensation, wherein a carnal people acting out the old man (with the
exception of a few patriarchs and prophets, who had understanding, and
some hidden saints), and leading a carnal life, desiderated carnal
rewards at the hands of the Lord God, and received in that fashion but
the figures of spiritual blessings;—with this intent, I say, the Lord
Christ, when made man, despised all earthly good things, in order that
He might show us how these things ought to be despised; and He endured
all earthly ills which He was inculcating as things needful to be
endured; so that neither might our happiness be sought for in the former
class, nor our unhappiness be apprehended in the latter. For being born
of a mother who, although she conceived without being touched by man and
always remained thus untouched, in virginity conceiving, in virginity
bringing forth, in virginity dying, had nevertheless been espoused to a
handicraftsman, He extinguished all the inflated pride of carnal
nobility. Moreover, being born in the city of Bethlehem, which among all
the cities of Judæa was so insignificant that even in our own day it is
designated a village, He willed not that any one should glory in the
exalted position of any city of earth. He, too, whose are all things and
by whom all things were created, was made poor, in order that no one,
while believing in Him, might venture to boast himself in earthly
riches. He refused to be made by men a king, because He displayed the
pathway of humility to those unhappy ones whom pride had separated from
Him; <span id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470) and yet universal
creation attests the fact of His everlasting kingdom. An hungered was He
who feeds all men; athirst was He by whom is created whatsoever is
drunk, and <span id="page_308">p. 308</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xxiii-Page_308"></span>who in a spiritual manner is the bread
of the hungry and the fountain of the thirsty; in journeying on earth,
wearied was He who has made Himself the way for us into heaven; as like
one dumb and deaf in the presence of His revilers was He by whom the
dumb spoke and the deaf heard; bound was He who freed us from the bonds
of infirmities; scourged was He who expelled from the bodies of man the
scourges of all distresses; crucified was He who put an end to our
crucial pains; <span id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471) dead did He
become who raised the dead. But He also rose again, no more to die, so
that no one should from Him learn so to contemn death as if he were
never to live again.
