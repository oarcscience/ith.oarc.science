<span id="v.iii.xxiv-p1"></span> 23. Lastly, let us hear the Lord
Himself delivering most plain judgment on this matter. For, upon His
speaking after a divine and fearful manner concerning husband and wife
not separating, save on account of fornication, His disciples said to
Him, “If the case be such with a wife, it is not good to marry.” <span
id="fr_2065"></span>[2066](#fn_2065) To whom He saith, “Not all receive
this saying. For there are eunuchs who were so born: but there are
others who were made by men: and there are eunuchs, who made themselves
eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven: whoso can receive, let
him receive.” What could be said more true, what more clear? Christ
saith, the Truth saith, the Power and Wisdom of God saith, that they,
who of pious purpose have contained from marrying a wife, make
themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven: and against
this, human vanity with impious rashness contends, that they, who do so,
shun only the present necessity of the troubles of married life, but in
the kingdom of heaven have no more than others.
