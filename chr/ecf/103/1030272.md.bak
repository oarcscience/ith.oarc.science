<span id="iv.ii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—A Lie is Not Allowable, Even to
Save Another from Injury.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxiv-p2"></span>But every lie must be called a sin,
because not only when a man knows the truth, but even when, as a man may
be, he is mistaken and deceived, it is his duty to say what he thinks in
his heart, whether it be true, or whether he only think it to be true.
But every liar says the opposite of what he thinks in his heart, with
purpose to deceive. Now it is evident that speech was given to man, not
that men might therewith deceive one another, but that one man might
make known his thoughts to another. To use speech, then, for the purpose
of deception, and not for its appointed end, is a sin. Nor are we to
suppose that there is any lie that is not a sin, because it is sometimes
possible, by telling a lie, to do service to another. For it is possible
to do this by theft also, as when we steal from a rich man who never
feels the loss, to give to a poor man who is sensibly benefited by what
he gets. And the same can be said of adultery also, when, for instance,
some woman appears likely to die of love unless we consent to her
wishes, while if she lived she might purify herself by repentance; but
yet no one will assert that on this account such an adultery is not a
sin. And if we justly place so high a value upon chastity, what offense
have we taken at truth, that, while no prospect of advantage to another
will lead us to violate the former by adultery, we should be ready to
violate the latter by lying? It cannot be denied that they have attained
a very high standard of goodness who never lie except to save a man from
injury; but in the case of men who have reached this standard, it is not
the deceit, but their good intention, that is justly praised, and
sometimes even rewarded. It is quite enough that the deception should be
pardoned, without its being made an object of laudation, especially
among the heirs of the new covenant, to whom it is said: “Let your
communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these
cometh of evil.” <span id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md) And it is on
account of this evil, which never ceases to creep in while we retain
this mortal vesture, that the co-heirs of Christ themselves say,
“Forgive us our debts.” <span id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md)
