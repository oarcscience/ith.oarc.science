<span id="iv.ii.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38.—Jesus Christ, According to the
Flesh, Was Not Born of the Holy Spirit in Such a Sense that the Holy
Spirit is His Father.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xl-p2"></span>Nevertheless, are we on this account to
say that the Holy Ghost is the father of the man Christ, and that as God
the Father begat the Word, so God the Holy Spirit begat the man, and
that these two natures constitute the one Christ; and that as the Word
He is the Son of God the Father, and as man the Son of God the Holy
Spirit, because the Holy Spirit as His father begat Him of the Virgin
Mary? Who will dare to say so? Nor is it necessary to show by reasoning
how many other absurdities flow from this supposition, when it is itself
so absurd that no believer’s ears can bear to hear it. Hence, as we
confess, “Our Lord Jesus Christ, who of God is God, and as man was born
of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, having both natures, the
divine and the human, is the only Son of God the Father Almighty, from
whom proceedeth the Holy Spirit.” <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155.md) Now in what sense do we say that
Christ was born of the Holy Spirit, if the Holy Spirit did not beget
Him? Is it that He made Him, since our Lord Jesus Christ, though as God
“all things were made by Him,” <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156.md) yet as man was Himself made; as the
apostle says, “who was made of the seed of David according to the
flesh?” <span id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157.md) But as that created
thing which the Virgin conceived and brought forth though it was united
only to the person of the Son, was made by the whole Trinity (for the
works of the Trinity are not separable), why should the Holy Spirit
alone be mentioned as having made it? Or is it that, when one of the
Three is mentioned as the author of any work, the whole Trinity is to be
understood as working? That is true, and can be proved by examples. But
we need not dwell longer on this <span id="page_251">p. 251</span> <span
id="iv.ii.xl-Page_251"></span>solution. For the puzzle is, in what sense
it is said, “born of the Holy Ghost,” when He is in no sense the Son of
the Holy Ghost? For though God made this world, it would not be right to
say that it is the Son of God, or that it was born of God; we would say
that it was created, or made, or framed, or ordered by Him, or whatever
form of expression we can properly use. Here, then, when we make
confession that Christ was born of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin
Mary, it is difficult to explain how it is that He is not the Son of the
Holy Ghost and is the Son of the Virgin Mary, when He was born both of
Him and of her. It is clear beyond a doubt that He was not born of the
Holy Spirit as His father, in the same sense that He was born of the
Virgin as His mother.
