<span id="iv.vii.v-p1"></span> 5. The Father doeth what He will, and
what He will doeth the Son. Do not imagine an Almighty Father and a not
Almighty Son: it is error, blot it out within you, let it not cleave in
your memory, let it not be drunk into your faith, and if haply any of
you shall have drunk it in, let him vomit it up. Almighty is the Father,
Almighty the Son. If Almighty begat not Almighty, He begat not very Son.
For what say we, brethren, if the Father being greater begat a Son less
than He? What said I, begat? Man engenders, being greater, a son being
less: it is true: but that is because the one grows old, the other grows
up, and by very growing attains to the form of his father. The Son of
God, if He groweth not because neither can God wax old, was begotten
perfect. And being begotten perfect, if He groweth not, and remained not
less, He is equal. For that ye may know Almighty begotten of Almighty,
hear Him Who is Truth. That which of Itself Truth saith, is true. What
saith Truth? What saith the Son, Who is Truth? “Whatsoever things the
Father doeth, these also the Son likewise doeth.” <span
id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770.md) The Son is Almighty, in doing all
things that He willeth to do. For if the Father doeth some things which
the Son doeth not, the Son said falsely, “Whatsoever things the Father
doeth, these also the Son doeth likewise.” But because the Son spake
<span id="page_371">p. 371</span> <span
id="iv.vii.v-Page_371"></span>truly, believe it: “Whatsoever things the
Father doeth, these also the Son doeth likewise,” and ye have believed
in the Son that He is Almighty. Which word although ye said not in the
Creed, yet this is it that ye expressed when ye believed in the Only
Son, Himself God. Hath the Father aught that the Son hath not? This
Arian heretic blasphemers say, not I. But what say I? If the Father hath
aught that the Son hath not, the Son lieth in saying, “All things that
the Father hath, are Mine.” <span id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771.md)
Many and innumerable are the testimonies by which it is proved that the
Son is Very Son of God the Father, and the Father God hath His
Very-begotten Son God, and Father and Son is One God.
