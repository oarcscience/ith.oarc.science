<span id="iv.i.xvii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—The Conclusion of the Book
with a Prayer, and an Apology for Multitude of Words.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xxviii-p2"></span>51. O Lord our God, we believe in
Thee, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. For the Truth would
not say, Go, baptize all nations in the name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit, unless Thou wast a Trinity. Nor wouldest
thou, O Lord God, bid us to be baptized in the name of Him who is not
the Lord God. Nor would the divine voice have said, Hear, O Israel, the
Lord thy God is one God, unless Thou wert so a Trinity as to be one Lord
God. And if Thou, O God, wert Thyself the Father, and wert Thyself the
Son, Thy Word Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit your gift, we should not
read in the book of truth, “God sent His Son;” <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md) nor wouldest Thou, O Only-begotten,
say of the Holy Spirit, “Whom the Father will send in my name;” <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md) and, “Whom I will send to you from
the Father.” <span id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) Directing my
purpose by this rule of faith, so far as I have been able, so far as
Thou hast made me to be able, I have sought Thee, and have desired to
see with my understanding what I believed; and I have argued and labored
much. O Lord my God, my one hope, hearken to me, lest through weariness
I be unwilling to seek Thee, “but that I may always ardently seek Thy
face.” <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md) Do Thou give strength
to seek, who hast made me find Thee, and hast given the hope of finding
Thee more and more. My strength and my infirmity are in Thy sight:
preserve the one, and heal the other. <span id="page_228">p. 228</span>
<span id="iv.i.xvii.xxviii-Page_228"></span>My knowledge and my
ignorance are in Thy sight; where Thou hast opened to me, receive me as
I enter; where Thou hast closed, open to me as I knock. May I remember
Thee, understand Thee, love Thee. Increase these things in me, until
Thou renewest me wholly. I know it is written, “In the multitude of
speech, thou shalt not escape sin.” <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md) But O that I might speak only in
preaching Thy word, and in praising Thee! Not only should I so flee from
sin, but I should earn good desert, however much I so spake. For a man
blessed of Thee would not enjoin a sin upon his own true son in the
faith, to whom he wrote, “Preach the word: be instant in season, out of
season.” <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) Are we to say that
he has not spoken much, who was not silent about Thy word, O Lord, not
only in season, but out of season? But therefore it was not much,
because it was only what was necessary. Set me free, O God, from that
multitude of speech which I suffer inwardly in my soul, wretched as it
is in Thy sight, and flying for refuge to Thy mercy; for I am not silent
in thoughts, even when silent in words. And if, indeed, I thought of
nothing save what pleased Thee, certainly I would not ask Thee to set me
free from such multitude of speech. But many are my thoughts, such as
Thou knowest, “thoughts of man, since they are vain.” <span
id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) Grant to me not to consent to them;
and if ever they delight me, nevertheless to condemn them, and not to
dwell in them, as though I slumbered. Nor let them so prevail in me, as
that anything in my acts should proceed from them; but at least let my
opinions, let my conscience, be safe from them, under Thy protection.
When the wise man spake of Thee in his book, which is now called by the
special name of Ecclesiasticus, “We speak,” he said, “much, and yet come
short; and in sum of words, He is all.” <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) When, therefore, we shall have come
to Thee, these very many things that we speak, and yet come short, will
cease; and Thou, as One, wilt remain “all in all.” <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md) And we shall say one thing without
end, in praising Thee in One, ourselves also made one in Thee. O Lord
the one God, God the Trinity, whatever I have said in these books that
is of Thine, may they acknowledge who are Thine; if anything of my own,
may it be pardoned both by Thee and by those who are Thine. Amen.
