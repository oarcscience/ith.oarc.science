<span id="v.ix.xii-p1"></span> 11. In regard to that woful compassion
which I have mentioned, are those praised, and by king David blessed,
who to the dry bones of Saul and Jonathan afforded mercy of
sepulture. <span id="fr_2734"></span>[2735](#fn_2734.md) But yet what mercy
is that, which is afforded to them that have feeling of nothing? Or
haply is this to be challenged back to that conceit of an infernal river
which men unburied were not able to pass over? Far be this from the
faith of Christians: else hath it gone most ill with so great a
multitude of Martyrs, for whom there could be no burying of their
bodies, and Truth did cheat them when It said, “Fear not them which kill
the body, and after that have no more that they can do,” <span
id="fr_2735"></span>[2736](#fn_2735.md) if these have been able to do to
them so great evils, by which they were hindered to pass over to the
places which they longed for. But, because this without all doubt is
most false, and it neither any whit hurts the faithful to have their
bodies denied sepulture, nor any whit the giving of sepulture unto
infidels advantageth them; why then are those who buried Saul and his
son said to have done mercy, and for this are blessed by that godly
king, but because it is a good affection with which the hearts of the
pitiful are touched, when they grieve for that in the dead bodies of
other men, which, by that affection through which no man ever hateth his
own flesh, they would not have done after their own death to their own
bodies; and what they would have done by them when they shall have no
more feeling, that they take care to do by others now having no feeling
while themselves have yet feeling?
