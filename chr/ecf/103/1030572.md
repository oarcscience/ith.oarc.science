<span id="v.iii.xix-p1"></span> 18. Wherefore I admonish both men and
women who follow after perpetual continence and holy virginity, that
they so set their own good before marriage, as that they judge not
marriage an evil: and that they understand that it was in no way of
deceit, but of plain truth that it was said by the Apostle, “Whoso gives
in marriage does well; and whoso gives not in marriage, does better;
and, if thou shalt have taken a wife, thou hast not sinned; and, if a
virgin shall have been married, she sinneth not;” <span
id="fr_2053"></span>[2054](#fn_2053.md) and a little after, “But she wilt
be more blessed, if she shall have continued so, according to my
judgment.” And, that the judgment should not be thought human, he adds,
“But I think I also have the Spirit of God.” This is the doctrine of the
Lord, this of the Apostles, this true, this sound, so to choose greater
gifts, as that the lesser be not condemned. The truth of God, in the
Scripture of God, is better than virginity of man in the mind or flesh
of any. Let what is chaste be so loved, as that what is true be not
denied. For what evil thought may they not have even concerning their
own flesh, who believe that the tongue of the Apostle, in that very
place, wherein he was commending virginity of body, was not virgin from
corruption of lying. In the first place, therefore, and chiefly, let
such as choose the good of virginity, hold most firmly that the holy
Scriptures have in nothing spoken lies; and, thus, that that also is
true which is said, “And if thou shall have taken a wife, thou hast not
sinned; and, if a virgin shall have been married, she sinneth not.” And
let them not think that the so great good of virgin chastity is made
less, if marriage shall not be an evil. Yea rather, let her hence feel
confident, rather, that there is prepared for her a palm of greater
glory, who feared not to be condemned, in case she were married, but
desired to receive a more honorable crown, in that she was not married.
Whoso therefore shall be willing to abide without marriage, let them not
flee from marriage as a pitfall of sin; but let them surmount it as a
hill of the lesser good, in order that they may rest in the mountain of
the greater, continence. It is on this condition, forsooth, that this
hill is dwelt on; that one leave it not when he will. For, “a woman is
bound, so long as her husband liveth.” <span
id="fr_2054"></span>[2055](#fn_2054.md) However unto widowed continence one
ascends from it as from a step: but for the sake of virgin continence,
one must either turn aside from it by not consenting to suitors, or
overleap it by anticipating suitors.
