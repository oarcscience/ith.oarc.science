<span id="v.iii.x-p1"></span> 9. Wherefore neither are we to believe
that their fruitfulness of the flesh, who at this time seek in marriage
nothing else save children, to make over unto Christ, can be set against
the loss of virginity. Forsooth, in former times, unto Christ about to
come after the flesh, the race itself of the flesh was needful, in a
certain large and prophetic nation: but now, when from out every race of
men, and from out all nations, members of Christ may be gathered unto
the People of God, and City of the kingdom of heaven, whoso can receive
sacred virginity, let him receive it; and let her only, who contains
not, be married. <span id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037.md) For what, if
any rich woman were to expend much money on this good work, and to buy,
from out different nations, <span id="page_420">p. 420</span> <span
id="v.iii.x-Page_420"></span>slaves to make Christians, will she not
provide for the giving birth to members of Christ in a manner more rich,
and more numerous, than by any, how great soever, fruitfulness of the
womb? And yet she will not therefore dare to compare her money to the
offering <span id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038.md) of holy virginity.
But if for the sake of making such as shall be born Christians,
fruitfulness of the flesh shall with just reason be set against the loss
of chastity, this matter will be more fruitful, if virginity be lost at
a great price of money, whereby many more children may be purchased to
be made Christians, than could be born from the womb, however fruitful,
of a single person. But, if it be extreme folly to say this, let the
faithful women that are married possess their own good, of which we have
treated, so far as seemed fit, in another volume; and let them more
highly honor, even as they are most rightly used to do, in the sacred
virgins, their better good, of which we are treating in our present
discourse.
