<span id="v.v.x-p1"></span> 9. But if no authority for lying can be
alleged, neither from the ancient Books, be it because that is not a lie
which is received to have been done or said in a figurative sense, or be
it because good men are not challenged to imitate that which in bad men,
beginning to amend, is praised in comparison with the worse; nor yet
from the books of the New Testament, because Peter’s correction rather
than his simulation, even as his tears rather than his denial, is what
we must imitate: then, as to those examples which are fetched from
common life, they assert much more confidently that there is no trust to
be given to these. For first they teach, that a lie is iniquity, by many
proofs of holy writ, especially by that which is written, “Thou, Lord,
hatest all workers of iniquity, thou shall destroy them that speak
leasing.” <span id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321) For either as the
Scripture is wont, in the following clause it expounds the former; so
that, as iniquity is a term of a wider meaning, leasing is named as the
particular sort of iniquity intended: or if they think there is any
difference between the two, leasing is by so much worse than iniquity as
“thou wilt destroy” is heavier than “thou hatest.” For it may be that
God hates a person to that degree more mildly, as not to destroy him,
but whom He destroys He hates the more exceedingly, by how much He
punisheth more severely. Now He hateth all who work iniquity: but all
who speak leasing He also destroyeth. Which thing being fixed, who of
them which assert this will be moved by those examples, when it is said,
suppose a man should seek shelter with thee who by thy lie may be saved
from death? For that death which men are foolishly afraid of who are not
afraid to sin, kills not the soul but the body, as the Lord teacheth in
the Gospel; whence He charges us not to fear that death: <span
id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322) but the mouth which lies kills not
the body but the soul. For in these words it is most plainly written,
“The mouth that lieth slayeth the soul.” <span
id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323) How then can it be said without the
greatest perverseness, that to the end one man may have life of the
body, it is another man’s duty to incur death of the soul? The love of
our neighbor hath its bounds in each man’s love of himself. “Thou shall
love,” saith He, “thy neighbor as thyself.” <span
id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324) How can a man be said to love as
himself that man, for whom that he may secure a temporal life, himself
loseth life eternal? Since if for his temporal life he lose but his own
temporal life, that is not to love as himself, but more than himself:
which exceeds the rule of sound doctrine. Much less then is he by
telling a lie to lose his own eternal for another’s temporal life. His
own temporal life, of course, for his neighbor’s eternal life a
Christian man will not hesitate to lose: for this example has gone
before, that the Lord died for us. To this point He also saith, “This is
my commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you. Greater
love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his
friends.” <span id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325) For none is so
foolish as to say that the Lord did other than consult for the eternal
salvation of men, whether in doing what He hath charged us to do, or in
charging us to do what Himself hath done. Since then by lying eternal
life is lost, never for any man’s temporal life must a lie be told. And
as to those who take it ill and are indignant that one should refuse to
tell a lie, and thereby slay his own soul in order that another may grow
old in the flesh; what if by our committing theft, what if by committing
adultery, a person might be delivered from death: are we therefore to
steal, to commit whoredom? They cannot prevail with themselves in a case
of this kind: namely, if a person should bring a halter and demand that
one should yield to his carnal lust, declaring that he will hang himself
unless his request be granted: they cannot prevail with themselves to
comply for the sake of, as they say, saving a life. If this is absurd
and wicked, why should a man corrupt his own soul with a lie in order
that another may live in the body, when, if he were to give his body to
be corrupted with such an object, he would in the judgment of all men be
held guilty of nefarious turpitude? Therefore the only point to be
attended to in this question is, whether a lie be iniquity. And since
this is asserted by the texts above rehearsed, we must see that to ask,
whether a man ought to tell a lie for the safety of another, is just the
same as asking whether for another’s safety a <span id="page_463">p.
463</span> <span id="v.v.x-Page_463"></span>man ought to commit
iniquity. But if the salvation of the soul rejects this, seeing it
cannot be secured but by equity, and would have us prefer it not only to
another’s, but even to our own temporal safety: what remains, say they,
that should make us doubt that a lie ought not to be told under any
circumstances whatsoever? For it cannot be said that there is aught
among temporal goods greater or dearer than the safety and life of the
body. Wherefore if not even that is to be preferred to truth, what can
be put in our way for the sake of which they who think it is sometimes
right to lie, can urge that a lie ought to be told?
