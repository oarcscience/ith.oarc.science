<span id="iv.vi.vii-p1"></span> 6. All these ways our Lord Jesus Christ
and His Apostles used. For when it had been objected that His disciples
had plucked the ears of corn on the sabbath-day, the instance was taken
from history; “Have ye not read,” saith He, “what David did when he was
an hungered, and they that were with him; how he entered into the house
of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat,
neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests?” <span

ætiology, that, when Christ had forbidden a wife to be put away, save
for the cause of fornication, and they, who asked Him, had alleged that
Moses had granted permission after a writing of divorcement had been
given, This, saith He, “Moses did because of the hardness of your
heart.” <span id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701.md) For here a reason was
given, why that had been well allowed by Moses for a time; that this
command of Christ might seem to show that now the times were other. But
it were long to explain the changes of these times, and <span

order arranged and settled by a certain marvellous appointment of Divine
Providence.
