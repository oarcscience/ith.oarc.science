<span id="v.iv.xv-p1"></span> 14. Wherefore I cannot indeed say, of
females who have fallen away from a better purpose, in case they shall
have married, that they are adulteries, not marriages; but I plainly
would not hesitate to say, that departures and fallings away from a
holier chastity, which is vowed unto the Lord, are worse than
adulteries. For if, what may no way be doubted, it pertains unto an
offense against Christ, when a member of Him keepeth not faith to her
husband; how much graver offense is it against Him, when unto Himself
faith is not kept, in a matter which He requires when offered, Who had
not required that it should be offered. For when each fails to render
that which, not by force of command, but by advice of counsel, he vowed,
by so much the more doth he increase the unrighteousness of the wrong
done to his vow, by how much the less necessity he had to vow. These
matters I for this reason treat of, that you may not think either that
second marriages are criminal, or that any marriages whatsoever, being
marriages, are an evil. Therefore let this be your mind, not that you
condemn them, but that you despise them. Therefore the good of widowed
chastity is becoming after a brighter fashion, in that in order to make
vow and profession of it, females may despise what is both pleasing and
lawful. But after profession of vow made they must continue to rein in,
and overcome, what is pleasing, because it is no longer lawful.
