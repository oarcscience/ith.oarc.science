<span id="v.viii.xi-p1"></span> 10. To this man let them <span
id="fr_2642"></span>[2643](#fn_2642) look who put themselves to death
when they are sought for to have life put upon them; and by bereaving
themselves of the present, deny and refuse also that which is to come.
Why, if people were driving them to deny Christ or to do any thing
contrary to righteousness, like true Martyrs, they ought rather to bear
all patiently than to dare death impatiently. If it could be right to do
this for the sake of running away from evils, holy Job would have killed
himself, that being in so great evils, in his estate, in his sons, in
his limbs, through the devil’s cruelty, he might escape them all. But he
did it not. Far be it from him, a wise man, to commit upon himself what
not even that unwise woman suggested. And if she had suggested it, she
would with good reason here also have had that answer which she had when
suggesting blasphemy; “Thou hast spoken as one of the foolish women. If
we have received good at the hand of the Lord, shall we not bear
evil?” <span id="fr_2643"></span>[2644](#fn_2643) Seeing even he also
would have lost patience, if either by blasphemy as she had suggested,
or by killing himself which not even she had dared to speak of, he
should die, and be among them of whom it is written, “Woe unto them that
have lost patience!” <span id="fr_2644"></span>[2645](#fn_2644) and
rather increase than escape pains, if after the death of his body he
should be hurried off to punishment either of blasphemers, or of
murderers, or of them which are worse even than parricides. For if a
parricide be on that account more wicked than any homicide, because he
kills not merely a man but a near relative; and among parricides too,
the nearer the person killed, the greater criminal he is judged to be:
without doubt worse still is he who kills himself, because there is none
nearer to a man than himself. What then do these miserable persons mean,
who, though both here they <span id="page_531">p. 531</span> <span
id="v.viii.xi-Page_531"></span>have inflicted pain upon themselves, and
hereafter not only for their impiety towards God but for the very
cruelty which they have exercised upon themselves will deservedly suffer
pains of His inflicting, do yet seek moreover the glories of Martyrs?
since, even if for the true testimony of Christ they suffered
persecution, and killed themselves, that they might not suffer any thing
from their persecutors, it would be rightly said to them, “Woe unto them
which have lost patience!” For how hath patience her just reward, if
even an impatient suffering receives the crown? or how shall that man be
judged innocent, to whom is said, “Thou shall love thy neighbor as
thyself,” <span id="fr_2645"></span>[2646](#fn_2645) if he commit murder
upon himself which he is forbidden to commit upon his neighbor?
