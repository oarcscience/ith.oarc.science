<span id="iv.ii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—The Restored Part of Humanity
Shall, in Accordance with the Promises of God, Succeed to the Place
Which the Rebellious Angels Lost.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxxi-p2"></span>And so it pleased God, the Creator and
Governor of the universe, that, since the whole body of the angels had
not fallen into rebellion, the part of them which had fallen should
remain in perdition eternally, and that the other part, which had in the
rebellion remained steadfastly loyal, should rejoice in the sure and
certain knowledge of their eternal happiness; but that, on the other
hand, mankind, who constituted the remainder of the intelligent
creation, having perished without exception under sin, both original and
actual, and the consequent punishments, should be in part restored, and
should fill up the gap which the rebellion and fall of the devils had
left in the company of the angels. For this is the promise to the
saints, that at the resurrection they shall be equal to the angels of
God. <span id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122.md) And thus the Jerusalem
which is above, which is the mother of us all, the city of God, shall
not be spoiled of any of the number of her citizens, shall perhaps reign
over even a more abundant population. We do not know the number either
of the saints or of the devils; but we know that the children of the
holy mother who was called barren on earth shall succeed to the place of
the fallen angels, and shall dwell for ever in that peaceful abode from
which they fell. But the number of the citizens, whether as it now is or
as it shall be, is present to the thoughts of the great Creator, who
calls those things which are not as though they were, <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123.md) and ordereth all things in measure,
and number, and weight. <span id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124.md)
