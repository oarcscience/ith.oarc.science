<span id="v.v.xxi-p1"></span> 20. But haply some may think that there is
an exception to be added; that there be some honest lies which not only
hurt no man, but profit some man, excepting those by which crimes are
screened and defended: so that the reason why the aforesaid lie is
disgraceful, is that, although it hurt no man, and profit the poor, it
screens a theft; but if it should in such sort hurt nobody and profit
somebody as not to screen and defend any sin, it would not be morally
wrong. As, put the case that some one should in thy sight hide his money
that he might not lose it by theft or violence, and thereupon being
questioned thou shouldest tell a lie; thou wouldest hurt no man, and
wouldest serve him who had need that his money were hidden, and wouldest
not have covered a sin by telling a lie. For it is no sin if a man hide
his property which he fears to lose. But, if we therefore sin not in
telling a lie, for that, while covering no man’s sin, we hurt nobody and
do good to somebody, what are we about as concerning the sin itself of a
lie? For where it is laid down, “Thou shalt not steal,” there is also
this, “Thou shall not bear false witness.” <span
id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331.md) Since then each is severally
prohibited, why is false witness culpable if it cover a theft or any
other sin, but if without any screening of sin it be done by itself,
then not culpable, whereas stealing is culpable in and by itself, and so
other sins? Or is it so that to hide a sin is not lawful; to do it,
lawful?
