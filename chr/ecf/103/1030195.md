<span id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—Other Advantages of the
Incarnation.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p2"></span>22. There are many other things also
in the incarnation of Christ, displeasing as it is to the proud, that
are to be observed and thought of advantageously. And one of them is,
that it has been demonstrated to man what place he has in the things
which God has created; since human nature could so be joined to God,
that one person could be made of two substances, and thereby indeed of
three—God, soul, and flesh: so that those proud malignant spirits, who
interpose themselves as mediators to deceive, although as if to help, do
not therefore dare to place themselves above man because they have not
flesh; and chiefly because the Son of God deigned to die also in the
same flesh, lest they, because they seem to be immortal, should
therefore succeed in getting themselves worshipped as gods. Further,
that the grace of God might be commended to us in the man Christ without
any precedent merits; because not even He Himself obtained by any
precedent merits that He should be joined in such great unity with the
true God, and should become the Son of God, one Person with Him; but
from the time when He began to be man, from that time He is also God;
whence it is said, “The Word was made flesh.” <span
id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838) Then, again, there is this, that the
pride of man, which is the chief hindrance against his cleaving to God,
can be confuted and healed through such great humility of God. Man
learns also how far he has gone away from God; and what it is worth to
him as a pain to cure him, when he returns through such a Mediator, who
both as God assists men by His divinity, and as man agrees with men by
His weakness. For what greater example of obedience could be given to
us, who had perished through disobedience, <span id="page_180">p.
180</span> <span id="iv.i.xv.xvii-Page_180"></span>than God the Son
obedient to God the Father, even to the death of the cross? <span
id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839) Nay, wherein could the reward of
obedience itself be better shown, than in the flesh of so great a
Mediator, which rose again to eternal life? It belonged also to the
justice and goodness of the Creator, that the devil should be conquered
by the same rational creature which he rejoiced to have conquered, and
by one that came from that same race which, by the corruption of its
origin through one, he held altogether.
