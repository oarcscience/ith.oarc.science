<span id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—The Unobligated Death of Christ
Has Freed Those Who Were Liable to Death.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p2"></span>18. What, then, is the righteousness by
which the devil was conquered? What, except the righteousness of Jesus
Christ? And how was he conquered? Because, when he found in Him nothing
worthy of death, yet he slew Him. And certainly it is just, that we whom
he held as debtors, should be dismissed free by believing in Him whom he
slew without any debt. In this way it is that we are said to be
justified in the blood of Christ. <span
id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820) For so that innocent blood was shed
for the remission of our sins. Whence He calls Himself in the Psalms,
“Free among the dead.” <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821) For he
only that is dead is free from the debt of death. Hence also in another
psalm He says, “Then I restored that which I seized not;” <span
id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822) meaning sin by the thing seized,
because sin is laid hold of against what is lawful. Whence also He says,
by the mouth of His own Flesh, as is read in the Gospel: “For the prince
of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me,” that is, no sin; but
“that the world may know,” He says, “that I do the commandment of the
Father; arise, let us go hence.” <span id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823)
And hence He proceeds to His passion, that He might pay for us debtors
that which He Himself did not owe. Would then the devil be conquered by
this most just right, if Christ had willed to deal with him by power,
not by righteousness? But He held back what was possible to Him, in
order that He might first do what was fitting. And hence it was
necessary that He should be both man and God. For unless He had been
man, He could not have been slain; unless He had been God, men would not
have believed that He would not do what He could, but that He could not
do what He would; nor should we have thought that righteousness was
preferred by Him to power, but that He lacked power. But now He suffered
for us things belonging to man, because He was man; but if He had been
unwilling, it would have been in His power to not so to suffer, because
He was also God. And righteousness was therefore made more acceptable in
humility, because so great power as was in His Divinity, if He had been
unwilling, would have been able not to suffer humility; and thus by Him
who died, being thus powerful, both righteousness was commended, and
power promised, to us, weak mortals. For He did one of these two things
by dying, the other by rising again. For what is more righteous, than to
come even to the death of the cross for righteousness? And what more
powerful, than to rise from the dead, and to ascend into heaven with
that very flesh in which He was slain? And therefore He conquered the
devil first by righteousness, and afterwards by power: namely, by
righteousness, because He had no sin, and was slain by him most
unjustly; but by power, because having been dead He lived again, never
afterwards to die. <span id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824) But He would
have conquered the devil by power, even though He could not have been
slain by him: although it belongs to a greater power to conquer death
itself also by rising again, than to avoid it by living. But the reason
is really a different one, why we are justified in the blood of Christ,
when we are rescued from the power of the devil through the remission of
sins: it pertains to this, that the devil is conquered by Christ by
righteousness, not by power. For Christ was crucified, not through
immortal power, but through the weakness which He took upon Him in
mortal flesh; of which weakness nevertheless the apostle says, “that the
weakness of God is stronger than men.” <span
