<span id="v.vii.xxxv-p1"></span> 34. But then the Lord saith, “Be not
solicitous for your life what ye shall eat, nor for the body, what ye
shall put on.” Rightly: because He had said above, “Ye cannot serve God
and mammon.” For he who preaches the Gospel with an eye to this, that he
may have whereof he may eat and whereof be clothed, accounts that he at
the same time both serves God, because he preaches the Gospel; and
mammon, because he preaches with an eye to these necessaries: which
thing the Lord saith to be impossible. And hereby he who doth for the
sake of these things preach the Gospel is convicted that he serves not
God but mammon; however God may use him, he knows not how, to other
men’s advancement. For to this sentence doth He subjoin, saying
“Therefore I say unto you, Be not solicitous for your life what ye shall
eat, nor for your body what ye shall put on:” not that they should not
procure these things, as much as is enough for necessity, by what means
they honestly may; but that they should not look to these things, and
for the sake of these do whatever in preaching of the Gospel they are
bidden to do. The intention, namely, for which a thing is done, He calls
the eye: of which a little above He was speaking with purpose to come
down to this, and saying, “The light of thy body is thine eye: if thine
eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light; but if thine eye
<span id="page_520">p. 520</span> <span
id="v.vii.xxxv-Page_520"></span>be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
darkness;” that is, such will be thy deeds as shall be thine intention
for which thou doest them. For indeed that He might come to this, He had
before given precept concerning alms, saying, “Lay not up for yourselves
treasures on earth where rust and moth doth corrupt, and where thieves
break through and steal. But lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven,
where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break
through nor steal. For where thy treasure shall be, there will thy heart
be also.” <span id="fr_2581"></span>[2582](#fn_2581) Thereupon He
subjoined, “The light of thy body is thine eye:” that they, to wit,
which do alms, do them not with that intention that they should either
wish to please men, or seek to have repayment on earth of the alms they
do. Whence the Apostle, giving charge to Timothy for warning of rich
men, “Let them,” says he “readily give, communicate, treasure up for
themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay
hold on the true life.” <span id="fr_2582"></span>[2583](#fn_2582) Since
then the Lord hath to the future life directed the eye of them which do
alms, and to an heavenly reward, in order that the deeds themselves may
be full of light when the eye shall be simple, (for of that last
retribution is meant that which He says in another place, “He that
receiveth you receiveth Me, and he that receiveth Me receiveth Him that
sent Me. He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the
name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward. And
whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of
cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, his
reward shall not be lost,” <span id="fr_2583"></span>[2584](#fn_2583) )
lest haply after he had reproved the eye <span
id="fr_2584"></span>[2585](#fn_2584) of them which bestow things needful
upon the indigent both prophets and just men and disciples of the Lord,
the eye of the persons to whom these things were done should become
depraved, so that for the sake of receiving these things they should
wish to serve Christ as His soldiers: “No man,” saith He, “can serve two
masters.” And a little after: “Ye cannot,” saith He, “serve God and
mammon.” <span id="fr_2585"></span>[2586](#fn_2585) And straightway He
hath added, “Therefore I say unto you, be not solicitous for your life
what ye shall eat, nor for the body what ye shall put on.”
