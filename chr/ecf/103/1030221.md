<span id="iv.i.xvii.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.i.xvii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—God, Although Incomprehensible,
is Ever to Be Sought. The Traces of the Trinity are Not Vainly Sought in
the Creature.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvii.ii-p2"></span>2. For God Himself, whom we seek,
will, as I hope, help our labors, that they may not be unfruitful, and
that we may understand how it is said in the holy Psalm, “Let the heart
of them rejoice that seek the Lord. Seek the Lord, and be strengthened:
seek His face evermore.” <span id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937) For
that which is always being sought seems as though it were never found;
and how then will the heart of them that seek rejoice, and not rather be
made sad, if they cannot find what they seek? For it is not said, The
heart shall rejoice of them that find, but of them that seek, the Lord.
And yet the prophet Isaiah testifies, that the Lord God can be found
when He is sought, when he says: “Seek ye the Lord; and as soon as ye
have found Him, call upon Him: and when He has drawn near to you, let
the wicked man forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts.” <span id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938) If, then, when
sought, He can be found, why is it said, “Seek ye His face evermore?” Is
He perhaps to be sought even when found? For things incomprehensible
must so be investigated, as that no one may think he has found nothing,
when he has been able to find how incomprehensible that is which he was
seeking. Why then does he so seek, if he comprehends that which he seeks
to be incomprehensible, unless because he may not give over seeking so
long as he makes progress in the inquiry itself into things <span
id="page_200">p. 200</span> <span
id="iv.i.xvii.ii-Page_200"></span>incomprehensible, and becomes ever
better and better while seeking so great a good, which is both sought in
order to be found, and found in order to be sought? For it is both
sought in order that it may be found more sweetly, and found in order
that it may be sought more eagerly. The words of Wisdom in the book of
Ecclesiasticus may be taken in this meaning: “They who eat me shall
still be hungry, and they who drink me shall still be thirsty.” <span
id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939) For they eat and drink because they
find; and they still continue seeking because they are hungry and
thirst. Faith seeks, understanding finds; whence the prophet says,
“Unless ye believe, ye shall not understand.” <span
id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940) And yet, again, understanding still
seeks Him, whom it finds; for “God looked down upon the sons of men,” as
it is sung in the holy Psalm, “to see if there were any that would
understand, and seek after God.” <span id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941)
And man, therefore, ought for this purpose to have understanding, that
he may seek after God.

<span id="iv.i.xvii.ii-p8"></span>3. We shall have tarried then long
enough among those things that God has made, in order that by them He
Himself may be known that made them. “For the invisible things of Him
from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the
things that are made.” <span id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942) And hence
they are rebuked in the book of Wisdom, “who could not out of the good
things that are seen know Him that is: neither by considering the works
did they acknowledge the workmaster; but deemed either fire, or wind, or
the swift air or the circle of the stars, or the violent water, or the
lights of heaven, to be the gods which govern the world: with whose
beauty if they, being delighted, took them to be gods, let them know how
much better the Lord of them is; for the first Author of beauty hath
created them. But if they were astonished at their power and virtue, let
them understand by them how much mightier He is that made them. For by
the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the Maker of
them is seen.” <span id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943) I have quoted
these words from the book of Wisdom for this reason, that no one of the
faithful may think me vainly and emptily to have sought first in the
creature, step by step through certain trinities, each of their own
appropriate kind, until I came at last to the mind of man, traces of
that highest Trinity which we seek when we seek God.
