<span id="iv.i.viii-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv.i.viii-p3"></span>The question is proposed, how the apostle
calls Christ “the power of God, and the wisdom of God.” And an argument
is raised, whether the Father is not wisdom Himself, but only the Father
of wisdom; or whether Wisdom begat Wisdom. But the answer to this is
deferred for a little, while the unity and equality of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, are proved; and that we ought to
believe in a Trinity, not in a threefold (triplicem) god. Lastly, that
saying of Hilary is explained, eternity in the Father, appearance in the
image, use in the gift.
