<span id="v.vii.xxxi-p1"></span> 30. Wherefore, that I may briefly
embrace the whole matter, let these persons, who from perverse
understanding of the Gospel labor to pervert apostolical precepts,
either take no thought for the morrow, even as the birds of the air; or
let them obey the Apostle, as dear children: yea rather, let them do
both, because both accord. For things contrary to his Lord, Paul the
servant of Jesus Christ would never advise. <span
id="fr_2569"></span>[2570](#fn_2569.md) This then we say openly to these
persons; If the birds of the air ye in such wise understand in the
Gospel, that ye will not by working with your hands procure food and
clothing; then neither must ye put any thing by for the morrow, like as
the birds of the air do put nothing by. But if to put somewhat by for
the morrow, is possibly not against the Gospel where it is said, “Behold
the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into
stores;” <span id="fr_2570"></span>[2571](#fn_2570.md) then is it possibly
not against the Gospel nor against similitude of the birds of the air,
to maintain this life of the flesh by labor of corporal working.
