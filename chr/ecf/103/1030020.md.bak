<span id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Diverse Things are Spoken
Concerning the Same Christ, on Account of the Diverse Natures of the One
Hypostasis \[Theanthropic Person\]. Why It is Said that the Father Will
Not Judge, But Has Given Judgment to the Son.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p2"></span>28. Yet unless the very same were the
Son of man on account of the form of a servant which He took, who is the
Son of God on account of the form of God in which He is; Paul the
apostle would not say of the princes of this world, “For had they known
it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.” <span
id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) For He was crucified after the form of
a servant, and yet “the Lord of glory” was crucified. For that “taking”
was such as to make God man, and man God. Yet what is said on account of
what, and what according to what, the thoughtful, diligent, and pious
reader discerns for himself, the Lord being his helper. For instance, we
have said that He glorifies His own, as being God, and certainly then as
being the Lord of glory; and yet the Lord of glory was crucified,
because even God is rightly said to have been crucified, not after the
power of the divinity, but after the weakness of the flesh: <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) just as we say, that He judges as God,
that is, by divine power, not by human; and yet the man Himself will
judge, just as the Lord of glory was crucified: for so He expressly
says, “When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy
angels with Him, and before Him shall be gathered all nations;” <span
id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) and the rest that is foretold of the
future judgment in that place even to the last sentence. And the Jews,
inasmuch as they will be punished in that judgment for persisting in
their wickedness, as it is elsewhere written, “shall look upon Him whom
they have pierced.” <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) For whereas
both good and bad shall see the Judge of the quick and dead, without
doubt the bad will not be able to see Him, except after the form in
which He is the Son of man; but yet in the glory wherein He will judge,
not in the lowliness wherein He was judged. But the ungodly without
doubt will not see that form of God in which He is equal to the Father.
For they are not pure in heart; and “Blessed are the pure in heart: for
they shall see God.” <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) And that
sight is face to face, <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) the very
sight that is promised as the highest reward to the just, and which will
then take place when He “shall have delivered up the kingdom to God,
even the Father;” and in this “kingdom” He means the sight of His own
form also to be understood, the whole creature being made subject to
God, including that wherein the Son of God was made the Son of man.
Because, according to this creature, “The Son also Himself shall be
subject unto Him, that put all things under Him, that God may be all in
all.” <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) Otherwise if the Son of
God, judging in the form in which He is equal to the Father, shall
appear when He judges to the ungodly also; what becomes of that which He
promises, as some great thing, to him who loves Him, saying, “And I will
love him, and will manifest myself to him?” <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) Wherefore He will judge as the Son of
man, yet not by human power, but by that whereby He is the Son of God;
and on the other hand, He will judge as the Son of God, yet not
appearing in that \[unincarnate\] form in which He is God equal to the
Father, but in that \[incarnate form\] in which He is the Son of
man. <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p12"></span>29. Therefore both ways of speaking
may be used; the Son of man will judge, and, the Son of man will not
judge: since the Son of man will judge, that the text may be true which
says, “When the Son of man shall come, then before Him shall be gathered
all nations;” and the Son of man will not judge, that the text may be
true which says, “I will not judge him;” <span
id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) and, “I seek not mine own glory: there
is One that seeketh and judgeth.” <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) For in respect to this, that in the
judgment, not the form of God, but the form of the Son of man will
appear, the Father Himself will not judge; for according to this <span
id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span id="iv.i.iii.xiii-Page_34"></span>it is
said, “For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
unto the Son.” Whether this is said after that mode of speech which we
have mentioned above, where it is said, “So hath He given to the Son to
have life in Himself,” <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) that it
should signify that so He begat the Son; or, whether after that of which
the apostle speaks, saying, “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him,
and given Him a name which is above every name:”—(For this is said of
the Son of man, in respect to whom the Son of God was raised from the
dead; since He, being in the form of God equal to the Father, wherefrom
He “emptied” Himself by taking the form of a servant, both acts and
suffers, and receives, in that same form of a servant, what the apostle
goes on to mention: “He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death,
even the death of the cross; wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him,
and given Him a name which is above every name; that at the name of
Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth,
and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that
Jesus Christ is Lord, in the Glory of God the Father:” <span
id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) —whether then the words, “He hath
committed all judgment unto the Son,” are said according to this or that
mode of speech; it sufficiently appears from this place, that if they
were said according to that sense in which it is said, “He hath given to
the Son to have life in Himself,” it certainly would not be said, “The
Father judgeth no man.” For in respect to this, that the Father hath
begotten the Son equal to Himself, He judges with Him. Therefore it is
in respect to this that it is said, that in the judgment, not the form
of God, but the form of the Son of man will appear. Not that He will not
judge, who hath committed all judgment unto the Son, since the Son saith
of Him, “There is One that seeketh and judgeth:” but it is so said, “The
Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son;” as
if it were said, No one will see the Father in the judgment of the quick
and the dead, but all will see the Son: because He is also the Son of
man, so that He can be seen even by the ungodly, since they too shall
see Him whom they have pierced.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p17"></span>30. Lest, however, we may seem to
conjecture this rather than to prove it clearly, let us produce a
certain and plain sentence of the Lord Himself, by which we may show
that this was the cause why He said, “The Father judgeth no man, but
hath committed all judgment unto the Son,” *viz*. because He will appear
as Judge in the form of the Son of man, which is not the form of the
Father, but of the Son; nor yet that form of the Son in which He is
equal to the Father, but that in which He is less than the Father; in
order that, in the judgment, He may be visible both to the good and to
the bad. For a little while after He says, “Verily, verily, I say unto
you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on Him that sent me, hath
everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but shall
pass <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) from death unto life.” Now
this life eternal is that sight which does not belong to the bad. Then
follows, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now
is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that
hear shall live.” <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) And this is
proper to the godly, who so hear of His incarnation, as to believe that
He is the Son of God, that is, who so receive Him, as made for their
sakes less than the Father, in the form of a servant, that they believe
Him equal to the Father, in the form of God. And thereupon He continues,
enforcing this very point, “For as the Father hath life in Himself, so
hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself.” And then He comes to
the sight of His own glory, in which He shall come to judgment; which
sight will be common to the ungodly and to the just. For He goes on to
say, “And hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He
is the Son of man.” <span id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) I think
nothing can be more clear. For inasmuch as the Son of God is equal to
the Father, He does not receive this power of executing judgment, but He
has it with the Father in secret; but He receives it, so that the good
and the bad may see Him judging, inasmuch as He is the Son of man. Since
the sight of the Son of man will be shown to the bad also: for the sight
of the form of God will not be shown except to the pure in heart, for
they shall see God; that is, to the godly only, to whose love He
promises this very thing, that He will show Himself to them. And see,
accordingly, what follows: “Marvel not at this,” He says. Why does He
forbid us to marvel, unless it be that, in truth, every one marvels who
does not understand, that therefore He said the Father gave Him power
also to execute judgment, because He is the Son of man; whereas, it
might rather have been anticipated that He would say, since He is the
Son of God? But because the wicked are not able to see the Son of God as
He is in the form of God equal to the Father, <span id="page_35">p.
35</span> <span id="iv.i.iii.xiii-Page_35"></span>but yet it is
necessary that both the just and the wicked should see the Judge of the
quick and dead, when they will be judged in His presence; “Marvel not at
this,” He says, “for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in
the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have
done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil,
unto the resurrection of damnation.” <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) For this purpose, then, it was
necessary that He should therefore receive that power, because He is the
Son of man, in order that all in rising again might see Him in the form
in which He can be seen by all, but by some to damnation, by others to
life eternal. And what is life eternal, unless that sight which is not
granted to the ungodly? “That they might know Thee,” He says, “the One
true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.” <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) And how are they to know Jesus Christ
Himself also, unless as the One true God, who will show Himself to them;
not as He will show Himself, in the form of the Son of man, to those
also that shall be punished? <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p24"></span>31. He is “good,” according to that
sight, according to which God appears to the pure in heart; for “truly
God is good unto Israel even to such as are of a clean heart.” <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) But when the wicked shall see the
Judge, He will not seem good to them; because they will not rejoice in
their heart to see Him, but all “kindreds of the earth shall then wail
because of Him,” <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) namely, as
being reckoned in the number of all the wicked and unbelievers. On this
account also He replied to him, who had called Him Good Master, when
seeking advice of Him how he might attain eternal life, “Why askest thou
me about good? <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) there is none
good but One, that is, God.” <span id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) And
yet the Lord Himself, in another place, calls man good: “A good man,” He
says, “out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good
things: and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth
forth evil things.” <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) But because
that man was seeking eternal life, and eternal life consists in that
contemplation in which God is seen, not for punishment, but for
everlasting joy; and because he did not understand with whom he was
speaking, and thought Him to be only the Son of man: <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) Why, He says, askest thou me about
good? that is, with respect to that form which thou seest, why askest
thou about good, and callest me, according to what thou seest, Good
Master? This is the form of the Son of man, the form which has been
taken, the form that will appear in judgment, not only to the righteous,
but also to the ungodly; and the sight of this form will not be for good
to those who are wicked. But there is a sight of that form of mine, in
which when I was, I thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but in
order to take this form I emptied myself. <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) That one God, therefore, the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit, who will not appear, except for joy
which cannot be taken away from the just; for which future joy he sighs,
who says, “One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after;
that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to
behold the beauty of the Lord:” <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md)
that one God, therefore, Himself, I say, is alone good, for this reason,
that no one sees Him for sorrow and wailing, but only for salvation and
true joy. If you understand me after this latter form, then I am good;
but if according to that former only, then why askest thou me about
good? If thou art among those who “shall look upon Him whom they have
pierced,” <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) that very sight itself
will be evil to them, because it will be penal. That after this meaning,
then, the Lord said, “Why askest thou me about good? there is none good
but One, that is, God,” is probable upon those proofs which I have
alleged, because that sight of God, whereby we shall contemplate the
substance of God unchangeable and invisible to human eyes (which is
promised to the saints alone; which the Apostle Paul speaks of, as “face
to face;” <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) and of which the
Apostle John says, “We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He
is;” <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) and of which it is said,
“One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I may behold the beauty of
the Lord,” and of which the Lord Himself says, “I will both love him,
and will manifest myself to him;” <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) and on account of which alone we
cleanse our hearts by faith, that we may be those “pure in heart who are
blessed for they shall see God:” <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md)
and what<span id="page_36">p. 36</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.xiii-Page_36"></span>ever else is spoken of that sight:
which whosoever turns the eye of love to seek it, may find most
copiously scattered through all the Scriptures),—that sight alone, I
say, is our chief good, for the attaining of which we are directed to do
whatever we do aright. But that sight of the Son of man which is
foretold, when all nations shall be gathered before Him, and shall say
to Him, “Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, or thirsty, etc.?” will
neither be a good to the ungodly, who shall be sent into everlasting
fire, nor the chief good to the righteous. For He still goes on to call
these to the kingdom which has been prepared for them from the
foundation of the world. For, as He will say to those, “Depart into
everlasting fire;” so to these, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you.” And as those will go into everlasting
burning; so the righteous will go into life eternal. But what is life
eternal, except “that they may know Thee,” He says, “the One true God,
and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent?” <span
id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) but know Him now in that glory of
which He says to the Father, “Which I had with Thee before the world
was.” <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) For then He will deliver
up the kingdom to God, even the Father, <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) that the good servant may enter into
the joy of his Lord, <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) and that He
may hide those whom God keeps in the hiding of His countenance from the
confusion of men, namely, of those men who shall then be confounded by
hearing this sentence; of which evil hearing “the righteous man shall
not be afraid” <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) if only he be
kept in “the tabernacle,” that is, in the true faith of the Catholic
Church, from “the strife of tongues,” <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) that is, from the sophistries of
heretics. But if there is any other explanation of the words of the
Lord, where He says, “Why asketh thou me about good? there is none good,
but One, that is, God;” provided only that the substance of the Father
be not therefore believed to be of greater goodness than that of the
Son, according to which He is the Word by whom all things were made; and
if there is nothing in it abhorrent from sound doctrine; let us securely
use it, and not one explanation only, but as many as we are able to
find. For so much the more powerfully are the heretics proved wrong, the
more outlets are open for avoiding their snares. But let us now start
afresh, and address ourselves to the consideration of that which still
remains.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p11"></span> \[Augustin in this discussion,
sometimes employs the phrase “Son of man” to denote the human nature of
Christ, in distinction from the divine. But in Scripture and in
trinitarian theology generally, this phrase properly denotes the whole
theanthropic *person* under a human title—just as “man”, ([1 Tim.
2.5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p11.1"></span>[1 Tim. ii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p11.2"></span>), “last Adam” ([1 Cor.
15.45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p11.3"></span>[1 Cor. xv.
45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p11.4"></span>), and “second man” ([1 Cor.
15.47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p11.5"></span>[1 Cor. xv.
47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p11.6"></span>), denote not the human nature, but the
whole divine-human person under a human title. Strictly used, the phrase
“Son of man” does not designate the difference between the divine and
human natures in the theanthropos, but between the person of the
*un*-incarnate and that of the incarnate Logos. Augustin’s meaning is,
that the Son of God will judge men at the last day, not in his original
“form of God,” but as this is united with human nature—as the Son of
man.—W.G.T.S.\]

<span id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p23"></span> \[Augustin here seems to teach that
the phenomenal appearance of Christ to the redeemed in heaven will be
different from that to all men in the day of judgment. He says that he
will show himself to the former “in the form of God;” to the latter, “in
the form of the Son of man.” But, surely, it is one and the same God-man
who sits on the judgment throne, and the heavenly throne. His appearance
must be the same in both instances: namely, that of God incarnate. The
*effect* of his phenomenal appearance upon the believer will, indeed, be
very different from that upon the unbeliever. For the wicked, this
vision of God incarnate will be one of terror; for the redeemed one of
joy.—W.G.T.S.\]

here, as in some other places, employs the phrase “Son of man” to denote

one person, and designated by this human title. The latter is the
Scripture usage. As “Immanuel” does not properly denote the divine
nature, but the union of divinity and humanity, so “Son of man” does not
properly denote the human nature, but the union of divinity and
