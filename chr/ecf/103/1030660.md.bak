<span id="v.v.xvii-p1"></span> 16. Or, are some lies, also, to be
excepted, so that it were better to suffer this than to commit those? If
so, then not every thing <span id="page_466">p. 466</span> <span
id="v.v.xvii-Page_466"></span>that is done in order to the avoiding of
that defilement ceases to be sin; seeing there are some lies to commit
which is worse than to suffer that foul violence. For, suppose quest be
making after a person that his body may be deflowered, and that it be
possible to screen him by a lie; who dares to say that even in such a
case a lie ought not be told? But, if the lie by which he may be
concealed be one which may hurt the fair fame of another, by bringing
upon him a false accusation of that very uncleanness, to suffer which
the other is sought after; as, if it should be said to the inquirer, “Go
to such an one,” (naming some chaste man who is a stranger to vices of
this kind,) “and he will procure for you one whom you will find a more
willing subject, for he knows and loves such;” and thereby the person
might be diverted from him whom he sought: I know not whether one man’s
fair fame ought to be violated by a lie, in order that another’s body
may not be violated by lust to which he is a stranger. And in general,
it is never right to tell a lie for any man, such as may hurt another,
even if the hurt be slighter than would be the hurt to him unless such a
lie were told. Because neither must another man’s bread be taken from
him against his will, though he be in good health, and it is to feed one
who is weak; nor must an innocent man, against his will, be beaten with
rods, that another may not be killed. Of course, if they are willing,
let it be done, because they are not hurt if they be willing that so it
should be: but whether, even with his own consent, a man’s fair fame
ought to be hurt with a false charge of foul lusts, in order that lust
may be averted from another’s body, is a great question. And I know not
whether it be easy to find in what way it can be just that a man’s fair
fame, even with his consent, should be stained with a false charge of
lust, any more than a man’s body should be polluted by the lust itself
against his will.
