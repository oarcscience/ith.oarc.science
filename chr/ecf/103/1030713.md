<span id="v.vi.xxv-p1"></span> 24. Touching Jacob, however, that which
he did at his mother’s bidding, so as to seem to deceive his father, if
with diligence and in faith it be attended to, is no lie, but a mystery.
The which if we shall call lies, all parables also, and figures designed
for the signifying of any things soever, which are not to be taken
according to their proper meaning, but in them is one thing to be
understood from another, shall be said to be lies: which be far from us
altogether. For he who thinks this, may also in regard of tropical
expressions of which there are so many, bring in upon all of them this
calumny; so that even metaphor, as it is called, that is, the usurped
transferring of any word from its proper object to an object not proper,
may at this rate be called a lie. For when he speaks of waving
corn-fields, of vines putting forth gems, <span
id="fr_2416"></span>[2417](#fn_2416.md) of the bloom of youth, of snowy
hairs; without doubt the waves, the gems, the bloom, the snow, for that
we find them not in those objects to which we have from other
transferred these words, shall by these persons be accounted lies. And
Christ a Rock, and the stony heart of the Jews; also, Christ a Lion, and
the devil a lion, and innumerable such like, shall be said to be
lies. <span id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417.md) Nay, this tropical
expression reaches even to what is called antiphrasis, as when a thing
is said to abound which does not exist, a thing said to be sweet which
is sour; “*lucus quod non luceat, Parcæ quod non parcant*.” Of which
kind is that in holy Scripture, “If he will not bless <span
id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418.md) Thee to Thy face;” which the devil
saith to the Lord concerning holy Job, and the meaning is “curse.” By
which word also the feigned crime of Naboth is named by his
calumniators; for it is said that he “blessed <span
id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419.md) the king,” that is, cursed. All
these modes of speaking shall be accounted lies, if figurative speech or
action shall be set down as lying. But if it be no lie, when things
which signify one thing by another are referred to the understanding of
a truth, assuredly not only that which Jacob did or said to his father
that he might be blessed, but that too which Joseph spoke as if in
mockery of his brothers, <span id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420.md) and
David’s feigning of madness, <span id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421.md)
must be judged to be no lies, but prophetical speeches and actions, to
be referred to the understanding of those things which are true; which
are covered as it were with a garb of figure on purpose to exercise the
sense of the pious inquirer, and that they may not become cheap by lying
bare and on the surface. Though even the things which we have learned
from other places, where they are spoken openly and manifestly, these,
when they are brought out from their hidden retreats, do, by our (in
some sort) discovering of them, become re<span id="page_492">p.
492</span> <span id="v.vi.xxv-Page_492"></span>newed , and by renewal
sweet. Nor is it that they are begrudged to the learners, in that they
are in these ways obscured; but are presented in a more winning manner,
that being as it were withdrawn, they may be desired more ardently, and
being desired may with more pleasure be found. Yet true things, not
false, are spoken; because true things, not false, are signified,
whether by word or by deed; the things that are signified namely, those
are the things spoken. They are accounted lies only because people do
not understand that the true things which are signified are the things
said, but believe that false things are the things said. To make this
plainer by examples, attend to this very thing that Jacob did. With
skins of the kids, no doubt, he did cover his limbs; if we seek the
immediate cause, we shall account him to have lied; for he did this,
that he might be thought to be the man he was not: but if this deed be
referred to that for the signifying of which it was really done, by
skins of the kids are signified sins; by him who covered himself
therewith, He who bare not His own, but others’ sins. The truthful
signification, therefore, can in no wise be rightly called a lie. And as
in deed, so also in word. Namely, when his father said to him, “Who art
thou my son?” <span id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422.md) he answered, “I
am Esau, thy first-born.” This, if it be referred to those two twins,
will seem a lie; but if to that for the signifying of which those deeds
and words are written, He is here to be understood, in His body, which
is His Church, Who, speaking of this thing, saith, “When ye shall see
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of
God, and yourselves cast out. And they shall come from the east and from
the west and from the north and from the south, and shall sit down in
the kingdom of God; and, behold, there are last which shall be first,
and there are first which shall be last.” <span
id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423.md) For so in a certain sort the
younger brother did bear off the primacy of the elder brother, and
transfer it to himself. Since then things so true, and so truthfully, be
signified, what is there here that ought to be accounted to have been
done or said lyingly? For when the things which are signified are not in
truth things which are not, but which are, whether past or present or
future, without doubt it is a true signification, and no lie. But it
takes too long in the matter of this prophetical signification by
stripping off the shell to search out all, <span
id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424.md) wherein truth hath the palm,
because as by being signified they were fore-announced, so by ensuing
have they become clear.
