<span id="iv.vii.xv-p1"></span> 15. “Forgiveness of sins.” Ye have
\[this article of\] the Creed perfectly in you when ye receive Baptism.
Let none say, “I have done this or that sin: perchance that is not
forgiven me.” What hast thou done? How great a sin hast thou done? Name
any heinous thing thou hast committed, heavy, horrible, which thou
shudderest even to think of: have done what thou wilt: hast thou killed
Christ? There is not than that deed any worse, because also than Christ
there is nothing better. What a dreadful thing is it to kill Christ! Yet
the Jews killed Him, and many afterwards believed on Him and drank His
blood: they are forgiven the sin which they committed. When ye have been
baptized, hold fast a good life in the commandments of God, that ye may
guard your Baptism even unto the end. I do not tell you that ye will
live here without sin; but they are venial, without which this life is
not. For the sake of all sins was Baptism provided; for the sake of
light sins, without which we cannot be, was prayer provided. <span
id="fr_1802"></span>[1803](#fn_1802.md) What hath <span id="page_375">p.
375</span> <span id="iv.vii.xv-Page_375"></span>the Prayer? “Forgive us
our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.” <span
id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803.md) Once for all we have washing in
Baptism, every day we have washing in prayer. Only, do not commit those
things for which ye must needs be separated from Christ’s body: which be
far from you! For those whom ye have seen doing penance, <span
id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804.md) have committed heinous things,
either adulteries or some enormous crimes: for these they do penance.
Because if theirs had been light sins, to blot out these daily prayer
would suffice.
