themselves, we may no way doubt that the chastity of continence is
better than marriage chastity, whilst yet both are good: but when we
compare the persons, he is better, who hath a greater good than another.
Further, he who hath a greater of the same kind, hath also that which is
less; but he, who only hath what is less, assuredly hath not that which
is greater. For in sixty, thirty also are contained, not sixty also in
thirty. But not to work from out that which he hath, stands in the
allotment of duties, not in the want of virtues: forasmuch as neither is
he without the good of mercy, who finds not wretched persons such as he
may mercifully assist.
