<span id="iv.i.iv.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—There is a Double Rule for
Understanding the Scriptural Modes of Speech Concerning the Son of God.
These Modes of Speech are of a Threefold Kind.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.ii-p2"></span>2. Wherefore, although we hold most
firmly, concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, what may be called the
canonical rule, as it is both disseminated through the Scriptures, and
has been demonstrated by learned and Catholic handlers of the same
Scriptures, namely, that the Son of God is both under<span
id="page_38">p. 38</span> <span id="iv.i.iv.ii-Page_38"></span>stood to
be equal to the Father according to the form of God in which He is, and
less than the Father according to the form of a servant which He
took; <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) in which form He was found
to be not only less than the Father, but also less than the Holy Spirit;
and not only so, but less even than Himself,—not than Himself who was,
but than Himself who is; because, by taking the form of a servant, He
did not lose the form of God, as the testimonies of the Scriptures
taught us, to which we have referred in the former book: yet there are
some things in the sacred text so put as to leave it ambiguous to which
rule they are rather to be referred; whether to that by which we
understand the Son as less, in that He has taken upon Him the creature,
or to that by which we understand that the Son is not indeed less than,
but equal to the Father, but yet that He is from Him, God of God, Light
of light. For we call the Son God *of* God; but the Father, God only;
not *of* God. Whence it is plain that the Son has another *of* whom He
is, and to whom He is Son; but that the Father has not a Son *of* whom
He is, but only to whom He is father. For every son is what he is, *of*
his father, and is son to his father; but no father is what he is, *of*
his son, but is father to his son. <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.ii-p5"></span>3. Some things, then, are so put in the
Scriptures concerning the Father and the Son, as to intimate the unity
and equality of their substance; as, for instance, “I and the Father are
one;” <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) and, “Who, being in the
form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God;” <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) and whatever other texts there are of
the kind. And some, again, are so put that they show the Son as less on
account of the form of a servant, that is, of His having taken upon Him
the creature of a changeable and human substance; as, for instance, that
which says, “For my Father is greater than I;” <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) and, “The Father judgeth no man, but
hath committed all judgment unto the Son.” For a little after he goes on
to say, “And hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because
He is the Son of man.” And further, some are so put, as to show Him at
that time neither as less nor as equal, but only to intimate that He is
of the Father; as, for instance, that which says, “For as the Father
hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in
Himself;” and that other: “The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what
He seeth the Father do.” <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) For if
we shall take this to be therefore so said, because the Son is less in
the form taken from the creature, it will follow that the Father must
have walked on the water, or opened the eyes with clay and spittle of
some other one born blind, and have done the other things which the Son
appearing in the flesh did among men, before the Son did them; <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) in order that He might be able to do
those things, who said that the Son was not able to do anything of
Himself, except what He hath seen the Father do. Yet who, even though he
were mad, would think this? It remains, therefore, that these texts are
so expressed, because the life of the Son is unchangeable as that of the
Father is, and yet He is of the Father; and the working of the Father
and of the Son is indivisible, and yet so to work is given to the Son
from Him of whom He Himself is, that is, from the Father; and the Son so
sees the Father, as that He is the Son in the very seeing Him. For to be
of the Father, that is, to be born of the Father, is to Him nothing else
than to see the Father; and to see Him working, is nothing else than to
work with Him: but therefore not from Himself, because He is not from
Himself. And, therefore, those things which “He sees the Father do,
these also doeth the Son likewise,” because He is of the Father. For He
neither does other things in like manner, as a painter paints other
pictures, in the same way as he sees others to have been painted by
another man; nor the same things in a different manner, as the body
expresses the same letters, which the mind has thought; but “whatsoever
things,” saith He, “the Father doeth, these same things also doeth the
Son likewise.” <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) He has said both
“these same things,” and “likewise;” and hence the working of both the
Father and the Son is indivisible and equal, but it is from the Father
to the Son. Therefore the Son cannot do anything of Himself, except what
He seeth the Father do. From this rule, then, whereby the Scriptures so
speak as to mean, not to set forth one as less than another, but only to
show which is of which, some have drawn this meaning, as if the Son were
said to be less. And some among ourselves who are more unlearned and
least instructed in these things, <span id="page_39">p. 39</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.ii-Page_39"></span>endeavoring to take these texts according
to the form of a servant, and so misinterpreting them, are troubled. And
to prevent this, the rule in question is to be observed whereby the Son
is not less, but it is simply intimated that He is of the Father, in
which words not His inequality but His birth is declared.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ii-p4"></span> \[Augustin here brings to view both the
trinitarian and the theanthropic or mediatorial subordination. The
former is the status of Sonship. God the Son is God *of* God. Sonship as
a *relation* is subordinate to paternity. But a son must be of the same
grade of being, and of the same nature with his father. A human son and
a human father are alike and equally *human*. And a Divine Son and a
Divine father are alike and equally *divine*. The theanthropic or
mediatorial subordination is the status of humiliation, by reason of the
incarnation. In the words of Augustin, it is “that by which we
understand the Son as less, in that he has taken upon Him the creature.”
The subordination in this case is that of voluntary condescension, for
the purpose of redeeming sinful man.—W.G.T.S.\]
