<span id="v.vii.xxvii-p1"></span> 26. That, namely, befalleth them which
in undisciplined younger widows, the same Apostle saith must be avoided:
“And withal they learn to be idle; and not only idle, but also busy
bodies and full of words, speaking what they ought not.” <span
id="fr_2561"></span>[2562](#fn_2561) This very thing said he concerning
evil women, which we also in evil men do mourn and bewail, who against
him, the very man in whose Epistles we read these things, do, being idle
and full of words, speak what they ought not. And if there be any among
them who did with that purpose come to the holy warfare, <span
id="fr_2562"></span>[2563](#fn_2562) that they may please Him to whom
they have proved themselves, these, when they be so vigorous in strength
of body, and soundness of health, that they are able not only to be
taught, but also, agreeably unto the Apostle, to work, do, by receiving
of these men’s idle and corrupt discourses, which they are unable, by
reason of their unskilled rawness, to judge of, become changed by
pestiferous contagion into the same noisomeness: not only not imitating
the obedience of saints which quietly work, and of other
monasteries <span id="fr_2563"></span>[2564](#fn_2563) which in most
wholesome discipline do live after the apostolic rule; but also
insulting better men than themselves, preaching up laziness as the
keeper of the Gospel, accusing mercy as the prevaricator therefrom. For
a much more merciful work is it to the souls of the weak, to consult for
the fair fame of the servants of God, than it is to the bodies of men,
to break bread to the hungry. Wherefore I would to God that these, which
want to let their hands lie idle, would altogether let their tongues lie
idle too. For they would not make so many willing to imitate them, if
the examples they set were not merely lazy ones, but mute withal.
