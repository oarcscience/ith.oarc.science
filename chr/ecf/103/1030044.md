id="iv.i.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—The Will of God is the Higher
Cause of All Corporeal Change. This is Shown by an Example.</span>

<span id="iv.i.v.iii-p2"></span>7. But there is one kind of natural
order in the conversion and changeableness of bodies, which, although
itself also serves the bidding of God, yet by reason of its unbroken
continuity has ceased to cause wonder; as is the case, for instance,
with those things which are changed either in very short, or at any rate
not long, intervals of time, in heaven, or earth, or sea; whether it be
in rising, or in setting, or in change of appearance from time to time;
while there are other things, which, although arising from that same
order, yet are less familiar on account of longer intervals of time. And
these things, although the many stupidly wonder at them, yet are
understood by those who inquire into this present world, and in the
progress of generations become so much the less wonderful, as they are
the more often repeated and known by more people. Such are the eclipses
of the sun and moon, and some kinds of stars, appearing seldom, and
earthquakes, and unnatural births of living creatures, and other similar
things; of which not one takes place without the will of God; yet, that
it is so, is to most people not apparent. And so the vanity of
philosophers has found license to assign these things also to other
causes, true causes perhaps, but proximate ones, while they are not able
to see at all the cause that is higher than all others, that is, the
will of God; or again to false causes, and to such as are not even put
forward out of any diligent investigation of corporeal things and
motions, but from their own guess and error.

<span id="iv.i.v.iii-p3"></span>8. I will bring forward an example, if I
can, that this may be plainer. There is, we know, in the human body, a
certain bulk of flesh and an outward form, and an arrangement and
distraction of limbs, and a temperament of health; and a soul breathed
into it governs this body, and that soul a rational one; which,
therefore, although changeable, yet can be partaker of that unchangeable
wisdom, so that “it may partake of that which is in and of
itself;” <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361) as <span
id="page_58">p. 58</span> <span id="iv.i.v.iii-Page_58"></span>it is
written in the Psalm concerning all saints, of whom as of living stones
is built that Jerusalem which is the mother of us all, eternal in the
heavens. For so it is sung, “Jerusalem is builded as a city, that is
partaker of that which is in and of itself.” <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362) For “in and of itself,” in that place,
is understood of that chiefest and unchangeable good, which is God, and
of His own wisdom and will. To whom is sung in another place, “Thou
shalt change them, and they shall be changed; but Thou art the
same.” <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363)

<span id="iv.i.v.iii-p4"></span> \[The original is: “*ut sit
participatio ejus in idipsum*.” The English translator renders: “So that
it may partake thereof in itself.” The thought of Augustin is, that the
believing soul though mutable partakes of the immutable; and he
designates the immutable as the *in idipsum:* the self-existent. In that
striking passage in the Confessions, in which he describes the spiritual
and extatic meditations of himself and his mother, as they looked out
upon the Mediterranean from the windows at Ostia—a scene well known from
Ary Schefer’s painting—he denominates God the *idipsum:* the “self same”
(Confessions IX. x). Augustin refers to the same absolute immutability
of God, in this place. By faith, man is “a partaker of a divine nature,”
