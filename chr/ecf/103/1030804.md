<span id="v.ix.ii-p1"></span> 1. Long time, my venerable fellow-bishop
Paulinus, have I been thy Holiness’s debtor for an answer; even since
thou wrotest to me by them of the household <span
id="fr_2707"></span>[2708](#fn_2707.md) of our most religious daughter
Flora, asking of me whether it profit any man after death that his body
is buried at the memorial of some Saint. This, namely, had the said
widow begged of thee for her son deceased in those parts, and thou hadst
written her an answer, consoling her, and announcing to her concerning
the body of the faithful young man Cynegius, that the thing which she
with motherly and pious affection desired was done, to wit, by placing
it in the basilica of most blessed Felix the Confessor. Upon which
occasion it came to pass, that by the same bearers of thy letter thou
didst write also to me, raising the like question, and craving that I
would answer what I thought of this matter, at the same time not
forbearing to say what are thine own sentiments. For thou sayest that to
thy thinking these be no empty motions of religious and faithful minds,
which take this care for their deceased friends. Thou addest, moreover,
that it cannot be void of effect <span
id="fr_2708"></span>[2709](#fn_2708.md) that the whole Church is wont to
supplicate for the departed: so that hence it may be further conjectured
that it doth profit a person after death, if by the faith of his friends
for the interment of his body such a spot be provided wherein may be
apparent the aid, likewise in this way sought, of the Saints.
