id="iv.ii.ciii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 101.—The Will of God, Which is
Always Good, is Sometimes Fulfilled Through the Evil Will of Man.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.ciii-p2"></span>Sometimes, however, a man in the
goodness of his will desires something that God does not desire, even
though God’s will is also good, nay, much more fully and more surely
good (for His will never can be evil): for example, if a good son is
anxious that his father should live, when it is God’s good will that he
should die. Again, it is possible for a man with evil will to desire
what God wills in His goodness: for example, if a bad son wishes his
father to die, when this is also the will of God. It is plain that the
former wishes what God does not wish, and that the latter wishes what
God does wish; and yet the filial love of the former is more in harmony
with the good will of God, though its desire is different from God’s,
than the want of filial <span id="page_270">p. 270</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ciii-Page_270"></span>affection of the latter, though its
desire is the same as God’s. So necessary is it, in determining whether
a man’s desire is one to be approved or disapproved, to consider what it
is proper for man, and what it is proper for God, to desire, and what is
in each case the real motive of the will. For God accomplishes some of
His purposes, which of course are all good, through the evil desires of
wicked men: for example, it was through the wicked designs of the Jews,
working out the good purpose of the Father, that Christ was slain and
this event was so truly good, that when the Apostle Peter expressed his
unwillingness that it should take place, he was designated Satan by Him
who had come to be slain. <span id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291.md) How
good seemed the intentions of the pious believers who were unwilling
that Paul should go up to Jerusalem lest the evils which Agabus had
foretold should there befall him! <span
id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md) And yet it was God’s purpose that
he should suffer these evils for preaching the faith of Christ, and
thereby become a witness for Christ. And this purpose of His, which was
good, God did not fulfill through the good counsels of the Christians,
but through the evil counsels of the Jews; so that those who opposed His
purpose were more truly His servants than those who were the willing
instruments of its accomplishment.
