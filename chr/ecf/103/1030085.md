<span id="iv.i.vii.viii"></span>

<span id="iv.i.vii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.vii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—Whatever is Spoken of God
According to Substance, is Spoken of Each Person Severally, and Together
of the Trinity Itself. One Essence in God, and Three, in Greek,
Hypostases, in Latin, Persons.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vii.viii-p2"></span>9. Wherefore let us hold this above
all, that whatsoever is said of that most eminent and divine loftiness
in respect to itself, is said in respect to substance, but that which is
said in relation to anything, is not said in respect to substance, but
relatively; and that the effect of the same substance in Father and Son
and Holy Spirit is, that whatsoever is said of each in respect to
themselves, is to be taken of them, not in the plural in sum, but in the
singular. For as the Father is God, and the Son is God, and the Holy
Spirit is God, which no one doubts to be said in respect to substance,
yet we do not say that the very Supreme Trinity itself is three Gods,
but one God. So the Father is great, the Son great, and the Holy Spirit
great; yet not three greats, but one great. For it is not written of the
Father alone, as they perversely suppose, but of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit, “Thou art great: Thou art God alone.” <span
id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572.md) And the Father is good, the Son good,
and the Holy Spirit good; yet not three goods, but one good, of whom it
is said, “None is good, save one, that is, God.” For the Lord Jesus,
lest He should be understood as man only by him who said, “Good Master,”
as addressing a man, does not therefore say, There is none good, save
the Father alone; but, “None is good, save one, that is, God.” <span
id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573.md) For the Father by Himself is declared
by the name of Father; but by the name of God, both Himself and the Son
and the Holy Spirit, because the Trinity is one God. But position, and
condition, and places, and times, <span id="page_92">p. 92</span> <span
id="iv.i.vii.viii-Page_92"></span>are not said to be in God properly,
but metaphorically and through similitudes. For He is both said to dwell
between the cherubims, <span id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574.md) which is
spoken in respect to position; and to be covered with the deep as with a
garment, <span id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575.md) which is said in
respect to condition; and “Thy years shall have no end,” <span
id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576.md) which is said in respect of time; and,
“If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there,” <span
id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577.md) which is said in respect to place. And
as respects action (or making), perhaps it may be said most truly of God
alone, for God alone makes and Himself is not made. Nor is He liable to
passions as far as belongs to that substance whereby He is God. So the
Father is omnipotent, the Son omnipotent, and the Holy Spirit is
omnipotent; yet not three omnipotents, but one omnipotent: <span
id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578.md) “For of Him are all things, and
through Him are all things, and in Him are all things; to whom be
glory.” <span id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579.md) Whatever, therefore, is
spoken of God in respect to Himself, is both spoken singly of each
person, that is, of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; and
together of the Trinity itself, not plurally but in the singular. For
inasmuch as to God it is not one thing to be, and another thing to be
great, but to Him it is the same thing to be, as it is to be great;
therefore, as we do not say three essences, so we do not say three
greatnesses, but one essence and one greatness. I say essence, which in
Greek is called <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.vii.viii-p10.3"></span>οὐσία</span>, and which we call more
usually substance.

<span id="iv.i.vii.viii-p11"></span>10. They indeed use also the word
hypostasis; but they intend to put a difference, I know not what,
between <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.vii.viii-p11.1"></span>οὐσία</span> and hypostasis: so that
most of ourselves who treat these things in the Greek language, are
accustomed to say, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.vii.viii-p11.2"></span>μίαν οὐσίαν, τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις</span> or
in Latin, one essence, three substances. <span

<span id="iv.i.vii.viii-p12"></span> \[It is remarkable that Augustin,
understanding thoroughly the distinction between essence and person,
should not have known the difference between <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.vii.viii-p12.1"></span>οὐσία</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.i.vii.viii-p12.2"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.i.vii.viii-p12.3"></span>πόστασις</span>. It
would seem as if his only moderate acquaintance with the Greek language
would have been more than compensated by his profound trinitarian
knowledge.

<span id="iv.i.vii.viii-p13"></span>In respect to the term
“*substantia*”—when it was discriminated from “*essentia*,” as it is
here by Augustin—it corresponds to <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.vii.viii-p13.1"></span>ὑπόστασις</span>, of which it is the
translation. In this case, God is one essence in three substances. But
when “*substantia*” was identified with “*essentia*,” then to say that
God is one essence in three substances would be a self-contradiction.
The identification of the two terms led subsequently to the coinage, in
the mediæval Latin, of the term “*subsistantia*,” to denote <span
class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.vii.viii-p13.2"></span>ὑπόστασις</span>.—W.G.T.S.\]
