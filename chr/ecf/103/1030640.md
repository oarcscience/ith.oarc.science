<span id="v.iv.xxviii-p1"></span> 27. Indeed in all spiritual delights,
which unmarried women enjoy, their holy conversation ought also to be
with caution; lest haply, though their life be not evil through
haughtiness, their report be evil through negligence. Nor are they to be
listened to, whether they be holy men or women, when (upon occasion of
their neglect in some matter being blamed, through which it comes to
pass that they fall into evil suspicion, from which they know that their
life is far removed) they say that it is enough for them their
conscience before God, despising what men think of them, not only
imprudently <span id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291.md) but also cruelly;
when they slay the souls of others; whether of such as blaspheme the way
of God, who following their suspicion are displeased at what is the
chaste life of the Saints, as though it were shameful, or of such also
as make excuse, and imitate, not what they see, but what they think.
Wherefore whosoever guards his life from charges of shameful and evil
deeds, does good to himself; but whosoever guards his character too, is
merciful also towards others. For unto ourselves our own life is
necessary, unto others our character; and certainly even what we
mercifully minister unto others, for their health, abounds also to our
own profit. Whence not in vain the Apostle, “We provide good things,”
saith he, “not only before God, but also before men;” <span
id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292.md) also he saith, “Please ye all men
through all things; even as I also please all men through all things,
not seeking what is of profit unto myself, but what unto many, that they
may be saved.” <span id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293.md) Also in a
certain exhortation he says, “For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things
are true, whatsoever things are holy, whatsoever things are just,
whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are most dear, whatsoever
things are of good report; if any virtue, if any praise, these things
think on, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen
in me.” <span id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294.md) You see how among
many things, unto which by exhortation he admonished them, he neglected
not to set, “whatsoever things are of good report;” and in two words
included all things, where he saith, “if any virtue, if any praise.” For
unto virtue pertain the good things of which He made mention above; but
good report unto praise. I think that the Apostle took not the praise of
men for any great thing, saying in another place, “But to me it is the
least thing, that I be judged of you, or of day of man;” <span
id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295.md) and in another place, “If I were
pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ;” <span
id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296.md) and again, “For our glory is this,
the testimony of our conscience.” <span
id="fr_2297"></span>[2298](#fn_2297.md) But of these two, that is, of a
good life, and a good report, or as is said more shortly, of virtue and
praise, the one for his own sake he most wisely kept, the other for the
sake of others he most mercifully provided. But, forasmuch as human
caution, how great soever, cannot on every side avoid most malevolent
suspicions, when for our good report we shall have done whatever we
rightly can, if any, either by falsely pretending evil things of us, or
from believing evil of us, endeavor to stain our fair fame, let there be
present the solace of conscience, and clearly also the joy, in that our
reward is great in Heaven, even when men say many evil things of
us, <span id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298.md) and we yet live godly and
righteously. For that reward is as the pay of such as serve as soldiers,
through the arms of righteousness, not only on the right hand, but on
the left also; that is to say, through glory and mean estate, through
ill report and good report. <span id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299.md)
