<span id="iv.iv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Of Christ’s Passion, Burial, and
Resurrection.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p2"></span>11. But little \[comparatively\] was the
humiliation (*humilitas*) of our Lord on our behalf in His being born:
it was also added that He deemed it meet to die in behalf of mortal men.
For “He humbled Himself, being made subject even unto death, yea, the
death of the cross:” <span id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570.md) lest any
one of us, even were he able to have no fear of death \[in general\],
should yet shudder at some particular sort of death which men reckon
most shameful. Therefore do we believe in Him <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.iv.vi-p3.3"></span>Who Under Pontius Pilate Was Crucified and
Buried</span>. For it was requisite that the name of the judge should be
added, with a view to the cognizance of the times. Moreover, when that
burial is made an object of belief, there enters also the recollection
of the new tomb, <span id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571.md) which was
meant to present a testimony to Him in His destiny to rise again to
newness of life, even as the Virgin’s womb did the same to Him in His
appointment to be born. For just as in that sepulchre no other dead
person was buried, <span id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572.md) whether
before or after Him; so neither in that womb, whether before or after,
was anything mortal conceived.

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p6"></span>12. We believe also, that <span
class="c19"><span id="iv.iv.vi-p6.1"></span>On the Third Day He Rose
Again from The Dead</span>, the first-begotten for brethren destined to
come after Him, whom He has called into the adoption of the sons of
God, <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md) whom \[also\] He has
deemed it meet to make His own joint-partners and joint-heirs. <span
id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md)
