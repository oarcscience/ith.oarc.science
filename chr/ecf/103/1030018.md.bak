<span id="iv.i.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—By What Rule in the Scriptures
It is Understood that the Son is Now Equal and Now Less.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iii.xi-p2"></span>22. Wherefore, having mastered this
rule for interpreting the Scriptures concerning the Son of God, that we
are to distinguish in them what relates to the form of God, in which He
is equal to the Father, and what to the form of a servant which He took,
in which He is less than the Father; we shall not be disquieted by
apparently contrary and mutually repugnant sayings of the sacred books.
For both the Son and the Holy Spirit, according to the form of God, are
equal to the Father, because neither of them is a creature, as we have
already shown: but according to the form of a servant He is less than
the Father, because He Himself has said, “My Father is greater than
I;” <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) and He is less than Himself,
because it is said of Him, He emptied Himself;” <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) and He is less than the Holy Spirit,
because He Himself says, “Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of
man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy
Ghost, it shall not be forgiven Him.” <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) And in the Spirit too He wrought
miracles, saying: “But if I with the Spirit of God cast out devils, no
doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.” <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) And in Isaiah He says,—in the lesson
which He Himself read in the synagogue, and showed without a scruple of
doubt to be fulfilled concerning Himself,—“The Spirit of the Lord God,”
He says, “is upon me: because He hath anointed me to preach good tidings
unto the meek He hath sent me to proclaim liberty to the
captives,” <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) etc.: for the doing
of which things He therefore declares Himself to be “sent,” because the
Spirit of God is upon Him. According to the form of God, all things were
made by Him; <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) according to the
form of a servant, He was Himself made of a woman, made under the
law. <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) According to the form of
God, He and the Father are one; <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md)
according to the form of a servant, He came not to do His own will, but
the will of Him that sent Him. <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md)
According to the form of God, “As the Father hath life in Himself, so
hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself;” <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) according to the form of a servant,
His “soul is sorrowful even unto death;” and, “O my Father,” He says,
“if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.” <span
id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) According to the form of God, “He is
the True God, and eternal life;” <span id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md)
according to the form of a servant, “He became obedient unto death, even
the death of the cross.” <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) —23.
According to the form of God, all things that the Father hath are
His, <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) and “All mine,” He says,
“are Thine, and Thine are mine;” <span id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md)
according to the form of a servant, the doctrine is not His own, but His
that sent Him. <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md)
