<span id="v.i.xix-p1"></span> 19. For the flesh lusts after nothing save
through the soul, but the flesh is said to lust against the spirit, when
the soul with fleshly lust wrestles against the spirit. This whole are
we: and the flesh itself, which on the departure of the soul dies, the
lowest part of us is not put away as what we are to flee from, but is
laid aside as what we are to receive again, and, after having received
it, never again to leave. But “there is sown an animal body, there shall
rise again a spiritual body.” <span id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869.md)
Then from that time the flesh will not lust after any thing against the
spirit, when as itself also shall be called spiritual, forasmuch as not
only without any opposition, but also without any need of bodily
aliment, <span id="page_387">p. 387</span> <span
id="v.i.xix-Page_387"></span>it shall be for ever made subject unto the
spirit, to be quickened by Christ. Therefore these two things, which are
now opposed the one to the other within us, since we exist in both, let
us pray and endeavor that they may agree. For we ought not to think the
one of them an enemy, but the fault, whereby the flesh lusteth against
the spirit: and this, when healed, will itself cease to exist, and
either substance will be safe, and no strife between either. Let us hear
the Apostle; “I know,” saith he, “that there dwelleth not in me, that
is, in my flesh, any good.” <span id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870.md)
This certainly he saith; that the fault of the flesh, in a good thing,
is not good; and, when this shall have ceased to exist, it will be
flesh, but it will not be now corrupted or faulty <span
id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md) flesh. And yet that this pertains
to our nature the same teacher shows, by saying, first, “I know that
there dwelleth not in me,” in order to expound which, he added, “that
is, in my flesh, any good.” Therefore he saith that his flesh is
himself. It is not then itself that is our enemy: and when its faults
are resisted, itself is loved, because itself is cared for; “For no one
ever hated his own flesh,” <span id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md) as
the Apostle himself saith. And in another place he saith, “So then I
myself with the mind serve the Law of God, but with the flesh the Law of
sin.” Let them hear that have ears. “So then I myself;” I with the mind,
I with the flesh, but “with the mind I serve the Law of God, but with
the flesh the law of sin.” <span id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873.md)
How “with the flesh the law of sin?” was it at all by consenting unto
fleshly lust? Far be it! but by having there motions of desires which he
would not have, and yet had. But, by not consenting to them, with the
mind he served the Law of God, and kept his members from becoming
weapons of sins.
