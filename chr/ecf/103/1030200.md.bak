<span id="iv.i.xvi.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvi.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—What the Wisdom is of Which We
are Here to Treat. Whence the Name of Philosopher Arose. What Has Been
Already Said Concerning the Distinction of Knowledge and Wisdom.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvi.i-p2"></span>1. We must now discourse concerning
wisdom; not the wisdom of God, which without doubt is God, for His
only-begotten Son is called the wisdom of God; <span
id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854.md) but we will speak of the wisdom of
man, yet of true wisdom, which is according to God, and is His true and
chief worship, which is called in Greek by one term, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.i.xvi.i-p3.4"></span>θεοσέβεια</span>. And
this term, as we have already observed, when our own countrymen
themselves also wished to interpret it by a single term, was by them
rendered piety, whereas piety means more commonly what the Greeks call
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.i.xvi.i-p3.5"></span>εὐσέβεια</span>.
But because <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.xvi.i-p3.6"></span>θεοσέβεια</span> cannot be translated
perfectly by any one word, it is better translated by two, so as to
render it rather by “the worship of God.” That this is the wisdom of
man, as we have already laid down in the twelfth book <span
id="fr_855"></span>[856](#fn_855.md) of this work, is shown by the
authority of Holy Scripture, in the book of God’s servant Job, where we
read that the Wisdom of God said to man, “Behold piety, that is wisdom;
and to depart from evil is knowledge;” <span
id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856.md) or, as some have translated the Greek
word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.xvi.i-p5.2"></span>ἐπιστήμην</span>, “learning,” <span
id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857.md) which certainly takes its name from
learning, <span id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858.md) whence also it may be
called knowledge. For everything is learned in order that it may be
known. Although the same word, indeed, <span
id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859.md) is employed in a different sense,
where any one suffers evils for his sins, that he may be corrected.
Whence is that in the Epistle to the Hebrews, “For what son is he to
whom the father giveth not discipline?” And this is still more apparent
in the same epistle: “Now no chastening <span
id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860.md) for the present seemeth to be joyous,
but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.” <span
id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md) Therefore God Himself is the chiefest
wisdom; but the worship of God is the wisdom of man, of which we now
speak. For “the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.” <span
id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md) It is in respect to this wisdom,
therefore, which is the worship of God, that Holy Scripture says, “The
multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world.” <span
id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md)

<span id="iv.i.xvi.i-p13"></span>2. But if to dispute of wisdom belongs
to wise men, what shall we do? Shall we dare indeed to profess wisdom,
lest it should be mere impudence for ourselves to dispute about it?
Shall we not be alarmed by the example of Pythagoras?—who dared not
profess to be a wise man, but answered that he was a philosopher,
*i.e.*, a lover of wisdom; whence arose the name, that became
thenceforth so much the popular name, that no matter how great the
learning wherein any one excelled, either in his own opinion or that of
others, in things pertaining to wisdom, he was still called nothing more
than philosopher. Or was it for this reason that no one, even of <span
id="page_184">p. 184</span> <span id="iv.i.xvi.i-Page_184"></span>such
as these, dared to profess himself a wise man,—because they imagined
that a wise man was one without sin? But our Scriptures do not say this,
which say, “Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.” <span
id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md) For doubtless he who thinks a man
ought to be rebuked, judges him to have sin. However, for my part, I
dare not profess myself a wise man even in this sense; it is enough for
me to assume, what they themselves cannot deny, that to dispute of
wisdom belongs also to the philosopher, *i.e*., the lover of wisdom. For
they have not given over so disputing who have professed to be lovers of
wisdom rather than wise men.

<span id="iv.i.xvi.i-p15"></span>3. In disputing, then, about wisdom,
they have defined it thus: Wisdom is the knowledge of things human and
divine. And hence, in the last book, I have not withheld the admission,
that the cognizance of both subjects, whether divine or human, may be
called both knowledge and wisdom. <span
id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) But according to the distinction made
in the apostle’s words, “To one is given the word of wisdom, to another
the word of knowledge,” <span id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md) this
definition is to be divided, so that the knowledge of things divine
shall be called wisdom, and that of things human appropriate to itself
the name of knowledge; and of the latter I have treated in the
thirteenth book, not indeed so as to attribute to this knowledge
everything whatever that can be known by man about things human, wherein
there is exceeding much of empty vanity and mischievous curiosity, but
only those things by which that most wholesome faith, which leads to
true blessedness, is begotten, nourished, defended, strengthened; and in
this knowledge most of the faithful are not strong, however exceeding
strong in the faith itself. For it is one thing to know only what man
ought to believe in order to attain to a blessed life, which must needs
be an eternal one; but another to know in what way this belief itself
may both help the pious, and be defended against the impious, which last
the apostle seems to call by the special name of knowledge. And when I
was speaking of this knowledge before, my especial business was to
commend faith, first briefly distinguishing things eternal from things
temporal, and there discoursing of things temporal; but while deferring
things eternal to the present book, I showed also that faith respecting
things eternal is itself a thing temporal, and dwells in time in the
hearts of believers, and yet is necessary in order to attain the things
eternal themselves. <span id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) I argued
also, that faith respecting the things temporal which He that is eternal
did and suffered for us as man, which manhood He bare in time and
carried on to things eternal, is profitable also for the obtaining of
things eternal; and that the virtues themselves, whereby in this
temporal and mortal life men live prudently, bravely, temperately, and
justly, are not true virtues, unless they are referred to that same
faith, temporal though it is, which leads on nevertheless to things
eternal.
