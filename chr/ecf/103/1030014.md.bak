<span id="iv.i.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—In What Manner the Son is Less
Than the Father, and Than Himself.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iii.vii-p2"></span>14. In these and like testimonies of
the divine Scriptures, by free use of which, as I have said, our
predecessors exploded such sophistries or errors of the heretics, the
unity and equality of the Trinity are intimated to our faith. But
because, on account of the incarnation of the Word of God for the
working out of our salvation, that the man Christ Jesus might be the
Mediator between God and men, <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) many
things are so said in the sacred books as to signify, or even most
expressly declare, the Father to be greater than the Son; men have erred
through a want of careful examination or consideration of the whole
tenor of the Scriptures, and have endeavored to transfer those things
which are said of Jesus Christ according to the flesh, to that substance
of His which was eternal before the incarnation, and is eternal. They
say, for instance, that the Son is less than the Father, because it is
written that the Lord Himself said, “My Father is greater than I.” <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) But the truth shows that after the same
sense the Son is less also than Himself; for how was He not made less
also than Himself, who “emptied <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md)
Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant?” For He did not so
take the form of a servant as that He should lose the form of God, in
which He was equal to the Father. If, then, the form of a servant was so
taken that the form of God was not lost, since both in the form of a
servant and in the form of God He Himself is the same only-begotten Son
of God the Father, in the form of God equal to the Father, in the form
of a servant the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; is
there any one who cannot perceive that He Himself in the form of God is
also greater than Himself, but yet likewise in the form of a servant
less than Himself? And not, therefore, without cause the Scripture says
both the one and the other, both that the Son is equal to the Father,
and that the Father is greater than the Son. For there is no confusion
when the former is understood as on account of the form of God, and the
latter as on account of the form of a servant. And, in truth, this rule
for clearing the question through all the sacred Scriptures is set forth
in one chapter of an epistle of the Apostle Paul, where this distinction
is commended to us plainly enough. For he says, “Who, being in the form
of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but emptied
Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the
likeness of men: and was found in fashion <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) as a man.” <span
id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) The Son of God, then, is equal to God the
Father in nature, but less in “fashion.” <span
id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) For in the form of a servant which He
took He is less than the Father; but in the form of God, in which also
He was before He took the form of a servant, He is equal to the Father.
In the form of God He is the Word, “by whom all things are made;” <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) but in the form of a servant He was “made
of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the
law.” <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) In like manner, in the form
of God He made man; in the form of a servant He was made man. For if the
Father alone had made man without the Son, it would not have been
written, “Let us make man in *our* image, after *our* likeness.” <span
id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) Therefore, because the form of God took
the form of a servant, both is God and both is man; but both God, on
account of God who takes; and both man, on account of man who is taken.
For neither by that taking is the one of them turned and changed into
the other: the Divinity is not changed into the creature, so as to cease
to be Divinity; nor the creature into Divinity, so as to cease to be
creature.
