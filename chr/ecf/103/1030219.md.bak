<span id="iv.i.xvii-p3"></span>Begins by setting forth briefly and in
sum the contents of the previous fourteen books. The argument is then
shown to have reached so far as to allow of our now inquiring concerning
the Trinity, which is God, in those eternal, incorporeal, and
unchangeable things themselves, in the perfect contemplation of which a
blessed life is promised to us. But this Trinity, as he shows, is here
seen by us as by a mirror and in an enigma, in that it is seen by means
of the image of God, which we are, as in a likeness that is obscure and
hard of discernment. In like manner, it is shown, that some kind of
conjecture and explanation may be gathered respecting the generation of
the divine Word, from the word of our own mind, but only with
difficulty, on account of the exceeding disparity which is discernible
between the two words; and, again, respecting the procession of the Holy
Spirit, from the love that is joined thereto by the will.
