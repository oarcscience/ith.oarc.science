<span id="v.i.xviii-p1"></span> 18. All we therefore, who believe in the
Living and True God, Whose Nature, being in the highest sense good and
incapable of change, neither doth any evil, nor suffers any evil, from
Whom is every good, even that which admits of decrease, and Who admits
not at all of decrease in His own Good, Which is Himself, when we hear
the Apostle saying, “Walk in the Spirit, and perform ye not the lusts of
the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
against the flesh: For these are opposed one to another, that ye do not
what ye would.” <span id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md) Far be it
from us to believe, what the madness of the Manichees believes, that
there are here shown two natures or principles contrary one to another
at strife, the one nature of good, the other of evil. Altogether these
two are both good; both the Spirit is a good, and the flesh a good: and
man, who is composed of both, one ruling, the other obeying, is
assuredly a good, but a good capable of change, which yet could not be
made save by a Good incapable of change, by Whom was created every good,
whether small or great; but how small soever, yet made by What is Great;
and how great soever, yet no way to be compared with the greatness of
the Maker. But in this nature of man, that is good, and well formed and
ordered by One That is Good, there is now war, since there is not yet
health. Let the sickness be healed, there is peace. But that sickness
fault hath deserved, not nature hath had. And this fault indeed through
the laver of regeneration the grace of God hath already remitted unto
the faithful; but under the hands of the same Physician nature as yet
striveth with its sickness. But in such a conflict victory will be
entire soundness; and that, soundness not for a time, but for ever:
wherein not only this sickness is to come to an end, but also none to
arise after it. Wherefore the just man addresseth his soul and saith,
“Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His returns: Who becometh
propitious to all thy iniquities, Who healeth all thy sicknesses.” <span
id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) He becometh propitious to our
iniquities, when He pardons sins: He heals sicknesses when He restrains
evil desires. He becometh propitious unto iniquities by the grant of
forgiveness: He heals sicknesses, by the grant of continence. The one
was done in Baptism to persons confessing; the other is done in the
strife to persons contending; wherein through His help we are to
overcome our disease. Even now the one is done, when we are heard,
saying, “Forgive us our debts;” <span
id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865.md) but the other, when we are heard,
saying, “Lead us not into temptation. For every one is tempted,” saith
the Apostle James, “being drawn away and enticed by his own lust.” <span
id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md) And against this fault there is
sought the help of medicine from Him, Who can heal all such sicknesses,
not by the removal of a nature that is alien from us, but in the renewal
of our own nature. Whence also the above-mentioned Apostle saith not,
“Every one is tempted” by lust, but added, “by his own:” that he who
hears this may understand, how he ought to cry, “I said, Lord, have
mercy upon me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.” <span
id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867.md) For it would not have needed
healing, had it not corrupted <span id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868.md)
itself by sinning, so that its own flesh should lust against it, that
is, itself should be opposed to itself, on that side, wherein in the
flesh it was made sick.
