<span id="v.viii.x-p1"></span> 9. It is indeed a greater fight of
patience, when it is not a visible enemy that by persecution and rage
would urge us into crime which enemy may openly and in broad day be by
not consenting overcome; but the devil himself, (he who doth likewise by
means of the children of infidelity, as by his vessels, persecute the
children of light) doth by himself hiddenly attack us, by his rage
putting us on to do or say something against God. As such had holy Job
experience of him, by both temptations vexed, but in both through
steadfast strength of patience and arms of piety unconquered. For first,
his body being left unhurt, he lost all that he had, in order that the
mind, before excruciation of the flesh, might through withdrawal of the
things which men are wont to prize highly, be broken, and he might say
something against God upon loss of the things for the sake of which he
was thought to worship Him. He was smitten also with sudden bereavement
of all his sons so that whom he had begotten one by one he should lose
all at once, as though their numerousness had been not for the adorning
of his felicity, but for the increasing of his calamity. But where,
having endured these things, he remained immovable in his God, he
cleaved to His will, Whom it was not possible to lose but by his own
will; and in place of the things he had lost he held Him who took them
away, in Whom he should find what should never be lost. For He that took
them away was not that enemy who had will of hurting, but He who had
given to that enemy the power of hurting. The enemy next attacked also
the body, and now not those things which were in the man from without,
but the man himself, in whatever part he could, he smote. From the head
to the feet were burning pains, were crawling worms, were running sores;
still in the rotting body the mind remained entire, and horrid as were
the tortures of the consuming flesh, with inviolate piety and
uncorrupted patience it endured them all. There stood the wife, and
instead of giving her husband any help, was suggesting blasphemy against
God. For we are not to think that the devil, in leaving her when he took
away the sons, went to work as one unskilled in mischief: rather, how
necessary she was to the tempter, he had already learned in Eve. But now
he had not found a second Adam whom he might take by means of a woman.
More cautious was Job in his hours of sadness, than Adam in his bowers
of gladness, the one was overcome in the midst of pleasant things, the
other overcame in the midst of pains; the one consented to that which
seemed delightsome, this other quailed not in torments most
affrightsome. There stood his friends too, not to console him in his
evils, but to suspect evil in him. For while he suffered so great
sorrows, they believed him not innocent, nor did their tongue forbear to
say that which his conscience had not to say; that so amid ruthless
tortures of the body, his mind also might be beaten with truthless
reproaches. But he, bearing in his flesh his own pains, in his heart
others’ errors, reproved his wife for her folly, taught his friends
wisdom, preserved patience in each and all.
