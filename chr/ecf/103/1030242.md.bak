<span id="iv.i.xvii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Augustin Dwells Still
Further on the Disparity Between the Trinity Which is in Man, and the
Trinity Which is God. The Trinity is Now Seen Through a Glass by the
Help of Faith, that It May Hereafter Be More Clearly Seen in the
Promised Sight Face to Face.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xxiii-p2"></span>43. A thing itself, then, which is
a trinity is different from the image of a trinity in some other thing;
by reason of which image, at the same time that also in which these
three things are is called an image; just as both the panel, and the
picture painted on it, are at the same time called an image; but by
reason of the picture painted on it, the panel also is called by the
name of image. But in that Highest Trinity, which is incomparably above
all things, there is so great an indivisibility, that whereas a trinity
of men cannot be called one man, in that, there both is said to be and
is one God, nor is that Trinity in one God, but it is one God. Nor,
again, as that image in the case of man has these three things but is
one person, so is it with the Trinity; but therein are three persons,
the Father of the Son, and the Son of the Father, and the Spirit of both
Father and Son. For although the memory in the case of man, and
especially that memory which beasts have not—*viz*. the memory by which
things intelligible are so contained as that they have not entered that
memory through the bodily senses <span
id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md) —has in this image of the Trinity,
in proportion to its own small measure, a likeness of the Father,
incomparably unequal, yet of some sort, whatever it be: and likewise the
understanding in the case of man, which by the purpose of the thought is
formed thereby, when that which is known is said, and there is a word of
the heart belonging to no tongue, has in its own great disparity some
likeness of the Son; and love in the case of man proceeding from
knowledge, and combining memory and understanding, as though common to
parent and offspring, whereby it is understood to be neither parent nor
offspring, has in that image, some, however exceedingly unequal,
likeness of the Holy Spirit: it is nevertheless not the case, that, as
in that image of the Trinity, these three are not one man, but belong to
one man, so in the Highest Trinity itself, of which this is an image,
these three belong to one God, but they are one God, and these are three
persons, not one. A thing certainly wonderfully ineffable, or ineffably
wonderful, that while this image of the Trinity is one person, but the
Highest Trinity itself is three persons, yet that Trinity of three
persons is more indivisible than this of one. For that \[Trinity\], in
the nature of the Divinity, or perhaps better Deity, is that which it
is, and is mutually and always unchangeably equal: and there was no time
when it was not, or when it was otherwise; and there will be no time
when it will not be, or when it will be otherwise. But these three that
are in the inadequate image, although they are not separate in place,
for they are not bodies, yet are now in this life mutually separate in
magnitude. For that there are therein no several bulks, does not hinder
our seeing that memory is greater than understanding in one man, but the
contrary in another; and that in yet another these two are overpassed by
the greatness of love; and this whether the two themselves are or are
not equal to one another. And so each two by each one, and each one by
each two, and each one by each one: the less are surpassed by the
greater. And when they have been healed of all infirmity, and are
mutually equal, not even then will that thing which by grace will not be
changed, be made equal to that which by nature cannot change, because
the creature cannot be equalled to the Creator, and when it shall be
healed from all infirmity, will be changed.

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xxiii-p4"></span>44. But when the sight shall have
come which is promised anew to us face to face, we <span
id="page_223">p. 223</span> <span
id="iv.i.xvii.xxiii-Page_223"></span>shall see this not only incorporeal
but also absolutely indivisible and truly unchangeable Trinity far more
clearly and certainly than we now see its image which we ourselves are:
and yet they who see through this glass and in this enigma, as it is
permitted in this life to see, are not those who behold in their own
mind the things which we have set in order and pressed upon them; but
those who see this as if an image, so as to be able to refer what they
see, in some way be it what it may, to Him whose image it is, and to see
that also by conjecturing, which they see through the image by
beholding, since they cannot yet see face to face. For the apostle does
not say, We see now a glass, but, We see now through a glass. <span

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xxiii-p3"></span> \[The reader will observe that
Augustin has employed the term “memory” in a wider sense than in the
modern ordinary use. With him, it is the mind as including all that is
potential or latent in it. The innate ideas, in this use, are laid up in
the “memory,” and called into consciousness or “remembered” by
reflection. The idea of God, for example, is not in the “memory” when
not elicited by reflection. The same is true of the ideas of space and
time, etc.—W.G.T.S.\]
