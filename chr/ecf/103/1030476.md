<span id="iv.vii.xii-p1"></span> 12. “Thence He shall come to judge the
quick and dead.” The quick, who shall be alive and remain; the dead, who
shall have gone before. It may also be understood thus: <span
id="page_374">p. 374</span> <span id="iv.vii.xii-Page_374"></span>The
living, the just; the dead, the unjust. For He judges both, rendering
unto each his own. To the just He will say in the judgment, “Come, ye
blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the
beginning of the world.” <span id="fr_1792"></span>[1793](#fn_1792) For
this prepare yourselves, for these things hope, for this live, and so
live, for this believe, for this be baptized, that it may be said to
you, “Come ye blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world.” To them on the left hand, what? “Go
into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.” <span
id="fr_1793"></span>[1794](#fn_1793) Thus will they be judged by Christ,
the quick and the dead. We have spoken of Christ’s first nativity, which
is without time; spoken of the other in the fullness of time, Christ’s
nativity of the Virgin; spoken of the passion of Christ; spoken of the
coming of Christ to judgment. The whole is spoken, that was to be spoken
of Christ, God’s Only Son, our Lord. But not yet is the Trinity perfect.
