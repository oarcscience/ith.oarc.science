<span id="v.iii.xxxix-p1"></span> 38. I send thee not, soul that art
religiously chaste, that hast not given the reins to fleshly appetite
even so far as to allowed marriage, that hast not indulged thy body
about to depart even to the begetting one to succeed thee, that hast
sustained aloft thy earthly members, afloat to accustom them to heaven;
I send thee not, in order that thou mayest learn humility, unto
publicans and sinners, who yet enter into the kingdom of heaven before
the proud: I send thee not to these: for they, who have been set free
from the gulf of uncleanness, are unworthy that undefiled virginity be
sent to them to take pattern from. I send thee unto the King of Heaven,
unto Him, by Whom men were created, and Who was created among men for
the sake of men; unto Him, Who is fair of beauty above the sons of
men, <span id="fr_2134"></span>[2135](#fn_2134.md) and despised by the sons
of men on behalf of the sons of men: unto Him, Who, ruling the immortal
angels, disdained not to do service unto mortals. Him, at any rate, not
unrighteousness, but charity, made humble; “Charity, which rivalleth
not, is not puffed up, seeketh not her own;” <span
id="fr_2135"></span>[2136](#fn_2135.md) forasmuch as “Christ also pleased
not Himself, but, as it is written of Him, The reproaches of such as
reproached Thee have fallen upon Me.” <span
id="fr_2136"></span>[2137](#fn_2136.md) Go then, come unto Him, and learn,
in that He is “meek and lowly of heart.” Thou shall not go unto him, who
dared not by reason of the burden of unrighteousness to lift up his eyes
to heaven, but unto Him, Who by the weight of charity came down from
heaven. <span id="fr_2137"></span>[2138](#fn_2137.md) Thou shalt not go
unto her, who watered with tears the feet of her Lord, seeking
forgiveness of heavy sins; but thou shalt go unto Him, Who, granting
forgiveness of all sins, washed the feet of His own disciples. <span
id="fr_2138"></span>[2139](#fn_2138.md) I know the dignity of thy
virginity; I propose not to thee to imitate the Publican humbly accusing
his own faults; but I fear for the Pharisee proudly boasting of his own
merits. <span id="fr_2139"></span>[2140](#fn_2139.md) I say not, Be thou
such as she, of whom it was said, “There are forgiven unto her many
sins, in that she hath loved much;” <span
id="fr_2140"></span>[2141](#fn_2140.md) but I fear lest, as thinking that
thou hast little forgiven to thee, thou love little.
