<span id="v.ix.xxi-p1"></span> 20. Howbeit it is a question which
surpasses the strength of my understanding, after what manner the
Martyrs aid them who by them, it is certain, are helped; whether
themselves by themselves be present at the same time in so different
places, and by so great distance lying apart one from another, either
where their Memorials are, or beside their Memorials, wheresoever they
are felt to be present: or whether, while they themselves, in a place
congruous with their merits, are removed from all converse with mortals,
and yet do in a general sort pray for the needs of their suppliants,
(like as we pray for the dead, to whom however we are not present, nor
know where they be or what they be doing,) God Almighty, Who is every
where present, neither bounded in <span
id="fr_2760"></span>[2761](#fn_2760.md) with us nor remote from us, hearing
and granting the Martyrs’ prayers, doth by angelic ministries every
where diffused afford to men those solaces, to whom in the misery of
this life He seeth meet to afford the same, and, touching His Martyrs,
doth where He will, when He will, how He will, and chiefest through
their Memorials, because this He knoweth to be expedient for us unto
edifying of the faith of Christ for Whose confession they suffered, by
marvellous and ineffable power and goodness cause their merits to be had
in honor. A matter is this, too high that I should have power to attain
unto it, too abstruse that I should be able to search it out; and
therefore which of these two be the case, or whether perchance both one
and the other be the case, that sometimes these things be done by very
presence of the Martyrs, sometimes by Angels taking upon them the person
of the Martyrs, I dare not define; rather would I seek this at them who
know it. For it is not to be thought that no man knows these things:
(not indeed he who thinks he knows, and knows not,) for there be gifts
of God, Who bestows on these some one, on those some other, according to
the Apostle who says, that “to each one is given the manifestation of
the Spirit to profit withal; to one <span
id="fr_2761"></span>[2762](#fn_2761.md) indeed,” saith he, “is given by the
Spirit discourse of wisdom; to another <span
id="fr_2762"></span>[2763](#fn_2762.md) discourse of science according to
the same Spirit; while to another <span
id="fr_2763"></span>[2764](#fn_2763.md) faith in the same Spirit; to
another <span id="fr_2764"></span>[2765](#fn_2764.md) the gift of healings
in one Spirit; to one <span id="fr_2765"></span>[2766](#fn_2765.md)
workings of miracles; to one <span id="fr_2766"></span>[2767](#fn_2766.md)
prophecy; to one <span id="fr_2767"></span>[2768](#fn_2767.md) discerning
of spirits; to one <span id="fr_2768"></span>[2769](#fn_2768.md) kinds of
tongues; to one <span id="fr_2769"></span>[2770](#fn_2769.md)
interpretation of discourses. But all these worketh one and the same
spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.” <span
id="fr_2770"></span>[2771](#fn_2770.md) Of all these spiritual gifts, which
the Apostle hath rehearsed, to whomsoever is given discerning of
spirits, the same knoweth these things as they are meet to be known.
