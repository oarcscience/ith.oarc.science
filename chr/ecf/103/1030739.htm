But lest any should fancy that this was granted only to the twelve, see also what Luke relateth: &#8220;After these things,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;the Lord chose also other seventy and two, and sent them by two and two before His face into every city and place whither He was about to come. And He said unto them, The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers few: ask ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He would send forth laborers into His harvest. Go your ways: behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves. Carry neither purse nor scrip nor shoes, and salute no man by the way. Into whatsoever house ye shall enter, first say, Peace be to this house. And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: if not, it shall return to you. And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as are with them: for the workman is worthy of his hire.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2493"></A><A HREF="#fn_2493"><FONT SIZE="1">2494</FONT></A>

Otherwise the Apostle did contrary to a command of the Lord: for, after he had shown it to be lawful unto him, he hath straightway subjoined, &#8220;But yet have I not used this power.&#8221;</p>
