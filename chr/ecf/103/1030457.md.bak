<span id="iv.vi.xxxi-p1"></span> 30. Wherefore that heretic, (inasmuch
as our discourse is of those who wish to be called Christians,) I ask
you, what reason he alleges to me? What is there whereby for him to call
me back from believing, as if from rashness? If he bid me believe
nothing; I believe not that this very true religion hath any existence
in human affairs; and what I believe not to exist, I seek not. But He,
as I suppose, will show it to me seeking it: for so it it written, “He
that seeketh shall find.” <span id="fr_1747"></span>[1748](#fn_1747.md)
Therefore I should not come unto him, who forbids me to believe, unless
I believed something. Is there any greater madness, than that I should
displease him by faith alone, which is founded on no knowledge, which
faith alone led me to him?
