<span id="iv.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—That the Great Reason for the
Advent of Christ Was the Commendation of Love.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.v-p2"></span>7. Moreover, what greater reason is
apparent for the advent of the Lord than that God might show His love in
us, commending it powerfully, inasmuch as “while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us”? <span id="fr_1357"></span>[1358](#fn_1357.md) And
furthermore, this is with the intent that, inasmuch as charity is “the
end of the commandment,” <span id="fr_1358"></span>[1359](#fn_1358.md) and
“the fulfilling of the law,” <span id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359.md)
we also may love one another and lay down our life for the brethren,
even as He laid down His life for us. <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[1361](#fn_1360.md) And with regard to God Himself, its
object is that, even if it were an irksome task to love Him, it may now
at least cease to be irksome for us to return His love, seeing that “He
first loved us,” <span id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361.md) and “spared
not His own only Son, but delivered Him up for us all.” <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362.md) For there is no mightier invitation
to love than to anticipate in loving; and that soul is over hard which,
supposing it unwilling indeed to give love, is unwilling also to give
the return of love. But if, even in the case of criminal and sordid
loves, we see how those who desire to be loved in return make it their
special and absorbing business, by such proofs as are within their
power, to render the strength of the love which they themselves bear
plain and patent; if we also perceive how they affect to put forward an
appearance of justice in what they thus offer, such as may qualify them
in some sort to demand that a response be made in all fairness to them
on the part of those souls which they are laboring to beguile; if,
further, their own passion burns more vehemently when they observe that
the minds which they are eager to possess are also moved now by the same
fire: if thus, I say, it happens at once that the soul which before was
torpid is excited so soon as it feels itself to be loved, and that <span
id="page_287">p. 287</span> <span id="iv.iii.v-Page_287"></span>the soul
which was enkindled already becomes the more inflamed so soon as it is
made cognizant of the return of its own love, it is evident that no
greater reason is to be found why love should be either originated or
enlarged, than what appears in the occasion when one who as yet loves
not at all comes to know himself to be the object of love, or when one
who is already a lover either hopes that he may yet be loved in turn, or
has by this time the evidence of a response to his affection. And if
this holds good even in the case of base loves, how much more <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363) in (true.md) friendship? For what else
have we carefully to attend to in this question touching the injuring of
friendship than to this, namely, not to give our friend cause to suppose
either that we do not love him at all, or that we love him less than he
loves us? If, indeed, he is led to entertain this belief, he will be
cooler in that love in which men enjoy the interchange of intimacies one
with another; and if he is not of that weak type of character to which
such an offense to affection will serve as a cause of freezing off from
love altogether, he yet confines himself to that kind of affection in
which he loves, not with the view of enjoyment to himself, but with the
idea of studying the good of others. But again it is worth our while to
notice how,—although superiors also have the wish to be loved by their
inferiors, and are gratified with the zealous attention <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364.md) paid to them by such, and
themselves cherish greater affection towards these inferiors the more
they become cognizant of that,—with what might of love, nevertheless,
the inferior kindles so soon as he learns that he is beloved by his
superior. For there have we love in its more grateful aspect, where it
does not consume itself <span id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365.md) in
the drought of want, but flows forth in the plenteousness of
beneficence. For the former type of love is of misery, the latter of
mercy. <span id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366.md) And furthermore, if
the inferior was despairing even of the possibility of his being loved
by his superior, he will now be inexpressibly moved to love if the
superior has of his own will condescended to show how much he loves this
person who could by no means be bold enough to promise himself so great
a good. But what is there superior to God in the character of Judge? and
what more desperate than man in the character of sinner?—than man, I
ask, who had given himself all the more unreservedly up to the wardship
and domination of proud powers which are unable to make him blessed, as
he had come more absolutely to despair of the possibility of his being
an object of interest to that power which wills not to be exalted in
wickedness, but is exalted in goodness.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p13"></span>8. If, therefore, it was mainly for this
purpose that Christ came, to wit, that man might learn how much God
loves him; and that he might learn this, to the intent that he might be
kindled to the love of Him by whom he was first loved, and might also
love his neighbor at the command and showing of Him who became our
neighbor, in that He loved man when, instead of being a neighbor to Him,
he was sojourning far apart: if, again, all divine Scripture, which was
written aforetime, was written with the view of presignifying the Lord’s
advent; and if whatever has been committed to writing in times
subsequent to these, and established by divine authority, is a record of
Christ, and admonishes us of love, it is manifest that on those two
commandments of love to God and love to our neighbor <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367.md) hang not only all the law and the
prophets, which at the time when the Lord spoke to that effect were as
yet the only Holy Scripture, but also all those books of the divine
literature which have been written <span
id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368.md) at a later period for our health,
and consigned to remembrance. Wherefore, in the Old Testament there is a
veiling of the New, and in the New Testament there is a revealing of the
Old. According to that veiling, carnal men, understanding things in a
carnal fashion, have been under the dominion, both then and now, of a
penal fear. According to this revealing, on the other hand, spiritual
men,—among whom we reckon at once those then who knocked in piety and
found even hidden things opened to them, and others now who seek in no
spirit of pride, lest even things uncovered should be closed to
them,—understanding in a spiritual fashion, have been made free through
the love wherewith they have been gifted. Consequently, inasmuch as
there is nothing more adverse to love than envy, and as pride is the
mother of envy, the same Lord Jesus Christ, God-man, is both a
manifestation of divine love towards us, and an example of human
humility with us, to the end that our great swelling might be cured by a
greater counteracting remedy. For here is great misery, proud man! But
there is greater mercy, a humble God! Take this love, therefore, as the
end that is set before <span id="page_288">p. 288</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v-Page_288"></span>you, to which you are to refer all that
you say, and, whatever you narrate, narrate it in such a manner that he
to whom you are discoursing on hearing may believe, on believing may
hope, on hoping may love.
