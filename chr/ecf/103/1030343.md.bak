<span id="iv.ii.xcv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xcv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 93.—Both the First and the Second
Deaths are the Consequence of Sin. Punishment is Proportioned to
Guilt.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xcv-p2"></span>And neither the first death, which takes
place when the soul is compelled to leave the body, nor the second
death, which takes place when the soul is not permitted to leave the
suffering body, would have been inflicted on man had no one sinned. And,
of course, the mildest punishment of all will fall upon those who have
added no actual sin, to the original sin they brought with them; and as
for the rest who have added such actual sins, the punishment of each
will be the more tolerable in the next world, according as his iniquity
has been less in this world.
