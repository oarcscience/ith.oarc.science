<span id="v.viii.vii-p1"></span> 6. But yet, seeing that for lusts’
sake, or even wickednesses, seeing, in a word, that for this temporal
life and weal men do wonderfully bear the brunt of many horrible
sufferings, they much admonish us how great things ought to be borne for
the sake of a good life, that it may also hereafter be eternal life, and
without any bound of time, without waste or loss of any advantage, in
true felicity secure. The Lord saith, “In your patience ye shall <span

id="v.viii.vii-Page_529"></span>possess your souls:” <span
id="fr_2633"></span>[2634](#fn_2633) He saith not, your farms, your
praises, your luxuries; but, “your souls.” If then the soul endures so
great sufferings that it may possess that whereby it may be lost, how
great ought it to bear that it may not be lost? And then, to mention a
thing not culpable, if it bear so great sufferings for saving of the
flesh under the hands of chirurgeons cutting or burning the same, how
great ought it to bear for saving of itself under the fury of any soever
enemies? Seeing that leeches, that the body may not die, do by pains
consult for the body’s good; but enemies by threatening the body with
pains and death, would urge us on to the slaying of soul and body in
hell.
