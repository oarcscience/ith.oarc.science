<span id="iv.ii.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 52.—In Baptism, Which is the
Similitude of the Death and Resurrection of Christ, All, Both Infants
and Adults, Die to Sin that They May Walk in Newness of Life.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.liv-p2"></span>And after he has said as much about the
condemnation through one man, and the free gift through one man, as he
deemed sufficient for that part of his epistle, the apostle goes on to
speak of the great mystery of holy baptism in the cross of Christ, and
to clearly explain to us that baptism in Christ is nothing else than a
similitude of the death of Christ, and that the death of Christ on the
cross is nothing but a similitude of the pardon of sin: so that just as
real as is His death, so real is the remission of our sins; and just as
real as is His resurrection, so real is our justification. He says:
“What shall we say, then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may
abound?” <span id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175) For he had said
previously, “But where sin, abounded, grace did much more abound.” <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[1177](#fn_1176) And therefore he proposes to
himself the question, whether it would be right to continue in sin for
the sake of the consequent abounding grace. But he answers, “God
forbid;” and adds, “How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer
therein?” Then, to show that we are dead to sin, “Know ye not,” he says,
“that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized
into His death?” If, then, the fact that we were baptized into the death
of Christ proves that we are dead to sin, it follows that even infants
who are baptized into Christ die to sin, being baptized into His death.
For there is no exception made: “So many of us as were baptized into
Jesus Christ, were baptized into His death.” And this is said to prove
that we are dead to sin. Now, to what sin do infants die in their
regeneration but that sin which they bring with them at birth? And
therefore to these also applies what follows: “Therefore we are buried
with Him by baptism into death; that, like as Christ was raised up from
the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of
His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection: knowing
this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might
be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is
dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that
we shall also live with Him: knowing that Christ, being raised from the
dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over Him. For in that
He died, He died unto sin once; but in that He liveth, He liveth unto
God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but
alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Now he had commenced with
proving that we must not continue in sin that grace may abound, and had
said: “How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?” And
to show that we are dead to sin, he added: “Know ye not, that so many of
us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into His death?”
And so he concludes this whole passage just as he began it. For he has
brought in the death of Christ in such a way as to imply that Christ
Himself also died to sin. To what sin did He die if not to the flesh, in
which there was not sin, but the likeness of sin, and which was
therefore called by the name of sin? To those who are baptized into the
death of Christ, then,—and this class includes not adults only, but
infants as well,—he says: “Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead
indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our
Lord.” <span id="fr_1177"></span>[1178](#fn_1177)
