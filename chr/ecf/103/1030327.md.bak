id="iv.ii.lxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 77.—If We Would Give Alms to
Ourselves, We Must Flee Iniquity; For He Who Loveth Iniquity Hateth His
Soul.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxix-p2"></span>Those, then, who think that they can by
giving alms, however profuse, whether in money or in kind, purchase for
themselves the privilege of persisting with impunity in their monstrous
crimes and hideous vices, need not thus deceive themselves. For not only
do they commit these sins, but they love them so much that they would
like to go on forever committing them, if only they could do so with
impunity. Now, he who loveth iniquity hateth his own soul; <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[1248](#fn_1247.md) and he who hateth his own soul is
not merciful but cruel towards it. For in loving it according to the
world, he hateth it according to God. But if he desired to give alms to
it which should make all things clean unto him, he would hate it
according to the world, and love it according to God. Now no one gives
alms unless he receive what he gives from one who is not in want of it.
Therefore it is said, “His mercy shall meet me.” <span
