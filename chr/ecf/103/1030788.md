<span id="v.viii.xiv-p1"></span> 13. But they answer and speak, saying,
“If the will of man without any aid of God by strength of free
choice <span id="fr_2659"></span>[2660](#fn_2659.md) bears so many grievous
and horrible distresses, whether in mind or body, that it may enjoy the
delight of this mortal life and of sins, why may it not be that in the
same manner the self-same will of man by the same strength of
free-choice, not thereunto looking to be aided of God, but unto itself
by natural possibility sufficing, doth, in all of labor or sorrow that
is put upon it, for righteousness and eternal life’s sake most patiently
sustain the same? Or is it so, say they, that the will of the unjust is
sufficient, without aid of God, for them, yea even to exercise
themselves in undergoing torture for iniquity, and before they be
tortured by others; sufficient the will of them which love the respiting
of this life that, without aid of God, they should in the midst of <span

atrocious and protracted torments persevere in a lie, lest confessing
their misdeeds they be ordered to be put to death; and not sufficient
the will of the just, unless strength be put into them from above, that
whatever be their pains, they should, either for beauty’s sake of very
righteousness or for love of eternal life, bear the same?”
