<span id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6. —Why This Opinion is to Be
Rejected.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p2"></span>6. We do not therefore reject this
opinion, because we fear to think of that holy and inviolable and
unchangeable Love, as the spouse of God the Father, existing as it does
from Him, but not as an offspring in order to beget the Word by which
all things are made; but because divine Scripture evidently shows it to
be false. For God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our
likeness;” and a little after it is said, “So God created man in the
image of God.” <span id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md) Certainly, in
that it is of the plural number, the word “our” would not be rightly
used if man were made in the image of one person, whether of the Father,
or of the Son, or of the Holy Spirit; but because he was made in the
image of the Trinity, on that account it is said, “After our image.” But
again, lest we should think that three Gods were to be believed in the
Trinity, whereas the same Trinity is one God, it is said, “So God
created man in the image of God,” instead of saying, “In His own image.”

<span id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p4"></span>7. For such expressions are customary
in the Scriptures; and yet some persons, while maintaining the Catholic
faith, do not carefully attend to them, in such wise that they think the
words, “God made man in the image of God,” to mean that the Father made
man after the image of the Son; and they thus desire to assert that the
Son also is called God in the divine Scriptures, as if there were not
other most true and clear proofs wherein the Son is called not only God,
but also the true God. For whilst they aim at explaining another
difficulty in this text, they become so entangled that they cannot
extricate themselves. For if the Father made man after the image of the
Son, so that he is not the image of the Father, but of the Son, then the
Son is unlike the Father. But if a pious faith teaches us, as it does,
that the Son is like the Father after an equality of essence, then that
which is made in the likeness of the Son must needs also be made in the
likeness of the Father. Further, if the Father made man not in His own
image, but in the image of His Son, why does He not say, “Let us make
man after Thy image and likeness,” whereas He does say, “our;” unless it
be because the image of the Trinity was made in man, that in this way
man should be the image of the one true God, because the Trinity itself
is the one true God? Such expressions are innumerable in the Scriptures,
but it will suffice to have produced these. It is so said in the Psalms,
“Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; Thy blessing is upon Thy
people;” <span id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md) as if the words were
spoken to some one else, not to Him of whom it had been said, “Salvation
belongeth unto the Lord.” And again, “For by Thee,” he says, “I shall be
delivered from temptation, and by hoping in my God I shall leap over the
wall;” <span id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750.md) as if he said to some one
else, “By Thee I shall be delivered from temptation.” And again, “In the
heart of the king’s enemies; whereby the people fall under Thee;” <span
id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md) as if he were to say, in the heart of
Thy enemies. For he had said to that King, that is, to our Lord Jesus
Christ, “The people fall under Thee,” whom he intended by the word King,
when he said, “In the heart of the king’s enemies.” Things of this kind
are found more rarely in the New Testament. But yet the apostle says to
the Romans, “Concerning His Son who was made to Him of the seed of David
according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with power,
according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of the dead of
Jesus Christ our Lord;” <span id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752.md) as
though he were speaking above of some one <span id="page_158">p.
158</span> <span id="iv.i.xiv.vi-Page_158"></span>else. For what is
meant by the Son of God declared by the resurrection of the dead of
Jesus Christ, except of the same Jesus Christ who was declared to be Son
of God with power? And as then in this passage, when we are told, “the
Son of God with power of Jesus Christ,” or “the Son of God according to
the spirit of holiness of Jesus Christ,” or “the Son of God by the
resurrection of the dead of Jesus Christ,” whereas it might have been
expressed in the ordinary way, In His own power, or according to the
spirit of His own holiness, or by the resurrection of His dead, or of
their dead: as, I say, we are not compelled to understand another
person, but one and the same, that is, the person of the Son of God our
Lord Jesus Christ; so, when we are told that “God made man in the image
of God,” although it might have been more usual to say, after His own
image, yet we are not compelled to understand any other person in the
Trinity, but the one and selfsame Trinity itself, who is one God, and
after whose image man is made.

<span id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p9"></span>8. And since the case stands thus, if
we are to accept the same image of the Trinity, as not in one, but in
three human beings, father and mother and son, then the man was not made
after the image of God before a wife was made for him, and before they
procreated a son; because there was not yet a trinity. Will any one say
there was already a trinity, because, although not yet in their proper
form, yet in their original nature, both the woman was already in the
side of the man, and the son in the loins of his father? Why then, when
Scripture had said, “God made man after the image of God,” did it go on
to say, “God created him; male and female created He them: and God
blessed them”? <span id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753.md) (Or if it is to
be so divided, “And God created man,” so that thereupon is to be added,
“in the image of God created He him,” and then subjoined in the third
place, “male and female created He them;” for some have feared to say,
He made him male and female, lest something monstrous, as it were,
should be understood, as are those whom they call hermaphrodites,
although even so both might be understood not falsely in the singular
number, on account of that which is said, “Two in one flesh.”) Why then,
as I began by saying, in regard to the nature of man made after the
image of God, does Scripture specify nothing except male and female?
Certainly, in order to complete the image of the Trinity, it ought to
have added also son, although still placed in the loins of his father,
as the woman was in his side. Or was it perhaps that the woman also had
been already made, and that Scripture had combined in a short and
comprehensive statement, that of which it was going to explain
afterwards more carefully, how it was done; and that therefore a son
could not be mentioned, because no son was yet born? As if the Holy
Spirit could not have comprehended this, too, in that brief statement,
while about to narrate the birth of the son afterwards in its own place;
as it narrated afterwards in its own place, that the woman was taken
from the side of the man, <span id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754.md) and
yet has not omitted here to name her.
