<span id="iv.vi.i-p1"></span> *Retract*. i. cap. 14. Moreover now at
Hippo-Regius as Presbyter I wrote a book *on the Profit of Believing*,
to a friend of mine who had been taken in by the Manichees, and whom I
knew to be still held in that error, and to deride the Catholic school
of Faith, in that men were bid believe, but not taught what was truth by
a most certain method. In this book I said, &c. \* \* \*. This book
begins thus, *“Si mihi Honorate, unum atque idem videretur esse.”*

<span id="iv.vi.i-p2"></span>St. Augustin enumerates his book *on the*
*Profit of Believing* first amongst those he wrote as Presbyter, to
which order he was raised at Hippo about the beginning of the year 391.
The person for whom he wrote had been led into error by himself, and
appears to have been recovered from it, at least if he is the same who
wrote to St. Augustin from Carthage about 412, proposing several
questions, and to whom St. Augustin wrote his 140th Epistle. Cassiodorus
calls him a Presbyter, though at that time he was not baptized. In Ep.
83<span id="iv.vi.i-p2.1"></span>, St. Augustin speaks of the death of
another Honoratus, a Presbyter. Towards the end of his life he also
wrote his 228th Epistle to a Bishop of Thabenna of the same
name.—(*Bened. Ed.*)

<span id="iv.vi.i-p3"></span>The remarks in the *Retractations* are
given in notes to the passages where they occur.
