<span id="v.iv.xxx-p1"></span> 29. Next I entreat you, by Him, from Whom
ye have both received this gift, and hope for the rewards of this gift,
that ye be mindful to set me also in your prayers with all your
household Church. Forsooth it hath come to pass in most proper order,
that I should write unto your Mother now aged a letter <span
id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301) concerning prayer; unto her,
forsooth, it chiefly pertains by praying to contend on your behalf, who
is less full of care for herself than for you; and that for you rather
than for her I should compose this little work concerning widowed
continence; because unto you it remaineth to overcome, what her age hath
already overcome. But the holy virgin your child, if she desire aught
concerning her profession from our labors, she hath a large book on Holy
Virginity to read. Concerning the reading of which I had also admonished
you, forasmuch as it contains many things necessary unto either
chastity, that is, virginal and widowed, which things on this account I
have here partly touched on lightly, partly altogether passed over,
because I there discussed them more fully.

<span id="v.iv.xxx-p3"></span> May you persevere in the grace of Christ.
