<span id="v.vii.vii-p1"></span> 6. Which thing whoso thinks cannot have
been done by the Apostles, that with them women of holy conversation
should go about wheresoever they preached the Gospel, that of their
substance they might minister to their necessities, let him hear the
Gospel, and learn how in this they did after the example of the Lord
Himself. Our Lord, namely, according to the wont of His pity,
sympathizing with the weak, albeit Angels might minister unto Him, had
both a bag in which should be put the money which was bestowed doubtless
by good and believing persons, as necessary for their living, (which bag
He gave in charge to Judas, that even thieves, if we could not keep
clear of such, we might learn to tolerate in the Church. He, namely, as
is written of him, “stole <span id="fr_2488"></span>[2489](#fn_2488.md)
what was put therein:”) and He willed that women should follow Him for
the preparing and ministering what was necessary, showing what was due
to evangelists and ministers of God as soldiers, from the people of God
as the provincials; so that if any should not choose to use that which
is due unto him, as Paul the Apostle did not choose, he might bestow the
more upon the Church, by not exacting the pay which was due to him, but
by earning his daily living of his own labors. For it had been said to
the inn-keeper to whom that wounded man was brought, “Whatever thou
layest out more, at my coming again I will repay thee.” <span
id="fr_2489"></span>[2490](#fn_2489.md) The Apostle Paul, then, did “lay
out more,” <span id="fr_2490"></span>[2491](#fn_2490.md) in that he, as
himself witnesseth, did at his own charges go a warfare. In the Gospel,
namely, it is written, “Thereafter also Himself was making a journey
through cities and villages preaching and evangelizing of the kingdom of
God; and the twelve with Him, and certain women which had been healed of
evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who is called Magdalene, out of whom
seven devils had gone forth, and Joanna wife of Chuza Herod’s steward,
and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto Him of their
substance.” <span id="fr_2491"></span>[2492](#fn_2491.md) This example of
the Lord the Apostles did imitate, to receive the meat which was due
unto them; of which the same Lord most openly speaketh: “As ye go,”
saith He, “preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the
sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out devils. Freely have ye
received, freely give. Possess not gold nor silver nor money in your
purses, neither scrip on your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes,
neither staff: for the workman is worthy of his meat.” <span
id="fr_2492"></span>[2493](#fn_2492.md) Lo, where the Lord appointeth the
very thing which the Apostle doth mention. For to this end He told them
not to carry all those things, namely, that where need should be, they
might receive them of them unto whom they preached the kingdom of God.
