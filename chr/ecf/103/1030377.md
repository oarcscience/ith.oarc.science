<span id="iv.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—Of the Full Narration to Be
Employed in Catechising.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p2"></span>5. The narration is full when each person
is catechised in the first instance from what is written in the text,
“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,” <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342.md) on to the present times of the
Church. This does not imply, however, either that we ought to repeat by
memory the entire Pentateuch, and the entire Books of Judges, and Kings,
and Esdras, <span id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343.md) and the entire
Gospel and Acts of the Apostles, if we have learned all these word for
word; or that we should put all the matters which are contained in these
volumes into our own words, and in that manner unfold and expound them
as a whole. For neither does the time admit of that, nor does any
necessity demand it. But what we ought to do is, to give a comprehensive
statement of all things, summarily and generally, so that certain of the
more wonderful facts may be selected which are listened to with superior
gratification, and which have been ranked so remarkably among the exact
turning-points (of the history); <span
id="fr_1344"></span>[1345](#fn_1344.md) that, instead of exhibiting them to
view only in their wrappings, if we may so speak, and then instantly
snatching them from our sight, we ought to dwell on them for a certain
space, and thus, as it were, unfold them and open them out to vision,
and present them to the minds of the hearers as things to be examined
and admired. But as for all other details, these should be passed over
rapidly, and thus far introduced and woven into the narrative. The
effect of pursuing this plan is, that the particular facts which we wish
to see specially commended to attention obtain greater prominence in
consequence of the others being made to yield to them; while, at the
same time, neither does the learner, whose interest we are anxious to
stimulate by our statement, come to these subjects with a mind already
exhausted, nor is confusion induced upon the memory of the person whom
we ought to be instructing by our teaching.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p6"></span>6. In all things, indeed, not only ought
our own eye to be kept fixed upon the end of the commandment, which is
“charity, out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith
unfeigned,” <span id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345.md) to which we
should make all that we utter refer; but in like manner ought the gaze
of the person whom we are instructing by our utterance to be moved <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346.md) toward the same, and guided in that
direction. And, in truth, for no other reason were all those things
which we read in the Holy Scriptures written, previous to the Lord’s
advent, but for this,—namely, that His advent might be pressed upon the
attention, and that the <span id="page_286">p. 286</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iv-Page_286"></span>Church which was to be, should be
intimated beforehand, that is to say, the people of God throughout all
nations; which Church is His body, wherewith also are united and
numbered all the saints who lived in this world, even before His advent,
and who believed then in His future coming, just as we believe in His
past coming. For (to use an illustration) Jacob, at the time when he was
being born, first put forth from the womb a hand, with which also he
held the foot of the brother who was taking priority of him in the act
of birth; and next indeed the head followed, and thereafter, at last,
and as matter of course, the rest of the members: <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347.md) while, nevertheless the head in
point of dignity and power has precedence, not only of those members
which followed it then, but also of the very hand which anticipated it
in the process of the birth, and is really the first, although not in
the matter of the time of appearing, at least in the order of nature.
And in an analogous manner, the Lord Jesus Christ, previous to His
appearing in the flesh, and coming forth in a certain manner out of the
womb of His secrecy, before the eyes of men as Man, the Mediator between
God and men, <span id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md) “who is over
all, God blessed for ever,” <span id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349.md)
sent before Him, in the person of the holy patriarchs and prophets, a
certain portion of His body, wherewith, as by a hand, He gave token
beforetime of His own approaching birth, and also supplanted <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350.md) the people who were prior to Him in
their pride, using for that purpose the bonds of the law, as if they
were His five fingers. For through five epochs of times <span
id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351.md) there was no cessation in the
foretelling and prophesying of His own destined coming; and in a manner
consonant with this, he through whom the law was given wrote five books;
and proud men, who were carnally minded, and sought to “establish their
own righteousness,” <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352.md) were not
filled with blessing by the open hand of Christ, but were debarred from
such good by the hand compressed and closed; and therefore their feet
were tied, and “they fell, while we are risen, and stand upright.” <span
id="fr_1353"></span>[1354](#fn_1353.md) But although, as I have said, the
Lord Christ did thus send before Him a certain portion of His body, in
the person of those holy men who came before Him as regards the time of
birth, nevertheless He is Himself the Head of the body, the
Church, <span id="fr_1354"></span>[1355](#fn_1354.md) and all these have
been attached to that same body of which He is the head, in virtue of
their believing in Him whom they announced prophetically. For they were
not sundered (from that body) in consequence of fulfilling their course
before Him, but rather were they made one with the same by reason of
their obedience. For although the hand may be put forward away before
the head, still it has its connection beneath the head. Wherefore all
things which were written aforetime were written in order that we might
be taught thereby, <span id="fr_1355"></span>[1356](#fn_1355.md) and were
our figures, and happened in a figure in the case of these men. Moreover
they were written for our sakes, upon whom the end of the ages has
come. <span id="fr_1356"></span>[1357](#fn_1356.md)
