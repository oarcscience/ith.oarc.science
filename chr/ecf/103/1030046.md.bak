<span id="iv.i.v.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.v.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—God Uses All Creatures as He Will,
and Makes Visible Things for the Manifestation of Himself.</span>

<span id="iv.i.v.v-p2"></span>9. What, then, we have alleged by way of
example of a single wise man, although of one still bearing a mortal
body and still seeing only in part, may be allowably extended also to a
family, where there is a society of such men, or to a city, or even to
the whole world, if the chief rule and government of human affairs were
in the hands of the wise, and of those who were piously and perfectly
subject to God; but because this is not the case as yet (for it behoves
us first to be exercised in this our pilgrimage after mortal fashion,
and to be taught with stripes by force of gentleness and patience), let
us turn our thoughts to that country itself that is above and heavenly,
from which we here are pilgrims. For there the will of God, “who maketh
His angels spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire,” <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) presiding among spirits which are
joined in perfect peace and friendship, and combined in one will by a
kind of spiritual fire of charity, as it were in an elevated and holy
and secret seat, as in its own house and in its own temple, thence
diffuses itself through all things by certain most per<span
id="page_59">p. 59</span> <span id="iv.i.v.v-Page_59"></span>fectly
ordered movements of the creature; first spiritual, then corporeal; and
uses all according to the unchangeable pleasure of its own purpose,
whether incorporeal things or things corporeal, whether rational or
irrational spirits, whether good by His grace or evil through their own
will. But as the more gross and inferior bodies are governed in due
order by the more subtle and powerful ones, so all bodies are governed
by the living spirit; and the living spirit devoid of reason, by the
reasonable living spirit; and the reasonable living spirit that makes
default and sins, by the living and reasonable spirit that is pious and
just; and that by God Himself, and so the universal creature by its
Creator, from whom and through whom and in whom it is also created and
established. <span id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md) And so it comes to
pass that the will of God is the first and the highest cause of all
corporeal appearances and motions. For nothing is done visibly or
sensibly, unless either by command or permission from the interior
palace, invisible and intelligible, of the supreme Governor, according
to the unspeakable justice of rewards and punishments, of favor and
retribution, in that far-reaching and boundless commonwealth of the
whole creature.

<span id="iv.i.v.v-p5"></span>10. If, therefore, the Apostle Paul,
although he still bare the burden of the body, which is subject to
corruption and presseth down the soul, <span
id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) and although he still saw only in part
and in an enigma, <span id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md) wishing to
depart and be with Christ, <span id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) and
groaning within himself, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the
redemption of his body, <span id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md) yet was
able to preach the Lord Jesus Christ significantly, in one way by his
tongue, in another by epistle, in another by the sacrament of His body
and blood (since, certainly, we do not call either the tongue of the
apostle, or the parchments, or the ink, or the significant sounds which
his tongue uttered, or the alphabetical signs written on skins, the body
and blood of Christ; but that only which we take of the fruits of the
earth and consecrate by mystic prayer, and then receive duly to our
spiritual health in memory of the passion of our Lord for us: and this,
although it is brought by the hands of men to that visible form, yet is
not sanctified to become so great a sacrament, except by the spirit of
God working invisibly; since God works everything that is done in that
work through corporeal movements, by setting in motion primarily the
invisible things of His servants, whether the souls of men, or the
services of hidden spirits subject to Himself): what wonder if also in
the creature of heaven and earth, of sea and air, God works the sensible
and visible things which He wills, in order to signify and manifest
Himself in them, as He Himself knows it to be fitting, without any
appearing of His very substance itself, whereby He is, which is
altogether unchangeable, and more inwardly and secretly exalted than all
spirits whom He has created?
