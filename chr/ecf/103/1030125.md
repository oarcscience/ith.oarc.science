<span id="iv.i.xi.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xi.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—In What Way We Must Inquire
Concerning the Trinity.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xi.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.xi.i-p2.1"></span>We</span> certainly seek a trinity,—not any
trinity, but that Trinity which is God, and the true and supreme and
only God. Let my hearers then wait, for we are still seeking. And no one
justly finds fault with such a search, if at least he who seeks that
which either to know or to utter is most difficult, is steadfast in the
faith. But whosoever either sees or teaches better, finds fault quickly
and justly with any one who confidently affirms concerning it. “Seek
God,” he says, “and your heart shall live;” <span
id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695) and lest any one should rashly rejoice
that he has, as it were, apprehended it, “Seek,” he says, “His face
evermore.” <span id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696) And the apostle: “If
any man,” he says, “think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing
yet as he ought to know. But if any man love God, the same is known of
Him.” <span id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697) He has not said, has known
Him, which is dangerous presumption, but “is known of Him.” So also in
another place, when he had said, “But now after that ye have known God:”
immediately correcting himself, he says, “or rather are known of
God.” <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698) And above all in that
other place, “Brethren,” he says, “I count not myself to have
apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are
behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press
in purpose <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699) toward the mark, for
the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore,
as many as be perfect, be thus minded.” <span
id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700) Perfection in this life, he tells us,
is nothing else than to forget those things which are behind, and to
reach forth and press in purpose toward those things which are before.
For he that seeks has the safest purpose, \[who seeks\] until that is
taken hold of whither we are tending, and for which we are reaching
forth. But that is the right purpose which starts from faith. For a
certain faith is in some way the starting-point of knowledge; but a
certain knowledge will not be made perfect, except after this life, when
we shall see face to face. <span id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701) Let
us therefore be thus minded, so as to know that the disposition to seek
the truth is more safe than that which presumes things unknown to be
known. Let us therefore so seek as if we should find, and so find as if
we were about to seek. For “when a man hath done, then he
beginneth.” <span id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702) Let us doubt without
unbelief of things to be believed; let us affirm without rashness of
things to be understood: authority must be held fast in the former,
truth sought out in the latter. As regards this question, then, let us
believe that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit is one God,
the Creator and Ruler of the whole creature; and that the Father is not
the Son, nor the Holy Spirit either the Father or the Son, but a trinity
of persons mutually interrelated, and a unity of an equal essence. And
let us seek to understand this, praying for help from Himself, whom we
wish to understand; and as much as He grants, desiring to explain what
we understand with so much pious care and anxiety, that even if in any
case we say one thing for another, we may at least say nothing unworthy.
As, for the sake of example, if we say anything concerning the Father
that does not properly belong to the Father, or does belong to the Son,
or to the <span id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span
id="iv.i.xi.i-Page_126"></span>Holy Spirit, or to the Trinity itself;
and if anything of the Son which does not properly suit with the Son, or
at all events which does suit with the Father, or with the Holy Spirit,
or with the Trinity; or if, again, anything concerning the Holy Spirit,
which is not fitly a property of the Holy Spirit, yet is not alien from
the Father, or from the Son, or from the one God the Trinity itself.
Even as now our wish is to see whether the Holy Spirit is properly that
love which is most excellent which if He is not, either the Father is
love, or the Son, or the Trinity itself; since we cannot withstand the
most certain faith and weighty authority of Scripture, saying, “God is
love.” <span id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703) And yet we ought not to
deviate into profane error, so as to say anything of the Trinity which
does not suit the Creator, but rather the creature, or which is feigned
outright by mere empty thought.
