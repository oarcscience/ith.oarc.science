id="iv.i.xiv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—Man Alone of Animate Creatures
Perceives the Eternal Reasons of Things Pertaining to the Body.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xiv.ii-p2"></span>2. And the beasts, too, are able both
to perceive things corporeal from without, through the senses of the
body, and to fix them in the memory, and remember them, and in them to
seek after things suitable, and shun things inconvenient. But to note
these things, and to retain them not only as caught up naturally but
also as deliberately committed to memory, and to imprint them again by
recollection and conception when now just slipping away into
forgetfulness; in order that as conception is formed from that which the
memory contains, so also the contents themselves of the memory may be
fixed firmly by thought: to combine again imaginary objects of sight, by
taking this or that of what the memory remembers, and, as it were,
tacking them to one another: to examine after what manner it is that in
this kind things like the true are to be distinguished from the true,
and this not in things spiritual, but in corporeal things
themselves;—these acts, and the like, although performed in reference to
things sensible, and those which the mind has deduced through the bodily
senses, yet, as they are combined with reason, so are not common to men
and beasts. But it is the part of the higher reason to judge of these
corporeal things according to incorporeal and eternal reasons; which,
unless they were above the human mind, would certainly not be
unchangeable; and yet, unless something of our own were subjoined to
them, we should not be able to employ them as our measures by which to
judge of corporeal things. But we judge of corporeal things from the
rule of dimensions and figures, which the mind knows to remain
unchangeably. <span id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md)

<span id="iv.i.xiv.ii-p3"></span> \[The distinction drawn here is
between that low form of intelligence which exists in the brute, and
that high form characteristic of man. In the Kantian nomenclature, the
brute has understanding, but unenlightened by reason; either theoretical
or practical. He has intelligence, but not as modified by the forms of
space and time and the categories of quantity, quality, relation etc.;
and still less as modified and exalted by the ideas of reason—namely,
the mathematical ideas, and the moral ideas of God, freedom, and
immortality. The animal has no *rational* intelligence. He has mere
understanding without reason.—W.G.T.S.\]
