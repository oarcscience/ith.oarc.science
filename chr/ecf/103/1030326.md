<span id="iv.ii.lxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 76.—To Give Alms Aright, We
Should Begin with Ourselves, and Have Pity Upon Our Own Souls.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxviii-p2"></span>For the man who wishes to give aims
as he ought, should begin with himself, and give to himself first. For
almsgiving is a work of mercy; and most truly is it said, “To have mercy
on thy soul is pleasing to God.” <span
id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240.md) And for this end are we born again,
that we should be pleasing to God, who is justly displeased with that
which we brought with us when we were born. This is our first alms,
which we give to ourselves when, through the mercy of a pitying God, we
find that we are ourselves wretched, and confess the justice of His
judgment by which we are made wretched, of which the apostle says, “The
judgment was by one to condemnation;” <span
id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241.md) and praise the greatness of His
love, of which the same preacher of grace says, “God commendeth His love
toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for
us:” <span id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242.md) and thus judging truly
of our own misery, and loving God with the love which He has Himself
bestowed, we lead a holy and virtuous life. But the Pharisees, while
they gave as alms the tithe of all their fruits, even the most
insignificant, passed over judgment and the love of God, and so did not
commence their alms-giving at home, and extend their pity to themselves
in the first instance. And it is in reference to this order of love that
it is said, “Love thy neighbor as thyself.” <span
id="fr_1243"></span>[1244](#fn_1243.md) When, then, our Lord had rebuked
them because they made themselves clean on the outside, but within were
full of ravening and wickedness, He advised them, in the exercise of
that charity which each man owes to himself in the first instance, to
make clean the inward parts. “But rather,” He says, “give alms of such
things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.” <span
id="fr_1244"></span>[1245](#fn_1244.md) Then, to show what it was that He
advised, and what they took no pains to do, and to show that He did not
overlook or forget their almsgiving, “But woe unto you,
Pharisees!” <span id="fr_1245"></span>[1246](#fn_1245.md) He says; as if He
meant to say: I indeed advise you to give alms which shall make all
things clean unto you; “but woe unto you! for ye tithe mint, and rue,
and all manner of herbs;” as if He meant to say: I know these alms of
yours, and ye need not think that I am now admonishing you in respect of
such things; “and pass over judgment and the love of God,” an alms by
which ye might have been made clean from all inward impurity, so that
even the bodies which ye are now washing would have been clean to you.
For this is the import of “all things,” both inward and outward things,
as we read in another place: “Cleanse first that which is within, that
the outside may be clean also.” <span
id="fr_1246"></span>[1247](#fn_1246.md) But lest He might appear to despise
the alms which they were giving out of the fruits of the earth, He says:
“These ought ye to have done,” referring to judgment and the love of
God, “and not to leave the other undone,” referring to the giving of the
tithes.
