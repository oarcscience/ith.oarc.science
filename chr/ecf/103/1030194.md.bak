<span id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—The Remains of Death and the
Evil Things of the World Turn to Good for the Elect. How Fitly the Death
of Christ Was Chosen, that We Might Be Justified in His Blood. What the
Anger of God is.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p2"></span>20. For although the death, too, of the
flesh itself came originally from the sin of the first man, yet the good
use of it has made most glorious martyrs. And so not only that death
itself, bat all the evils of this world, and the griefs and labors of
men, although they come from the deserts of sins, and especially of
original sin, whence life itself too became bound by the bond of death,
yet have fitly remained, even when sin is forgiven; that man might have
wherewith to contend for truth, and whereby the goodness of the faithful
might be exercised; in order that the new man through the new covenant
might be made ready among the evils of this world for a new world, by
bearing wisely the misery which this condemned life deserved, and by
rejoicing soberly because it will be finished, but expecting faithfully
and patiently the blessedness which the future life, being set free,
will have for ever. For the devil being cast forth from his dominion,
and from the hearts of the faithful, in the condemnation and
faithlessness of whom he, although himself also condemned, yet reigned,
is only so far permitted to be an adversary according to the condition
of this mortality, as God knows to be expedient for them: concerning
which the sacred writings speak through the mouth of the apostle: “God
is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are
able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye
may be able to bear it.” <span id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833.md) And
those evils which the faithful endure piously, are of profit either for
the correction of sins, or for the exercising and proving of
righteousness, or to manifest the misery of this life, that the life
where will be that true and perpetual blessedness may be desired more
ardently, and sought out more earnestly. But it is on their account that
these evils are still kept in being, of whom the apostle says: “For we
know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to
them who are called to be holy according to His purpose. For whom He did
foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His
Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom
He did predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He
also justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified.” It is of
these who are predestinated, that not one shall perish with the devil;
not one shall remain even to death under the power of the devil. And
then follows what I have already cited above: <span
id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md) “What shall we then say to these
things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His
own Son, but delivered Him up for us all; how has He not with Him also
freely given us all things?” <span id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md)

<span id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p6"></span>21. Why then should the death of Christ
not have come to pass? Nay, rather, why should not that death itself
have been chosen above all else to be brought to pass, to the passing by
of the other innumerable ways which He who is omnipotent could have
employed to free us; that death, I say, wherein neither was anything
diminished or changed from His divinity, and so great benefit was
conferred upon men, from the humanity which He took upon Him, that a
temporal death, which was not due, was rendered by the eternal Son of
God, who was also the Son of man, whereby He might free them from an
eternal <span id="page_179">p. 179</span> <span
id="iv.i.xv.xvi-Page_179"></span>death which was due? The devil was
holding fast our sins, and through them was fixing us deservedly in
death. He discharged them, who had none of His own, and who was led by
him to death undeservedly. That blood was of such price, that he who
even slew Christ for a time by a death which was not due, can as his due
detain no one, who has put on Christ, in the eternal death which was
due. Therefore “God commendeth His love towards us, in that, while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now
justified in His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.”
Justified, he says, in His blood,—justified plainly, in that we are
freed from all sin; and freed from all sin, because the Son of God, who
knew no sin, was slain for us. Therefore “we shall be saved from wrath
through Him;” from the wrath certainly of God, which is nothing else but
just retribution. For the wrath of God is not, as is that of man, a
perturbation of the mind; but it is the wrath of Him to whom Holy
Scripture says in another place, “But Thou, O Lord, mastering Thy power,
judgest with calmness.” <span id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md) If,
therefore, the just retribution of God has received such a name, what
can be the right understanding also of the reconciliation of God, unless
that then such wrath comes to an end? Neither were we enemies to God,
except as sins are enemies to righteousness; which being forgiven, such
enmities come to an end, and they whom He Himself justifies are
reconciled to the Just One. And yet certainly He loved them even while
still enemies, since “He spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up
for us all,” when we were still enemies. And therefore the apostle has
rightly added: “For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
by the death of His Son,” by which that remission of sins was made,
“much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.” Saved in
life, who were reconciled by death. For who can doubt that He will give
His life for His friends, for whom, when enemies, He gave His death?
“And not only so,” he says, “but we also joy in God, through our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.” “Not only,”
he says, “shall we be saved,” but “we also joy;” and not in ourselves,
but “in God;” nor through ourselves, “but through our Lord Jesus Christ,
by whom we have now received the atonement,” as we have argued above.
Then the apostle adds, “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the
world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all
have sinned;” <span id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md) etc.: in which he
disputes at some length concerning the two men; the one the first Adam,
through whose sin and death we, his descendants, are bound by, as it
were, hereditary evils; and the other the second Adam, who is not only
man, but also God, by whose payment for us of what He owed not, we are
freed from the debts both of our first father and of ourselves. Further,
since on account of that one the devil held all who were begotten
through his corrupted carnal concupiscence, it is just that on account
of this one he should loose all who are regenerated through His
immaculate spiritual grace.
