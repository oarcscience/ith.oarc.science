<span id="v.vi.xv-p1"></span> 14. Wherefore, that which is written, “Who
speaketh the truth in his heart,” <span
id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399) is not so to be taken, as if, truth
being retained in the heart, in the mouth one may speak a lie. But the
reason why it is said, is, because it is possible that a man may speak
with his mouth a truth which profiteth him nothing, if he hold it not in
his heart, that is, if what he speaketh, himself believe not; as the
heretics, and, above all, these same Priscillianists do, when they do,
not indeed believe the catholic faith, but yet speak it, that they may
be believed to be of us. They speak therefore the truth in their mouth,
not in their heart. On this account were they to be distinguished from
him of whom it is written, “He that speaketh truth in his heart.” Now
this truth the catholic as in his heart he speaketh, because so he
believeth, so also in his mouth ought he, that so he may preach it; but
against it, neither in heart nor in mouth have falsehood, that both with
the heart he may believe unto righteousness, and with the mouth may make
confession unto salvation. For also in that psalm, after it had been
said, “Who speaketh truth in his heart,” presently this is added, “Who
hath used no deceit in his tongue.” <span
