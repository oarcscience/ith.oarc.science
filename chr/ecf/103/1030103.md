<span id="iv.i.viii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.viii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Whether One or the Three
Persons Together are Called the Only God.</span>

<span id="iv.i.viii.ix-p2"></span>10. And since we are showing how we
can say the Father alone, because there is no Father in the Godhead
except Himself, we must consider also the opinion which holds that the
only true God is not the Father alone, but the Father and the Son and
the Holy Spirit. For if any one should ask whether the Father alone is
God, how can it be replied that He is not, unless perhaps we were to say
that the Father indeed is God, but that He is not God alone, but that
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are God alone? But then what shall we
do with that testimony of the Lord? For He was speaking to the Father,
and had named the Father as Him to whom He was speaking, when He says,
“And this is life eternal, that they may know Thee the one true
God.” <span id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618.md) And this the Arians indeed
usually take, as if the Son were not true God. Passing them by, however,
we must see whether, when it is said to the Father, “That they may know
Thee the one true God,” we are forced to understand it as if He wished
to intimate that the Father alone is the true God; lest we should not
understand any to be God, except the three together, the Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit. Are we therefore, from the testimony of the Lord, both
to call the Father the one true God, and the Son the one true God, and
the Holy Spirit the one true God, and the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit together, that is, the Trinity itself together, not three true
Gods but one true God? Or because He added, “And Jesus Christ whom Thou
hast sent,” are we to supply “the one true God;” so that the order of
the words is this, “That they may know Thee, and Jesus Christ whom Thou
hast sent, the one true God?” Why then did He omit to mention the Holy
Spirit? Is it because it follows, that whenever we name One who cleaves
to One by a harmony so great that through this harmony both are one,
this harmony itself must be understood, although it is not mentioned?
For in that place, too, the apostle seems as it were to pass over the
Holy Spirit; and yet there, too, He is understood, where he says, “All
are yours, and ye are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.” <span
id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619.md) And again, “The head of the woman is
the man, the head of the man is Christ, and the head of Christ is
God.” <span id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620.md) But again, if God is only
all three together, how can God be the head of Christ, that is, the
Trinity the head of Christ, since Christ is in the Trinity in order that
it may be the Trinity? Is that which is the Father with the Son, the
head of that which is the Son alone? For the Father with the Son is God,
but the Son alone is Christ: especially since it is the Word already
made flesh that speaks; and according to this His humiliation also, the
Father is greater than He, as He says, “for my Father is greater than
I;” <span id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621.md) so that the very being of
God, which is one to Him with the Father, is itself the head of the man
who is mediator, which He is alone. <span
id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622.md) For if we rightly call the mind the
chief thing of man, that is, as it were the head of the human substance,
although the man himself together with the mind is man; why is not the
Word with the Father, which together is God, much more suitably and much
more the head of Christ, although Christ as man cannot be understood
except with the Word which was made flesh? But this, as we have already
said, we shall consider somewhat more carefully hereafter. At present
the equality and one and the same substance of the Trinity has been
demonstrated as briefly as possible, that in whatever way that other
question be determined, the more rigorous discussion of which we have
deferred, nothing may hinder us from confessing the absolute equality of
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
