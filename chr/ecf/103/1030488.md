<span id="v.i.v-p1"></span> 5. And on this account that, which, the
parts that beget being bridled by modesty, is most chiefly and properly
to be called Continence, is violated by no transgression, if the higher
Continence, concerning which we have been some time speaking, be
preserved in the heart. For this reason the Lord, after He had said,
“For from the heart go forth evil thoughts,” then went on to add what it
is that belongs to evil thoughts, “murders, adulteries,” and the rest.
He spake not of all; but, having named certain by way of instance, He
taught that we are to understand others also. Of which there is no one
that can take place, unless an evil thought have gone before, whereby
that is prepared within which is done without, and going forth out of
the mouth of the heart already defiles the man, although, through no
power being granted, it be not done without by means of the members of
the body. When therefore a door of Continence hath been set in the mouth
of the heart, whence go out all that defile the man, if nothing such be
permitted to go out thence, there followeth a purity, wherein now the
conscience may rejoice; although there be not as yet that perfection,
wherein Continence shall not strive with vice. But now, so long as “the
flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the
flesh,” <span id="fr_1817"></span>[1818](#fn_1817) it is enough for us
not to consent unto the evils which we feel in us. But, when that
consent takes place, then there goeth out of the mouth of the heart what
defileth the man. But when through Continence consent is withheld, the
evil of the lust of the flesh, against which the lust of the spirit
fights, is not suffered to harm.
