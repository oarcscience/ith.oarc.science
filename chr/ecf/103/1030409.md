<span id="iv.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Of Christ’s Ascension into
Heaven.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii-p2"></span>13. We believe that <span
class="c19"><span id="iv.iv.vii-p2.1"></span>He Ascended into
Heaven</span>, which place of blessedness He has likewise promised unto
us, saying, “They shall be as the angels in the heavens,” <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md) in that city which is the mother of
us all, <span id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md) the Jerusalem eternal
in the heavens. But it is wont to give offense to certain parties,
either impious Gentiles or heretics, that we should believe in the
assumption of an earthly body into heaven. The Gentiles, however, for
the most part, set themselves diligently to ply us with the arguments of
the philosophers, to the effect of affirming that there cannot possibly
be anything earthly in heaven. For they know not our Scriptures, neither
do they understand how it has been said, “It is sown an animal body, it
is raised a spiritual body.” <span id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md)
For thus it has not been expressed, as if body were turned into spirit
and became spirit; inasmuch as at present, too, our body, which is
called animal (*animale*), has not been turned into soul and become soul
(*anima*). But by a spiritual body is meant one which has been made
subject to spirit in such wise <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md) that it is adapted to a heavenly
habitation, all frailty and every earthly blemish having been changed
and converted into heavenly purity and stability. This is the change
concerning which the apostle likewise speaks thus: “We shall all rise,
but we shall not all be changed.” <span
id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md) And that this change is made not
unto the worse, but unto the better, the same \[apostle\] teaches, when
he says, “And we shall be changed.” <span
id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md) But the question as to where and in
what manner the Lord’s body is in heaven, is one which it would be
altogether over-curious and superfluous to prosecute. Only we must
believe that it is in heaven. For it pertains not to our frailty to
investigate the secret things of heaven, but it does pertain to our
faith to hold elevated and honorable sentiments on the subject of the
dignity of the Lord’s body.
