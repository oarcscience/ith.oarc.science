<span id="v.i.xxiv-p1"></span> 24. If what we have made mention of out
of the Apostolic Epistles seem to you to fall short of an answer, hear
yet others, if ye have ears. What saith the utterly mad Manichæan of the
Flesh of Christ? That it was not true, but false. What saith the blessed
Apostle to this? “Remember that Christ Jesus rose again from the dead of
the seed of David, according to my Gospel.” <span
id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889) And Christ Jesus Himself saith,
“Handle and see, that a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me to
have.” <span id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890) How is there truth in
their doctrine, which asserts that in the Flesh of Christ there was
falsehood? How was there in Christ no evil, in Whom was so great a lie?
Because forsooth to men over-clean true flesh is an evil, and false
flesh instead of true is not an evil: it is an evil, true flesh of one
born of the seed of David, and it is no evil, false tongue of one
saying, “Handle, and see, that a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye
see me to have.” Of the Church what saith the deceiver of men with
deadly error? That on the side of souls it pertains unto Christ, on the
side of bodies unto the devil? What to this saith the Teacher of the
Gentiles in faith and truth? “Know ye not,” saith he, “that your bodies
are members of Christ?” <span id="fr_1891"></span>[1892](#fn_1891) Of
the sex of male and female what saith the son of perdition? That either
sex is not of God, but of the devil. What to this saith the Vessel of
Election? “As,” saith he, “the woman from out the man, so also the man
through the woman: but all things of God.” <span
id="fr_1892"></span>[1893](#fn_1892) Of the flesh what saith the unclean
spirit through the Manichæan? That it is an evil substance, and not the
creation of God, but of an enemy. What to this saith the Holy Spirit
through Paul? “For as the body is one,” saith he, “and hath many
members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body: so
also is Christ.” <span id="fr_1893"></span>[1894](#fn_1893) And a little
after; “God hath set,” saith he, “the members, each one of them in the
body, as He willed.” <span id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894) Also a
little after; “God,” saith he, “hath tempered the body, giving greater
honor unto that to which it was wanting, that there should be no schisms
in the body, but that the members have the self-same care one for
another: and whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it:
or one member be glorified, all the members rejoice with it.” <span
id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895) How is the flesh evil, when the
souls themselves are admonished to imitate the peace of its members? How
is it the creation of the enemy, when the souls themselves, which rule
the bodies, take pattern from the members of the body, not to have
schisms of enmities among themselves, in order that, what God hath
granted unto the body by nature, this themselves also may love to have
by grace? With good cause, writing to the Romans, “I beseech you,” saith
he, “brethren, by the mercy of God, that ye present your bodies a
sacrifice, living, holy, pleasing to God.” <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896) Without reason we contend that
darkness is not light, nor light darkness, if we present a sacrifice,
living, holy, pleasing to God, of the bodies of the “nation of
darkness.”
