<span id="iv.vi.xxv-p1"></span> 24. But you say, Were it not better that
you should give me a reason, that, wherever, that shall lead me, I may
follow without any rashness? Perhaps it were: but, it being so great a
matter, that you are by reason to come to the knowledge of God, do you
think that all are qualified to understand the reasons, by which the
human soul is led to know God, or many, or few? Few I think, you say. Do
you believe that you are in the number of these? It is not for me, you
say, to answer this. Therefore you think it is for him to believe you in
this also: and this indeed he does: only do you remember, that he hath
already twice believed you saying things uncertain; that you are
unwilling to believe him even once admonishing you in a religious
spirit. But suppose that it is so, and that you approach with a true
mind to receive religion, and that you are one of few men in such sense
as to be able to take in the reasons by which the Divine Power <span
id="fr_1734"></span>[1735](#fn_1734.md) is brought into certain knowledge;
what? do you think that other men, who are not endued with so serene a
disposition, are to be denied religion? or do you think that they are to
be led gradually by certain steps unto those highest inner recesses? You
see clearly which is the more religious. For you cannot think that any
one whatever in a case where he desires so great a thing, ought by any
means to be abandoned or rejected. But do you not think, that, unless he
do first believe that he shall attain unto that which he purposes; and
do yield his mind as a suppliant; and, submitting to certain great and
necessary precepts, do by a certain course of life thoroughly cleanse
it, that he will not otherwise attain the things that are purely true?
Certainly you think so. What, then, is the case of those, (of whom I
already believe you to be one,) who are able most easily to receive
divine secrets by sure reason, will it, I ask, be to them any hindrance
at all, if they so come as they who at the first believe? I think not.
But yet, you say, what need to delay them? Because although they will in
no way harm themselves by what is done, yet they will harm the rest by
the precedent. For there is hardly one who has a just notion of his own
power: but he who has a less notion must be roused; he who has a greater
notion must be checked: that neither the one be broken by despair, nor
the other carried headlong by rashness. And this is easily done, if even
they, who are able to fly, (that they be not alluring the occasion of
any into danger,) are forced for a short time to walk where the rest
also may walk with safety. This is the forethought of true religion:
this the command of God: this what hath been handed down from our
blessed forefathers, this what hath been preserved even unto us: to wish
to distrust and overthrow this, is nothing else than to seek a
sacrilegious way unto true religion. And whoso do this, not even if what
they wish be granted to them are they able to arrive at the point at
which they aim. For whatever kind of excellent genius they have, unless
God be present, they creep on the ground. But He is then present, if
they, who are aiming at God, have a regard for their fellow men. Than
which step there can be found nothing more sure Heavenward. I for my
part cannot resist this reasoning, for how can I say that we are to
believe nothing without certain knowledge? whereas both there can be no
friendship at all, unless there be believed something which cannot be
proved by some reason, and often stewards, who are slaves, are trusted
by their masters without any fault on their part. But in religion what
can there be more unfair than that the ministers <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735.md) of God believe us when we promise
an unfeigned mind, and we are unwilling to believe them when they enjoin
us any thing. Lastly, what way can there be more healthful, than for a
man to become fitted to receive the truth by believing those things,
which have been appointed by God to serve for the previous culture and
treatment of the mind? Or, if you be already altogether fitted, rather
to make some little circuit where it is safest to tread, than both to
cause yourself danger, and to be a precedent for rashness to other men?
