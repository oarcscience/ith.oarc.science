<span id="v.vi.iii-p1"></span> 2. Perceivest thou not how much this
reasoning aideth the very persons whom as great game we make ado to
catch by our lies? For, as thyself hast shown, this is the sentiment of
the Priscillianists to prove which, they apply testimonies from the
Scriptures exhorting their followers to lie, as though by the examples
of Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Angels; not hesitating to add even
the Lord Christ Himself; and deeming that they cannot otherwise prove
their falsehood truthful, unless they pronounce Truth to be a liar. It
must be refuted, this; not imitated: nor ought we to be partners with
the Priscillianists in that evil in which they are convicted to be worse
than other heretics. For they alone, or at least they in the greatest
degree, are found to make a dogma of lying for the purpose of hiding
their truth, as they call it: and this so great evil therefore to esteem
just, because they say that in the heart must be held that which is
true, but with the mouth to utter unto aliens a false thing, is no sin;
and that this is written, “Who speaketh the truth in his heart:” <span
id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385.md) as though this were enough for
righteousness, even though a person do with his mouth speak a lie, when
not his neighbor but a stranger is he that heareth it. On this account
they think the Apostle Paul, when he had said, “Putting away lying,
speak ye truth,” to have immediately added, “Every man with his
neighbor, for we are members one of another.” <span
id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386.md) Meaning, that with them who are not
our neighbors in society of the truth, nor, so to say, our
co-members, <span id="fr_2387"></span>[2388](#fn_2387.md) it is lawful and
right to speak a lie.
