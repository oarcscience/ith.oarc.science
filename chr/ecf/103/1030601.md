<span id="v.iii.xlviii-p1"></span> 47. But, as I had begun to say,
whether the fruit an hundred-fold be virginity dedicated to God, or
whether we are to understand that interval of fruitfulness in some other
way, either such as we have made mention of, or such as we have not made
mention of; yet no one, as I suppose, will have dared to prefer
virginity to martyrdom, and no one will have doubted that this latter
gift is hidden, if trial to test it be wanting. A virgin, therefore,
hath a subject for thought, such as may be of profit to her for the
keeping of humility, that she violate not that charity, which is above
all gifts, without which assuredly whatever other gifts she shall have
had, whether few or many, whether great or small, she is nothing. She
hath, I say, a subject for thought, that she be not puffed up, that she
rival not; forsooth that she so make profession that the virginal good
is much greater and better than the married good, as that yet she know
not whether this or that married woman be not already able to suffer for
Christ, but herself as yet unable, and she herein spared, that her
weakness is not put to the question by trial. “For God,” saith the
Apostle, “is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tried above what ye
are able but will make with the trial a way out, that ye may be able to
bear it.” <span id="fr_2196"></span>[2197](#fn_2196) Perhaps, therefore,
those men or women keeping a way of married life praiseworthy in its
kind, are already able, against an enemy forcing to unrighteousness, to
contend even by tearing in pieces of bowels, and shedding of blood; but
these men or women, continent from childhood, and making themselves
eunuchs for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven, still are not as yet able
to endure such, either for righteousness, or for chastity itself. For it
is one thing, for truth and an holy purpose, not to consent unto one who
would persuade and flatter, but another thing not to yield even to one
who tortures and strikes. These lie hid in the powers and strength of
souls, by trial they are unfolded, by actual essay they come forth. In
order, therefore, that each be not puffed up by reason of that, which he
sees clearly that he can do, let him humbly consider that he knows not
that there is perchance something more excellent which he cannot do, but
that some, who neither have nor profess that of which he is lawfully
self-conscious, are able to do this, which he himself cannot do. Thus
will be kept, not by feigned but by true humility, “In honor preventing
one another,” <span id="fr_2197"></span>[2198](#fn_2197) and, “esteeming
each the other higher than himself.” <span
id="fr_2198"></span>[2199](#fn_2198)
