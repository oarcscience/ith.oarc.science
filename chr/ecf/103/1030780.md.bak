<span id="v.viii.vi-p1"></span> 5. When therefore thou shall see any man
suffer aught patiently, do not straightway praise it as patience; for
this is only shown by the cause of suffering. When it is a good cause,
then is it true patience: when that is not polluted by lust, then is
this distinguished from falsity. But when that is placed in crime, then
is this much misplaced in name. For not just as all who know are
partakers of knowledge, just so are all who suffer partakers of
patience: but they which rightly use the suffering, these in verity of
patience are praised, these with the prize of patience are crowned.
