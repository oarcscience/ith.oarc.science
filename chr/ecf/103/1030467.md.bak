<span id="iv.vii.iii-p1"></span> 3. For this reason we believe also in
His Son, that is to say, God the Father Almighty’s, “His Only Son, our
Lord.” When thou hearest of the Only Son of God, acknowledge Him God.
For it could not be that God’s Only Son should not be God. What He is,
the same did He beget, though He is not that Person Whom He begot. If He
be truly Son, He is that which the Father is; if He be not that which
the Father is, He is not truly Son. Observe mortal and earthly
creatures: what each is, that it engendereth. Man besets not an ox,
sheep besets not dog, nor dog sheep. Whatever it be that begetteth, that
which it is, it begetteth. Hold ye therefore boldly, firmly, faithfully,
that the Begotten of God the Father is what Himself is, Almighty. These
mortal creatures engender by corruption. Does God so beget? He that is
begotten mortal generates that which himself is; the Immortal generates
what He is: corruptible begets corruptible, Incorruptible begets
Incorruptible: the corruptible begets corruptibly, Incorruptible,
Incorruptibly: yea, so begetteth what Itself is, that One begets One,
and therefore Only. Ye know, that when I pronounced to you the Creed, so
I said, and so ye are bounden to believe; that we “believe in God the
Father Almighty, and in Jesus Christ His Only Son.” Here too, when thou
believest that He is the Only, believe Him Almighty: for it is not to be
thought that God the Father does what He will, and God the Son does not
what He will. One Will of Father and Son, because one Nature. For it is
impossible for the will of the Son to be any whit parted from the
Father’s will. God and God; both one God: Almighty and Almighty; both
One Almighty.
