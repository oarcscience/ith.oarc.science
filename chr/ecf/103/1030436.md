<span id="iv.vi.x-p1"></span> 9. Here therefore these men too evil,
while they essay to make void the Law, force us to approve these
Scriptures. For they mark what is said, that they who are under the Law
are in bondage, and they keep flying above the rest that last saying,
“Ye are made empty <span id="fr_1714"></span>[1715](#fn_1714) of Christ,
as many of you as are justified in the Law; ye have fallen from
Grace.” <span id="fr_1715"></span>[1716](#fn_1715) We grant that all
these things are true, and we say that the Law is not necessary, save
for them unto whom bondage is yet profitable: and that the Law was on
this account profitably enacted, in that men, who could not be recalled
from sins by reason, needed to be restrained by such a Law, that is to
say, by the threats and terrors of those punishments which can be seen
by fools: from which when the Grace of Christ sets us free, it condemns
not that Law, but invites us at length to yield obedience to its love,
not to be slaves to the fear of the Law. Itself is Grace, that is free
gift, <span id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716) which they understand
not to have come to them from God, who still desire to be under the
bonds of the Law. Whom Paul deservedly rebukes as unbelievers, because
they do not believe that now through our Lord Jesus they have been set
free from that bondage, under which they were placed for a certain time
by the most just appointment of God. Hence is that saying of the same
Apostle, “For the Law was our schoolmaster in Christ.” <span
id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717) He therefore gave to men a
schoolmaster to fear, Who after gave a Master to love. And yet in these
precepts and commands of the Law, which now it is not allowed Christians
to use, such as either the Sabbath, or Circumcision, or Sacrifices, and
if there be any thing of this kind, so great mysteries are contained, as
that every pious person may understand, there is nothing more deadly
than that whatever is there be understood to the letter, that is, to the
word: <span id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718) and nothing more
healthful than that it be unveiled in the Spirit. Hence it is: “The
letter killeth, but the Spirit quickeneth.” <span
id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719) Hence it is, “That same veil
remaineth in the reading of the Old Testament, which veil is not taken
away; since it is made void in Christ.” <span
id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720) For there is made void in Christ,
not the Old Testament, but its veil: that so through Christ that may be
understood, and, as it were, laid bare, which without Christ is obscure
and covered. Forasmuch as the same Apostle straightway adds, “But when
thou shalt have passed over to Christ, the veil shall be taken
away.” <span id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721) For he saith not, the
Law shall be taken away, or, the Old Testament. Not therefore through
the Grace of the Lord, as though useless things were there hidden, have
they been taken away; but rather the covering whereby useful things were
covered. In this manner all they are dealt with, who earnestly and
piously, not disorderly and shamelessly, seek the sense of those
Scriptures, and they are carefully shown both the order of events, and
the causes of deeds and words, and so great agreement of the Old
Testament with the New, that there is left no jot <span
id="fr_1722"></span>[1723](#fn_1722) that agrees not; and so great
secrets of figures, that all the things that are drawn forth by
interpretation force them to confess that they are wretched, who will to
condemn these before they learn them.
