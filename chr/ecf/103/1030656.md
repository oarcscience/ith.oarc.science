<span id="v.v.xiii-p1"></span> 12. Thus has the question been on both
sides considered and treated; and still it is not easy to pass sentence:
but we must further lend diligent hearing to those who say, that no deed
is so evil, but that in avoidance of a worse it ought to be done;
moreover that the deeds of men include not only what they do, but
whatever they consent to be done unto them. Wherefore, if cause have
arisen that a Christian man should choose to burn incense to idols, that
he might not consent to bodily defilement which the persecutor
threatened him withal, unless he should do so, they think they have a
right to ask why he should not also tell a lie to escape so foul a
disgrace. For the consent itself to endure violation of the person
rather than to burn incense to idols, this, they say, is not a passive
thing, but a deed; which rather than do, he chose to burn incense. How
much more readily then would he have chosen a lie, if by a lie he might
ward off from a holy body so shocking a disgrace?
