<span id="v.vi.xxxviii-p1"></span> 37. Add to this, (and here is cause
to cry out more piteously,) that, if once we grant it to have been right
for the saving of that sick man’s life to tell him the lie, that his son
was alive, then, by little and little and by minute degrees, the evil so
grows upon us, and by slight accesses to such a heap of wicked lies does
it, in its almost imperceptible encroachments, at last come, that no
place can ever be any where found on which this huge mischief, by
smallest additions rising into boundless strength, might be resisted.
Wherefore, most providently is it written, “He that despiseth small
things shall fall by little and little.” <span
id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460.md) Nay more: for these persons who are
so enamored of this life, that they hesitate not to prefer it to truth,
that a man may not die, say rather, that a man who must some time die
may die somewhat later, would have us not only to lie, but even to swear
fasely; to wit, that, lest the vain health of man should somewhat more
quickly pass away, we should take the name of the Lord our God in vain!
And there are among them learned men who even fix rules, and set bounds
when it is a duty, when not a duty, to commit perjury! O, where are ye,
fountains of tears? And what shall we do? whither go? where hide us from
the ire of truth, if we not only neglect to shun lies, but dare moreover
to teach perjuries? For look they well to it, who uphold and defend
lying, what kind, or what kinds, of lying they shall delight to justify:
at least in the worship of God let them grant that there must be no
lying; at least let them keep themselves from perjuries and blasphemies;
at least there, where God’s name, where God as witness, where God’s
oath <span id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461.md) is interposed, where
God’s religion is the matter of discourse or colloquy, let none lie,
none praise, none teach and enjoin, none justify a lie: of the other
kinds of lies let him choose him out that which he accounteth to be the
mildest and most innocent kind of lying, he who will have it to be right
to lie. This I know, that even he who teaches that it is meet to tell
lies, wishes to be thought to teach a truth. For if it be false which he
teaches, who would care to give heed to false doctrine, in which both he
deceives that teaches and he is deceived that learns? But if, in order
that he may be able to find some disciple, he upholds that he teaches a
truth when he teaches that it is meet to lie, how will that lie be of
the truth, when the Apostle John reclaimeth, “No lie is of the
truth?” <span id="fr_2462"></span>[2463](#fn_2462.md) It is therefore not
true, that it is sometimes right to lie; and that which is not true to
no man is at all to be persuaded.
