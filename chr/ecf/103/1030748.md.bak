<span id="v.vii.xvii"></span>

<span id="v.vii.xvii-p1"></span> 16. For he himself also, with an eye to
the like necessities of saints, who, although they obey his precepts,
“that with silence they work and eat their own bread,” may yet from many
causes stand in need of somewhat by way of supplement to the like
sustenance, therefore, after he had thus said, teaching and
premonishing, “Now them which are such we command and beseech in our
Lord Jesus Christ, that with silence they work and eat their own
bread;” <span id="fr_2520"></span>[2521](#fn_2520.md) yet, lest they which
had whereof they might supply the needs of the servants of God, should
hence take occasion to wax lazy, providing against this he hath
straightway added, “But ye, brethren, become not weak in showing
beneficence.” <span id="fr_2521"></span>[2522](#fn_2521.md) And when he was
writing to Titus, saying, “Zenas the lawyer and Apollos do thou
diligently send forward, that nothing may be wanting to them;” <span
id="fr_2522"></span>[2523](#fn_2522.md) that he might show from what
quarter nothing ought to be wanting to them, he straightway subjoined,
“But let ours also learn to maintain good works <span
id="fr_2523"></span>[2524](#fn_2523.md) for necessary use, that they be not
unfruitful.” In the case of Timothy also, <span
id="fr_2524"></span>[2525](#fn_2524.md) whom he calls his own most
true <span id="fr_2525"></span>[2526](#fn_2525.md) son, because he knew him
weak of body, (as he shows, in advising him not to drink water, but to
use a little wine for his stomach’s sake and his often infirmities,)
lest then haply, because in bodily work he could not labor, he being
unwilling to stand in need of daily food at their hands, unto <span
id="page_512">p. 512</span> <span id="v.vii.xvii-Page_512"></span>whom
he ministered the Gospel, should seek some business in which the stress
of his mind would become entangled; (for it is one thing to labor in
body, with the mind free, as does a handicraftsman, if he be not
fraudulent and avaricious and greedy of his own private gain; but
another thing, to occupy the mind itself with cares of collecting money
without the body’s labor, as do either dealers, or bailiffs, or
undertakers, for these with care of the mind conduct their business, not
with their hands do work, and in that regard occupy their mind itself
with solicitude of getting;) lest then Timothy should fall upon such
like ways, because from weakness of body he could not work with his
hands, he thus exhorts, admonishes, and comforts him: “Labor,” saith he,
“as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man, going a warfare for God,
entangleth himself with secular business; that he may please Him to whom
he hath proved himself. <span id="fr_2526"></span>[2527](#fn_2526.md) For
he that striveth for masteries, is not crowned except he strive
lawfully.” <span id="fr_2527"></span>[2528](#fn_2527.md) Hereupon, lest the
other should be put to straits, saying, “Dig I cannot, to beg I am
ashamed,” <span id="fr_2528"></span>[2529](#fn_2528.md) he adjoined, “The
husbandman that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits:”
according to that which he had said to the Corinthians, “Who goeth a
warfare any time at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth
not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth a flock, and partaketh not of the
milk of the flock?” <span id="fr_2529"></span>[2530](#fn_2529.md) Thus did
he make to be without care a chaste evangelist, not to that end working
as an evangelist that he might sell the Gospel, but yet not, having
strength to supply unto himself with his own hands the necessities of
this life; for that he should understand whatever being necessary for
himself he was taking of them whom as provincials he as a soldier was
serving, and whom as a vineyard he was culturing, or as a flock was
feeding, to be not matter of mendicity, but of power.
