<span id="iv.i.xiv.viii-p2"></span>13. A common nature, therefore, is
recognized in their minds, but in their bodies a division of that one
mind itself is figured. As we ascend, then, by certain steps of thought
within, along the succession of the parts of the mind, there where
something first meets us which is not common to ourselves with the
beasts reason begins, so that here the inner man can now be recognized.
And if this inner man himself, through that reason to which the
administering of things temporal has been delegated, slips on too far by
over-much progress into outward things, that which is his head moreover
consenting, that is, the (so to call it) masculine part which presides
in the watch-tower of counsel not restraining or bridling it: then he
waxeth old because of all his enemies, <span

the devil, who are envious of virtue; and that vision of eternal things
is withdrawn also from the head himself, eating with his spouse that
which was forbidden, so that the light of his eyes is gone from
him; <span id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763) and so both being naked
from that enlightenment of truth, and with the eyes of their conscience
opened to behold how they were left shameful and unseemly, like the
leaves of sweet fruits, but without the fruits themselves, they so weave
together good words without the fruit of good works, as while living
wickedly to cover over their disgrace as it were by speaking well. <span
