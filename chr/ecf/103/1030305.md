<span id="iv.ii.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 55.—The Expression, “Christ Shall
Judge the Quick and the Dead,” May Be Understood in Either of Two
Senses.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lvii-p2"></span>Now the expression, “to judge the quick
and the dead,” may be interpreted in two ways: either we may understand
by the “quick” those who at His advent shall not yet have died, but whom
He shall find alive in the flesh, and by the “dead” those who have
departed from the body, or who shall have departed before His coming; or
we may understand the “quick” to mean the righteous, and the “dead” the
unrighteous; for the righteous shall be judged as well as others. Now
the judgment of God is sometimes taken in a bad sense, as, for example,
“They that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment;” <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183.md) sometimes in a good sense, as,
“Save me, O God, by Thy name, and judge me by Thy strength.” <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184.md) This is easily understood when we
consider that it is the judgment of God which separates the good from
the evil, and sets the good at His right hand, that they may be
delivered from evil, and not destroyed with the wicked; and it is for
this reason that the Psalmist cried, “Judge me, O God,” and then added,
as if in explanation, “and distinguish my cause from that of an ungodly
nation.” <span id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185.md)
