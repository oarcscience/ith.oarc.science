<span id="v.vi.xl-p1"></span> 39. But, some man will say, “Strong meat
is for them that are perfect.” <span
id="fr_2463"></span>[2464](#fn_2463) For in many things a relaxation by
way of indulgence is allowed to infirmity, although in her utmost
sincerity the things be nowise pleasing to truth. Let him say this,
whoever dreads not the consequences which are to be dreaded, if once
there shall be in any way any lies permitted. In nowise, however, must
they be permitted to climb up to such a height as to reach to perjuries
and blasphemies: nor must any plea whatever be held out, for which it
should be right that perjury should be committed, or, what is more
execrable, that God should be blasphemed. For it does not follow that
because the blaspheming is only in pretence and a lie, therefore He is
not blasphemed. For at this rate it might be said that perjury is not
committed, because it is by a lie that it is committed: for who can be
by truth a perjurer? So also by truth can no man be a blasphemer.
Doubtless it is a milder kind of false swearing, when a person does not
know that thing to be false and believes it to be true, which he swears:
like as also Saul blasphemed more excusably, because he did it
ignorantly. <span id="fr_2464"></span>[2465](#fn_2464) But the reason
why it is worse to blaspheme than to perjure one’s self, is, that in
false swearing God is taken to witness a false thing, but in blaspheming
false things are spoken of God Himself. Now by so much is a man more
inexcusable, whether perjurer or blasphemer, by how much the more, while
asserting the things wherein they perjure or blaspheme, they know or
believe them to be false. Whoever therefore says that for an imperilled
man’s temporal safety or life a lie may be told, doth too much himself
swerve from the path of eternal safety and life, if he says that on that
behalf one may even swear by God, or even blaspheme God.
