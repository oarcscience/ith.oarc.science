<span id="v.v.viii-p1"></span> 7. Neither do they confess that they are
awed by those citations from the Old Testament which are alleged as
examples of lies: for there, every incident may possibly be taken
figuratively, although it really did take place: and when a thing is
either done or said figuratively, it is no lie. For every utterance is
to be referred to that which it utters. But when any thing is either
done or said figuratively, it utters that which it signifies to those
for whose understanding it was put forth. Whence we may believe in
regard of those persons of the prophetical times who are set forth as
authoritative, that in all that is written of them they acted and spoke
prophetically; and no less, that there is a prophetical meaning in all
those incidents of their lives which by the same prophetic Spirit have
been accounted worthy of being recorded in writing. As to the midwives,
indeed, they cannot say that these women did through the prophetic
Spirit, with purpose of signifying a future truth, tell Pharaoh one
thing instead of another, (albeit that Spirit did signify something,
without their knowing what was doing in their persons:) but, they say
that these women were according to their degree approved and rewarded of
God. For if a person who is used to tell lies for harm’s sake comes to
tell them for the sake of doing good, that person has made great
progress. But it is one thing that is set forth as laudable in itself,
another that in comparison with a worse is preferred. It is one sort of
gratulation that we express when a man is in sound health, another when
a sick man is getting better. In the Scripture, even Sodom is said to be
<span id="page_461">p. 461</span> <span
id="v.v.viii-Page_461"></span>justified in comparison with the crimes of
the people Israel. And to this rule they apply all the instances of
lying which are produced from the Old Books, and are found not
reprehended, or cannot be reprehended: either they are approved on the
score of a progress towards improvement and hope of better things, or in
virtue of some hidden signification they are not altogether lies.
