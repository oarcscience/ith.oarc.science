<span id="iv.i.iv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—The Son and Holy Spirit are Not
Therefore Less Because Sent. The Son is Sent Also by Himself. Of the
Sending of the Holy Spirit.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.vi-p2"></span>7. But being proved wrong so far, men
betake themselves to saying, that he who sends is greater than he who is
sent: therefore the Father is greater than the Son, because the Son
continually speaks of Himself as being sent by the Father; and the
Father is also greater than the Holy Spirit, because Jesus has said of
the Spirit, “Whom the Father will send in my name;” <span
id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) and the Holy Spirit is less than both,
because both the Father sends Him, as we have said, and the Son, when He
says, “But if I depart, I will send Him unto you.” I first ask, then, in
this inquiry, whence and whither the Son was sent. “I,” He says, “came
forth from the Father, and am come into the world.” <span
id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) Therefore, to be sent, is to come
forth forth from the Father, and to come into the world. What, then, is
that which the same evangelist says concerning Him, “He was in the
world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not;” and
then he adds, “He came unto His own?” <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) Certainly He was sent thither, whither
He came; but if He was sent into the world, because He came forth from
the Father, then He both came into the world and was in the world. He
was sent therefore thither, where He already was. For consider that,
too, which is written in the prophet, that God said, “Do not I fill
heaven and earth?” <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) If this is
said of the Son (for some will have it understood that the Son Himself
spoke either by the prophets or in the prophets), whither was He sent
except to the place where He already was? For He who says, “I fill
heaven and earth,” was everywhere. But if it is said of the Father,
where could He be without His own word and without His own wisdom, which
“reacheth from one end to another mightily, and sweetly ordereth all
things?” <span id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) But He cannot be
anywhere without His own Spirit. Therefore, if God is everywhere, His
Spirit also is everywhere. Therefore, the Holy Spirit, too, was sent
thither, where He already was. For he, too, who finds no place to which
he might go from the presence of God, and who says, “If I ascend up into
heaven, Thou art there; if I shall go down into hell, behold, Thou art
there;” wishing it to be understood that God is present everywhere,
named in the previous verse His Spirit; for He says,” Whither shall I go
from Thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from Thy presence?” <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.vi-p9"></span>8. For this reason, then, if both the
Son and the Holy Spirit are sent thither where they were, we must
inquire, how that sending, whether of the Son or of the Holy Spirit, is
to be understood; for of the Father alone, we nowhere read that He is
sent. Now, of the Son, the apostle writes thus: “But when the fullness
of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made
under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.” <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) “He sent,” he says, “His Son, made of
a woman.” And by this term, woman, <span
id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) what Catholic does not know that he
did not wish to signify the privation of virginity; but, according to a
Hebraism, the difference of sex? When, therefore, he says, “God sent His
Son, made of a woman,” he sufficiently shows that the Son was “sent” in
this very way, in that He was “made of a woman.” Therefore, in that He
was born of God, He was in the world; but in that He was born of Mary,
He was sent and came into the world. Moreover, He could not be sent by
the Father without the Holy Spirit, not only because the Father, when He
sent Him, that is, when He made Him of a woman, is certainly understood
not to have so made Him without His own Spirit; but also because it is
most plainly and expressly said in the Gospel in answer to the Virgin
Mary, when she asked of the angel, <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.vi-Page_41"></span>“How shall this be?” “The Holy Ghost
shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
thee.” <span id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) And Matthew says, “She
was found with child of the Holy Ghost.” <span
id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) Although, too, in the prophet Isaiah,
Christ Himself is understood to say of His own future advent, “And now
the Lord God and His Spirit hath sent me.” <span
id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.vi-p15"></span>9. Perhaps some one may wish to drive
us to say, that the Son is sent also by Himself, because the conception
and childbirth of Mary is the working of the Trinity, by whose act of
creating all things are created. And how, he will go on to say, has the
Father sent Him, if He sent Himself? To whom I answer first, by asking
him to tell me, if he can, in what manner the Father hath sanctified
Him, if He hath sanctified Himself? For the same Lord says both; “Say ye
of Him,” He says, “whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the
world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God;” <span
id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) while in another place He says, “And
for their sake I sanctify myself.” <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) I ask, also, in what manner the Father
delivered Him, if He delivered Himself? For the Apostle Paul says both:
“Who,” he says, “spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us
all;” <span id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) while elsewhere he says of
the Saviour Himself, “Who loved me, and delivered Himself for me.” <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) He will reply, I suppose, if he has a
right sense in these things, Because the will of the Father and the Son
is one, and their working indivisible. In like manner, then, let him
understand the incarnation and nativity of the Virgin, wherein the Son
is understood as sent, to have been wrought by one and the same
operation of the Father and of the Son indivisibly; the Holy Spirit
certainly not being thence excluded, of whom it is expressly said, “She
was found with child by the Holy Ghost.” For perhaps our meaning will be
more plainly unfolded, if we ask in what manner God sent His Son. He
commanded that He should come, and He, complying with the commandment,
came. Did He then request, or did He only suggest? But whichever of
these it was, certainly it was done by a word, and the Word of God is
the Son of God Himself. Wherefore, since the Father sent Him by a word,
His being sent was the work of both the Father and His Word; therefore
the same Son was sent by the Father and the Son, because the Son Himself
is the Word of the Father. For who would embrace so impious an opinion
as to think the Father to have uttered a word in time, in order that the
eternal Son might thereby be sent and might appear in the flesh in the
fullness of time? But assuredly it was in that Word of God itself which
was in the beginning with God and was God, namely, in the wisdom itself
of God, apart from time, at what time that wisdom must needs appear in
the flesh. Therefore, since without any commencement of time, the Word
was in the beginning, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,
it was in the Word itself without any time, at what time the Word was to
be made flesh and dwell among us. <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) And when this fullness of time had
come, “God sent His Son, made of a woman,” <span
id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) that is, made in time, that the
Incarnate Word might appear to men; while it was in that Word Himself,
apart from time, at what time this was to be done; for the order of
times is in the eternal wisdom of God without time. Since, then, that
the Son should appear in the flesh was wrought by both the Father and
the Son, it is fitly said that He who appeared in that flesh was sent,
and that He who did not appear in it, sent Him; because those things
which are transacted outwardly before the bodily eyes have their
existence from the inward structure (*apparatu*) of the spiritual
nature, and on that account are fitly said to be sent. Further, that
form of man which He took is the person of the Son, not also of the
Father; on which account the invisible Father, together with the Son,
who with the Father is invisible, is said to have sent the same Son by
making Him visible. But if He became visible in such way as to cease to
be invisible with the Father, that is, if the substance of the invisible
Word were turned by a change and transition into a visible creature,
then the Son would be so understood to be sent by the Father, that He
would be found to be only sent; not also, with the Father, sending. But
since He so took the form of a servant, as that the unchangeable form of
God remained, it is clear that that which became apparent in the Son was
done by the Father and the Son not being apparent; that is, that by the
invisible Father, with the invisible Son, the same Son Himself was sent
so as to be visible. Why, therefore, does He say, “Neither came I of
myself?” This, we may now say, is said according to the form of a
servant, in the same way as it is said, “I judge no man.” <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.vi-p23"></span>10. If, therefore, He is said to be
sent, in so far as He appeared outwardly in the bodily creature, who
inwardly in His spiritual nature is always hidden from the eyes of
mortals, it is now easy to understand also of the Holy <span
id="page_42">p. 42</span> <span id="iv.i.iv.vi-Page_42"></span>Spirit
why He too is said to be sent. For in due time a certain outward
appearance of the creature was wrought, wherein the Holy Spirit might be
visibly shown; whether when He descended upon the Lord Himself in a
bodily shape as a dove, <span id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) or when,
ten days having past since His ascension, on the day of Pentecost a
sound came suddenly from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and cloven
tongues like as of fire were seen upon them, and it sat upon each of
them. <span id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) This operation, visibly
exhibited, and presented to mortal eyes, is called the sending of the
Holy Spirit; not that His very substance appeared, in which He himself
also is invisible and unchangeable, like the Father and the Son, but
that the hearts of men, touched by things seen outwardly, might be
turned from the manifestation in time of Him as coming to His hidden
eternity as ever present.
