<span id="iv.ii.ii-p4"></span>*Laurentius having asked Augustin to
furnish him with a handbook of Christian doctrine, containing in brief
compass answers to several questions which he had proposed, Augustin
shows him that these questions can be fully answered by any one who
knows the proper objects of faith, hope, and love. He then proceeds, in
the first part of the work (Chap. ix.—cxiii.), to expound the objects of
faith, taking as his text the Apostles’ Creed; and in the course of this
exposition, besides refuting divers heresies, he throws out many
observations on the conduct of life. The second part of the work (Chap.
cxiv.—cxvi.) treats of the objects of hope, and consists of a very brief
exposition of the several petitions in the Lord’s Prayer. The third and
concluding part (Chap. cxvii.-cxxii.) treats of the objects of love,
showing the pre-eminence of this grace in the gospel system, that it is
the end of the commandment and the fulfilling of the law, and that God
himself is love.*
