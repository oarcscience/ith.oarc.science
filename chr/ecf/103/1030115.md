<span id="iv.i.x.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.x.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—Every Corporeal Conception Must
Be Rejected, in Order that It May Be Understood How God is Truth.</span>

<span id="iv.i.x.iii-p2"></span>3. But in respect to bodies, it may be
the case that this gold and that gold may be equally true \[real\], but
this may be greater than that, since magnitude is not the same thing in
this case as truth; and it is one thing for it to be gold, another to be
great. So also in the nature of the soul; a soul is not called great in
the same respect in which it is called true. For he, too, has a true
\[real\] soul who has not a great soul; since the essence of body and
soul is not the essence of the truth \[reality\] itself; as is the
Trinity, one God, alone, great, true, truthful, the truth. Of whom if we
endeavor to think, so far as He Himself permits and grants, let us not
think of any touch or embrace in local space, as if of three bodies, or
of any compactness of conjunction, as fables tell of three-bodied
Geryon; but let whatsoever may occur to the mind, that is of such sort
as to be greater in three than in each singly, and less in one than in
two, be rejected without any doubt; for so everything corporeal is
rejected. But also in spiritual things let nothing changeable that may
have occurred to the mind be thought of God. For when we aspire from
this depth to that height, it is a step towards no small knowledge, if,
before we can know what God is, we can already know what He is not. For
certainly He is neither earth nor heaven; nor, as it were, earth and
heaven; nor any such thing as we see in the heaven; nor any such thing
as we do not see, but which perhaps is in heaven. Neither if you were to
magnify in the imagination of your thought the light of the sun as much
as you are able, either that it may be greater, or that it may be
brighter, a thousand times as much, or times without number; neither is
this God. Neither as <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) we think of
the pure angels as spirits animating celestial bodies, and changing and
dealing with them after the will by which they serve God; not even if
all, and there are “thousands of thousands,” <span
id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md) were brought together into one, and
became one; neither is any such thing God. Neither if you were to think
of the same spirits as without bodies—a thing indeed most difficult for
carnal thought to do. Behold and see, if thou canst, O soul pressed down
by the corruptible body, and weighed down by earthly thoughts, many and
various; behold and see, if thou canst, that God is truth. <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) For it is written that “God is
light;” <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) not in such <span
id="page_117">p. 117</span> <span id="iv.i.x.iii-Page_117"></span>way as
these eyes see, but in such way as the heart sees, when it is said, He
is truth \[reality\]. Ask not what is truth \[reality\] for immediately
the darkness of corporeal images and the clouds of phantasms will put
themselves in the way, and will disturb that calm which at the first
twinkling shone forth to thee, when I said truth \[reality\]. See that
thou remainest, if thou canst, in that first twinkling with which thou
art dazzled, as it were, by a flash, when it is said to thee, Truth
\[Reality\]. But thou canst not; thou wilt glide back into those usual
and earthly things. And what weight, pray, is it that will cause thee so
to glide back, unless it be the bird-lime of the stains of appetite thou
hast contracted, and the errors of thy wandering from the right path?
