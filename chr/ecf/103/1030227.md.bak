<span id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—How the Apostle Says that God
is Now Seen by Us Through a Glass.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p2"></span>14. I know that wisdom is an
incorporeal substance, and that it is the light by which those things
are seen that are not seen by carnal eyes; and yet a man so great and so
spiritual \[as Paul\] says, “We see now through a glass, in an enigma,
but then face to face.” <span id="fr_960"></span>[961](#fn_960.md) If we
ask what and of what sort is this “glass,” this assuredly occurs to our
minds, that in a glass nothing is discerned but an image. We have
endeavored, then, so to do; in order that we might see in some way or
other by this image which we are, Him by whom we are made, as by a
glass. And this is intimated also in the words of the same apostle: “But
we with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are
transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the
Spirit of the Lord.” <span id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961.md) “Beholding
as in a glass,” <span id="fr_962"></span>[963](#fn_962.md) he has said,
*i.e.* seeing by means of a glass, not looking from a watch-tower: an
ambiguity that does not exist in the Greek language, whence the
apostolic epistles have been rendered into Latin. For in Greek, a
glass, <span id="fr_963"></span>[964](#fn_963.md) in which the images of
things are visible, is wholly distinct in the sound of the word also
from a watch-tower, <span id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964.md) from the
height of which we command a more distant view. And it is quite plain
that the apostle, in using the word “speculantes” in respect to the
glory of the Lord, meant it to come from “speculum,” not from “specula.”
But where he says, “We are transformed into the same image,” he
assuredly means to speak of the image of God; and by calling it “the
same,” he means that very image which we see in the glass, because that
same image is also the glory of the Lord; as he says elsewhere, “For a
man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and
glory of God,” <span id="fr_965"></span>[966](#fn_965.md) —a text already
discussed in the twelfth book. He means, then, by “We are transformed,”
that we are changed from one form to another, and that we pass from a
form that is obscure to a form <span id="page_207">p. 207</span> <span
id="iv.i.xvii.viii-Page_207"></span>that is bright: since the obscure
form, too, is the image of God; and if an image, then assuredly also
“glory,” in which we are created as men, being better than the other
animals. For it is said of human nature in itself, “The man ought not to
cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God.” And this
nature, being the most excellent among things created, is transformed
from a form that is defaced into a form that is beautiful, when it is
justified by its own Creator from ungodliness. Since even in ungodliness
itself, the more the faultiness is to be condemned, the more certainly
is the nature to be praised. And therefore he has added, “from glory to
glory:” from the glory of creation to the glory of justification.
Although these words, “from glory to glory,” may be understood also in
other ways;—from the glory of faith to the glory of sight, from the
glory whereby we are sons of God to the glory whereby we shall be like
Him, because “we shall see Him as He is.” <span
id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966.md) But in that he has added “as from the
Spirit of the Lord,” he declares that the blessing of so desirable a
transformation is conferred upon us by the grace of God.
