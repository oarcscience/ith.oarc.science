<span id="v.iv.i"></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p1"></span> This work is not mentioned in the
*Retractations*, probably because it is a letter, and as such it is
reckoned by Possidius, cap. 7. It is also marked as St. Augustin’s by
its references to his other works, *De Bono Conjugali*, etc. cap. 15.
Ep. to Proba, cap. 23. The date is marked by the recent consecration of
Demetrias, which was in 413. The admonition for which he is thanked by
Juliana, Ep. 188<span id="v.iv.i-p1.1"></span>, may be that against
Pelagianism.

<span id="v.iv.i-p2"></span>An objection has been raised from its
disagreement with the fourth Council of Carthage, an. 398. can. 104,
which excommunicates widows who marry again after consecration, and
pronounces them guilty of adultery, whereas in cap. 10 and 11, the
opinion that such marriages are no marriages, and that they ought to
return to continence, is refuted. The two, however, are not wholly
irreconcileable, as there may be a guilt similar to that of adultery
incurred, and it may be visited with a censure in the form of
excommunication, and yet the marriage may remain valid. The 16th Canon
of Chalcedon imposes such a penalty, with power to the Bishop to relax
it.—*Abridged from the Benedictine Edition*.
