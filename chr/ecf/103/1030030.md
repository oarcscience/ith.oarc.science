<span id="iv.i.iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—The Entire Trinity
Invisible.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.ix-p2"></span>14. Let us therefore say nothing of
those who, with an over carnal mind, have thought the nature of the Word
of God, and the Wisdom, which, “remaining in herself, maketh all things
new,” <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260) whom we call the only Son
of God, not only to be changeable, but also to be visible. For these,
with more audacity than religion, bring a very dull heart to the inquiry
into divine things. For whereas the soul is a spiritual substance, and
whereas itself also was made, yet could not be made <span
id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span id="iv.i.iv.ix-Page_44"></span>by any
other than by Him by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing
is made, <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261) it, although
changeable, is yet not visible; and this they have believed to be the
case with the Word Himself and with the Wisdom of God itself, by which
the soul was made; whereas this Wisdom is not only invisible, as the
soul also is, but likewise unchangeable, which the soul is not. It is in
truth the same unchangeableness in it, which is referred to when it was
said, “Remaining in herself she maketh all things new.” Yet these
people, endeavoring, as it were, to prop up their error in its fall by
testimonies of the divine Scriptures, adduce the words of the Apostle
Paul; and take that, which is said of the one only God, in whom the
Trinity itself is understood, to be said only of the Father, and neither
of the Son nor of the Holy Spirit: “Now unto the King eternal, immortal,
invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and
ever;” <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262) and that other passage,
“The blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can
approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see.” <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263) How these passages are to be
understood, I think we have already discoursed sufficiently. <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264)
