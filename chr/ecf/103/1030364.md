<span id="iv.ii.cxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.cxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 114.—Having Dealt with Faith, We Now
Come to Speak of Hope. Everything that Pertains to Hope is Embraced in
the Lord’s Prayer.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cxvi-p2"></span>Out of this confession of faith, which
is <span id="page_274">p. 274</span> <span
id="iv.ii.cxvi-Page_274"></span>briefly comprehended in the Creed, and
which, carnally understood, is milk for babes, but, spiritually
apprehended and studied, is meat for strong men, springs the good *hope*
of believers; and this is accompanied by a holy *love*. But of these
matters, all of which are true objects of faith, those only pertain to
hope which are embraced in the Lord’s Prayer. For, “Cursed is the man
that trusteth in man” <span id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309.md) is the
testimony of holy writ; and, consequently, this curse attaches also to
the man who trusteth in himself. Therefore, except from God the Lord we
ought to ask for nothing either that we hope to do well, or hope to
obtain as a reward of our good works.
