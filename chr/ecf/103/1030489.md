<span id="v.i.vi-p1"></span> 6. But it is one thing to fight well, which
now is, when the strife <span id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818) of
death is resisted; another thing not to have an adversary, which will
then be, when death, “the last enemy,” <span
id="fr_1819"></span>[1820](#fn_1819) shall be destroyed. For Continence
also itself, when it curbs and restrains lusts, at once both seeks the
good unto the immortality of which we aim, and rejects the evil with
which in this mortality we contend. Of the one it is forsooth the lover
and beholder, but of the other both the enemy and witness: both seeking
what becomes, and fleeing what misbecomes. Assuredly Continence would
not labor in curbing lusts, if we had no wishes contrary to what is
becoming, if there were no opposition on the part of evil lust unto our
good will. The Apostle cries aloud, “I know,” saith he, “that there
dwelleth not in me, that is in my flesh, good. For to will lieth near to
me, but to accomplish good I find not.” <span
id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820) For now good can be done, so far as
that there be no assent given unto evil lust: but good will be
accomplished, when the evil lust itself shall come to an end. And also
the same teacher of the Gentiles cries aloud, “I take pleasure together
with the law of God after the inner man: but I see another law in my
members, warring against the law of my mind.” <span
