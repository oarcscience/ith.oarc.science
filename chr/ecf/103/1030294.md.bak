<span id="iv.ii.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 44.—In Speaking of Sin, the Singular
Number is Often Put for the Plural, and the Plural for the
Singular.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xlvi-p2"></span>But even these latter are frequently
said to die to sin, though undoubtedly they die not to one sin, but to
all the numerous actual sins they have committed in thought, word, or
deed: for the singular number is often put for the plural, as when the
poet says, “They fill its belly with the armed soldier,” <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[1161](#fn_1160.md) though in the case here referred to
there were many soldiers concerned. And we read in our own Scriptures:
“Pray to the Lord, that He take away the serpent from us.” <span
id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161.md) He does not say *serpents* though
the people were suffering from many; and so in other cases. When, on the
other hand, the original sin is expressed in the plural number, as when
we say that infants are baptized for the remission of *sins*, instead of
saying for the remission of *sin*, this is the converse figure of
speech, by which the plural number is put in place of the singular; as
in the Gospel it is said of the death of Herod, “for they are dead which
sought the young child’s life,” <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162.md) instead of saying, “he is dead.”
And in Exodus: “They have made them,” Moses says, “gods of gold,” <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163.md) though they had made only one calf,
of which they said: “These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up
out of the land of Egypt,” <span id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164.md)
—here, too, putting the plural in place of the singular.
