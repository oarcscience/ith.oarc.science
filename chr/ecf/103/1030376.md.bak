<span id="iv.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—How It Often Happens that a
Discourse Which Gives Pleasure to the Hearer is Distasteful to the
Speaker; And What Explanation is to Be Offered of that Fact.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p2"></span>3. But as regards the idea thus
privately entertained by yourself in such efforts, I <span
id="page_284">p. 284</span> <span id="iv.iii.iii-Page_284"></span>would
not have you to be disturbed by the consideration that you have often
appeared to yourself to be delivering a poor and wearisome discourse.
For it may very well be the case that the matter has not so presented
itself to the person whom you were trying to instruct, but that what you
were uttering seemed to you to be unworthy of the ears of others, simply
because it was your own earnest desire that there should be something
better to listen to. Indeed with me, too, it is almost always the fact
that my speech displeases myself. For I am covetous of something better,
the possession of which I frequently enjoy within me before I commence
to body it forth in intelligible words: <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md) and then when my capacities of
expression prove inferior to my inner apprehensions, I grieve over the
inability which my tongue has betrayed in answering to my heart. For it
is my wish that he who hears me should have the same complete
understanding of the subject which I have myself; and I perceive that I
fail to speak in a manner calculated to effect that, and that this
arises mainly from the circumstance that the intellectual apprehension
diffuses itself through the mind with something like a rapid flash,
whereas the utterance is slow, and occupies time, and is of a vastly
different nature, so that, while this latter is moving on, the
intellectual apprehension has already withdrawn itself within its secret
abodes. Yet, in consequence of its having stamped certain impressions of
itself in a marvellous manner upon the memory, these prints endure with
the brief pauses of the syllables; <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) and as the outcome of these same
impressions we form intelligible signs, <span
id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md) which get the name of a certain
language, either the Latin, or the Greek, or the Hebrew, or some other.
And these signs may be objects of thought, or they may also be actually
uttered by the voice. On the other hand however, the impressions
themselves are neither Latin, nor Greek, nor Hebrew, nor peculiar to any
other race whatsoever, but are made good in the mind just as looks are
in the body. For anger is designated by one word in Latin, by another in
Greek, and by different terms in other languages, according to their
several diversities. But the look of the angry man is neither
(peculiarly) Latin nor (peculiarly) Greek. Thus it is that when a person
says *Iratus sum*, <span id="fr_1337"></span>[1338](#fn_1337.md) he is not
understood by every nation, but only by the Latins; whereas, if the mood
of his mind when it is kindling to wrath comes forth upon the face and
affects the look, all who have the individual within their view
understand that he is angry. But, again, it is not in our power to bring
out those impressions which the intellectual apprehension stamps upon
the memory, and to hold them forth, as it were, to the perception of the
hearers by means of the sound of the voice, in any manner parallel to
the clear and evident form in which the look appears. For those former
are within in the mind, while this latter is without in the body.
Wherefore we have to surmise how far the sound of our mouth must be from
representing that stroke of the intelligence, seeing that it does not
correspond even with the impression produced upon the memory. Now, it is
a common occurrence with us that, in the ardent desire to effect what is
of profit to our hearer, our aim is to express ourselves to him exactly
as our intellectual apprehension is at the time, when, in the very
effort, we are failing in the ability to speak; and then, because this
does not succeed with us, we are vexed, and we pine in weariness as if
we were applying ourselves to vain labors; and, as the result of this
very weariness, our discourse becomes itself more languid and pointless
even than it was when it first induced such a sense of tediousness.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p7"></span>4. But ofttimes the earnestness of those
who are desirous of hearing me shows me that my utterance is not so
frigid as it seems to myself to be. From the delight, too, which they
exhibit, I gather that they derive some profit from it. And I occupy
myself sedulously with the endeavor not to fail in putting before them a
service in which I perceive them to take in such good part what is put
before them. Even, so, on your side also, the very fact that persons who
require to be instructed in the faith are brought so frequently to you,
ought to help you to understand that your discourse is not displeasing
to others as it is displeasing to yourself; and you ought not to
consider yourself unfruitful, simply because you do not succeed in
setting forth in such a manner as you desire the things which you
discern; for, perchance, you may be just as little able to discern them
in the way you wish. For in this life who sees except as “in an enigma
and through a glass”? <span id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338.md) Neither
is love itself of might sufficient to rend the darkness of the flesh,
and penetrate into that eternal calm from which even things which pass
away derive the light in which they shine. But inasmuch as day by day
the good are making advances towards the vision of that day, in<span
id="page_285">p. 285</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iii-Page_285"></span>dependent of the rolling sky, <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md) and without the invasion of the
night, “which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered
into the heart of man,” <span id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340.md) there
is no greater reason why our discourse should become valueless in our
own estimate, when we are engaged in teaching the uninstructed, than
this,—namely, that it is a delight to us to discern in an extraordinary
fashion, and a weariness to speak in an ordinary. And in reality we are
listened to with much greater satisfaction, indeed, when we ourselves
also have pleasure in the same work; for the thread of our address is
affected by the very joy of which we ourselves are sensible, and it
proceeds from us with greater ease and with more acceptance.
Consequently, as regards those matters which are recommended as articles
of belief, the task is not a difficult one to lay down injunctions, with
respect to the points at which the narration should be commenced and
ended, or with respect to the method in which the narration is to be
varied, so that at one time it may be briefer, at another more
lengthened, and yet at all times full and perfect; and, again, with
respect to the particular occasions on which it may be right to use the
shorter form, and those on which it will be proper to employ the longer.
But as to the means by which all is to be done, so that every one may
have pleasure in his work when he catechises (for the better he succeeds
in this the more attractive will he be),—that is what requires the
greatest consideration. And yet we have not far to seek for the precept
which will rule in this sphere. For if, in the matter of carnal means,
God loves a cheerful giver, <span id="fr_1341"></span>[1342](#fn_1341.md)
how much more so in that of the spiritual? But our security that this
cheerfulness may be with us at the seasonable hour, is something
dependent upon the mercy of Him who has given us such precepts.
Therefore, in accordance with my understanding of what your own wish is,
we shall discuss in the first place the subject of the method of
narration, then that of the duty of delivering injunction and
exhortation, and afterwards that of the attainment of the said
cheerfulness, so far as God may furnish us with the ideas.
