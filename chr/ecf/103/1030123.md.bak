id="iv.i.x.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—There are Three Things in Love,
as It Were a Trace of the Trinity.</span>

<span id="iv.i.x.xi-p2"></span>14. But what is love or charity, which
divine Scripture so greatly praises and proclaims, except the love of
good? But love is *of* some one that loves, and *with* love something
*is* loved. Behold, then, there are three things: he that loves, and
that which is loved, and love. What, then, is love, except a certain
life which couples or seeks to couple together some two things, namely,
him that loves, and that which is loved? And this is so even in outward
and carnal loves. But that we may drink in something more pure and
clear, let us tread down the flesh and ascend to the mind. What does the
mind love in a friend except the mind? There, then, also are three
things: he that loves, and that which is loved, and love. It remains to
ascend also from hence, and to seek those things which are above, as far
as is given to man. But here for a little while let our purpose rest,
not that it may think itself to have found already what it seeks; but
just as usually the place has first to be found where anything is to be
sought, while the thing itself is not yet found, but we have only found
already where to look for it; so let it suffice to have said thus much,
that we may have, as it were, the hinge of some starting-point, whence
to weave the rest of our discourse.
