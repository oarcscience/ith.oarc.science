<span id="iv.ii.lxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 59.—The Bodies Assumed by Angels
Raise a Very Difficult, and Not Very Useful, Subject of
Discussion.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxi-p2"></span>Further, who will tell with what sort of
bodies it was that the angels appeared to men, making themselves not
only visible, but tangible; and again, how it is that, not through
material bodies, but by spiritual power, they present visions not to the
bodily eyes, but to the spiritual eyes of the mind, or speak something
not into the ear from without, but from within the soul of the man, they
themselves being stationed there too, as it is written in the prophet,
“And the angel that spake in me said unto me” <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197) (he does not say, “that spake to
me,” but “that spake *in* me”); or appear to men in sleep, and make
communications through dreams, as we read in the Gospel, “Behold, the
angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying”? <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198) For these methods of communication
seem to imply that the angels have not tangible bodies, and make it a
very difficult question to solve how the patriarchs washed their
feet, <span id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199) and how it was that
Jacob wrestled with the angel in a way so unmistakeably material. <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200) To ask questions like these, and to
make such guesses as we can at the answers, is a useful exercise for the
intellect, if the discussion be kept within proper bounds, and if we
avoid the error of supposing ourselves to know what we do not know. For
what is the necessity for affirming, or denying, or defining with
accuracy on these subjects, and others like them, when we may without
blame be entirely ignorant of them?
