<span id="v.viii.xviii-p1"></span> 17. Now this election the Apostle
demonstrating to be, not of merits going before in good works, but
election of grace, saith thus: “And in this time a remnant by election
of grace is saved. But if by grace, then is it no more of works,
otherwise grace is no more grace.” <span
id="fr_2671"></span>[2672](#fn_2671.md) This is election of grace; that is,
election in which through the grace of God men are elected: this, I say,
is election of grace which goes before all good merits of men. For if it
be to any good merits that it is given, then is it no more gratuitously
given, but is paid as a debt, and consequently is not truly called
grace; where “reward,” as the same Apostle saith, “is not imputed as
grace, but as debt.” <span id="fr_2672"></span>[2673](#fn_2672.md) Whereas
if, that it may be true grace, that is, gratuitous, it find nothing in
man to which it is due of merit, (which thing is well understood in that
saying, “Thou wilt save them for nothing,” <span
id="fr_2673"></span>[2674](#fn_2673) .md) then assuredly itself gives the
merits, not to merits is given. Consequently it goes before even faith,
from which it is that all good works begin. “For the just,” as is
written, “shall live by faith.” <span
id="fr_2674"></span>[2675](#fn_2674.md) But, moreover, grace not only
assists the just, but also justifies the ungodly. And therefore even
when it does aid the just and seems to be rendered to his merits, not
even then does it cease to be grace, because that which it aids it did
itself bestow. With a view therefore to this grace, which precedes all
good merits of man, not only was Christ put to death by the ungodly, but
“died for the ungodly.” <span id="fr_2675"></span>[2676](#fn_2675.md) And
ere that He died, He elected the Apostles, not of course then just, but
to be justified: to whom He saith, “I have chosen you out of the world.”
For to whom He said, “Ye are not of the world,” and then, lest they
should account themselves never to have been of the world, presently
added, “But I have chosen you out of the world;” assuredly that they
should not be of the world was by His own election of them conferred
upon them. Wherefore, if it had been through their own righteousness,
not through His grace, that they were elected, they would not have been
chosen out of the world, because they would already not be of the world
if already they were just. And again, if the reason why they were
elected was, that they were already just, they had already first chosen
the Lord. For who can be righteous but by choosing righteousness? “But
the end of the law is Christ, for righteousness is to every one that
believeth. <span id="fr_2676"></span>[2677](#fn_2676.md) Who is made unto
us wisdom of God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
that, as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the
Lord.” <span id="fr_2677"></span>[2678](#fn_2677.md) He then is Himself our
righteousness.
