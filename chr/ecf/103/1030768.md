<span id="v.vii.xxxvii-p1"></span> 36. Since these things are so, suffer
me awhile, holy brother, (for the Lord giveth me through thee great
boldness,) to address these same our sons and brethren whom I know with
what love thou together with us dost travail in birth withal, until the
Apostolic discipline be formed in them. O servants of God, soldiers of
Christ, is it thus ye dissemble the plottings of our most crafty foe,
who fearing your good fame, that so goodly odor of Christ, lest good
souls should say, “We will run after the odor of thine ointments,” <span
id="fr_2591"></span>[2592](#fn_2591.md) and so should escape his snares,
and in every way desiring to obscure it with his own stenches, hath
dispersed on every side so many hypocrites under the garb of monks,
strolling about the provinces, no where sent, no where fixed, no where
standing, no where sitting. Some hawking about limbs of martyrs, if
indeed of martyrs; others magnifying their fringes and
phylacteries; <span id="fr_2592"></span>[2593](#fn_2592.md) others with a
lying story, how they have heard say that their parents or kinsmen are
alive in this or that country, and therefore be they on their way to
them: and all asking, all exacting, either the costs of their lucrative
want, or the price of their pretended sanctity. And in the meanwhile
wheresoever they be found out in their evil deeds, or in whatever way
they become notorious, under the general name of monks, your purpose is
blasphemed, a purpose so good, so holy, that in Christ’s name we desire
it, as through other lands so through all Africa, to grow and flourish.
Then are ye not inflamed with godly jealousy? Does not your heart wax
hot within you, and in your meditation a fire kindle, <span
id="fr_2593"></span>[2594](#fn_2593.md) that these men’s evil works ye
should pursue with good works, that ye should cut off from them occasion
of a foul trafficking, by which your estimation is hurt, and a
stumbling-block put before the weak? Have mercy then and have
compassion, and show to mankind that ye are not seeking in ease a ready
subsistence, but through the strait and narrow way of this purpose, are
seeking the kingdom of God. Ye have the same cause which the Apostle
had, to cut off occasion from them which seek occasion, that they who by
their stinks are suffocated, by your good odor may be refreshed.
