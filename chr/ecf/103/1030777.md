<span id="v.viii.iii-p1"></span> 2. The patience of man, which is right
and laudable and worthy of the name of virtue, is understood to be that
by which we tolerate evil things with an even mind, that we may not with
a mind uneven desert good things, through which we may arrive at better.
Wherefore the impatient, while they will not suffer ills, effect not a
deliverance from ills, but only the suffering of heavier ills. Whereas
the patient who choose rather by not committing to bear, than by not
bearing <span id="page_528">p. 528</span> <span
id="v.viii.iii-Page_528"></span>to commit, evil, both make lighter what
through patience they suffer, and also escape worse ills in which
through impatience they would be sunk. But those good things which are
great and eternal they lose not, while to the evils which be temporal
and brief they yield not: because “the sufferings of this present time
are not worthy to be compared,” as the Apostle says, “with the future
glory that shall be revealed in us.” <span

temporal and light tribulation doth in inconceivable manner work for us
an eternal weight of glory.” <span id="fr_2630"></span>[2631](#fn_2630)
