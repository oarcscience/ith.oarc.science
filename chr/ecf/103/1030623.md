<span id="v.iv.xi-p1"></span> 10. Nor, because I called Ruth blessed,
Anna more blessed, in that the former married twice, the latter, being
soon widowed of her one husband, so lived long, do you straightway also
think that you are better than Ruth. Forsooth different in the times of
the Prophets was the dispensation of holy females, whom obedience, not
lust, forced to marry, for the propagation of the people of God, <span
id="fr_2241"></span>[2242](#fn_2241.md) that in them Prophets of Christ
might be sent beforehand; whereas the People itself also, by those
things which in figure happened among them, whether in the case of those
who knew, or in the case of those who knew not those things, was nothing
else than a Prophet of Christ, of whom should be born the Flesh also of
Christ. In order therefore for the propagation of that people, he was
accounted accursed by sentence of the Law, whoso raised not up seed in
Israel. <span id="fr_2242"></span>[2243](#fn_2242.md) Whence also holy
women were kindled, not by lust of sensual intercourse, but by piety of
bearing; so that we most rightly believe of them that they would not
have sought sensual intercourse, in case a family could have come by any
other means. And to the husbands was allowed the use of several wives
living; and that the cause of this was not lust of the flesh, but
forethought of begetting, is shown by the fact, that, as it was lawful
for holy men to have several wives living, it was not likewise lawful
for holy women to have intercourse with several husbands living; in that
they would be by so much the baser, by how much the more they sought
what would not add to their fruitfulness. Wherefore holy Ruth, not
having seed such as at that time was necessary in Israel, on the death
of her husband sought another of whom to have it. Therefore than this
one twice married, Anna once married a widow was on this account more
blessed, in that she attained also to be a prophetess of Christ;
concerning whom we are to believe, that, although she had no sons,
(which indeed Scripture by keeping silence hath left uncertain,) yet,
had she by that Spirit foreseen that Christ would immediately come of a
virgin, by Which she was enabled to recognize Him even as a child:
whence, with good reason, even without sons, (that is, assuming she had
none,) she refused a second marriage: in that she knew that now was the
time wherein Christ were better served, not by duty of bearing, but by
zeal of containing: not by fruitfulness of married womb, but by chastity
<span id="page_445">p. 445</span> <span id="v.iv.xi-Page_445"></span>of
widowed conduct. But if Ruth also was aware that by her flesh was
propagated a seed, whereof Christ should hereafter have flesh, and by
marrying set forth her ministering to this knowledge, I dare not any
longer say that the widowhood of Anna was more blessed than her
fruitfulness.
