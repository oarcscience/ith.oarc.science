<span id="iv.i.xvi.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—How the Image of God in the
Mind is Renewed Until the Likeness of God is Perfected in It in
Blessedness.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xvii-p2"></span>23. Certainly this renewal does not
take place in the single moment of conversion itself, as that renewal in
baptism takes place in a single moment by the remission of all sins; for
not one, be it ever so small, remains unremitted. But as it is one thing
to be free from fever, and another to grow strong again from the
infirmity which the fever produced; and one thing again to pluck out of
the body a weapon thrust into it, and another to heal the wound thereby
made by a prosperous cure; so the first cure is to remove the cause of
infirmity, and this is wrought by the forgiving of all sins; but the
second cure is to heal the infirmity itself, and this takes place
gradually by making progress in the renewal of that image: which two
things are plainly shown in the Psalm, where we read, “Who forgiveth all
thine iniquities,” which takes place in baptism; and then follows, “and
healeth all thine infirmities;” <span id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916)
and this takes place by daily additions, while this image is being
renewed. <span id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917) And the apostle has
spoken of this most expressly, saying, “And though our outward man
perish, yet the inner man is renewed day by day.” <span
id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918) And “it is renewed in the knowledge of
God, *i.e.* in righteousness and true holiness,” according to the
testimonies of the apostle cited a little before. He, then, who is day
by day renewed by making progress in the knowledge of God, and in
righteousness and true holiness, transfers his love from things temporal
to things eternal, from things visible to things intelligible, from
things carnal to things spiritual; and diligently perseveres in bridling
and lessening his desire for the former, and in binding himself by love
to the latter. And he does this in proportion as he is helped by God.
For it is the sentence of God Himself, “Without me ye can do
nothing.” <span id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919) And when the last day
of life shall have found any one holding fast faith in the Mediator in
such progress and growth as this, he will be welcomed by the holy
angels, to be led to God, whom he has worshipped, and to be made perfect
by Him; and so will receive in the end of the world an incorruptible
body, in order not to punishment, but to glory. For the likeness of God
will then be perfected in this image, when the sight of God shall be
perfected. And of this the Apostle Paul speaks: “Now we see through a
glass, in an enigma, but then face to face.” <span
id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920) And again: “But we with open face,
beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same
image, from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921) And this is what happens from day to
day in those that make good progress.

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xvii-p4"></span> \[Justification is instantaneous:
sanctification is gradual. Baptism is the sign, not the cause, of the
former. “As many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized
with reference to (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.xvi.xvii-p4.1"></span>εἰς</span>) his death;” and “are intombed
with him by the baptism that has reference to (<span class="Greek"><span

id="iv.i.xvi.xvii-p4.4"></span>. According to St. Paul, baptism supposes
a trust in the atonement of Christ, and is a seal of it. In saying that
“the forgiveness of all thine iniquity takes place in baptism,” Augustin
is liable to be understood as teaching the efficiency of baptism in
*producing* forgiveness. This is the weak side of the Post Nicene
soteriology.—W.G.T.S.\]
