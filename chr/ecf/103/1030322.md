<span id="iv.ii.lxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 72.—There are Many Kinds of Alms,
the Giving of Which Assists to Procure Pardon for Our Sins.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxiv-p2"></span>And on this principle of
interpretation, our Lord’s saying, “Give alms of such things as ye have,
and, behold, all things are clean unto you,” <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231) applies to every useful act that a
man does in mercy. Not only, then, the man who gives food to the hungry,
drink to the thirsty, clothing to the naked, hospitality to the
stranger, shelter to the fugitive, who visits the sick and the
imprisoned, ransoms the captive, assists the weak, leads the blind,
comforts the sorrowful, heals the sick, puts the wanderer on the right
path, gives advice to the perplexed, and supplies the wants of the
needy,—not this man only, but the man who pardons the sinner also gives
alms; and the man who corrects with blows, or restrains by any kind of
discipline one over whom he has power, and who at the same time forgives
from the heart the sin by which he was injured, or prays that it may be
forgiven, is also a giver of alms, not only in that he forgives, or
prays for forgiveness for the sin, but also in that he rebukes and
corrects the sinner: for in this, too, he shows mercy. Now much good is
bestowed upon unwilling recipients, when their advantage and not their
pleasure is consulted; and they themselves <span id="page_261">p.
261</span> <span id="iv.ii.lxxiv-Page_261"></span>frequently prove to be
their own enemies, while their true friends are those whom they take for
their enemies, and to whom in their blindness they return evil for good.
(A Christian, indeed, is not permitted to return evil even for
evil. <span id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232) ) And thus there are
many kinds of alms, by giving of which we assist to procure the pardon
of our sins.
