<span id="v.iii.xxii-p1"></span> 21. Here some one will say, What has
this to do with holy virginity, or perpetual continence, the setting
forth of which was undertaken in this discourse? To whom I make answer
in the first place, what I mentioned above, that the glory of that
greater good is greater from the fact that, in order to obtain it, the
good of married life is surmounted, not the sin of marriage shunned.
Otherwise it would be enough for perpetual continence, not to be
specially praised, but only not to be blamed: if it were maintained on
this account, because it was a crime to wed. In the next place, because
it is not by human judgment, but by authority of Divine Scripture, that
men must be exhorted unto so excellent a gift, we must plead not in a
common-place manner, or merely by the way, that divine Scripture itself
seem not to any one in any matter to have lied. For they discourage
rather than exhort holy virgins, who compel them to continue so by
passing sentence on marriage. For whence can they feel sure that that is
true, which is written, “And he, who gives her not in marriage, does
better:” <span id="fr_2059"></span>[2060](#fn_2059) if they think that
false, which yet is written close above, “Both he, who gives his virgin,
does well?” But, if they shall without all doubt have believed Scripture
speaking of the good of marriage, confirmed by the same most true
authority of the divine oracle, they will hasten beyond unto their own
better part with glow<span id="page_424">p. 424</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxii-Page_424"></span>ing and confident eagerness. Wherefore
we have already spoken enough for the business which we have taken in
hand, and, so far as we could, have shown, that neither that saying of
the Apostle, “But I think that this is good by reason of the present
necessity,” <span id="fr_2060"></span>[2061](#fn_2060) is so to be
understood, as though in this life holy virgins are better than faithful
women married, but are equal in the kingdom of heaven, and in a future
life: nor that other, where he saith of such as wed, “But such shall
have tribulation of the flesh, but I spare you;” <span
id="fr_2061"></span>[2062](#fn_2061) is to be so understood, as though
he chose rather to be silent on, than to speak of, the sin and
condemnation of marriage. Forsooth two errors, contrary the one to the
other, have, through not understanding them, taken hold of each one of
these two sentences. For that concerning the present necessity they
interpret in their own favor, who contend to equal such as wed to such
as wed not: but this, where it is said, “But I spare you,” they who
presume to condemn such as wed. But we, according to the faith and sound
doctrine of holy Scriptures, both say that marriage is no sin, and yet
set its good not only below virginal, but also below widowed continence;
and say that the present necessity of married persons is an hindrance to
their desert, not indeed unto life eternal, but unto an excellent glory
and honor, which is reserved for perpetual continence: and that at this
time marriage is not expedient save for such as contain not; and that on
the tribulation of the flesh, which cometh from the affection of the
flesh, without which marriages of incontinent persons cannot be, the
Apostle neither wished to be silent, as forewarning what was true, nor
to unfold more fully, as sparing man’s weakness.
