<span id="iv.i.xi.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—We Conceive and Beget the Word
Within, from the Things We Have Beheld in the Eternal Truth. The Word,
Whether of the Creature or of the Creator, is Conceived by Love.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xi.vii-p2"></span>12. We behold, then, by the sight of
the mind, in that eternal truth from which all things temporal are made,
the form according to which we are, and according to which we do
anything by true and right reason, either in ourselves, or in things
corporeal; and we have the true knowledge of things, thence conceived,
as it were as a word within us, and by speaking we beget it from within;
nor by being born does it depart from us. And when we speak to others,
we apply to the word, remaining within us, the ministry of the voice or
of some bodily sign, that by some kind of sensible remembrance some
similar thing may be wrought also in the mind of him that
hears,—similar, I say, to that which does not depart from the mind of
him that speaks. We do nothing, therefore, through the members of the
body in our words and actions, by which the behavior of men is either
approved or blamed, which we do not anticipate by a word uttered within
ourselves. For no one willingly does anything, which he has not first
said in his heart.

<span id="iv.i.xi.vii-p3"></span>13. And this word is conceived by love,
either of the creature or of the Creator, that is, either of changeable
nature or of unchangeable truth. <span id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md)

<span id="iv.i.xi.vii-p4"></span> \[The inward production of a thought
in the finite essence of the human spirit which is expressed outwardly
in a spoken word, is analogous to the eternal generation of the Eternal
Wisdom in the infinite essence of God expressed in the Eternal Word.
Both are alike, in that something spiritual issues from something
spiritual, without division or diminution of substance. But a thought of
the human mind is not an objective thing or substance; while the Eternal
Word is.—W.G.T.S.\]
