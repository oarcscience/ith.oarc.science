<span id="v.vii.xxxviii"></span>

<span id="v.vii.xxxviii-p1"></span> 37. We are not binding heavy burdens
and laying them upon your shoulders, while we with a finger will not
touch them. Seek out, and acknowledge the labor of our occupations, and
in some of us the infirmities of our bodies also, and in the Churches
which we serve, that custom now grown up, that they do not suffer us to
have time ourselves for those works to which we exhort you. For though
we might say, “Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? Who
planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth a
flock, and partaketh not of the milk of the flock?” <span
id="fr_2594"></span>[2595](#fn_2594.md) yet I call our Lord Jesus, in Whose
name I fearlessly say these things, for a witness upon my soul, that so
far as it concerns mine own convenience, I would much rather every day
at certain hours, as much as is appointed by rule in well-governed
monasteries, do some work with my hands, and have the remaining hours
free for reading and praying, or some work pertaining to Divine
Letters, <span id="fr_2595"></span>[2596](#fn_2595.md) than have to hear
these most annoying perplexities of other men’s causes about secular
matters, which we must either by adjudication bring to an end, or by
intervention cut short. Which troubles the same Apostle hath fastened us
withal, (not by his own sentence, but by His who spake through him,)
while yet we do not read that he had to put up with them himself: indeed
his was not the sort of work to admit of it, while running to and fro in
his Apostleship. Nor hath he said, “If then ye have secular law-suits,
bring them before us;” or, “Appoint us to judge them;” but, “Them which
are contemptible in the Church, these,” saith he, “put ye in place. To
your abashment I say it: is it so that there is not among you any wise
man who can judge between his brother, but brother goeth to law with
brother, and that before <span id="page_522">p. 522</span> <span
id="v.vii.xxxviii-Page_522"></span>infidels?” <span
id="fr_2596"></span>[2597](#fn_2596.md) So then wise believers and saints,
having their stated abode in the different places, not those who were
running hither and hither on the business of the Gospel, were the
persons whom he willed to be charged with examination of such affairs.
Whence it is no where written of him that he on any occasion gave up his
time to such matters; from which we are not able to excuse ourselves,
even though we be contemptible; because he willed even such to be put in
place, in case there were lack of wise men, rather than have the affairs
of Christians to be brought into the public courts. Which labor,
however, we not without consolation of the Lord take upon us, for hope
of eternal life, that we may bring forth fruit with patience. For we are
servants unto His Church, and most of all to the weaker members,
whatsoever members we in the same body may chance to be. I pass by other
innumerable ecclesiastical cares, which perchance no man credits but he
who hath experienced the same. Therefore we do not bind heavy burdens
and place them on your shoulders, while we ourselves touch them not so
much as with a finger; since indeed if with safety to our office we
might, (He seeth it, Who tries our hearts!) we would rather do these
things which we exhort you to do, than the things which we ourselves are
forced to do. True it is, to all both us and you, while according to our
degree and office we labor, both the way is strait in labor and toil;
and yet, while we rejoice in hope, His yoke is easy and His burden
light, Who hath called us unto rest, Who passed forth before us from the
vale of tears, where not Himself either was without pressure of griefs.
If ye be our brethren, if our sons, if we be your fellow-servants, or
rather in Christ your servants, hear what we admonish, acknowledge what
we enjoin, take what we dispense. But if we be Pharisees, binding heavy
burdens and laying them on your shoulders; <span
id="fr_2597"></span>[2598](#fn_2597.md) yet do ye the things we say, even
though ye disapprove the things we do. But to us it is a very small
thing that we be judged by you, <span
id="fr_2598"></span>[2599](#fn_2598.md) or of any human assize. <span
id="fr_2599"></span>[2600](#fn_2599.md) Of how near and dear <span
id="fr_2600"></span>[2601](#fn_2600.md) charity is our care on your behalf,
let Him look into it Who hath given what we may offer to be looked into
by His eyes. In fine: think what ye will of us: Paul the Apostle enjoins
and beseeches you in the Lord, that with silence, that is, quietly and
obediently ordered, ye do work and eat your own bread. <span
id="fr_2601"></span>[2602](#fn_2601.md) Of him, as I suppose, ye believe no
evil, and He who by him doth speak, on Him have ye believed.
