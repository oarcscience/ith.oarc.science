<span id="v.i.xx-p1"></span> 20. There are therefore in us evil desires,
by consenting not unto which we live not ill: there are in us lusts of
sins, by obeying not which we perfect not evil, but by having them do
not as yet perfect good. The Apostle shows both, that neither is good
here perfected, where evil is so lusted after, nor evil here perfected,
whereas such lust is not obeyed. The one forsooth he shows, where he
says, “To will is present with me, but to perfect good is not;” <span
id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md) the other, where he says, “Walk in
the Spirit, and perfect not the lusts of the flesh.” <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md) For neither in the former place
doth he say that to do good is not with him, but “to perfect,” nor here
doth he say, Have not “lusts of the flesh,” but “perfect not.” Therefore
there take place in us evil lusts, when that pleases which is not
lawful; but they are not perfected, when evil lusts are restrained by
the mind serving the Law of God. And good takes place, when that, which
wrongly pleases, takes not place through the good delight prevailing.
But the perfection of good is not fulfilled, so long as by the flesh
serving the law of sin, evil lust entices, and, although it be
restrained, is yet moved. For there would be no need for it to be
restrained, were it not moved. There will be at some time also the
perfection of good, when the destruction of evil: the one will be
highest, the other will be no more. And if we think that this is to be
hoped for in this mortal state, we are deceived. For it shall be then,
when death shall not be; and it shall be there, where shall be life
eternal. For in that world, <span id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md)
and in that kingdom, there shall be highest good, no evil: when there
shall be, and where there shall be, highest love of wisdom, no labor of
continence. Therefore the flesh is not evil, if it be void of evil, that
is, of fault, whereby man was rendered faulty, not made ill, but himself
making. For on either part, that is, both soul and body, being made good
by the good God, himself made the evil, whereby he was made evil. From
the guilt of which evil being already also set free through
forgiveness, <span id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877.md) that he may not
think what he hath done to be light, he yet wars with his own fault
through continence. But far be it that there be any faults in such as
reign in that peace which shall be hereafter; since in this state of war
there are lessened daily in such as make progress, not sins only, but
the very lusts also, with which, by not consenting, we strive, and by
consenting unto which we sin.
