<span id="iv.ii.cxxiv-p2"></span>But now there must be an end at last to
this volume. And it is for yourself to judge whether you should call it
a hand-book, or should use it as such. I, however, thinking that your
zeal in Christ ought not to be despised, and believing and hoping all
good of you in dependence on our Redeemer’s help, and loving you very
much as one of the members of His body, have, to the best of my ability,
written this book for you on *Faith, Hope, and Love*. May its value be
equal to its length.
