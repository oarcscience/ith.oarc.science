<span id="iv.i.xv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—Of the Same Subject.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xv.xv-p2"></span>19. It is not then difficult to see that
the devil was conquered, when he who was slain by Him rose again. It is
something more, and more profound of comprehension, to see that the
devil was conquered when he thought himself to have conquered, that is,
when Christ was slain. For then that blood, since it was His who had no
sin at all, was poured out for the remission of our sins; that, because
the devil deservedly held those whom, as guilty of sin, he bound by the
condition of death, he might deservedly loose them through Him, whom, as
guilty of no sin, the punishment of death undeservedly affected. The
strong man was conquered by this righteousness, and bound with this
chain, that his vessels might be spoiled, <span
id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826) which with himself and his angels had
been vessels of wrath while with him, and might be turned into vessels
of mercy. <span id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827) For the Apostle Paul
tells us, that these words of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself were spoken
from heaven to him when he was first called. For among the other things
which he heard, he speaks also of this as said to him thus: “For I have
appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a
witness both of these things which thou hast seen from me, and of those
things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the
people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open the
eyes of the blind, <span id="page_178">p. 178</span> <span
id="iv.i.xv.xv-Page_178"></span>and to turn them from darkness \[to
light\], and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive
forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified,
and faith that is in me.” <span id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828) And
hence the same apostle also, exhorting believers to the giving of thanks
to God the Father, says: “Who hath delivered us from the power of
darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son: in
whom we have redemption, even the forgiveness of sins.” <span
id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829) In this redemption, the blood of
Christ was given, as it were, as a price for us, by accepting which the
devil was not enriched, but bound: <span
id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830) that we might be loosened from his
bonds, and that he might not with himself involve in the meshes of sins,
and so deliver to the destruction of the second and eternal death, <span
id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831) any one of those whom Christ, free
from all debt, had redeemed by pouring out His own blood unindebtedly;
but that they who belong to the grace of Christ, foreknown, and
predestinated, and elected before the foundation of the world <span
id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832) should only so far die as Christ
Himself died for them, *i.e.* only by the death of the flesh, not of the
spirit.

<span id="iv.i.xv.xv-p7"></span> \[In this representation of Augustin,
the relics of that misconception which appears in the earlier
soteriology, paricularly that of Irenæus, are seen: namely, that the
death of Christ ransoms the sinner from Satan. Certain texts which teach
that redemption delivers from the captivity to sin and Satan, were
interpreted to teach deliverance from the *claims* of Satan. Augustin’s
soteriology is more free from this error than that of Irenæus, yet not
entirely free from it. The doctrine of justification did not obtain its
most consistent and complete statement in the Patristic
church.—W.G.T.S.\]
