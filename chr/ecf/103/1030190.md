<span id="iv.i.xv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—All, on Account of the Sin of
Adam, Were Delivered into the Power of the Devil.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xv.xii-p2"></span>16. By the justice of God in some
sense, the human race was delivered into the power of the devil; the sin
of the first man passing over originally into all of both sexes in their
birth through conjugal union, and the debt of our first parents binding
their whole posterity. This delivering up is first signified in Genesis,
where, when it had been said to the serpent, “Dust shalt thou eat,” it
was said to the man, “Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shall
return.” <span id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813.md) In the words, “Unto
dust shalt thou return,” the death of the body is fore-announced,
because he would not have experienced that either, if he had continued
to the end upright as he was made; but in that it is said to him whilst
still living, “Dust thou art,” it is shown that the whole man was
changed for the worse. For “Dust thou art” is much the same as, “My
spirit shall not always remain in these men, for that they also are
flesh.” <span id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814.md) Therefore it was at that
time shown, that he was delivered to him, in that it had been said to
him, “Dust shall thou eat.” But the apostle declares this more clearly,
where he says: “And you who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in
time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to
the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the
children of unfaithfulness; among whom we also had our conversation in
times past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the
flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as
others.” <span id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815.md) The “children of
unfaithfulness” are the unbelievers; and who is not this before he
becomes a believer? And therefore all men are originally under the
prince of the power of the air, “who worketh in the children of
unfaithfulness.” And that which I have expressed by “originally” is the
same that the apostle expresses when he speaks of themselves who “by
nature” were as others; *viz*. by nature as it has been depraved by sin,
not as it was created upright from the beginning. But the way in which
man was thus delivered into the power of the devil, ought not to be so
understood as if God did this, or commanded it to be done; but that He
only permitted it, yet that justly. For when He abandoned the sin<span
id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span id="iv.i.xv.xii-Page_176"></span>ner,
the author of the sin immediately entered. Yet God did not certainly so
abandon His own creature as not to show Himself to him as God creating
and quickening, and among penal evils bestowing also many good things
upon the evil. For He hath not in anger shut up His tender
mercies. <span id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816.md) Nor did He dismiss man
from the law of His own power, when He permitted him to be in the power
of the devil; since even the devil himself is not separated from the
power of the Omnipotent, as neither from His goodness. For whence do
even the evil angels subsist in whatever manner of life they have,
except through Him who quickens all things? If, therefore, the
commission of sins through the just anger of God subjected man to the
devil, doubtless the remission of sins through the merciful
reconciliation of God rescues man from the devil.
