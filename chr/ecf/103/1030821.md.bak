<span id="v.ix.xix-p1"></span> 18. So then we must confess that the dead
indeed do not know what is doing here, but while it is in doing here:
afterwards, however, they hear it from those who from hence go to them
at their death; not indeed every thing, but what things those are
allowed to make known who are suffered also to remember these things;
and which it is meet for those to hear, whom they inform of the same. It
may be also, that from the Angels, who are present in the things which
are doing here, the dead do hear somewhat, which for each one of them to
hear He judgeth right to Whom all things are subject. For were there not
Angels, who could be present in places both of quick and dead, the Lord
Jesus had not said, “It came to pass also that the poor man died, and
was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom.” <span
id="fr_2751"></span>[2752](#fn_2751.md) Therefore, now here, now there,
were they able to be, who from hence bore thither whom God willed. It
may be also, that the spirits of the dead do learn some things which are
doing here, what things it is necessary that they should know, and what
persons it is necessary should know the same, not only things past or
present, but even future, by the Spirit of God revealing them: like as
not all men, but the Prophets while they lived here did know, nor even
they all things, but only what things to be revealed to them the
providence of God judged meet. Moreover, that some from the dead are
sent to the living, as, on the other hand, Paul from the living was rapt
into Paradise, divine Scripture doth testify. <span
id="fr_2752"></span>[2753](#fn_2752.md) For Samuel the Prophet, appearing
to Saul when living, predicted even what should befall the king: <span
id="fr_2753"></span>[2754](#fn_2753.md) although some think it was not
Samuel himself, that could have been by magical arts evoked, but that
some spirit, meet for so evil works, did figure his semblance: <span
id="fr_2754"></span>[2755](#fn_2754.md) though the book Ecclesiasticus,
which Jesus, son of Sirach, is reputed to have written, and which on
account of some resemblance of style is pronounced to be
Solomon’s, <span id="fr_2755"></span>[2756](#fn_2755.md) contains in the
praise of the Fathers, that Samuel even when dead did prophesy. But if
this book be spoken against from the canon of the Hebrews, <span
id="fr_2756"></span>[2757](#fn_2756.md) (because it is not contained
therein,) what shall we say of Moses, whom certainly we read both in
Deuteronomy to have died, <span id="fr_2757"></span>[2758](#fn_2757.md) and
in the Gospel to have, together with Elias who died not, appeared unto
the living? <span id="fr_2758"></span>[2759](#fn_2758.md)
