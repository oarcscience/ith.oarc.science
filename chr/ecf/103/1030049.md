<span id="iv.i.v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—Great Miracles Wrought by Magic
Arts.</span>

<span id="iv.i.v.viii-p2"></span>12. I see here what may occur to a weak
judgment, namely, why such miracles are wrought also by magic arts; for
the wise men of Pharaoh likewise made serpents, and did other like
things. Yet it is still more a matter of wonder, how it was that the
power of those magicians, which was able to make serpents, when it came
to very small flies, failed altogether. For the lice, by which third
plague the proud people of Egypt were smitten, are very short-lived
little flies; yet there certainly the magicians failed, saying, “This is
the finger of God.” <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379) And hence it
is given us to understand that not even those angels and powers of the
air that transgressed, who have been thrust down into that lowest
darkness, as into a peculiar prison, from their habitation in that lofty
ethereal purity, through whom magic arts have whatever power they have,
can do anything except by power given from above. Now that power is
given either to deceive the deceitful, as it was given against the
Egyptians, and against the magicians also themselves, in order that in
the seducing of those spirits they might seem admirable by whom they
were wrought, but to be condemned by the truth of God; or for the
admonishing of the faithful, lest they should desire to do anything of
the kind as though it were a great thing, for which reason they have
been handed down to us also by the authority of Scripture; or lastly,
for the exercising, proving, and manifesting of the patience of the
righteous. For it was not by any small power of visible miracles that
Job lost all that he had, and both his children and his bodily health
itself. <span id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380)
