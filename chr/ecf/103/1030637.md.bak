<span id="v.iv.xxv-p1"></span> 24. Let the inner ear of the virgin also,
thy holy child, hear these things. I shall see <span
id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283.md) how far she goes before you in the
Kingdom of That King: it is another question. Yet ye have found, mother
and daughter, Him, Whom by beauty of chastity ye ought to please
together, having despised, she all, you second, marriage. Certainly if
there were husbands whom ye had to please, by this time, perhaps, you
would feel ashamed to adorn yourself together with your daughter; now
let it not shame you, to set yourselves to do what may adorn you both
together; because it is not matter of blame, but of glory, that ye be
loved both together by That One. But white and red, feigned and laid on
with paints, ye would not use, even if ye had husbands; not thinking
that they were fit persons for you to deceive, or yourselves such as
ought to deceive; now therefore That King, Who had longed for the beauty
of His Only Spouse, of Whom ye are members, do ye with all truth
together please, together cleave unto; she with virginal chastity, you
with widowed continence, both with spiritual beauty. In which beauty
also her grandmother, and your mother-in-law, who by this time surely
hath grown old, is beautiful together with you. Forsooth whilst charity
carries the vigor of this beauty into things that are before, length of
years causeth not in it a wrinkle. You have with you a holy aged woman,
both in your house and in Christ, whom to consult concerning
perseverance; how you are to fight with this or that temptation, what
you are to do, that it may be the more easily overcome; what safeguard
you are to take, that it may not easily again lay wait; and if there be
any thing of this sort, she teaches you, who is now by time fixed, by
love a well-wisher, by natural affection full of cares, by age secure.
Do you specially, do you in such things consult her, who hath made trial
of what you have made trial of. For your child sings that song, <span
id="fr_2284"></span>[2285](#fn_2284.md) which in the Apocalypse none save
virgins can sing. But for both of you she prays more carefully than for
herself, but she is more full of care for her granddaughter, for whom
there remains a longer space of years to overcome temptations; but you
she sees nearer to her own age, and mother of a daughter of such an age,
as that, had you seen her married, (which now is not lawful, and far be
it from her,) I think you would have blushed to bear children together
with her. How much then is it that now remains to you of a dangerous
age, who are on this account not called a grandmother, in order that
together with your daughter you may be fruitful in offspring of holy
thoughts and works? Therefore not without reason is the grandmother more
full of care for her, for whom you also the mother; because both what
she hath vowed is greater, and the whole of what she hath just now begun
remains to <span id="page_452">p. 452</span> <span
id="v.iv.xxv-Page_452"></span>her. May the Lord hear her prayers, that
ye may holily follow her good deserts, Who in youth gave birth to the
flesh of your husband, <span id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285.md) in old
age travaileth with the heart of your daughter. Therefore do ye all,
alike and with one accord, by conduct please, by prayers press upon,
That One Husband of One Wife, in Whose Body by One Spirit ye are living.
