<span id="iv.ii.xlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 45.—In Adam’s First Sin, Many Kinds
of Sin Were Involved.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xlvii-p2"></span>However, even in that one sin, which
“by one man entered into the world, and so passed upon all men,” <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165.md) and on account of which infants are
baptized, a number of distinct sins may be observed, if it be analyzed
as it were into its separate elements. For there is in it pride, because
man chose to be under his own dominion, rather than under the dominion
of God; and blasphemy, because he did not believe God; and murder, for
he brought death upon himself; and spiritual fornication, for the purity
of the human soul was corrupted by the seducing blandishments of the
serpent; and theft, for man turned to his own use the food he had been
forbidden to touch; and avarice, for he had a craving for more than
should have been sufficient for him; and whatever other sin can be
discovered on careful reflection to be involved in this one admitted
sin.
