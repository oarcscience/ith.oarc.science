<span id="iv.v.v"></span>

<span id="iv.v.v-p1"></span> 5. But you will say, the good will of a
friend towards me, although I cannot see it, yet can I trace it out by
many proofs; but you, what things you will us to believe not being seen,
you have no proofs whereby to show them. In the mean time it is no
slight thing, that you confess that by reason of the clearness of
certain proofs, some things, even such as are not seen, ought to be
believed: for even thus it is agreed, that not all things which are not
seen, are not to be believed; and that saying, “that we ought not to
believe things which we see not,” falls to the ground, cast away, and
refuted. But they are much deceived, who think that we believe in Christ
without any proofs concerning Christ. For what are there clearer proofs
than those things, which we now see to have been foretold and fulfilled?
Wherefore do ye, who think that there are no proofs why ye ought to
believe concerning Christ those things which ye have not seen, give heed
to what things ye see. The Church herself addresses you out of the mouth
of a mother’s love: “I, whom ye view with wonder throughout the whole
world, bearing fruit and increasing, was not once such as ye now behold
me.” But, “In thy Seed shall all nations be blessed.” <span
id="fr_1658"></span>[1659](#fn_1658.md) When God blessed Abraham, He gave
the promise of me; for throughout all nations in the blessing of Christ
am I shed abroad. That Christ is the Seed of Abraham, the order of
successive generations bears witness. Shortly to sum up which, Abraham
begat Isaac, Isaac begat Jacob, Jacob begat twelve sons, of whom sprung
the people Israel. For Jacob himself was called Israel. Among these
twelve sons he begat Judah, whence the Jews have their name, of whom was
born the Virgin Mary, who bore Christ. And, lo, in Christ, that is, in
the seed of Abraham, that all the nations are blessed, ye see and are
amazed: and do ye still fear to believe in Him, in Whom ye ought rather
to have feared not to believe? What? doubt ye, or refuse ye to believe,
the travail of a Virgin, whereas ye ought rather to believe that it was
fitting that so God should be born Man. For this also receive ye to have
been foretold by the Prophet; <span id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659.md)
“Behold, a Virgin shall conceive in the womb, and shall bring forth a
Son, and they shall call His Name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted,
God with us.” Ye will not therefore doubt of a Virgin bringing forth, if
ye be willing to believe of a God being born; leaving not the governance
of the world, and coming unto men in the flesh; unto His Mother bringing
fruitfulness, not taking away maidenhood. For thus behoved it that He
should be born as Man, albeit <span id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660.md)
He was ever <span id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661.md) God, by which
birth He might become a God unto us. Hence again the Prophet says
concerning Him, “Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of
right, the sceptre of Thy Kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and
hated iniquity; therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil
of gladness above Thy fellows.” <span
id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662.md) This anointing is spiritual,
wherewith God anointed God, the Father, that is, the Son: whence called
from the “Chrism,” that is, from the anointing, we know Him as Christ. I
am the Church, concerning whom it is said unto Him in the same Psalm,
and what was future foretold as already done; “There stood at Thy right
hand the Queen, in a vesture of gold, in raiment of divers colors;” that
is, in the mystery of wisdom, “adorned with divers tongues.” There it
said unto me, “Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thine ear, and
forget thy own people and thy father’s house: for the King hath desired
thy beauty: seeing that He is the Lord thy God: and the daughters of
Tyre shall worship Him with gifts, thy face shall all the rich of the
people entreat. All the glory of that King’s daughter is within, in
fringes of gold, with raiment of divers colors. There shall be brought
unto the <span id="page_340">p. 340</span> <span
id="iv.v.v-Page_340"></span>King the maidens after her; her companions
shall be brought unto Thee. They shall be brought with joy and gladness,
they shall be brought into the Temple of the King. Instead of thy
fathers, there are born unto thee sons, thou shall set them as princes
over the whole earth. They shall be mindful of thy name, even from
generation to generation. Therefore shall the people confess unto thee
for ever, and for ever and ever.
