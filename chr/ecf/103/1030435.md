<span id="iv.vi.ix-p1"></span> 8. For that both history of the Old
Testament, and ætiology, and analogy are found in the New Testament, has
been, as I think, sufficiently proved: it remains to show this of
allegory. Our Redeemer Himself in the Gospel uses allegory out of the
Old Testament. “This generation,” saith He, “seeketh a sign, and there
shall not be given it save the sign of Jonas the prophet. For as Jonas
was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly, so also shall the
Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
earth.” <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707) For why should I
speak of the Apostle Paul, who in his first Epistle to the Corinthians
shows that even the very history of the Exodus was an allegory of the
future Christian People. “But I would not that ye should be ignorant,
brethren, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed
through the sea, and were all baptized into Moses, in the cloud, and in
the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the
same spiritual drink; for they drank of the spiritual Rock that followed
with them; and that Rock was Christ. But in the more part of them God
was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. But
these things were figures of us, <span
id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708) that we be not lustful of evil
things, as they also lusted. Neither let us worship idols, as certain of
them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose
up to play. Neither let us commit fornication, as certain of them
committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand men. Neither
let us tempt <span id="page_351">p. 351</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ix-Page_351"></span>Christ, as certain of them tempted, and
perished of serpents. Neither murmur we, as certain of them murmured,
and perished of the destroyer. But all these things happened unto them
in a figure. <span id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709) But they were
written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world have
come.” <span id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710) There is also in the
Apostle a certain allegory, which indeed greatly relates to the cause in
hand, for this reason that they themselves are wont to bring it forward,
and make a display of it in disputing. For the same Paul says to the
Galatians, “For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one of a
bond-maid, and one of a free woman. But he who was of the bond-maid was
born after the flesh: but he who was of the free woman, by promise:
which things were spoken by way of allegory. <span
id="fr_1711"></span>[1712](#fn_1711) For these are the two Testaments,
one of Mount Sinai gendering unto bondage, which is Agar: for Sinai is a
mount in Arabia, which bordereth <span
id="fr_1712"></span>[1713](#fn_1712) upon that Jerusalem which now is,
and is in bondage with her children. But that Jerusalem which is above
is free, which is the mother of us all.” <span
id="fr_1713"></span>[1714](#fn_1713)
