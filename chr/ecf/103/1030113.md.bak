id="iv.i.x.i-p1.1"></span>Preface.—The Conclusion of What Has Been Said
Above. The Rule to Be Observed in the More Difficult Questions of the
Faith.</span>

<span id="iv.i.x.i-p2"></span><span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.x.i-p2.1"></span>We</span> have said elsewhere that those
things are predicated specially in the Trinity as belonging severally to
each person, which are predicated relatively the one to the other, as
Father and Son, and the gift of both, the Holy Spirit; for the Father is
not the Trinity, nor the Son the Trinity, nor the gift the Trinity: but
what whenever each is singly spoken of in respect to themselves, then
they are not spoken of as three in the plural number, but one, the
Trinity itself, as the Father God, the Son God, and the Holy Spirit God;
the Father good, the Son good, and the Holy Spirit good; and the Father
omnipotent, the Son omnipotent, and the Holy Spirit omnipotent: yet
neither three Gods, nor three goods, nor three omnipotents, but one God,
good, omnipotent, the Trinity itself; and whatsoever else is said of
them not relatively in respect to each other, but individually in
respect to themselves. For they are thus spoken of according to essence,
since in them to be is the same as to be great, as to be good, as to be
wise, and whatever else is said of each person individually therein, or
of the Trinity itself, in respect to themselves. And that therefore they
are called three persons, or three substances, not in order that any
difference of essence may be understood, but that we may be able to
answer by some one word, should any one ask what three, or what three
things? And that there is so great an equality in that Trinity, that not
only the Father is not greater than the Son, as regards divinity, but
neither are the Father and Son together greater than the Holy Spirit;
nor is each individual person, whichever it be of the three, less than
the Trinity itself. This is what we have said; and if it is handled and
repeated frequently, it becomes, no doubt, more familiarly known: yet
some limit, too, must be put to the discussion, and we must supplicate
God with most devout piety, that He will open our understanding, and
take away the inclination of disputing, in order that our minds may
discern the essence of the truth, that has neither bulk nor
moveableness. Now, therefore, so far as the Creator Himself aids us in
His marvellous mercy, let us consider these subjects, into which we will
enter more deeply than we entered into those which preceded, although
they are in truth the same; preserving the while this rule, that what
has not yet been made clear to our intellect, be nevertheless not
loosened from the firmness of our faith.
