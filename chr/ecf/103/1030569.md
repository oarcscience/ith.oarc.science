<span id="v.iii.xvi-p1"></span> 15. After that the same Apostle adds,
and says, “Thou art bound to a wife, seek not loosening: thou art loosed
from a wife, seek not a wife.” <span
id="fr_2049"></span>[2050](#fn_2049) Of these two, that, which be set
first, pertains unto command, against which it is not lawful to do. For
it is not lawful to put away a wife, save because of fornication, <span
id="fr_2050"></span>[2051](#fn_2050) as the Lord Himself saith in the
Gospel. But that, which he added, “Thou art loosed from a wife, seek not
a wife,” is a sentence of counsel, not of command; therefore it is
lawful to do, but it is better not to do. Lastly, he added straightway,
“Both if thou shalt have taken a wife, thou hast not sinned; and, if a
virgin shall have been married, she sinneth not.” <span
id="fr_2051"></span>[2052](#fn_2051) But, after that former saying of
his, “Thou art bound to a wife, seek not loosening,” he added not, did
he, “And if thou shalt have loosed, thou hast not sinned?” For he had
already said above, “But to these, who are in marriage, I command, not
I, but the Lord, that the wife depart not from her husband: but, if she
shall have departed, that she remain unmarried, or be reconciled unto
her own husband;” for it may come to pass that she depart, not through
any fault of her own, but of her husband. Then he saith, “And let not
the man put away his wife,” which, nevertheless, he set down of command
of the Lord: nor did he then add, And, if he shall have put her away, he
sinneth not. For this is a command, not to obey which is sin: not a
counsel, which if you shall be unwilling to use, you will obtain less
good, not do any ill. On this account, after he had said, “Thou art
loosed from a wife, seek not a wife;” because he was not giving command,
in order that there be not evil done, but was giving counsel, in order
that there be done what is better: straightway he added, “Both, if thou
shall have taken a wife, thou hast not sinned; and, if a virgin shall
have been married, she sinneth not.”
