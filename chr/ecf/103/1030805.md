<span id="v.ix.iii-p1"></span> 2. But this being the case, how to this
opinion that should not be contrary which the Apostle says, “For we
shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each may
receive according to the things he hath done by the body, <span
id="fr_2709"></span>[2710](#fn_2709.md) whether good or bad;” <span
id="fr_2710"></span>[2711](#fn_2710.md) this, thou signifiest, thou dost
not well see. For this apostolic sentence doth before death admonish to
be done, that which may profit after death; not then, first, when there
is to be now a receiving of that which a person shall have done before
death. True, but this question is thus solved, namely, that there is a
certain kind of life by which is acquired, while one lives in this body,
that it should be possible for these things to be of some help to the
departed; and, consequently, it is “according to the things done by the
body,” that they are aided by the things which shall, after they have
left the body, be religiously done on their behalf. For there are whom
these things aid nothing at all, namely, when <span id="page_540">p.
540</span> <span id="v.ix.iii-Page_540"></span>they are done either for
persons whose merits are so evil, that neither by such things are they
worthy to be aided; or for persons whose merits are so good, that of
such things they have no need as aids. Of the kind of life, therefore,
which each hath led by the body, doth it come, that these things profit
or profit not, whatever are piously done on his behalf when he has left
the body. For touching merit whereby these things profit, if none have
been gotten in this life, it is in vain sought after this life. So it
comes to pass as well that not unmeaningly <span
id="fr_2711"></span>[2712](#fn_2711.md) doth the Church, or care of
friends, bestow upon the departed whatever of religion it shall be able;
as also that, nevertheless, each receiveth “according to the things
which he hath done by the body, whether it be good or bad,” the Lord
rendering unto each according to his works. For, that this which is
bestowed should be capable of profiting him after the body, this was
acquired in that life which he hath led in the body.
