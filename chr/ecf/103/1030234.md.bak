<span id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—How Great is the Unlikeness
Between Our Word and the Divine Word. Our Word Cannot Be or Be Called
Eternal.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p2"></span>Is our word, then, born of our
knowledge only? Do we not say many things also that we do not know? And
say them not with doubt, but thinking them to be true; while if
perchance they are true in respect to the things themselves of which we
speak, they are yet not true in respect to our word, because a word is
not true unless it is born of a thing that is known. In this sense,
then, our word is false, not when we lie, but when we are deceived. And
when we doubt, our word is not yet of the thing of which we doubt, but
it is a word concerning the doubt itself. For although we do not know
whether that is true of which we doubt, yet we do know that we doubt;
and hence, when we say we doubt, we say a word that is true, for we say
what we know. And what, too, of its being possible for us to lie? And
when we do, certainly we both willingly and knowingly have a word that
is false, wherein there is a word that is true, *viz*. that we lie, for
this we know. And when we confess that we have lied, we speak that which
is true; for we say what we know, for we know that we lied. But that
Word which is God, and can do more than we, cannot do this. For it “can
do nothing except what it sees the Father do;” and it “speaks not of
itself,” but it has from the Father all that it <span id="page_214">p.
214</span> <span id="iv.i.xvii.xv-Page_214"></span>speaks, since the
Father speaks it in a special way; and the great might of that Word is
that it cannot lie, because there cannot be there “yea and nay,” <span
id="fr_992"></span>[993](#fn_992.md) but “yea yea, nay nay.” Well, but that
is not even to be called a word, which is not true. I willingly assent,
if so it be. What, then, if our word is true and therefore is rightly
called a word? Is it the case that, as we can speak of sight of sight,
and knowledge of knowledge, so we can speak of essence of essence, as
that Word of God is especially spoken of, and is especially to be spoken
of? Why so? Because to us, to be is not the same as to know; since we
know many things which in some sense live by memory, and so in some
sense die by being forgotten: and so, when those things are no longer in
our knowledge, yet we still are: and while our knowledge has slipped
away and perished out of our mind, we are still alive.

<span id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p4"></span>25. In respect to those things also
which are so known that they can never escape the memory, because they
are present, and belong to the nature of the mind itself,—as, *e.g.*,
the knowing that we are alive (for this continues so long as the mind
continues; and because the mind continues always, this also continues
always);—I say, in respect to this and to any other like instances, in
which we are the rather to contemplate the image of God, it is difficult
to make out in what way, although they are always known, yet because
they are not always also thought of, an eternal word can be spoken
respecting them, when our word is spoken in our thought. For it is
eternal to the soul to live; it is eternal to know that it lives. Yet it
is not eternal to it to be thinking of its own life, or to be thinking
of its own knowledge of its own life; since, in entering upon this or
that occupation, it will cease to think of this, although it does not
cease from knowing it. And hence it comes to pass, that if there can be
in the mind any knowledge that is eternal, while the thought of that
knowledge cannot be eternal, and any inner and true word of ours is only
said by our thought, then God alone can be understood to have a Word
that is eternal, and co-eternal with Himself. Unless, perhaps, we are to
say that the very possibility of thought—since that which is known is
capable of being truly thought, even at the time when it is not being
thought—constitutes a word as perpetual as the knowledge itself is
perpetual. But how is that a word which is not yet formed in the vision
of the thought? How will it be like the knowledge of which it is born,
if it has not the form of that knowledge, and is only now called a word
because it can have it? For it is much as if one were to say that a word
is to be so called because it can be a word. But what is this that can
be a word, and is therefore already held worthy of the name of a word?
What, I say, is this thing that is formable, but not yet formed, except
a something in our mind, which we toss to and fro by revolving it this
way or that, while we think of first one thing and then another,
according as they are found by or occur to us? And the true word then
comes into being, when, as I said, that which we toss to and fro by
revolving it arrives at that which we know, and is formed by that, in
taking its entire likeness; so that in what manner each thing is known,
in that manner also it is thought, *i.e.* is said in this manner in the
heart, without articulate sound, without thought of articulate sound,
such as no doubt belongs to some particular tongue. And hence if we even
admit, in order not to dispute laboriously about a name, that this
something of our mind, which can be formed from our knowledge, is to be
already called a word, even before it is so formed, because it is, so to
say, already formable, who would not see how great would be the
unlikeness between it and that Word of God, which is so in the form of
God, as not to have been formable before it was formed, or to have been
capable at any time of being formless, but is a simple form, and simply
equal to Him from whom it is, and with whom it is wonderfully
co-eternal?
