<span id="v.i.i-p1"></span> 1. <span class="c19"><span
id="v.i.i-p1.1"></span>It</span> is difficult to treat of the virtue of
the soul, which is called Continence, in a manner fully suitable and
worthy; but He, whose great gift this virtue is, will help our
littleness under the burden of so great a weight. For He, who bestows it
upon His faithful ones when they are continent, Himself gives discourse
of it to His ministers when they speak. Lastly, of so great a matter
purposing to speak what Himself shall grant, in the first place we say
and prove that Continence is the gift of God. <span
id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806) We have it written in the Book of
Wisdom, that no one can be continent, unless God grant it. But the Lord,
concerning that greater and more glorious Continence itself, whereby
there is continence from the marriage bond, says, “Not all can receive
this saying, but they to whom it is given.” <span
id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807) And since marriage chastity also
itself cannot be guarded, unless there be Continence from unlawful
intercourse, the Apostle declared both to be the gift of God, when He
spake of both lives, that is, both that of marriage and that without
marriage, saying, “I would that all men were so as myself; but each hath
his own gift from God; one in this manner, another in that
manner.” <span id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808)
