<span id="v.iii.xiii-p1"></span> 12. Let marriages possess their own
good, not that they beget sons, but that honestly, that lawfully, that
modestly, that in a spirit of fellowship they beget them, and educate
them, after they have been begotten, with cooperation, with wholesome
teaching, and earnest purpose: in that they keep the faith of the couch
one with another; in that they violate not the sacrament of wedlock. All
these, however, are offices of human duty: but virginal chastity and
freedom through pious continence from all sexual intercourse is the
portion of Angels, and a practice, <span
id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043.md) in corruptible flesh, of perpetual
incorruption. To this let all fruitfulness of the flesh yield, all
chastity of married life; the one is not in (man’s) power, the other is
not in eternity; free choice hath not fruitfulness of the flesh, heaven
hath not chastity of married life. Assuredly they will have something
great beyond others in that common immortality, who have something
already not of the flesh in the flesh.
