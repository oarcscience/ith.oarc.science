<span id="v.iii.xxi-p1"></span> 20. Far be it, therefore, that the
Apostle so said, unto such as are married or are about to marry, “But I
spare you,” as if he were unwilling to say what punishment is due to the
married in another life. Far be it that she, whom Daniel set free from
temporal judgment, be cast by Paul into hell! Far be it that her
husband’s bed be unto her punishment before the judgment seat of Christ,
keeping faith to which she chose, under false charge of adultery, to
meet either danger, or death! To what effect that speech, “It is better
for me to fall into your hands, than to sin in the sight of God:” <span
id="fr_2057"></span>[2058](#fn_2057) if God had been about, not to set
her free because she kept married chastity, but to condemn her because
she had married? And now so often as married chastity is by truth of
holy Scripture justified against such as bring calumnies and charges
against marriage, so often is Susanna by the Holy Spirit defended
against false witnesses, so often is she set free from a false charge,
and with much greater ado. For then against one married woman, now
against all; then of hidden and untrue adultery, now of true and open
marriage, an accusation is laid. Then one woman, upon what the unjust
elders said, now all husbands and wives, upon what the Apostle would not
say, are accused. It was, forsooth, your condemnation, say they, that he
was silent on, when he said, “But I spare you.” Who (saith) this? Surely
he, who had said above; “And, if thou shalt have taken a wife, thou hast
not sinned; and, if a virgin shall have been married, she sinneth
not.” <span id="fr_2058"></span>[2059](#fn_2058) Why, therefore, wherein
he hath been silent through modesty, suspect ye a charge against
marriage; and wherein he hath spoken openly, recognize ye not a defense
of marriage? What, doth he condemn by his silence them whom he acquitted
by his words? Is it not now a milder charge, to charge Susanna, not with
marriage, but with adultery itself, than to charge the doctrine of the
Apostle with falsehood? What in so great peril could we do, were it not
as sure and plain that chaste marriage ought not to be condemned, as it
is sure and plain that holy Scripture cannot lie?
