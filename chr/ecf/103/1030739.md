was granted only to the twelve, see also what Luke relateth: “After
these things,” saith he, “the Lord chose also other seventy and two, and
sent them by two and two before His face into every city and place
whither He was about to come. And He said unto them, The harvest indeed
is plentiful, but the laborers few: ask ye therefore the Lord of the
harvest, that He would send forth laborers into His harvest. Go your
ways: behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves. Carry neither
purse nor scrip nor shoes, and salute no man by the way. Into whatsoever
house ye shall enter, first say, Peace be to this house. And if the son
of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: if not, it shall
return to you. And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such
things as are with them: for the workman is worthy of his hire.” <span

were not commanded, but permitted, that whoso should choose to use,

the Apostle did contrary to a command of the Lord: for, after he had
shown it to be lawful unto him, he hath straightway subjoined, “But yet
have I not used this power.”
