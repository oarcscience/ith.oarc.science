<span id="v.i.iv"></span>

<span id="v.i.iv-p1"></span> 4. For which cause our Lord Himself also
with His own mouth saith, “Cleanse what are within, and what are without
will be clean.” <span id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812.md) And, also, in
another place, when He was refuting the foolish speeches of the Jews, in
that they spake evil against His disciples, eating with unwashen hands;
“Not what entereth into the mouth,” said He, “defileth the man: but what
cometh forth out of the mouth, that defileth the man.” <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813.md) Which sentence, if the whole of it
be taken of the mouth of the body, is absurd. For neither doth vomit
defile him, whom food defileth not. Forsooth food entereth into the
mouth, vomit proceedeth forth out of the mouth. But without doubt the
former words relate to the mouth of the flesh, where He says, “Not what
entereth into the mouth defileth the man,” but the latter words to the
mouth of the heart, where He saith, “But what proceedeth forth out of
the mouth, this defileth the man.” <span
id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814.md) Lastly, when the Apostle Peter
sought of Him an explanation of this as of a parable, He answered, “Are
ye also yet without understanding? understand ye not, that whatsoever
entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the
draught?” Here surely we perceive the mouth of the flesh, into which the
food enters. But in what He next adds, in order that we might recognize
the mouth of the heart, the slowness of our heart would not follow, did
not the Truth deign to walk even with the slow. For He saith, “But what
things go forth from the mouth, go out of the heart;” as though He
should say, When you hear it said “from the mouth,” understand “from the
heart.” I say both, but I set forth one by the other. The inner man hath
an inner mouth, and this the inner ear discerns: what things go forth
from this mouth, go out of the heart, and they defile the man. Then
having left the term mouth, which may be understood also of the body, He
shows more openly what He is saying. “For from the heart go out,” saith
He, “evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false
witness, blasphemies; these are what defile the man.” There is surely no
one of those evils, which can be committed also by the members of the
body, but that the evil thoughts go before and defile the man, although
something hinder the sinful and wicked deeds of the body from following.
For if, because power is not given, the hand is free from the murder of
a man, is the heart of the murderer forsooth therefore clean from sin?
Or if she be chaste, whom one unchaste wishes to commit adultery with,
hath he on that account failed to commit adultery with her in his heart?
Or if the harlot be not found in the brothel, doth he, who seeks her, on
that account fail to commit fornication in his heart? Or if time and
place be wanting to one who wishes to hurt his neighbor by a lie, hath
he on that account failed already to speak false witness with his inner
mouth? Or if any one fearing men, dare not utter aloud blasphemy with
tongue of flesh, is he on this account guiltless of this crime, who
saith in his heart, “There is no God.” <span
id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815.md) Thus all the other evil deeds of
<span id="page_381">p. 381</span> <span id="v.i.iv-Page_381"></span>men,
which no motion of the body performs, of which no sense of the body is
conscious, have their own secret criminals, who are also polluted by
consent alone in thought, that is, by evil words of the inner mouth.
Into which he (the Psalmist) fearing lest his heart should fall aside,
asks of the Lord that the door of Continence be set around the lips of
this mouth, to contain the heart, that it fall not aside into evil
words: but contain it, by not suffering thought to proceed to consent:
for thus, according to the precept of the Apostle, sin reigneth not in
our mortal body, nor do we yield our members as weapons of
unrighteousness unto sin. <span id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816.md)
From fulfilling which precept they are surely far removed, who on this
account turn not their members to sin, because no power is allowed them;
and if this be present, straightway by the motions of their members, as
of weapons, they show, who reigneth in them within. Wherefore so far as
is in themselves, they yield their members weapons of unrighteousness
unto sin; because this is what they wish, which for this reason they
yield not, because they are not able.
