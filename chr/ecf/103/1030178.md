<span id="iv.i.xv-p3"></span>The inquiry is prosecuted respecting
knowledge, in which, as distinguished from wisdom, Augustin had begun in
the former book to look for a kind of trinity. And occasion is taken of
commending Christian faith, and of explaining how the faith of believers
is one and common. Next, that all desire blessedness, yet that all have
not the faith whereby we arrive at blessedness; and that this faith is
defined in Christ, who in the flesh rose from the dead; and that no one
is set free from the dominion of the devil through forgiveness of sins,
save through Him. It is shown also at length that it was needful that
the devil should be conquered by Christ, not by power, but by
righteousness. Finally, that when the words of this faith are committed
to memory, there is in the mind a kind of trinity, since there are,
first, in the memory the sounds of the words, and this even when the man
is not thinking of them; and next, the mind’s eye of his recollection is
formed thereupon when he thinks of them; and, lastly, the will, when he
so thinks and remembers, combines both.
