<span id="v.iii.lvi-p1"></span> 55. If, therefore, ye despise marriages
of sons of men, from which to beget sons of men, love ye with your whole
heart Him, Who is fair of form above the sons of men; ye have leisure;
your heart is free from marriage bonds. Gaze on the Beauty of your
Lover: think of Him equal to the Father, made subject also to His
Mother: ruling even in the heavens, and serving upon the earth: creating
all things, created among all things. That very thing, which in Him the
proud mock at, gaze on, how fair it is: with inward eyes gaze on the
wounds of Him hanging, the scars of Him rising again, the blood of Him
dying, the price of him that believes, the gain of Him that redeems.
Consider of how great value these are, weigh them in the scales of
Charity; and whatever of love ye had to expend upon your marriages, pay
back to Him.
