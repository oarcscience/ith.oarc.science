<span id="v.vi.xxiv-p1"></span> 23. But in all our doings, even good men
are very greatly embarrassed in the matter <span id="page_491">p.
491</span> <span id="v.vi.xxiv-Page_491"></span>of compensative sins; so
that these are not esteemed to be sins, if they have such causes for the
which they be done, and in the which it may seem to be rather sin, if
they be left undone. And chiefly as concerning lies hath it come to this
pass in the opinion of men that those lies are not accounted sins, nay
rather are believed to be rightly done, when one tells a lie for the
benefit of him for whom it is expedient to be deceived, or lest a person
should hurt others, who seems likely to hurt unless he be got rid of by
lies. In defense of these kinds of lies, very many examples from holy
Scripture are accounted to lend their support. It is not, however, the
same thing to hide the truth as it is to utter a lie. For although every
one who lies wishes to hide what is true, yet not every one who wishes
to hide what is true, tells a lie. For in general we hide truths not by
telling a lie, but by holding our peace. For the Lord lied not when He
said, “I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now.” <span id="fr_2413"></span>[2414](#fn_2413) He held His peace from
true things, not spoke false things; for the hearing of which truths He
judged them to be less fit. But if He had not indicated this same to
them, that is, that they were not able to bear the things which He was
unwilling to speak, He would indeed hide nevertheless somewhat of truth
but that this may be rightly done we should peradventure not know, or
not have so great an example to confirm us. Whence, they who assert that
it is sometimes meet to lie, do not conveniently mention that Abraham
did this concerning Sarah, whom he said to be his sister. For he did not
say, She is not my wife, but he said, “She is my sister;” <span
id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414) because she was in truth so near
akin, that she might without a lie be called a sister. Which also
afterwards he confirmed, after she had been given back by him who had
taken her, answering him and saying, “And indeed she is my sister, by
father, not by mother;” that is, by the father’s kindred, not the
mother’s. Somewhat therefore of truth he left untold, not told aught of
falsehood, when he left wife untold, and told of sister. This also did
his son Isaac: for him too we know to have gotten a wife near of
kin. <span id="fr_2415"></span>[2416](#fn_2415) It is not then a lie,
when by silence a true thing is kept back, but when by speech a false
thing is put forward.
