<span id="iv.i.iv-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv.i.iv-p3"></span>Augustin pursues his defense of the
equality of the Trinity; and in treating of the sending of the Son and
of the Holy Spirit, and of the various appearances of God, demonstrates
that He who is sent is not therefore less than He who sends, because the
one has sent, the other has been sent; but that the Trinity, being in
all things equal, and alike in its own nature unchangeable and invisible
and omnipresent, works indivisibly in each sending or appearance.
