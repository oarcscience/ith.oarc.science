<span id="v.iii.xlvi-p1"></span> 45. Wherefore what shall we say? is
there any thought which a virgin of God may truly have, by reason of
which she dare not to set herself before a faithful woman, not only a
widow, but even married? I say not a reprobate virgin; for who knows not
that an obedient woman is to be set before a disobedient virgin? But
where both are obedient unto the commands of God, shall she so tremble
to prefer holy virginity even to chaste marriage, and continence to
wedded life, the fruit an hundred-fold to go before the thirty-fold?
Nay, let her not doubt to prefer this thing to that thing; yet let not
this or that virgin, obeying and fearing God, dare to set herself before
this or that woman, obeying and fearing God; otherwise she will not be
humble, and “God resisteth the proud!” <span
id="fr_2185"></span>[2186](#fn_2185.md) What, therefore, shall she have in
her thoughts? Forsooth the hidden gifts of God, which nought save the
questioning of trial makes known to each, even in himself. For, to pass
over the rest, whence doth a virgin know, although careful of the things
of the Lord, how to please the Lord <span
id="fr_2186"></span>[2187](#fn_2186.md) but that haply, by reason of some
weakness of mind unknown to herself, she be not as yet ripe for
martyrdom, whereas that woman, whom she rejoiced to set herself before,
may already be able to drink the Cup of the Lord’s humiliation, <span
id="fr_2187"></span>[2188](#fn_2187.md) which He set before His disciples,
to drink first, when enamored of high place? Whence, I say, doth she
know but that she herself be not as yet Thecla, that other be already
Crispina. <span id="fr_2188"></span>[2189](#fn_2188.md) Certainly unless
there be present trial, there takes place no proof of this gift.

<span id="v.iii.xlvi-p5"></span> A married woman, who was beheaded in
the persecution under Diocletian and Maximian at Thebeste in Africa. See
Ser. 354, *ad Continentes*, n. 5. where he says, “bethink you that in
the time of persecution not only Agnes the Virgin was crowned, but
likewise Crispina, the wife; and perchance, as there is no doubt, some
of the continent then failed, and many of the wedded fought and
conquered.” *Ben. ed.*
