<span id="v.vii.x-p1"></span> 9. But he speaks more openly in the rest
which he subjoins, and altogether removes all causes of doubting. “If we
unto you,” saith he, “have sown spiritual things, is it a great matter
if we shall reap your carnal things?” What are the spiritual things
which he sowed, but the word and mystery of the sacrament of the kingdom
of heaven? And what the carnal things which he saith he had a right to
reap, but these temporal things which are indulged to the life and
indigency of the flesh? These however being due to him he declares that
he had not sought nor accepted, lest he should cause any impediment to
the Gospel of Christ. What work remaineth for us to understand him to
have wrought, whereby he should get his living, but bodily work, with
his own bodily and visible hands? For if from spiritual work he sought
food and clothing, that is, to receive these of them whom he was
edifying in the Gospel, he could not, as he does, go on to say, “If
others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather?
Nevertheless, <span id="page_508">p. 508</span> <span
id="v.vii.x-Page_508"></span>we have not used this power, but tolerate
all things that we may not cause any hindrance to the Gospel of
Christ.” <span id="fr_2497"></span>[2498](#fn_2497) What power doth he
say he had not used, but that which he had over them, received of the
Lord, the power to reap their carnal things, in order to the sustenance
of this life which is lived in the flesh? Of which power were others
also partakers, who did not at the first announce the Gospel to them,
but came thereafter to their Church preaching the self-same. Therefore,
when he had said, “If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a
great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?” he subjoined, “If
others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather?” And when
he had demonstrated what power they had: “Nevertheless we have not
used,” saith he, “this power; but we put up with all things, lest we
should cause any impediment to the Gospel of Christ.” Let therefore
these persons say in what way from spiritual work the Apostle had carnal
food, when himself openly says that he had not used this power. But if
from spiritual work he had not carnal food, it remains that from bodily
work he had it and thereof saith, “Neither did we eat any man’s bread
for nought; but wrought with labor and travail night and day, that we
might not be chargeable to any of you: not because we have not power,
but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us. <span
id="fr_2498"></span>[2499](#fn_2498) All things,” saith he, “we suffer,
lest we cause any hindrance to the Gospel of Christ.”
