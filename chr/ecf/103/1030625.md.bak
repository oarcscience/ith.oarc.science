<span id="v.iv.xiii-p1"></span> 12. But since, as the Lord saith, “Not
all receive this word;” <span id="fr_2248"></span>[2249](#fn_2248.md)
therefore let her who can receive it, receive it; and let her, who
containeth not, marry; let her, who hath not begun, deliberate; let her,
who hath undertaken it, persevere; let there be no occasion given unto
the adversary, let there be no oblation withdrawn from Christ. Forsooth
in the marriage bond if chastity be preserved, condemnation is not
feared; but in widowed and virginal continence, the excellence of a
greater gift <span id="fr_2249"></span>[2250](#fn_2249.md) is sought for:
and, when this has been sought, and chosen, and by debt of vow offered,
from this time not only to enter upon marriage, but, although one be not
married, to wish to marry is matter of condemnation. For, in order to
show this, the Apostle saith not, “When they shall have lived in
delights, in Christ” they marry; <span
id="fr_2250"></span>[2251](#fn_2250.md) but “they wish to marry; having,”
saith he, “condemnation, in that they have made of none effect their
first faith,” although not by marrying, yet by wishing; not that the
marriages even of such are judged matter of condemnation; but there is
condemned a wrong done to purpose, there is condemned a broken faith of
vow, there is condemned not a relief by lower good, but a fall from
higher good: <span id="page_446">p. 446</span> <span
id="v.iv.xiii-Page_446"></span>lastly, such are condemned, not because
they have entered upon marriage faith afterwards, but because they have
made of none effect the first faith of continence. And in order to
suggest this in few words, the Apostle would not say, that they have
condemnation, who after purpose of greater sanctity marry, (not because
they are not condemned, but lest in them marriage itself should be
thought to be condemned:) but, after he had said, “they wish to marry,”
he straightway added, “having condemnation.” And he stated the reason,
“in that they have made of none effect their former faith,” in order
that it may appear that it is the will which fell away from its purpose,
which is condemned, whether marriage follow, or fail to follow.
