<span id="iv.ii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—Error, Though Not Always a Sin,
is Always an Evil.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxiii-p2"></span>But as to those matters in regard to
which <span id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span
id="iv.ii.xxiii-Page_245"></span>our belief or disbelief, and indeed
their truth or supposed truth or falsity, are of no importance whatever,
so far as attaining the kingdom of God is concerned: to make a mistake
in such matters is not to be looked on as a sin, or at least as a very
small and trifling sin. In short, a mistake in matters of this kind,
whatever its nature and magnitude, does not relate to the way of
approach to God, which is the faith of Christ that “worketh by
love.” <span id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md) For the “mistake
pleasing to parents” in the case of the twin children was no deviation
from this way; nor did the Apostle Peter deviate from this way, when,
thinking that he saw a vision, he so mistook one thing for another,
that, till the angel who delivered him had departed from him, he did not
distinguish the real objects among which he was moving from the
visionary objects of a dream; <span id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md)
nor did the patriarch Jacob deviate from this way, when he believed that
his son, who was really alive, had been slain by a beast. <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md) In the case of these and other
false impressions of the same kind, we are indeed deceived, but our
faith in God remains secure. We go astray, but we do not leave the way
that leads us to Him. But yet these errors, though they are not sinful,
are to be reckoned among the evils of this life which is so far made
subject to vanity, that we receive what is false as if it were true,
reject what is true as if it were false, and cling to what is uncertain
as if it were certain. And although they do not trench upon that true
and certain faith through which we reach eternal blessedness, yet they
have much to do with that misery in which we are now living. And
assuredly, if we were now in the enjoyment of the true and perfect
happiness that lies before us, we should not be subject to any deception
through any sense, whether of body or of mind.
