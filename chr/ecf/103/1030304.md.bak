id="iv.ii.lvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 54.—Christ’s Second Coming Does Not
Belong to the Past, But Will Take Place at the End of the World.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lvi-p2"></span>But what we believe as to Christ’s action
in the future, when He shall come from heaven to judge the quick and the
dead, has no bearing upon the life which we now lead here; for it forms
no part of what He did upon earth, but is part of what He shall do at
the end of the world. And it is to this that the apostle refers in what
immediately follows the passage quoted above: “When Christ, who is our
life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.” <span
