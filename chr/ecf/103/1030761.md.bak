<span id="v.vii.xxx-p1"></span> 29. But let us grant this also, that the
whole year round there may in the fields be found either of tree or of
herbs or of any manner of roots, that which may be taken as food
uncooked; or, at any rate, let so great exercise of body be used, that
the things which require cooking, may be taken even raw without hurt,
and people may even in winter weather, no matter how rough, go forth to
their fodder; and so it shall be the case that nothing be taken away to
be prepared, nothing laid up for the morrow. Yet will not those men be
able to keep these rules, who for many days separating themselves from
sight of men, and allowing none access to them, do shut themselves up,
living in great earnestness of prayers. For these do use to shut up with
themselves store of aliments, <span id="page_518">p. 518</span> <span
id="v.vii.xxx-Page_518"></span>such indeed as are most easily and
cheaply had, yet still a store which may suffice for those days during
which they purpose that no man shall see them; which thing the birds do
not. Now touching these men’s exercising of themselves in so marvellous
continency, seeing that they have leisure for the doing of these things,
and not in proud elation but in merciful sanctity do propose themselves
for men’s imitation, I not only do not blame it, but know not how to
praise it as much as it deserves. And yet what are we to say of such
men, according to these persons’ understanding of the evangelical words?
Or haply the holier they be, the more unlike are they to the fowls?
because unless they lay by for themselves food for many days, to shut
themselves up as they do they will not have strength? Howbeit, to them
as well as us is it said, “Take therefore no thought for the
morrow.” <span id="fr_2568"></span>[2569](#fn_2568.md)
