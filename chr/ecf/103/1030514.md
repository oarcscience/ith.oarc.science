<span id="v.i.xxxi-p1"></span> 31. “But now do ye also,” saith he, “put
down all;” <span id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926.md) and he makes
mention of several <span id="page_393">p. 393</span> <span
id="v.i.xxxi-Page_393"></span>more evils of that sort. But what is it,
that it is not enough for him to say, “Do ye put down all,” but that he
added the conjunction and said, “ye also?” save that lest they should
not think that they did those evils and lived in them with impunity on
this account, because their faith set them free from wrath, which cometh
upon the sons of unbelief, doing these things, and living in them
without faith. Do ye also, saith he, put down those evils, on account of
which cometh the wrath of God on the children of unbelief; nor promise
yourselves impunity of them on account of merit of faith. But he would
not say, “put ye down,” unto those who had already laid down so far as
that they consented not to such faults, nor were yielding their members
to them as weapons of sin, save that the life of Saints stands in this
past deed, and is still engaged in this work, so long as we are mortal.
For, so long as the Spirit lusteth against the flesh, this business
proceeds with great earnestness, resistance is offered unto evil
delights, unclean lusts, carnal and shameful motions, by the sweetness
of holiness, by the love of chastity, by spiritual vigor, and by the
beauty of continence; thus they are laid down by them who are dead to
them, and who live not in them by consenting. Thus, I say, they are put
down, whilst they are weighed down by continued continence, that they
rise not again. Whosoever, as though secure, shall cease from this
laying aside of them, straightway they will assault the Citadel of the
mind, and will themselves put it down thence, and will reduce it into
slavery to them, captive after a base and unseemly fashion. Then sin
will reign in the mortal body of man to obey its desires; then will it
yield its members weapons of unrighteousness unto sin: <span
id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927.md) and the last state of that man
shall be worse than the former. <span
id="fr_1928"></span>[1929](#fn_1928.md) For it is much more tolerable not
to have begun a contest of this kind, than after one hath begun to have
left the conflict, and to have become in place of a good warrior, or
even in place of a conqueror, a captive. Whence the Lord saith not,
whoso shall begin, but “Whoso shall persevere unto the end, he shall be
saved.” <span id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929.md)
