<span id="v.i.xxix-p1"></span> 29. Thus the spirit of man, cleaving unto
the Spirit of God, lusts against the flesh, that is, against itself: but
for itself, in order that those motions, whether in the flesh or in the
soul, after man, not after God, which as yet exist through the sickness
man hath gotten, may be restrained by continence, that so health may be
gotten; and man, not living after man, may now be able to say, “But I
live, now not I, but there liveth in me Christ.” <span
id="fr_1915"></span>[1916](#fn_1915) For where not I, there more happily
I: and, when any evil motion after man arises, unto which he, who with
the mind serves the Law of God, consents not, let him say that also,
“Now it is not I that do this.” <span
id="fr_1916"></span>[1917](#fn_1916) To such forsooth are said those
words, which we, as partners and sharers with them, ought to listen
to. <span id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917) “If ye have risen
together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is
sitting at the Right Hand of God: mind <span
id="fr_1918"></span>[1919](#fn_1918) the things that are above, not what
are upon earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in
God: when Christ your life shall have appeared, then ye also shall
appear with Him in glory.” Let us understand unto whom he is speaking,
yea, rather, let us listen with more attention. For what more plain than
this? what more clear? He is certainly speaking unto those, who had
risen again with Christ, not yet surely in the flesh, but in the mind:
whom he calls dead, and on this account the more living: for “your
life,” saith he, “is hid with Christ in God.” Of such dead the speech
is: “But I live, now not I, but there liveth in me Christ.” They
therefore, whose life was hidden in God, are admonished and exhorted to
mortify their members, which are upon the earth. For this follows,
“Mortify, therefore, your members, which are upon the earth.” And, lest
any through excess of dullness should think that such are to mortify the
members of the body that are seen, straightway opening what it is he
saith, “Fornication,” saith he, “uncleanness, passion, evil lust, and
covetousness, which is idolatry.” <span
id="fr_1919"></span>[1920](#fn_1919) But is it so to be believed, that
they, who were already dead, and their life hidden with Christ in God,
were still committing fornication, were still living in unclean habits
and works, were still slaves to passions of evil lust and covetousness?
What madman would thus think of such? What, therefore, would he that
they mortify, save the motions themselves still living in a certain
intrusion <span id="fr_1920"></span>[1921](#fn_1920) of their own,
without the consent of our mind, without the action of the members of
the body? And how are they mortified by the work of continence, save
when we consent not to them with the mind, nor are the members of the
body yielded to them as weapons; and, what is greater, and to be looked
to with yet greater watchfulness of continence, our very thought itself,
although in a certain way it be touched by their suggestion, and as it
were, whisper, yet turns away from these, that it receive not delight
from them, and turns to more delightful thoughts of things above: on
this account naming them in discourse, that men abide not in them, but
flee from them. And this is brought to pass, if we listen effectually,
with His help, Who, through His Apostle gives this command, “Seek things
that are above, where Christ is sitting at the Right Hand of God. Mind
the things that are above, not what are on earth.” <span
