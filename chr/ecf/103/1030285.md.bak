<span id="iv.ii.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—Jesus Christ, Being the Only
Son of God, is at the Same Time Man.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxxvii-p2"></span>Wherefore Christ Jesus, the Son of
God, is both God and man; God before all worlds; man in our world: God,
because the Word of God (for “the Word was God” <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148) .md); and man, because in His one
person the Word was joined with a body and a rational soul. Wherefore,
so far as He is God, He and the Father are one; so far as He is man, the
Father is greater than He. For when He was the only Son of God, not by
grace, but by nature, that He might be also full of grace, He became the
Son of man; and He Himself unites both natures in His own identity, and
both natures constitute one Christ; because, “being in the form of God,
He thought it not robbery to be,” what He was by nature, “equal with
God.” <span id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149.md) But He made Himself of
no reputation, and took upon Himself the form of a servant, not losing
or lessening the form of God. And, accordingly, He was both made less
and remained equal, being both in one, as has been said: but He was one
of these as Word, and the other as man. As Word, He is equal with the
Father; as man, less than the Father. One Son of God, and at the same
time Son of man; one Son of man, and at the same time Son of God; not
two Sons of God, God and man, but one Son of God: God without beginning;
man with a beginning, our Lord Jesus Christ.
