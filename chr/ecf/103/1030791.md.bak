<span id="v.viii.xvii-p1"></span> 16. Here some man shall say; “If the
concupiscence of the bad, whereby it comes that they bear all evils for
that which they lust after, be of the world, how is it said to be of
their will?” As if, truly, they were not themselves also of the world,
when they love the world, forsaking Him by Whom the world was made. For
“they serve the creature <span id="page_533">p. 533</span> <span
id="v.viii.xvii-Page_533"></span>more than the Creator, Who is blessed
for ever.” <span id="fr_2669"></span>[2670](#fn_2669.md) Whether then by
the word “world,” the Apostle John signifies lovers of the world, the
will, as it is of themselves, is therefore of the world: or whether
under the name of the world he comprises heaven and earth, and all that
is therein, that is the creature universally, it is plain that the will
of the creature, not being that of the Creator, is of the world. For
which cause to such the Lord saith, “Ye are from beneath, I am from
above: ye are of this world, I am not of this world.” <span
id="fr_2670"></span>[2671](#fn_2670.md) And to the Apostle He saith, “If ye
were of the world, the world would love his own.” But lest they should
arrogate more unto themselves than their measure craved, and when He
said that they were not of the world, should imagine this to be of
nature, not of grace, therefore He saith, “But because ye are not of the
world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world
hateth you.” It follows, that they once were of the world: for, that
they might not be of the world, they were chosen out of the world.
