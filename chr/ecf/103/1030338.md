id="iv.ii.xc-p1.1"></span>Chapter 88.—The Material of the Body Never
Perishes.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xc-p2"></span>Nor does the earthly material out of which
men’s mortal bodies are created ever perish; but though it may crumble
into dust and ashes, or be dissolved into vapors and exhalations, though
it may be transformed into the substance of other bodies, or dispersed
into the elements, though it should become food for beasts or men, and
be changed into their flesh, it returns in a moment of time to that
human soul which animated it at the first, and which caused it to become
man, and to live and grow.
