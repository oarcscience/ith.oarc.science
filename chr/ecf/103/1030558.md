<span id="v.iii.v-p1"></span> 4. Her virginity also itself was on this
account more pleasing and accepted, in that it was not that Christ being
conceived in her, rescued it beforehand from a husband who would violate
it, Himself to preserve it; but, before He was conceived, chose it,
already dedicated to God, as that from which to be born. This is shown
by the words which Mary spake in answer to the Angel announcing to her
her conception; “How,” saith she, “shall this be, seeing I know not a
man?” <span id="fr_2030"></span>[2031](#fn_2030) Which assuredly she
would not say, unless she had before vowed herself unto God as a virgin.
But, because the habits of the Israelites as yet refused this, she was
espoused to a just man, who would not take from her by violence, but
rather guard against violent persons, what she had already vowed.
Although, even if she had said this only, “How shall this take place?”
and had not added, “seeing I know not a man,” certainly she would not
have asked, how, being a female, she should give birth to her promised
Son, if she had married with purpose of sexual intercourse. She might
have been bidden also to continue a virgin, that in her by fitting
miracle the Son of God should receive the form of a servant, but, being
to be a pattern to holy virgins, lest it should be thought that she
alone needed to be a virgin, who had obtained to conceive a child even
without sexual intercourse, she dedicated her virginity to God, when as
yet she knew not what she should conceive, in order that the imitation
of a heavenly life in an earthly and mortal body should take place of
vow, not of command; through love of choosing, not through necessity of
doing service. Thus Christ by being born of a virgin, who, before she
knew Who was to be born of her, had determined to continue a virgin,
chose rather to approve, than to command, holy virginity. And thus, even
in the female herself, in whom He took the form of a servant, He willed
that virginity should be free.
