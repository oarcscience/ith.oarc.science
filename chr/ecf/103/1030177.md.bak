<span id="iv.i.xiv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xiv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—In Opposition to the
Reminiscence of Plato and Pythagoras. Pythagoras the Samian. Of the
Difference Between Wisdom and Knowledge, and of Seeking the Trinity in
the Knowledge of Temporal Things.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xiv.xv-p2"></span>24. And hence that noble philosopher
Plato endeavored to persuade us that the souls of men lived even before
they bare these bodies; and that hence those things which are learnt are
rather remembered, as having been known already, than taken into
knowledge as things new. For he has told us that a boy, when questioned
I know not what respecting geometry, replied as if he were perfectly
skilled in that branch of learning. For being questioned step by step
and skillfully, he saw what was to be seen, and said that which he
saw. <span id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790.md) But if this had been a
recollecting of things previously known, then certainly every one, or
almost every one, would not have been able so to answer when questioned.
For not every one was a geometrician in the former life, since
geometricians are so few among men that scarcely one can be found
anywhere. But we ought rather to believe, that the intellectual mind is
so formed in its nature as to see those things, which by the disposition
of the Creator are subjoined to things intelligible in a natural order,
by a sort of incorporeal light of an unique kind; as the eye of the
flesh sees things adjacent to itself in this bodily light, of which
light it is made to be receptive, and adapted to it. For none the more
does this fleshly eye, too, distinguish black things from white without
a teacher, because it had already known them before it was created in
this flesh. Why, lastly, is it possible only in intelligible things that
any one properly questioned should answer according to any branch of
learning, although ignorant of it? Why can no one do this with things
sensible, except those which he has seen in this his present body, or
has believed the information of others who knew them, whether somebody’s
writings or words? For we must not acquiesce in their story, who assert
that the Samian Pythagoras recollected some things of this kind, which
he had experienced when he was previously here in another body; and
others tell yet of others, that they experienced something of the same
<span id="page_165">p. 165</span> <span
id="iv.i.xiv.xv-Page_165"></span>sort in their minds: but it may be
conjectured that these were untrue recollections, such as we commonly
experience in sleep, when we fancy we remember, as though we had done or
seen it, what we never did or saw at all; and that the minds of these
persons, even though awake, were affected in this way at the suggestion
of malignant and deceitful spirits, whose care it is to confirm or to
sow some false belief concerning the changes of souls, in order to
deceive men. This, I say, may be conjectured from this, that if they
really remembered those things which they had seen here before, while
occupying other bodies, the same thing would happen to many, nay to
almost all; since they suppose that as the dead from the living, so,
without cessation and continually, the living are coming into existence
from the dead; as sleepers from those that are awake, and those that are
awake from them that sleep.

<span id="iv.i.xiv.xv-p4"></span>25. If therefore this is the right
distinction between wisdom and knowledge, that the intellectual
cognizance of eternal things belongs to wisdom, but the rational
cognizance of temporal things to knowledge, it is not difficult to judge
which is to be preferred or postponed to which. But if we must employ
some other distinction by which to know these two apart, which without
doubt the apostle teaches us are different, saying, “To one is given by
the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge, by the
same Spirit:” still the difference between those two which we have laid
down is a most evident one, in that the intellectual cognizance of
eternal things is one thing, the rational cognizance of temporal things
another; and no one doubts but that the former is to be preferred to the
latter. As then we leave behind those things which belong to the outer
man, and desire to ascend within from those things which we have in
common with beasts, before we come to the cognizance of things
intelligible and supreme, which are eternal, the rational cognizance of
temporal things presents itself. Let us then find a trinity in this
also, if we can, as we found one in the senses of the body, and in those
things which through them entered in the way of images into our soul or
spirit; so that instead of corporeal things which we touch by corporeal
sense, placed as they are without us, we might have resemblances of
bodies impressed within on the memory from which thought might be
formed, while the will as a third united them; just as the sight of the
eyes was formed from without, which the will applied to the visible
thing in order to produce vision, and united both, while itself also
added itself thereto as a third. But this subject must not be compressed
into this book; so that in that which follows, if God help, it may be
suitably examined, and the conclusions to which we come may be unfolded.
