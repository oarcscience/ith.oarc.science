<span id="v.v.xxiv-p1"></span> 23. This did a former Bishop of the
Church of Thagasta, Firmus by name, and even more firm in will. For,
when he was asked by command of the emperor, through officers sent by
him, for a man who was taking refuge with him, and whom he kept in
hiding with all possible care, he made answer to their questions, that
he could neither tell a lie, nor betray a man; and when he had suffered
so many torments of body, (for as yet emperors were not Christian,) he
stood firm in his purpose. Thereupon being brought before the emperor,
his conduct appeared so admirable, that he without any difficulty
obtained a pardon for the man whom he was trying to save. What conduct
could be more brave and constant? But peradventure some more timid
person may say, “I can be prepared to bear any torments, or even to
submit to death, that I may not sin; but, since it is no sin to tell a
lie such that you neither hurt any man, nor bear false witness, and
benefit some man, it is foolish and a great sin, voluntarily and to no
purpose to submit to torments, and, when one’s health and life may haply
be useful, to fling them away for nothing to people in a rage.” Of whom
I ask; Why he fears that which is written, “Thou shall not bear false
witness,” <span id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333.md) and fears not that
which is said unto God, “Thou wilt destroy all them that speak
leasing?” <span id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334.md) Says he, “It is not
written, Every lie: but I understand it as if it were written, Thou wilt
destroy all that speak false witness.” But neither there is it said, All
false witness. “Yes, but it is set there,” saith he, “where the other
things are set down which are in every sort evil.” What, is this the
case with what is set down there, “Thou shalt not kill?” <span
id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335.md) If this be in every sort evil, how
shall one clear of this crime even just men, who, upon a law given, have
<span id="page_469">p. 469</span> <span
id="v.v.xxiv-Page_469"></span>killed many? “But,” it is rejoined, “that
man doth not himself kill, who is the minister of some just command.”
These men’s fear, then, I do accept, that I still think that laudable
man who would neither lie, nor betray a man, did both better understand
that which is written, and what he understood did bravely put in
practice.
