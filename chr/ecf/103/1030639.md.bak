<span id="v.iv.xxvii-p1"></span> 26. Therefore let spiritual delights
succeed to the place of carnal delights in holy chastity; reading,
prayer, psalm, good thought, frequency in good works, hope of the world
to come, and a heart upward; and for all these giving of thanks unto the
Father of lights, from Whom, without any doubt, every good gift, and
every perfect gift, as Scripture bears witness, cometh down. <span
id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md) For when, in stead of the delights
of married women, which they have in the flesh of their husbands, the
use of other carnal delights is taken, as it were to solace them, why
should I speak of the evils which follow, when the Apostle hath said in
short, that the widow, who lives in delights, living is dead. <span
id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288.md) But far be it from you, that ye be
taken with lust of riches instead of lust of marriage, or that in your
hearts money succeed to the place of love of a husband. For looking into
men’s conversation, we have often found by experience, that in certain
persons, when wantonness hath been restrained, avarice hath increased.
For, as, in the senses themselves of the body, they who see not hear
more keenly, and discern many things by touch, nor have such as have the
use of their eyes so great life in their touch; and in this instance it
is understood that, when the exertion of the power of attention <span
id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289.md) hath been restrained in one
approach, that is, of the eyes, it puts itself forth into other senses,
more ready with keenness to distinguish, as though it essayed to supply
from the one what was denied in the other; thus also often carnal lust,
being restrained from pleasure of sensual intercourse, with greater
strength reaches itself forth to desire money, and when turned away from
the one, turns itself with more glow of passion to the other. But in you
let the love of riches grow cold together with the love of marriage, and
let a pious use of what property you possess be directed to spiritual
delights, that your liberality wax warm rather in helping such as are in
want than in enriching covetous persons. Forsooth into the heavenly
treasury are sent not gifts to the covetous, but alms to the needy,
which above measure help the prayers of widows. Fastings, also, and
watchings, so far as they disturb not health, if they be spent in
praying, singing psalms, reading, and meditating in the Law of God, even
the very things which seem laborious are turned into spiritual delights.
For no way burdensome are the labors of such as love, but even of
themselves delight, as of such as hunt, fowl, fish, gather grapes,
traffic, delight themselves with some game. It matters therefore what
<span id="page_453">p. 453</span> <span
id="v.iv.xxvii-Page_453"></span>be loved. For, in the case of what is
loved, either there is no labor, or the labor also is loved. And
consider how it should be matter for shame and grief, if there be
pleasure in labor, to take a wild beast, to fill cask and purse, <span
id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290.md) to cast a ball, and there be no
pleasure in labors to win God!
