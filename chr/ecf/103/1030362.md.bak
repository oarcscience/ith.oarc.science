<span id="iv.ii.cxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.cxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 112.—There is No Ground in Scripture
for the Opinion of Those Who Deny the Eternity of Future
Punishments.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cxiv-p2"></span>It is in vain, then, that some, indeed
very many, make moan over the eternal punishment, and perpetual,
unintermitted torments of the lost, and say they do not believe it shall
be so; not, indeed, that they directly oppose themselves to Holy
Scripture, but, at the suggestion of their own feelings, they soften
down everything that seems hard, and give a milder turn to statements
which they think are rather designed to terrify than to be received as
literally true. For “Hath God” they say, forgotten to be gracious? hath
He in anger shut up His tender mercies?” <span
id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md) Now, they read this in one of the
holy psalms. But without doubt we are to understand it as spoken of
those who are elsewhere called “vessels of mercy,” <span
id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304.md) because even they are freed from
misery not on account of any merit of their own, but solely through the
pity of God. Or, if the men we speak of insist that this passage applies
to all mankind, there is no reason why they should therefore suppose
that there will be an end to the punishment of those of whom it is said,
“These shall go away into everlasting punishment;” for this shall end in
the same manner and at the same time as the happiness of those of whom
it is said, “but the righteous unto life eternal.” <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305.md) But let them suppose, if the
thought gives them pleasure, that the pains of the damned are, at
certain intervals, in some degree assuaged. For even in this case the
wrath of God, that is, their condemnation (for it is this, and not any
disturbed feeling in the mind of God that is called His wrath), abideth
upon them; <span id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306.md) that is, His
wrath, though it still remains, does not shut up His tender mercies;
though His tender mercies are exhibited, not in putting an end to their
eternal punishment, but in mitigating, or in granting them a respite
from, their torments; for the psalm does not say, “to put an end to His
anger,” or, “when His anger is passed by,” but “in His anger.” <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307.md) Now, if this anger stood alone, or
if it existed in the smallest conceivable degree, yet to be lost out of
the kingdom of God, to be an exile from the city of God, to be alienated
from the life of God, to have no share in that great goodness which God
hath laid up for them that fear Him, and hath wrought out for them that
trust in Him, <span id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308.md) would be a
punishment so great, that, supposing it to be eternal, no torments that
we know of, continued through as many ages as man’s imagination can
conceive, could be compared with it.
