<span id="iv.i.xi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Whether Only Knowledge that is
Loved is the Word of the Mind.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xi.x-p2"></span>15. It is rightly asked then, whether all
knowledge is a word, or only knowledge that is loved. For we also know
the things which we hate; but what we do not like, cannot be said to be
either conceived or brought forth by the mind. For not all things which
in anyway touch it, are conceived by it; but some only reach the point
of being known, but yet are not spoken as words, as for instance those
of which we speak now. For those are called words in one way, which
occupy spaces of time by their syllables, whether they are pronounced or
only thought; and in another way, all that is known is called a word
imprinted on the mind, as long as it can be brought forth from the
memory and defined, even though we dislike the thing itself; and in
another way still, when we like that which is conceived in the mind. And
that which the apostle says, must be taken according to this last kind
of word, “No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy
Ghost;” <span id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md) since those also say
this, but according to another meaning of the term “word,” of whom the
Lord Himself says, “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall
enter into the kingdom of heaven.” <span
id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md) Nay, even in the case of things which
we hate, when we rightly dislike and rightly censure them, we approve
and like the censure bestowed upon them, and it becomes a word. Nor is
it the knowledge of vices that displeases us, but the <span
id="page_132">p. 132</span> <span id="iv.i.xi.x-Page_132"></span>vices
themselves. For I like to know and define what intemperance is; and this
is its word. Just as there are known faults in art, and the knowledge of
them is rightly approved, when a connoisseur discerns the species or the
privation of excellence, as to affirm and deny that it is or that it is
not; yet to be without excellence and to fall away into fault, is worthy
of condemnation. And to define intemperance, and to say its word,
belongs to the art of morals; but to be intemperate belongs to that
which that art censures. Just as to know and define what a solecism is,
belongs to the art of speaking; but to be guilty of one, is a fault
which the same art reprehends. A word, then, which is the point we wish
now to discern and intimate, is knowledge together with love. Whenever,
then, the mind knows and loves itself, its word is joined to it by love.
And since it loves knowledge and knows love, both the word is in love
and love is in the word, and both are in him who loves and speaks. <span

<span id="iv.i.xi.x-p5"></span> \[The meaning of this obscure chapter
seems to be, that only what the mind is pleased with, is the real
expression and index of the mind—its true “word.” The true nature of the
mind is revealed in its sympathies. But this requires some
qualification. For in the case of contrary qualities, like right and
wrong, beauty and ugliness, the real nature of the mind is seen also in
its antipathy as well as in its sympathy; in its hatred of wrong as well
as in its love of right. Each alike is a true index of the mind, because
each really implies the other.—W.G.T.S.\]
