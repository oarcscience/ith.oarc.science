<span id="iv.i.xv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Of the Same Thing.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xv.v-p2"></span>8. Or is, perhaps, the deliverance from
our difficulties to be found in this, that, since we have said that
every one places his idea of a blessed life in that which has most
pleased him, as pleasure pleased Epicurus, and goodness Zeno, and
something else pleased other people, we say that to live blessedly is
nothing else but to live according to one’s own pleasure: so that it is
not false that all will to live blessedly, because all will that which
pleases each? For if this, too, had been proclaimed to the people in the
theatre, all would have found it in their own wills. But <span
id="page_171">p. 171</span> <span id="iv.i.xv.v-Page_171"></span>when
Cicero, too, had propounded this in opposition to himself, he so refuted
it as to make them blush who thought so. For he says: “But, behold!
people who are not indeed philosophers, but who yet are prompt to
dispute, say that all are blessed, whoever live as they will;” which is
what we mean by, as pleases each. But by and by he has subjoined: “But
this is indeed false. For to will what is not fitting, is itself most
miserable; neither is it so miserable not to obtain what one wills, as
to will to obtain what one ought not.” Most excellently and altogether
most truly does he speak. For who can be so blind in his mind, so
alienated from all light of decency, and wrapped up in the darkness of
indecency, as to call him blessed, because he lives as he will, who
lives wickedly and disgracefully; and with no one restraining him, no
one punishing, and no one daring even to blame him, nay more, too, with
most people praising him, since, as divine Scripture says, “The wicked
is praised in his heart’s desire: and he who works iniquity is
blessed,” <span id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800.md) gratifies all his most
criminal and flagitious desires; when, doubtless, although even so he
would be wretched, yet he would be less wretched, if he could have had
nothing of those things which he had wrongly willed? For every one is
made wretched by a wicked will also, even though it stop short with will
but more wretched by the power by which the longing of a wicked will is
fulfilled. And, therefore, since it is true that all men will to be
blessed, and that they seek for this one thing with the most ardent
love, and on account of this seek everything which they do seek; nor can
any one love that of which he does not know at all what or of what sort
it is, nor can be ignorant what that is which he knows that he wills; it
follows that all know a blessed life. But all that are blessed have what
they will, although not all who have what they will are forewith
blessed. But they are forewith wretched, who either have not what they
will, or have that which they do not rightly will. Therefore he only is
a blessed man, who both has all things which he wills, and wills nothing
ill.
