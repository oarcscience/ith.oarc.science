<span id="v.ii.ii-p1"></span> 1. <span class="c19"><span
id="v.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Forasmuch</span> as each man is a part of the
human race, and human nature is something social, and hath for a great
and natural good, the power also of friendship; on this account God
willed to create all men out of one, in order that they might be held in
their society not only by likeness of kind, but also by bond of kindred.
Therefore the first natural bond of human society is man and wife. Nor
did God create these each by himself, and join them together as alien by
birth: but He created the one out of the other, setting a sign also of
the power of the union in the side, whence she was drawn, was
formed. <span id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933) For they are joined
one to another side by side, who walk together, and look together
whither they walk. Then follows the connexion of fellowship in children,
which is the one alone worthy fruit, not of the union of male and
female, but of the sexual intercourse. For it were possible that there
should exist in either sex, even without such intercourse, a certain
friendly and true union of the one ruling, and the other obeying.
