<span id="iv.i.vi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—The Same Argument
Continued.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vi.x-p2"></span>He did not say, I and they are one
thing; <span id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) although, in that He is
the head of the church which is His body, <span
id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md) He might have said, and they are, not
one thing, <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) but one person, <span
id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md) because the head and the body is one
Christ; but in order to show His own Godhead consubstantial with the
Father (for which reason He says in another place, “I and my Father are
one” <span id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499) .md), in His own kind, that
is, in the consubstantial parity of the same nature, He wills His own to
be one, <span id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) but in Himself; since
they could not be so in themselves, separated as they are one from
another by divers pleasures and desires and uncleannesses of sin; whence
they are cleansed through the Mediator, that they may be one <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) in Him, not only through the same
nature in which all become from mortal men equal to the angels, but also
through the same will most harmoniously conspiring to the same
blessedness, and fused in some way by the fire of charity into one
spirit. For to this His words come, “That they may be one, even as we
are one;” namely, that as the Father and Son are one, not only in
equality of substance, but also in will, so those also may be one,
between whom and God the Son is mediator, not only in that they are of
the same nature, but also through the same union of love. And then He
goes on thus to intimate the truth itself, that He is the Mediator,
through whom we are reconciled to God, by saying, “I in them, and Thou
in me, that they may be made perfect in one.” <span
