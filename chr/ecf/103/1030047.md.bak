<span id="iv.i.v.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Why Miracles are Not Usual
Works.</span>

<span id="iv.i.v.vi-p2"></span>11. For since the divine power
administers the whole spiritual and corporeal creature, the waters of
the sea are summoned and poured out upon the face of the earth on
certain days of every year. But when this was done at the prayer of the
holy Elijah; because so continued and long a course of fair weather had
gone before, that men were famished; and because at that very hour, in
which the servant of God prayed, the air itself had not, by any moist
aspect, put forth signs of the coming rain; the divine power was
apparent in the great and rapid showers that followed, and by which that
miracle was granted and dispensed. <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md) In like manner, God works ordinarily
through thunders and lightnings: but because these were wrought in an
unusual manner on Mount Sinai, and those sounds were not uttered with a
confused noise, but so that it appeared by most sure proofs that certain
intimations were given by them, they were miracles. <span
id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371.md) Who draws up the sap through the root
of the vine to the bunch of grapes, and makes the wine, except God; who,
while man plants and waters, Himself giveth the increase? <span
id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372.md) But when, at the command of the Lord,
the water was turned into wine with an extraordinary quickness, the
divine power was made manifest, by the confession even of the
foolish. <span id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373.md) Who ordinarily clothes
the trees with leaves and flowers except God? Yet, when the rod of Aaron
the priest blossomed, the Godhead in some way conversed with doubting
humanity. <span id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374.md) Again, the earthy
matter certainly serves in common to the production and formation both
of all kinds of wood and of the flesh of all animals: and who makes
these things, but He who said, Let the earth bring them forth; <span
id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md) and who governs and guides by the same
word of His, those things which He has created? Yet, when He changed the
same matter out of the rod of Moses into the flesh of a serpent,
immediately and quickly, <span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span
id="iv.i.v.vi-Page_60"></span>that change, which was unusual, although
of a thing which was changeable, was a miracle. <span
id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376.md) But who is it that gives life to every
living thing at its birth, unless He who gave life to that serpent also
for the moment, as there was need. <span

<span id="iv.i.v.vi-p10"></span> \[One chief reason why a miracle is
incredible for the skeptic, is the difficulty of working it. If the
miracle were easy of execution for man—who for the skeptic is the
measure of power—his disbelief of it would disappear. In reference to
this objection, Augustin calls attention to the fact, that so far as
difficulty of performance is concerned, the products of nature are as
impossible to man as supernatural products. Aaron could no more have
made an almond rod blossom and fructuate on an almond tree, than off it.
That a miracle is difficult to be wrought is, consequently, no good
reason for disbelieving its reality.—W.G.T.S.\]
