<span id="v.v.xxxiii-p1"></span> 32. Manifestly also in the Gospel we
find <span id="page_472">p. 472</span> <span
id="v.v.xxxiii-Page_472"></span>the mouth of the heart: so that in one
place the Lord is found to have mentioned the mouth both of the body and
of the heart, where he saith, “Are ye also yet without understanding? Do
ye not yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth, goeth
into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? but those things which
proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and they defile the
man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: these are the things
which defile a man.” <span id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356) Here if
thou understand but one mouth, that of the body, how wilt thou
understand, “Those things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth
from the heart;” since spitting also and vomiting proceed out of the
mouth? Unless peradventure a man is but then defiled when he eateth
aught unclean, but is defiled when he vomits it up. But if this be most
absurd, it remains that we understand the mouth of the heart to have
been expounded by the Lord, when He saith, “The things which proceed out
of the mouth, come forth from the heart.” For being that theft also can
be, and often is, perpetrated with silence of the bodily voice and
mouth; one must be out of his mind so to understand it as then to
account a person to be contaminated by the sin of theft, when he
confesses or makes it known, but when he commits it and holds his peace,
then to think him undefiled. But, in truth, if we refer what is said to
the mouth of the heart, no sin whatever can be committed tacitly: for it
is not committed unless it proceed from that mouth which is within.
