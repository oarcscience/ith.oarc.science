<span id="iv.v.x-p1"></span> 10. Although, even if there went before no
testimonies concerning Christ and the Church, whom ought it not to move
unto belief, that the Divine brightness hath on a sudden shone on the
human race, when we see, (the false gods now abandoned, and their images
every where broken in pieces, their temples overthrown or changed into
other uses, and so many vain rites plucked out by the roots from the
most inveterate usage of men,) the One True God invoked by all? And that
this hath been brought to pass-by One Man, by men mocked, seized, bound,
scourged, smitten with the palms of the hand, reviled, crucified, slain:
His disciples, (whom He chose common men, <span
id="fr_1684"></span>[1685](#fn_1684) and unlearned, and fishermen, and
publicans, that by their means His teaching might be set forth,)
proclaiming His Resurrection, His Ascension, which they asserted that
they had seen, and being filled with the Holy Ghost, sounded forth this
Gospel, in all tongues which they had not learned. And of them who heard
them, part believed, part, believing not, fiercely withstood them who
preached. Thus while they were faithful even unto death for the truth,
strove not by returning evil, but by enduring, overcame not by killing,
but by dying; thus was the world changed unto this religion, thus unto
this Gospel were the hearts of mortals turned, of men and women, of
small and great, of learned and unlearned, of wise and foolish, of
mighty and weak, of noble and ignoble, of high and low, and, throughout
all nations the Church shed abroad so increased, that even against the
Catholic faith itself there arises not any perverse sect, any kind of
error, which is found so to oppose itself to Christian truth, as that it
affect not and go not about to glory in the name of Christ: which very
error would not be suffered to spring up throughout the earth, were it
not that the very gainsaying exercised an wholesome discipline.
How <span id="fr_1685"></span>[1686](#fn_1685) would The Crucified have
availed so greatly, had He not been God <span id="page_343">p.
343</span> <span id="iv.v.x-Page_343"></span>that took upon Him Man,
even if He had through the Prophet foretold no such things to come? But
when now this so great mystery of godliness hath had its prophets and
heralds going before, by whose divine voices it was afore proclaimed;
and when it hath come in such manner as it was afore proclaimed, who is
there so mad as to assert that the Apostles lied concerning Christ, of
Whom they preached that He was come in such manner as the Prophets
foretold afore that He should come, which Prophets were not silent as to
true things to come concerning the Apostles themselves? For concerning
these they had said, “There is neither speech nor language, whereof
their voices are not heard; their sound went out into all the earth, and
their words unto the ends of the world.” <span
id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686) And this at any rate we see
fulfilled in the world, although we have not yet seen Christ in the
flesh. Who therefore, unless blinded by amazing madness, or hard and
steeled by amazing obstinacy, would be unwilling to put faith in the
sacred Scriptures, which have foretold the faith of the whole world?
