<span id="iv.ii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—The Distinction Between Faith and
Hope, and the Mutual Dependence of Faith, Hope, and Love.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.x-p2"></span>Again, can anything be hoped for which is
not an object of faith? It is true that a thing which is not an object
of hope may be believed. What true Christian, for example, does not
believe in the punishment of the wicked? And yet such an one does not
hope for it. And the man who believes that punishment to be hanging over
himself, and who shrinks in horror from the prospect, is more properly
said to fear than to hope. And these two states of mind the poet
carefully distinguishes, when he says: “Permit the fearful to have
hope.” <span id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097) Another poet, who is
usually much superior to this one, makes a wrong use of the word, when
he says: “If I have been able to hope for so great a grief as
this.” <span id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098) And some grammarians
take this case as an example of impropriety of speech, saying, “He said
*sperare* \[to hope\] instead of *timere* \[to fear\].” Accordingly,
faith may have for its object evil as well as good; for both good and
evil are believed, and the faith that believes them is not evil, but
good. Faith, moreover, is concerned with the past, the present, and the
future, all three. We believe, for example, that Christ died,—an event
in the past; we believe that He is sitting at the right hand of God,—a
state of things which is present; we believe that He will come to judge
the quick and the dead,—an event of the future. Again, faith applies
both to one’s own circumstances and those of others. Every one, for
example, believes that his own existence had a beginning, and was not
eternal, and he believes the same both of other men and other things.
Many of our beliefs in regard to religious matters, again, have
reference not merely to other men, but to angels also. But hope has for
its object only what is good, only what is future, and only what affects
the man who entertains the hope. For these reasons, then, faith must be
distinguished from hope, not merely as a matter of verbal propriety, but
because they are essentially different. The fact that we do not see
either what we believe or what we hope for, is all that is common to
faith and hope. In the Epistle to the Hebrews, for example, faith is
defined (and eminent defenders of the catholic faith have used the
definition as a standard) “the evidence of things not seen.” <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099) Although, should any one say that
he believes, that is, has grounded his faith, not on words, nor on
witnesses, nor on any reasoning whatever, but on the direct evidence of
his own senses, he would not be guilty of such an impropriety of speech
as to be justly liable to the criticism, “You saw, therefore you did not
believe.” And hence it does not follow that an object of faith is not an
object of sight. But it is better that we should use the word “faith” as
the Scriptures have taught us, applying it to those things which are not
seen. Concerning hope, again, the apostle says: “Hope that is seen is
not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope
for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.” <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100) When, then, we believe that good is
about to come, this is nothing else but to hope for it. Now what shall I
say of love? Without it, faith profits nothing; and in its absence, hope
cannot exist. The Apostle James says: “The devils also believe, and
tremble.” <span id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101) —that is, they,
having neither hope nor love, but believing that what we love and hope
for is about to come, are in terror. And so the Apostle Paul approves
and commends the “faith that worketh by love;” <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102) and this certainly cannot exist
without hope. Wherefore there is no love without hope, no hope without
love, and neither love nor hope without faith.
