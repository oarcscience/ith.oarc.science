<span id="iv.vii.ix-p1"></span> 9. Of His cross what shall I speak, what
say? This extremest kind of death He chose, that not any kind of death
might make His Martyrs afraid. The doctrine He shewed in His life as
Man, the example of patience He demonstrated in His Cross. There, you
have the work, that He was crucified; example of the work, the Cross;
reward of the work, Resurrection. He shewed us in the Cross what we
ought to endure, He shewed in the Resurrection what we have to hope.
Just like a consummate task-master in the matches of the arena, He said,
Do, and bear; do the work and receive the prize; strive in the match and
thou shall be crowned. What is the work? Obedience. What the prize?
Resurrection without death. Why did I add, “without death?” Because
“Lazarus rose, and died: Christ rose again, “dieth no more, death will
no longer have dominion over Him.” <span
