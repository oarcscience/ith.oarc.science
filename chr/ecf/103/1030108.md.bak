<span id="iv.i.ix.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.ix.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—Why the Son Chiefly is Intimated
in the Scriptures by the Name of Wisdom, While Both the Father and the
Holy Spirit are Wisdom. That the Holy Spirit, Together with the Father
and the Son, is One Wisdom.</span>

<span id="iv.i.ix.iii-p2"></span>4. Why, then, is scarcely anything ever
said in the Scriptures of wisdom, unless to show that it is begotten or
created of God?—begotten in the case of that Wisdom by which all things
are made; but created or made, as in men, when they are converted to
that Wisdom which is not created and made but begotten, and are so
enlightened; for in these men themselves there comes to be something
which may be called their wisdom: even as the Scriptures foretell or
narrate, that “the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;” <span
id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629.md) for in this way Christ was made
wisdom, because He was made man. Is it on this account that wisdom does
not speak in these books, nor is anything spoken of it, except to
declare that it is born of God, or made by Him (although the Father is
Himself wisdom), namely, because wisdom ought to be commended and
imitated by us, by the imitation of which we are fashioned \[rightly\]?
For the Father speaks it, that it may be His Word: yet not as a word
producing a sound proceeds from the mouth, or is thought before it is
pronounced. For this word is completed in certain spaces of time, but
that is eternal, and speaks to us by enlightening us, what ought to be
spoken to men, both of itself and of the Father. And therefore He says,
“No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
Him:” <span id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630.md) since the Father reveals
by the Son, that is, by His Word. For if that word which we utter, and
which is temporal and transitory, declares both itself, and that of
which we speak, how much more the Word of God, by which all things are
made? For this Word so declares the Father as He is the Father; because
both itself so is, and is that which is the Father, in so far as it is
wisdom and essence. For in so far as it is the Word, it is not what the
Father is; because the Word is not the Father, and Word is spoken
relatively, as is also Son, which assuredly is not the Father. And
therefore Christ is the power and wisdom of God, because He Himself,
being also power and wisdom, is from the Father, who is power and
wisdom; as He is light of the Father, who is light, and the fountain of
life with God the Father, who is Himself assuredly the fountain <span
id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span id="iv.i.ix.iii-Page_108"></span>of
life. For “with Thee,” He says, “is the fountain of life, and in Thy
light shall we see light.” <span id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631.md)
Because, “as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the
Son to have life in Himself:” <span id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632.md)
and, “He was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into
the world:” and this light, “the Word,” was “with God;” but “the Word
also was God;” <span id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633.md) and “God is
light, and in Him is no darkness at all:” <span
id="fr_634"></span>[635](#fn_634.md) but a light that is not corporeal, but
spiritual; yet not in such way spiritual, that it was wrought by
illumination, as it was said to the apostles, “Ye are the light of the
world,” <span id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635.md) but “the light which
lighteth every man,” that very supreme wisdom itself who is God, of whom
we now treat. The Son therefore is Wisdom of wisdom, namely the Father,
as He is Light of light, and God of God; so that both the Father singly
is light, and the Son singly is light; and the Father singly is God, and
the Son singly is God: therefore the Father also singly is wisdom, and
the Son singly is wisdom. And as both together are one light and one
God, so both are one wisdom. But the Son is “by God made unto us wisdom,
and righteousness, and sanctification;” <span
id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636.md) because we turn ourselves to Him in
time, that is, from some particular time, that we may remain with Him
for ever. And He Himself from a certain time was “the Word made flesh,
and dwelt among us.”

<span id="iv.i.ix.iii-p11"></span>5. On this account, then, when
anything concerning wisdom is declared or narrated in the Scriptures,
whether as itself speaking, or where anything is spoken of it, the Son
chiefly is intimated to us. And by the example of Him who is the image,
let us also not depart from God, since we also are the Image of God: not
indeed that which is equal to Him, since we are made so by the Father
through the Son, and not born of the Father, as that is. And we are so,
because we are enlightened with light; but that is so, because it is the
light that enlightens; and which, therefore, being without pattern, is
to us a pattern. For He does not imitate any one going before Him, in
respect to the Father, from whom He is never separable at all, since He
is the very same substance with Him from whom He is. But we by striving
imitate Him who abides, and follow Him who stands still, and walking in
Him, reach out towards Him; because He is made for us a way in time by
His humiliation, which is to us an eternal abiding-place by His
divinity. For since to pure intellectual spirits, who have not fallen
through pride, He gives an example in the form of God and as equal with
God and as God; so, in order that He might also give Himself as an
example of returning to fallen man who on account of the uncleanness of
sins and the punishment of mortality cannot see God, “He emptied
Himself;” not by changing His own divinity, but by assuming our
changeableness: and “taking upon Him the form of a servant” <span
id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637.md) He came to us into this world,” <span
id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md) who “was in this world,” because “the
world was made by Him;” <span id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) that He
might be an example upwards to those who see God, an example downwards
to those who admire man, an example to the sound to persevere, an
example to the sick to be made whole, an example to those who are to die
that they may not fear, an example to the dead that they may rise again,
“that in all things He might have the pre-eminence.” <span
id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md) So that, because man ought not to
follow any except God to blessedness, and yet cannot perceive God; by
following God made man, he might follow at once Him whom he could
perceive, and whom he ought to follow. Let us then love Him and cleave
to Him, by charity spread abroad in our hearts, through the Holy Spirit
which is given unto us. <span id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md) It is
not therefore to be wondered at, if, on account of the example which the
Image, which is equal to the Father, gives to us, in order that we may
be refashioned after the image of God, Scripture, when it speaks of
wisdom, speaks of the Son, whom we follow by living wisely; although the
Father also is wisdom, as He is both light and God.

<span id="iv.i.ix.iii-p17"></span>6. The Holy Spirit also, whether we
are to call Him that absolute love which joins together Father and Son,
and joins us also from beneath, that so that is not unfitly said which
is written, “God is love;” <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) how
is He not also Himself wisdom, since He is light, because “God is
light”? or whether after any other way the essence of the Holy Spirit is
to be singly and properly named; then, too, since He is God, He is
certainly light; and since He is light, He is certainly wisdom. But that
the Holy Spirit is God, Scripture proclaims by the apostle, who says,
“Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?” and immediately subjoins,
“And the Spirit of God dwelleth in you;” <span
id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) for God dwelleth in His own temple.
For the Spirit of God does not dwell in the temple of God as a servant,
since he says more plainly in another place, “Know ye not that your body
is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, and which ye have of
God, and ye are not your own? <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> <span
id="iv.i.ix.iii-Page_109"></span>For ye are bought with a great price:
therefore glorify God in your body.” <span
id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) But what is wisdom, except spiritual
and unchangeable light? For yonder sun also is light, but it is
corporeal; and the spiritual creature also is light, but it is not
unchangeable. Therefore the Father is light, the Son is light, and the
Holy Spirit is light; but together not three lights, but one light. And
so the Father is wisdom, the Son is wisdom, and the Holy Spirit is
wisdom, and together not three wisdoms, but one wisdom: and because in
the Trinity to be is the same as to be wise, the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit, are one essence. Neither in the Trinity is it one thing to be
and another to be God; therefore the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, are
one God.
