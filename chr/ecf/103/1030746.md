<span id="v.vii.xv-p1"></span> 14. Here peradventure some man may <span
id="page_511">p. 511</span> <span id="v.vii.xv-Page_511"></span>say, “If
it was bodily work that the Apostle wrought, whereby to sustain this
life, what was that same work, and when did he find time for it, both to
work and to preach the Gospel?” To whom I answer: Suppose I do not know;
nevertheless that he did bodily work, and thereby lived in the flesh,
and did not use the power which the Lord had given to the Apostles, that
preaching the Gospel he should live by the Gospel, those things
above-said do without all doubt bear witness. For it is not either in
one place or briefly said, that it should be possible for any most
astute arguer with all his tergiversation to traduce and pervert it to
another meaning. Since then so great an authority, with so mighty and so
frequent blows mauling the gainsayers, doth break in pieces their
contrariness, why ask they of me either what sort of work he did, or
when he did it? One thing I know, that he neither did steal, nor was a
housebreaker or highwayman, nor chariot-driver or hunter or player, nor
given to filthy lucre: but innocently and honestly wrought things which
are fitted for the uses of men; such as are the works of carpenters,
builders, shoemakers, peasants, and such like. For honesty itself
reprehends not what their pride doth reprehend, who love to be called,
but love not to be, honest. The Apostle then would not disdain either to
take in hand any work of peasants, or to be employed in the labor of
craftsmen. For he who saith, “Be ye without offense to Jews and to
Greeks and to the Church of God,” <span
id="fr_2514"></span>[2515](#fn_2514.md) before what men he could possibly
stand abashed, I know not. If they shall say, the Jews; the Patriarchs
fed cattle: if the Greeks, whom we call also Pagans; they have had
philosophers, held in high honor, who were shoemakers: if the Church of
God; that just man, elect to the testimony of a conjugal and ever-during
virginity, to whom was betrothed the Virgin Mary who bore Christ, was a
carpenter. <span id="fr_2515"></span>[2516](#fn_2515.md) Whatever therefore
of these with innocence and without fraud men do work, is good. For the
Apostle himself takes precaution of this, that no man through necessity
of sustaining life should turn aside to evil works. “Let him that
stole,” saith he, “steal no more; but rather let him labor good with his
hands, that he may have to impart to him that needeth.” <span
id="fr_2516"></span>[2517](#fn_2516.md) This then is enough to know, that
also in the very work of the body the Apostle did work that which is
good.
