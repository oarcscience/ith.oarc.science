<span id="iv.i.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—All are Sometimes Understood in
One Person.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iii.ix-p2"></span>But this is said, not on account of any
inequality of the Word of God and of the Holy Spirit, but as though the
presence of the Son of man with them would be a hindrance to the coming
of Him, who was not less, because He did not “empty Himself, taking upon
Him the form of a servant,” <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) as
the Son did. It was necessary, then, that the form of a servant should
be taken away from their eyes, because, through gazing upon it, they
thought that alone which they saw to be Christ. Hence also is that which
is said, “If ye loved me, ye would rejoice because I said, ‘I go unto
the Father; for my Father is greater than I:’” <span
id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md) that is, on that account it is
necessary for me to go to the Father, because, whilst you see me thus,
you hold me to be less than the Father through that which you see; and
so, being taken up with the creature and the “fashion” which I have
taken upon me, you do not perceive the equality which I have with the
Father. Hence, too, is this: “Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to
my Father.” <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) For touch, as it
were, puts a limit to their conception, and He therefore would not have
the thought of the heart, directed towards Himself, to be so limited as
that He should be held to be only that which He seemed to be. But the
“ascension to the Father” meant, so to appear as He is equal to the
Father, that the limit of the sight which sufficeth us might be attained
there. Sometimes also it is said of the Son alone, that He himself
sufficeth, and the whole reward of our love and longing is held forth as
in the sight of Him. For so it is said, “He that hath my commandments,
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me shall
be loved of my Father; and I will love him, and will manifest myself to
him.” <span id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) Pray, because He has not
here said, And I will show the Father also to him, has He therefore
excluded the Father? On the contrary, because it is true, “I and my
Father are one,” when the Father is manifested, the Son also, who is in
Him, is manifested; and when the Son is manifested, the Father also, who
is in Him, is manifested. As, therefore, when it is said, “And I will
manifest myself to him,” it is understood that He manifests also the
Father; so likewise in that which is said, “When He shall have delivered
up the kingdom to God, even the Father,” it is understood that He does
not take it away from Himself; since, when He shall bring believers to
the contemplation of God, even the Father, doubtless He will bring them
to the contemplation of Himself, who has said, “And I will manifest
myself to him.” And so, consequently, when Judas had said to Him, “Lord,
how is it that Thou wilt manifest Thyself unto us, and not unto the
world?” Jesus answered and said to him, “If a man love me, he will keep
my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and
make our abode with him.” <span id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md)
Behold, that He manifests not only Himself to him by whom He is loved,
because He comes to him together with the Father, and abides with him.

<span id="iv.i.iii.ix-p8"></span>19. Will it perhaps be thought, that
when the Father and the Son make their abode with him who loves them,
the Holy Spirit <span id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-Page_28"></span>is excluded from that abode? What, then,
is that which is said above of the Holy Spirit: “Whom the world cannot
receive, because it seeth Him not: but ye know Him; for He abideth with
you, and is in you”? He, therefore, is not excluded from that abode, of
whom it is said, “He abideth with you, and is in you;” unless, perhaps,
any one be so senseless as to think, that when the Father and the Son
have come that they may make their abode with him who loves them, the
Holy Spirit will depart thence, and (as it were) give place to those who
are greater. But the Scripture itself meets this carnal idea; for it
says a little above: “I will pray the Father, and He shall give you
another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever.” <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) He will not therefore depart when the
Father and the Son come, but will be in the same abode with them
eternally; because neither will He come without them, nor they without
Him. But in order to intimate the Trinity, some things are separately
affirmed, the Persons being also each severally named; and yet are not
to be understood as though the other Persons were excluded, on account
of the unity of the same Trinity and the One substance and Godhead of
the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. <span

<span id="iv.i.iii.ix-p10"></span> \[An act belonging eminently and
officially to a particular trinitarian person is not performed to the
total *exclusion* of the other persons, because of the numerical unity
of essence. The whole undivided essence is in each person; consequently,
what the essence in one of its personal modes, or forms, does officially
and eminently, is participated in by the essence in its other modes or
forms. Hence the interchange of persons in Scripture. Though creation is
officially the Father’s work, yet the Son creates ([Col.
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md), [Heb.
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p10.1"></span>[Col. i.
16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p10.2"></span>; [Heb. i.
3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p10.3"></span>). The name Saviour is given to the Father
([1 Tim. 1.1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p10.4"></span>[1 Tim. i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p10.5"></span>). Judgment belongs officially to the Son
([John 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md), [Matt.
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p10.6"></span>[John v.
22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p10.7"></span>; [Matt xxv.
31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p10.8"></span>); yet the Father judgeth ([1 Pet.
1.17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p10.9"></span>[1 Pet. i.
17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p10.10"></span>). The Father raises Christ ([Acts
13.30](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p10.11"></span>[Acts xiii.
30](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p10.12"></span>); yet Christ raises himself ([John

10:41](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#041.md), [Rom.
