<span id="iv.i.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Of the Appearance in the Pillar
of Cloud and of Fire.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.xv-p2"></span>24. Also in the going forth of the
children of Israel from Egypt it is written, “And the Lord went before
them, by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way, and by night in
a pillar of fire. He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor
the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.” <span
id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) Who here, too, would doubt that God
appeared to the eyes of mortal men by the corporeal creature made
subject to Him, and not by His own substance? But it is not similarly
apparent whether the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit, or the
Trinity itself, the one God. Nor is this distinguished there either, in
my judgment, where it is written, “The glory of the Lord appeared in the
cloud, and the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, I have heard the
murmurings of the children of Israel,” <span
