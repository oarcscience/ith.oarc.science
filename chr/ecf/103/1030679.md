<span id="v.v.xxxvi-p1"></span> 35. Moreover what is written “Thou wilt
destroy all that speak leasing:” <span
id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359) one saith that no lie is here
excepted, but all condemned. Another saith: Yea verily: but they who
speak leasing from the heart, as we disputed above; for that man
speaketh truth in his heart, who hateth the necessity of lying, which he
understands as a penalty of the moral life. Another saith: All indeed
will God destroy who speak leasing, but not all leasing: for there is
some leasing which the Prophet was at that time insinuating, in which
none is spared; that is, if refusing to confess each one his sins, he
defend them rather, and will not do penance, <span
id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360) so that not content to work
iniquity, he must needs wish to be thought just, and succumb not to the
medicine of confession: as the very distinction of the words may seem to
intimate no other, “Thou hatest all that work iniquity;” <span
id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361) but wilt not destroy them if upon
repenting they speak the truth in confession, that by doing that truth
they may come to the light; as is said in the Gospel according to John,
“But be that doeth truth cometh unto the light. <span
id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362) Thou wilt destroy all who” not only
work what Thou hatest, but also “speak leasing;” <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363) in holding out before them false
righteousness, and not confessing their sins in penitence.
