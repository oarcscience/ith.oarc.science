<span id="v.vi.xxxii-p1"></span> 31. But he who says that some lies are
just, must be judged to say no other than that some sins are just, and
therefore some things are just which are unjust: than which what can be
more absurd? For whence is a thing a sin, but for that it is contrary to
justice? Be it said then that some sins are great, some small, because
it is true; and let us not listen to the Stoics who maintain all to be
equal: but to say that some sins are unjust, some just, what else is it
than to say that there be some unjust, some just iniquities? When the
Apostle John saith, “Every man who doeth sin, doeth also iniquity and
sin is iniquity.” <span id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440.md) It is
impossible therefore that a sin should be just, unless when we put the
name of sin upon another thing in which one doth not sin, but either
doeth or suffereth aught for sin. Namely, both sacrifices for sins are
named “sins,” and the punishments of sins are sometimes called sins.
These doubtless can be understood to be just sins, when just sacrifices
are spoken of, or just punishments. But those things which are done
against God’s law cannot be just. It is said unto God, “Thy law is
truth:” <span id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441.md) and consequently,
what is against truth cannot be just. Now who can doubt that every lie
is against truth? Therefore there can be no just lie. Again, what man
doth not see clearly that every thing which is just is of the truth? And
John crieth out, “No lie is of the truth.” <span
id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md) No lie therefore is just.
Wherefore, when from holy Scriptures are proposed to us examples of
lying, either they are not lies, but are thought to be so while they are
not understood; or, if lies they be, they are not meet to be imitated,
because they cannot be just.
