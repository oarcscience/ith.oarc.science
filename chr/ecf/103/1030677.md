<span id="v.v.xxxiv-p1"></span> 33. But, like as it is asked of what
mouth the Scripture saith, “The mouth that lieth, slayeth the soul,” so
it may be asked, of what lie. For it seems to speak of that lie in
particular, which consists in detraction. It says, “Keep yourselves from
murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and from detraction refrain your
tongue.” Now this detraction takes place through malevolence, when any
man not only with mouth and voice of the body doth utter what he forgeth
against any, but even without speaking wisheth him to be thought such;
which is in truth to detract with the mouth of the heart; which thing,
it saith, cannot be obscure and hidden from God.
