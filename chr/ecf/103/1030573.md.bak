<span id="v.iii.xx-p1"></span> 19. But lest any should think that of two
works, the good and the better, the rewards will be equal, on this
account it was necessary to treat against those, who have so interpreted
that saying of the Apostle, “But I think that this is good by reason of
the present necessity,” <span id="fr_2055"></span>[2056](#fn_2055.md) as to
say that virginity is of use not in order to the kingdom of heaven, but
in order to this present time: as though in that eternal life, they, who
had chosen this better part, would have nothing more than the rest of
men. And in this discussion when we came to that saying of the same
Apostle, “But such shall have tribulation of the flesh, but I spare
you;” <span id="fr_2056"></span>[2057](#fn_2056.md) we fell in with other
disputants, who so far from making marriage equal to perpetual
virginity, altogether condemned it. For whereas both are errors, either
to equal marriage to holy virginity, or to condemn it: by fleeing from
one another to excess, these two errors come into open collision, in
that they have been unwilling to hold the mean of truth: whereby, both
by sure reason and authority of holy Scriptures, we both discover that
marriage is not a sin, and yet equal it not to the good either of
virginal or even of widowed chastity. Some forsooth by aiming at
virginity, have thought marriage hateful even as adultery: but others,
by defending marriage, would have the excellence of perpetual continence
to deserve nothing more than married chastity; as though either the good
of Susanna be the lowering of Mary: or the greater good of Mary ought to
be the condemnation of Susanna.
