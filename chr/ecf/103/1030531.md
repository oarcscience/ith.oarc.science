<span id="v.ii.xv-p1"></span> 14. And not without just cause a doubt is
raised, whether he said this of all married women, or of such as so many
are, as that nearly all may be thought so to be. For neither doth that,
which he saith of unmarried women, “She, that is unmarried, thinkest of
the things of the Lord, to be holy both in body and spirit:” <span
id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972.md) pertain unto all unmarried women:
whereas there are certain widows who are dead, who live in delights.
However, so far as regards a certain distinction and, as it were,
character of their own, of the unmarried and married; as she deserves
the excess of hatred, who containing from marriage, <span
id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973.md) that is, from a thing allowed, does
not contain from offenses, either of luxury, or pride, or curiosity and
prating; so the married woman is seldom met with, who, in the very
obedience of married life, hath no thought save how to please God, by
adorning herself, not with plaited hair, or gold and pearls and costly
attire, <span id="fr_1974"></span>[1975](#fn_1974.md) but as becometh women
making profession of piety, through a good conversation. Such marriages,
forsooth, the Apostle Peter also describes by giving commandment. “In
like manner,” saith he, “wives obeying their own husbands; in order
that, even if any obey not the word, they may be gained without
discourse through the conversation of the wives, seeing your fear and
chaste conversation: that they be not they that are adorned without with
crispings of hair, or clothed with gold or with fair raiment; but that
hidden man of your heart, in that unbroken continuance of a quiet and
modest spirit, which before the Lord also is rich. For thus certain holy
women, who hoped in the Lord, used to adorn themselves, obeying their
own husbands: as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord: whose daughters
ye are become, when ye do well, and fear not with any vain fear.
Husbands in like manner living at peace and in chastity with your wives,
both give ye honor as to the weaker and subject vessel, as with co-heirs
of grace, and see that your prayers be not hindered.” <span
id="fr_1975"></span>[1976](#fn_1975.md) Is it indeed that such marriages
have no thought of the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord? But
they are very rare: who denies this? And, being, as they are, rare,
nearly all the persons who are such, were not joined together in order
to be such, but being already joined together became such.
