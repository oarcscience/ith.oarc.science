id="iv.ii.lxxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 87.—The Case of Monstrous
Births.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxxix-p2"></span>We are not justified in affirming even
of monstrosities, which are born and live, however quickly they may die,
that they shall not rise again, nor that they shall rise again in their
deformity, and not rather with an amended and perfected body. God forbid
that the double limbed man who was lately born in the East, of whom an
account was brought by most trustworthy brethren who had seen him,—an
account which the presbyter Jerome, of blessed memory, left in
writing; <span id="fr_1266"></span>[1267](#fn_1266.md) —God forbid, I say,
that we should think that at the resurrection there shall be one man
with double limbs, and not two distinct men, as would have been the case
had twins been born. And so other births, which, because they have
either a superfluity or a defect, or because they are very much
deformed, are called *monstrosities*, shall at the resurrection be
restored to the normal shape of man; and so each single soul shall
possess its own body; and no bodies shall cohere together even though
they were born in cohesion, but each separately shall possess all the
members which constitute a complete human body.

<span id="iv.ii.lxxxix-p3"></span> Jerome, in his *Epistle to Vitalis*:
“Or because in our times a man was born at Lydda with two heads, four
hands, one belly, and two feet, does it necessarily follow that all men
are so born?”
