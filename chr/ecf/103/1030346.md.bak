id="iv.ii.xcviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 96.—The Omnipotent God Does Well
Even in the Permission of Evil.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xcviii-p2"></span>Nor can we doubt that God does well
even in the permission of what is evil. For He permits it only in the
justice of His judgment. And surely all that is just is good. Although,
therefore, evil, in so far as it is evil, is not a good; yet the fact
that evil as well as good exists, is a good. For if it were not a good
that evil should exist, its existence would not be permitted by the
omnipotent Good, who without doubt can as easily refuse to permit what
He does not wish, as bring about what He does wish. And if we do not
believe this, the very first sentence of our creed is endangered,
wherein we profess to believe in God the Father Almighty. For He is not
truly called Almighty if He cannot do whatsoever He pleases, or if the
power of His almighty will is hindered by the will of any creature
whatsoever.
