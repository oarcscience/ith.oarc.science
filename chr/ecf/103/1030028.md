<span id="iv.i.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—The Creature is Not So Taken by
the Holy Spirit as Flesh is by the Word.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.vii-p2"></span>11. It is, then, for this reason
nowhere written, that the Father is greater than the Holy Spirit, or
that the Holy Spirit is less than God the Father, because the creature
in which the Holy Spirit was to appear was not taken in the same way as
the Son of man was taken, as the form in which the person of the Word of
God Himself should be set forth not that He might possess the word of
God, as other holy and wise men have possessed it, but “above His
fellows;” <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) not certainly that He
possessed the word more than they, so as to be of more surpassing wisdom
than the rest were, but that He was the very Word Himself. For the word
in the flesh is one thing, and the Word made flesh is another; *i.e.*
the word in man is one thing, the Word that is man is another. For flesh
is put for man, where it is said, “The Word was made flesh;” <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) and again, “And all flesh shall see
the salvation of God.” <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) For it
does not mean flesh without soul and without mind; but “all flesh,” is
the same as if it were said, every man. The creature, then, in which the
Holy Spirit should appear, was not so taken, as that flesh and human
form were taken, of the Virgin Mary. For the Spirit did not beatify the
dove, or the wind, or the fire, and join them for ever to Himself and to
His person in unity and “fashion.” <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) Nor, again, is the nature of the Holy
Spirit mutable and changeable; so that these things were not made of the
creature, but He himself was turned and changed first into one and then
into another, as water is changed into ice. But these things appeared at
the seasons at which they ought to have appeared, the creature serving
the Creator, and being changed and converted at the command of Him who
remains immutably in Himself, in order to signify and manifest Him in
such way as it was fit He should be signified and manifested to mortal
men. Accordingly, although that dove is called the Spirit; <span
id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) and in speaking of that fire, “There
appeared unto them,” he says, “cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it
sat upon each of them; and they began to speak with other tongues, as
the Spirit gave them utterance; <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md)
in order to show that the Spirit was manifested by that fire, as by the
dove; yet we cannot call the Holy Spirit both God and a dove, or both
God and fire, in the same way as we call the Son both God and man; nor
as we call the Son the Lamb of God; which not only John the Baptist
says, “Behold the Lamb of God,” <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md)
but also John the Evangelist sees the Lamb slain in the
Apocalypse. <span id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) For that prophetic
vision was not shown to bodily eyes through bodily forms, but in the
spirit through spiritual images of bodily things. But whosoever saw that
dove and that fire, saw them with their eyes. Although it may perhaps be
disputed concerning the fire, whether it was seen by the eyes or in the
spirit, on account of the form of the sentence. For the text does not
say, They saw cloven tongues like fire, but, “There appeared to them.”
But we are not wont to say with the same meaning, It appeared to me; as
we say, I saw. And in those spiritual visions of corporeal images the
usual expressions are, both, It appeared to me; and, I saw: but in those
things which are shown to the eyes through express corporeal forms, the
common expression is not, It appeared to me; but, I saw. There may,
therefore, be a question raised respecting that fire, how it was seen;
whether within in the spirit as it were outwardly, or really outwardly
before the eyes of the flesh. But of that dove, which is said to have
descended in a bodily form, no one ever doubted that it was seen by the
eyes. Nor, again, as we call the Son a Rock (for it is written, “And
that Rock was Christ” <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252) .md), can we
so call the Spirit a dove or fire. For that rock was a thing already
created, and after the mode of its action was <span id="page_43">p.
43</span> <span id="iv.i.iv.vii-Page_43"></span>called by the name of
Christ, whom it signified; like the stone placed under Jacob’s head, and
also anointed, which he took in order to signify the Lord; <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) or as Isaac was Christ, when he
carried the wood for the sacrifice of himself. <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) A particular significative action was
added to those already existing things; they did not, as that dove and
fire, suddenly come into being in order simply so to signify. The dove
and the fire, indeed, seem to me more like that flame which appeared to
Moses in the bush, <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) or that
pillar which the people followed in the wilderness, <span
id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) or the thunders and lightnings which
came when the Law was given in the mount. <span
id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) For the corporeal form of these things
came into being for the very purpose, that it might signify something,
and then pass away. <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md)

variety in the terms by which St. Paul describes the incarnation is very
striking. The person incarnated subsists first in a “form of God;” he
then takes along with this (still retaining this) a “form of a servant;”
which form of a servant is a “likeness of men;” which likeness of men is
a “scheme” (A.V. “fashion”) or external form of a man.—W.G.T.S.\]

appeared in the form of a dove, he did not unite himself with it. The
dove did not constitute an integral part of the divine person who
employed it. Nor did the illuminated vapor in the theophany of the
Shekinah. But when the Logos appeared in the form of a man, he united
himself with it, so that it became a constituent part of his person. A
theophany, as Augustin notices, is temporary and transient. The
incarnation is perpetual.—W.G.T.S.\]
