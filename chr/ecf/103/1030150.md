<span id="iv.i.xiii-p3"></span>A kind of image of the Trinity is pointed
out, even in the outer man; first of all, in those things which are
perceived from without, viz. in the bodily object that is seen, and in
the form that is impressed by it upon the sight of the seer, and in the
purpose of the will that combines the two; although these three are
neither mutually equal, nor of one substance. Next, a kind of trinity,
in three somewhats of one substance, is observed to exist in the mind
itself, as it were introduced there from those things that are perceived
from without; viz. the image of the bodily object which is in the
memory, and the impression formed therefrom when the mind’s eye of the
thinker is turned to it, and the purpose of the will combining both. And
this latter trinity is also said to pertain to the outer man, in that it
is introduced into the mind from bodily objects, which are perceived
from without.
