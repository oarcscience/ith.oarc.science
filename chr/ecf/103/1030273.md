id="iv.ii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Summary of the Results of the
Preceding Discussion.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxv-p2"></span>As it is right that we should know the
causes of good and evil, so much of them at least as will suffice for
the way that leads us to the kingdom, where there will be life without
the shadow of death, truth without any alloy of error, and happiness
unbroken by any sorrow, I have discussed these subjects with the brevity
which my limited space demanded. And I think there cannot now be any
doubt, that the only cause of any good that we enjoy is the goodness of
God, and that the only cause of evil is the falling away from the
unchangeable good of a being made good but changeable, first in the case
of an angel, and afterwards in the case of man.
