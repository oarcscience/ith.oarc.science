id="iv.ii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Every Error is Not a Sin. An
Examination of the Opinion of the Academic Philosophers, that to Avoid
Error We Should in All Cases Suspend Belief.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxii-p2"></span>I am not sure whether mistakes such as
the following,—when one forms a good opinion of a bad man, not knowing
what sort of man he is; or when, instead of the ordinary perceptions
through the bodily senses, other appearances of a similar kind present
themselves, which we perceive in the spirit, but think we perceive in
the body, or perceive in the body, but think we perceive in the spirit
(such a mistake as the Apostle Peter made when the angel suddenly freed
him from his chains and imprisonment, and he thought he saw a
vision <span id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112) .md); or when, in the
case of sensible objects themselves, we mistake rough for smooth, or
bitter for sweet, or think that putrid matter has a good smell; or when
we mistake the passing of a carriage for thunder; or mistake one man for
another, the two being very much alike, as often happens in the case of
twins (hence our great poet calls it “a mistake pleasing to
parents” <span id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113) .md),—whether these,
and other mistakes of this kind, ought to be called sins. Nor do I now
undertake to solve a very knotty question, which perplexed those very
acute thinkers, the Academic philosophers: whether a wise man ought to
give his assent to anything, seeing that he may fall into error by
assenting to falsehood: for all things, as they assert, are either
unknown or uncertain. Now I wrote three volumes shortly after my
conversion, to remove out of my way the objections which lie, as it
were, on the very threshold of faith. And assuredly it was necessary at
the very outset to remove this utter despair of reaching truth, which
seems to be strengthened by the arguments of these philosophers. Now in
their eyes every error is regarded as a sin, and they think that error
can only be avoided by entirely suspending belief. For they say that the
man who assents to what is uncertain falls into error; and they strive
by the most acute, but most audacious arguments, to show that, even
though a man’s opinion should by chance be true, yet that there is no
certainty of its truth, owing to the impossibility of distinguishing
truth from falsehood. But with us, “the just shall live by faith.” <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114.md) Now, if assent be taken away, faith
goes too; for without assent there can be no belief. And there are
truths, whether we know them or not, which must be believed if we would
attain to a happy life, that is, to eternal life. But I am not sure
whether one ought to argue with men who not only do not know that there
is an eternal life before them, but do not know whether they are living
at the present moment; nay, say that they do not know what it is
impossible they can be ignorant of. For it is impossible that any one
should be ignorant that he is alive, seeing that if he be not alive it
is impossible for him to be ignorant; for not knowledge merely, but
ignorance too, can be an attribute only of the living. But, forsooth,
they think that by not acknowledging that they are alive they avoid
error, when even their very error proves that they are alive, since one
who is not alive cannot err. As, then, it is not only true, but certain,
that we are alive, so there are many other things both true and certain;
and God forbid that it should ever be called wisdom, and not the height
of folly, to refuse assent to these.
