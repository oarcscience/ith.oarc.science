<span id="v.vii.xxi-p1"></span> 20. For what these men are about, who
will not do bodily work, to what thing they give up their time, I should
like to know. “To prayers,” say they, “and psalms, and reading, and the
word of God.” A holy life, unquestionably, and in sweetness of Christ
worthy of praise; but then, if from these we are not to be called off,
neither must we eat, nor our daily viands themselves be prepared, that
they may be put before us and taken. Now if to find time for these
things the servants of God at certain intervals of times by very
infirmity are of necessity compelled, why do we not make account of some
portions of times to be allotted also to the observance of Apostolical
precepts? For one single prayer of one who obeyeth is sooner heard than
ten thousand of a despiser. As for divine songs, however, they can
easily, even while working with their hands, say them, and like as
rowers with a boat-song, <span id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540.md) so
with godly melody cheer up their very toil. Or are we ignorant how it is
with all workmen, to what vanities, and for the most part even
filthinesses, of theatrical fables they give their hearts and tongues,
while their hands recede not from their work? What then hinders a
servant of God while working with his hands to meditate in the law of
the Lord, and sing unto the Name of the Lord Most High? <span
id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541.md) provided, of course, that to learn
what he may by memory rehearse, he have times set apart. For to this end
also those good works of the faithful ought not to be lacking, for
resource of making up what is necessary, that the hours which are so
taken up in storing of the mind that those bodily works cannot be
carried on, may not oppress with want. But they which say that they give
up their time to reading, do they not there find that which the Apostle
enjoineth? Then what perversity is this, to refuse to be ruled by his
reading while he wishes to give up his time thereto; and that he may
spend more time in reading what is good, therefore to refuse to do what
is read? For who knows not that each doth the more quickly profit when
he reads good things, the quicker he is in doing what he reads?
