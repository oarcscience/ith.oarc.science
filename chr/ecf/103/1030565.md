<span id="v.iii.xii-p1"></span> 11. Nor do we ourselves set forth this
in virgins, that they are virgins; but that they are virgins dedicated
unto God by pious continence. For it is not at a venture that I may say,
a married woman seems to me happier than a virgin about to be married:
for the one hath what the other as yet desires, especially if she be not
yet even the betrothed of any one. The one studies to please one, unto
whom she hath been given; the other many, in doubt unto whom she is to
be given: by this one thing she guards modesty of thought from the
crowd, that she is seeking, not an adulterer, but a husband, in the
crowd. Therefore that virgin is with good reason set before a married
woman, who neither sets herself forth for the multitude to love, whereas
she seeks from out the multitude the love of one; nor, having now found
him, orders herself <span id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039.md) for one,
taking thought of the things of the world, “how to please her
husband;” <span id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040.md) but hath so loved
“Him of fair beauty above the sons of men,” <span
id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041.md) as that, because she could not,
even as Mary, conceive Him in her flesh, she hath kept her flesh also
virgin for Him conceived in her heart. This kind of virgins no
fruitfulness of the body hath given birth to: this is no progeny of
flesh and blood. If of these the mother be sought for, it is the Church.
None bears sacred virgins save a sacred virgin, she who hath been
espoused to be presented chaste unto one Husband, Christ. <span
id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042.md) Of her, not altogether in body, but
altogether in spirit virgin, are born holy virgins both in body and in
spirit.
