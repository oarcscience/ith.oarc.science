id="iv.i.viii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—God is a Trinity, But Not
Triple (Triplex).</span>

<span id="iv.i.viii.vii-p2"></span>But God is truly called in manifold
ways, great, good, wise, blessed, true, and whatsoever other thing seems
to be said of Him not unworthily: but His greatness is the same as His
wisdom; for He is not great by bulk, but by power; and His goodness is
the same as His wisdom and greatness, and His truth the same as all
those things; and in Him it is not one thing to be blessed, and another
to be great, or wise, or true, or good, or in a word to be Himself.

<span id="iv.i.viii.vii-p3"></span>9. Neither, since He is a Trinity, is
He therefore to be thought triple (*triplex*) <span
id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614.md) otherwise the Father alone, or the Son
alone, will be less than the Father and Son together. Although, indeed,
it is hard to see how we can say, either the Father alone, or the Son
alone; since both the Father is with the Son, and the Son with the
Father, always and inseparably: not that both are the Father, or both
are the Son; but because they are always one in relation to the other,
and neither the one nor the other alone. But because we call even the
Trinity itself God alone, although He is always with holy spirits and
souls, but say that He only is God, because they are not also God with
Him; so we call the Father the Father alone, not because He is separate
from the Son, but because they are not both together the Father.

<span id="iv.i.viii.vii-p4"></span> \[The Divine Unity is trinal, not
triple. The triple is composed of three different substances. It has
parts, and is complex. The trinal is without parts, and is incomplex. It
denotes one simple substance in three modes or forms. “We may speak of
the trinal, but not of the triple deity.” Hollaz, in Hase’s *Hutterus*,
172.—W.G.T.S.\]
