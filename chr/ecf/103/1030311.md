id="iv.ii.lxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 61.—The Church on Earth Has Been
Redeemed from Sin by the Blood of a Mediator.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxiii-p2"></span>This part of the Church, then, which is
made up of the holy angels and the hosts of God, shall become known to
us in its true nature, when, at the end of the world, we shall be united
with it in the common possession of everlasting happiness. But the other
part, which, separated from it, wanders as a stranger on the earth, is
better known to us, both because we belong to it, and because it is
composed of men, and we too are men. This section of the Church has been
redeemed from all sin by the blood of a Mediator who had no sin, and its
song is: “If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not
His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all.” <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202.md) Now it was not for the angels that
Christ died. Yet what was done for the redemption of man through His
death was in a sense done for the angels, because the enmity which sin
had put between men and the holy angels is removed, and friendship is
restored between them, and by the redemption of man the gaps which the
great apostasy left in the angelic host are filled up.
