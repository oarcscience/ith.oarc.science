<span id="iv.i.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—What the Doctrine of the
Catholic Faith is Concerning the Trinity.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iii.iv-p2"></span>7. All those Catholic expounders of the
divine Scriptures, both Old and New, whom I have been able to read, who
have written before me concerning the Trinity, Who is God, have purposed
to teach, according to the Scriptures, this doctrine, that the Father,
and the Son, and the Holy Spirit intimate a divine unity of one and the
same substance in an indivisible equality; <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24) and therefore that they are not three
Gods, but one God: although the Father hath begotten the Son, and so He
who is the Father is not the Son; and the Son is begotten by the Father,
and so He who is the Son is not the Father; and the Holy Spirit is
neither the Father nor the Son, but only the Spirit of the Father and of
the Son, Himself also co-equal with the Father and the Son, and
pertaining to the unity of the Trinity. Yet not that this Trinity was
born of the Virgin Mary, and crucified under Pontius Pilate, and buried,
and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven, but only the
Son. Nor, again, that this Trinity descended in the form of a dove upon
Jesus when He was baptized; <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25) nor
that, on the day of Pentecost, after the ascension of the Lord, when
“there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind,” <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26) the same Trinity “sat upon each of them
with cloven tongues like as of fire,” but only the Holy Spirit. Nor yet
that this Trinity said from heaven, “Thou art my Son,” <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27) whether when He was baptized by John, or
when the three disciples were with Him in the mount, <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28) or when the voice sounded, saying, “I
have both glorified it, and will glorify it again;” <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29) but that it was a word of the Father
only, spoken to the Son; although the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Spirit, as they are indivisible, so work indivisibly. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30) This is also my faith, since it is the
Catholic faith.

<span id="iv.i.iii.iv-p3"></span> \[Augustin teaches the Nicene doctrine
of a numerical unity of essence in distinction from a specific unity.
The latter is that of mankind. In this case there is *division* of
substance—part after part of the specific nature being separated and
formed, by propagation, into individuals. No human individual contains
the whole specific nature. But in the case of the numerical unity of the
Trinity, there is no division of essence. The whole divine nature is in
each divine person. The three divine persons do not constitute a
species—that is, three divine individuals made by the division and
distribution of one common divine nature—but are three modes or “forms”

essence in all three modes. The term Father (or Son, or Spirit) denotes
the essence in only one mode. Consequently, there is something in the
Trinity that cannot be attributed to any one of the Persons, as such;
and something in a Person that cannot be attributed to the Trinity, as
such. Trinality cannot be ascribed to the first Person; paternity cannot
be ascribed to the Trinity.—W.G.T.S.\]
