<span id="vi.v.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—An Examination of the Question as
to How It Was Possible for Them to Go Up, According to Luke’s Statement,
with Him to Jerusalem to the Temple, When the Days of the Purification
of the Mother of Christ Were Accomplished, in Order to Perform the Usual
Rites, If It is Correctly Recorded by Matthew, that Herod Had Already
Learned from the Wise Men that the Child Was Born in Whose Stead, When
He Sought for Him, He Slew So Many Children.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xii-p2"></span>24. Hereby also we see how another
question is solved, if any one indeed finds a difficulty in it. I allude
to the question as to how it was possible, on the supposition that the
elder Herod was already anxious (to obtain information regarding Him),
and agitated by the intelligence received from the wise men concerning
the birth of the King of the Jews, for them, when the days of the
purification of His mother were accomplished, to go up in any safety
with Him to the temple, in order to see to the performance of those
things which were according to the law of the Lord, and which are
specified by Luke. <span id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md) For who can
fail to perceive that this solitary day might very easily have escaped
the notice of a king, whose attention was engaged with a multitude of
affairs? Or if it does not appear probable that Herod, who was waiting
in the extremest anxiety to see what report the wise men would bring
back to him concerning the child, should have been so long in finding
out how he had been mocked, that, only after the mother’s purification
was already past, and the solemnities proper to the first-born were
performed with respect to the child in the temple, nay more, only after
their departure into Egypt, did it come into his mind to seek the life
of the child, and to slay so many little ones;—if, I say, any one finds
a difficulty in this, I shall not pause to state the numerous and
important occupations by which the king’s attention may have been
engaged, and for the space of many days either wholly diverted from such
thoughts, or prevented from following them out. For it is not possible
to enumerate all the cases which might have made that perfectly
possible. No one, however, is so ignorant of human affairs as either to
deny or to question that there may very easily have been many such
matters of importance (to preoccupy the king). For to whom will not the
thought occur, that reports, whether true or false, of many other more
terrible things may possibly have been brought to the king, so that the
person who had been apprehensive of a certain royal child, who after a
number of years might prove an adversary to himself or to his sons,
might be so agitated with the terrors of certain more immediate dangers,
as to have his attention forcibly removed from that earlier <span
id="page_116">p. 116</span> <span id="vi.v.xii-Page_116"></span>anxiety,
and engaged rather with the devising of measures to ward off other more
instantly threatening perils? Wherefore, leaving all such considerations
unspecified, I simply venture on the assertion that, when the wise men
failed to bring back any report to him, Herod may have believed that
they had been misled by a deceptive vision of a star, and that, after
their want of success in discovering Him whom they had supposed to have
been born, they had been ashamed to return to him; and that in this way
the king, having his fears allayed, had given up the idea of asking
after and persecuting the child. Consequently, when they had gone with
Him to Jerusalem after the purification of His mother, and when those
things had been performed in the temple which are recounted by
Luke, <span id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md) inasmuch as the words
which were spoken by Simeon and Anna in their prophesyings regarding
Him, when publicity began to be given to them by the persons who had
heard them, were like to call back the king’s mind then to its original
design, Joseph obeyed the warning conveyed to him in the dream, and fled
with the child and His mother into Egypt. Afterwards, when the things
which had been done and said in the temple were made quite public, Herod
perceived that he had been mocked; and then, in his desire to get at the
death of Christ, he slew the multitude of children, as Matthew
records. <span id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md)
