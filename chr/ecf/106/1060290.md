<span id="vii.lxxiii-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.lxxiii-p1.1"></span>Sermon LXXI.</span>

<span id="vii.lxxiii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.lxxiii-p2.1"></span>\[CXXI. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.lxxiii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.lxxiii-p3.1"></span>*[John i.
10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010.md)<span id="vii.lxxiii-p3.2"></span>,
“The world was made through him,” etc.*

<span id="vii.lxxiii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.lxxiii-p4.1"></span>By</span> the Lord “was the world made, and
the world knew Him not.” <span id="fr_3620"></span>[3621](#fn_3620.md) What
world was made by Him, what world knew Him not? For it is not the same
world that was made by Him, which knew Him not. What is the world that
was made by Him? The heaven and earth. How did not the heaven know Him,
when at His Passion the sun was darkened? How did not the earth know
Him, when as He hung upon the Cross, it quaked? But “the world knew Him
not,” whose Prince he is, of whom it is said, “Behold, the prince of
this world cometh, and findeth nothing in me.”  <span
id="fr_3621"></span>[3622](#fn_3621.md) Wicked men are called the world;
unbelieving men are called the world. They have gotten their name from
that they love. By the love of God we are made gods; so by the love of
the world, we are called the world. But “God was in Christ reconciling
the world unto Himself.” <span id="fr_3622"></span>[3623](#fn_3622.md) “The
world” then “knew Him not.” What? “all men?”

<span id="vii.lxxiii-p8"></span>2. “He came unto His Own, and His Own
received Him not.” <span id="fr_3623"></span>[3624](#fn_3623.md) All things
are His, but they are called His Own, from among whom His mother was,
among whom He had taken Flesh, to whom He had sent before the heralds of
His advent, to whom He had given the law, whom He had delivered from the
Egyptian bondage, whose father Abraham according to the flesh He
elected. For He said truth, “Before Abraham was, I am.” <span
id="fr_3624"></span>[3625](#fn_3624.md) He did not say, “Before Abraham
was,” or “before Abraham was made, I was made.” For “in the beginning
the Word was,” not, “was made.” So then “He came unto His Own,” He came
to the Jews. “And His Own received Him not.”

<span id="vii.lxxiii-p11"></span>3. “But as many as received Him.” <span
id="fr_3625"></span>[3626](#fn_3625.md) For of course the Apostles were
there, who “received Him.” There were they who carried branches before
His beast. They went before and followed after, and spread their
garments, and cried with a loud voice, “Hosanna to the Son of David,
Blessed is He That cometh in the Name of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3626"></span>[3627](#fn_3626.md) Then said the Pharisees unto Him,
“Restrain the children, that they cry not out so unto Thee.” And He
said, “If these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.” <span
id="fr_3627"></span>[3628](#fn_3627.md) Us He saw when He spake these
words; “If these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.” Who
are stones, but they who worship stones? If the Jewish children shall
hold their peace, the elder and the younger Gentiles shall cry out. Who
are the stones, but they of whom speaketh that very John, who came “to
bear witness of the Light”? <span id="fr_3628"></span>[3629](#fn_3628.md)
For when he saw these self-same Jews priding themselves on their birth
from Abraham, he said to them, “O generation of vipers.” <span
id="fr_3629"></span>[3630](#fn_3629.md) They called themselves the children
of Abraham; and he addressed them, “O generation of vipers.” Did he do
Abraham wrong? God forbid! He gave them a name from their character. For
that if they were the children of Abraham, they would imitate Abraham;
as He too telleth them who say to Him, “We be free, and were never in
bondage to any man; we have Abraham for our father.” And He said, “If ye
were Abraham’s children, ye would do the deeds of Abraham. Ye wish to
kill Me, because I tell you the truth. This did not Abraham.” <span
id="fr_3630"></span>[3631](#fn_3630.md) Ye were of his stock, but ye are a
degenerate stock. So then what said John? “O generation of vipers, who
hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?” Because they came to be
baptized with the baptism of John unto repentance. “Who hath warned you
to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of
repentance. And say not in your hearts, We have Abraham to our father.
For God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.”
 <span id="fr_3631"></span>[3632](#fn_3631.md) For God is able of these
stones which he saw in the Spirit; to them he spake; he foresaw us; “For
God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.” Of what
stones? “If these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.” Ye
have just now heard, and cried out. It is fulfilled, “The stones shall
cry out.” For from among the Gentiles we came, in our forefathers we
worshipped stones. Therefore are we called dogs too. Call to mind what
that woman heard who cried out after the Lord, for she was a Canaanitish
woman, a worshipper of idols, the handmaid of devils. What said Jesus to
her? “It is not good to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to
dogs.” <span id="fr_3632"></span>[3633](#fn_3632.md) Have ye never noticed,
how dogs will lick the greasy stones? So are all the worshippers of
images. But grace has come to you. “But as many as received Him, to them
gave He power to become the sons of God.” See ye have here some just now
born: to them hath He “given power to become the sons of God.” To whom
hath He given it? “To them that believe in His Name.”

<span id="vii.lxxiii-p20"></span>4. And how do they become the sons of
God? <span id="page_470">p. 470</span> <span
id="vii.lxxiii-Page_470"></span>“Who were born, not of blood, nor of the
will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God.” <span
id="fr_3633"></span>[3634](#fn_3633.md) Having received power to become the
sons of God, they are born of God. Mark then: They are born of God, “not
of blood,” like their first birth, like that wretched birth, issuing out
of wretchedness. But they who are born of God, what were they? whereby
were they first born? Of blood; of the joint blood of the male and
female, of the carnal union of male and female, from this were they
born. From whence now? They are born of God. The first birth of the male
and female; the second birth of God and the Church.

<span id="vii.lxxiii-p22"></span>5. Lo, they are born of God; whereby is
it brought to pass that they should be born of God, who were first born
of men? Whereby is it brought to pass, whereby? “And the Word was made
Flesh, that It might dwell among us.” <span
id="fr_3634"></span>[3635](#fn_3634.md) Wondrous exchange; He made Flesh,
they spirit. What is this? What condescension is here, my brethren! Lift
up your minds to the hope and comprehension of better things. Give not
yourselves up to worldly desires. “Ye have been bought with a
Price;” <span id="fr_3635"></span>[3636](#fn_3635.md) for your sakes the
Word was made Flesh; for your sakes He who was the Son of God, was made
the Son of man: that ye who were the sons of men, might be made sons of
God. What was He, what was He made? What were ye, what were ye made? He
was the Son of God. What was He made? The Son of man. Ye were the sons
of men. What were ye made? The sons of God. He shared with us our evil
things, to give us His good things. But even in that He was made the Son
of man, He is different much from us. We are the sons of men by the lust
of the flesh; He the Son of man by the faith of a virgin. The mother of
any other man whatever conceives by a carnal union; and every one is
born of human parents, his father and his mother. But Christ was born of
the Holy Ghost, and the Virgin Mary. He came to us, but from Himself
departed not far; yea from Himself as God He departed never; but added
what He was to our nature. For He came to that which He was not, He did
not lose what He was. He was made the Son of man; but did not cease to
be the Son of God. Hereby the Mediator, in the middle. What is, “in the
middle”? Neither up above, nor down below. How neither up above, nor
down below? Not above, since He is Flesh; not below, since He is not a
sinner. But yet in so far as He is God, above always. For He did not so
come to us, as to leave the Father. From us He went, and did not leave
us; to us will He come again, and will not leave Him.
