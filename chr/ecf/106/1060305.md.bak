<span id="vii.lxxxviii-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.lxxxviii-p1.1"></span>Sermon LXXXVI.</span>

<span id="vii.lxxxviii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.lxxxviii-p2.1"></span>\[CXXXVI. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.lxxxviii-p3"></span>*On the same lesson of the Gospel,*
<span id="vii.lxxxviii-p3.1"></span>*John ix., on the giving sight to
the man that was born blind.*

<span id="vii.lxxxviii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.lxxxviii-p4.1"></span>We</span> have heard the lesson of the
Holy Gospel which we are in the habit of hearing; but it is a good thing
to be reminded: good to refresh the memory from the lethargy of
forgetfulness. And in fact this very old lesson has <span
id="page_515">p. 515</span> <span
id="vii.lxxxviii-Page_515"></span>given us as much pleasure as if it
were new. Christ gave sight to one blind from his birth; why do we
marvel? Christ is the Saviour; by an act of mercy He made up that which
He had not given in the womb. Now when He gave that man no eyes, it was
no mistake of His surely; but a delay with a view to a miracle. You are
saying, it may be, “Whence knowest thou this?” From Himself I have heard
it; He just now said it; we heard it all together. For when His
disciples asked Him, and said, “Lord, who did sin, this man or his
parents, that he was born blind?” <span
id="fr_4046"></span>[4047](#fn_4046.md) What answer He made, ye, as I did,
heard. “Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents, but that the
works of God should be made manifest in him.” <span
id="fr_4047"></span>[4048](#fn_4047.md) Lo then wherefore it was that He
delayed when He gave him no eyes. He did not give what He could give, He
did not give what He knew He should give, when need was. Yet do not
suppose, Brethren, that this man’s parents had no sin, or that he
himself had not, when he was born, contracted original sin, for the
remission of which sin infants are baptized unto remission of sins. But
that blindness was not because of his parents’ sin, nor because of his
own sin; “but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.” For
we all when we were born contracted original sin: and yet we were not
born blind. However enquire carefully, And we were born blind. For who
was not born blind? blind, that is, in heart. But the Lord Jesus, for
that He had created both, cured both.

<span id="vii.lxxxviii-p7"></span>2. With the eyes of faith ye have seen
this man blind, ye have seen him too of blind seeing; but ye have heard
him erring. Wherein this blind man erred, I will tell you; first, in
that he thought Christ a prophet, and knew not that He was the Son of
God. And then we have heard an answer of his entirely false; for he
said, “We know that God heareth not sinners.” <span
id="fr_4048"></span>[4049](#fn_4048.md) If God heareth not sinners, what
hope have we? If God heareth not sinners, why do we pray, and publish
the record of our sin by the beating of the breast? Where again is that
Publican, who went up with the Pharisee into the temple <span
id="fr_4049"></span>[4050](#fn_4049.md) and while the Pharisee was
boasting, parading <span id="fr_4050"></span>[4051](#fn_4050.md) his own
merits, he standing afar off, and with his eyes fastened on the ground,
and beating his breast, was confessing his sins? And this man, who
confessed his sins, went down from the temple justified rather than the
other Pharisee. Assuredly then God doth hear sinners. But he who spake
these words had not yet washed the face of the heart in Siloa. The
sacrament had gone before on his eyes; but in the heart had not been yet
effected the blessing of the grace. When did this blind man wash the
face of his heart? When the Lord admitted him into Himself after he had
been cast out by the Jews. For He found him, and said to him as we have
heard; “Dost thou believe on the Son of God?” And he, “Who is He, Lord,
that I may believe on Him?” <span id="fr_4051"></span>[4052](#fn_4051.md)
With the eyes, it is true, he saw already; did he see already in the
heart? No, not yet. Wait; he will see presently. Jesus answered him, “I
that speak with thee am He.” <span id="fr_4052"></span>[4053](#fn_4052.md)
Did he doubt? No, forthwith he washed his face. For he was speaking with
That Siloa, “which is by interpretation, Sent.” <span
id="fr_4053"></span>[4054](#fn_4053.md) Who is the Sent, but Christ? Who
often bare witness, saying, “I do the will of My Father That sent
Me.” <span id="fr_4054"></span>[4055](#fn_4054.md) He then was Himself the
Siloa. The man approached blind in heart, he heard, believed, adored;
washed the face, saw.

<span id="vii.lxxxviii-p15"></span>3. But they who cast him out
continued blind, forasmuch as they cavilled at the Lord, that it was the
sabbath when He made clay of the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the
blind man. For when the Lord cured with a word, the Jews openly
cavilled. For He did no work on the sabbath day, when He spake, and it
was done. It was a manifest cavil; they cavilled at Him merely
commanding, they cavilled at Him speaking; as if they did not themselves
speak all the sabbath day. I might say that they do not speak not only
on the sabbath, but on no day, forasmuch as they have kept back from the
praises of the True God. Nevertheless, as I have said, brethren, it was
a manifest cavil. The Lord said to a certain man, “Stretch forth thine
hand;” <span id="fr_4055"></span>[4056](#fn_4055.md) he was made whole, and
they cavilled for that He healed on the sabbath day. What did He do?
what work did He do? what burden did He bear? But in this instance, the
spitting on the ground, the making clay, and anointing the man’s eyes,
is doing some work. Let no one doubt it, it was doing a work. The Lord
did break the sabbath; but was not therefore guilty. What is that I have
said, “He brake the sabbath”? He, the Light had come, He was removing
the shadows. For the sabbath was enjoined by the Lord God, enjoined by
Christ Himself, who was with the Father, when that Law was given; it was
enjoined by Him, but in shadow of what was to come. “Let no man
therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day,
or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days, which are a shadow of things
to come.” <span id="fr_4056"></span>[4057](#fn_4056.md) He had now come
whose coming these things announced. Why do the shadows delight us? Open
your eyes, ye Jews; the Sun is present. “We know.” <span
id="fr_4057"></span>[4058](#fn_4057.md) What do <span id="page_516">p.
516</span> <span id="vii.lxxxviii-Page_516"></span>ye know, ye blind in
heart? what know ye? “That this man is not of God, because he thus
breaketh the sabbath day.” <span id="fr_4058"></span>[4059](#fn_4058.md)
The sabbath, unhappy men, this very sabbath did Christ ordain, <span
id="fr_4059"></span>[4060](#fn_4059.md) who ye say is not of God. Ye
observe the sabbath in a carnal manner, ye have not the spittle of
Christ. In this earth of the sabbath look also for the spittle of
Christ, and ye will understand that by the sabbath Christ was
prophesied. But ye, because ye have not the spittle of Christ in the
earth upon your eyes, ye have not come unto Siloa, and have not washed
the face, and have continued blind, blind to the good of this blind man,
yea now no longer blind either in body or heart. He received clay with
the spittle, his eyes were anointed, he came to Siloa, he washed his
face, he believed on Christ, he saw, he continued not in that
exceedingly fearful judgment; “For judgment I came into this world, that
they which see not may see, and that they which see may be made
blind.” <span id="fr_4060"></span>[4061](#fn_4060.md)

<span id="vii.lxxxviii-p22"></span>4. Exceeding alarm! “That they which
see not may see:” Good. It is a Saviour’s office, a profession of
healing power, “That they which see not may see.” But what, Lord, is
that Thou hast added, “That they which see may be made blind”? If we
understand, it is most true, most righteous. Yet what is, “They which
see”? They are the Jews. Do they then see? According to their own words,
they see; according to the truth, they do not see. What then is, “they
see”? They think they see, they believe they see. For they believed they
did see, when they maintained the Law against Christ. “We know;”
therefore they see. What is “We know,” but we see? What is, “this Man is
not of God, because He thus breaketh the sabbath day”? They see; they
read what the Law said. For it was enjoined that whosoever should break
the sabbath day, should be stoned. <span
id="fr_4061"></span>[4062](#fn_4061.md) Therefore said they that He was not
of God; but though seeing, they were blind to this, that for judgment He
came into the world who is to be the Judge of quick and dead; why came
He? “That they which see not may see:” that they who confess that they
do not see, may be enlightened. “And that they which see may be made
blind;” that is, that they who confess not their own blindness, may be
the more hardened. And, in fact, “That they which see may be made
blind,” has been fulfilled; the defenders of the Law, Doctors <span
id="fr_4062"></span>[4063](#fn_4062.md) of the Law, the teachers of the
Law, the understanders of the Law, crucified the Author of the Law. O
blindness, this is that which “in part hath happened to Israel.” <span
id="fr_4063"></span>[4064](#fn_4063.md) That Christ might be crucified, and
the fulness of the Gentiles might come in, “blindness in part hath
happened to Israel.” What is, “that they which see not may see”? That
the fulness of the Gentiles might come in, “blindness in part hath
happened to Israel.” The whole world lay in blindness; but He came,
“that they which see not may see, and that they which see may be made
blind.” He was disowned by the Jews, He was crucified by the Jews; of
His Blood He made an eye-salve for the blind. They who boasted that they
saw the light, being more hardened, being made blind, crucified the
Light. What great blindness? They killed the Light, but the Light
Crucified enlightened the blind.

<span id="vii.lxxxviii-p26"></span>5. Hear one seeing, who once was
blind. Behold, against what a cross they have miserably stumbled, who
would not confess their blindness to the Physician! The Law had
continued with them. What serveth the Law without grace? Unhappy men,
what can the Law do without grace? What doeth the earth without the
spittle of Christ? What doeth the Law without grace, but make them more
guilty? Why? Because hearers of the Law and not doers, and hereby
sinners, transgressors. The son of the hostess of the man of God was
dead, and his staff was sent by his servant, and laid upon his
face, <span id="fr_4064"></span>[4065](#fn_4064.md) but he did not revive.
What doeth the Law without grace? What saith the Apostle, now seeing,
now of blind, enlightened? “For if there had been a Law given which
could give life, verily righteousness should have been by the
Law.” <span id="fr_4065"></span>[4066](#fn_4065.md) Take heed; let us
answer and say; what is this that he hath said? “If there had been a Law
given which could give life, verily righteousness should have been by
the Law.” If it could not give life, why was it given? He went on and
added, “But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise
by the faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.” <span
id="fr_4066"></span>[4067](#fn_4066.md) That the promise of illumination,
the promise of love by the faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them
that believe, that Scripture, that is the Law, hath concluded all under
sin. What is, “hath concluded all under sin”? “I had not known
concupiscence, except the Law had said, Thou shalt not lust.” <span
id="fr_4067"></span>[4068](#fn_4067.md) What is, “hath concluded all under
sin”? Hath made the sinner a transgressor also. For it could not heal
the sinner. “It hath concluded all under sin;” but with what hope? The
hope of grace, the hope of mercy. Thou hast received the Law: thou didst
wish to keep it, thou wast not able; thou hast fallen from pride, hast
seen thy weakness. Run to the Physician, wash the face. Long for Christ,
confess Christ, believe on Christ; the Spirit is added to the letter,
and thou wilt be saved. For if thou take away the Spirit from the
letter, “the letter killeth;” if <span id="page_517">p. 517</span> <span
id="vii.lxxxviii-Page_517"></span>it kill, where is hope? “But the
Spirit giveth life.” <span id="fr_4068"></span>[4069](#fn_4068.md)

<span id="vii.lxxxviii-p32"></span>6. Let then Gehazi, Elisha’s servant,
receive the staff, as Moses the servant of God received the Law. Let him
receive the staff, receive it, run, go before, anticipate him, lay the
staff upon the face of the dead child. And so it was; he did receive it,
he ran, he laid the staff upon the face of the dead child. But to what
purpose? what serveth the staff? “If there had been a Law given which
could give life,” the boy might have been raised to life by the staff;
but seeing that “the Scripture hath concluded all under sin,” he still
lies dead. But why hath it concluded all under sin? “That the promise by
the faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.” Let then
Elisha come, who sent the staff by the servant to prove that he was
dead; let him come himself, come in his own person, himself enter into
the woman’s house, go up to the child, find him dead, conform himself to
the members of the dead child, himself not dead, but living. For this he
did; he laid his face upon his face, his eyes upon his eyes, his hands
upon his hands, his feet upon his feet, he straitened, he contracted
himself, being great, he made himself little. He contracted himself; so
to say, he lessened himself. “For being in the Form of God, He emptied
Himself, taking the form of a servant.” <span
id="fr_4069"></span>[4070](#fn_4069.md) What is He conformed Himself, alive
to the dead? Do ye ask, what this is? Hear the Apostle; “God sent His
Son.” <span id="fr_4070"></span>[4071](#fn_4070.md) What is, he conformed
himself to the dead? Let him tell this, let him go on and declare it
again; “In the likeness of flesh of sin.” This is to conform Himself
Alive to the dead; to come to us in the likeness of flesh of sin, not in
the flesh of sin. Man lay dead in a flesh of sin, the likeness of flesh
of sin conformed Himself to him. For He died who had not wherefore to
die. He died, Alone “Free among the dead;” forasmuch as the whole flesh
of men was indeed a flesh of sin. And how should it rise again, had not
He who had no sin, conforming Himself to the dead, come in the likeness
of flesh of sin? O Lord Jesus, who hast suffered for us, not for
Thyself, who hadst no guilt, and didst endure its punishment, that thou
mightest dissolve at once the guilt and punishment.
