<span id="vi.v.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Of the Words or the Voice that
Came from Heaven Upon Him When He Had Been Baptized.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xv-p2"></span>31. Thereafter Matthew proceeds thus: “And
Jesus, when He was baptized, went up straightway out of the water; and,
lo, the heavens were opened unto Him, and He saw the Spirit of God
descending like a dove, and lighting upon Him; and, lo, a voice from
heaven saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” This
incident is also recorded in a similar manner by two of the others,
namely Mark and Luke. But at the same time, while preserving the sense
intact, they use different modes of expression in reproducing the terms
of the voice which came from heaven. For although Matthew tells us that
the words were, “This is my beloved Son,” while the other two put them
in this form, “Thou art my beloved Son,” these different methods of
speech serve but to convey the same sense, according to the principle
which has been discussed above. For the heavenly voice gave utterance
only to one of these sentences; but by the form of words thus adopted,
namely, “This is my beloved Son,” it was the evangelist’s intention to
show that the saying was meant to intimate specially to the hearers
there \[and not to Jesus\] the fact that He was the Son of God. With
this view, he chose to give the sentence, “Thou art my beloved Son,”
this turn, “This is my beloved Son,” as if it were addressed directly to
the people. For it was not meant to intimate to Christ a fact which He
knew already; but the object was to let the people who were present hear
it, for whose sakes indeed the voice itself was given. But furthermore
now, with regard to the circumstance that the first of them puts the
saying thus, “In whom I am well pleased,” <span
id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803.md) the second thus, “In Thee I am well
pleased;” <span id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804.md) and the third thus,
“In Thee it has pleased me;” <span id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805.md) —if
you ask which of these different modes represents what was actually
expressed by the voice, you may fix on whichever you will, provided only
that you understand that those of the writers who have not reproduced
the self-same form of speech have still reproduced the identical sense
intended to be conveyed. And these variations in the modes of expression
are also useful in this way, that they make it possible for us to <span
id="page_120">p. 120</span> <span id="vi.v.xv-Page_120"></span>reach a
more adequate conception of the saying than might have been the case
with only one form, and that they also secure it against being
interpreted in a sense not consonant with the real state of the case.
For as to the sentence, “In whom I am well pleased,” <span
id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806.md) if any one thinks of taking it as if
it meant that God is pleased with Himself in the Son, he is taught a
lesson of prudence by the other turn which is given to the saying, “In
Thee I am well pleased.” <span id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807.md) And on
the other hand, if, looking at this last by itself, any one supposes the
meaning to be, that in the Son the Father had favour with men, he learns
something from the third form of the utterance, “In Thee it has pleased
me.” <span id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808.md) From this it becomes
sufficiently apparent, that whichever of the evangelists may have
preserved for us the words as they were literally uttered by the
heavenly voice, the others have varied the terms only with the object of
setting forth the same sense more familiarly; so that what is thus given
by all of them might be understood as if the expression were: In Thee I
have set my good pleasure; that is to say, by Thee to do what is my
pleasure. <span id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809.md) But once more, with
respect to that rendering which is contained in some codices of the
Gospel according to Luke, and which bears that the words heard in the
heavenly voice were those that are written in the Psalm, “Thou art my
Son, this day have I begotten Thee;” <span
id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810.md) although it is said not to be found in
the more ancient Greek codices, yet if it can be established by any
copies worthy of credit, what results but that we suppose both voices to
have been heard from heaven, in one or other verbal order?
