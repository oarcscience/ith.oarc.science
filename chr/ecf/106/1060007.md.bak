<span id="v.ii.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.</span>

<span id="v.ii.i-p2"></span>1. If any one will piously and soberly
consider the sermon which our Lord Jesus Christ spoke on the mount, as
we read it in the Gospel according to Matthew, I think that he will find
in it, so far as regards the highest morals, a perfect standard of the
Christian life: and this we do not rashly venture to promise, but gather
it from the very words of the Lord Himself. For the sermon itself is
brought to a close in such a way, that it is clear there are in it all
the precepts which go to mould the life. For thus He speaks: “Therefore,
whosoever heareth these words of mine, and doeth them, I will
liken <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) him unto a wise man, which built
his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and
the winds blew, and beat <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) upon that
house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one
that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them not, I will liken <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) unto a foolish man, which built his house
upon the sand: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the
winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the
fall of it.” Since, therefore, He has not simply said, “Whosoever
heareth my words,” but has made an addition, saying, “Whosoever heareth
these words of mine,” He has sufficiently indicated, as I think, that
these sayings which He uttered on the mount so perfectly guide the life
of those who may be willing to live according to them, that they may
justly be compared to one building upon a rock. I have said this merely
that it may be clear that the sermon before us is perfect in all the
precepts by which the Christian life is moulded; for as regards this
particular section a more careful treatment will be given in its own
place. <span id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md)

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span> <span id="v.ii.i-Page_4"></span>

<span id="v.ii.i-p9"></span>2. The beginning, then, of this sermon is
introduced as follows: “And when He saw the great <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) multitudes, He went up into a
mountain: <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) and when He was set, His
disciples came unto Him: and He opened His mouth, and taught them,
saying.” If it is asked what the “mountain” means, it may well be
understood as meaning the greater precepts of righteousness; for there
were lesser ones which were given to the Jews. Yet it is one God who,
through His holy prophets and servants, according to a thoroughly
arranged distribution of times, gave the lesser precepts to a people who
as yet required to be bound by fear; and who, through His Son, gave the
greater ones to a people whom it had now become suitable to set free by
love. Moreover, when the lesser are given to the lesser, and the greater
to the greater, they are given by Him who alone knows how to present to
the human race the medicine suited to the occasion. Nor is it surprising
that the greater precepts are given for the kingdom of heaven, and the
lesser for an earthly kingdom, by that one and the same God, who made
heaven and earth. With respect, therefore, to that righteousness which
is the greater, it is said through the prophet, “Thy righteousness is
like the mountains of God:” <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) and this
may well mean that the one Master alone fit to teach matters of so great
importance teaches on a mountain. Then He teaches sitting, as behooves
the dignity of the instructor’s office; and His disciples come to Him,
in order that they might be nearer in body for hearing His words, as
they also approached in spirit to fulfil His precepts. “And He opened
His mouth, and taught them, saying.” The circumlocution before us, which
runs, “And He opened His mouth,” perhaps gracefully intimates by the
mere pause that the sermon will be somewhat longer than usual, unless,
perchance, it should not be without meaning, that now He is said to have
opened His own mouth, whereas under the old law He was accustomed to
open the mouths of the prophets. <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md)

<span id="v.ii.i-p14"></span>3. What, then, does He say? “Blessed are
the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” We read in
Scripture concerning the striving after temporal things, “All is vanity
and presumption of spirit;” <span id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) but
presumption of spirit means audacity and pride: usually also the proud
are said to have great spirits; and rightly, inasmuch as the wind also
is called spirit. And hence it is written, “Fire, hail, snow, ice,
spirit of tempest.” <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) But, indeed,
who does not know that the proud are spoken of as puffed up, as if
swelled out with wind? And hence also that expression of the apostle,
“Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.” <span
id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) And “the poor in spirit” are rightly
understood here, as meaning the humble and God-fearing, *i.e.* those who
have not the spirit which puffeth up. Nor ought blessedness to begin at
any other point whatever, if indeed it is to attain unto the highest
wisdom; “but the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;” <span
id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) for, on the other hand also, “pride” is
entitled “the beginning of all sin.” <span
id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md) Let the proud, therefore, seek after and
love the kingdoms of the earth; but “blessed are the poor in spirit, for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md)

<span id="v.ii.i-p6"></span> The main purpose of the Sermon on the Mount
has been variously stated. Augustin regards it as a perfect code of
morals. Tholuck <span id="v.ii.i-p6.1"></span>(*Die Bergpredigt*) calls
it “the Magna Charta of the kingdom of heaven.” Lange says, “The grand
fundamental idea is to present the righteousness of the kingdom of
heaven in its relation to that of the Old Testament theocracy.” Geikie
declares it to be the “formal inauguration of the kingdom of God and the
Magna Charta of our faith.” Edersheim regards it as presenting “the full
delineation of the ideal man of God, of prayer, and of righteousness; in
short, of the inward and outward manifestation of discipleship.” Meyer
(*Com.* 6th ed. p. 210) says that the aim of Jesus is, as the One who
fulfils the Law and the Prophets, to present the moral conditions of
participation in the Messianic kingdom. Weiss *(Leben Jesu)* speaks of
it as being “as little an ethical discourse as a new proclamation of
law. It is nothing else than an announcement of the kingdom of God, in
which is visible everywhere the purpose of Jesus to distinguish between
its righteousness and the righteousness revealed in the Old Testament as
well as that taught by the teachers of his day.”

<span id="v.ii.i-p7"></span>The Sermon on the Mount is a practical
discourse, containing little of what, in the strict sense, may be termed
the *credenda* of Christianity. It is the fullest statement of the
nature and obligations of citizenship in God’s kingdom. It is noteworthy
for its omissions as well as for its contents. No reference is made to a
priesthood, a ritual, sacred places, or offerings. There is almost a
total absence of all that is sensuous and external. It deals with the
motives and affections of the inner man, and so comes into comparison
and contrast with the Mosaic law as well as with the Pharisaic
ceremonialism of the Lord’s Day. The moral grandeur of the precepts of
the Sermon on the Mount has been acknowledged by believer and sceptics
alike. Renan *(Life of Jesus)* says, “The Sermon on the Mount will never
be surpassed.” On the 15th of October, 1852, two weeks before he died,
Daniel Webster wrote and signed his name to the following words,
containing a testimony to this portion of Scripture, which he also
ordered placed upon his tombstone: “Lord, I believe; help thou mine
unbelief.…My heart has assured me and reassured me that the gospel of
Jesus Christ must be a divine reality. The Sermon on the Mount cannot be
a merely human production. This belief enters into the very depth of my
conscience. The whole history of man proves it” (Curtis, *Life of
Webster*, ii. p. 684).

<span id="v.ii.i-p8"></span>The relation which the reports of Matthew
and Luke (vi. 20–49) sustain to each other is ignored by Augustin here
(who, except in rare cases, omits all critical discussion), but is
discussed in his *Harmony of the Gospels*, ii. 19. The agreements are
numerous. The differences are striking, and concern the matter, the
arrangement, the language, and the setting of the sermon. Matthew has a
hundred and seven verses, Luke thirty. Matthew has seven (or eight)
beatitudes, Luke but four, and adds four woes which Matthew omits.
According to the first evangelist Jesus spoke sitting on a mountain:
according to the third evangelist He spoke standing, and in the plain.
The views are, (1) Matthew and Luke give accounts of the same discourse
(Origen, Chrysostom, Calvin, Tholuck, Meyer, Keil, Schaff, Weiss). (2)
They report different sermons spoken at different times (Augustin not
positively, Storr, Plumptre). This is not probable, as so much of the
matter in both is identical: both begin with the same beatitude, and
close with the same parable; and both accounts are followed with the
report of the healing of the centurion’s servant. (3) The two sermons
were delivered in close succession on the summit of the mountain to the
disciples, and on the plain to the multitude (Lange). Alford confesses
inability to reconcile the discrepancy.

<span id="v.ii.i-p11"></span> The Greek has the definite article <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.i-p11.1"></span> τὸ ὄρος</span>. Some, on
this ground, explain the expression to mean “mountain region.” According
to the Latin tradition of the time of the Crusaders, the exact spot is
the Horns of Hattin, which Dean Stanley (*Sinai and Palestine*, Am. ed.
p. 436) and most others adopt. The hill, which is horned like a saddle,
is south-west of Capernaum, and commands a good view of the Lake of
Galilee. It seems to meet the requirements of the text. Robinson says
there are a dozen other hills as eligible as this one. Tholuck enlarges
upon the “beautiful temple of nature in which the Lord delivered the
sermon.” Matthew Henry says, “When the law was given, the Lord came down
upon the mountain, now the Lord went up; then He spake in thunder and
lightning, now in a still, small voice; then the people were ordered to
keep their distance, now they are invited to draw near,—a blessed
change!”

<span id="v.ii.i-p13"></span> Chrysostom, Euthymius, etc., see in the
expression the implication that Christ also taught by works. Tholuck,
with many modern commentators, finds in it a reference to “loud and
solemn utterance.”

Roman-Catholic commentators have found here support for the doctrine of
voluntary poverty (Cornelius à Lapide, Maldonatus, etc.). The Emperor
Julian, in allusion to this passage and others like it, said he would
only confiscate the goods of Christians, that they might enter as *the
poor* into the kingdom of heaven (*Lett*. xliii.). Some (Olearius,
Michaelis, Paulus) have joined “in spirit” with “blessed.” Augustin
explains the passage of those who are not elated or proud, taking
“spirit” in an evil sense. In another place he says, “Blessed are the
poor in their own spirit, rich in God’s Spirit, for every man who
follows his own spirit is proud.” He then compares him who subdues his
own spirit to one living in a valley which is filled with water from the
hills (*En. in Ps*. cxli. 4). The most explain of those who are
conscious of spiritual need ([Matt. xi.
28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028)<span id="v.ii.i-p20.2"></span>.md),
and are ready to be filled with the gospel riches, as opposed to the
spiritually proud, the just who need no repentance (Tholuck, Meyer,
Lange, etc.). “Many are poor in the world, but high in spirit; poor and
proud, murmuring and complaining, and blaming their lot. Laodicea was
poor in spirituals, and yet rich in spirit; so well increased with goods
as to have need of nothing. Paul was rich in spirituals, excelling most
in gifts and graces and yet poor in spirit; the least of the apostles,
and less than the least of all saints” (M. Henry).
