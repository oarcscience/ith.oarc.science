<span id="vii.xlix-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.xlix-p1.1"></span>Sermon XLVII.</span>

<span id="vii.xlix-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.xlix-p2.1"></span>\[XCVII. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.xlix-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xlix-p3.1"></span>*[Mark xiii.
32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032.md)<span id="vii.xlix-p3.2"></span>,
“But of that day or that hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in
heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.”*

<span id="vii.xlix-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xlix-p4.1"></span>The</span> advice, Brethren, which ye have
just heard Scripture give, when it tells us to watch for the last day,
every one should think of as concerning his own last day; lest haply
when ye judge or think the last day of the world to be far distant, ye
slumber with respect to your own last day. Ye have heard what Jesus said
concerning the last day of this world, “That neither the Angels of
heaven, nor the Son knew it, but the Father.”  <span
id="fr_3175"></span>[3176](#fn_3175.md) Where indeed there is a great
difficulty, lest understanding this in a carnal way, we think that the
Father knoweth anything which the Son knoweth not. For indeed when He
said, “the Father knoweth it;” He said this because in the Father the
Son also knoweth it. For what is there in a day which was not made by
the Word, by whom the day was made? Let no one then search out for the
last Day, when it is to be; but let us watch all by our good lives, lest
the last day of any one of us find us unprepared, and such as any one
shall depart hence on his last day, such he be found in the last day of
the world. Nothing will then assist thee which thou shalt not have done
here. His own works will succour, or his own works will overwhelm every
one.

<span id="vii.xlix-p6"></span>2. And how have we in the Psalm sung unto
the Lord, “Lord, have mercy on me, for man hath trodden me down”? <span
id="fr_3176"></span>[3177](#fn_3176.md) He is called a man who lives after
the manner of men. For it is said to them who live after God, “Ye are
gods, and ye are all the children of the Most High.” <span
id="fr_3177"></span>[3178](#fn_3177.md) But to the reprobate, who were
called to be the sons of God, and who wished rather to be men, that is,
to live after the manner of men, he says, “But ye shall die like men,
and fall as one of <span id="page_412">p. 412</span> <span
id="vii.xlix-Page_412"></span>the princes.” <span
id="fr_3178"></span>[3179](#fn_3178.md) For that man is mortal, ought to
avail for his instruction, not for boasting. Whereupon does a worm that
is to die on the morrow boast himself? I speak to your love, Brethren;
proud mortals ought to be made blush by the devil. For he, though proud,
is yet immortal; he is a spirit, though a malignant one. The last day is
kept in store for him at the end as his punishment; nevertheless he is
not subject to the death to which we are subject. But man heard the
sentence, “Thou shalt surely die.” <span
id="fr_3179"></span>[3180](#fn_3179.md) Let him make a good use of his
punishment. What is that I have said, “Let him make a good use of his
punishment”? Let him not by that from which he received his punishment
fall into pride; let him acknowledge that he is mortal, and let it break
down his elation. Let him hear it said to him, “Why is earth and ashes
proud?” <span id="fr_3180"></span>[3181](#fn_3180.md) Even if the devil is
proud, he is not “earth and ashes.” Therefore was it said, “But ye shall
die like men, and shall fall as one of the princes.” <span
id="fr_3181"></span>[3182](#fn_3181.md) Ye do not consider that ye are
mortals, and ye are proud as the devil. Let man then make a good use of
his punishment, Brethren; let him make a good use of his evil, that he
may make advancement to his good. Who does not know, that the necessity
of our dying is a punishment; and the more grievous, that we know not
when? The punishment is certain, the hour uncertain; and of that
punishment alone are we certain in the ordinary course of human affairs.

<span id="vii.xlix-p13"></span>3. All else of ours, both good and evil,
is uncertain; death alone is certain. What is this that I say? A child
is conceived, perhaps it will be born, perhaps it will be an untimely
birth. So it is uncertain: Perhaps he will grow up, perhaps he will not
grow up; perhaps he will grow old, perhaps he will not grow old; perhaps
he will be rich, perhaps poor; perhaps he will be distinguished, perhaps
abased; perhaps he will have children, perhaps he will not; perhaps he
will marry, perhaps not; and so on, whatever else among good things you
may name. Now look too at the evils of life: Perhaps he will have
sickness, perhaps he will have not; perhaps he will be stung by a
serpent, perhaps not; perhap he will be devoured by a wild beast,
perhaps he will not. And so look at all evils; everywhere is there a
“perhaps it will be,” and “perhaps it will not.” But canst thou say,
“Perhaps he will die,” and “perhaps he will not die”?  <span
id="fr_3182"></span>[3183](#fn_3182.md) As when medical men examine an
illness, and ascertain that it is fatal, they make this announcement;
“He will die, he will not get over this.” So from the moment of a man’s
birth, it may be said, “He will not get over this.” When he is born he
begins to be ailing. When he dies, he ends indeed this ailment: but he
knows not whether he does not fall into a worse. The rich man in the
Gospel had ended his voluptuous ailment, he came to a tormenting one.
But the poor man ended his ailment, and arrived at perfect health. <span
id="fr_3183"></span>[3184](#fn_3183.md) But he made choice in this life of
what he was to have hereafter; and what he reaped there, he sowed here.
Therefore while we live we ought to watch, and to make choice of that
which we may possess in the world to come.

<span id="vii.xlix-p16"></span>4. Let us not love the world. It
overwhelms its lovers, it conducts them to no good. We must rather
labour in it that it seduce us not, than fear lest it should fall. Lo,
the world falleth; the Christian standeth firm; because Christ doth not
fall. For wherefore saith the Lord, “Rejoice, for that I have overcome
the world”? <span id="fr_3184"></span>[3185](#fn_3184.md) We might answer
Him if we pleased, “‘Rejoice,’ yes do Thou rejoice. If Thou ‘hast
overcome,’ do thou rejoice. Why should we?” Why doth He say to us,
“Rejoice;” but because it is for us that He hath overcome, for us hath
fought? For wherein fought He? In that He took man’s nature upon Him.
Take away His birth of a virgin, take away that He emptied Himself,
“taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and
found in fashion as a man;”  <span id="fr_3185"></span>[3186](#fn_3185.md)
take away this, and where is the combat, where the contest? where the
trial? where the victory, which no battle has preceded? “In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.” <span
id="fr_3186"></span>[3187](#fn_3186.md) Could the Jews have crucified this
Word? Could those impious men have mocked this Word? Could this Word
have been buffeted? Could this Word have been crowned with thorns? But
that He might suffer all this, “the Word was made flesh;” <span
id="fr_3187"></span>[3188](#fn_3187.md) and after He had suffered all this,
by rising again He “overcame.” So then He hath “overcome” for us, to
whom He hath shown the assurance of His resurrection. Thou sayest then
to God, “Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for man hath trodden me
down.” <span id="fr_3188"></span>[3189](#fn_3188.md) Do not “tread down”
thyself, and man will not overcome thee. For, lo, some powerful man
alarms thee. By what does he alarm thee? “I will spoil thee, will
condemn, will torture, will kill thee.” And thou criest, “Have mercy
upon me, O Lord, for man hath trodden me down.” If thou say the truth,
and mark thyself well, one dead “treads thee down,” because thou art
afraid of the threats of a man; and man “treads thee down,” because thou
wouldest not be afraid, unless thou wert a man. What is the remedy then?
O man, cleave to God, by whom thou <span id="page_413">p. 413</span>
<span id="vii.xlix-Page_413"></span>wast made a man; cleave fast to Him,
put thy affiance in Him, call upon Him, let Him be thy strength. Say to
Him, “In Thee, O Lord, is my strength.” And then thou shalt sing at the
threatenings of men; and what thou shalt sing hereafter, the Lord
Himself telleth thee, “I will hope in God, I will not fear what man can
do unto me.” <span id="fr_3189"></span>[3190](#fn_3189.md)
