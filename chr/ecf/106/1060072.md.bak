<span id="vi.iv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Of the Fact that the God of the
Jews, After the Subjugation of that People, Was Still Not Accepted by
the Romans, Because His Commandment Was that He Alone Should Be
Worshipped, and Images Destroyed.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii-p2"></span>18. Furthermore, that Hebrew nation,
which, as I have said, was commissioned to prophesy of Christ, had no
other God but one God, the true God, who made heaven and earth, and all
that therein is. Under His displeasure they were ofttimes given into the
power of their enemies. And now, indeed, on account of their most
heinous sin in putting Christ to death, they have been thoroughly rooted
out of Jerusalem itself, which was the capital of their kingdom, and
have been made subject to the Roman empire. Now the Romans were in the
habit of propitiating <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) the
deities of those nations whom they conquered by worshipping these
themselves, and they were accustomed to undertake the charge of their
sacred rites. But they declined to act on that principle with regard to
the God of the Hebrew nation, either when they made their attack or when
they reduced the people. I believe that they perceived that, if they
admitted the worship of this Deity, whose commandment was that He only
should be worshipped, and that images should be destroyed, they would
have to put away from them all those objects to which formerly they had
undertaken to do religious service, and by the worship of which they
believed their empire had grown. But in this the falseness of their
demons mightily deceived them. For surely they ought to have apprehended
the fact that it is only by the hidden will of the true God, in whose
hand resides the supreme power in all things, that the kingdom was given
them and has been made to increase, and that their position was not due
to the favour of those deities who, if they could have wielded any
influence whatever in that matter, would rather have protected their own
people from being over-mastered by the Romans, or would have brought the
Romans themselves into complete subjection to them.

<span id="vi.iv.xii-p4"></span>19. Certainly they cannot possibly affirm
that the kind of piety and manners exemplified by them became objects of
love and choice on the part of the gods of the nations which they
conquered. They will never make such an assertion, if they only recall
their own early beginnings, the asylum for abandoned criminals and the
fratricide of Romulus. For when Remus and Romulus established their
asylum, with the intention that whoever took refuge there, be the crime
what it might be with which he stood charged, should enjoy impunity in
his deed, they did not promulgate any precepts of penitence for bringing
the minds of such wretched men back to a right condition. By this bribe
of impunity did they not rather arm the gathered band of fearful
fugitives against the states to which they properly belonged, and the
laws of which they dreaded? Or when Romulus slew his brother, who had
perpetrated no evil against <span id="page_85">p. 85</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xii-Page_85"></span>him, is it the case that his mind was bent
on the vindication of justice, and not on the acquisition of absolute
power? And is it true that the deities did take their delight in manners
like these, as if they were themselves enemies to their own states, in
so far as they favoured those who were the enemies of these communities?
Nay rather, neither did they by deserting them harm the one class, nor
did they by passing over to their side in any sense help the other. For
they have it not in their power to give kingship or to remove it. But
that is done by the one true God, according to His hidden counsel. And
it is not His mind to make those necessarily blessed to whom He may have
given an earthly kingdom, or to make those necessarily unhappy whom He
has deprived of that position. But He makes men blessed or wretched for
other reasons and by other means, and either by permission or by actual
gift distributes temporal and earthly kingdoms to whomsoever He pleases,
and for whatsoever period He chooses, according to the fore-ordained
order of the ages.
