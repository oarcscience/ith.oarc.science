<span id="vi.vi.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Of the Women Who Were Standing
There, and of the Question Whether Matthew, Mark, and Luke, Who Have
Stated that They Stood Afar Off, are in Antagonism with John, Who Has
Mentioned that One of Them Stood by the Cross.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xxii-p2"></span>58. Matthew proceeds thus: “And many
women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee:
among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph,
and the mother of Zebedee’s children.” <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457) Mark gives it in this form: “There
were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and
Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joseph, and Salome (who also,
when He was in Galilee, followed Him, and ministered unto Him); and many
other women which came up with Him unto Jerusalem.” <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458) I see nothing which can be supposed
to constitute a discrepancy between these writers here. For in what way
can the truth be affected by the fact that some of these women are named
in both lists, while others are referred to only in the one? Luke has
likewise connected his narrations as follows: “And all the people that
came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote
their breasts, and returned. And all His acquaintance and the women that
followed Him from Galilee stood afar off beholding these things.” <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459) Here we perceive that he is quite
in harmony with the former two as far as regards the presence of the
women, although he does not mention any of them by name. On the subject
of the multitude of people who were also present, and who, as they
beheld the things which were done, smote their breasts and returned, he
is in like manner at one with Matthew, although that evangelist has
introduced into the context this distinct statement: “Now the centurion
and they that were with him.” Thus it simply appears that Luke is the
only one who has spoken expressly of His “acquaintance” who stood afar
off. For John has also noticed the presence of the women before the Lord
gave up the ghost. His narrative runs thus: “Now there stood by the
cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of
Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and
the disciple standing by whom He loved, He saith unto His mother, Woman,
behold thy son! Then saith He to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And
from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.” <span
id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460) Now, as regards this statement, had
not Matthew and Mark at the same time mentioned Mary Magdalene most
explicitly by name, it might have been possible for us to say that there
was one company of women afar off, and another near the cross. For none
of these writers has mentioned the Lord’s mother here but John himself.
The question, therefore, which rises now is this, How can we understand
the same Mary Magdalene both to have stood afar off along with other
women, as the accounts of Matthew and Mark bear, and to have been by the
cross, as John tells us, unless it be the case that these women were at
such a distance as made it quite legitimate to say at once that they
were near, because they were at hand there in the sight of Him, and also
afar off in comparison with the crowd of people who were <span
id="page_207">p. 207</span> <span
id="vi.vi.xxii-Page_207"></span>standing round about in closer vicinity
along with the centurion and the soldiers? It is open for us, then, to
suppose that those women who were present at the scene along with the
Lord’s mother, after He commended her to the disciple, began then to
retire with the view of extricating themselves from the dense mass of
people, and of looking on at what remained to be done from a greater
distance. And in this way the rest of the evangelists, who have
introduced their notices of these women only after the Lord’s death,
have properly reported them to be standing by that time afar off.
