<span id="vii.xcvi-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.xcvi-p1.1"></span>Sermon XCIV.</span>

<span id="vii.xcvi-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.xcvi-p2.1"></span>\[CXLIV. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.xcvi-p3"></span>*On the same words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xcvi-p3.1"></span>*[John xvi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008.md)<span id="vii.xcvi-p3.2"></span>, “He
will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of
judgement.”*

<span id="vii.xcvi-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xcvi-p4.1"></span>When</span> our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
was speaking at length of the coming of the Holy Ghost, He said among
the rest, “He shall convince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and
of judgment.” <span id="fr_4260"></span>[4261](#fn_4260.md) Nor when He had
said this, did He pass on to another subject; but vouchsafed to convey a
somewhat more explicit notice of this same truth. “Of sin,” said He,
“because they believed not on Me. Of righteousness, because I go to the
Father. Of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged
already.” <span id="fr_4261"></span>[4262](#fn_4261.md) There arises
therefore within us a desire of understanding, why as if it were men’s
only sin, not to believe on Christ, He said it of this alone, that the
Holy Ghost should convince the world; but if it is plain that besides
this unbelief there are manifold other sins of men, why of this alone
should the Holy Ghost convince the world? Is it because all sins are by
unbelief retained, by faith remitted; that therefore God imputeth this
one above all the rest, by which it comes to pass that the rest are not
loosed, so long as proud man believes not in an Humbled God? For so it
is written; “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the
humble.” <span id="fr_4262"></span>[4263](#fn_4262.md) Now this grace of
God is a gift of God. But the greatest gift is the Holy Ghost Himself;
and therefore is it called grace. For forasmuch “as all had sinned, and
needed the glory of God; because by one man sin entered into the world,
and death by his sin in whom all have sinned;” <span
id="fr_4263"></span>[4264](#fn_4263.md) therefore is it grace because given
gratuitously. And therefore is it given gratuitously, because it is not
rendered as a reward after a strict scrutiny of deserts, but given as a
gift after the pardon of sins.

<span id="vii.xcvi-p9"></span>2. Therefore of sin are unbelievers, that
is, the lovers of the world, convinced; for they are signified by the
name of the world. For when it is said, “He will convince the world of
sin;” it is of none other sin than that they have not believed on
Christ. For if this sin exist not, no sins will remain, because when the
just man lives by faith, all are loosed. Now the difference is great as
to whether one believe that Jesus is Christ, or whether he believe on
Christ. For that Jesus is Christ even the devils believed, and yet the
devils believed not on Christ. For he believeth on Christ, who both
hopeth in Christ and loveth Christ. For if he have faith without hope
and love, he believeth that Christ is, but he doth not believe on
Christ. Whoso then believeth on Christ, by believing on Christ, Christ
cometh unto him, and in a manner uniteth Himself to him, and he is made
a member in His Body. Which cannot be, but by the accession of hope and
love.

<span id="vii.xcvi-p10"></span>3. What mean again His words, “Of
righteousness, because I go to the Father”? And first must we enquire,
if the world is convinced of sin, why it is also of righteousness? For
who can rightly be convinced of righteousness? Is it indeed that the
world is convinced of its own sin, but of Christ’s righteousness? I do
not see what else can be understood; since He saith, “Of sin, because
they believed not on Me. Of righteousness, because I go to the Father.”
They believed not, He goeth to the Father. Their sin therefore, and His
righteousness. But why would He name righteousness in this only, that He
goeth to the Father? Is it not righteousness also that He came hither
from the Father? Or is that rather mercy, that He came from the Father
to us, and righteousness, that He goeth to the Father?

<span id="vii.xcvi-p11"></span>4. So, Brethren, I think it expedient,
that in so profound a depth of Scripture, in words, wherein peradventure
there lies some hidden truth which may in due season be laid open, we
should as it were together enquire faithfully, that we may attain <span
id="fr_4264"></span>[4265](#fn_4264.md) to find healthfully. Why then doth
He call this righteousness, in that He goeth to the Father, and not also
in that He came from the Father? Is it that in that it is mercy that He
came, therefore it is righteousness that <span id="page_539">p.
539</span> <span id="vii.xcvi-Page_539"></span>He goeth? that so in our
own case too we may learn that righteousness cannot be fulfilled in us,
if we are slow to give a place first <span
id="fr_4265"></span>[4266](#fn_4265.md) to mercy, “not seeking our own
things, but the things of others also.” Which advice when the Apostle
had given, he immediately joined to it the example of our Lord Himself;
“Doing nothing,” saith he, “through strife or vain glory; but in
lowliness of mind, each esteeming the other better than themselves. Not
looking every man on his own things, but also on the things of others.”
Then he added immediately, “Let this mind be in each of you which was
also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the Form of God, thought it not
robbery to be equal with God; but emptied Himself, taking the form of a
servant, being made in the likeness of men, and found in fashion as a
man; He humbled Himself, having become obedient even unto death, yea the
death of the cross.” <span id="fr_4266"></span>[4267](#fn_4266.md) This is
the mercy whereby He came from the Father. What then is the
righteousness whereby He goeth to the Father? He goes on and says;
“Wherefore God also hath exalted Him, and given Him a Name which is
above every name; that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and
that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the
Glory of God the Father.” This is the righteousness whereby He goeth to
the Father.

<span id="vii.xcvi-p15"></span>5. But if He Alone goeth to the Father,
what doth it profit us? Why is the world convinced by the Holy Ghost of
this righteousness? And yet if He did not Alone go to the Father, He
would not say in another place, “No man hath ascended up to heaven, but
He That descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.” <span
id="fr_4267"></span>[4268](#fn_4267.md) But the Apostle Paul also says,
“For our conversation is in heaven.” <span
id="fr_4268"></span>[4269](#fn_4268.md) And why is this? Because he also
says, “If ye be risen with Christ, seek the things which are above,
where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Mind the things which are
above, not those which are upon the earth. For ye are dead, and your
life is hid with Christ in God.” <span
id="fr_4269"></span>[4270](#fn_4269.md) How then is He Alone? Is He
therefore Alone because Christ with all His members is One, as the Head
with His Body? Now what is His Body, but the Church? As the same teacher
says, “Now ye are the Body of Christ, and members in particular.” <span
id="fr_4270"></span>[4271](#fn_4270.md) Forasmuch then as we have fallen,
and He descended for our sakes, what is, “No man hath ascended, but He
That descended;” but that no man hath ascended, except as made one with
Him, and as a member fastened into His Body who descended? And thus He
saith to His disciples, “Without Me ye can do nothing.” <span
id="fr_4271"></span>[4272](#fn_4271.md) For in one way is He One with the
Father, and in another one with us. He is One with the Father, in that
the Substance of the Father and the Son is One; He is One with the
Father, in that, “Being in the Form of God, He thought it not robbery to
be equal with God.” But He was made One with us, in that “He emptied
Himself, taking the form of a servant;” He was made one with us,
according to the seed of Abraham, “in whom all nations shall be
blessed.” Which place when the Apostle had brought forward, he said, “He
saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy Seed,
which is Christ.” <span id="fr_4272"></span>[4273](#fn_4272.md) And for
that we too belong to that which is Christ, by our incorporation
together, and coherence to That Head, It is One Christ. And also for
that he says to us too, “Therefore are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs
according to the promise.” <span id="fr_4273"></span>[4274](#fn_4273.md)
For if the seed of Abraham be One, and That One Seed of Abraham can only
be understood of Christ; but this seed of Abraham we also are; therefore
This Whole, that is, the Head and the Body, is One Christ.

<span id="vii.xcvi-p23"></span>6. And therefore we ought not to deem
ourselves separated from that righteousness, which the Lord Himself
makes mention of, saying, “Of righteousness, because I go to the
Father.” For we too have risen with Christ, and we are with Christ our
Head, now for a while <span id="fr_4274"></span>[4275](#fn_4274.md) by
faith and hope; but our hope will be completed in the last resurrection
of the dead. But when our hope shall be completed, then shall our
justification be completed also. And the Lord who was to complete it
showed us in His Own Flesh (that is, in our Head), Wherein He rose again
and ascended to the Father, what we ought to hope for. For that thus it
is written, “He was delivered for our sins, and rose again for our
justification.” <span id="fr_4275"></span>[4276](#fn_4275.md) The world
then is convinced “of sin” in those who believe not on Christ; “and of
righteousness,” in those who rise again in the members of Christ. Whence
it is said, “That we may be the righteousness of God in him.” <span
id="fr_4276"></span>[4277](#fn_4276.md) For if not in Him, in no way
righteousness. But if in Him, He goeth with us Whole to the Father, and
this perfect righteousness will be fulfilled in us. And therefore “of
judgment” too is the world convinced, “because the prince of this world
hath been judged already;” that is, the devil, the prince of the
unrighteous, who in heart inhabit only in this world which they love,
and therefore are called “the world;” as our conversation is in heaven,
if we have risen again with Christ. Therefore as Christ together with
us, that is His Body, is One; so the devil with all the ungodly whose
head he is, with as it were his own body, is one. <span id="page_540">p.
540</span> <span id="vii.xcvi-Page_540"></span>Wherefore as we are not
separated from the righteousness, of which the Lord said, “Because I go
to the Father;” so the ungodly are not separated from that judgment, of
which He said, “Because the prince of this world hath been judged
already.”
