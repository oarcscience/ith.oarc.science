<span id="vii.xxxiii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xxxiii-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. xviii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.xxxiii-p3.2"></span>,
where we are admonished to beware of the offences of the world.*

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xxxiii-p4.1"></span>The</span> divine lessons, which we have
just heard as they were being read, warn us to gather in a stock of
virtues, to fortify a Christian heart, against the offences which were
predicted to come, and this from the mercy of the Lord. “For what is
man,” saith Scripture, “saving that <span id="page_353">p. 353</span>
<span id="vii.xxxiii-Page_353"></span>Thou art mindful of him?” <span
id="fr_2693"></span>[2694](#fn_2693.md) “Woe unto the world because of
offences,” <span id="fr_2694"></span>[2695](#fn_2694.md) saith the Lord;
the Truth says so; He alarmeth and warneth us, He would not have us to
be off our guard; for surely He would not make us desperate. Against
this “woe,” against this evil, that is, which is to be feared, and
dreaded, and guarded against, Scripture counsels, and exhorts, and
instructs us in that place, where it is said, “Great praise have they
who love Thy law, and nothing is an offence to them.” <span
id="fr_2695"></span>[2696](#fn_2695.md) He hath shown us an enemy to be
guarded against, but He hath not omitted to show us also a wall of
defence. Thou wast thinking, as thou heardest, “Woe unto the world
because of offences,” whither thou mightest go beyond the world, that
thou mightest not be exposed to offences. Therefore to avoid offences,
whither wilt thou go beyond the world, unless thou fly to Him who made
the world? And how shall we be able to fly to Him who made the world,
unless we give ear to His law which is preached everywhere? And to give
ear to it is but a small matter, unless we love it. For divine Scripture
in making thee secure against offences doth not say, “Great peace have
they who” hear “Thy law. For not the hearers of the law are just before
God. <span id="fr_2696"></span>[2697](#fn_2696.md) But” because “the doers
of the law shall be justified,” and, “faith worketh by love:” <span
id="fr_2697"></span>[2698](#fn_2697.md) it saith, “Great peace have they
who love Thy law, and nothing is an offence to them.” To this sentiment
also agrees the passage which we have chanted in course; “But the meek
shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance
of peace.” <span id="fr_2698"></span>[2699](#fn_2698.md) Because, “great
peace have they who love Thy law.” For these “meek” ones are they who
“love the law of God.” For, “Blessed is the man whom Thou chastenest, O
Lord, and teachest him out of Thy law, that Thou mayest give him rest
from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the
sinner.” <span id="fr_2699"></span>[2700](#fn_2699.md) How diverse seem
those words of Scripture, yet into one meaning do they so flow and meet
together, that whatsoever out of that most rich fountain thou canst
hear, so that thou acquiesce therein, and art in loving harmony with the
truth, thou will be at once filled with peace; glowing with love, and
fortified against offences.

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p12"></span>2. It is our place then to see, or
seek, or learn, how we must be “meek;” and we are guided by that which I
have just brought forward out of the Scriptures, to find what we are in
quest of. Be attentive then, Beloved, for a little while; it is a
weighty matter that is in hand, that we may be meek; a necessary thing
in the adversities of life. But it is not the adverse circumstances of
this life which are called offences; but mark what “offences” are. A
man, for instance, under some hard necessity is weighed down by a press
of trouble. That he is weighed down with a press of trouble, is no
offence. By such pressure were even Martyrs pressed, but not oppressed.
Of an offence beware, but of a press of trouble not so much. The last
presseth thee, an offence oppresseth thee. What then is the difference
between the two? In the press of trouble thou didst make ready to
maintain patience, to hold fast constancy, not to abandon faith, not to
consent to sin. This if thou maintain, or shall have maintained, the
trouble that presseth thee shall not be thy fall; but that press of
trouble shall avail to the same end as in the oil press, not to destroy
the olive, but to extract the oil. In a word, if in this trouble that
presseth thee thou ascribe praise unto God, how useful will the press be
to thee, whereby such oil is pressed out! Under such a press the
Apostles sat in chains, and in that press they sang a hymn to God. What
precious oil was this that was pressed and forced out! Beneath a heavy
press did Job sit on the dunghill, without resource, without help,
without substance, without children; full, but of worms only, as far,
that is, as concerned the outward man, but because he too was full of
God within, he praised God, and that press was no “offence” to him.
Where then was the “offence”? When his wife came to him and said, “Speak
a word against God, and die.” <span id="fr_2700"></span>[2701](#fn_2700.md)
When all had been taken from him by the devil, an Eve was reserved for
the exercised sufferer, not to console but to tempt her husband. See
then where the offence was. She exaggerated his miseries, and her
miseries too with his, and began to persuade him to blaspheme. But he
who was “meek,” because “God had taught him out of His law, and given
him rest from the days of adversity;” had “great peace” in his heart as
“loving the law of God, and nothing was an offence to him.” She was an
offence, but not to him. In a word, behold the meek man, behold one
taught in the law of God, the eternal law of God I mean. For that law on
tables was not yet given to the Jews in the time of Job, but in the
hearts of the godly there remained still the eternal law, from which
that which was given to the people was copied. Because then by the law
of God he had “rest given him from the days of adversity,” and “had
great peace as loving the law of God,” behold how “meek” he is, and what
he answers. Learn hereby what I propose to enquire; who are the meek.
“Thou speakest,” he says, “as one of the foolish women speaketh. If we
have received good from the hand of the Lord, shall we not bear the
evil?” <span id="fr_2701"></span>[2702](#fn_2701.md)

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span> <span id="vii.xxxiii-Page_354"></span>

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p15"></span>3. We have heard by an example who the
meek are: let us, if we can, define them in words. The meek are they, to
whom in all their good deeds, in all the things they do well, nothing is
pleasing but God; to whom in all the evils they suffer, God is not
displeasing. Now, Brethren, attend to this rule, to this pattern; let us
stretch ourselves out to it, let us seek for increase, that we may fill
it. For what does it profit, that we plant, and water, except God shall
give the increase? “For neither is he that planteth anything, neither he
that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.” <span
id="fr_2702"></span>[2703](#fn_2702.md) Give ear, whosoever thou art, that
wouldest be “meek,” who wouldest have “rest from the days of adversity,
who lovest the law of God,” that there may be “no offence unto thee,”
and that thou mayest “have great peace,” that thou mayest “possess the
earth, and delight in the multitude of peace;” give ear, whosoever thou
art that wouldest be “meek.” Whatsoever good thou doest, be not pleased
with thyself. “For God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the
humble.”  <span id="fr_2703"></span>[2704](#fn_2703.md) So then whatever
good thou doest, let nought but God be pleasing to thee; whatever evil
thou sufferest, let not God be displeasing to thee. What needest thou
more? Do this, and thou shalt live. The days of adversity shall not
overwhelm thee; thou shall escape that which is said, “Woe unto the
world because of offences.” For to what world is there woe because of
offences, but to that of which it is said, “And the world knew Him
not?” <span id="fr_2704"></span>[2705](#fn_2704.md) Not to that world of
which it is said, “God was in Christ reconciling the world unto
Himself.” <span id="fr_2705"></span>[2706](#fn_2705.md) There is an evil
world, and there is a good world; the evil world, are all the evil men
in this world; and the good world, all the good in this world. As we
observe frequently with a field. This field is full: of what? Of wheat.
Yet we say also, and say truly too, This field is full of chaff. So with
a tree, it is full of fruit. Another says, it is full of leaves. And
both he who says it is full of fruit, says true; and he who says it is
full of leaves, says true. Neither has the full display of leaves taken
away the room for the fruit, nor the full display of the fruit driven
off the abundance of leaves. It is full of both; but the one the wind
searcheth out, the other the husbandman gathereth in. So therefore when
thou dost hear, “Woe unto the world because of offences,” be not afraid;
“love the law of God, nothing shall be an offence to thee.”

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p20"></span>4. But thy wife comes to thee advising
thee to some evil thing. Thou dost love her as a wife should be loved;
she is one of thy members. “But if thine eye offend thee, if thine hand
offend thee, if thy foot offend thee,” thou hast just heard the Gospel,
“cut them off, and cast them from thee.” <span
id="fr_2706"></span>[2707](#fn_2706.md) Whosoever he be that is dear to
thee, whosoever he be that is held in high estimation by thee, let him
be so long of high esteem with thee, so long thy beloved member, as he
shall not begin to offend thee, that is, to advise thee to any evil.
Hear now how that this is the meaning of “offence.” I have brought
forward the example of Job and his wife; but there the word “offence”
did not occur. Hear the Gospel: when the Lord prophesied of His Passion,
Peter began to persuade him not to suffer. “Get thee behind Me, Satan,
thou art an offence to Me.” <span id="fr_2707"></span>[2708](#fn_2707.md)
Here undoubtedly the Lord who hath given thee an example of life, hath
taught thee both what an “offence” is, and how an offence is to be
avoided. Him to whom He had a little while before said, “Blessed art
thou, Simon Bar-jona;” <span id="fr_2708"></span>[2709](#fn_2708.md) He had
shown to be His member. But when he begins to be an offence, He cuts off
the member; only He restored the member, and put it into its place
again. He then will be an “offence” to thee, who shall begin to persuade
thee to any evil thing. And here, Beloved, take heed; this takes place
for the most part not through any evil will, but through a mistaken good
will. Thy friend who loves thee, and is loved by thee again, thy father,
thy brother, thy child, thy wife, sees thee in an evil case, and would
have thee do what is evil. What do I mean by “sees thee in an evil
case”? Sees thee in some press of trouble. This pressure it may be thou
art suffering for righteousness’ sake; art suffering it because thou
will not give false witness. I would speak merely by way of
illustration. Examples abound; for “woe to the world, because of
offences.” See, for instance, some powerful person, to cover his rapine
and plunder, asks of you the service of a false witness. You refuse:
refuse the false oath, lest thou shouldest deny Him that is true. That I
may not dwell long on this, he is angry, he is powerful, he oppresses
thee: a friend comes who would not have thee in this press of trouble,
in this evil case; “I pray thee, do what is told thee; what great matter
is it?” And then perhaps as Satan with the Lord, “It is written of Thee,
He shall give His Angels charge concerning Thee, that Thou dash not Thy
foot against a stone.”  <span id="fr_2709"></span>[2710](#fn_2709.md)
Perhaps too this friend of thine, because he sees thou art a Christian,
wishes to persuade thee out of the Law to do what he thinks you ought to
do. “Do what the other tells.” “What? Do what the other wishes.” “But it
is a lie, it is false.” “Well, have you not read, ‘All men are
liars’?” <span id="fr_2710"></span>[2711](#fn_2710.md) Now is he an <span
id="page_355">p. 355</span> <span id="vii.xxxiii-Page_355"></span>
“offence.” He is a friend, what will you do? He is an eye, he is a hand:
“Cut it off, and cast it from thee.” What is, “cut it off, and cast it
from thee”? Consent not to him. For members in our body make up unity by
consent, by consent they live, by consent are joined together one with
the other. Where there is dissent, there is disease, or a sore. He is
then one of thy members; thou wilt love him. But he is an offence to
thee; “Cut him off, and cast him from thee.” Consent not to him; drive
him off from thine ears, it may be he will return amended.

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p26"></span>5. And how wilt thou do this that I
say, “Cut him off, and cast him from thee,” and so, it may be, amend
him? answer me, how thou art going to do it? He wished to persuade thee
out of the Law to tell a lie. For he said, “speak.” And perhaps he did
not dare to say, “speak a lie;” but thus, “speak what the other wishes.”
Thou sayest, “But it is a lie.” And he to excuse it, says, “All men are
liars.” Then do thou, my brother, say against this, “The mouth that
lieth slayeth the soul.” <span id="fr_2711"></span>[2712](#fn_2711.md)
Mark, it is no light thing thou hast heard, “The mouth that lieth
slayeth the soul.” What can that powerful enemy, who oppresseth me, do
to me, that thou pitiest me, and my condition, and wouldest not have me
be in this evil case; whereas thou wouldest that I should be evil? What
can that powerful man do to me, and what can he oppress? The flesh. He
can oppress thy body, thou wilt say: I grant he may oppress it to
destruction. <span id="fr_2712"></span>[2713](#fn_2712.md) Still how much
more mildly does he deal with me, than I should with myself were I to
lie! He kills my flesh; I kill my soul. He in his power and anger slays
the body; “the mouth that lieth slayeth the soul.” He slays the body;
and die it must, though it should not be slain; but the soul which
iniquity slayeth not, the truth receiveth for ever. Preserve then what
thou canst preserve; and let that perish which must perish sometime or
other. Thou hast given an answer then, but thou hast not solved the “All
men are liars.” Make answer to him to this too, that he may not fancy
that he has said anything to persuade to lying, in bringing a testimony
out of the Law; so urging thee out of the Law against the Law. For it is
written in the Law, “Thou shalt not bear false witness;” <span
id="fr_2713"></span>[2714](#fn_2713.md) and it is written in the Law, “All
men are liars.” Recur then to that which I just lately suggested, when I
defined in words as best I could the “meek” man. He is “meek” to whom in
all things that he does well, nothing but God is pleasing, and in all
the evils which he suffers, God is not displeasing. Make answer then to
him who says, Lie, for it is written, “All men are liars:” I will not
lie, for it is written, “The mouth that lieth slayeth the soul.” I will
not lie, because it is written, “Thou shalt destroy them that speak
lying.” <span id="fr_2714"></span>[2715](#fn_2714.md) I will not lie,
because it is written, “Thou shalt not bear false witness.” Though he
whom I displease by the truth harass my body with oppressions, I will
give ear to my Lord, “Fear not them which kill the body.” <span
id="fr_2715"></span>[2716](#fn_2715.md)

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p32"></span>6. “How then are all men liars? What!
Thou art not a man, I suppose?” Answer quickly and truly. “And O that I
may not be a man, that so I may not be a liar.” For see; “God looked
down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that
did understand, and seek after God. They are all gone out of the way,
they are all together become unprofitable: there is none that doeth
good, no not even one.” <span id="fr_2716"></span>[2717](#fn_2716.md) Why?
Because they wished to be sons of men. But in order that he might
deliver them from these iniquities, cure, heal, change, the sons of men;
“he gave them power to become the sons of God.” <span
id="fr_2717"></span>[2718](#fn_2717.md) What marvel then! Ye were men, if
we were the sons of men; ye were all men, and were liars, for, “All men
are liars.” The grace of God came to you, and “gave you power to become
the sons of God.” Hear the voice of My Father saying, “I have said, Ye
are gods; and ye are all the children of the Most High.” <span
id="fr_2718"></span>[2719](#fn_2718.md) Since then they are men, and the
sons of men, if they are not the children of the Most High, they are
liars, for, “all men are liars.” If they are the sons of God, if they
have been redeemed by the Saviour’s grace, if purchased with His
precious Blood, if born again of water and of the Spirit, if
predestinated to the inheritance of heaven, then indeed are they
children of God. And so thereby are gods. What then would a lie have to
do with thee? For Adam was a mere man, Christ, man and God; God, the
Creator of all creation. Adam a mere man, the Man Christ, the Mediator
with God, the Only Son of the Father, the God-man. Lo, thou, O man, art
far from God, and God is far above man; between them the God-man placed
Himself. Acknowledge Christ, and by Him as Man ascend up to God.

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p36"></span>7. Being then now reformed, and, if my
words have been so blessed, “meek,” let us “hold fast our profession
without wavering.” Let us love the law of God, that we may escape that
which is written, “Woe unto the world because of offences.” Now I would
say a few words about “offences,” of which the world is full, and how it
is that offences thicken, pressing troubles abound. The world <span
id="fr_2719"></span>[2720](#fn_2719.md) is laid waste, the winepress is
trodden. Ah! Christians, heavenly shoot, ye strangers on the earth, who
seek a city in heaven, who long to be associated with the holy Angels;
under<span id="page_356">p. 356</span> <span
id="vii.xxxiii-Page_356"></span>stand that ye have come here on this
condition only, that ye should soon depart. Ye are passing on through
the world, endeavouring to reach Him who created it. Let not the lovers
of the world, who wish to remain in the world, and yet, whether they
will or no, are compelled to move from it; let them not disturb you, let
them not deceive nor seduce you. These pressing troubles are not
offences. Be ye righteous, and they will be only exercises. Tribulation
comes; it will be as ye choose it, either an exercise, or a
condemnation. Such as it shall find you to be, will it be. Tribulation
is a fire; does it find thee gold? it takes away the filth: does it find
thee chaff? it turns it into ashes. The pressing troubles then which
abound are not “offences.” But what are “offences”? Those expressions,
those words in which we are thus addressed. “See what Christian times
bring about;” lo, these are the true offences. For this is said to thee,
to this end, that if thou love the world, thou mayest blaspheme Christ.
And this he saith to thee who is thy friend, and counsellor; and so
“thine eye.” This he saith to thee who ministereth to thee, and shareth
thy labours, and so “thine hand.” This he saith to thee it may be who
supporteth thee, who lifteth thee up from a low earthly state; and so
“thy foot.” Cast them all aside, cut them off, throw them all away from
thee; consent not unto them. Answer such men, as he who was advised to
give false witness answered. So do thou answer too; say to the man who
saith to thee, “See, it is in Christian times that there are such
pressing troubles; that the whole world is laid waste;” answer him, “And
this Christ foretold me, before it came to pass.”

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p38"></span>8. For wherefore art thou disturbed?
Thine heart is disturbed by the pressing troubles of the world, as that
ship was, in which Christ was asleep. Lo! what is the cause,
stout-hearted man, that thy heart is disturbed? That ship in which
Christ is asleep, <span id="fr_2720"></span>[2721](#fn_2720.md) is the
heart in which faith is asleep. For what new thing, what new thing, I
ask, is told thee, Christian? “In Christian times is the world laid
waste, the world is failing.” Did not thy Lord tell thee, the world
shall be laid waste? Did not thy Lord tell thee, the world shall fail?
Why when the promise was made, didst thou believe, and art disturbed
now, when it is being completed? So then the tempest beats furiously
against thine heart; beware of shipwreck, awake up Christ. The Apostle
says, “that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.” <span
id="fr_2721"></span>[2722](#fn_2721.md) Christ dwelleth in thee by faith.
Present faith, is Christ present; waking faith, is Christ awake;
slumbering <span id="fr_2722"></span>[2723](#fn_2722.md) faith, is Christ
asleep. Arise and stir thyself; say, “Lord, we perish.” See what the
Heathen say to us; and what is worse, what evil Christians say! Awake
up, O Lord, we perish. Let thy faith awake, and Christ begins to speak
to thee. “‘Why art thou troubled?’ I told thee beforehand of all these
things. I foretold them, that when evils came, thou mightest hope for
good things, that thou mightest not faint in the evil.” Wonderest thou
that the world is failing? Wonder that the world is grown old. It is as
a man who is born, and grows up, and waxes old. There are many
complaints in old age; the cough, the rheum, the weakness of the eyes,
fretfulness, and weariness. So then as when a man is old; he is full of
complaints; so is the world old; and is full of troubles. Is it a little
thing that God hath done for thee, in that in the world’s old age, He
hath sent Christ unto thee, that He may renew thee then, when all is
failing? Dost thou not know that He notified this in the seed of
Abraham? “The seed of Abraham,” says the Apostle, “which is Christ. He
saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of One, And to thy seed,
which is Christ.” <span id="fr_2723"></span>[2724](#fn_2723.md) Therefore
was there a son born to Abraham in his old age, because in the old age
of this world was Christ to come. He came when all things were growing
old, and made them new. As a made, created, perishing thing, the world
was now declining to its fall. It could not but be that it should abound
in troubles; He came both to console thee in the midst of present
troubles, and to promise thee everlasting rest. Choose not then to
cleave to this aged world, and to be unwilling to grow young in Christ,
who telleth thee, “The world is perishing, the world is waxing old, the
world is failing; is distressed by the heavy breathing of old age. But
do not fear, “Thy youth shall be renewed as the eagle’s.” <span
id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724.md)

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p44"></span>9. See, they say, in Christian times it
is that Rome perishes. Perhaps Rome is not perishing; perhaps she is
only scourged, not utterly destroyed; perhaps she is chastened, not
brought to nought. It may be so; Rome will not perish, if the Romans do
not perish. And perish they will not if they praise God; perish they
will if they blaspheme Him. For what is Rome, but the Romans? For the
question is not of her wood and stones, of her lofty insulated  <span
id="fr_2725"></span>[2726](#fn_2725.md) palaces, and all her spacious
walls. All this was made only on this condition that it should fall some
other day. When man built it, he laid stone on stone; and when man
destroyed it, he removed stone from stone. Man made it, man destroyed
it. Is any injury done to Rome, because it is said, “She is falling”?
No, not to Rome, but to her builder perhaps. Do we then its builder any
injury, because we say, Rome is falling, which Romulus built? <span
id="page_357">p. 357</span> <span id="vii.xxxiii-Page_357"></span>This
world itself will be burnt with fire, which God built. But neither does
what man has made fall to ruin, except when God wills it; nor what God
has made, except when He wills. For if the work of man fall not without
God’s will, how can God’s work fall by the will of man? Yet God both
made the world that was one day to fall for thee; and therefore made He
thee as one who was one day to die. Man himself, the city’s ornament,
man himself, the city’s inhabitant, ruler, governor, comes on this
condition that he may go, is born on this condition that he may die,
entered into the world on this condition that he may pass away; “Heaven
and earth shall pass away:” <span id="fr_2726"></span>[2727](#fn_2726.md)
what wonder then if some time or other there should be an end of a
single city? And yet peradventure the city’s end is not come now; yet
some time or other come it will. But why does Rome perish amid the
sacrifices of Christians? Why was her mother Troy burnt amid the
sacrifices of Heathens? The gods in whom the Romans have placed all
their hope, yea the Roman gods in whom the Heathen Romans placed their
hope, removed from the flames of Troy to found Rome. These very gods of
Rome were originally the gods of Troy. Troy was burnt, and Æneas took
the fugitive gods; yea rather himself a fugitive he took away these
senseless gods. For they could be carried by the fugitive; but they
could not flee away themselves. And coming with these gods into Italy,
with these false gods, he founded Rome. It is too long to go through the
whole story; yet would I briefly mention what their own writings
contain. An author of theirs well known to all speaks thus; “As I have
received the account, the Trojans who under the guidance of Æneas were
wandering about as fugitives without any settled abode, originally built
and inhabited Rome.” <span id="fr_2727"></span>[2728](#fn_2727.md) So they
had their gods with them, they builded Rome in Latium, and there they
placed the gods to be worshipped, which before were worshipped in Troy.
Juno is introduced by their poet, incensed against Æneas and the
fugitive Trojans, saying,

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p48"></span>“A race of wandering slaves abhorred by
me,

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p49"></span>With prosperous passage cuts the Tuscan
sea,

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p50"></span>To fruitful Italy their course they
steer,

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p51"></span>And for their vanquished gods, design
new temples

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p52"></span>there.” <span

<span id="vii.xxxiii-p54"></span>Now when these vanquished gods were
carried into Italy, was it as a protecting deity, or <span
id="fr_2729"></span>[2730](#fn_2729.md) as a presage <span
id="fr_2730"></span>[2731](#fn_2730.md) of their future fall? “Love”
therefore “the law of God, and nothing shall be an offence to you.” We
pray you, we beseech you, we exhort you; be meek, sympathize with the
suffering, bear the weak; and on this occasion of the concourse of so
many strangers, and needy, and suffering people, let your hospitality
and your good works abound. Let but Christians do what Christ enjoineth,
and so will the Heathen blaspheme only to their own hurt.
