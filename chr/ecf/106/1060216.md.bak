<span id="vi.vii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Of the Evangelist John, and the
Distinction Between Him and the Other Three.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.xi-p2"></span>11. John remains, between whom and others
there is left no comparison to be instituted. For, however the
evangelists may each have reported some matters which are not recorded
by the others, it will be hard to prove that any question involving real
discrepancy arises out of these. Thus, too, it is a clearly admitted
position that the first three—namely, Matthew, Mark, and Luke—have
occupied themselves chiefly with the humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ,
according to which He is both king and priest. And in this way, Mark,
who seems to answer to the figure of the man in the well-known mystical
symbol of the four living creatures, <span
id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626.md) either appears to be preferentially
the companion of Matthew, as he narrates a larger number of matters in
unison with him than with the rest, and therein acts in due harmony with
the idea of the kingly character whose wont it is, as I have stated in
the first book, <span id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md) to be not
unaccompanied by attendants; or else, in accordance with the more
probable account of the matter, he holds a course in conjunction with
both \[the other Synoptists\]. For although he is at one with Matthew in
the larger number of passages, he is nevertheless at one rather with
Luke in some others. And this very fact shows him to stand related at
once to the lion and to the steer, that is to say, to the kingly office
which Matthew emphasizes, and to the sacerdotal which Luke introduces,
wherein also Christ appears distinctively as man, as the figure which
Mark sustains stands related to both these. On the other hand, Christ’s
divinity, in virtue of which He is equal to the Father, in accordance
with which He is the Word, and God with God, and the Word that was made
flesh in order to dwell among us, <span
id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628.md) in accordance with which also He
and the Father are one, <span id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629.md) has
been taken specially <span id="page_231">p. 231</span> <span
id="vi.vii.xi-Page_231"></span>in hand by John with a view to its
recommendation to our minds. Like an eagle, he abides among Christ’s
sayings of the sublimer order, and in no way descends to earth but on
rare occasions. In brief, although he declares plainly his own knowledge
of the Lord’s mother, he nevertheless neither unites with Matthew and
Luke in recording His nativity, nor associates himself with all the
three in relating His baptism; but all that he does there is simply to
present the testimony delivered by John in a lofty and sublime fashion,
and then, quitting the company of these others, he proceeds with Him to
the marriage in Cana of Galilee. And there, although the evangelist
himself mentions His mother by that very name, He nevertheless addresses
her thus: “Woman, what have I to do with thee?” <span
id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md) In this, however, \[it is to be
understood that\] He does not repel her of whom He received the flesh,
but means to convey the conception of His divinity with special fitness
at this time, when He is about to change the water into wine; which
divinity, likewise, had made that woman, and had not itself been made in
her.

<span id="vi.vii.xi-p8"></span>12. Then, after noticing the few days
spent in Capharnaum, the evangelist comes again to the temple, where he
states that Jesus spoke of the temple of His body in these terms:
“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up:” <span
id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631.md) in which declaration emphatic
intimation is given not only that God was in that temple in the person
of the Word that was made flesh, but also that He Himself raised the
said flesh to life, in the veritable exercise of that prerogative which
He has in His oneness with the Father, and according to which He does
not act separately from Him; whereas it will perhaps be found that, in
all other passages, the phrase which Scripture employs is one to the
effect that God raised Him: neither is there any such expression found
anywhere else as that, when God raised Christ, Christ also raised
Himself, because He is one God with the Father; which is the import of
the passage now before us, in which He says, “Destroy this temple, and
in three days I will raise it up.”

<span id="vi.vii.xi-p10"></span>13. Then how great and how divine are
the words reported to have been spoken with Nicodemus! From these the
evangelist proceeds again to the testimony of John, and brings before
our notice the fact, that the friend of the bridegroom cannot but
rejoice because of the bridegroom’s voice. In this statement He gives us
to understand that the soul of man neither has light derivable from
itself, nor can have blessing, except by participation in the
unchangeable wisdom. Thereafter he carries us on to the case of the
woman of Samaria, in connection with which mention is made of the water,
whereof if a man drinks, he shall never thirst again. Once more, he
brings us again to Cana of Galilee, where Jesus had made the water wine.
In that narrative he tells us how He spoke to the nobleman, whose son
was sick, in these terms: “Except ye see signs and wonders ye believe
not:” <span id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md) in which saying He aims
at lifting the mind of the believer high above all things mutable, so
that He would not have even the miracles themselves, which, however they
may bear the impression of what is divine, are yet wrought in the
instance of what is changeable in bodies, made objects of seeking on the
part of the faithful.

<span id="vi.vii.xi-p12"></span>14. Next he brings us back to Jerusalem,
and tells the story of the healing of the man who had an infirmity of
thirty-eight years’ standing. What words are spoken on this occasion,
and how ample is the discourse! Here we are met by the sentence, “The
Jews sought to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but said
also that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God.” <span
id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md) In this passage it is made
sufficiently plain that He did not speak of God as His Father in the
ordinary sense in which holy men are in the habit of using the phrase,
but that He meant that He is His equal. For, a little before this, He
had said to those who were impeaching Him with violating the
Sabbath-day, “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.” <span
id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md) Then their fury flamed forth, not
merely because He said that God was His Father, but because He wished it
to be understood that He was equal with God, when He used the phrase,
“My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.” In which utterance He also
shows it to be matter of course that, as the Father works, the Son
should work also; because the Father does not work without the Son. And
this is in accordance with what He states a little further on in the
same passage, when these parties were incensed at His declaration,
namely, “For what things soever He doeth, these also doeth the Son
likewise.” <span id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md)

<span id="vi.vii.xi-p16"></span>15. Then at length John descends to bear
company with the other three, whose course is with the same Lord, but
upon the earth, and joins them in recording the feeding of the five
thousand men with the five loaves. In this narrative, however, he is the
only one who mentions, that when the people wished to make Him a king,
Jesus departed into a mountain Himself alone. <span
id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md) And in making that statement, his
intention appears to me to have been just to communicate to the
reasonable soul the truth, that Christ reigns over our mind and reason
purely in a sphere in which He is exalted above <span id="page_232">p.
232</span> <span id="vi.vii.xi-Page_232"></span>us, in which He has no
community of nature with men, and in which He is verily by Himself
alone, as He is the Father’s only fellow. This, however, is a mystical
truth, which escapes the cognizance of carnal men, whose life creeps
upon the lower soil of this earth, just because it is so sublime a
mystery. Hence Christ Himself also departs into the mountain from the
men whose habit is to seek for His kingdom with earthly conceptions of
it. Thus is it that He expresses Himself elsewhere to this effect, “My
kingdom is not of this world.” <span
id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) And this, again, is something which
is reported only by John, who soars high over earth in a kind of
ethereal flight, and delights himself in the light of the Sun of
righteousness. Then, on passing from the narrative connected with this
mountain, and from the miracle of the five loaves, he still keeps
company with the same three for a little while, until the notice of the
crossing of the sea is reached, and the occasion on which Jesus walked
upon the waters. But at this point he at once rises again to the region
of the Lord’s discourses, and relates those words, so grave, so
lengthened, so sustainedly lofty and elevated, which had their occasion
in the multiplying of the bread, when He addressed the multitudes to the
following effect: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye seek me, not
because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and
were filled. Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat
which endureth unto everlasting life.” <span
id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md) After which sayings, He continues
to discourse in similar terms for a very long period, and in the most
exalted strain. At that time, some fell away from the sublime teaching
of such words, namely, those who walked no more with Him afterwards. But
there were also those who did cleave to Him; and these were they who
were able to receive the meaning of this saying, “It is the spirit that
quickeneth, but the flesh profiteth nothing.” <span
id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md) For surely it is true, that even
through the flesh it is the spirit that profiteth, <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) and the spirit alone that
profiteth; whereas the flesh without the spirit profiteth nothing.

<span id="vi.vii.xi-p22"></span>16. Next we come to the passage where
His brethren—that is to say, His relations according to the flesh—urge
Him to go up to the feast-day, in order that He may have an opportunity
of making Himself known to the multitude. And here, again, how supremely
elevated is the tone of His reply! “My time is not yet come, but your
time is alway ready. The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth,
because I testify of it that the works thereof are evil.”  <span
id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641.md) So it is the case, then, that “your
time is alway ready,” because ye desire that kind of day to which the
prophet refers when he says, “But I have not laboured following Thee, O
Lord; and the day of man I have not desired, Thou knowest:” <span
id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642.md) that is to say, to soar to the
light of the Word, and to desire that day which Abraham desired to see,
and which he did see, and was glad. <span
id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643.md) And again, how wonderful, how
divine, how sublime are the words which John represents Him to have
spoken after He had gone up to the temple, at the time of the feast!
They are such as these: that where He was about to go, thither they
could not come; <span id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644.md) that they
both knew Him, and knew whence He was; <span
id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645.md) that He who sent Him is true, whom
they knew not, <span id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646.md) which is much
the same as if He had said, “Ye both know whence I am, and know not
whence I am.” And what else did He wish to be understood by such
utterances, but that it was possible for Him to be known to them
according to the flesh, in respect of lineage and country, but that, so
far as regarded His divinity, He was unknown to them? On this occasion,
too, when He spoke of the gift of the Holy Spirit, He showed them who He
was, inasmuch as He could hold the power of bestowing that highest boon.

<span id="vi.vii.xi-p29"></span>17. Again, how weighty are the things
which this evangelist reports Jesus to have spoken, when He came back to
the temple from Mount Olivet, and after the forgiveness which He
extended to the adulteress, who had been brought before Him by His
tempters, as one deserving to be stoned: on which occasion He wrote with
His finger upon the ground, as if He would indicate that people of the
character of these men would be written on earth, and not in heaven, as
He also admonished His disciples to rejoice that their names were
written in heaven! <span id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647.md) Or, it may
be that He meant to convey the idea that it was by humbling Himself
(which He expressed by bending down His head) that He wrought signs upon
the earth; or, that the time was now come when His law should be
written, not, as formerly, on the sterile stone, but on a soil which
would yield fruit. Accordingly, after these incidents, He affirmed
Himself to be the light of the world, and declared that he who followed
Him would not walk in darkness, but would have the light of life. He
said, also, that He was “the beginning which also discoursed to
them.” <span id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648.md) By which designation
He clearly distinguished Himself from the light which He made, and
presented Himself as the Light by which all things have been made.
Consequently, when He said that He was the light <span id="page_233">p.
233</span> <span id="vi.vii.xi-Page_233"></span>of the world, we are not
to take the words to bear simply the sense intended when He addressed
the disciples in similar terms, saying, “Ye are the light of the world.”
For they are compared only to the kindled light, which is not to be put
beneath a bushel, but to be set upon a candlestick; <span
id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649.md) as He also says of John the
Baptist, that “he was a burning and shining light.” <span
id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650.md) But He is Himself the beginning, of
whom it is likewise declared, that “of His fulness have all we
received.” <span id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651.md) On the occasion
presently under review, He asserted further that He, the Son, is the
Truth, which will make us free, and without which no man will be
free. <span id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652.md)

<span id="vi.vii.xi-p36"></span>18. Next, after telling the story of the
giving of sight to the man who was blind from his birth, John tarries
for a space over the copious discourse to which that incident gave
occasion, on the subject of the sheep, and the shepherd, and the door,
and the power of laying down His life and taking it again, wherein He
gave token of the supreme might of His divinity. Thereafter, he relates
how, at the time when the feast of the dedication was being celebrated
in Jerusalem, the Jews said to Him, “How long dost thou make us to
doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.” <span
id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653.md) And then he reports the sublime
words which the Lord uttered when the opportunity thus arose for a
discourse. It was on this occasion that He said, “I and my Father are
one.” <span id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654.md) After this, again, he
brings before us the raising of Lazarus from the dead: in connection
with which miracle the Lord said, “I am the resurrection and the life:
he that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.” <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655.md) In these words what do we recognise
but the sublimity of the Godhead of Him, in fellowship with whom we
shall live for ever? Once more, John joins Matthew and Mark in what is
recorded about Bethany, where the scene took place with the precious
ointment which was poured upon His feet and His head by Mary. <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656.md) And then, on to the Lord’s passion
and resurrection, John keeps by the other three evangelists, but only in
so far as his narrative engages itself with the same places.

<span id="vi.vii.xi-p41"></span>19. Moreover, so far as regards the
Lord’s discourses, he does not cease to ascend to the sublimer and more
extended utterances of which, from this point also, He delivered
Himself. For he inserts a lofty address which the Lord spoke on the
occasion when, through Philip and Andrew, the Gentiles expressed their
desire to see Him, and which is introduced by none of the other
evangelists. There, too, he reports the remarkable words which were
spoken again on the subject of the light which enlightens and makes men
the children of light. <span id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657.md)
Thereafter, in connection with the Supper itself, of which none of the
evangelists has failed to give us some notice, how affluent and how
lofty are those words of Jesus which John records, but which the others
have passed over in silence! I may instance not only His commendation of
humility, when He washed the disciples’ feet, but also that marvellously
overpowering and pre-eminently copious discourse which the Lord
delivered to the eleven who remained with Him after His betrayer had
been indicated by the morsel of bread, and had gone out. It was in this
discourse, over which John lingers long, that He said, “He that hath
seen me, hath seen the Father also.” <span
id="fr_1658"></span>[1659](#fn_1658.md) It was in it, too, that He
expressed Himself so largely about the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, whom
He was to send to them, and about His own glory, which He had with the
Father before the world was, and about His making us one in Himself,
even as He and the Father are one,—not that He and the Father and we
should be one, but that we should be one as they are one. And many other
things of a wonderfully sublime order did He utter in that connection.
But who can fail to see that to discuss such themes in any manner that
would be worthy of them, even if we were competent to do so, is at least
not the task which we have undertaken in the present effort? For our
object is to help those who are lovers of the Word of God and students
of holy truth to understand that, in his Gospel, John was indeed an
announcer and preacher of the same Christ, the true and truthful One of
whom the other three who have composed Gospels also testified, and to
whom the rest of the apostles likewise bore witness, who, although they
did not take in hand the construction of written narratives, did at
least discharge the kindred service in officially preaching of Him: but
that, at the same time, he was borne to far loftier heights in the
doctrine of Christ from the very beginning of his book, and that it was
but on rare occasions that he kept to the level pursued by the others.
These occasions were the following in particular, namely: first by the
Jordan, in reference to the testimony of John the Baptist; secondly, on
the other side of the sea of Tiberias, when the Lord fed the multitudes
with the five loaves, and walked upon the waters; thirdly, in Bethany,
where He had the precious ointment poured over Him by the devotion of a
woman of faith. And so he proceeds, until he meets them at the time of
the Passion, which, as matter of course, he had to relate in conjunction
with them. But, even in that section, and <span id="page_234">p.
234</span> <span id="vi.vii.xi-Page_234"></span>on the particular
subject of the Lord’s Supper, which has been left unnoticed by none of
them, he has presented us with a much more affluent statement, as if he
drew his materials directly from the treasure-store of that bosom of the
Lord on which it was his wont to recline. Then, again, \[John shows us
how\] He astonishes Pilate with words of a sublimer import, declaring
that His kingdom is not of this world, and that He was born a King, and
that He came into the world for this purpose, that He might bear witness
to the truth. <span id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659.md) \[It is in this
Gospel also that\] He withdraws Himself <span
id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660.md) from Mary with some deep mystical
intention after His resurrection, and says to her, “Touch me not; for I
am not yet ascended to my Father.” <span
id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661.md) It is here, too, that He imparts
the Holy Spirit to the disciples by breathing on them <span
id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662.md) giving us thereby to understand
that this Spirit who is consubstantial and co-eternal with the Trinity,
should not be considered to be simply the Spirit of the Father, but
should also be held to be the Spirit of the Son.

<span id="vi.vii.xi-p48"></span>20. Finally, He here commits His sheep
to the care of Peter, who loves Him, and thrice confesses that love, and
then He states that He wills this very John so to tarry until He
comes. <span id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663.md) In which utterance,
again, He seems to me to have conveyed in a profound and mystical way
the fact that this <span id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664.md)
evangelical stewardship of John’s, in which he is borne aloft into the
most liquid light of the Word, <span
id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665.md) where it is possible to behold the
equality and unchangeableness of the Trinity, and in which, above all,
we see at what a distance from all others in respect of essential
character that humanity stands by whose assumption it occurred that the
Word was made flesh, cannot be clearly discerned and recognised until
the Lord Himself comes. Consequently, it will tarry thus until He comes.
At present it will tarry in the faith of believers, but hereafter it
will be possible to contemplate it face to face, <span
id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666.md) when He, our Life, shall appear,
and when we shall appear with Him in glory. <span
id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667.md) But if any one supposes that with
man, living, as he still does, in this mortal life, it may be possible
for a person to dispel and clear off every obscurity induced by
corporeal and carnal fancies, and to attain to the serenest light of
changeless truth, and to cleave constantly and unswervingly to that with
a mind thoroughly estranged from the course of this present life, that
man understands neither what he asks, nor who he is that put such a
supposition. Let such an individual rather accept the authority, at once
lofty and free from all deceitfulness, which tells us that, as long as
we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord, and that we walk by
faith and not by sight. <span id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668.md) And
thus, with all perseverance keeping and guarding his faith and hope and
charity, let him look forward to the sight which is promised, in
accordance with that earnest which we have received of the Holy Ghost,
who shall teach us all truth, <span id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669.md)
when God, who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall also quicken
our mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in us. <span
id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670.md) But before this body, which is dead
by reason of sin, is quickened, it is without doubt corruptible, and
presseth down the soul. <span id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671.md) And
if, in the body, man is ever helped to reach beyond the cloud with which
the whole earth is covered, <span id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672.md)
—that is to say, beyond this carnal darkness with which the whole life
of earth is covered,—it is simply as if he were touched with a rapid
coruscation, only to sink swiftly into his natural infirmity, the desire
surviving by which he may again be excited (to what is evil), and the
purity being insufficient to establish him (in what is good). The more,
however, any one can do this, the greater is he; while the less he can
do so, the less is he. And if the mind of a man has as yet had no such
experience—in which mind nevertheless Christ dwells by faith—he ought to
strive earnestly to diminish the lusts of this world, and to make an end
of them by the exercise of moral virtue, walking, as it were, in the
company of these three evangelists with Christ the Mediator. And, with
the joy of large hope, let him in faith hold Him who is alway the Son of
God, but who, for our sakes, became the Son of man, in order that His
eternal power and Godhead might be united with  <span
id="fr_1673"></span>[1674](#fn_1673.md) our weakness and mortality, and, on
the basis of what is ours, make a way for us in Himself and to Himself.
That a man may be kept from sinning, he should be ruled by Christ the
King. If he happens to sin, he may obtain remission from Christ, who is
also priest. And thus, nurtured in the exercise of a good conversation
and life, and borne out of the atmosphere of earth on the wings of a
twofold love, as on a pair of strong pinions, so may he be enlightened
by the same Christ, who is also the Word, the Word who was in the
beginning, the Word who was with God, and the Word who was God; and
although that will still be through a glass darkly, it will be a sublime
kind of illumination far superior to every corporeal similitude.
Wherefore, although it is the gifts of the active virtue <span
id="page_235">p. 235</span> <span id="vi.vii.xi-Page_235"></span>that
shine pre-eminent in the first three evangelists, while it is the gift
of the contemplative virtue that discerns such subjects, nevertheless,
this Gospel of John, in so far as it also is in part, will so tarry
until that which is perfect comes. <span
id="fr_1674"></span>[1675](#fn_1674.md) And to one, indeed, is given by the
Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same
Spirit. <span id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675.md) One man regardeth the
day to the Lord; <span id="fr_1676"></span>[1677](#fn_1676.md) another
receives a clearer draught from the breast of the Lord; another is
caught up even to the third heaven, and hears unspeakable words. <span
id="fr_1677"></span>[1678](#fn_1677.md) But all, as long as they are in the
body, are absent from the Lord. <span
id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678.md) And for all believers living in the
good hope, whose names are written in the book of life, there is still
in reserve that which is referred to in the words, “And I will love him,
and will manifest myself unto him.” <span
id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679.md) Nevertheless, the greater the
advance which a man may make in the apprehension and knowledge of this
theme during the time of this absence from the Lord, all the more
carefully should he guard against those devilish vices, pride and envy.
Let him remember that this very Gospel of John, which urges us so
pre-eminently to the contemplation of truth, gives a no less remarkable
prominence to the inculcation of the sweet grace of charity. Let him
also consider that most true and wholesome precept which is couched in
the words, “The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all.” <span
id="fr_1680"></span>[1681](#fn_1680.md) For the evangelist who presents
Christ to us in a far loftier strain of teaching than all the others, is
also the one in whose narrative the Lord washes the disciples’
feet. <span id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681.md)
