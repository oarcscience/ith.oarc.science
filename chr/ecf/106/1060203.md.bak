<span id="vi.vi.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Of the Absence of All
Discrepancies in the Narratives Constructed by the Four Evangelists on
the Subject of the Events Which Took Place About the Time of the Lord’s
Resurrection.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xxv-p2"></span>61. Matthew proceeds thus: “And there was
there Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the
sepulchre.” <span id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473.md) This is given by
Mark as follows: “And Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Joseph,
beheld where He was laid.” <span id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474.md) So
far it is evident that there is no kind of inconsistency between the
accounts.

<span id="vi.vi.xxv-p5"></span>62. Matthew continues in these terms:
“Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief
priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, saying, Sir, we have
remembered that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days
I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure
until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him
away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last
error shall be worse than the first. Pilate said unto them, Ye have a
watch; go your way, make it as sure as ye can. So they went, and made
the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.” <span
id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475.md) This narrative is given only by
Matthew. Nothing, however, is stated by any of the others which can have
the appearance of contrariety.

<span id="vi.vi.xxv-p7"></span>63. Again, the same Matthew carries on
his recital as follows: “Now, in the evening of the Sabbath, <span
id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476.md) when it began to dawn towards the
first day of the week,  <span id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477.md) came
Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre. And, behold,
there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from
heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon
it. And his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as
snow: and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.
And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know
that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here; for He is
risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay: And go
quickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead; and,
behold, He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him: lo, I
have told you.” <span id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478.md) Mark is in
harmony with this. It is possible, however, that some difficulty may be
felt in the circumstance that, according to Matthew’s version, the stone
was already rolled away from the sepulchre, and the angel was sitting
upon it. For Mark tells us that the women entered into the sepulchre,
and there saw a young man sitting on the right side, covered with a long
white garment, and that they were affrighted. <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479.md) But the explanation may be, that
Matthew has simply said nothing about the angel whom they saw when they
entered into the sepulchre, and that Mark has said nothing about the one
whom they saw sitting outside upon the stone. In this way they would
have seen two angels, and have got two separate angelic reports relating
to Jesus,—namely, first one from the angel whom they saw sitting outside
upon the stone, and then another from the angel whom they saw sitting on
the right side when they entered into the sepulchre. Thus, too, the
injunction given them by the angel who was sitting outside, and which
was conveyed in the words, “Come, and see the place where the Lord lay,”
would have served to encourage them to go within the tomb; on coming to
which, as has been said, and venturing within it, we may suppose them to
have seen the angel concerning whom Matthew tells us nothing, but of
whom Mark discourses, sitting on the right <span id="page_209">p.
209</span> <span id="vi.vi.xxv-Page_209"></span>side, from whom also
they heard things of like tenor to those they had previously listened
to. Or if this explanation is not satisfactory, we ought certainly to
accept the theory that, as they entered into the sepulchre, they came
within a section of the ground where, it is reasonable to suppose, a
certain space had been by that time securely enclosed, extending a
little distance in front of the rock which had been cut out in order to
construct the place of sepulture; so that, according to this view, what
they really beheld was the one angel sitting on the right side, in the
space thus referred to, which same angel Matthew also represents to have
been sitting upon the stone which he had rolled away from the mouth of
the tomb when the earthquake took place, that is to say, from the place
which had been dug out in the rock for a sepulchre.

<span id="vi.vi.xxv-p12"></span>64. It may also be asked how it is that
Mark says: “And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for
they trembled and were amazed: neither said they anything to any man;
for they were afraid;” <span id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480.md)
whereas Matthew’s statement is in these terms: “And they departed
quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy, and did run to bring
His disciples word. <span id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481.md) The
explanation, however, may be that the women did not venture to tell
either of the angels themselves,—that is, they had not courage enough to
say anything in reply to what they had heard from the angels. Or,
indeed, it may be that they were not bold enough to speak to the guards
whom they saw lying there; for the joy which Matthew mentions is not
inconsistent with the fear of which Mark takes notice. Indeed, we ought
to have supposed that both feelings had possession of their minds, even
although Matthew himself had said nothing about the fear. But now, when
this evangelist also particularizes it, saying, “They departed quickly
from the sepulchre with fear and great joy,” he allows nothing to remain
which can occasion any question of difficulty on this subject.

<span id="vi.vi.xxv-p15"></span>65. At the same time, a question, which
is not to be dealt with lightly, does arise here with respect to the
exact hour at which the women came to the sepulchre. For when Matthew
says, “Now, on the evening of the Sabbath, when it was dawning toward
the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to
see the sepulchre,” what are we to make of Mark’s statement, which runs
thus: “And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they
came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun”? <span
id="fr_1482"></span>[1483](#fn_1482.md) It is to be observed that in this
Mark states nothing inconsistent with the reports given by other two of
the evangelists, namely, Luke and John. For when Luke says, “Very early
in the morning,” and when John puts it thus, “Early, when it was yet
dark,” they convey the same sense which Mark is understood to express
when he says, “Very early, at the rising of the sun;” that is to say,
they all refer to the period when the heavens were now beginning to
brighten in the east, which, of course, does not take place but when the
sunrise is at hand. For it is the brightness which is diffused by the
rising sun that is familiarly designated by the name of the dawn. <span
id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483.md) Consequently, Mark does not
contradict the other evangelist who uses the phrase, “When it was yet
dark;” for as the day breaks, what remains of the darkness \[of the
night\] passes away just in proportion as the sun continues to rise. And
this phrase, “Very early in the morning,” need not be taken to mean that
the sun itself was actually seen by this time \[blazing\] over the
lands; but it is rather to be taken as like the kind of expression which
we are in the habit of employing when speaking to people to whom we wish
to intimate that something should be done more betimes than usual. For
when we have used the term, “Early in the morning,” <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484.md) if we wish to keep the persons
addressed from supposing that we refer directly to the time when the sun
is already conspicuously visible over earth, we usually add the word
“very,” and say, “very early in the morning,” in order that they may
clearly understand that we allude to the time which is also called the
daybreak. <span id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485.md) At the same time,
it is also customary for men, after the cockcrow has been repeatedly
heard, and when they begin to surmise that the day is now approaching,
to say, “It is now early in the morning;” <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) and when after this they weigh
their words and observe that, as the sun now rises,—that is to say, as
it now makes its immediate advent into these parts,—the sky is just
beginning to redden, or to brighten, those who said, “It is early in the
morning,” then amplify their expression and say, “It is very early in
the morning.” But what does it matter, provided only that, whichever
method of explanation be preferred, we understand that what is meant by
Mark, when he uses the terms “early in the morning,” <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487.md) is just the same as is intended by
Luke when he adopts the phrase, “in the morning;” <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488.md) and that the whole expression
employed by the former—namely, “very early in the morning” <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md) —amounts to the same as that which
we find in Luke—namely, “very early in the dawn,” <span
id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) —and as that which is chosen by
John <span id="page_210">p. 210</span> <span
id="vi.vi.xxv-Page_210"></span>when he says, “early, when it was yet
dark”? <span id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) Moreover, when Mark
speaks of the “rising of the sun,” he just means that by its rising the
sun was now beginning to bring the light in upon the sky. But the
question now is this: how can Matthew be in harmony with these three
when he says neither “in the early morning” nor “early in the morning,”
but “in the evening of the Sabbath, when it was beginning to dawn toward
the first day of the week”? This is a matter which must be carefully
investigated.  <span id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) Now, under
that first part of the night, which is \[here called\] the evening,
Matthew intended to refer to this particular night, at the close of
which the women came to the sepulchre. And we understand his reason for
so referring to the said night to have been this: that by the time of
the evening it was lawful for them to bring the spices, because the
Sabbath was then indeed over. Consequently, as they were hindered by the
Sabbath from doing so previously, he has given a designation of the
night, taken from the time at which it began to be a lawful thing for
them to do what they did at any period of the same night which pleased
them. Thus, therefore, the phrase “in the evening of the Sabbath” is
used, as if what was said had been “in the night of the Sabbath,” or in
other words, in the night which follows the day of the Sabbath. The
express words which he employs thus indicate this with sufficient
clearness. For his terms are these: “Now, in the evening of the Sabbath,
when it began to dawn toward the first day of the week;” and that could
not be the case if what we had to understand to be denoted by the
mention of the “evening” was simply the first short space of the night,
or in other words, only the beginning of the night. For what can be said
“to begin to dawn toward the first day of the week” is not explicitly
the beginning \[of the night\], but the night itself, as it commences to
be brought to its close by the advance of the light. For the terminus of
the first part of the night is just the beginning of the second part,
but the terminus of the whole night is the light. Hence we could not
speak of the evening as dawning toward the first day of the week unless
under the term “evening” we should understand the night itself to be
meant, which, as a whole, is brought to its close by the light. It is
also a familiar method of speech in divine Scripture to express the
whole under the part; and thus, under the word “evening” here, the
evangelist has denoted the whole night, which finds its extreme point in
the dawn. <span id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) For it was in the
dawn that those women came to the sepulchre; and in this way they really
came on the night, which is here indicated by the term “evening.” For,
as I have said, the night as a whole is denoted by that word;
consequently, at whatever period of that night they might have come,
they certainly did come in the said night. And, accordingly, if they
came at the latest point in that night, it is still unquestionably the
case that they did come in the said night. But it could not be said to
be on “the evening, when it began to dawn toward the first day of the
week,” unless the night as a whole can be understood under that
expression. Accordingly, the women who came in the night referred to,
came in the evening specified. And if they came at any period, even the
latest during that night, they surely came in the night itself.

<span id="vi.vi.xxv-p28"></span>66. For the space of three days, which
elapsed between the Lord’s death and resurrection, cannot be correctly
understood except in the light of that form of expression according to
which the part is dealt with as the whole. <span
id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) For He said Himself, “For as Jonas
was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly, so shall the Son
of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” <span
id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md) Now, in whichever way we reckon the
times, whether from the point when He yielded up the ghost, or from the
date of his burial, the sum does not come out clearly, unless we take
the intermediate day, that is to say, the Sabbath, as a complete day—in
other words, a full day along with its night,—and, on the other hand,
understand those days between which that one intervenes—that is to say,
the day of the preparation and the first day of the week, which we
designate the Lord’s day—to be dealt with on the principle of the part
standing for the whole. For of what avail is it that some, hard pressed
by these difficulties, and not knowing the very large part which the
mode of expression referred to—namely, that which takes the part as the
whole—plays in the matter of solving the problems presented in the Holy
Scriptures, have struck out the idea of reckoning as a distinct night
those three hours, namely, from the sixth hour to the ninth, during
which the sun was darkened, and as a distinct day the other three hours,
during which the sun was restored again to the lands, that is to say,
from the ninth hour on to its setting? For the night connected with the
coming Sabbath follows, and if we compute it along with its day, there
will then be two days and two nights. But, further, after the Sabbath
there comes in the night connected with the first day of the week, that
is to say, with the <span id="page_211">p. 211</span> <span
id="vi.vi.xxv-Page_211"></span>dawning of the Lord’s day, which was the
time when the Lord arose. Consequently, the result to which this mode of
calculation leads us will be just two days and two nights, and one
night, even supposing it possible to take the last as a complete night,
and taking it for granted that we were not to show that the said dawn
was in reality the ultimate portion of the same. Thus it would appear
that, even although we were to compute these six hours in that fashion,
during three of which the sun was darkened, and during the other three
of which it shone forth again, we would not establish a satisfactory
reckoning of three days and three nights. In accordance, therefore, with
the usage which meets us so frequently in the language of the
Scriptures, and which deals with the part as the whole, it remains for
us to hold the time of the preparation to constitute the day at the one
extremity, <span id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md) on which the Lord
was crucified and buried, and, from that limit, to find one whole day
along with its night which was fully spent. In this way, too, we must
take the intermediate member, that is to say the day of the Sabbath, not
as calculated simply from the part, but as a really complete day. The
third day, again, must be computed from its first part; that is to say,
calculating from the night, we must look upon it as making up a whole
day when its day-portion is connected with it. Thus we shall get a space
of three days, on the analogy of a case already considered, namely,
those eight days after which the Lord went up into a mountain; with
respect to which period we find that Matthew and Mark, fixing their
attention simply on the complete days intervening, have put it thus,
“After six days,” whereas Luke’s representation of the same is this, “An
eight days after.” <span id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md)

<span id="vi.vi.xxv-p33"></span>67. Let us now proceed, therefore, to
look into the rest of this passage, and see how in other respects these
statements are quite consistent with what is given by Matthew. For Luke
tells us, with the utmost plainness, that two angels were seen by those
women who came to the sepulchre. One of these angels we have understood
to be referred to by each of the first two evangelists; that is to say,
one of them is noticed by Matthew, namely, the one who was sitting
outside upon the stone, and a second by Mark, namely, the one who was
sitting within the sepulchre on the right side. But Luke’s version of
the scene is to the following effect: “And that day was the preparation,
and the Sabbath drew on. And the women which had come with Him from
Galilee beheld the sepulchre, and how His body was laid. And they
returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath-day,
according to the commandment. <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md)
Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came
unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared. <span
id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md) And they found the stone rolled
away from the sepulchre. And they entered in, and found not the body of
the Lord Jesus. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed
thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments; and as
they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said
unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is
risen: remember how He spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee,
saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men,
and be crucified, and the third day rise again. And they remembered His
words. And they returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things
unto the eleven, and to all the rest.” <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md) The question, therefore, is this,
how can these angels have been seen sitting each one separately,—namely,
one outside upon the stone, according to Matthew, and another within
upon the right side, according to Mark,—if Luke’s report of the same
bears that the two stood beside those women, although the words ascribed
to them are similar? Well, it is still possible for us to suppose that
one angel was seen by the women in the position assigned by Matthew, and
in the circumstances indicated by Mark, as we have already explained. In
this way, we may understand the said women to have entered into the
sepulchre, that is to say, into a certain space which had been fenced
off within a kind of enclosure, in such a manner that an entrance might
be said to be made when they came in front of the rocky place in which
the sepulchre was constructed; and there we may take them to have beheld
the angel sitting upon the stone which had been rolled away from the
tomb, as Matthew tells us, or in other words, the angel sitting on the
right side, as Mark expresses it. <span
id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md) And then we may further surmise
that the said women, after they had gone within, and when they were
looking at the place where the body of the Lord lay, saw other two
angels standing, as Luke informs us, by whom they were addressed in
similar terms, with a view to animate their minds and edify their
faith. <span id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502.md)

<span id="vi.vi.xxv-p39"></span>68. But let us also examine John’s
version, and see whether or in what manner its consistency with these
others is apparent. John, then, <span id="page_212">p. 212</span> <span
id="vi.vi.xxv-Page_212"></span>narrates these incidents as follows: “Now
the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet
dark, unto the sepulchre, and saw the stone taken away from the
sepulchre. Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other
disciples whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away
the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid Him.
Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and they came to
the sepulchre. So they ran both together: and the other disciple did
outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. And he, stooping down,
saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. Then cometh Simon Peter
following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes
lie, and the napkin, that was about His head, not lying with the linen
clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. Then went in also
that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and
believed. For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that He must rise
again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own
home. But Mary stood without at the <span id="page_213">p. 213</span>
<span id="vi.vi.xxv-Page_213"></span>sepulchre weeping: and, as she
wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, and seeth two
angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet,
where the body of Jesus had lain. They say unto her, Woman, why weepest
thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I
know not where they have laid Him. And when she had thus said, she
turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was
Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?
She, supposing Him to be the gardener, saith unto Him, Sir, if thou have
borne Him hence, tell me where thou hast laid Him, and I will take Him
away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto
Him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me
not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and
say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God,
and your God. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had
seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her.” <span
id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503.md) In the narrative thus given by
John, the statement of the day or time when the sepulchre was come to
agrees with the accounts presented by the rest. Again, in the report of
two angels who were seen, he is also at one with Luke. But when we
observe how the one evangelist tells us that these angels were seen
standing, while the other says that they were sitting; when we notice,
also, that there are certain other things which are left unrecorded by
these two writers; and, further, when we consider how questions are thus
raised regarding the possibility of proving the consistency of the one
set of historians with the other on these subjects, and of fixing the
order in which those said things took place, we see that, unless we
submit the whole to a careful examination, there may easily appear to be
contradictions here between the several narratives.

<span id="vi.vi.xxv-p41"></span>69. This being the case, therefore, let
us, so far as the Lord may help us, take all these incidents, which took
place about the time of the Lord’s resurrection, as they are brought
before us in the statements of all the evangelists together, and let us
arrange them in one connected narrative, which will exhibit them
precisely as they may have actually occurred. It was in the early
morning of the first day of the week, as all the evangelists are at one
in attesting, that the women came to the sepulchre. By that time, all
that is recorded by Matthew alone had already taken place; that is to
say, in regard to the quaking of the earth, and the rolling away of the
stone, and the terror of the guards, with which they were so stricken,
that in some part they lay like dead men. Then, as John informs us, came
Mary Magdalene, who unquestionably was surpassingly more ardent in her
love than these other women <span id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md)
who had ministered to the Lord; so that it was not unreasonable in John
to make mention of her alone, leaving those others unnamed, who,
however, were along with her, as we gather from the reports given by
others of the evangelists. She came accordingly; and when she saw the
stone taken away from the sepulchre, without pausing to make any more
minute investigation, and never doubting but that the body of Jesus had
been removed from the tomb, she ran, as the same John states, and told
the state of matters to Peter and to John himself. For John is himself
that disciple whom Jesus loved. They then set out running to the
sepulchre; and John, reaching the spot first, stooped down and saw the
linen clothes lying, but he did not go within. But Peter followed up,
and went into the sepulchre, and saw the linen clothes lie, and the
napkin, which had been about His head, not lying with the linen clothes,
but wrapped together in a place by itself. Then John entered also, and
saw in like manner, and believed what Mary had told him, namely, that
the Lord had been taken away from the sepulchre. “For as yet they knew
not the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. Then the
disciples went away again unto their own home. But Mary stood without at
the sepulchre weeping,” <span id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md) —that
is to say, before the place in the rock in which the sepulchre was
constructed, but at the same time within that space into which they had
now entered; for there was a garden there, as the same John
mentions. <span id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md) Then they saw the
angel sitting on the right side, upon the stone which was rolled away
from the sepulchre; of which angel both Matthew and Mark discourse.
“Then he said unto them, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus,
which was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come,
see the place where the Lord lay: and go quickly, and tell His disciples
that He is risen from the dead; and, behold, He goeth before you into
Galilee; there shall ye see Him: lo, I have told you.” <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md) In Mark we also find a passage
similar in tenor to the above. At these words, Mary, still weeping, bent
down and looked forwards into the sepulchre, and beheld the two angels,
who are introduced to us in John’s narrative, sitting in white raiment,
one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had
been deposited. “They say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith
unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where
they have laid Him.” <span id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md) Here we
are to suppose the angels to have risen up, so that they could be seen
standing, as Luke states that they were seen, and then, according to the
narrative of the same Luke, to have addressed the women, as they were
afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth. The terms were these:
“Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen:
remember how He spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee, saying, The
Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be
crucified, and the third day rise. And they remembered His words.” <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) It was after this that, as we learn
from John, “Mary turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew
not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou?
whom seekest thou? She, supposing Him to be the gardener, saith unto
Him, Sir, if thou have borne Him hence, tell me where thou hast laid
Him, and I will take Him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned
herself, and saith unto Him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus
saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father:
but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and
your Father; and to my God, and your God.” <span
id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md) Then she departed from the
sepulchre, that is to say, from the ground where there was space for the
garden in front of the stone which had been dug out. Along with her
there were also those other women, who, as Mark tells us, were surprised
with fear and trembling. And they told nothing to any one. At this point
we next take up what Matthew has recorded in the following passage:
“Behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail! And they came and held Him by
the feet, and worshipped Him.” <span
id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md) For thus we gather that, on coming
to the sepulchre, they were twice addressed by the angels; and, again,
that they were also twice addressed by the Lord Himself, namely, at the
point at which Mary took Him to be the gardener, and a second time at
present, when He meets them on the way, with a view to strengthen them
by such a repetition, and to bring them out of their state of fear.
“Then, accordingly, said He unto them, Be not afraid: go, tell my
brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.” <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) “Then came Mary Magdalene, and told
the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these
things unto her;” <span id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md) —not
herself alone, however, but with her also those other women to whom Luke
alludes when he says, “Which told these things unto the eleven
disciples, and all the rest. And their words seemed to them like
madness, and they believed them not.” <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md) Mark also attests these facts; for,
after telling us how the women went out from the sepulchre, trembling
and amazed, and said nothing to any man, he subjoins the statement, that
the Lord rose early the first day of the week, and appeared first to
Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils, and that she went
and told them who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept, and that
they, when they heard that He was alive, and had been seen of her,
believed not.  <span id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) It is further
to be observed, that Matthew has also introduced a notice to the effect
that, as the women who had seen and heard all these things were going
away, there came likewise into the city some of the guards who had been
lying like dead men, and that these persons reported to the chief
priests all the things that were done, that is to say, those of them
which they were themselves also in a position to observe. He tells us,
moreover, that when they were assembled with the elders and had taken
counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, and bade them say that
His disciples came and stole Him away while they slept, promising at the
same time to secure them against the governor, who had given those
guards. Finally, he adds that they took the money, and did as they had
been taught, and that this saying is commonly reported among the Jews
until this day. <span id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md)
