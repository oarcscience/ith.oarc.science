<span id="vii.xlvii-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Sermon XLV.</span>

<span id="vii.xlvii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.xlvii-p2.1"></span>\[XCV. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.xlvii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xlvii-p3.1"></span>*[Mark viii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#005.md)<span id="vii.xlvii-p3.2"></span>,
etc., where the miracle of the seven loaves is related.*

<span id="vii.xlvii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xlvii-p4.1"></span>In</span> expounding to you the Holy
Scriptures, I as it were break bread for you. Do ye in hunger receive
it, and break <span id="fr_3134"></span>[3135](#fn_3134.md) forth with a
fulness of phrase from the heart; and ye who are rich in your banquet,
be not meagre in good works and deeds. What I deal out to you is not
mine own. What ye eat, I eat; what ye live upon, I live upon. We have in
heaven a common store-house; for from thence comes the Word of God.

<span id="vii.xlvii-p6"></span>2. The “seven loaves” <span
id="fr_3135"></span>[3136](#fn_3135.md) signify the seven-fold operation of
the Holy Spirit; the “four thousand men,” the Church established on the
four Gospels; “the seven baskets of fragments,” the perfection of the
Church. For by this number very constantly is perfection figured. For
whence is that which is said, “seven times in a day will I praise
thee”? <span id="fr_3136"></span>[3137](#fn_3136.md) Does a man sin who
does not praise the Lord so often? What then is “seven times will I
praise,” but “I will never cease from praise”? For he who says “seven
times,” signifies all time. Whence in this world there are continual
revolutions of seven days. What then is “seven times in a day will I
praise Thee,” but what is said in another place, “His praise shall
always be in my mouth”? <span id="fr_3137"></span>[3138](#fn_3137.md) With
reference to this perfection, John writes to seven Churches. The
Apocalypse is a book of St. John the Evangelist; and he writes “to seven
Churches.” <span id="fr_3138"></span>[3139](#fn_3138.md) Be ye
hungered; <span id="fr_3139"></span>[3140](#fn_3139.md) own ye these
baskets. For those fragments were not lost; but seeing that ye too
belong to the Church, they have surely profited you. In that I explain
this to you, I minister to Christ; and when ye hear peaceably, ye “sit
down.” <span id="fr_3140"></span>[3141](#fn_3140.md) I in my body sit, but
in my heart I am standing, and ministering to you in anxiety; lest
peradventure, not the food, but the vessel offend any of you. Ye know
the feast of God, ye have often heard it, that it is for the heart, not
for the belly.

<span id="vii.xlvii-p13"></span>3. Of a truth four thousand men were
filled by seven loaves; what is more wonderful than this! Yet even this
were not enough, had not seven baskets also been filled with the
fragments that remained. O great mysteries! they were works, and the
works spake. If thou understand these doings, they are words. And ye too
belong to the four thousand, because ye live under the fourfold Gospel.
To this number the children and women did not belong. For so it is said,
“And they that did eat were four thousand men, excepting women and
children.” <span id="fr_3141"></span>[3142](#fn_3141.md) As though the void
of understanding, and the effeminate were without number. Yet let even
these eat. Let them eat: it may be the children will grow, and will be
children no more; it may be the effeminate will be amended, and become
chaste. Let them eat; we dispense, we deal out to them. But who these
are, God inspecteth His feast, and if they do not amend themselves, He
who knew how to invite them thither, knoweth also how to separate them
from the rest.

<span id="vii.xlvii-p15"></span>4. Ye know it, dearly Beloved; call to
mind the parable of the Gospel, how that the Lord came in to inspect the
guests at a certain feast of His. The Master of the house who had
invited them, as it is written, “found there a man which had not on a
wedding garment.” <span id="fr_3142"></span>[3143](#fn_3142.md) For to the
marriage had that Bridegroom invited them who is “fair in beauty above
the children of men.” That Bridegroom became deformed because of His
deformed spouse, that he might make her fair. How did the Fair One
become deformed? If I do not prove it, I am blaspheming. The testimony
of his fair beauty the Prophet gives me, who saith, “Thou art fair in
beauty above the children of men.” <span
id="fr_3143"></span>[3144](#fn_3143.md) The testimony of his deformity
another Prophet gives me, who saith, “We saw Him, and He had no grace,
nor beauty; but His countenance was <span id="page_407">p. 407</span>
<span id="vii.xlvii-Page_407"></span>marred, and His whole look <span
id="fr_3144"></span>[3145](#fn_3144.md) deformed.” <span
id="fr_3145"></span>[3146](#fn_3145.md) O Prophet, who saidst, “Thou art
fair in beauty above the children of men;” thou art contradicted;
another Prophet cometh out against thee, and saith, “Thou speakest
falsely. We have seen Him. What is this that thou sayest, ‘Thou art fair
in beauty above the children of men? We have seen Him, and He had no
grace nor beauty.’” Are then these two Prophets at disagreement in the
Corner-stone of peace? Both spake of Christ, both spake of the
Cornerstone. In the corner the walls unite. If they do not unite, it is
not a building, but a ruin. No, the Prophets agree, let us not leave
them in strife. Yea, rather let us understand their peace; for they know
not how to strive. O Prophet, who saidst, “Thou art fair in beauty above
the children of men;” where didst thou see Him? Answer me, answer where
didst thou see Him? “Being in the form of God, He thought it not robbery
to be equal with God.” <span id="fr_3146"></span>[3147](#fn_3146.md) There
I saw Him. Dost thou doubt that He who is “equal with God” is “fair in
beauty above the children of men”? Thou hast answered; now let him
answer who said, “We saw Him, and He had no grace, nor beauty.” Thou
hast said so; tell us where didst thou see Him? He begins from the
other’s words; where the other ended, there he begins. Where did he end?
“Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with
God.” Lo, where he saw Him who was “fair in beauty above the children of
men;” do thou tell us,where thou sawest that “He had no grace nor
beauty. But He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made
in the likeness of men, and found in fashion as a man.” <span
id="fr_3147"></span>[3148](#fn_3147.md) Of His deformity he still further
says; “He humbled Himself, having become obedient unto death even the
death of the cross.” Lo, where I saw Him. Therefore are they both in
peaceful concord, both are at peace together. What is more “fair” than
God? What more “deformed” than the Crucified?

<span id="vii.xlvii-p22"></span>5. So then this Bridegroom, “fair in
beauty above the children of men,” became deformed that He might make
His Spouse fair to whom it is said, “O thou beauteous among
women,” <span id="fr_3148"></span>[3149](#fn_3148.md) of whom it is said,
“Who is this that cometh up, whitened” <span
id="fr_3149"></span>[3150](#fn_3149.md) with the brightness of light, not
the colouring of falsehood! He then who called them to the wedding,
found a man who had not a wedding garment, and He said unto him,
“Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment? And he
was speechless.” For he found not what to answer. And the Master of the
house Who had invited him said, “Bind him hands and feet, and cast him
into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
 <span id="fr_3150"></span>[3151](#fn_3150.md) For so small a fault, so
great a punishment? For great it is. It is called a small fault not to
have “the wedding garment;” small, but only by those who do not
understand. How would He have been so incensed, how would He have so
judged, to cast him, on account of the wedding garment which he had not,
“bound hands and feet into outer darkness, where was weeping and
gnashing of teeth,” unless it had been a very grievous fault, not to
have “the wedding garment”? I say this; seeing ye have been invited
through me; for though He invited you, He invited you by my ministry. Ye
are all at the feast, have the wedding garment. I will explain what it
is, that ye may all have it, and if any one now hears me who has it not,
let him, before the Master of the house comes and inspects His guests,
be changed for the better, let him receive “the wedding garment,” and so
sit down in all assurance.

<span id="vii.xlvii-p26"></span>6. For in truth, dearly Beloved, he who
was cast forth from the feast, does not signify one man; far from it.
They are many. And the Lord Himself who put forth this parable, the
Bridegroom Himself, who calleth together to the feast, and quickeneth
whom He calleth, He hath Himself explained to us, that that man does not
denote one man, but many, there, in that very place, in the same
parable. I do not go far for this, I find the explanation there, there I
break the bread, and set it before you to be eaten. For He said, when he
who had not “the wedding garment was cast out thence into outer
darkness,” He said and added immediately, “for many are called, but few
chosen.” <span id="fr_3151"></span>[3152](#fn_3151.md) Thou hast cast forth
one man from hence, and Thou sayest, “for many are called, but few
chosen.” Without doubt the chosen are not cast forth; and they were the
few guests who remained; and the “many” were represented in that one,
because that one who hath not “the wedding garment” is the body of the
wicked.

<span id="vii.xlvii-p28"></span>7. What is “the wedding garment”? Let us
search for it in the Holy Scriptures. What is “the wedding garment”?
Without doubt it is something which the bad and good have not in common;
let us discover this, and we shall discover “the wedding garment.” Among
the gifts of God, what have not the good and bad in common? <span
id="fr_3152"></span>[3153](#fn_3152.md) That we are men and not beasts, is
a gift of God; but this is common to good <span id="page_408">p.
408</span> <span id="vii.xlvii-Page_408"></span>and bad. That the light
from heaven rises upon us, that the rain descends from the cloud, the
fountains flow, the fields yield their fruit; these are gifts, but
common to the good and bad. Let us go to the marriage feast, let us
leave the others without, who being called come not. Let us consider the
guests themselves, that is, Christians. Baptism is a gift of God, the
good and bad have it. The Sacraments of the Altar the good and bad
receive together. Saul prophesied for all his wickedness, and in his
rage against a holy and most righteous man, even while he was
persecuting him, he prophesied. Are the good only said to believe? “The
devils also believe and tremble.” <span
id="fr_3153"></span>[3154](#fn_3153.md) What shall I do? I have sifted all,
and have not yet come to “the wedding garment.” I have unfolded my
envelopings, I have considered all, or almost all, and have not yet come
to that garment. The Apostle Paul in a certain place has brought me a
great collection <span id="fr_3154"></span>[3155](#fn_3154.md) of excellent
things; he has laid them open before me, and I have said to him, “Show
me, if so be thou hast found among them that ‘wedding garment.’” He
begins to unfold them one by one, and to say, “Though I speak with the
tongues of men and of Angels, though I have all knowledge, and the gift
of prophecy, and all faith, so that I could remove mountains; though I
distribute all my goods to the poor, and give my body to be
burned.” <span id="fr_3155"></span>[3156](#fn_3155.md) Precious garments!
nevertheless, there is not yet here that “wedding garment.” Now bring
out to us “the wedding garment.” Why dost thou keep us in suspense, O
Apostle? Peradventure prophecy is a gift of God which both good and bad
have not. “If,” says He, “I have not charity, nothing profiteth me.” See
“the wedding garment;” put it on, ye guests, that ye may sit down
securely. Do not say; “we are too poor to have that garment.” Clothe
others, and ye are clothed yourselves. It is winter, clothe the naked.
Christ is naked; and He will give you that “wedding garment” whosoever
have it not. Run to Him, beseech Him; He knoweth how to sanctify His
faithful ones, He knoweth how to clothe His naked ones. That ye may be
able as having “the wedding garment” to be free from the fear of the
outer darkness, and the binding of your members and hands and feet; let
not your works fail. If they fail, with hands bound what canst thou do?
with feet bound, whither wilt thou fly? Keep then that “wedding
garment,” put it on, and so sit down in security, when He comes to
inspect. The Day of Judgment will come; He is now giving a long space,
let him who erewhile was naked now be clothed.
