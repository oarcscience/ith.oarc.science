id="vi.v.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LX.—Of His Paying the Tribute Money
Out of the Mouth of the Fish, an Incident Which Matthew Alone
Mentions.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxi-p2"></span>118. Matthew continues in these terms:
<span id="page_155">p. 155</span> <span
id="vi.v.lxi-Page_155"></span>“And when they were come to Capharnaum,
they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said to him, Doth
not your master pay tribute? He saith, Yes;” and so on, down to where we
read: “Thou shall find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them
for me and thee.” <span id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106.md) He is the
only one who relates this occurrence, after the interposition of which
he follows again the order which is pursued also by Mark and Luke in
company with him.
