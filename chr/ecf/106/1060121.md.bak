<span id="vi.v.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Of the Lord’s Crossing the Lake
on that Occasion on Which He Slept in the Vessel, and of the Casting Out
of Those Devils Whom He Suffered to Go into the Swine; And of the
Consistency of the Accounts Given by Matthew, Mark, and Luke of All that
Was Done and Said on These Occasions.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxv-p2"></span>55. “And when He was entered into a ship,
His disciples followed Him. And, behold, there arose a great tempest in
the sea.” And so the story goes on, until we come to the words, “And He
came into His own city.” <span id="fr_891"></span>[892](#fn_891.md) Those
two narratives which are told by Matthew in continuous
succession,—namely, that regarding the calm upon the sea after Jesus was
roused from His sleep and had commanded the winds, and that concerning
the persons who were possessed with the fierce devil, and who brake
their bands and were driven into the wilderness,—are given also in like
manner by Mark and Luke. <span id="fr_892"></span>[893](#fn_892.md) Some
parts of these stories are expressed, indeed, in different terms by the
different writers, but the sense remains the same. This is the case, for
example, when Matthew represents the Lord to have said, “Why are ye
fearful, O ye of little faith?” <span id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893.md)
while Mark’s version is, “Why are ye fearful? Is it that ye have no
faith?” <span id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894.md) For Mark’s word refers
to that perfect faith which is like a grain of mustard seed; and so he,
too, speaks in effect of the “little faith.” Luke, again, puts it thus:
“Where is your faith?” <span id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895.md)
Accordingly, the whole utterance may perhaps have gone thus: “Why are ye
fearful? Where is your faith, O ye of little faith?” And so one of them
records one part, and another another part, of the entire saying. The
same may be the case with the words spoken by the disciples when they
awoke Him. Matthew gives us: “Lord, save us: we perish.” <span
id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896.md) Mark has: “Master, carest Thou not
that we perish?” <span id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897.md) And Luke says
simply, “Master, we perish.” <span id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898.md)
These different expressions, however, convey one and the same meaning on
the part of those who were awaking the Lord, and who were wishful to
secure their safety. Neither need we inquire which of these several
forms is to be preferred as the one actually addressed to Christ. For
whether they really used the one or the other of these three
phraseologies, or expressed themselves in different words, which are
unrecorded by any one of the evangelists, but which were equally well
adapted to give the like representation of what was meant, what
difference does it make in the fact itself? At the same time, it may
also possibly have been the case that, when several parties in concert
were trying to awake Him, all these various modes of expression had been
used, one by one person, and another by another. In the same way, too,
we may deal with the exclamation on the stilling of the tempest, which,
according to Matthew, was, “What manner of man is this, that the winds
and the sea obey Him?” <span id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899.md) according
to Mark, “What man, thinkest thou, is this, <span
id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900.md) that both the wind <span
id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span id="vi.v.xxv-Page_130"></span>and the
sea obey Him?” <span id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901.md) and according to
Luke, “What man, thinkest thou, is this? <span
id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902.md) for He commandeth both the winds and
the sea, <span id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903.md) and they obey Him.” Who
can fail to see that the sense in all these forms is quite identical?
For the expression, “What man, thinkest thou, is this?” has precisely
the same import with the other, “What manner of man is this?” <span
id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904.md) And where the words “He commandeth”
are omitted, it can at least be understood as a matter of course that
the obedience is rendered to the person commanding.

<span id="vi.v.xxv-p17"></span>56. Moreover, with respect to the
circumstance that Matthew states that there were two men who were
afflicted with the legion of devils which received permission to go into
the swine, whereas Mark and Luke instance only a single individual, we
may suppose that one of these parties was a person of some kind of
superior notability and repute, whose case was particularly lamented by
that district, and for whose deliverance there was special anxiety. With
the intention of indicating that fact, two of the evangelists have
judged it proper to make mention only of the one person, in connection
with whom the fame of this deed had been spread abroad the more
extensively and remarkably. Neither should any scruple be excited by the
different forms in which the words uttered by the possessed <span
id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905.md) have been reproduced by the various
evangelists. For we may either resolve them all into one and the same
thing, or suppose them all to have been actually spoken. Nor, again,
should we find any difficulty in the circumstance that with Matthew the
address is couched in the plural number, but with Mark and Luke in the
singular. For these latter two tell us at the same time, that when the
man was asked what was his name, he answered that he was Legion, because
the devils were many. Nor, once more, is there any discrepancy between
Mark’s statement that the herd of swine was round about the
mountain, <span id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906.md) and Luke’s, that they
were on the mountain. <span id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907.md) For the
herd of swine was so great that one portion of it might be on the
mountain, and another only round about it. For, as Mark has expressly
informed us, there were about two thousand swine.
