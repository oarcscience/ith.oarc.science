<span id="vi.v.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—Of the Occasion on Which He
Upbraided the Cities Because They Repented Not, Which Incident is
Recorded by Luke as Well as by Matthew; And of the Question Regarding
Matthew’s Harmony with Luke in the Matter of the Order.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxxiii-p2"></span>79. Thereafter Matthew goes on as
follows: “Then began He to upbraid the cities wherein most of His mighty
works were done, because they repented not;” and so on, down to where we
read, “It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom at the day of
judgment, than for you.” <span id="fr_993"></span>[994](#fn_993.md) This
section likewise is given by Luke, who reports it also as an utterence
from the lips of the Lord in connection with a certain continuous <span
id="page_140">p. 140</span> <span
id="vi.v.xxxiii-Page_140"></span>discourse which He delivered. This
circumstance makes it the rather appear that Luke has recorded these
words in the strict consecution in which they were spoken by the Lord,
while Matthew has kept by the order of his own recollections. Or if it
is supposed that Matthew’s words, “Then began He to upbraid the cities,”
must be taken in such a way as to imply that the intention was to
express, by the term “then,” the precise point of time at which the
saying was uttered, and not to signify in a somewhat broader way the
period at which many of these things were done and spoken, then I say
that any one entertaining that idea may equally well believe these
sentences to have been pronounced on two different occasions. For if it
is the fact that even in one and the same evangelist some things are
found which the Lord utters twice over, as is the case with this very
Luke in the instance of the counsel not to take a scrip for the journey,
and so with other things in like manner which we find to have been
spoken by the Lord in two different places, <span
id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994.md) —why should it seem strange if some
other word of the Lord, which was originally uttered on two separate
occasions, may happen also to be recorded by two several evangelists,
each of whom gives it in the order in which it was actually spoken, and
if thus the order seems to be different in the two, simply because the
sentences were uttered both on the occasion noticed by the one, and on
that referred to by the other?
