<span id="vi.iv.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—A Statement in Vindication
of the Doctrine of the Apostles as Opposed to Idolatry, in the Words of
the Prophecies.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxxii-p2"></span> 49. What, then, do these men, who are
at once the perverse applauders of Christ and the slanderers of
Christians, say to these facts? Can it be that Christ, by the use of
magical arts, caused those predictions to be uttered so long ago by the
prophets? or have His disciples invented them? Is it thus that the
Church, in her extension among the Gentile nations, though once barren,
has been made to rejoice now in the possession of more children than
that synagogue had which, in its Law or its King, had received, as it
were, a husband? or is it thus that this Church has been led to enlarge
the place of her tent, and to occupy all nations and tongues, so that
now she lengthens her cords beyond the limits to which the rights of the
empire of Rome extend, yea, even on to the territories of the Persians
and the Indians and other barbarous nations? or that, on the right hand
by means of true Christians, and on the left hand by means of pretended
Christians, His name is being made known among such a multitude of
peoples? or that His seed is made to inherit the Gentiles, so as now to
inhabit cities which had been left desolate of the true worship of God
and the true religion? or that His Church has been so little daunted by
the threats and furies of men, even at times when she has been covered
with the blood of martyrs, like one clad in purple array, that she has
prevailed over persecutors at once so numerous, so violent, and so
powerful? or that she has not been confounded, like one put to shame,
when it was a great crime to be or to become a Christian? or that she is
made to forget her confusion for ever, because, where sin had abounded,
grace did much more abound? <span id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) or
that she is taught not to remember the shame of her widowhood, because
only for a little was she forsaken and subjected to opprobrium, while
now she shines forth once more with such eminent glory? or, in fine, is
it only a fiction concocted by Christ’s disciples, that the Lord who
made her, and brought her forth from the denomination of the devil and
the demons, the very God of Israel is now called the God of the whole
earth; all which, nevertheless, the prophets, whose books are now in the
hands of the enemies of Christ, foretold so long before Christ became
the Son of man?

<span id="vi.iv.xxxii-p4"></span>50. From this, therefore, let them
understand that the matter is not left obscure or doubtful even to the
slowest and dullest minds: from this, I say, let these perverse
applauders of Christ and execrators of the Christian religion understand
that the disciples of Christ have learned and taught, in opposition to
their gods, precisely what the doctrine of Christ contains. For the God
of Israel is found to have enjoined in the books of the prophets that
all these objects which those men are minded to worship should be held
in abomination and be destroyed, while He Himself is now named the God
of the whole earth, through the instrumentality of Christ and the Church
of Christ, exactly as He promised so long time ago. For if, indeed, in
their marvellous folly, they fancy that Christ worshipped their gods,
and that it was only through them that He had power to do things so
great as these, we may well ask whether the God of Israel also
worshipped their gods, who has now fulfilled by Christ what He promised
with respect to the extension of His own worship through all the
nations, and with respect to the detestation and subversion of those
other deities? <span id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) Where are their
gods? Where are the vaticinations of their fanatics, and the divinations
of their prophets? <span id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md) Where are the
auguries, or the auspices, or the soothsayings, <span
id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md) or the oracles of demons? Why is it
that, out of the ancient books which constitute the records of this type
of religion, nothing in the form <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxxii-Page_99"></span>either of admonition or of prediction is
advanced to oppose the Christian faith, or to controvert the truth of
those prophets of ours, who have now come to be so well understood among
all nations? “We have offended our gods,” they say in reply, “and they
have deserted us for that reason: that explains it also why the
Christians have prevailed against us, and why the bliss of human life,
exhausted <span id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md) and impaired, goes to
wreck among us.” We challenge them, however, to take the books of their
own seers, and read out to us any statement purporting that the kind of
issue which has come upon them would be brought on them by the
Christians: nay, we challenge them to recite any passages in which, if
not Christ (for they wish to make Him out to have been a worshipper of
their own gods), at least this God of Israel, who is allowed to be the
subverter of other deities, is held up as a deity destined to be
rejected and worthy of detestation. But never will they produce any such
passage, unless, perchance, it be some fabrication of their own. And if
ever they do cite any such statement, the fact that it is but a fiction
of their own will betray itself in the unnoticeable manner in which a
matter of so grave importance is found adduced; whereas, in good truth,
before what has been predicted should have come to pass, it behoved to
have been proclaimed in the temples of the gods of all nations, with a
view to the timeous preparation and warning of all who are now
minded <span id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md) to be Christians.
