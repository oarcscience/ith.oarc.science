<span id="vi.vi.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.—Of the Method in Which the Four
Evangelists are Shown to Be at One in the Accounts Given of the Lord’s
Supper and the Indication of His Betrayer.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.ii-p2"></span>2. Let us commence here, accordingly, with
the notice presented by Matthew, \[which runs thus\]: “And as they were
eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to
His disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.” <span
id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230) Both Mark and Luke also gave this
section. <span id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231) It is true that Luke
has made mention of the cup twice over: first before He gave the bread;
and, secondly, after the bread has been given. But the fact is, that
what is stated in that earlier connection has been introduced, according
to this writer’s habit, by anticipation, while the words which he has
inserted here in their proper order are left unrecorded in those
previous verses, and the two passages when put together make up exactly
what stands expressed by those other evangelists. <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232) John, on the other hand, has said
nothing about the body and blood of the Lord in this context; but he
plainly certifies that the Lord spake to that effect on another
occasion, <span id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233) with much greater
fulness than here. At present, however, after recording how the Lord
rose from supper and washed the disciples’ feet, and after telling us
also the reason why the Lord dealt thus with them, in expressing which
He had intimated, although still obscurely, and by the use of a
testimony of Scripture, the fact that He was being betrayed by the man
who was to eat of His bread, at this point John comes to the section in
question, which the other three evangelists also unite in introducing.
He presents it thus: “When Jesus had thus said, He was troubled in
spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, That
one of you shall betray me. Then the disciples looked (as the same John
subjoins) one on another, doubting of whom He spake.” <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234) “And (as Matthew and Mark tell us)
they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto
Him, Is it I? And He answered and said (as Matthew proceeds to state),
He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.”
Matthew also goes on to make the following addition to the preceding:
“The Son of man <span id="page_177">p. 177</span> <span
id="vi.vi.ii-Page_177"></span>indeed goeth, as it is written of Him; but
woe unto that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed! it had been
good for that man if he had not been born.” <span
id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235) Mark, too, is at one with him here
as regards both the words themselves and the order of narration. <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236) Then Matthew continues thus: “Then
Judas, which betrayed Him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said
unto him, Thou hast said.” Even these words did not say explicitly
whether he was himself the man. For the sentence still admits of being
understood as if its point was this, “I am not the person who has said
so.” <span id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237) All this, too, may quite
easily have been uttered by Judas and answered by the Lord without its
being noticed by all the others.

<span id="vi.vi.ii-p11"></span>3. After this, Matthew proceeds to insert
the mystery of His body and blood, as it was committed then by the Lord
to the disciples. Here Mark and Luke act correspondingly. But after He
had handed the cup to them, \[we find that\] He spoke again concerning
His betrayer, in terms which Luke recounts, when he says, “But, behold,
the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. And truly the
Son of man goeth as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom He
shall be betrayed.” <span id="fr_1238"></span>[1239](#fn_1238) At this
point we must now suppose that to come in which is narrated by John
while these others omit it, just as John has also passed by certain
matters which they have detailed. In accordance with this, after the
giving of the cup, and after the Lord’s subsequent saying which has been
brought in by Luke,—namely, “But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth
me is with me on the table,” etc.,—the statement made by John is \[to be
taken as immediately\] subjoined. It is to the following effect: “Now
there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus
loved. Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said unto him, <span
id="fr_1239"></span>[1240](#fn_1239) Who is he of whom He speaketh? He
then, when he had laid himself on Jesus’ breast, saith unto Him, Lord,
who is it? Jesus answered, He it is to whom I shall give a sop, when I
have dipped it. And when He had dipped the sop, He gave it to Judas, the
son of Simon \[of\] Scarioth. And after the sop Satan then entered into
him.” <span id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240)

<span id="vi.vi.ii-p15"></span>4. Here we must take care not to let John
underlie the appearance not only of standing in antagonism to Luke, who
had stated before this, that Satan entered into the heart of Judas at
the time when he made his bargain with the Jews to betray Him on receipt
of a sum of money, but also of contradicting himself. For, at an earlier
point, and previous to \[his notice of\] the receiving of this sop, he
had made use of these terms: “And supper being ended, the devil having
now put into the heart of Judas to betray Him.” <span
id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241) And how does he enter into the
heart, but by putting unrighteous persuasions into the thoughts of
unrighteous men? The explanation, however, is this. We ought to suppose
Judas to have been more fully taken possession of by the devil now, just
as on the other hand, in the instance of the good, those who had already
received the Holy Spirit on that occasion, subsequently to His
resurrection, when He breathed upon them and said, “Receive ye the Holy
Ghost,”  <span id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242) also obtained a
fuller gift of that Spirit at a later time, namely, when He was sent
down from above on the day of Pentecost. In like manner, Satan then
entered into this man after the sop. And (as John himself mentions in
the immediate context) “Jesus saith unto him, What thou doest, do
quickly. Now no man at the table knew for what intent He spake this unto
him; for some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus
said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast;
or, that he should give something to the poor. He then, having received
the sop, went immediately out; and it was night. Therefore, when he was
gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is
glorified in Him: and if God be glorified in Him, God shall also glorify
Him in Himself, and shall straightway glorify Him.” <span
