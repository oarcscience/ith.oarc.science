<span id="vii.xci-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.xci-p1.1"></span>Sermon LXXXIX.</span>

<span id="vii.xci-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.xci-p2.1"></span>\[CXXXIX. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.xci-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xci-p3.1"></span>*[John x.
30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md)<span id="vii.xci-p3.2"></span>, “I
and the Father are one.”*

<span id="vii.xci-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xci-p4.1"></span>Ye</span> have heard what the Lord God, Jesus
Christ, the Only Son of God, born of God the Father without any mother,
and born of a Virgin mother without any human father, said, “I and My
Father are One.” <span id="fr_4163"></span>[4164](#fn_4163.md) Receive ye
this, believe it in such wise that ye may attain <span
id="fr_4164"></span>[4165](#fn_4164.md) to understand it. For faith ought
to go before understanding, that understanding may be the reward of
faith. For the Prophet hath said most expressly, “Unless ye believe, ye
shall not understand.” <span id="fr_4165"></span>[4166](#fn_4165.md) What
then is simply preached is to be believed; what is with exactness
discussed, is to be understood. At first then <span
id="fr_4166"></span>[4167](#fn_4166.md) to imbue your minds with faith we
preach to you Christ, the Only Son of God the Father. Why is added, “The
Only Son”? Because He whose Only Son He is, hath many sons by grace. All
the rest then, all saints are sons of God by grace, He Alone by Nature.
They who are sons of God by grace are not What the Father is. And no
saint hath ever dared to say, what that Only Son saith, “I and My Father
are One.” Is He not then our Father too? If He be not our Father, how
say we when we pray, “Our Father, which art in heaven”? <span
id="fr_4167"></span>[4168](#fn_4167.md) But we are sons whom He hath made
sons by His Own will, not begotten as sons of His Own Nature. And in
truth He hath begotten us too, but as it is said, as adopted ones,
begotten by the favour of His adoption, not by Nature. And this too are
we called, for that “God hath called us into the adoption of
sons;” <span id="fr_4168"></span>[4169](#fn_4168.md) we are though adopted,
men. He is called the Only Son, the Only Begotten, in that, He is That
which the Father is; but we are men, The Father is God. In then that He
is That which the Father is; He said, and said truly, “I and My Father
are One.” What is, “are One”? Are of one Nature. What is, “are One”? Are
of one Substance.

<span id="vii.xci-p11"></span>2. Peradventure, ye but imperfectly
understand what “of one Substance” is. Take we pains that ye may
understand it; may God assist both me who speak, and you that hear; me,
that I may speak such things as are true and fit for you; and you, that
before and above all things ye may believe; and then that ye may
understand as best ye can. What then is “of One Substance”? Let me make
use of similitudes to you, that what is imperfectly understood may be
made clear by example. As, suppose, God is gold. His Son is gold also.
If similitudes ought not to be given for heavenly things from things
earthly, how is it written, “Now the Rock was Christ”? <span
id="fr_4169"></span>[4170](#fn_4169.md) So then, Whatsoever the Father is,
This is the Son also; as I have said, for example, “The Father is gold,
the Son is gold.” For he who says, “The Son is not of the Very Substance
which the Father is;” what else says he but, “The Father is gold, the
Son is silver”? If the Father be gold, and the Son silver; the Only Son
hath degenerated from the Father. A man begets a man; of what substance
the father is who begets, of the same substance is the Son who is
begotten. What is, “of the same substance”? The one is a man, and the
other is a man; the one hath a soul; so hath the other a soul; the one
hath a body, so hath the other a body; what one is, that is the other.

<span id="vii.xci-p13"></span>3. But the Arian heresy makes answer, and
says. What says it to me? “Mark what thou hast said”? What have I said?
“That the Son of a man may be compared to the Son of God.” Certainly he
may be compared; but not as you suppose, in strictness of
expression; <span id="fr_4170"></span>[4171](#fn_4170.md) but for a
similitude. But tell me now what you would make of this. “Do you not
see,” says he, “that the father who begets is greater <span
id="fr_4171"></span>[4172](#fn_4171.md) in age, and the son who is begotten
less? How then say ye? tell me; how then say ye, that the Father and the
Son, God and Christ, are equal; when ye see that when a man begets a
son, the son is less, and the father greater?” Thou wise one, in
eternity thou art looking for times; where there are no times, thou art
looking for differences of age! When the father is greater in age, and
the son less, both are in time; the one groweth, for that the other
groweth old. For by nature, the man, the father, did not beget one less,
by nature, as I said, but by age. Wouldest thou know, how that by nature
he did not beget one less? Wait, let him grow, and he will be equal to
his father. For a little boy even by growing attains to his father’s
full size. Whereas <span id="page_528">p. 528</span> <span
id="vii.xci-Page_528"></span>you assert that the Son of God is in such
wise born less, as never to grow, and by growing even to attain to His
Father’s size. Now then a man’s son born of a man, is born in a better
condition than the Son of God. How? Because the former grows, and
attains to his father’s size. But Christ, if it is as ye say, is in such
wise born less, as that He must ever remain less, and no growth of years
at least is to be looked for here. Thus then you say that there is a
diversity in nature. But why say you so, but because you will not
believe the Son to be of the Same Substance which the Father is?
Finally, first acknowledge that He is of the Same Substance, and so call
Him less. Consider the case of a man, he is a man. What is his
substance? He is a man. What is he whom he begets? He is less, but he is
a man. The age is unequal, the nature equal. Do you then say too, “What
the Father is, That is the Son, but the Son is less”? Say so, make a
step forward, say, “of the Same Substance, only less;” and you will get
to His being equal. For it is not a little step you take, it is not a
little approach you make to the truth, of acknowledging Him equal, if
you shall acknowledge Him to be of the Same Substance, though less. “But
He is not of the Same Substance,” this you say. So then in that you say
this, here is gold and silver; what you say is as if a man were to beget
a horse. For a man is of one substance, a horse of another. If then the
Son is of another substance than the Father, the Father hath begotten a
monster. For when a creature, that is a woman, gives birth to anything
that is not a man, it is called a monster. But that it be not a monster,
he that is born is that which he is that begat him, that is, a man and a
man, a horse and a horse, a dove and a dove, a sparrow and a sparrow.

<span id="vii.xci-p16"></span>4. To His creatures hath He given to beget
that which they are. To His creatures, to mortal, earthly creatures,
hath God given, hath granted to beget that which they are; and thinkest
thou that He hath not been able to reserve this for Himself, He who is
before all ages? Should He who hath no beginning of time, beget a son,
different from That which Himself is, beget a degenerate son? Hear ye
how great a blasphemy it is to say, that the Only Son of God is of
another substance. Most certainly if He is so, He is degenerate. If you
should say to any child of man, “Thou art degenerate,” how great an
offence is it! And yet in what sense is any child of man said to be
degenerate? As, for example, his father is brave, he is a poltroon and a
coward. If any one sees him, and would rebuke him, as he thinks of his
brave father, what does he say to him? “Get thee hence, thou degenerate
one!” What is “degenerate one”? “Thy father was a brave man, and thou
tremblest through fear.” He to whom this is said, is degenerate by some
fault, by nature he is equal. What is, “by nature he is equal”? He is a
man, which his father also is. But the one brave, the other a coward;
the one bold, the other timid; yet both men. By some fault then he is
degenerate, not by nature. But when you say, that the Only Son, the One
Son of the Father, is degenerate, you say nought else, but that He is
not What the Father is; and you do not say, that having been already
born, He has become degenerate; but He was begotten so. Who can endure
this blasphemy? If they could in any sort whatever see this blasphemy,
they would fly from it, and become catholics.

<span id="vii.xci-p17"></span>5. But what shall I say, Brethren? Let us
not be angry with them; but pray we for them, that God would give them
understanding; for peradventure they were born so. <span
id="fr_4172"></span>[4173](#fn_4172.md) What is, were born so? They receive
what they hold from their parents. They prefer their birth to the truth.
Let them become what they are not, that they may be able to keep what
they are; that is, let them become catholics, that they may keep their
nature as men; that the creation of God in them perish not, let the
grace of God be added to them. For they imagine that by their outrage of
the Son they honour the Father. When you say to him, “Thou blasphemest;”
he answers, “Why do I blaspheme?” “In that thou sayest that the Son is
not what the Father is.” And he answers me, “Yea, it is thou who
blasphemest.” Why? “Because thou wouldest make the Son equal to the
Father.” “I do wish to make the Son equal with the Father, but is this
to make a stranger equal? The Father rejoiceth when I equal with Him His
Only Son; He rejoiceth because He is not envious. And because God is not
envious of His Only Son, therefore did He beget Him Such as He is
Himself. Thou doest wrong both to the Son, and to the Father Himself,
for whose honour thou wouldest do outrage to the Son. For in truth for
this reason dost thou say that the Son is not of the Same Substance,
lest thou shouldest do wrong to His Father. I will soon show thee, that
thou doest wrong to both.” “How?” saith he. “If I say to any man’s son,
Thou art degenerate, thou art not like thy father; degenerate, thou art
not what thy father is. The son hears it, and is angry, and says, ‘Was I
then born degenerate?’ The father hears it, and is more angry still. And
in his anger what says he? ‘Have I then begotten a degenerate son? If I
then be one thing, and I have begotten another, I have begotten a
monster.’ What is it then, that whereas thou wishest to pay honour to
the One by doing outrage to <span id="page_529">p. 529</span> <span
id="vii.xci-Page_529"></span>the Other, thou doest outrage to Both? Thou
offendest the Son, but thou wilt not propitiate the Father. When thou
honourest the Father by outraging the Son, thou offendest both the Son
and the Father. From whom wilt thou fly? to whom wilt thou fly? When the
Father is angry with thee, dost thou fly to the Son? What doth He say to
thee? ‘To whom dost thou fly, to Me, whom thou hast made degenerate?’
When the Son is offended, dost thou run to the Father? He too saith to
thee; ‘To whom dost thou fly, to Me who, thou hast said, have begotten a
degenerate Son?’” Let this suffice for you; hold it fast, commit it to
memory, inscribe it in your faith. But that ye may understand it, pour
out your prayers to God, the Father and the Son, who are One.
