<span id="vi.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Of the Question Why God
Suffered the Jews to Be Reduced to Subjection.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii-p2"></span>20. Hence also they cannot meet us
fairly with this question: Why, then, did the God of the Hebrews, whom
you declare to be the supreme and true God, not only not subdue the
Romans under their power, but even fail to secure those Hebrews
themselves against subjugation by the Romans? For there were open sins
of theirs that went before them, and on account of which the prophets so
long time ago predicted that this very thing would overtake them; and
above all, the reason lay in the fact, that in their impious fury they
put Christ to death, in the commission of which sin they were made blind
\[to the guilt of their crime\] through the deserts of other hidden
transgressions. That His sufferings also would be for the benefit of the
Gentiles, was foretold by the same prophetic testimony. Nor, in another
point of view, did the fact appear clearer, that the kingdom of that
nation, and its temple, and its priesthood, and its sacrificial system,
and that mystical unction which is called <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xiii-p2.1"></span> χρῖσμα</span> <span
id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md) in Greek, from which the name of
*Christ* takes its evident application, and on account of which that
nation was accustomed to speak of its kings as anointed ones, <span
id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) were ordained with the express object
of prefiguring Christ, than has the kindred fact become apparent, that
after the resurrection of the Christ who was put to death began to be
preached unto the believing Gentiles, all those things came to their
end, all unrecognised as the circumstance was, whether by the Romans,
through whose victory, or by the Jews, through whose subjugation, it was
brought about that they did thus reach their conclusion.
