<span id="vi.v.lvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LV.—Of the Harmony Between the Three
Evangelists in the Notices Which They Subjoin of the Manner in Which the
Lord Charged the Man to Follow Him Who Wished to Come After Him.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lvi-p2"></span>111. Matthew continues thus: “Then said
Jesus unto His disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross, and follow me;” and so on, down to the
words, “And then He shall reward every man according to his work.” <span
id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093.md) This is appended also by Mark, who
keeps the same order. But he does not say of the Son of man, who was to
come with His angels, that He is to reward every man according to his
work. Nevertheless, he mentions at the same time that the Lord spoke to
this effect: “Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my words in this
adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of man be
ashamed when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.”
 <span id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094.md) And this may be taken to
bear the same sense as is expressed by Matthew, when he says, that “He
shall reward every man according to his work.” Luke <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095.md) also adds the same statements in
the same order, slightly varying the terms indeed in which they are
conveyed, but still showing a complete parallel with the others in
regard to the truthful reproduction of the self-same ideas. <span
