<span id="v.ii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.</span>

<span id="v.ii.ix-p2"></span>21. “For I say unto you, that except your
righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and
Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven;” <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) *i.e.*, unless ye shall fulfil not only
those least precepts of the law which begin the man, but also those
which are added by me, who am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil
it, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. But you say to me:
If, when He was speaking above of those least commandments, He said that
whosoever shall break one of them, and shall teach in accordance with
his transgression, is called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but
that whosoever shall do them, and shall teach \[men\] so, is called
great, and hence will be already in the kingdom of heaven, because he is
great: what need is there for additions to the least precepts of the
law, if he can be already in the kingdom of heaven, because whosoever
shall do them, and shall so teach, is great? For this reason that
sentence is to be understood thus: “But whosoever shall do and teach men
so, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven,”—*i.e.* not
in accordance with those least commandments, but in accordance with
those which I am about to mention. Now what are they? “That your
righteousness,” says He, “may exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees;”
for unless it shall exceed theirs, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
of heaven. Whosoever, there<span id="page_11">p. 11</span> <span
id="v.ii.ix-Page_11"></span>fore, shall break those least commandments,
and shall teach men so, shall be called the least; but whosoever shall
do those least commandments, and shall teach men so, is not necessarily
to be reckoned great and meet for the kingdom of heaven; but yet he is
not so much the least as the man who breaks them. But in order that he
may be great and fit for that kingdom, he ought to do and teach as
Christ now teaches, *i.e.* in order that his righteousness may exceed
that of the scribes and Pharisees. The righteousness of the Pharisees
is, that they shall not kill; the righteousness of those who are
destined to enter into the kingdom of God, that they be not angry
without a cause. The least commandment, therefore, is not to kill; and
whosoever shall break that, shall be called least in the kingdom of
heaven; but whosoever shall fulfil that commandment not to kill, will
not, as a necessary consequence, be great and meet for the kingdom of
heaven, but yet he ascends a certain step. He will be perfected,
however, if he be not angry without a cause; and if he shall do this, he
will be much further removed from murder. For this reason he who teaches
that we should not be angry, does not break the law not to kill, but
rather fulfils it; so that we preserve our innocence both outwardly when
we do not kill, and in heart when we are not angry.

<span id="v.ii.ix-p4"></span>22. “Ye have heard” therefore, says He,
“that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and
whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say unto
you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) shall be in danger of the judgment: and
whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the
council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the
gehenna of fire.” What is the difference between being in danger of the
judgment, and being in danger of the council, and being in danger of the
gehenna of fire? <span id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) For this last
sounds most weighty, and reminds us that certain stages were passed over
from lighter to more weighty, until the gehenna of fire was reached.
And, therefore, if it is a lighter thing to be in danger of the judgment
than to be in danger of the council, and if it is also a lighter thing
to be in danger of the council than to be in danger of the gehenna of
fire, we must understand it to be a lighter thing to be angry with a
brother without a cause than to say “Raca;” and again, to be a lighter
thing to say “Raca” than to say “Thou fool.” For the danger would not
have gradations, unless the sins also were mentioned in gradation.

<span id="v.ii.ix-p7"></span>23. But here one obscure word has found a
place, for “Raca” is neither Latin nor Greek. The others, however, are
current in our language. Now, some have wished to derive the
interpretation of this expression from the Greek, supposing that a
ragged person is called “Raca,” because a rag is called in Greek <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.ix-p7.1"></span>ῥάκος</span>; yet, when one
asks them what a ragged person is called in Greek, they do not answer
“Raca;” and further, the Latin translator might have put the word
*ragged* where he has placed “Raca,” and not have used a word which, on
the one hand, has no existence in the Latin language, and, on the other,
is rare in the Greek. Hence the view is more probable which I heard from
a certain Hebrew whom I had asked about it; for he said that the word
does not mean anything, but merely expresses the emotion of an angry
mind. Grammarians call those particles of speech which express an
affection of an agitated mind *interjections*; as when it is said by one
who is grieved, “Alas,” or by one who is angry, “Hah.” And these words
in all languages are proper names, and are not easily translated into
another language; and this cause certainly compelled alike the Greek and
the Latin translators to put the word itself, inasmuch as they could
find no way of translating it. <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md)

<span id="v.ii.ix-p9"></span>24. There is therefore a gradation in the
sins referred to, so that first one is angry, and keeps that feeling as
a conception in his heart; but if now that emotion shall draw forth an
expression of anger not having any definite meaning, but giving evidence
of that feeling of the mind by the very fact of the outbreak wherewith
he is assailed with whom one is angry, this is certainly more than if
the rising anger were restrained by silence; but if there is heard not
merely an expression of anger, but also a word by which the party using
it now indicates and signifies a distinct censure of him against whom it
is directed, who doubts but that this is something more than if merely
an exclamation of anger were uttered? Hence in the first there is one
thing, *i.e.* anger alone; in the second two things, both anger and a
word that expresses anger; in the third three things, anger and a word
that expresses anger, and in that word the utterance of distinct
censure. Look now also at the three degrees of liability,—the judgment,
the council, the gehenna of fire. For in the judgment an opportunity is
still given for defence; in the council, however, although there is also
wont to be a judgment, yet because the very distinction <span
id="page_12">p. 12</span> <span id="v.ii.ix-Page_12"></span>compels us
to acknowledge that there is a certain difference in this place, the
production of the sentence seems to belong to the council, inasmuch as
it is not now the case of the accused himself that is in question,
whether he is to be condemned or not, but they who judge confer with one
another to what punishment they ought to condemn him, who, it is clear,
is to be condemned; but the gehenna of fire does not treat as a doubtful
matter either the condemnation, like the judgment, or the punishment of
him who is condemned, like the council; for in the gehenna of fire both
the condemnation and the punishment of him who is condemned are certain.
Thus there are seen certain degrees in the sins and in the liability to
punishment; <span id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) but who can tell in
what ways they are invisibly shown in the punishments of souls? We are
therefore to learn how great the difference is between the righteousness
of the Pharisees and that greater righteousness which introduces into
the kingdom of heaven, because while it is a more serious crime to kill
than to inflict reproach by means of a word, in the one case killing
exposes one to the judgment, but in the other anger exposes one to the
judgment, which is the least of those three sins; for in the former case
they were discussing the question of murder among men, but in the latter
all things are disposed of by means of a divine judgment, where the end
of the condemned is the gehenna of fire. But whoever shall say that
murder is punished by a more severe penalty under the greater
righteousness if a reproach is punished by the gehenna of fire, compels
us to understand that there are differences of gehennas.

<span id="v.ii.ix-p11"></span>25. Indeed, in the three statements before
us, we must observe that some words are understood. For the first
statement has all the words that are necessary. “Whosoever,” says He,
“is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the
judgment.” But in the second, when He says, “and whosoever shall say to
his brother, Raca,” there is understood the expression *without
cause*, <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md) and thus there is
subjoined, “shall be in danger of the council.” In the third, now, where
He says, “but whosoever shall say, Thou fool,” two things are
understood, both *to his brother* and *without cause*. And in this way
we defend the apostle when he calls the Galatians fools, <span
id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) to whom he also gives the name of
brethren; for he does not do it without cause. And here the word brother
is to be understood for this reason, that the case of an enemy is spoken
of afterwards, and how he also is to be treated under the greater
righteousness.

id="v.ii.ix-p2.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.ix-p3"></span> “With all their care, they had not
understood the true spirit of the law” (Schaff). The rest of the Sermon
is largely a comment on this verse, Christ giving His interpretation of
the law, and the righteousness following upon its observance; showing
that the purport goes beyond the external act of obedience to the
purpose of the heart, and that in the external act of obedience the real
purport might be ignored.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[11:80](1060015.htm#fr_79.md) <span
id="v.ii.ix-p4.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.ix-p5"></span> *Sine causa*. The weight of critical
evidence is against this clause, which is omitted by Tischendorf,
Westcott, and Hort, the Vulgate and the Revised Version.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[11:81](1060015.htm#fr_80.md) <span
id="v.ii.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.ix-p6"></span> The “judgment” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.ix-p6.1"></span>κρίσις</span>) was the local court of seven,
which every community was enjoined to have ([Deut. xvi.
18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018)<span id="v.ii.ix-p6.2"></span>.md).
The “council” was the Sanhedrin, consisting of seventy-two members,
sitting in Jerusalem. The “gehenna” was the vale of Hinnom, on the
confines of Jerusalem, where sacrifices were offered to Moloch, and
which became the place for refuse and the burning of dead bodies. In the
New Testament it is equivalent to “hell.”

<span id="fn_81"></span>[11:82](1060015.htm#fr_81.md) <span
id="v.ii.ix-p7.2"></span>

<span id="v.ii.ix-p8"></span> *Raca* is from the Chald. <span
class="Hebrew"><span id="v.ii.ix-p8.1"></span>רִיָקא</span>, and is a
term of contempt equivalent to empty-headed (Thayer’s *Lexicon*). Trench
translates, “Oh, vain man!”

<span id="fn_82"></span>[12:83](1060015.htm#fr_82.md) <span
id="v.ii.ix-p9.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.ix-p10"></span> It is important “to keep in mind that
there is no distinction in *kind* between these punishments, only of
*degree*. The ‘judgment’ (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.ix-p10.1"></span>κρίσις</span>) inflicted death by the sword,
the Sanhedrin death by stoning, and the disgrace of the gehenna followed
as an intensification of death; but the punishment is one and the
same,—*death*. So also in the subject of the similitude. All the
punishments are *spiritual*; all result in *eternal death*, but with
*various degrees*, as the degrees of guilt have been” (Alford).

<span id="fn_83"></span>[12:84](1060015.htm#fr_83.md) <span
id="v.ii.ix-p11.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.ix-p12"></span> Augustin helps us to understand how the
word <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.ix-p12.1"></span>εἰκῆ</span>
(*without cause*) in the preceding clause crept into some of the <span
class="c13"><span id="v.ii.ix-p12.2"></span> Mss.</span> In *Retract.*
I. xix. 4 he makes the critical note and correction: “*Codices græci non
habent sine causa.*”
