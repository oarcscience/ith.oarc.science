<span id="vi.v.lxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXII.—Of the Harmony
Characterizing the Narratives Given by These Three Evangelists Regarding
the Duty of Rendering to Cæsar the Coin Bearing His Image, and Regarding
the Woman Who Had Been Married to the Seven Brothers.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxxiii-p2"></span>140. Matthew then continues in these
terms: <span id="page_165">p. 165</span> <span
id="vi.v.lxxiii-Page_165"></span>“Then went the Pharisees, and took
counsel how they might entangle Him in His talk. And they send out unto
Him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that
thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou
for any man; for thou regardest not the person of men: tell us
therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar, or
not?” and so on, down to the words, “And when the multitude heard this,
they were astonished at His doctrine.” <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165) Mark and Luke give a similar
account of these two replies made by the Lord,—namely, the one on the
subject of the coin, which was prompted by the question as to the duty
of giving tribute to Cæsar; and the other on the subject of the
resurrection, which was suggested by the case of the woman who had
married the seven brothers in succession. Neither do these two
evangelists differ in the matter of the order. <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[1167](#fn_1166) For after the parable which told of
the men to whom the vineyard was let out, and which also dealt with the
Jews (against whom it was directed), and the evil counsel they were
devising (which sections are given by all three evangelists together),
these two, Mark and Luke, pass over the parable of the guests who were
invited to the wedding (which only Matthew has introduced), and
thereafter they join company again with the first evangelist, when they
record these two passages which deal with Cæsar’s tribute, and the woman
who was the wife of seven different husbands, inserting them in
precisely the same order, with a consistency which admits of no
question.
