<span id="vi.vi.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Of the Accounts Which are Given by
All the Four Evangelists in Regard to What Was Done and Said on the
Occasion of His Apprehension; And of the Proof that These Different
Narratives Exhibit No Real Discrepancies.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.vi-p2"></span>15. When we follow the versions presented
by Matthew and Mark, we find that the history now proceeds thus: “And
while He yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a
great multitude, with swords and staves, from the chief priests and
elders of the people. Now he that betrayed Him, gave them a sign,
saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is He; hold Him fast. And
forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Master; and kissed Him.”
 <span id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277.md) First of all, however, as we
gather from Luke’s statement, He said to the traitor, “Judas, betrayest
thou the Son of man with a kiss?” <span
id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278.md) Next, as we learn from Matthew, He
spoke thus: “Friend, wherefore art thou come?” Thereafter He added
certain words which are found in John’s narrative, which runs in the
following strain: “Whom seek ye? They answered Him, Jesus of Nazareth.
Jesus saith unto them, I am He. And Judas also, which betrayed Him,
stood with them. As soon then as He had said unto them, I am He, they
went backward, and fell to the ground. Then asked He them again, Whom
seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered, I have told
you that I am He: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way; that
the saying might be fulfilled which He spake, Of them which thou gavest
me have I lost none.” <span id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279.md)

<span id="vi.vi.vi-p6"></span>16. Next comes in a passage, which is
given by Luke as follows: “When they which were about Him saw what would
follow, they said unto Him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? And one
of them smote the servant of the high priest,” as is noticed by all the
four historians, “and cut off his ear,” which, as we are informed by
Luke and John, was his “right ear.” More<span id="page_184">p.
184</span> <span id="vi.vi.vi-Page_184"></span>over, we gather also from
John that the person who smote the servant was Peter, and that the name
of the man whom he thus struck was Malchus. Next we take what Luke
mentions, namely, “Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far;” <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280.md) with which we must connect the
words appended by Matthew, namely, “Put up thy sword into his place: for
all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou
that I cannot now pray to my Father, and He shall presently give me more
than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the Scriptures be
fulfilled, that thus it must be?” <span
id="fr_1281"></span>[1282](#fn_1281.md) Along with these words we may also
place the question to which John tells us He gave utterance on the same
occasion, namely, “The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not
drink it?” <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282.md) And then, as is
recorded by Luke, He touched the ear of the person who had been struck,
and healed him.

<span id="vi.vi.vi-p10"></span>17. Neither should we let the idea
disturb us, that some contradiction may be found in the circumstance
that Luke tells us how, when the disciples asked Him whether they should
smite with the sword, the Lord replied in these words, “Suffer ye thus
far,” in a manner which might seem to imply that He thus expressed
Himself, after the blow had been struck, in terms bearing that He was
satisfied with what had been done so far, but desired nothing further to
be done; whereas the language which is employed by Matthew might give us
rather to understand that this whole incident of the use which Peter
made of the sword was displeasing to the Lord. For it is more correct to
suppose that when they put the question to Him, “Lord, shall we smite
with the sword?” He replied then, “Suffer ye thus far;” His meaning
being this: “Let not what is about to take place agitate you. These men
are to be suffered to go thus far; that is to say, so far as to
apprehend me, and thus to effect the fulfilment of those things which
are written of me.” We have further to suppose, however, that during the
time which passed in the interchange of the question addressed by them
to the Lord, and the reply returned by Him to them, Peter was borne on
by his intense desire to appear as defender, and by his stronger
excitement in the Lord’s behalf, to deal the blow. But while these two
things might easily have happened at the same time, two different
statements could not have been uttered by the same person in one
breath. <span id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283.md) For the writer would
not have used the expression, “And Jesus answered and said,” unless the
words were a reply to the question which had been addressed by those who
were about Him, and not a statement directed to Peter’s act. For Matthew
is the only one who has recorded the judgment passed by Jesus on Peter’s
act. And in that passage the phrase which Matthew has employed is also
not in the form, “Jesus answered Peter thus, Put up thy sword;” but it
runs in these terms: “Then said Jesus unto him, Put up thy sword;” from
which it appears that it was after the deed that Jesus thus declared
Himself. What is contained, again, in the phraseology used by Luke,
namely, “And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far,” must be taken
to have been the reply which was returned to the parties who had put the
question to Him. But inasmuch as, according to our previous explanation,
the single blow with which the servant was struck was delivered just
during the time when the terms of the said question and answer were
passing between these persons and the Lord, the writer has considered it
right to record that act in the same particular order, so that it stands
inserted between the words of the interrogation and those in which the
response was couched. Consequently, there is nothing here in antagonism
to the statement introduced by Matthew, namely, “For all they that take
the sword shall perish with the sword,”—that is to say, those who may
have used the sword. But there might appear to be some inconsistency
here if the Lord’s answer were taken in a sense which would show Him to
have expressed approval on this occasion of the voluntary use of the
sword, even although it was only to the effect of a single wound, and
that, too, not a fatal one. The words, however, which were addressed to
Peter may be understood, as a whole, in an application quite in harmony
with the rest; so that, bringing in also what Luke and Matthew have
reported, as I have stated above, we obtain the following connection:
“Suffer ye thus far. Put up thy sword into its place; for all they that
take the sword shall perish with the sword,” etc. In what way, moreover,
this sentence, “Suffer ye thus far,” is to be understood, I have
explained already. And if there is any better method of interpreting it,
be it so. Only let the veracity of the evangelists be maintained in any
case.

<span id="vi.vi.vi-p12"></span>18. After this, Matthew continues the
narrative, and mentions that in that hour He addressed the multitude as
follows: “Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for
to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no
hold on me.” <span id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284.md) Then He added
also certain words, which Luke introduces thus: “But this is your hour,
and the power of darkness.” <span id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md)
Next comes the sentence given by Matthew: “But all this was done that
the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then <span
id="page_185">p. 185</span> <span id="vi.vi.vi-Page_185"></span>all the
disciples forsook Him and fled.” This last fact is recorded also by
Mark. The same evangelist makes also the following addition: “And there
followed Him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his
naked body; and when they laid hold on him, he left the linen cloth, and
fled from them naked.”  <span id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md)

the disciples and Peter’s act might easily have been synchronous, the
Lord could not have addressed Himself in different senses to two
distinct parties at the same time, namely, to the persons who put the
question, and to Peter.
