<span id="v.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xi-p2"></span>38. The sevenfold number of these
petitions also seems to me to correspond to that sevenfold number out of
which the whole sermon before us has had its rise. <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) For if it is the fear of God through
which the poor in spirit are blessed, inasmuch as theirs is the kingdom
of heaven; let us ask that the name of God may be hallowed among men
through that “fear which is clean, enduring for ever.” <span
id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) If it is piety through which the meek
are blessed, inasmuch as they shall inherit the earth; let us ask that
His kingdom may come, whether it be over ourselves, that we may become
meek, and not resist Him, or whether it be from heaven to earth in the
splendour of the Lord’s advent, in which we shall rejoice, and shall be
praised, when He says, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit <span
id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md) the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation <span id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340.md) of the world.” <span
id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341.md) For “in the Lord,” says the prophet,
“shall my soul be praised; the meek shall hear thereof, and be
glad.” <span id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342.md) If it is knowledge
through which those who mourn are blessed, inasmuch as they shall be
comforted; let us pray that His will may be done as in heaven so in
earth, because when the body, which is as it were the earth, shall agree
in a final and complete peace with the soul, which is as it were heaven,
we shall not mourn: for there is no other mourning belonging to this
present time, except when these contend against each other, and compel
us to say, “I see another law in my members, warring against the law of
my mind;” and to testify our grief with tearful voice, “O wretched <span
id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343.md) man that I am! who shall deliver me
from the body of this death?” <span id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md) If
it is fortitude through which those are blessed who hunger and thirst
after righteousness, inasmuch as they shall be filled; let us pray that
our daily bread may be given to us to-day, by which, supported and
sustained, we may be able to reach that most abundant fulness. If it is
prudence through which the merciful are blessed, inasmuch as they shall
obtain mercy; let us forgive their debts to our debtors, and let us pray
that ours may be forgiven to us. If it is understanding through which
the pure in heart are blessed, inasmuch as they shall see God; let us
pray not to be led into temptation, lest we should have a double heart,
in not seeking after a single good, to which we may refer all our
actings, but at the same time pursuing things temporal and earthly. For
temptations arising from those things which seem to men burdensome and
calamitous, have no power over us, if those other temptations have no
power which befall us through the enticements of such things as men
count good and cause for rejoicing. If it is wisdom through which the
peacemakers are blessed, inasmuch as they shall be called the children
of God; <span id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md) let us pray that we may
be freed from evil, for that very freedom will make us free, *i.e.* sons
of God, so that we may cry in the spirit of adoption, “Abba,
Father.” <span id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md)

<span id="v.iii.xi-p13"></span>39. Nor are we indeed carelessly to pass
by the circumstance, that of all those sentences in which the Lord has
taught us to pray, He has judged that that one is chiefly to be
commended which has reference to the forgiveness of sins: in which He
would have us to be merciful, because it is the only wisdom for escaping
misery. For in no other sentence do we pray in such a way <span
id="page_47">p. 47</span> <span id="v.iii.xi-Page_47"></span>that we, as
it were, enter into a compact with God: for we say, “Forgive us, as we
also forgive.” And if we lie in that compact, the whole prayer is
fruitless. For He speaks thus: “For if ye forgive men their trespasses,
your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men
their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.”
