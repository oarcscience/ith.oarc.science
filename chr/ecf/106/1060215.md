<span id="vi.vii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Of the Question How It Can Be
Shown that the Narrative of the Haul of Fishes Which Luke Has Given Us
is Not to Be Identified with the Record of an Apparently Similar
Incident Which John Has Reported Subsequently to the Lord’s
Resurrection; And of the Fact that from This Point on to the Lord’s
Supper, from Which Event Onwards to the End the Combined Accounts of All
the Evangelists Have Been Examined, No Difficulty Calling for Special
Consideration Emerges in the Gospel of Luke Any More Than in that of
Mark.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.x-p2"></span>10. Luke, then, commences his Gospel in
the following fashion: “There was in the days of Herod the king of
Judæa, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his
wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth;”and so
on, down to the passage where it is said, “Now when He had left
speaking, He said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down
your nets for a draught.” <span id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623) In
this whole section, there is nothing to stir any question as to
discrepancies. It is true that John appears to relate something
resembling the last passage. But what he gives is really something
widely different. I refer to what took place by the sea of Tiberias
after the Lord’s resurrection. <span
id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624) In that instance, not only is the
particular time extremely different, but the circumstances themselves
are of quite another character. For there the nets were cast on the
right side, and a hundred and fifty and three fishes were caught. It is
added, too, that they were great fishes. And the evangelist, therefore,
has felt it necessary to state, that “for all there were so many, yet
was not the net broken,” surely just because he had in view the previous
case, which is recorded by Luke, and in connection with which the nets
were broken <span id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625) by reason of the
multitude of fishes. As for the rest, Luke has not recounted things like
those which John has narrated, except in relation to the Lord’s passion
and resurrection. And this whole section, which comes in between the
Lord’s Supper and the conclusion, has already been handled by us in a
manner which has yielded, as the result of a comparison of the
testimonies of all the evangelists conjointly, the demonstration of an
entire absence of discrepancies between them.
