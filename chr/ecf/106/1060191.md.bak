id="vi.vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Of the Concord Preserved Among
All the Four Evangelists on the Subject of the Parting of His
Raiment.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xiii-p2"></span>39. Matthew goes on thus: “And after
they crucified Him, they parted His garments, casting lots: and sitting
down, they watched Him.” <span id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380.md) Mark
reports the same incident, as follows: “And crucifying Him, they parted
His garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.” <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381.md) In like manner Luke says: “And they
parted His raiment, and cast lots. And the people stood
beholding.” <span id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md) The occurrence is
thus recorded briefly by the first three. But John gives us a more
detailed narrative of the method in which the act was gone about. His
version runs thus: “Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus,
took His garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and
also His coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top
throughout. They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it,
but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments, and for my vesture they
did cast lots.” <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383.md)
