<span id="v.iii.vi"></span>

<span id="v.iii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.</span>

<span id="v.iii.vi-p2"></span>20. In the next place there follows, “Thy
kingdom come.” Just as the Lord Himself teaches in the Gospel that the
day of judgment will take place at the very time when the gospel shall
have been preached among all nations: <span
id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) a thing which belongs to the hallowing
of God’s name. For here also the expression “Thy kingdom come” is not
used in such a way as if God were not now reigning. But some one perhaps
might say the expression “come” meant *upon earth*; as if, indeed, He
were not even now really reigning upon earth, and had not always reigned
upon it from the foundation of the world. “Come,” therefore, is to be
understood in the sense of “manifested to men.” For in the same way also
as a light which is present is absent to the blind, and to those who
shut their eyes; so the kingdom of God, though it never departs from the
earth, is yet absent to those who are ignorant of it. But no one will be
allowed to be ignorant of the kingdom of God, when His Only-begotten
shall come from heaven, not only in a way to be apprehended by the
understanding, but also visibly in the person of the Divine Man, in
order to judge the quick and the dead. And after that judgment, *i.e.*
when the process of distinguishing and separating the righteous from the
unrighteous has taken place, God will so dwell in the righteous, that
there will be no need for any one being taught by man, but all will be,
as it is written, “taught of God.” <span
id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) Then will the blessed life in all its
parts be perfected in the saints unto eternity, just as now the most
holy and blessed heavenly angels are wise and blessed, from the fact
that God alone is their light; because the Lord hath promised this also
to His own: “In the resurrection,” says He, “they will be as the angels
in heaven.” <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md)

<span id="v.iii.vi-p6"></span>21. And therefore, after that petition
where we say, “Thy kingdom come,” there follows, “Thy will be done, as
in heaven so in earth:” *i.e.*, just as Thy will is in the angels who
are in heaven, so that they wholly cleave to Thee, and thoroughly enjoy
Thee, no error beclouding their wisdom, no misery hindering their
blessedness; so let it be done in Thy saints who are on earth, and made
from the earth, so far as the body is concerned, and who, although it is
into a heavenly habitation and exchange, are yet to be taken from the
earth. To this there is a reference also in that doxology of the angels,
“Glory to God in the highest, <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md)
and on earth peace to men of <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> <span
id="v.iii.vi-Page_41"></span>goodwill:” <span
id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md) so that when our goodwill has gone
before, which follows Him that calleth, the will of God is perfected in
us, as it is in the heavenly angels; so that no antagonism stands in the
way of our blessedness: and this is peace. “Thy will be done” is also
rightly understood in the sense of, Let obedience be rendered to Thy
precepts: “as in heaven so on earth,” *i.e.* as by the angels so by men.
For, that the will of God is done when His precepts are obeyed, the Lord
Himself says, when He affirms, “My meat is to do the will of Him that
sent me;” <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) and often, “I came,
not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me;” <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) and when He says, “Behold my mother
and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of God, <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) the same is my brother, and sister,
and mother.” <span id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) And therefore, in
those at least who do the will of God, the will of God is accomplished;
not because they cause God to will, but because they do what He wills,
*i.e.* they do according to His will.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p13"></span>22. There is also that other
interpretation, “Thy will be done as in heaven so on earth,”—as in the
holy and just, so also in sinners. And this, besides, may be understood
in two ways: either that we should pray even for our enemies (for what
else are they to be reckoned, in spite of whose will the Christian and
Catholic name still spreads?), so that it is said, “Thy will be done as
in heaven so on earth,”—as if the meaning were, As the righteous do Thy
will, in like manner let sinners also do it, so that they may be
converted unto Thee; or in this sense, “Let Thy will be done as in
heaven so on earth,” so that every one may get his own; which will take
place at the last judgment, the righteous being requited with a reward,
sinners with condemnation—when the sheep shall be separated from the
goats. <span id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md)

<span id="v.iii.vi-p15"></span>23. That other interpretation also is not
absurd, nay, it is thoroughly accordant with both our faith and hope,
that we are to take heaven and earth in the sense of spirit and flesh.
And since the apostle says, “With the mind I myself serve the law of
God, but with the flesh the law of sin,” <span
id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) we see that the will of God is done in
the mind, *i.e.* in the spirit. But when death shall have been swallowed
up in victory, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, which will
happen at the resurrection of the flesh, and at that change which is
promised to the righteous, according to the prediction of the same
apostle, <span id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) let the will of God be
done on earth, as it is in heaven; *i.e.*, in such a way that, in like
manner as the spirit does not resist God, but follows and does His will,
so the body also may not resist the spirit or soul, which at present is
harassed by the weakness of the body, and is prone to fleshly habit: and
this will be an element of the perfect peace in the life eternal, that
not only will the will be present with us, but also the performance of
that which is good. “For to will,” says he, “is present with me; but how
to perform that which is good I find not:” for not yet in earth as in
heaven, *i.e.* not yet in the flesh as in the spirit, is the will of God
done. For even in our misery the will of God is done, when we suffer
those things through the flesh which are due to us in virtue of our
mortality, which our nature has deserved because of its sin. But we are
to pray for this, that the will of God may be done as in heaven so in
earth; that in like manner as with the heart we delight in the law after
the inward man, <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) so also, when
the change in our body has taken place, no part of us may, on account of
earthly griefs or pleasures, stand opposed to this our delight.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p19"></span>24. Nor is that view inconsistent with
truth, that we are to understand the words, “Thy will be done as in
heaven so in earth,” as in our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, so also in the
Church: as if one were to say, As in the man who fulfilled the will of
the Father, so also in the woman who is betrothed to him. For heaven and
earth are suitably understood as if they were man and wife; since the
earth is fruitful from the heaven fertilizing it.
