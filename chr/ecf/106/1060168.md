<span id="vi.v.lxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXI.—Of the Marriage of the King’s
Son, to Which the Multitudes Were Invited; And of the Order in Which
Matthew Introduces that Section as Compared with Luke, Who Gives Us a
Somewhat Similar Narrative in Another Connection.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxxii-p2"></span>139. Matthew goes on as follows: “And
when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard His parables, they
perceived that He spake of them: and when they sought to lay hands on
Him, they feared the multitude, because they took Him for a prophet. And
Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, The
kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for
his son, and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to
the wedding, and they would not come;” and so on, down to the words,
“For many are called, but few are chosen.” <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162) This parable concerning the guests
who were invited to the wedding is related only by Matthew. Luke also
records something which resembles it. But that is really a different
passage, as the order itself sufficiently indicates, although there is
some similarity between the two. <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163) The matters introduced, however, by
Matthew immediately after the parable concerning the vineyard, and the
killing of the son of the head of the house,—namely, the Jews’
perception that this whole discourse was directed against them, and
their beginning to contrive treacherous schemes against Him,—are
attested likewise by Mark and Luke, who also keep the same order in
inserting them. <span id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164) But after
this paragraph they proceed to another subject, and immediately subjoin
a passage which Matthew has also indeed introduced in due order, but
only subsequently to this parable of the marriage, which he alone has
put on record here.
