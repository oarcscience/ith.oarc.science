<span id="vi.v.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Of the Date of His Departure
into Galilee.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xix-p2"></span>42. Furthermore, we must consider the
question how the evangelist John, before there is any mention of the
casting of John the Baptist into prison, tells us that Jesus went into
Galilee. For, after relating how He turned the water into wine at Cana
of Galilee, and how He came down to Capernaum with His mother and His
disciples, and how they abode there not many days, he tells us that He
went up then to Jerusalem on account of the passover; that after this He
came into the land of Judæa along with His disciples, and tarried there
with them, and baptized; and then in what follows at this point the
evangelist says: “And John also was baptizing in Ænon, near to Salim,
because there was much water there; and they came, and were baptized:
for John was not yet cast into prison.” <span
id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842) On the other hand, Matthew says: “Now
when He had heard that John was cast into prison, Jesus departed into
Galilee.” <span id="fr_843"></span>[844](#fn_843) In like manner, Mark’s
words are: “Now, after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
Galilee.” <span id="fr_844"></span>[845](#fn_844) Luke, again, says
nothing indeed about the imprisonment of John; but notwithstanding this,
after his account of the baptism and temptation of Christ, he also makes
a statement to the same effect with that of these other two, namely,
that Jesus went into Galilee. For he has connected the several parts of
his narrative here in this way: “And when all the temptation was ended,
the devil departed from Him for a season; and Jesus returned in the
power of the Spirit into Galilee, and there went out a fame of Him
through all the region round about.” <span
id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845) From all this, however, we may gather,
not that these three evangelists have made any statement opposed to the
evangelist John, but only that they have left unrecorded the Lord’s
first advent in Galilee after His baptism; on which occasion also He
turned the water into wine there. For at that period John had not yet
been cast into prison. And we are also to understand that these three
evangelists have introduced into the context of these narratives an
account of another journey of His into <span id="page_124">p. 124</span>
<span id="vi.v.xix-Page_124"></span>Galilee, which took place after
John’s imprisonment, regarding which return into Galilee the evangelist
John himself furnishes the following notice: “When, therefore, Jesus
knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus makes and baptizes more
disciples than John (though Jesus Himself baptized not, but His
disciples), he left Judæa, and departed again into Galilee.” <span
id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846) So, then, we perceive that by that
time John had been already cast into prison; and further, that the Jews
had heard that He was making and baptizing more disciples than John had
made and baptized.
