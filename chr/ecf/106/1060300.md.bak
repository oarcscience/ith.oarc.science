<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.lxxxiii-p3.1"></span>*[John vi.
53](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053.md)<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p3.2"></span>,
“Except ye eat the flesh,” etc., and on the words of the apostles. And
the Psalms. Against the Pelagians.*

<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p4"></span>Delivered at the Table of the Martyr
St. Cyprian, the 9th

<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p5"></span>of the Calends of October,—23 Sept., on
the Lord’s day.

<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p6"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.lxxxiii-p6.1"></span>We</span> have heard the True Master, the
Divine Redeemer, the human Saviour, commending to us our Ransom, His
Blood. For He spake to us of His Body and Blood; He called His Body
Meat, His Blood Drink. The faithful recognise the Sacrament of the
faithful. But the hearers what else do they but hear? When therefore
commending such Meat and such Drink He said, “Except ye shall eat My
Flesh and drink My Blood, ye shall have no life in you;”  <span
id="fr_3906"></span>[3907](#fn_3906.md) (and this that He said concerning
life, who else said it but the Life Itself? But that man shall have
death, not life, who shall think that the Life is false), His disciples
were offended, not all of them indeed, but very many, saying within
themselves, “This is an hard saying, who can hear it?” <span
id="fr_3907"></span>[3908](#fn_3907.md) But when the Lord knew this in
Himself, and heard the murmurings of their thought, He answered them,
thinking though uttering nothing, that they might understand that they
were heard, and might cease to entertain such thoughts. What then did He
answer? “Doth this offend you?” “What then if ye shall see the Son of
Man ascend up where He was before?” <span
id="fr_3908"></span>[3909](#fn_3908.md) What meaneth this? “Doth this
offend you?” “Do ye imagine that I am about to make divisions of this My
Body which ye see; and to cut up My Members, and give them to you? ‘What
then if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before?’”
Assuredly, He who could ascend Whole could not be consumed. So then He
both gave us of His Body and Blood a healthful refreshment, and briefly
solved so great a question as to His Own Entireness. Let them then who
eat, eat on, and them that drink, drink; let them hunger and thirst; eat
Life, drink Life. That eating, is to be refreshed; but thou art in such
wise refreshed, as that that whereby thou art refreshed, faileth not.
That drinking, what is it but to live? Eat Life, drink Life; thou shalt
have life, and the Life is Entire. But then this shall be, that is, the
Body and the Blood of Christ shall be each man’s Life; if what is taken
in the Sacrament visibly is in the truth itself eaten spiritually, drunk
spiritually. For we have heard the Lord Himself saying, “It is the
Spirit That quickeneth, but the flesh profiteth nothing. The words that
I have spoken unto you, are Spirit and Life. But there are some of you,”
saith He, “that believe not.” <span id="fr_3909"></span>[3910](#fn_3909.md)
Such were they who said, “This is a hard saying, who can hear it?” It is
hard, but only to the hard; that is, it is incredible, but only to the
incredulous.

<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p11"></span>2. But in order to teach us that this
very believing is matter of gift, not of desert, He saith, “As I have
said unto you, no man cometh unto Me, except it were given him of My
Father.” <span id="fr_3910"></span>[3911](#fn_3910.md) Now as to where the
Lord said this, if we call to mind the foregoing words of the Gospel, we
shall find that He had said, “No man cometh unto Me, except the Father
which hath sent Me draw him.” <span id="fr_3911"></span>[3912](#fn_3911.md)
He did not lead, but draw. This violence is done to the heart, not the
body. Why then dost thou marvel? Believe, and thou comest; love, and
thou art drawn. Do not suppose here any rough and uneasy violence; it is
gentle, it is sweet; it is the very sweetness that draweth thee. Is not
a sheep drawn, when fresh grass is shown to it in its hunger? Yet I
imagine that it is not bodily driven on, but fast bound by desire. In
such wise do thou come too to Christ; do not conceive of long
journeyings; where thou believest, there thou comest. For unto Him, who
is everywhere we come by love, not by sailing. But forasmuch as even in
this kind of voyage, waves and tempests of divers temptations abound;
believe on the Crucified; that thy faith may be able to ascend the Wood.
Thou shalt not sink, but shalt be borne upon the Wood. Thus, even thus,
amid the waves of this world did he sail, who said, “But God forbid that
I should glory, save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.”  <span
id="fr_3912"></span>[3913](#fn_3912.md)

<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p15"></span>3. But wonderful it is, that when
Christ Crucified is preached, two hear, one despiseth, the other
ascendeth. Let him that despiseth, impute it to himself; let not him
that ascendeth, arrogate it to himself. For he hath heard from the True
Master; “No man cometh unto Me, except <span id="page_502">p. 502</span>
<span id="vii.lxxxiii-Page_502"></span>it were given unto him of My
Father.” Let him joy, that it hath been given; let him render thanks to
Him who giveth it, with a humble, not an arrogant heart; lest what he
hath attained <span id="fr_3913"></span>[3914](#fn_3913.md) through
humility, he lose through pride. For even they who are already walking
in this way of righteousness, if they attribute it to themselves, and to
their own strength, perish out of it. And therefore Holy Scripture
teaching us humility saith by the Apostle, “Work out your own salvation
with fear and trembling.” <span id="fr_3914"></span>[3915](#fn_3914.md) And
lest hereupon they should attribute ought to themselves, because he
said, “Work,” he subjoined immediately, “For it is God who worketh in
you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.” <span
id="fr_3915"></span>[3916](#fn_3915.md) “It is God who worketh in you;”
therefore “with fear and trembling,” make a valley, receive the rain.
Low grounds are filled, high grounds are dried up. Grace is rain. Why
dost thou marvel then, if “God resist the proud, and giveth grace unto
the lowly”? <span id="fr_3916"></span>[3917](#fn_3916.md) Therefore, “with
fear and trembling;” that is, with humility. “Be not high-minded, but
fear.” <span id="fr_3917"></span>[3918](#fn_3917.md) Fear that thou mayest
be filled; be not high-minded, lest thou be dried up.

<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p21"></span>4. But you will say, “I am walking in
this way already; once there was need for me to learn, there was need
for me to know by the teaching of the law what I had to do: now I have
the free choice of the will; who shall withdraw me from this way?” If
thou read carefully, thou wilt find that a certain man began to uplift
himself, on a certain abundance of his, which he had nevertheless
received; but that the Lord in mercy, to teach him humility, took away
what He had given; and he was on a sudden reduced to poverty, and
confessing the mercy of God in his recollection, he said, “In my
abundance I said, I shall never be moved.” <span
id="fr_3918"></span>[3919](#fn_3918.md) “In my abundance I said.” But I
said it, I who am a man said it; “All men are liars, I said.” <span
id="fr_3919"></span>[3920](#fn_3919.md) Therefore, “in my abundance I
said;” so great was the abundance, that I dared to say, “I shall never
be moved.” What next? “O Lord, in Thy favour Thou gavest strength to my
beauty.” But “Thou turnedst away Thy Face from me, and I was
troubled.” <span id="fr_3920"></span>[3921](#fn_3920.md) “Thou hast shown
me,” saith he, “that that wherein I did abound, was of Thee. Thou hast
shown me Whence I should seek, to Whom attribute what I had received, to
Whom I ought to render thanks, to Whom I should run in my thirst,
Whereby be filled, and with Whom keep that whereby I should be filled.
‘For my strength will I keep to Thee;’ <span
id="fr_3921"></span>[3922](#fn_3921.md) whereby I am by Thy bounty filled,
through Thy safe keeping I will not lose. ‘My strength will I keep to
Thee.’ That Thou mightest show me this, ‘Thou turnedst away Thy Face
from me, and I was troubled.’ ‘Troubled,’ because dried up; dried up,
because exalted. Say then thou dry and parched one, that thou mayest be
filled again; ‘My soul is as earth without water unto Thee.’ <span
id="fr_3922"></span>[3923](#fn_3922.md) Say, ‘My soul is as earth without
water unto Thee.’ For Thou hast said, not the Lord, ‘I shall never be
moved.’ Thou hast said it, presuming on thine own strength; but it was
not of thyself, and thou didst think as if it were.”

<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p27"></span>5. What then doth the Lord say? “Serve
ye the Lord in fear, and rejoice unto Him with trembling.” <span
id="fr_3923"></span>[3924](#fn_3923.md) So the Apostle too, “Work out your
own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God who worketh in
you.” Therefore rejoice with trembling: “Lest at any time the Lord be
angry.” I see that you anticipate me by your crying out. For you know
what I am about to say, you anticipate it by crying out. And whence have
ye this, but that He taught you to whom ye have by believing come? This
then He saith; hear what ye know already; I am not teaching, but in
preaching am calling to your remembrance; nay, I am neither teaching,
seeing that ye know already, nor calling to remembrance, seeing that ye
remember, but let us say all together what together with us ye retain.
“Embrace discipline, and rejoice,” but, “with trembling,” <span
id="fr_3924"></span>[3925](#fn_3924.md) that, humble ye may ever hold fast
that which ye have received. “Lest at any time the Lord be angry;” with
the proud of course, attributing to themselves what they have, not
rendering thanks to Him, from whom they have. “Lest at any time the Lord
be angry, and ye perish from the righteous way.” Did he say, Lest at any
time the Lord be angry, and ye come not into the righteous way”? Did he
say, “Lest the Lord be angry, and He bring you not to the righteous
way”? or “admit you not into the righteous way? Ye are walking in it
already, be not proud, lest ye even perish from it. ‘And ye perish,’
saith he, ‘from the righteous way.’” “When His wrath shall be kindled in
a short time” <span id="fr_3925"></span>[3926](#fn_3925.md) against you. At
no distant time. As soon as thou art proud, thou losest at once what
thou hadst received. As though man terrified by all this were to say,
“What shall I do then?” It follows, “Blessed are all they that trust in
Him:” not in themselves, but in Him. “By grace are we saved, not of
ourselves, but it is the gift of God.” <span
id="fr_3926"></span>[3927](#fn_3926.md)

<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p32"></span>6. Peradventure ye are saying, “What
does he mean, that he is so often saying this? A second and a third time
he says it; and scarcely ever speaks, but when he says it.” Would that I
may not say it in vain! For men there are <span id="page_503">p.
503</span> <span id="vii.lxxxiii-Page_503"></span>unthankful to grace,
attributing much to poor and disabled nature. True it is, when man was
created he received great power of free-will; but he lost it by sin. He
fell into death, became infirm, was left in the way by the robbers half
dead; the Samaritan, which is by interpretation keeper, passing by
lifted him up on his own beast; <span
id="fr_3927"></span>[3928](#fn_3927.md) he is still being brought to the
inn. Why is he lifted up? He is still in process of curing. “But,” he
will say, “it is enough for me that in baptism I received remission of
all sins.” Because iniquity was blotted out, was therefore infirmity
brought to an end? “I received,” says he, “remission of all sins.” It is
quite true. All sins were blotted out in the Sacrament of Baptism, all
entirely, of words, deeds, thoughts, all were blotted out. But this is
the “oil and wine” which was poured in by the way. Ye remember, beloved
Brethren, that man who was wounded by the robbers, and half dead by the
way, how he was strengthened, by receiving oil and wine for his wounds.
His error indeed was already pardoned, and yet his weakness is in
process of healing in the inn. The inn, if ye recognise it, is the
Church. In the time present, an inn, because in life we are passing by:
it will be a home, whence we shall never remove, when we shall have got
in perfect health unto the kingdom of heaven. Meanwhile receive we
gladly our treatment in the inn, and weak as we still are, glory we not
of sound health: lest through our pride we gain nothing else, but never
for all our treatment to be cured.

<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p34"></span>7. “Bless the Lord, O my soul.” <span
id="fr_3928"></span>[3929](#fn_3928.md) Say, yea say to thy soul, “Thou art
still in this life, still bearest about a frail flesh, still “doth the
corruptible body press down the soul;” <span
id="fr_3929"></span>[3930](#fn_3929.md) still after the entireness of
remission hast thou received the remedy of prayer; for still, whilst thy
weaknesses are being healed, dost thou say, “Forgive us our
debts.” <span id="fr_3930"></span>[3931](#fn_3930.md) Say then to thy soul,
thou lowly valley, not an exalted hill; say to thy soul, “Bless the
Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits.” <span
id="fr_3931"></span>[3932](#fn_3931.md) What benefits? Tell them, enumerate
them, render thanks. What benefits? “Who forgiveth all thine
iniquities.” <span id="fr_3932"></span>[3933](#fn_3932.md) This took place
in baptism. What takes place now? “Who healeth all thy weaknesses.” This
takes place now; I acknowledge. But as long as I am here, “the
corruptible body presseth down the soul.” Say then also that which comes
next, “Who redeemeth thy life from corruption.” <span
id="fr_3933"></span>[3934](#fn_3933.md) After redemption from corruption,
what remaineth? “When this corruptible shall have put on incorruption,
and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to
pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
Where, O death, is thy contention?” There rightly, “O death, where is
thy sting?” <span id="fr_3934"></span>[3935](#fn_3934.md) Thou seekest its
place, and findest it not. What is “the sting of death”? What is, “O
death, where is thy sting?” Where is sin? Thou seekest, and it is
nowhere. For “the sting of death is sin.” They are the Apostle’s words,
not mine. Then shall it be said, “O death, where is thy sting?” Sin
shall nowhere be, neither to surprise thee, nor to assault thee, nor to
inflame <span id="fr_3935"></span>[3936](#fn_3935.md) thy conscience. Then
it shall not be said, “Forgive us our debts.” But what shall be said? “O
Lord our God, give us peace: for Thou hast rendered all things unto
us.” <span id="fr_3936"></span>[3937](#fn_3936.md)

<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p44"></span>8. Finally, after the redemption from
all corruption, what remaineth but the crown of righteousness? This at
least remaineth, but even in it, or under it, let not the head be
swollen that it may receive the crown. Hear, mark well the Psalm, how
that crown will not have a swollen head. After he had said, “Who
redeemeth thy life from corruption;” he saith, “Who crowneth thee.” Here
thou wert ready at once to say, “‘Crowneth thee,’ is an acknowledgment
of my merits, my own excellence hath done it; it is the payment of a
debt, not a gift.” Give ear rather to the Psalm. For it is thou again
that sayest this; and “all men are liars.” <span
id="fr_3937"></span>[3938](#fn_3937.md) Hear what God saith; “Who crowneth
thee with mercy and pity.” Of His mercy He crowneth thee, of His pity He
crowneth thee. For thou hadst no worthiness that He should call thee,
and being called should justify thee, being justified glorify thee. “The
remnant is saved by the election of grace. But if by grace, then is it
no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace. For to him that
worketh, the reward shall not be reckoned according to grace, but
according to debt.”  <span id="fr_3938"></span>[3939](#fn_3938.md) The
Apostle saith, “Not according to grace, but according to debt.” But
“thee He crowneth with pity and mercy;” and if thy own merits have gone
before, God saith to thee, “Examine well thy merits, and thou shalt see
that they are My gifts.”

<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p47"></span>9. This then is the righteousness of
God. As it is called, “The Lord’s salvation,” <span
id="fr_3939"></span>[3940](#fn_3939.md) not whereby the Lord is saved, but
which He giveth to them whom He saveth; so too the grace of God through
Jesus Christ our Lord is called the righteousness of God, not as that
whereby the Lord is righteous, but whereby He justifieth those whom of
ungodly He maketh righteous. But some, as the Jews in former times, both
wish to be called Christians, and still ignorant of God’s righteousness,
desire to establish their own, even in our own times, in the times of
open grace, the times of the full revelation of grace <span
id="page_504">p. 504</span> <span id="vii.lxxxiii-Page_504"></span>which
before was hidden; in the times of grace now manifested in the floor,
which once lay hid in the fleece. I see that a few have understood me,
that more have not understood, whom I will by no means defraud by
keeping silence. Gideon, one of the righteous men of old, asked for a
sign from the Lord, and said, “I pray, Lord, that this fleece which I
put in the floor be bedewed, <span id="fr_3940"></span>[3941](#fn_3940.md)
and that the floor be dry.” <span id="fr_3941"></span>[3942](#fn_3941.md)
And it was so; the fleece was bedewed, the whole floor was dry. In the
morning he wrung out the fleece in a basin; forasmuch as to the humble
is grace given; and in a basin, ye know what the Lord did to His
disciples. Again, he asked for another sign; “O Lord, I would,” saith
he, “that the fleece be dry, the floor bedewed.” And it was so. Call to
mind the time of the Old Testament, grace was hidden in a cloud, as the
rain in the fleece. Mark now the time of the New Testament, consider
well the nation of the Jews, thou wilt find it as a dry fleece; whereas
the whole world, like that floor, is full of grace, not hidden, but
manifested. Wherefore we are forced exceedingly to bewail our brethren,
who strive not against hidden, but against open and manifested grace.
There is allowance for the Jews. What shall we say of Christians?
Wherefore are ye enemies to the grace of Christ? Why rely ye on
yourselves? Why unthankful? For why did Christ come? Was not nature here
before? Was not nature here, which ye only deceive by your excessive
praise? Was not the Law here? But the Apostle says, “If righteousness
come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain.” <span
id="fr_3942"></span>[3943](#fn_3942.md) What the Apostle says of the Law,
that say we of nature to these men. “If righteousness come by nature,
then Christ is dead in vain.”

<span id="vii.lxxxiii-p52"></span>10. What then was said of the Jews,
the same altogether do we see in these men now. “They have a zeal of
God: I hear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according
to knowledge.” <span id="fr_3943"></span>[3944](#fn_3943.md) What is, “not
according to knowledge”? “For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and
wishing to establish their own, they have not submitted themselves unto
the righteousness of God.” <span id="fr_3944"></span>[3945](#fn_3944.md) My
Brethren, share with me in my sorrow. When ye find such as these, do not
hide them; be there no such misdirected <span
id="fr_3945"></span>[3946](#fn_3945.md) mercy in you; by all means, when ye
find such, hide them not. Convince the gainsayers, and those who resist,
bring to us. For already have two <span
id="fr_3946"></span>[3947](#fn_3946.md) councils on this question been sent
to the Apostolic see; and rescripts also have come from thence. The
question has been brought to an issue; would that their error may
sometime be brought to an issue too! Therefore do we advise that they
may take heed, we teach that they may be instructed, we pray that they
may be changed. Let us turn to the Lord, etc.
