<span id="vii.xxxii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xxxii-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. xvii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#019.md)<span id="vii.xxxii-p3.2"></span>,
“Why could not we cast it out”? etc., and on prayer.*

<span id="vii.xxxii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xxxii-p4.1"></span>Our</span> Lord Jesus Christ reproved
unbelief even in His own disciples, as we heard just now when the Gospel
was being read. For when they had said, “Why could not we cast him out?”
He answered, “Because of your unbelief.” <span
id="fr_2668"></span>[2669](#fn_2668.md) If the Apostles were unbelievers,
who is a believer? What must the lambs do, if the rams totter? Yet the
mercy of the Lord did not disdain them in their unbelief; but reproved,
nourished, perfected, crowned them. For they themselves, as mindful of
their own weakness, said to Him, as we read in a certain place in the
Gospel, “Lord, increase our faith. <span
id="fr_2669"></span>[2670](#fn_2669.md) Lord,” say they, “increase our
faith.” The knowing that they had a deficiency, was the first advantage;
a greater happiness still, to know who it was of whom they were asking.
“Lord,” say they, “increase our faith.” See, if they did not bring their
hearts as it were to the fountain, and knocked that that might be opened
to them, out of which they might fill them. For He would that men should
knock at Him, not that He might repel those that knock, but that He
might exercise those who long.

<span id="vii.xxxii-p7"></span>2. For do you think, Brethren, that God
doth not know what is needful for you? He knoweth and preventeth our
desires, who knoweth our want. And so when He taught His disciples to
pray, and warned them not to use many words in prayer, He saith, “Use
not many words; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of
before ye ask Him.” <span id="fr_2670"></span>[2671](#fn_2670.md) Now the
Lord saith something different from this. What is this? Because He
misliked that we should use many words in prayer, He said to us, “When
ye pray, use not many words; for your Father knoweth what things ye have
need of before ye ask Him.” If our “Father knoweth what things we have
need of before we ask Him,” why do we use even few words? What is the
use of prayer at all, if “our Father knoweth” already “what things we
have need of”? He saith to one, Do not make thy prayer to Me at great
length; for I know what is needful for thee. If so, Lord, why should I
so much as pray at all? Thou wouldest not that I should use long
prayers, yea rather Thou dost even bid me to use near none at all. And
then what meaneth that precept in another place? For He who saith, “Use
not many words in prayer,” saith in another place, “Ask, and it shall be
given you.” <span id="fr_2671"></span>[2672](#fn_2671.md) And that thou
mightest not think that this first precept to ask was given cursorily,
He added, “Seek, and ye shall find.” And that thou mightest not think
that this too was cursorily given, see what He added further, see with
what He finished. “Knock, and it shall be opened unto you:” see what He
added. He would have thee ask that thou mayest receive, and seek that
thou mayest find, and knock that thou mayest enter in. Seeing then that
our Father knoweth already what is needful for us, how and <span
id="page_350">p. 350</span> <span id="vii.xxxii-Page_350"></span>why do
we ask? why seek? why knock? why weary ourselves in asking, and seeking,
and knocking, to instruct Him who knoweth already? And in another place
the words of the Lord are, “Men ought always to pray, and not to
faint.” <span id="fr_2672"></span>[2673](#fn_2672.md) If men “ought always
to pray,” how doth He say, “Use not many words”? How can I always pray,
if I so quickly make an end? Here Thou biddest me to finish quickly;
there “always to pray and not to faint:” what doth this mean? Now that
thou mayest understand this, “ask, seek, knock.” For for this cause is
it closed, not to shut thee out, but to exercise thee. Therefore,
brethren, ought we to exhort to prayer, both ourselves and you. For
other hope have we none amid the manifold evils of this present world,
than to knock in prayer, to believe and to maintain the belief firm in
the heart, that thy Father only doth not give thee what He knoweth is
not expedient for thee. For thou knowest what thou dost desire; He
knoweth what is good for thee. Imagine thyself under a physician, and in
weak health, as is the very truth; for all this life of ours is a
weakness; and a long life is nothing else but a prolonged weakness.
Imagine thyself then to be sick under the physician’s hand. Thou hast a
desire to ask thy physician leave to drink a draught of fresh wine. Thou
art not prohibited from asking, for it may chance to do thee no harm, or
even good to receive it. Do not then hesitate to ask; ask, hesitate not;
but if thou receive not, do not take it to heart. Now if thou wouldest
act thus in the hands of a man, the physician of the body, how much more
in the hands of God, who is the Physician, the Creator, and Restorer,
both of thy body and soul?

<span id="vii.xxxii-p11"></span>3. Wherefore, see how the Lord in this
passage exhorted His disciples to prayer, when He said, “Ye could not
cast out this devil because of your unbelief.” <span
id="fr_2673"></span>[2674](#fn_2673.md) For then exhorting them to prayer
He ended thus; “this kind is not cast out but by prayer and fasting.” If
a man must pray, to cast out devils from another, how much more to cast
out his own covetousness? how much more to cast out his own drunkenness?
how much more to cast out his own luxuriousness? how much more to cast
out his own uncleanness? How many things in a man are there, which if
they are persevered in, allow of no admission into the kingdom of
heaven! Consider, Brethren, how a physician is entreated for the
preservation of temporal health, how, if any one is desperately ill, is
he ashamed or slow to throw himself at a man’s feet? to bathe in tears
the footsteps of any very able chief physician? And what if the
physician say to him, “Thou canst not else be cured, except I bind thee,
and use the fire and knife”? He will answer,” Do what thou wilt, only
cure me.” With what eagerness does he long for the health of a few days,
fleeting as a vapour, that for it he is content to be bound, and submit
to the fire, and knife, and to be watched, that he neither eat nor drink
what, or when, he pleases! All this he will endure, that he may die a
little later; and yet he will not endure ever so little, that he may
never die. If God, who is the Heavenly Physician over us, saith to thee,
“Wilt thou be cured?” what wouldest thou say but “Yes.” Or it may be
thou wouldest not say so, because thou fanciest thyself to be in health,
that is, because thou art more grievously sick.

<span id="vii.xxxii-p13"></span>4. For if we suppose two sick persons,
one who implores the physician with tears, the other, who in his
sickness with infatuation derides him; he will hold out hope to the one
that weeps, and will deplore the case of the other that laughs. Why? but
because the sounder in health he thinks himself, the more dangerous his
sickness is! This was the case with the Jews. Christ came to them that
were sick; He found them all sick. Let no one then flatter himself on
his healthful state, lest the physician give him up. <span
id="fr_2674"></span>[2675](#fn_2674.md) He found all sick; it is the
Apostle’s judgment, “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of
God.” <span id="fr_2675"></span>[2676](#fn_2675.md) Though He found them
all sick, yet were there two sorts of sick folk. The one came to the
Physician, clave to Christ, heard, honoured, followed Him, were
converted. He received all without disdaining any, for to heal them, who
healed of free favour, who cured by Almighty power. When then He
received them, and joined them to Himself to be healed, they rejoiced.
But there was another sort of sick, who had already become infatuated
through the sickness of iniquity, and did not know themselves to be
sick; they mocked Him, because He received the sick, and said to His
disciples, “Lo, what manner of man is your Master, who eateth with
publicans and sinners.” And He who knew what and who they were answered
them, “They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.”
And He showed them who the “whole” were, and who the “sick.” “I am not
come,” He saith, “to call the righteous, but sinners.” <span
id="fr_2676"></span>[2677](#fn_2676.md) If sinners, He would say, do not
come to Me, wherefore am I come? for whose sake am I come? If all are
whole, wherefore hath so great a Physician come down from heaven? why
hath He prepared for us a medicine not out of His stores, <span
id="fr_2677"></span>[2678](#fn_2677.md) but of His own blood? That sort of
sick then who had a milder sickness, who felt themselves to be sick,
clave to the Physician, that they might be healed. But they whose
sickness was <span id="page_351">p. 351</span> <span
id="vii.xxxii-Page_351"></span>more dangerous mocked the Physician, and
abused the sick. Whither did their frenzy proceed at last? To seize the
Physician, bind, scourge, crown Him with thorns, hang Him upon a Tree,
kill Him on the Cross! Why dost thou marvel? The sick slew the
Physician; but the Physician by being slain healed the frantic patient.

<span id="vii.xxxii-p18"></span>5. For first, not forgetting on the
Cross His own character, <span id="fr_2678"></span>[2679](#fn_2678.md) and
manifesting forth His patience to us, and giving us an example of love
to our enemies; as He saw them raging round Him, who had known their
disease, seeing He was the Physician, who had known the frenzy by which
they had become infatuated, He said at once to the Father, “Father,
forgive them; for they know not what they do.” <span
id="fr_2679"></span>[2680](#fn_2679.md) Now suppose ye that those Jews were
not malignant, cruel, bloody, turbulent, and enemies of the Son of God?
Suppose ye that that cry, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what
they do,” was ineffectual and in vain? He saw them all, but He knew
amongst them those that should one day be His. In a word, He died,
because it was so expedient, that by His Death He might kill death. God
died, that an exchange might be effected by a kind of heavenly contract,
that man might not see death. For Christ is God, but He died not in that
Nature in which He is God. For the same Person is God and man; for God
and man is one Christ. The human nature <span
id="fr_2680"></span>[2681](#fn_2680.md) was assumed, that we might be
changed for the better; He did not degrade the Divine <span
id="fr_2681"></span>[2682](#fn_2681.md) Nature down to the lower. For He
assumed that which He was not, He did not lose that which He was.
Forasmuch then as He is both God and man, being pleased that we should
live by that which was His, He died in that which was ours. For He had
nothing Himself, whereby He could die; nor had we anything whereby we
could live. For what was He who had nothing whereby He could die? “In
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God.”  <span id="fr_2682"></span>[2683](#fn_2682.md) If thou seek for
anything in God whereby He may die, thou wilt not find it. But we all
die, who are flesh; men bearing about sinful flesh. Seek out for that
whereby sin may live; it hath it not. So then neither could He have
death in that which was His own, nor we life in that which was our own;
but we have life from that which is His, He death from what is ours.
What an exchange! What hath He given, and what received? Men who trade
enter into commercial intercourse for exchange of things. For ancient
commerce was only an exchange of things. A man gave what he had, and
received what he had not. For example, he had wheat, but had no barley;
another had barley, but no wheat; the former gave the wheat which he
had, and received the barley which he had not. How <span
id="fr_2683"></span>[2684](#fn_2683.md) simple it was that the larger
quantity should make up for the cheaper sort! So then another man gives
barley, to receive wheat; lastly, another gives lead, to receive silver,
only he gives much lead against a little silver; another gives wool, to
receive a ready-made garment. And who can enumerate all these exchanges?
But no one gives life to receive death. Not in vain then was the voice
of the Physician as He hung upon the tree. For in order that He might
die for us because the Word could not die, “The Word was made flesh, and
dwelt among us.” <span id="fr_2684"></span>[2685](#fn_2684.md) He hung upon
the Cross, but in the flesh. There was the meanness, <span
id="fr_2685"></span>[2686](#fn_2685.md) which the Jews despised; there the
dearness, <span id="fr_2686"></span>[2687](#fn_2686.md) by which the Jews
were delivered. For for them was it said, “Father, forgive them, for
they know not what they do.” <span id="fr_2687"></span>[2688](#fn_2687.md)
And that voice was not in vain. He died, was buried, rose again, having
passed forty days with His disciples, He ascended into heaven, He sent
the Holy Ghost on them, who waited for the promise. They were filled
with the Holy Ghost, whom they had received, and began to speak with the
tongues of all nations. Then the Jews who were present, amazed that
unlearned and ignorant men, whom they had known as brought up among them
with one tongue, should in the Name of Christ speak in all tongues, were
in astonishment, and learnt from Peter’s words whence this gift came. He
gave it, who hung upon the tree. He gave it, who was derided as He hung
upon the tree, that from His seat in heaven He might give the Holy
Spirit. They of whom He had said, “Father, forgive them, for they know
not what they do,” heard, believed. They believed, were baptized, and
their conversion was effected. What conversion? In faith they drank the
Blood of Christ, which in fury they had shed.

<span id="vii.xxxii-p29"></span>6. Therefore, to finish this discourse
with that with which we began it, let us pray, and let us rely on God;
let us live as He enjoineth; and when we totter in this life, let us
call upon Him as the disciples called, saying, “Lord, increase our
faith.” <span id="fr_2688"></span>[2689](#fn_2688.md) Peter both put his
trust in Him, and tottered; but notwithstanding he was not disregarded
and left to sink, but was lifted up and raised. For his trust whence was
it? Not from anything of his own; but from what was the Lord’s. How?
“Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the water.” For on the
water was the Lord walking. “If it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the
water.” For I know that if it be Thou, Thou biddest, and it is done.
“And He saith, Come.” He went down at His bidding, but in his own
weakness he was afraid. Never<span id="page_352">p. 352</span> <span
id="vii.xxxii-Page_352"></span>theless when he was afraid, he cried out,
“Lord, save me.” Then the Lord took him by the hand, and said, “O thou
of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?” <span
id="fr_2689"></span>[2690](#fn_2689.md) He first invited him, He delivered
him, as he tottered, and stumbled; that it might be fulfilled which was
said in the Psalm, “If I said my foot hath slipped, Thy mercy, O Lord,
aided me.” <span id="fr_2690"></span>[2691](#fn_2690.md)

<span id="vii.xxxii-p33"></span>7. There are then two kinds of
blessings, temporal and eternal. Temporal blessings are health,
substance, honour, friends, a home, children, a wife, and the other
things of this life in which we are sojourners. Put we up then in the
hostelry of this life as travellers passing on, and not as owners
intending to remain. But eternal blessings are, first, eternal life
itself, the incorruption and immortality of body and soul, the society
of Angels, the heavenly city, glory <span
id="fr_2691"></span>[2692](#fn_2691.md) unfailing, Father and father-land,
the former without death, the latter without a foe. These blessings let
us desire with all eagerness, let us ask with all perseverance, not with
length of words, but with the witness of groans. Longing desire prayeth
always, though the tongue be silent. If thou art ever longing, thou art
ever praying. When sleepeth prayer? When desire groweth cold. So then
let us beg for these eternal blessings with all eager desire, let us
seek for those good things with an entire earnestness, let us ask for
those good things with all assurance. For those good things do profit
him that hath them, they cannot harm him. But those other temporal good
things sometimes profit, and sometimes harm. Poverty hath profited many,
and wealth hath harmed many; a private life hath profited many, and
exalted honour hath harmed many. And again, money hath profiled some,
honourable distinction hath profited some; profited them who use them
well; but from those who use them ill, the not withdrawing them hath
harmed them more. And so, Brethren, let us ask for those temporal
blessings too, but in moderation, being sure that if we do receive them,
He giveth them, who knoweth what is expedient for us. Thou hast asked,
and what thou hast asked, hath not been given thee? Trust thy Father,
who would give it thee, were it expedient for thee. Lo! judge in this
case by thine own self. For such as thy son who knows not the ways of
men is in regard to thee, such in regard to the Lord art thou thyself,
who knowest not the things of God. Lo, thy son cries a whole day before
thee, that thou wouldest give him a knife, or a sword; thou dost refuse
to give it him, thou wilt not give it, thou disregardest his tears, lest
thou shouldest have to bewail his death. Let him cry, and beat himself,
or throw himself upon the ground, that thou mayest set him on horseback;
thou wilt not do it, because he does not know how to govern the horse,
he may throw and kill him. To whom thou refusest a part, thou art
reserving the whole. But that he may grow up, and possess the whole in
safety, thou givest him not that little thing which is full of peril to
him.

<span id="vii.xxxii-p35"></span>8. And so, Brethren, we say, pray as
much as ye are able. Evils abound, and God hath willed that evils should
abound. Would that evil men did not abound, and then evils would not
abound. Bad times! troublesome times! this men are saying. Let our lives
be good; and the times are good. We make our times; such as we are, such
are the times. But what can we do? We cannot, it may be, convert the
mass of men to a good life. But let the few who do give ear live well;
let the few who live well endure the many who live ill. They are the
corn, they are in the floor; in the floor they can have the chaff with
them, they will not have them in the barn. Let them endure what they
would not, that they may come to what they would. Wherefore are we sad,
and blame we God? Evils abound in the world, in order that the world may
not engage our love. Great men, faithful saints were they who have
despised the world with all its attractions; <span
id="fr_2692"></span>[2693](#fn_2692.md) we are not able to despise it even
disfigured as it is. The world is evil, lo, it is evil, and yet it is
loved as though it were good. But what is this evil world? For the
heavens and the earth, and the waters, and the things that are therein,
the fish, and birds, and trees, are not evil. All these are good: but it
is evil men who make this evil world. Yet as we cannot be without evil
men, let us, as I have said, whilst we live pour out our groans before
the Lord our God, and endure the evils, that we may attain to the things
that are good. Let us not find fault with the Master of the household;
for He is loving to us. He beareth us, and not we him. He knoweth how to
govern what He made; do what He hath bidden, and hope for what He hath
promised.
