<span id="vii.xviii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xviii-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. xi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.xviii-p3.2"></span>,
“Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent by
his disciples, and said unto him, art thou He that cometh, or look we
for another?” etc.*

<span id="vii.xviii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xviii-p4.1"></span>The</span> lesson of the Holy Gospel has set
before us a question touching John the Baptist. May the Lord assist me
to resolve it to you, as He hath resolved it to us. John was commended,
as ye have heard, by the testimony of Christ, and in such terms
commended, as that there had not risen a greater among those who were
born of women. But a greater than he had been born of a Virgin. How much
greater? Let the herald himself declare, how great the difference is
between himself and his Judge, whose herald he is. For John went before
Christ both in his birth and preaching; but it was in obedience that he
went before Him; not in preferring himself before Him. For so the whole
train <span id="fr_2235"></span>[2236](#fn_2235.md) of attendants walks
before the judge; yet they who walk before, are really after him. How
signal a testimony then did John give to Christ? Even to saying that he
“was not worthy to loose the latchet of His shoes.” <span
id="fr_2236"></span>[2237](#fn_2236.md) And what more? “Of His fulness,”
saith he, “have all we received.” <span
id="fr_2237"></span>[2238](#fn_2237.md) He confessed that he was but a lamp
lighted at His Light, and so he took refuge at His feet, lest venturing
on high, he should be extinguished by the wind of pride. So great indeed
was he, that he was taken for Christ; and if he had not himself
testified that he was not He, the mistake would have continued, and he
would have been reputed to be the Christ. What striking humility! Honour
was proffered him by the people, and he himself refused it. Men were at
fault in his greatness, and he humbled himself. He had no wish to
increase by the words of men, seeing he had comprehended the Word of
God.

<span id="vii.xviii-p8"></span>2. This then did John say concerning
Christ. And what said Christ of John? We have just now heard. “He began
to say to the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the
wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?” <span
id="fr_2238"></span>[2239](#fn_2238.md) Surely not; for John was not “blown
about by every wind of doctrine.” <span
id="fr_2239"></span>[2240](#fn_2239.md) “But what went ye out for to see? A
man clothed in soft raiment?” <span id="fr_2240"></span>[2241](#fn_2240.md)
No, for John was clothed in rough apparel; he had his raiment of camel’s
hair, not of down. “But what went ye out for to see? A Prophet? yea, and
more than a Prophet.” <span id="fr_2241"></span>[2242](#fn_2241.md) Why
“more than a Prophet”? The Prophets foretold that the Lord would come,
whom they desired to see, and saw not; but to him was vouchsafed what
they sought. John saw the Lord; he saw Him, pointed his finger toward
Him, and said, “Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the
world;” <span id="fr_2242"></span>[2243](#fn_2242.md) behold, here He is.
Now had He come and was not acknowledged; and so a mistake was made also
as to John himself. Behold then here is He whom the Patriarchs desired
to see, whom the Prophets foretold, whom the Law prefigured. “Behold the
Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world.” And he gave a
goodly testimony to the Lord, and the Lord to him. “Among them that are
born of women,” saith the Lord, “there hath not risen a greater than
John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is less in the kingdom of
heaven is greater than he;” <span id="fr_2243"></span>[2244](#fn_2243.md)
less in time, but greater in majesty. This He said, meaning Himself to
be understood. Now exceedingly great among men is John the Baptist, than
whom among men Christ alone is greater. It may also <span
id="fr_2244"></span>[2245](#fn_2244.md) be thus stated and explained,
“Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than
John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is the least in the kingdom
of heaven is greater than he.” Not in the sense that I have before
explained it. “Notwithstanding, he that is the least in the kingdom of
heaven is greater than he;” the kingdom of heaven he meant where the
Angels are; he then that is the least among the Angels, is greater than
John. Thus He set forth to us the excellence <span
id="fr_2245"></span>[2246](#fn_2245.md) of that kingdom which we should
long for; set before us a city, of which we should desire to be
citizens. What sort of citizens are there? how great are they! Whoso is
the least there, is greater than John. Than what John? “Than whom there
hath not risen a greater among them that are born of women.”

<span id="vii.xviii-p17"></span>3. Thus have we heard the true and good
record both of John concerning Christ, and of Christ concerning John.
What then is the meaning of this; that John sent his disciples to Him
when He was shut up in prison, on the eve of being put to death, and
said to them, “Go, say to Him, Art Thou He that should come, or do we
look for another?” <span id="fr_2246"></span>[2247](#fn_2246.md) Is this
then all that praise? That praise is it turned to doubting? What sayest
thou, John. To Whom art thou speaking? What sayest thou? Thou speakest
to thy Judge, thyself the herald. Thou stretchedst out the finger, and
pointedst Him out; thou saidst, “Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who
taketh away the sins of the world.” Thou saidst, “Of His fulness have we
all received.” Thou saidst, “I am not worthy to unloose the latchet of
His shoes.” And dost <span id="page_310">p. 310</span> <span
id="vii.xviii-Page_310"></span>thou now say, “Art Thou He that should
come, or do we look for another?” Is not this the same Christ? And who
art thou? Art thou not His forerunner? Art thou not he of whom it was
foretold, “Behold, I send my messenger before Thy face, who shall
prepare Thy way before thee?” <span id="fr_2247"></span>[2248](#fn_2247.md)
How dost thou prepare the way, and thou art thyself straying from the
way? So then the disciples of John came; and the Lord said to them, “Go,
tell John, the blind see, the deaf hear, the lame walk, the lepers are
cleansed, the poor have the Gospel preached to them; and blessed is he
whosoever shall not be offended in Me.” <span
id="fr_2248"></span>[2249](#fn_2248.md) Do not suspect that John was
offended in Christ. And yet his words do sound so; “Art Thou He that
should come?” Ask my works; “The blind see, the deaf hear, the lame
walk, the lepers are cleansed, the dead are raised, the poor have the
Gospel preached to them;” and dost thou ask whether I am He? My works,
saith He, are My words. “Go, show him again. And as they departed.” Lest
haply any one should say, John was good at first, and the Spirit of God
forsook him; therefore after their departure, he spake these words;
after their departure whom John had sent, Christ commended John. <span
id="fr_2249"></span>[2250](#fn_2249.md)

<span id="vii.xviii-p22"></span>4. What is the meaning then of this
obscure question? May that Sun shine upon us, from which that lamp
derived its flame. And so the resolution of it is altogether plain. John
had separate disciples of his own; not as in separation from Christ, but
prepared as a witness to him. For meet it was that such an one should
give his testimony to Christ, who was himself also gathering disciples,
and who might have been envious of Him, for that he could not see Him.
Therefore because John’s disciples highly esteemed their master, they
heard from John his record concerning Christ, and marvelled; and as he
was about to die, it was his wish that they should be confirmed by him.
For no doubt they were saying among themselves; Such great things doth
he say of Him, but none such of himself. “Go then, ask Him;” not because
I doubt, but that ye may be instructed. “Go, ask Him,” hear from Himself
what I am in the habit of telling you; ye have heard the herald, be
confirmed by the Judge. “Go, ask Him, Art Thou He that should come, or
do we look for another?” They went accordingly and asked; not for John’s
sake, but for their own. And for their sakes did Christ say, “The blind
see, the lame walk, the deaf hear, the lepers are cleansed, the dead are
raised, the poor have the Gospel preached to them.” Ye see Me,
acknowledge Me then; ye see the works, acknowledge the Doer. “And
blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in Me.” But it is of you I
speak, not of John. For that we might know that He spake not this of
John, as they departed, “He began to speak to the multitudes concerning
John;” the True, the Truth Himself, proclaimed his true praises.

<span id="vii.xviii-p23"></span>5. I think this question has been
sufficiently explained. Let it suffice then to have prolonged my address
thus far. Now keep the poor in mind. Give, ye who have not given
hitherto; believe me, ye will not lose it. Yes, truly, that only it
seems ye lose, which ye do not carry to the circus. <span
id="fr_2250"></span>[2251](#fn_2250.md) Now must we render unto the poor
the offerings of such of you as have offered anything, and the amount
which we have is much less than your usual offerings. Shake off this
sloth. I am become a beggar for beggars; what is that to me? I would be
a beggar for beggars, that ye may be reckoned among the number of
children.
