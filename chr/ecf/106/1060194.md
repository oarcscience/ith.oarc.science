<span id="vi.vi.xvi-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Of the Consistency of the
Accounts Given by Matthew, Mark, and Luke on the Subject of the Parties
Who Insulted the Lord.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xvi-p2"></span>52. Matthew goes on in the following
strain: “And they that passed by reviled Him, wagging their heads, and
saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,
save thyself: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the
cross.” <span id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424) Mark’s statement
agrees with this almost to the letter. Then Matthew continues thus:
“Likewise also the chief priests, mocking Him, with the scribes and
elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save: if he be the King
of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe
him. He trusted in God; let Him deliver him now, if He will: for he
said, I am the Son of God.” <span id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425)
Mark and Luke, although they report the words differently, nevertheless
agree in conveying the same meaning, although the one passes without
notice something which the other mentions. <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426) For they are both really at one on
the subject of the chief priests, giving us to understand that they
insulted the Lord when He was crucified. The only difference is, that
Mark does not specify the elders, while Luke, who has instanced the
rulers, has not added the designation “of the priests,” and thus has
rather comprehended the whole body of the leading men under the general
designation; so that we may fairly take both the scribes and the elders
to be included in his description.
