id="vi.v.lxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXVIII.—Of the Withering of the
Fig-Tree, and of the Question as to the Absence of Any Contradiction
Between Mat</span><span id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span
id="vi.v.lxix-Page_160"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lxix-p1.2"></span>thew and the Other Evangelists in the
Accounts Given of that Incident, as Well as the Other Matters Related in
Connection with It; And Very Specially as to the Consistency Between
Matthew and Mark in the Matter of the Order of Narration.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxix-p2"></span>130. Matthew continues thus: “And the
blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them. And
when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that He did,
and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of
David, they were sore displeased, and said unto Him, Hearest thou what
these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of
the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise? And He left
them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and He lodged there. Now in
the morning, as He returned into the city, He hungered. And when He saw
a single <span id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138.md) fig-tree in the way,
He came to it, and found nothing thereon but leaves only, and said unto
it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the
fig-tree withered away. And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled,
saying, How soon is the fig-tree withered away! But Jesus answered and
said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not,
ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig-tree; but also, if ye
shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the
sea, it shall be done. And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in
prayer, believing, ye shall receive.” <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139.md)

<span id="vi.v.lxix-p5"></span>131. Mark also records this occurrence in
due succession. <span id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140.md) He does not,
however, follow the same order in his narrative. For first of all, the
fact which is related by Matthew, namely, that Jesus went into the
temple, and cast out those who sold and bought there, is not mentioned
at that point by Mark. On the other hand, Mark tells us that He looked
round about upon all things, and, when the eventide was now come, went
out into Bethany with the twelve. Next he informs us that on another
day, <span id="fr_1141"></span>[1142](#fn_1141.md) when they were coming
from Bethany, He was hungry, and cursed the fig-tree, as Matthew also
intimates. Then the said Mark subjoins the statement that He came into
Jerusalem, and that, on going into the temple, He cast out those who
sold and bought there, as if that incident took place not on the first
day specified, but on a different day. <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142.md) But inasmuch as Matthew puts the
connection in these terms, “And He left them, and went out of the city
into Bethany,” <span id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143.md) and tells us
that it was when returning in the morning into the city that He cursed
the tree, it is more reasonable to suppose that he, rather than Mark,
has preserved the strict order of time so far as regards the incident of
the expulsion of the sellers and buyers from the temple. For when he
uses the phrase, “And He left them, and went out,” who can be understood
by those parties whom He is thus said to have left, but those with whom
He was previously speaking,—namely, the persons who were so sore
displeased because the children cried out, “Hosanna to the Son of
David”? It follows, then, that Mark has omitted what took place on the
first day, when He went into the temple; and in mentioning that He found
nothing on the fig-tree but leaves, he has introduced what He called to
mind only there, but what really occurred on the second day, as both
evangelists testify. Then, further, his account bears that the
astonishment which the disciples expressed at finding how the fig-tree
had withered away, and the reply which the Lord made to them on the
subject of faith, and the casting of the mountain into the sea, belonged
not to this same second day on which He said to the tree, “No man eat
fruit of thee hereafter for ever,” but to a third day. For in connection
with the second day, the said Mark has recorded the incident of the
casting of the sellers out of the temple, which he had omitted to notice
as belonging to the first day. Accordingly, it is in connection with
this second day that he tells us how Jesus went out of the city, when
even was come, and how, when they passed by in the morning, the
disciples saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots, and how Peter,
calling to remembrance, said unto Him, “Master, behold the fig-tree
which Thou cursedst is withered away.” <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144.md) Then, too, he informs us that He
gave the answer relating to the power of faith. On the other hand,
Matthew recounts these matters in a manner importing that they all took
place on this second day; that is to say, both the word addressed to the
tree, “Let no fruit grow on thee from henceforward for ever,” and the
withering that ensued so speedily in the tree, and the reply which He
made on the subject of the power of faith to His disciples when they
observed that withering and marvelled at it. From this we are to
understand that Mark, on his side, has recorded in connection with the
second day what he had omitted to notice as occurring really on the
first,—namely, the incident of the expulsion of the sellers and buyers
from the temple. On the other hand, Matthew, after mentioning what was
done on the second day,—namely, the cursing of the fig-tree as He was
returning in the morning from Bethany into the city,—has omitted certain
facts which Mark has inserted, namely, His coming into the city, and His
going out of it in the evening, and the aston<span id="page_161">p.
161</span> <span id="vi.v.lxix-Page_161"></span>ishment which the
disciples expressed at finding the tree dried up as they passed by in
the morning; and then to what had taken place on the second day, which
was the day on which the tree was cursed, he has attached what really
took place on the third day,—namely, the amazement of the disciples at
seeing the tree’s withered condition, and the declaration which they
heard from the Lord on the subject of the power of faith. <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145.md) These several facts Matthew has
connected together in such a manner that, were we not compelled to turn
our attention to the matter by Mark’s narrative, we should be unable to
recognise either at what point or with regard to what circumstances the
former writer has left anything unrecorded in his narrative. The case
therefore stands thus: Matthew first presents the facts conveyed in
these words, “And He left them, and went out of the city into Bethany;
and He lodged there. Now in the morning, as He returned into the city,
He hungered; and when He saw a single fig-tree in the way, He came to
it, and found nothing thereon but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no
fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever; and presently the fig-tree
withered away.” Then, omitting the other matters which belonged to that
same day, he has immediately subjoined this statement, “And when the
disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is it withered away!”
although it was on another day that they saw this sight, and on another
day that they thus marvelled. But it is understood that the tree did not
wither at the precise time when they saw it, but presently when it was
cursed. For what they saw was not the tree in the process of drying up,
but the tree already dried completely up; and thus they learned that it
had withered away immediately on the Lord’s sentence.

blasted condition of the fig-tree was first noticed on the morning of
that day; these are the main points.—R.\]
