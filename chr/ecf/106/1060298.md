<span id="vii.lxxxi-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.lxxxi-p3.1"></span>*[John v.
39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md)<span id="vii.lxxxi-p3.2"></span>,
“Ye search the Scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal
life,” etc. Against the Donatists.*

<span id="vii.lxxxi-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.lxxxi-p4.1"></span>Give</span> heed, Beloved, to the lesson of
the Gospel which has just sounded in our ears, whilst I speak a few
words as God shall vouchsafe to me. The Lord Jesus was speaking to the
Jews, and said to them, “Search the Scriptures, in which ye think ye
have eternal life, they testify of me.” <span
id="fr_3851"></span>[3852](#fn_3851.md) Then a little after He said, “I am
come in My Father’s Name, and ye have not received Me; if another shall
come in his own name, him ye will receive.” <span
id="fr_3852"></span>[3853](#fn_3852.md) Then a little after; “How can ye
believe, who look for glory one from another, and seek not the glory
which is of God only?” <span id="fr_3853"></span>[3854](#fn_3853.md) At
last He saith, “I do not accuse you to the Father; there is one that
accuseth you, Moses, in whom ye trust. For had ye believed Moses, ye
would haply believe Me also, for he wrote of Me. But seeing ye believe
not his words, how can ye believe Me?” <span
id="fr_3854"></span>[3855](#fn_3854.md) At these sayings which have been
set before us from divine <span id="fr_3855"></span>[3856](#fn_3855.md)
inspiration, out of the reader’s mouth, but by the Saviour’s ministry,
give ear to a few words, not to be estimated by their number, but to be
duly weighed.

<span id="vii.lxxxi-p10"></span>2. For all these things it is easy to
understand as touching the Jews. But we must beware, lest, when we give
too much attention to them, we withdraw our eyes from ourselves. For the
Lord was speaking to His disciples; and assuredly what He spake to them,
He spake to us too their posterity. Nor to them only does what He said,
“Lo, I am with you alway even unto the end of the world,” <span
id="fr_3856"></span>[3857](#fn_3856.md) apply, but even to all Christians
that should be after them, and succeed them even unto the end of the
world. Speaking then to them He said, “Beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees.” <span id="fr_3857"></span>[3858](#fn_3857.md) They at that time
thought that the Lord had said this, because they had brought no bread;
they did not understand that “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees”
meant, “beware of the doctrine of the Pharisees.” What was the doctrine
of the Pharisees, but that which ye have now heard? “Seeking glory one
of another, looking for glory one from another, and not seeking the
glory which is of God only.” Of these the Apostle Paul thus speaks; “I
bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to
knowledge.” <span id="fr_3858"></span>[3859](#fn_3858.md) “They have,” he
says, “a zeal of God;” I know it, I am sure of it; I was once among
them, I was such as they. “They have,” he says, “a zeal of God, but not
according to knowledge.” What is this, O Apostle, “not according to
knowledge”? Explain to us what the knowledge is thou dost set forth,
which thou dost grieve is not in them, and wouldest should be in us? He
went on and subjoined and developed what he had set forth closed. What
is, “They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge? For they
being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and wishing to establish their
own, have not submitted themselves into the righteousness of God.” <span
id="fr_3859"></span>[3860](#fn_3859.md) To be ignorant then of God’s
righteousness, and to wish to establish one’s own, this is to “look for
glory one from another, and not to seek the glory which is of God only.”
This is the leaven of the Pharisees. Of this the Lord bids beware. If it
is servants that He bids, and the Lord that bids, let us beware; lest we
hear, “Why say ye to Me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
say?” <span id="fr_3860"></span>[3861](#fn_3860.md)

<span id="vii.lxxxi-p16"></span>3. Let us then leave a while the Jews to
whom the Lord was then speaking. They are without, they will not listen
to us, they hate the Gospel itself, they procured false witness against
the Lord, that they might condemn Him when alive; other witness they
bought with money against Him when dead. When we say to them, “Believe
on Jesus,” they answer us, “Are we to believe on a dead man?” But when
we add, “But He rose again;” they answer, “Not  <span
id="fr_3861"></span>[3862](#fn_3861.md) at all;” His disciples stole Him
away from the sepulchre. The Jewish buyers love falsehood and despise
the truth of the Lord, the Redeemer. What thou art saying, O Jew, thy
parents bought for money; and this which they bought hath continued in
thee. Give heed rather to Him That bought thee, not to him who bought a
lie for thee.

<span id="vii.lxxxi-p18"></span>4. But as I have said, let us leave
these, and attend rather to these our brethren, with whom we have to do.
For Christ is the Head of the Body. The Head is in Heaven, the Body is
on earth; the Head is the Lord, the Body His Church. But ye remember it
is said, “They shall be two in one flesh.” “This is a great
mystery,” <span id="fr_3862"></span>[3863](#fn_3862.md) says the Apostle,
“but I speak in Christ and in the Church.” <span
id="fr_3863"></span>[3864](#fn_3863.md) If then they are two in one flesh,
they are two in one voice. Our Head the Lord Christ spake to the Jews
these things which we heard, when the Gospel was being read, The Head to
His enemies; let the Body too, that is, the Church, speak to its
enemies. Ye know to whom it should speak. What has it to say? It is not
of myself that I have said, that the voice is one; because the flesh is
one, the voice is one. Let us then say this to them; I am speaking with
the voice of the Church. “O Brethren, dispersed children, wandering
sheep, branches <span id="page_497">p. 497</span> <span
id="vii.lxxxi-Page_497"></span>cut off, why do ye calumniate me? Why do
ye not acknowledge me? “Search the Scriptures, in which ye think ye have
eternal life, they testify of me;” to the Jews our Head saith, what the
Body saith to you; “Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me.” <span
id="fr_3864"></span>[3865](#fn_3864.md) Why? Because ye do not “search the
Scriptures, which testify of me.”

<span id="vii.lxxxi-p22"></span>5. A testimony for the Head; “To Abraham
and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of
many, but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.” <span
id="fr_3865"></span>[3866](#fn_3865.md) A testimony for the body unto
Abraham, which the Apostle hath brought forward. “To Abraham were the
promises made. As I live, saith the Lord, I swear by Myself, because
thou hast obeyed My Voice, and hast not spared thine own beloved son for
Me, that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand of the sea,
and in thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed.” <span
id="fr_3866"></span>[3867](#fn_3866.md) Thou hast here a testimony for the
Head, and one for the Body. Hear another, short, and almost in one
sentence including a testimony for the Head and for the Body. The Psalm
was speaking of the Resurrection of Christ; “Be Thou exalted, O God,
above the heavens.” <span id="fr_3867"></span>[3868](#fn_3867.md) And
immediately for the Body; “And Thy glory above all the earth.” Hear a
testimony for the Head; “They digged My Hands and My Feet, they numbered
all My Bones; and they looked and stared upon Me; they divided My
garments among them, and cast lots upon My vesture.” <span
id="fr_3868"></span>[3869](#fn_3868.md) Hear immediately a testimony for
the Body, a few words after, “All the ends of the world shall remember
themselves and be turned unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the
nations shall worship in His sight; for the kingdom is the Lord’s, and
He shall have dominion over the nations.” <span
id="fr_3869"></span>[3870](#fn_3869.md) Hear for the Head; And “He is as a
bridegroom coming forth out of His bride-chamber.” <span
id="fr_3870"></span>[3871](#fn_3870.md) And in this same Psalm hear for the
Body; “Their sound went out into all the earth, and their words unto the
ends of the world.” <span id="fr_3871"></span>[3872](#fn_3871.md)

<span id="vii.lxxxi-p30"></span>6. These passages are for the Jews, and
for these of our own brethren. Why so? Because these Scriptures of the
Old Testament both the Jews receive, and these our brethren receive. But
Christ Himself, whom the others do not receive, let us see if these last
receive. Let Him speak Himself, speak both for Himself who is the Head,
and for His Body which is the Church; for so in us the head speaks for
the body. Hear for the Head; He was risen from the dead, He found the
disciples hesitating, doubting, not believing for joy; He “opened their
understanding that they might understand the Scriptures, and said to
them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to
rise again from the dead the third day.” Thus for the Head; let Him
speak for the Body too; “And that repentance and remission of sins
should be preached in His Name throughout all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem.” <span id="fr_3872"></span>[3873](#fn_3872.md) Let the Church
then speak to her enemies, let her speak. She does speak clearly, she is
not silent: only let them give ear. Brethren, ye have heard the
testimonies, now acknowledge me. “Search the Scriptures, in which ye
hope ye have eternal life: they testify of me.” What I have said is not
of mine own, but of my Lord’s; and notwithstanding, ye still turn away,
still turn your backs. “How can ye believe me, who look for glory one
from another, and seek not the glory which is of God only? For being
ignorant of God’s righteousness, ye have a zeal of God, but not
according to knowledge. For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and
wishing to establish your own, ye have not submitted yourselves to the
righteousness of God.” <span id="fr_3873"></span>[3874](#fn_3873.md) What
else is it to be ignorant of God’s righteousness, and to wish to
establish your own, but to say, “It is I who sanctify, it is I who
justify; what I may have given is holy”? Leave to God what is God’s;
recognise, O man, what is man’s. Thou art ignorant of God’s
righteousness, and wishest to establish thine own. Thou dost wish to
justify me; it is enough for thee that thou be justified with me.

<span id="vii.lxxxi-p33"></span>7. It is said of Antichrist, and all
understand of him what the Lord said, “I am come in My Father’s Name,
and ye have not received Me; if another shall come in his own name, him
ye will receive.” <span id="fr_3874"></span>[3875](#fn_3874.md) But let us
hear John too; “Ye have heard that Antichrist cometh, and even now are
there many Antichrists.” <span id="fr_3875"></span>[3876](#fn_3875.md) What
is it in Antichrist that we are in horror of, but that he is to honour
his own name, and to despise the Name of the Lord? What else doeth he
that saith, “It is I that justify”? We answer him, “I came to Christ,
not with my feet, but with my heart I came; where I heard the Gospel,
there did I believe, there was I baptized; because I believed on Christ,
I believed on God.” Yet says he, “Thou art not clean.” “Why?” “Because I
was not there.” “Tell me why am not I cleansed, a man who was baptized
in Jerusalem, who was baptized, for instance, among the Ephesians, to
whom an Epistle you read was written, and whose peace you despise? Lo,
to the Ephesians the Apostle wrote; a Church was founded, and remains
even to this day; yea, remains in greater fruitfulness, remains in
greater numbers, holds fast that which it received of the Apostle, ‘If
any man preach ought to you than <span id="page_498">p. 498</span> <span
id="vii.lxxxi-Page_498"></span>that ye have received, let him be
accursed.’  <span id="fr_3876"></span>[3877](#fn_3876.md) What now? what
dost thou say to me? Am I not clean? There was I baptized, am I not
clean?” “No, even thou art not.” “Why?” “Because I was not there.” “But
He who is everywhere was there. He who is everywhere was there, in whose
Name I believed. Thou coming I know not whence, yea, rather not coming,
but wishing that I should come to thee, fixed in this place, sayest to
me, ‘Thou wast not baptized duly, seeing I was not there.’ Consider who
was there. What was said to John? ‘Upon whom thou shall see the Spirit
descending like a dove, this is He which baptizeth.’ <span
id="fr_3877"></span>[3878](#fn_3877.md) Him hast thou seeking for thee;
nay, for that thou hast grudged me who was baptized by Him, thou hast
lost Him rather.”

<span id="vii.lxxxi-p38"></span>8. Understand then, my Brethren, our
language and theirs, and look which ye would choose. This is what we
say; “Be we holy, God knoweth it; be we unrighteous, this again He
knoweth better; place not your hope in us, whatsoever we be. If we be
good, do as is written, ‘Be ye imitators of me, as I also am of
Christ.’ <span id="fr_3878"></span>[3879](#fn_3878.md) But if we be bad,
not even thus are ye abandoned, not even thus have ye remained without
counsel: give ear to Him, saying, ‘Do what they say; but do not what
they do.’” <span id="fr_3879"></span>[3880](#fn_3879.md) Whereas they on
the contrary say, “If we were not good, ye were lost.” Lo, here is
“another that shall come in his own name.” Shall my life then depend on
thee, and my salvation be tied up in thee? Have I so forgotten my
foundation? Was not Christ the Rock? <span
id="fr_3880"></span>[3881](#fn_3880.md) Is it not that he that buildeth
upon the rock, neither the wind nor the floods overthrow him? <span
id="fr_3881"></span>[3882](#fn_3881.md) Come then, if thou wilt, with me
upon the Rock, and do not wish to be to me for the rock.

<span id="vii.lxxxi-p43"></span>9. Let the Church then say those last
words also, “If ye had believed Moses, ye would believe me also; for he
wrote of me;” <span id="fr_3882"></span>[3883](#fn_3882.md) for that I am
His body of whom he wrote. And of the Church did Moses write. For I have
quoted the words of Moses “In thy seed shall all nations of the earth be
blessed.” <span id="fr_3883"></span>[3884](#fn_3883.md) Moses wrote this in
the first book. If ye believed Moses, ye would also believe Christ.
Because ye despise Moses’ words, it must needs be that ye despise the
words of Christ. “They have” there, saith He, “Moses and the Prophets,
let them hear them. Nay, father Abraham, but if one went unto them from
the dead,” him they will hear. “And He said, If they hear not Moses and
the Prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the
dead.”  <span id="fr_3884"></span>[3885](#fn_3884.md) This was said of the
Jews: was it therefore not said of heretics? He had risen from the dead,
who said, “It behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead
the third day.” This I believe. I believe it, he says. Dost thou
believe? Wherefore believest thou not what follows? In that thou
believest, “It behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead
the third day;” this was spoken of the Head; believe also that which
follows concerning the Church, “That repentance and remission of sins
should be preached throughout all nations.” <span
id="fr_3885"></span>[3886](#fn_3885.md) Wherefore dost thou believe as
touching the Head, and believest not as touching the Body? What hath the
Church done to thee, that thou wouldest so to say behead her? Thou
wouldest take away the Church’s Head, and believe the Head, leave the
Body as it were a lifeless trunk. It is all to no purpose that thou dost
caress the Head, like any devoted servant. He that would take off the
head, doth his best to kill both the head and the body. They are ashamed
to deny Christ, yet are they not ashamed to deny Christ’s words. Christ
neither we nor ye have seen with our eyes. The Jews saw, and slew Him.
We have not seen Him, and believe; His words are with us. Compare
yourselves with the Jews: they despised Him hanging upon the Tree, ye
despise Him sitting in heaven; at their suggestion Christ’s title was
set <span id="fr_3886"></span>[3887](#fn_3886.md) up, by your setting <span
id="fr_3887"></span>[3888](#fn_3887.md) yourselves up, Christ’s Baptism is
effaced. But what remains, Brethren, but that we pray even for the
proud, that we pray even for the puffed up, who so extol themselves? Let
us say to God on their behalf, “Let them know that the Lord is Thy Name;
and” not “that” men, but “Thou Only art the Most High over all the
earth.” <span id="fr_3888"></span>[3889](#fn_3888.md) Let us turn to the
Lord, etc.
