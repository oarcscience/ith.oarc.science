<span id="vi.vii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.—Of the Question Regarding the
Proof that Mark’s Gospel is in Harmony with the Rest in What is Narrated
(Those Passages Which He Has in Common with Matthew Being Left Out of
Account), from Its Beginning Down to the Section Where It is Said, “And
They Go into Capharnaum, and Straightway on the Sabbath-Day He Taught
Them:” Which Incident is Reported Also by Luke.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p2"></span>2. Mark, then, commences as follows: “The
beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God: as it is
written in the prophet Isaiah;” and so on, down to where it is said,
“And they go into Capharnaum; and straightway on the Sabbath-day He
entered into the synagogue and taught them.” <span
id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586.md) In this entire context, everything
has been examined above in connection with Matthew. This particular
statement, however, about His going into the synagogue at Capharnaum and
teaching them on the Sabbath-day, is one which Mark has in common with
Luke. <span id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587.md) But it raises no
question of difficulty.
