<p class="c22"><a name="vi.iv.i-p2"></A>1. <span class="c13"><a name="vi.iv.i-p2.1"></A>In</span> the entire number of those divine records which are contained in the sacred writings, the gospel deservedly stands pre-eminent. For what the law and the prophets aforetime announced as destined to come to pass, is exhibited in the gospel in its realization&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_497"><FONT SIZE="1">498</FONT></A>
 and fulfilment. The first preachers of this gospel were the apostles, who beheld our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in person when He was yet present in the flesh. And not only did these&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">499</FONT></A>
 men keep in remembrance the words heard from His lips, and the deeds wrought by Him beneath their eyes; but they were also careful, when the duty of preaching the gospel was laid upon them, to make mankind acquainted with those divine and memorable occurrences which took place at a period antecedent to the formation of their own connection with Him in the way of discipleship, which belonged also to the time of His nativity, His infancy, or His youth, and with regard to which 				they were able to institute exact inquiry and to obtain information, either at His own hand or at the hands of His parents or other parties, on the ground of the most reliable intimations and the most trustworthy testimonies. Certain of them also&#8212;namely, Matthew and John&#8212;gave to the world, in their respective books, a written account of all those matters which it seemed needful to commit to writing concerning Him.</p>  			 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.iv.i-p5"></A>2. And to preclude the supposition that, in what concerns the apprehension and proclamation of the gospel, it is a matter of any consequence whether the enunciation comes by men who were actual followers of this same Lord here <A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.i-Page_78"></A>when He manifested Himself in the flesh and had the company of His disciples attendant on Him, or by persons who with due credit received facts with which they became acquainted in a trustworthy manner through the instrumentality 				of these former, divine providence, through the agency of the Holy Spirit, has taken care that certain of those also who were nothing more than followers of the first apostles should have authority given them not only to preach the gospel, but also to compose an account of it in writing. I refer to Mark and Luke. All those other individuals, however, who have attempted or dared to offer a written record of the acts of the Lord or of the apostles, failed to commend themselves in their own times 				as men of the character which would induce the Church to yield them its confidence, and to admit their compositions to the canonical authority of the Holy Books. And this was the case not merely because they were persons who could make no rightful claim to have credit given them in their narrations, but also because in a deceitful manner they introduced into their writings certain matters which are condemned at once by the catholic and apostolic rule of faith, and by sound doctrine.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">500</FONT></A>
