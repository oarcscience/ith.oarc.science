<span id="vii.x-p3"></span>*Again on the Lord’s Prayer,* [Matt.
6.5-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005.md)<span id="vii.x-p3.1"></span>*.
To the Competentes.*

<span id="vii.x-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.x-p4.1"></span>You</span> have just repeated the Creed, where in
brief summary is contained the Faith. I have already before now told you
what the Apostle Paul says, “How shall they call on Him in whom they
have not believed?” <span id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031.md) Because
then you have both heard, and learnt, and repeated how you must believe
in God; hear to-day how He must be called upon. The Son Himself, as you
heard when the Gospel was read, taught His disciples and His faithful
ones this Prayer. Good hope have we of obtaining our cause, when such an
Advocate <span id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032.md) hath dictated our
suit. The Assessor of the Father, as you have confessed, who sitteth on
the right hand of the Father; He is our Advocate who is to be our Judge.
For from thence will He come to judge the quick and dead. Learn then,
this Prayer also which you will have to repeat in eight days time. But
whosoever of you have not repeated the Creed well, have yet time enough,
let them learn it; because on the Sabbath day <span
id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033.md) in the hearing of all who shall be
present, you will have to repeat it: on the last <span
id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034.md) Sabbath day, when you will be here
to be baptized. But in eight days from to-day will you have to repeat
this Prayer, which you have heard to-day.

<span id="vii.x-p9"></span>2. Of which the first clause is, “Our Father,
which art in heaven.” <span id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035.md) We have
found then a Father in heaven; let us take good heed how we live on
earth. For he who hath found such a Father, ought so to live that he may
be worthy to come to his inheritance. But we say all in common, “Our
Father.” How great a condescension! This the emperor says, and this says
the beggar: this says the slave, and this his lord. <span
id="page_285">p. 285</span> <span id="vii.x-Page_285"></span>They say
all together, “Our Father, which art in heaven.” Therefore do they
understand that they are brethren, seeing they have one Father. Now let
not the lord disdain to have his slave for a brother, seeing the Lord
Christ has vouch-safed to have him for a brother.

<span id="vii.x-p11"></span>3. “Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy kingdom
come.” <span id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036.md) This hallowing of
God’s Name is that whereby we are made holy. For His Name is always
Holy. We wish also for His kingdom to come; come it will, though we wish
it not; but to wish and pray that His kingdom may come, is nothing else
than to wish of Him, that He would make us worthy of His kingdom, lest
haply, which God forbid, it should come, and not come to us. For to many
that will never come, which nevertheless must come. For to them will it
come, to whom it shall be said, “Come, ye blessed of My Father, receive
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” <span
id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037.md) But it will not come to them to
whom it shall be said, “Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting
fire.” <span id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038.md) Therefore when we say,
“Thy kingdom come,” we pray that it may come to us. What is, “may come
to us”? May find us good. This we pray for then, that He would make us
good; for then to us will His kingdom come.

<span id="vii.x-p15"></span>4. We go on, “Thy will be done as in heaven
so in earth.” <span id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039.md) The Angels
serve Thee in heaven, may we serve Thee in earth! The Angels do not
offend Thee in heaven, may we not offend Thee in earth! As they do Thy
will, so may we do it also! And here what do we pray for, but that we
may be good? For when we do God’s will (for He without doubt doeth His
own will), then is His will done in us. And we may understand in another
and a right sense these words, “Thy will be done as in heaven, so in
earth.” We receive the commandment of God, and it is well-pleasing to
us, well-pleasing to our mind. “For we delight in the law of God after
the inward man.” <span id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040.md) Then is His
will done in heaven. For our spirit is compared to heaven, but to the
earth our flesh. What then is “Thy will be done as in heaven, so in
earth”? That as Thy command is well-pleasing to our mind, so may our
flesh consent thereto; and so that strife be ended which is described by
the Apostle, “for the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
against the flesh.” <span id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041.md) When the
Spirit lusteth against the flesh, His will is even now done in heaven;
when the flesh lusteth not against the Spirit, His will is now done in
earth. There will be harmony complete when He will; be then the contest
now, that there may be victory hereafter. Thus again, “Thy will be done
as in heaven, so in earth,” may be well understood, by making “heaven”
to be the Church, because it is the throne <span
id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042.md) of God; and “earth” the
unbelievers, to whom it is said, “Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt
thou go.” <span id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043.md) When therefore we
pray for our enemies, for the enemies of the Church, the enemies of the
Christian name, we pray that His will may be done “as in heaven, so in
earth,” that is, as in Thy faithful ones, so in Thy blasphemers also,
that they all may become “heaven.”

<span id="vii.x-p21"></span>5. There follows next, “Give us this day our
daily bread.” <span id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044.md) It may be
understood simply that we pour forth this prayer for daily sustenance,
that we may have abundance: or if not that, that we may have no want.
Now he said “daily,” for as long as it is called “to-day.” <span
id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045.md) Daily we live, and daily rise, and
are daily fed, and daily hunger. May He then give us daily bread. Why
did He not say “covering” too, for the support of our life is in meat
and drink, our covering in raiment and lodging. Man should desire
nothing more than these. Forasmuch as the Apostle saith, “We brought
nothing into this world, neither can we carry anything out: having food
and covering, <span id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046.md) let us be
therewith content.” <span id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047.md) Perish
covetousness, and nature is rich. Therefore if this prayer have
reference to our daily sustenance, since this is a good understanding of
the words, “Give us this day our daily bread;” let us not marvel, if
under the name of bread other necessary things are also understood. As
when Joseph invited his brethren, “These men,” saith he, “will eat bread
with me to-day.” <span id="fr_2048"></span>[2049](#fn_2048.md) Why, were
they to eat bread only? No, but in the mention of bread only, all the
rest was understood. So when we pray for daily bread, we ask for
whatever is necessary for us in earth for our bodies’ sake. But what
saith the Lord Jesus? “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His
righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.” <span
id="fr_2049"></span>[2050](#fn_2049.md) Again, this is a very good sense
of, “Give us this day our daily bread,” thy Eucharist, our daily food.
For the faithful know what they receive, and good for them it is to
receive that daily bread which is necessary for this time present. They
pray then for themselves, that they may become good, that they may
persevere in goodness, and faith, and a holy life. This do they wish,
this they pray for; for if they persevere not in this good life, they
will be separated from that Bread. Therefore, “Give us this day our
daily bread.” What is this? Let us live so,that we be not separated from
Thy altar. Again, the Word of God which is laid open to us, and in a
manner broken day by day, is “daily bread.” And as our bodies hunger
after that other, so do our souls after this bread. And so we both ask
for this bread simply, and whatsoever is in this <span id="page_286">p.
286</span> <span id="vii.x-Page_286"></span>life needful both for our
souls and bodies, is included in “daily bread.”

<span id="vii.x-p28"></span>6. “Forgive us our debts,” <span
id="fr_2050"></span>[2051](#fn_2050.md) we say, and we may well say so; for
we say the truth. For who is he that lives here in the flesh, and hath
no debts? What man is there that lives so, that this prayer is not
necessary for him? He may puff himself up, justify himself he cannot. It
were well for him to imitate the Publican, and not swell as the
Pharisee, “who went up into the temple,” <span
id="fr_2051"></span>[2052](#fn_2051.md) and boasted of his deserts, and
covered up his wounds. Whereas he who said, “Lord, be merciful to me a
sinner,” <span id="fr_2052"></span>[2053](#fn_2052.md) knew wherefore he
went up. This prayer the Lord Jesus, consider, my brethren, this prayer
the Lord Jesus taught His disciples to offer, those great first Apostles
of His, the leaders of our flock. <span
id="fr_2053"></span>[2054](#fn_2053.md) If the leaders of the flock then
pray for the remission of their sins, what ought the lambs to do, of
whom it is said, “Bring young rams unto the Lord”? <span
id="fr_2054"></span>[2055](#fn_2054.md) You knew then that you have
repeated this in the Creed, because amongst the rest you have mentioned
there “the remission of sins.” There is one remission of sins which is
given once for all; another which is given day by day. There is one
remission of sins which is given once for all in Holy Baptism; another
which is given as long as we live here in the Lord’s Prayer. Wherefore
we say, “Forgive us our debts.”

<span id="vii.x-p34"></span>7. And God has brought us into a covenant,
and agreement, and a firm bond <span
id="fr_2055"></span>[2056](#fn_2055.md) with Him, in that we say, “as we
also forgive our debtors.” He who would say it effectually, “Forgive us
our debts,” must say truly, “as we also forgive our debtors.” <span
id="fr_2056"></span>[2057](#fn_2056.md) If this which is last he either say
not, or say deceitfully, the other which is first he says in vain. We
say to you then especially who are approaching to Holy Baptism, from
your hearts forgive everything. And ye faithful, who taking advantage of
this occasion are listening to this prayer, and our exposition of it, do
ye wholly and from your hearts forgive whatsoever ye have against any.
Forgive it there where God seeth. For sometimes a man remitteth with the
mouth, and in the heart retaineth; he remitteth with the mouth for men’s
sake, and retaineth in the heart, as not fearing the eyes of God. But do
ye remit entirely. Whatever ye have retained up to these holy
days, <span id="fr_2057"></span>[2058](#fn_2057.md) in these holy days at
least remit. “The sun ought not to go down upon your wrath,” <span
id="fr_2058"></span>[2059](#fn_2058.md) yet many suns have passed. Let then
your wrath at length pass away also, now that we are celebrating the
days of the great Sun, of that Sun of which Scripture saith, “Unto you
shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings.” <span
id="fr_2059"></span>[2060](#fn_2059.md) What is, “in His wings”? In His
protection. Whence it is said in the Psalms, “Keep me under the shadow
of Thy wings.” <span id="fr_2060"></span>[2061](#fn_2060.md) But as to
others who in the day of judgment shall repent, but all too late, and
who shall mourn, yet unavailingly, it hath been foretold by Wisdom what
they shall then say as they repent and groan for anguish of spirit,
“What hath pride profited us, or what good hath riches with our vaunting
brought us? All these things are passed away like a shadow.” And,
“Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of
righteousness hath not shined unto us, and the Sun of righteousness rose
not upon us.” <span id="fr_2061"></span>[2062](#fn_2061.md) That Sun riseth
upon the righteous only; but this sun which we see, God “maketh,” daily
“to rise upon the good and evil.” <span
id="fr_2062"></span>[2063](#fn_2062.md) The righteous attain to the seeing
of that Sun; and that Sun dwelleth now in our hearts by faith. If then
thou art angry, let not this sun go down in thine heart upon thy wrath;
“Let not the sun go down upon thy wrath;” lest haply thou be angry, and
so the Sun of righteousness go down upon thee, and thou abide in
darkness.

<span id="vii.x-p43"></span>8. Now do not think that anger is nothing.
“Mine eye was disordered because of anger,” <span
id="fr_2063"></span>[2064](#fn_2063.md) saith the Prophet. Surely he whose
eye is disordered cannot see the sun; and if he should try to see it, it
were pain, and no pleasure to him. And what is anger? The lust of
vengeance. A man lusteth to be avenged, and Christ is not yet avenged,
the holy martyrs are not yet avenged. Still doth the patience of God
wait, that the enemies of Christ, the enemies of the martyrs, may be
converted. And who are we, that we should seek for vengeance? If God
should seek it at our hands, where should we abide? He who hath never in
any matter done us harm, doth not wish to avenge Himself of us; and do
we seek to be avenged, who are almost daily offending God? Forgive
therefore; from the heart forgive. If thou art angry, yet sin not. “Be
ye angry, and sin not.” <span id="fr_2064"></span>[2065](#fn_2064.md) Be ye
angry as being but men, if so be ye are overcome by it; yet sin not, so
as to retain anger in your heart (for if ye do retain it, ye retain it
against yourselves), lest ye enter not into that Light. Therefore
forgive. What then is anger? The lust of vengeance. And what is hatred?
Inveterate anger. If anger become inveterate, it is then called hatred.
And this he seems to acknowledge, who when he had said, “Mine eye is
disordered because of anger;” added, “I have become inveterate among all
mine enemies.” <span id="fr_2065"></span>[2066](#fn_2065.md) What was anger
when it was <span id="page_287">p. 287</span> <span
id="vii.x-Page_287"></span>new, became hatred when it was turned into
long continuance. <span id="fr_2066"></span>[2067](#fn_2066.md) Anger is a
“mote,” hatred, a “beam.” We sometimes find fault with one who is angry,
yet we retain hatred in our own hearts; and so Christ saith to us, “Thou
seest the mote in thy brother’s eye, and seest not the beam in thine own
eye.” <span id="fr_2067"></span>[2068](#fn_2067.md) How grew the mote into
a beam? Because it was not at once plucked out. Because thou didst
suffer the sun to rise and go down so often upon thy wrath, and madest
it inveterate, because thou contractedst evil suspicions, and wateredst
the mote, and by watering hast nourished it, and by nourishing it, hast
made it a beam. Tremble then at least when it is said, “Whosoever hateth
his brother is a murderer.” <span id="fr_2068"></span>[2069](#fn_2068.md)
Thou hast not drawn the sword, nor inflicted any bodily wound, nor by
any blow killed another; the thought only of hatred is in thy heart, and
hereby art thou held to be a murderer, guilty art thou before the eyes
of God. The other man is alive, and yet thou hast killed him. As far as
thou art concerned, thou hast killed the man whom thou hatest. Reform
then, and amend thyself. If scorpions or adders were in your houses, how
would ye toil to purify them, that ye might be able to dwell in safety?
Yet are ye angry, yea inveterate anger is in your hearts, and there grow
so many hatreds, so many beams, so many scorpions, so many vipers, and
will ye not then purify the house of God, your heart? Do then what is
said, “As we also forgive our debtors;” and so say securely, “Forgive us
our debts.” For without debts in this earth ye cannot live; but those
great crimes which it is your blessing to have been forgiven in Baptism,
and from which we ought to be ever free, are of one sort, and of another
are those daily sins, without which a man cannot live in this world, by
reason of which this daily prayer with its covenant and agreement is
necessary; that as we say with all cheerfulness, “Forgive us our debts;”
so we may say with all truth, “As we also forgive our debtors.” So much
then have we said as touching past sins; what now for the future?

<span id="vii.x-p50"></span>9. “Lead us not into temptation:” <span
id="fr_2069"></span>[2070](#fn_2069.md) forgive what we have done already,
and grant that we may not commit any more sins. For whosoever is
overcome by temptation, committeth sin. Thus the Apostle James saith,
“Let no man say when he is tempted, he is tempted of God, for God cannot
be tempted with evil, neither tempteth He any man. But every man is
tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then lust,
when it hath conceived, bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is
finished, bringeth forth death.”  <span
id="fr_2070"></span>[2071](#fn_2070.md) Therefore that thou be not drawn
away by thy lust; consent not to it. It hath no means of conceiving, but
by thee. Thou hast consented, hast as it were in thine heart
admitted <span id="fr_2071"></span>[2072](#fn_2071.md) her embrace. Lust
has risen up, deny thyself to her, follow her not. It is a lust
unlawful, impure, and shameful, it will alienate thee from God. Give it
not then the embrace of thy consent, lest thou have to bewail the birth;
for if thou consent, that is, when thou hast embraced her, she
conceives, “and when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.” Dost
thou not yet fear? “Sin bringeth forth death;” at least, fear death. If
thou fear not sin, yet fear that whereunto it leads. Sin is sweet; but
death is bitter. This is the infelicity of men; that for which they sin,
they leave here when they die, and the sin themselves they carry with
them. Thou dost sin for money, it must be left here: or for a country
seat; it must be left here: or for some woman’s sake; she must be left
here; and whatsoever it be for which thou dost sin, when thou shalt have
closed thine eyes in death, thou must leave it here; yet the sin itself
which thou committest, thou carriest with thee.

<span id="vii.x-p54"></span>10. May sins then be forgiven; the past
forgiven, and the future cease. But without them here below thou canst
not live; be they either lesser sins, or small, or trivial. Yet let not
even these small and trivial sins be despised. With little drops is the
river filled. Let not even the lesser sins be despised. Through narrow
chinks in the ship the water oozes in, <span
id="fr_2072"></span>[2073](#fn_2072.md) the hold keeps filling, and if it
be disregarded the ship is sunk. But the sailors are not idle; their
hands are active, <span id="fr_2073"></span>[2074](#fn_2073.md) —active
that the water may be drained off from day to day. So be thy hands
active, that thou mayest pump from day to day. What is the meaning of
“be thy hands active”? Let them give, do good works, so be thy hands
engaged. “Break thy bread to the hungry, and bring the poor and
houseless into thine house; if thou seest the naked, clothe him.” <span
id="fr_2074"></span>[2075](#fn_2074.md) Do all thou canst, do it with the
means thou canst command, do it cheerfully, and so put up thy prayer
with confidence. It will have two wings, a double alms. What is “a
double alms”? “Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven. Give, and it shall be
given unto you.” <span id="fr_2075"></span>[2076](#fn_2075.md) The one alms
is that which is done from the heart, when thou forgivest thy brother
his sin. The other alms is that which is done out of thy substance, when
thou dealest bread to the poor. Offer both, lest without either wing thy
prayer remain motionless.

<span id="vii.x-p59"></span>11. Therefore when we have said, “Lead us
not into temptation,” there follows, “But deliver us from evil.” Now
whoso wishes to be delivered from evil, bears witness that he is in
evil. And thus saith the Apostle, “Redeeming <span id="page_288">p.
288</span> <span id="vii.x-Page_288"></span>the time, because the days
are evil.” <span id="fr_2076"></span>[2077](#fn_2076.md) But who is there
“that wisheth for life, and loveth to see good days”? <span
id="fr_2077"></span>[2078](#fn_2077.md) Seeing that all men in this flesh
have only evil days; who doth not wish it? Do thou what follows, “Keep
thy tongue from evil, and thy lips that they speak no guile: depart from
evil, and do good, seek peace, and ensue it;” <span
id="fr_2078"></span>[2079](#fn_2078.md) and then thou hast got rid of evil
days, and thy prayer, “deliver us from evil,” is fulfilled.

<span id="vii.x-p63"></span>12. Therefore the three first petitions,
“Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done as in heaven,
so in earth,” are for eternity. But the four following relate to this
life, “Give us this day our daily bread.” Shall we ask day by day for
daily bread, when we shall have come to that fulness of blessing?
“Forgive us our debts.” Shall we say this in that kingdom, when we shall
have no debts? “Lead us not into temptation.” Shall we be able to say
this then, when there will be no temptation? “Deliver us from evil.”
Shall we say this, when there shall be nothing from which to be
delivered? Therefore these four are necessary, because of our daily
life, but the three first in reference to the life eternal. But all
things let us ask, with a view of attaining to that life, and let us
pray here, that we be not separated from it. Every day must this prayer
be said by you, when you are baptized. For the Lord’s Prayer is said
daily in the Church before the Altar of God, and the faithful hear it.
We have no fear therefore as to your not learning it carefully, because
even if any of you should be unable to get it perfectly, he will learn
it by hearing it day by day.

<span id="vii.x-p64"></span>13. Therefore on the Saturday <span
id="fr_2079"></span>[2080](#fn_2079.md) when by the grace of God you will
keep the Vigil, you will have to repeat not the Prayer, but the Creed.
For if you do not know the Creed now, you will not hear that every day
in the Church, and among the people. But when you have learnt it, that
you may not forget it, say it every day when you rise; when you are
preparing for sleep, rehearse your Creed, to the Lord rehearse it,
remind yourselves of it, and be not weary of repeating it. For
repetition is useful, lest forgetfulness steal over you. Do not say, “I
said it yesterday, I have said it today, I say it every day, I know it
perfectly well.” Call thy faith to mind, look into thyself, let thy
Creed be as it were a mirror to thee. Therein see thyself, whether thou
dost believe all which thou professest to believe, and so rejoice day by
day in thy faith. Let it be thy wealth, let it be in a sort the daily
clothing of thy soul. Dost thou not always dress thyself when thou
risest? So by the daily repetition of thy Creed dress thy soul, lest
haply forgetfulness make it bare, and thou remain naked, and that take
place which the Apostle saith, (may it be far from thee!) “If so be that
being unclothed, <span id="fr_2080"></span>[2081](#fn_2080.md) we shall not
be found naked.” <span id="fr_2081"></span>[2082](#fn_2081.md) For we shall
be clothed by our faith: and this faith is at once a garment and a
breastplate; a garment against shame, a breastplate against adversity.
But when we shall have arrived at that place where we shall reign, no
need will there be to say the Creed. We shall see God; God Himself will
be our vision; the vision of God will be the reward of our present
faith.
