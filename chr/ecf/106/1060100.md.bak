<span id="vi.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—A Statement of the Reason Why
Matthew Enumerates One Succession of Ancestors for Christ, and Luke
Another.</span>

<span id="vi.v.iv-p2"></span>5. Furthermore, as to those critics who
find a difficulty in the circumstance that Matthew enumerates one series
of ancestors, beginning with David and travelling downwards to
Joseph, <span id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) while Luke specifies a
different succession, tracing it from Joseph upwards as far as to
David, <span id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) they might easily
perceive that Joseph may have had two fathers,—namely, one by whom he
was begotten, and a second by whom he may have been adopted. <span
id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md) For it was an ancient custom also
among that people to adopt children with the view of making sons for
themselves of those whom they had not begotten. For, leaving out of
sight the fact that Pharaoh’s daughter <span
id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md) adopted Moses (as she was a
foreigner), Jacob himself adopted his own grandsons, the sons of Joseph,
in these very intelligible terms: “Now, therefore, thy two sons which
were born unto thee before I came unto thee, are mine: Ephraim and
Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon: and <span id="page_104">p.
104</span> <span id="vi.v.iv-Page_104"></span>thy issue which thou
begettest after them shall be thine.” <span
id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md) Whence also it came to pass that there
were twelve tribes of Israel, although the tribe of Levi was omitted,
which did service in the temple; for along with that one the whole
number was thirteen, the sons of Jacob themselves being twelve. Thus,
too, we can understand how Luke, in the genealogy contained in his
Gospel, has named a father for Joseph, not in the person of the father
by whom he was begotten, but in that of the father by whom he was
adopted, tracing the list of the progenitors upwards until David is
reached. For, seeing that there is a necessity, as both evangelists give
a true narrative,—to wit, both Matthew and Luke,—that one of them should
hold by the line of the father who begat Joseph, and the other by the
line of the father who adopted him, whom should we suppose more likely
to have preserved the lineage of the adopting father, than that
evangelist who has declined to speak of Joseph as begotten by the person
whose son he has nevertheless reported him to be? For it is more
appropriate that one should have been called the son of the man by whom
he was adopted, than that he should be said to have been begotten by the
man of whose flesh he was not descended. Now when Matthew, accordingly,
used the phrases, “Abraham begat Isaac,” “Isaac begat Jacob,” and so on,
keeping steadily by the term “begat,” until he said at the close, “and
Jacob begat Joseph,” he gave us to know with sufficient clearness, that
he had traced out the order  <span id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) of
ancestors on to that father by whom Joseph was not adopted, but
begotten.

<span id="vi.v.iv-p9"></span>6. But even although Luke had said that
Joseph was begotten by Heli, that expression ought not to disturb us to
such an extent as to lead us to believe anything else than that by the
one evangelist the father begetting was mentioned, and by the other the
father adopting. For there is nothing absurd in saying that a person has
begotten, not after the flesh, it may be, but in love, one whom he has
adopted as a son. Those of us, to wit, to whom God has given power to
become His sons, He did not beget of His own nature and substance, as
was the case with His only Son; but He did indeed adopt us in His love.
And this phrase the apostle is seen repeatedly to employ just in order
to distinguish from us the only-begotten Son who is before every
creature, by whom all things were made, who alone is begotten of the
substance of the Father; who, in accordance with the equality of
divinity, is absolutely what the Father is, and who is declared to have
been sent with the view of assuming to Himself the flesh proper to that
race to which we too belong according to our nature, in order that by
His participation in our mortality, through His love for us, He might
make us partakers of His own divinity in the way of adoption. For the
apostle speaks thus: “But when the fulness of time was come, God sent
forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that
were under the law, that we might receive <span
id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) the adoption of sons.” <span
id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) And yet we are also said to be born of
God,—that is to say, in so far as we, who already were men, have
received power to be made the sons of God,—to be made such, moreover, by
grace, and not by nature. For if we were sons by nature, we never could
have been aught else. But when John said, “To them gave He power to
become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name,” he
proceeded at once to add these words, “which were born not of blood, nor
of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.” <span
id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) Thus, of the same persons he said,
first, that having received power they became the sons of God, which is
what is meant by that adoption which Paul mentions; and secondly, that
they were born of God. And in order the more plainly to show by what
grace this is effected, he continued thus: “And the Word was made flesh,
and dwelt among us,” <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md) —as if he
meant to say, What wonder is it that those should have been made sons of
God, although they were flesh, on whose behalf the only Son was made
flesh, although He was the Word? Howbeit there is this vast difference
between the two cases, that when we are made the sons of God we are
changed for the better; but when the Son of God was made the son of man,
He was not indeed changed into the worse, but He did certainly assume to
Himself what was below Him. James also speaks to this effect: “Of His
own will begat He us by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of
first fruits <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) of His
creatures.” <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) And to preclude our
supposing, as it might appear from the use of this term “begat,” that we
are made what He is Himself, he here points out very plainly, that what
is conceded to us in virtue of this adoption, is a kind of
headship <span id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) among the creatures.

<span id="vi.v.iv-p17"></span>7. It would be no departure from the
truth, therefore, even had Luke said that Joseph was begotten by the
person by whom he was really adopted. Even in that way he did in fact
beget him, not indeed to be a man, but certainly to be a son; just as
God has begotten us to be His sons, whom He had previously made to the
effect of being men. But He begat only one to be not simply the Son,
which the Father is not, but also God, which the Father in like manner
is. At <span id="page_105">p. 105</span> <span
id="vi.v.iv-Page_105"></span>the same time, it is evident that if Luke
had employed that phraseology, it would be altogether a matter of
dubiety as to which of the two writers mentioned the father adopting,
and which the father begetting of his own flesh; just as, on the other
hand, although neither of them had used the word “begat,” and although
the former evangelist had called him the son of the one person, and the
latter the son of the other, it would nevertheless be doubtful which of
them named the father by whom he was begotten, and which the father by
whom he was adopted. As the case stands now, however,—the one evangelist
saying that “Jacob begat Joseph,” and the other speaking of “Joseph who
was the son of Heli,”—by the very distinction which they have made
between the expressions, they have elegantly indicated the different
objects which they have taken in hand. But surely it might easily
suggest itself, as I have said, to a man of piety decided enough to make
him consider it right to seek some worthier explanation than that of
simply crediting the evangelist with stating what is false; it might, I
repeat, readily suggest itself to such a person to examine what reasons
there might be for one man being (supposed) capable of having two
fathers. This, indeed, might have suggested itself even to those
detractors, were it not that they preferred contention to consideration.

<span id="vi.v.iv-p5"></span> In the *Retractations* (ii. 16), Augustin
alludes to this passage with the view of correcting his statement
regarding the adoption. He tells us that, in speaking of the two several
fathers whom Joseph may have had, he should not have said that there
“was one by whom Joseph was begotten, and another by whom he may have
been adopted,” but should rather have put it thus: “one by whom he was
begotten, and another *unto* whom he was adopted” (*alteri* instead of
*ab altero adoptatus*). And the reason indicated for the correction is
the probability that the father who begat Joseph was the mother’s second
husband, who, according to the Levirate law, had married her on the
death of his brother without issue. \[That Luke gives the lineage of
Mary, who was the daughter of Heli, has been held by many scholars.
Weiss, in his edition of Meyer’s Commentary, claims that this is the
only grammatical view: see Robinson’s Greek Harmony, rev. ed. pp. 207,
208. Augustin passes over this solution apparently because he was more
concerned to press the priestly lineage of Mary.—R.\]
