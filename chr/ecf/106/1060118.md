<span id="vi.v.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Of the Order in Which the
Narrative Concerning Peter’s Mother-In-Law is Introduced.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxii-p2"></span>51. Matthew proceeds in the following
terms: “And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, He saw his wife’s
mother laid, and sick of a fever. And He touched her hand, and the fever
left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.” <span
id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876.md) Matthew has not indicated the date of
this incident; that is to say, he has specified neither before what
event nor after what occurrence it took place. For we are certainly
under no necessity of supposing that, because it is recorded after a
certain event, it must also have happened in actual matter of fact after
that event. And unquestionably, in this case, we are to understand that
he has introduced for record here something which he had omitted to
notice previously. For Mark brings in this narrative before his account
of that cleansing of the leper which he would appear to have placed
after the delivery of the sermon on the mount; <span
id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877.md) which discourse, however, he has left
unrelated. And thus, too, Luke <span id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878.md)
inserts this story of Peter’s mother-in-law after an occurrence <span
id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879.md) which it follows likewise in Mark’s
version, but also before that lengthened discourse, which has been
reproduced by him, and which may appear to be one with the sermon which
Matthew states to have been delivered on the mount. For of what
consequence is it in what place any of them may give his account; or
what difference does it make whether he inserts the matter in its proper
order, or brings in at a particular point what was previously omitted,
or mentions at an earlier stage what really happened at a later,
provided only that he contradicts neither himself nor a second writer in
the narrative of the same facts or of others? For as it is not in one’s
own power, however admirable and trustworthy may be the knowledge he has
once obtained of the facts, to determine the order in which he will
recall them to memory (for the way in which one thing comes into a
person’s mind before or after another is something which proceeds not as
we will, but simply as it is given to us), it is reasonable enough to
suppose that each of the evangelists believed it to have been his duty
to relate what he had to relate in that order in which it had pleased
God to suggest to his recollection the matters he was engaged in
recording. At least this might hold good in the case of those incidents
with regard to which the question of order, whether it were this or
that, detracted nothing from evangelical authority and truth.

<span id="vi.v.xxii-p7"></span>52. But as to the reason why the Holy
Spirit, who divideth to every man severally as He will, <span
id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880.md) and who therefore undoubtedly, with a
view to the establishing of their books on so distinguished an eminence
of authority, also governs and rules the minds of the holy men
themselves in the matter of suggesting the things they were to commit to
writing, has left one historian at liberty to construct his narrative in
one way, and another in a different fashion, that is a question which
any one may look into with pious consideration, and for which, by divine
help, the answer also may possibly be found. That, however, is not the
object of the work which we have taken in hand at present. The task we
have <span id="page_128">p. 128</span> <span
id="vi.v.xxii-Page_128"></span>proposed to ourselves is simply to
demonstrate that not one of the evangelists contradicts either himself
or his fellow-historians, whatever be the precise order in which he may
have had the ability or may have preferred to compose his account of
matters belonging to the doings and sayings of Christ; and that, too, at
once in the case of subjects identical with those recorded by others,
and in the case of subjects different from these. For this reason,
therefore, when the order of times is not apparent, we ought not to feel
it a matter of any consequence what order any of them may have adopted
in relating the events. But wherever the order is apparent, if the
evangelist then presents anything which seems to be inconsistent with
his own statements, or with those of another, we must certainly take the
passage into consideration, and endeavour to clear up the difficulty.
