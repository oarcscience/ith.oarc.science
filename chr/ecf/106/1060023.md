<span id="v.ii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.</span>

<span id="v.ii.xvii-p2"></span>51. “Again,” says He, “ye have heard that
it hath been said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself,
but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oath: <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) But I say unto you, Swear not at all;
neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne; nor by the earth, for it is
His footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great
King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make
one hair white or black. But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay,
nay: for whatsoever is more <span id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) than
these cometh of evil.” The righteousness of the Pharisees is not to
forswear oneself; and this is confirmed by Him who gives the command not
to swear, so far as relates to the righteousness of the kingdom of
heaven. For just as he who does not speak at all cannot speak falsely,
so he who does not swear at all cannot swear falsely. But yet, since he
who takes God to witness swears, this section must be carefully
considered, lest the apostle should seem to have acted contrary to the
Lord’s precept, who often swore in this way, when he says, “Now the
things which I write unto you, behold, before God I lie not;” <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) and again, “The God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie
not.” <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) Of like nature also is
that asseveration, “For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit
in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you
always in my prayers.” <span id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) Unless,
perchance, one were to say that it is to be reckoned swearing only when
something is spoken of by which one swears; so that he has not used an
oath, because he has not said, by God; but has said, “God is witness.”
It is ridiculous to think so; yet because of the contentious, or those
very slow of apprehension, lest any one should think there is a
difference, let him know that the apostle has used an oath in this way
also, saying, “By your rejoicing, I die daily.”  <span
id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) And let no one think that this is so
expressed as if it were said, Your rejoicing makes me die daily; just as
it is said, By his teaching he became learned, *i.e.* by his teaching it
came about that he was perfectly instructed: the Greek copies decide the
matter, where we find it written, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.xvii-p8.2"></span>Νὴ τὴν καύχησιν ὑμετέραν</span>, an
expression which is used only by one taking an oath. Thus, then, it is
understood that the Lord gave the command not to swear in this sense,
lest any one should eagerly seek after an oath as a good thing, and by
the constant use of oaths sink down through force of habit into perjury.
And therefore let him who understands that swearing is to be reckoned
not among things that are good, but among things that are necessary,
refrain as far as he can from indulging in it, unless by necessity, when
he sees men slow to believe what it is useful for them to believe,
except they be assured by an oath. To this, accordingly, reference is
made when it is said, “Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay;” this is
good, and what is to be desired. “For whatsoever is more than these
cometh of evil;” *i.e.*, if you are compelled to swear, know that it
comes of a necessity arising from the infirmity of those whom you are
trying to persuade of something; which infirmity is certainly an evil,
from which we daily pray to be delivered, when we say, “Deliver us from
evil.”  <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) Hence He has not said,
Whatsoever is more than these is evil; for you are not doing what is
evil when you make a good use of an oath, which, although not in itself
good, is yet necessary in order to persuade another that you are trying
to move him for some useful end; but it “cometh of evil” on his part by
whose infirmity you are compelled to swear. <span
id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) But no one learns, unless <span
id="page_23">p. 23</span> <span id="v.ii.xvii-Page_23"></span>he has had
experience, how difficult it is both to get rid of a habit of swearing,
and never to do rashly what necessity sometimes compels him to do. <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md)

<span id="v.ii.xvii-p12"></span>52. But it may be asked why, when it was
said, “But I say unto you, Swear not at all,” it was added, “neither by
heaven, for it is God’s throne,” etc., up to “neither by thy head.” I
suppose it was for this reason, that the Jews did not think they were
bound by the oath, if they had sworn by such things: and since they had
heard it said, “Thou shalt perform unto the Lord thine oath,” they did
not think an oath brought them under obligation to the Lord, if they
swore by heaven, or earth, or by Jerusalem, or by their head; and this
happened not from the fault of Him who gave the command, but because
they did not rightly understand it. Hence the Lord teaches that there is
nothing so worthless among the creatures of God, as that any one should
think that he may swear falsely by it; since created things, from the
highest down to the lowest, beginning with the throne of God and going
down to a white or black hair, are ruled by divine providence. “Neither
by heaven,” says He, “for it is God’s throne; nor by the earth, for it
is His footstool:” *i.e.*, when you swear by heaven or the earth, do not
imagine that your oath does not bring you under obligation to the Lord;
for you are convicted of swearing by Him who has heaven for His throne,
and the earth for His footstool. “Neither by Jerusalem, for it is the
city of the great King;” a better expression than if He had said, “My
\[city\];” although, however, we understand Him to have meant this. And,
because He is undoubtedly the Lord, the man who swears by Jerusalem is
bound by his oath to the Lord. “Neither shall thou swear by thy head.”
Now, what could any one suppose to belong more to himself than his own
head? But how is it ours, when we have not the power of making one hair
white or black? Hence, whoever should wish to swear even by his own
head, is bound by his oath to God, who in an ineffable way keeps all
things in His power, and is everywhere present. And here also all other
things are understood, which could not of course be enumerated; just as
that saying of the apostle we have mentioned, “By your rejoicing, I die
daily.” And to show that he was bound by this oath to the Lord, he has
added, “which I have in Christ Jesus.”

<span id="v.ii.xvii-p13"></span>53. But yet (I make the remark for the
sake of the carnal) we must not think that heaven is called God’s
throne, and the earth His footstool, because God has members placed in
heaven and in earth, in some such way as we have when we sit down; but
that seat means judgment. And since, in this organic whole of the
universe, heaven has the greatest appearance, and earth the least,—as if
the divine power were more present where the beauty excels, but still
were regulating the least degree of it in the most distant and in the
lowest regions,—He is said to sit in heaven, and to tread upon the
earth. But spiritually the expression heaven means holy souls, and earth
sinful ones: and since the spiritual man judges all things, yet he
himself is judged of no man, <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) he
is suitably spoken of as the seat of God; but the sinner to whom it is
said, “Earth thou art, and unto earth shall thou return,” <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) because, in accordance with that
justice which assigns what is suitable to men’s deserts, he is placed
among things that are lowest, and he who would not remain in the law is
punished under the law, is suitably taken as His footstool.

id="v.ii.xvii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.xvii-p11"></span> Augustin is somewhat perplexed about
the meaning, but decides the injunction to be directed against the abuse
of the oath, not to forbid it wholly. The oath was permitted by the law
([Lev. xxii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.ii.xvii-p11.1"></span>), was to be held sacred ([Num. xxx.
2](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#002)<span id="v.ii.xvii-p11.2"></span>.md),
and to be made in God’s name ([Deut. vi.
13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013)<span id="v.ii.xvii-p11.3"></span>.md).
It was customary under the Old Testament to swear ([Gen.
24:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#037.md), [Josh.
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.ii.xvii-p11.4"></span>; perhaps only a solemn affirmation), and in
the name of the Lord ([1 Sam. xx.
42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#042.md)<span id="v.ii.xvii-p11.5"></span>;
Irenæus, Clement, Origen, Chrysostom, etc.). The Anabaptists,
Mennonites, and Quakers understand the precept to forbid all oaths, even
in the civil court. “Christendom, if it were fully conformed to Christ’s
will, as it should be, would tolerate no oaths whatever” (Meyer). “The
proper state of Christians is to require no oaths” (Alford). If
interpreted as a definite prohibition of all swearing, the passage comes
into conflict with Christ’s own example ([Matt. xxvi.
63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063)<span id="v.ii.xvii-p11.6"></span>.md),
and the apostle’s conduct in the passages quoted by Augustin. The
meaning has been restricted to rash and frivolous oaths on the street
and in the market (Keim); in daily conversation (Carr, *Camb. Bible for
Schools*). In the ideal Christian community, where truth and honesty
prevail, oaths will be superfluous: the simple asseverations, “Yea,
nay,” will be sufficient. To this, Christ’s precept ultimately looks.
But He, no doubt, had in mind the widespread profanity of His day, and
the current opinion that only oaths containing the name of God were
binding (Lightfoot cites from the Rabbinical books to this effect). All
unnecessary appeals to God, as well as careless and profane swearing,
are forbidden, as coming either from bad passions within or a want of
reverence. “Prohibition would be repeal of the Mosaic law” (Plumptre).
“All strengthening of the simple ‘Yea and nay’ is occasioned by the
presence of sin and Satan in the world. There is no more striking proof
of the existence of evil than the prevalence of the foolish, low,
useless habit of swearing. It could never have arisen if men did not
believe each other to be liars,” etc. (Schaff). “Men use their
protestations because they are distrustful one of another. An oath is
physic, which supposes disease” (M. Henry). When the oath is performed
for the “sake of ethical interests, as when the civil authority demands
it,” as seems to be necessary and safe for society in its present
unsanctified condition, the precept does not interfere (Köstlin, art.
“Oath,” *Schaff-Herzog Encycl.*, Meyer, Wuttke, Alford, Tholuck, etc.).
An interesting imitation of the Rabbinical casuistry above referred to
was practised by the crafty and subtle Louis XI. Scott says (Introd. to
*Quentin Durward*), “He admitted to one or two peculiar forms of oath
the force of a binding obligation which he denied to all others,
strictly preserving the secret; which mode of swearing he really
accounted obligatory, as one of the most valuable of State secrets.”
