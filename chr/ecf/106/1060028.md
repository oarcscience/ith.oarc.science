<span id="v.ii.xxii"></span>

<span id="v.ii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.</span>

<span id="v.ii.xxii-p2"></span>73. But the question before us is
rendered more urgent by what the Apostle John says: “If any man see his
brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and the Lord
shall give him life for him who sinneth not unto death. There is a sin
unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.” <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) For he manifestly shows that there are
certain brethren for whom we are not commanded to pray, although the
Lord bids us pray even for our persecutors. Nor can the question in hand
be solved, unless we acknowledge that there are certain sins in brethren
which are more heinous than the persecution of enemies. Moreover, that
brethren mean Christians can be proved by many examples from the divine
Scriptures. Yet that one is plainest which the apostle thus states: “For
the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving
wife is sanctified in the brother.” <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) For he has not added the word *our*;
but has thought it plain, as he wished a Christian who had an
unbelieving wife to be understood by the expression *brother*. And
therefore he says a little after, “But if the unbelieving depart, let
him depart: a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such
cases.” <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) Hence I am of opinion
that the sin of a brother is unto death, when any one, after coming to
the knowledge of God through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, makes
an assault on the brotherhood, and is impelled by the fires of envy to
oppose that grace itself by which he is reconciled to God. But the sin
is not unto death, if any one has not withdrawn his love from a brother,
but through some infirmity of disposition has failed to perform the
incumbent duties of brotherhood. And on this account our Lord also on
the cross says, “Father, forgive <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md)
them; for they know not what they do:” <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) <span id="page_31">p. 31</span> <span
id="v.ii.xxii-Page_31"></span>for, not yet having become partakers of
the grace of the Holy Spirit, they had not yet entered the fellowship of
the holy brotherhood. And the blessed Stephen in the Acts of the
Apostles prays for those by whom he is being stoned, <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) because they had not yet believed on
Christ, and were not fighting against that common grace. And the Apostle
Paul on this account, I believe, does not pray for Alexander, because he
was already a brother, and had sinned unto death, viz. by making an
assault on the brotherhood through envy. But for those who had not
broken off their love, but had given way through fear, he prays that
they may be pardoned. For thus he expresses it: “Alexander the
coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his
works. Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our
words.” <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) Then he adds for whom he
prays, thus expressing it: “At my first defence no man stood with me,
but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their
charge.” <span id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md)

<span id="v.ii.xxii-p11"></span>74. It is this difference in their sins
which separates Judas the betrayer from Peter the denier: not that a
penitent is not to be pardoned, for we must not come into collision with
that declaration of our Lord, where He enjoins that a brother is to be
pardoned, when he asks his brother to pardon him; <span
id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) but that the ruin connected with that
sin is so great, that he cannot endure the humiliation of asking for it,
even if he should be compelled by a bad conscience both to acknowledge
and divulge his sin. For when Judas had said, “I have sinned, in that I
have betrayed the innocent blood,” yet it was easier for him in despair
to run and hang himself, <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) than in
humility to ask for pardon. And therefore it is of much consequence to
know what sort of repentance God pardons. For many much more readily
confess that they have sinned, and are so angry with themselves that
they vehemently wish they had not sinned; but yet they do not condescend
to humble the heart and to make it contrite, and to implore pardon: and
this disposition of mind we must suppose them to have, as feeling
themselves already condemned because of the greatness of their sin.

<span id="v.ii.xxii-p14"></span>75. And this is perhaps the sin against
the Holy Ghost, *i.e.* through malice and envy to act in opposition to
brotherly love after receiving the grace of the Holy Ghost,—a sin which
our Lord says is not forgiven either in this world or in the world to
come. And hence it may be asked whether the Jews sinned against the Holy
Ghost, when they said that our Lord was casting out devils by Beelzebub,
the prince of the devils: whether we are to understand this as said
against our Lord Himself, because He says of Himself in another passage,
“If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more
shall they call them of His household!” <span
id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) or whether, inasmuch as they had
spoken from great envy, being ungrateful for so manifest benefits,
although they were not yet Christians, they are, from the very greatness
of their envy, to be supposed to have sinned against the Holy Ghost?
This latter is certainly not to be gathered from our Lord’s words. For
although He has said in the same passage, “And whosoever speaketh a word
against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh
a word against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in
this world, neither in the world to come;” yet it may seem that He
admonished them for this purpose, that they should come to His grace,
and after accepting of it should not so sin as they have now sinned. For
now they have spoken a word against the Son of man, and it may be
forgiven them, if they be converted, and believe on Him, and receive the
Holy Ghost; but if, after receiving Him, they should choose to envy the
brotherhood, and to assail the grace they have received, it cannot be
forgiven them, neither in this world nor in the world to come. For if He
reckoned them so condemned, that there was no hope left for them, He
would not judge that they ought still to be admonished, as He did by
adding the statement, “Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or
else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt.” <span
id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md)

<span id="v.ii.xxii-p17"></span>76. Let it be understood, therefore,
that we are to love our enemies, and to do good to those who hate us,
and to pray for those who persecute us, in such a way, that it is at the
same time understood that there are certain sins of brethren for which
we are not commanded to pray; lest, through unskilfulness on our part,
divine Scripture should seem to contradict itself (a thing which cannot
happen). But whether, as we are not to pray for certain parties, so we
are also to pray against some, has not yet become sufficiently evident.
For it is said in general, “Bless, and curse not;” and again,
“Recompense to no man evil for evil.” <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) Moreover, while you do not pray for
one, you do not therefore pray against him: for you may see that his
punishment is certain, and his salvation altogether hopeless; and you do
not pray for him, not because you hate him, but because you feel you can
profit him nothing, and you do not wish your prayer to be rejected by
the most righteous Judge. But what are we to think respecting those
parties against whom we have it revealed <span id="page_32">p. 32</span>
<span id="v.ii.xxii-Page_32"></span>that prayers were offered by the
saints, not that they might be turned from their error (for in this way
prayer is offered rather for them), but that final condemnation might
come upon them: not as it was offered against the betrayer of our Lord
by the prophet; for that, as has been said, was a prediction of things
to come, not a wish for punishment: nor as it was offered by the apostle
against Alexander; for respecting that also enough has been already
said: but as we read in the Apocalypse of John of the martyrs praying
that they may be avenged; <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) while
the well-known first martyr prayed that those who stoned him should be
pardoned.

<span id="v.ii.xxii-p20"></span>77. But we need not be moved by this
circumstance. For who would venture to affirm, in regard to those
white-robed saints, when they pleaded that they should be avenged,
whether they pleaded against the men themselves or against the dominion
of sin? For of itself it is a genuine avenging of the martyrs, and one
full of righteousness and mercy, that the dominion of sin should be
overthrown, under which dominion they were subjected to so great
sufferings. And for its overthrow the apostle strives, saying, “Let not
sin therefore reign in your mortal body.” <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) But the dominion of sin is destroyed
and overthrown, partly by the amendment of men, so that the flesh is
brought under subjection to the spirit; partly by the condemnation of
those who persevere in sin, so that they are righteously disposed of in
such a way that they cannot be troublesome to the righteous who reign
with Christ. Look at the Apostle Paul; does it not seem to you that he
avenges the martyr Stephen in his own person, when he says: “So fight I,
not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it
into subjection”? <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) For he was
certainly laying prostrate, and weakening, and bringing into subjection,
and regulating that principle in himself whence he had persecuted
Stephen and the other Christians. Who then can demonstrate that the holy
martyrs were not asking from the Lord such an avenging of themselves,
when at the same time, in order to their being avenged, they might
lawfully wish for the end of this world, in which they had endured such
martyrdoms? And they who pray for this, on the one hand pray for their
enemies who are curable, and on the other hand do not pray against those
who have chosen to be incurable: because God also, in punishing them, is
not a malevolent Torturer, but a most righteous Disposer. Without any
hesitation, therefore, let us love our enemies, let us do good to those
that hate us, and let us pray for those who persecute us.
