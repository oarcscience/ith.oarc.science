Who Rejected the God of Israel Alone.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii-p2"></span>25. However, here is a matter which
should meet with more careful consideration at their hands,—namely, what
they take the God of Israel to be, and why they have not admitted Him to
the honours of worship among them, in the way that they have done with
the gods of other nations that have been made subject to the imperial
power of Rome? This question demands an answer all the more, when we see
that they are of the mind that all the gods ought to be worshipped by
the man of wisdom. Why, then, has He been excluded from the number of
these others? If He is very mighty, why is He the only deity that is not
worshipped by them? If He has little or no might, why are the images of
other gods broken in pieces by all the nations, while He is now almost
the only God that is worshipped among these peoples? From the grasp of
this question these men shall never be able to extricate themselves, who
worship both the greater and the lesser deities, whom they hold to be
gods, and at the same time refuse to worship this God, who has proved
Himself stronger than all those to whom they do service. If He is \[a
God\] of great virtue, <span id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567.md) why has
He been deemed worthy only of rejection? And if He is \[a God\] of
little or no power, why has He been able to accomplish so much, although
rejected? If He is good, why is He the only one separated from the other
good deities? And if He is evil, why is He, who stands thus alone, not
subjugated by so many good deities? If He is truthful, why are His
precepts scorned? And if He is a liar, why are His predictions
fulfilled?
