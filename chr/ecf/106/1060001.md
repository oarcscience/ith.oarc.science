id="ii-p15.1"></span>Introductory Notice by Dr. Salmond.</span>

<span id="ii-p16"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="ii-p16.1"></span>Book I.      The treatise opens with a short
statement on the subject of the authority of the Evangelists, their
number, their order, and the different plans of their narratives.
Augustin then prepares for the discussion of the questions relating to
their harmony, by joining issue in this book with those who raise a
difficulty in the circumstance that Christ has left no writing of His
own, or who falsely allege that certain books were composed by Him on
the arts of magic. He also meets the objections of those who, in
opposition to the evangelical teaching, assert that the disciples of
Christ at once ascribe more to their Master than He really was, when
they affirmed that He was God, and inculcated what they had not been
instructed in by Him, when they interdicted the worship of the gods.
Against these antagonists he vindicates the teaching of the Apostles, by
appealing to the utterances of the Prophets, and by showing that the God
of Israel was to be the sole object of worship, who also, although He
was the only Deity to whom acceptance was denied in former times by the
Romans, and that for the very reason that He prohibited them from
worshipping other gods along with Himself, has now in the end made the
Empire of Rome subject to His Name, and among all nations has broken
their idols in pieces through the preaching of the Gospel, as He had
promised by His prophets that the event should be.</span>

<span id="ii-p17"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="ii-p17.1"></span>Book II.     In this book Augustin undertakes an
orderly examination of the Gospel according to Matthew, on to the
narrative of the Supper, and institutes a comparison between it and the
other Gospels by Mark, Luke, and John, with the view of demonstrating a
complete harmony between the four Evangelists throughout all these
sections.</span>

<span id="ii-p18"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="ii-p18.1"></span>Book III.                This book contains a
demonstration of the harmony of the Evangelists from the accounts of the
Supper on to the end of the Gospel, the narratives given by the several
writers being collated, and the whole arranged in one orderly
connection.</span>

<span id="ii-p19"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="ii-p19.1"></span>Book IV.                This book embraces a
discussion of those passages which are peculiar to Mark, Luke, or
John.</span>
