<span id="vi.v.lxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIV.—Of the Occasions on Which He
Foretold His Passion in Private to His Disciples; And of the Time When
the Mother of Zebedee’s Children Came with Her Sons, Requesting that One
of Them Should Sit on His Right Hand, and the Other on His Left Hand;
And of the Absence of Any Discrepancy Between Matthew and the Other Two
Evangelists on These Subjects.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxv-p2"></span>124. Matthew continues his narrative in
the following terms: “And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve
disciples apart, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and
the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the
scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him to
the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify Him; and the third
day He shall rise again. Then came to Him the mother of Zebedee’s
children with her sons, worshipping Him, and desiring a certain thing of
Him;” and so on, down to the words, “Even as the Son of man came not to
be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for
many.” <span id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121.md) Here again Mark keeps
the same order as Matthew, only he represents the sons of Zebedee to
have made the request themselves; while Matthew has stated that it was
preferred on their behalf not by their own personal application, but by
their mother, as she had laid what was their wish before the Lord. Hence
Mark has briefly intimated what was said on that occasion as spoken by
them, rather than by her \[in their name\]. And to conclude with the
matter, it is to them rather than to her, according to Matthew no less
than according to Mark, that the Lord returned His reply. Luke, on the
other hand, after narrating in the same order our Lord’s predictions to
the twelve disciples on the subject of His passion and resurrection,
leaves unnoticed what the other two evangelists immediately go on to
record; and after the interposition of these passages, he is joined by
his fellow-writers again \[at the point where they report the incident\]
at Jericho.  <span id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122.md) Moreover, as to
what Matthew and Mark have stated with respect to the princes of the
Gentiles exercising dominion over those who are subject to them,—namely,
that it should not be so with them \[the disciples\], but that he who
was greatest among them should even be a servant to the others,—Luke
also gives us something of the same tenor, although not in that
connection; <span id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123.md) and the order
itself indicates that the same sentiment was expressed by the Lord on a
second occasion.
