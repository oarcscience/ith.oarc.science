<span id="vi.vi.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Of the Consistency of Matthew’s
Version with that of Mark in the Account of the Potion Offered Him to
Drink, Which is Introduced Before the Narrative of His
Crucifixion.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xii-p2"></span>38. Matthew then proceeds in these terms:
“And they came unto a place called Golgotha; that is to say, a place of
a skull.” <span id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376.md) So far as the place
is concerned, they are most unmistakeably at one. The same Matthew next
adds, “and they gave Him wine <span id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377.md)
to drink, mingled with gall; and when He had tasted thereof, He would
not drink.” <span id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md) This is given by
Mark as follows: “And they gave Him to drink wine mingled with myrrh;
and He received it not.” <span id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379.md) Here
we may understand Matthew to have conveyed the same sense as Mark, when
he speaks of the wine being “mingled with gall.” For the gall is
mentioned with a view to express the bitterness of the potion. And wine
mingled with myrrh is remarkable for its bitterness. The fact may also
be that gall and myrrh together made the wine exceedingly bitter. Again,
when Mark says that “He received it not,” we understand the phrase to
denote that He did not receive it so as actually to drink it. He did
taste <span id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span
id="vi.vi.xii-Page_197"></span>it, however, as Matthew certifies. Thus
Mark’s words, “He received it not,” convey the same meaning as Matthew’s
version, “He would not drink.” The former, however, has said nothing
about His tasting the potion.
