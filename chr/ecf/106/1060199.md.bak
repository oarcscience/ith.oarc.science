<span id="vi.vi.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Of the Question as to the
Consistency of the Several Notices Given by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, on
the Subject of the Astonishment Felt by the Centurion and Those Who Were
with Him.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xxi-p2"></span>57. Matthew proceeds thus: “And the earth
did quake, and the rocks rent; and the graves were opened; and many
bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after
the resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto
many.” <span id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) There is no reason to
fear that these facts, which have been related only by Matthew, may
appear to be inconsistent with the narratives presented by any one of
the rest. The same evangelist then continues as follows: “Now when the
centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, saw the
earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly,
saying, Truly this was the Son of God.” <span
id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454.md) Mark offers this version: “And when
the centurion which stood over against Him saw that He so cried out, and
gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this was the Son of God.” <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md) Luke’s report runs thus: “Now when
the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly
this was a righteous man.” <span id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456.md)
Here Matthew says that it was when they saw the earthquake that the
centurion and those who were with him were thus astonished, whereas Luke
represents the man’s amazement to have been drawn forth by the fact that
Jesus uttered such a cry, and then gave up the ghost; thus making it
clear how He had it in His own power to determine the time for His
dying. But this involves no discrepancy. For as the said Matthew not
only tells us how the centurion “saw the earthquake,” but also appends
the words, “and those things that were done,” he has indicated that
there was room enough for Luke to represent the Lord’s death as itself
the thing which called forth the centurion’s wonder. For that event is
also one of the things which were done in so marvellous a manner then.
At the same time, even although Matthew had not added any such
statement, it would still have been perfectly legitimate to suppose,
that as many astonishing things did take place at that time, and as the
centurion and those who were with him may well have looked upon them all
with amazement, the historians were at liberty to select for narration
any particular incident which they were severally disposed to instance
as the subject of the man’s wonder. And it would not be fair to impeach
them with inconsistency, simply because one of them may have specified
one occurrence as the immediate cause of the centurion’s amazement,
while another introduces a different incident. For all these events
together had really been matters for the man’s astonishment. Again, the
mere fact that one evangelist tells us that the centurion said, “Truly
this was the Son of God,” while another informs us that the words were,
“Truly this man was the Son of God,” will create no difficulty to <span
id="page_206">p. 206</span> <span id="vi.vi.xxi-Page_206"></span>any one
who has retained some recollection of the numerous statements and
discussions bearing upon similar cases, which have already been given
above. For these different versions of the words both convey precisely
the same sense and although one writer introduces the word “man” while
another does not, that implies no kind of contradiction. A greater
appearance of discrepancy may be supposed to be created by the
circumstance, that the words which Luke reports the centurion to have
uttered are not “This was the Son of God,” but “This was a righteous
man.” But we ought to suppose either that both things were actually said
by the centurion, and that two of the evangelists have recorded the one
expression, and the third the other; or else perhaps that it was Luke’s
intention to bring out the exact idea which the centurion had in view
when he said that Jesus was the Son of God. For it may be the case that
the centurion did not really understand Him to be the Only-begotten,
equal with the Father; but that he called Him the Son of God simply
because he believed Him to be a righteous man, as many righteous men
have been named sons of God. Moreover, when Luke says, “Now when the
centurion saw what was done,” he has really used terms which cover all
the marvellous things which occurred on that occasion, commemorating a
single deed of wonder, so to speak, of which all those miraculous
incidents were, as we may say, members and parts. But, once more, as
regards the circumstance that Matthew has also referred to those who
were with the centurion, while the others have left these parties
unnoticed, to whom will this not explain itself on the well-understood
principle that there is no contradiction necessarily involved in the
mere fact that one writer records what another passes by without
mention? And, finally, as to Matthew’s having told us that “they feared
greatly,” while Luke has said nothing about the man being afraid, but
has informed us that “he glorified God,” who can fail to understand that
he glorified \[God\] just by the fear which he exhibited?
