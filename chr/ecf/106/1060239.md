<span id="vii.xxii-p3"></span>*Again on the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xxii-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. xi.
28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md)<span id="vii.xxii-p3.2"></span>,
“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
you rest,” etc.*

<span id="vii.xxii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xxii-p4.1"></span>It</span> seems strange to some, Brethren,
when they hear the Lord say, “Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are
heavy laden, and I will refresh you. Take my yoke upon you and learn of
Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your
souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.” <span
id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322.md) And they consider that they who
have fearlessly bowed their necks to this yoke, and have with much
submission taken this burden upon their shoulders, are tossed about and
exercised by so great difficulties in the world, that they seem not to
be called from labour to rest, but from rest to labour rather; since the
Apostle also saith, “All who will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall
suffer persecution.” <span id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323.md) So one
will say, “How is the yoke easy, and the burden light,” when to bear
this yoke and burden is nothing else, but to live godly in Christ? And
how is it said, “Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
and I will refresh you”? and not rather said, “Come ye who are at ease
and idle, that ye may labour.” For so he found those men idle and at
ease, whom he hired into the vineyard, <span
id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324.md) that they might bear the heat of
the day. And we hear the Apostle under that easy yoke and light burden
say, “In all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much
patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in
stripes,” <span id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325.md) etc., and in
another place of the same Epistle, “Of the Jews five times received I
forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I
stoned, thrice have I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been
in the deep:” <span id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326.md) and the rest of
the perils, which may be enumerated indeed, but endured they cannot be
but by the help of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="vii.xxii-p10"></span>2. All these grievous and heavy trials
which he mentioned, did he very frequently and abundantly sustain; but
in very deed the Holy Spirit was with him in the wasting of the outward
man, to renew the inner man from day to day, and by the taste of
spiritual rest in the affluence of the delights of God to soften down by
the hope of future blessedness all present hardships, and to alleviate
all heavy trials. Lo, how sweet a yoke of Christ did he bear, and how
light a burden; so that he could say that all those hard and grievous
sufferings at the recital of which as just above every hearer shudders,
were a “light tribulation;” as he beheld with the inward eyes, the eyes
of faith, at how great a price of things temporal must be purchased the
life to come, the escape from the everlasting pains of the ungodly, the
full enjoyment, free from all anxiety, of the eternal happiness of the
righteous. Men suffer themselves to be cut and burnt, that the pains not
of eternity, but of some more lasting sore than usual, may be bought off
at the priceof severer pain. For a languid and uncertain period of a
very short repose, and that too at the end of life, the soldier is worn
down by all the hard trials of war, restless it may be for more years in
his labours, than he will have to enjoy his rest in ease. To what storms
and tempests, to what a fearful and tremendous raging of sky and sea, do
the busy merchantmen expose themselves, that they may acquire riches
inconstant as the wind, and full of perils and tempests, greater even
than those by which they were acquired! What heats, and colds, what
perils, from horses, from ditches, from precipices, from rivers, from
wild beasts, do huntsmen undergo, what pain of hunger and thirst, what
straitened allowances of the cheapest and meanest meat and drink, that
they may catch a beast! and sometimes after all, the flesh of the beast
for which they endure all this is of no use for the table. And although
a boar or a stag be caught, it is more sweet to the hunter’s mind
because it has been caught, than it is to the eater’s palate because it
is dressed. By what sharp corrections of almost daily stripes is the
tender age of boys brought under! By what great pains even of watching
and abstinence in the schools are they exercised, not to learn true
wisdom, but for the sake of riches, and the honours of an empty show,
that they may learn arithmetic, <span
id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327.md) and other literature, and the
deceits of eloquence!

<span id="vii.xxii-p12"></span>3. Now in all these instances, they who
do not love these things feel them as great severities; whereas they who
love them endure the same, it is true, but they do not seem to feel them
severe. For love makes all, the hardest and most distressing things,
altogether easy, and almost nothing. How much more surely then and
easily will charity do with a view to true blessedness, that which mere
desire does as it can, with a view to what is but misery? How easily is
any temporal adversity endured, if it be that eternal punishment may be
avoided, and eternal rest procured! Not without good reason did that
vessel of election say with exceeding joy, “The sufferings of this
present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be
revealed in us.” <span id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328.md) See then how
it is that that “yoke is easy, and that burden light.” And if it be
strait to the few who choose it, yet is it easy to all who love it. The
Psalmist saith, <span id="page_318">p. 318</span> <span
id="vii.xxii-Page_318"></span>“Because of the words of Thy lips I have
kept hard ways.” <span id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329.md) But the
things which are hard to those who labour, lose their roughness <span
id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330.md) to those same men when they love.
Wherefore it has been so arranged by the dispensation of the Divine
goodness, that to “the inner man who is renewed from day to day,” <span
id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331.md) placed no longer under the Law but
under Grace, and freed from the burdens of numberless observances which
were indeed a heavy yoke, but meetly imposed on a stubborn neck, every
grievous trouble which that prince who is cast forth could inflict from
without on the outward man, should through the easiness of a simple
faith, and a good hope, and a holy charity, become light through the joy
within. For to a good will nothing is so easy, as this good will to
itself, and this is enough for God. How much soever therefore this world
may rage, most truly did the angels exclaim when the Lord was born in
the flesh, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of
good will;” <span id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332.md) because “His
yoke,” who was then born, “is easy, and His burden light.” And as the
Apostle saith, “God is faithful, who will not suffer us to be tempted
above that we are able to bear; but will with the temptation also make a
way to escape, that we may be able to bear it.” <span
id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333.md)
