<span id="vi.v.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Of the Man Sick of the Palsy to
Whom the Lord Said, “Thy Sins are Forgiven Thee,” And “Take Up Thy Bed;”
And in Especial, of the Question Whether Matthew and Mark are Consistent
with Each Other in Their Notice of the Place Where This Incident Took
Place, in So Far as Matthew Says It Happened “In His Own City,” While
Mark Says It Was in Capharnaum.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxvi-p2"></span>57. Hereupon Matthew proceeds with his
recital, still preserving the order of time, and connects his narrative
in the following manner:—“And He entered into a ship, and passed over,
and came into His own city. And, behold, they brought to Him a man sick
of the palsy, lying on a bed;” and so on down to where it is said, “But
when the multitude saw it, they marvelled; and glorified God, which had
given such power unto men.” <span id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908.md) Mark
and Luke have also told the story of this paralytic. Now, as regards
Matthew’s stating that the Lord said, “Son, be of good cheer, thy sins
are forgiven thee;” while Luke makes the address run, not as “son,” but
as “man,”—this only helps to bring out the Lord’s meaning more
explicitly. For these sins were \[thus said to be\] forgiven to the
“man,” inasmuch as the very fact that he was a man would make it
impossible for him to say, “I have not sinned;” and at the same time,
that mode of address served to indicate that He who forgave sins to man
was Himself God. Mark, again, has given the same form of words as
Matthew, but he has left out the terms, “Be of good cheer.” It is also
possible, indeed, that the whole saying ran thus: “Man, be of good
cheer: son, thy sins are forgiven thee;” or thus: “Son, be of good
cheer: man, thy sins are forgiven thee;” or the words may have been
spoken in some other congruous order.

<span id="vi.v.xxvi-p4"></span>58. A difficulty, however, may certainly
arise when we observe how Matthew tells the story of the paralytic after
this fashion: “And He entered into a ship, and passed over, and came
into His own city. And, behold, they brought to Him a man sick of the
palsy, lying on a bed;” whereas Mark speaks of the incident as taking
place not in His own city, which indeed is called Nazareth, but in
Capharnaum. His narrative is to the following effect:—“And again He
entered into Capharnaum after some days; and it was noised that He was
in the house. And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that
there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door:
and He spake a word <span id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909.md) unto them.
And they came unto Him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne
of four. And when they could not come nigh unto Him for the press, they
uncovered the roof where He was: and when they had broken it up, they
let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. And when Jesus saw
their faith;” <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span
id="vi.v.xxvi-Page_131"></span>and so forth. <span
id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910.md) Luke, on the other hand, does not
mention the place in which the incident happened, but gives the tale
thus: “And it came to pass on a certain day that He was sitting
teaching, <span id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911.md) and there were
Pharisees and doctors of the law also sitting by, which were come out of
every town of Galilee, and Judæa, and Jerusalem: and the power of the
Lord was present to heal them. And, behold, men brought in a bed a man
which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and
to lay him before Him. And when they could not find by what way they
might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the
house-top, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the
midst before Jesus. And when He saw their faith, He said, Man, thy sins
are forgiven thee;” and so forth. <span
id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912.md) The question, therefore, remains one
between Mark and Matthew, in so far as Matthew writes of the incident as
taking place in the Lord’s city; <span id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913.md)
while Mark locates it in Capharnaum. This question would be more
difficult to solve if Matthew mentioned Nazareth by name. But, as the
case stands, when we reflect that the state of Galilee itself might have
been called Christ’s city, <span id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914.md)
because Nazareth was in Galilee, just as the whole region which was made
up of so many cities <span id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915.md) is yet
called a Roman state; <span id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916.md) when,
further, it is considered that so many nations are comprehended in that
city, of which it is written, “Glorious things are spoken of thee, O
city of God;” <span id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917.md) and also that
God’s ancient people, though dwelling in so many cities, have yet been
spoken of as one house, the house of Israel, <span
id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918.md) —who can doubt that \[it may be fairly
said that\] Jesus wrought this work in His own city \[or, *state*\],
inasmuch as He did it in the city of Capharnaum, which was a city of
that Galilee to which He had returned when He crossed over again from
the country of the Gerasenes, so that when He came into Galilee He might
correctly be said to have come into His own city \[or, *state*\], in
which ever town of Galilee He might happen to be? This explanation may
be vindicated more particularly on the ground that Capharnaum itself
held a position of such eminence in Galilee that it was reckoned to be a
kind of metropolis. But even were it altogether illegitimate to take the
city of Christ in the sense either of Galilee itself, in which Nazareth
was situated, or of Capharnaum, which was distinguished as in a certain
sense the capital of Galilee, we might still affirm that Matthew has
simply passed over all that happened after Jesus came into His own city
until He reached Capharnaum, and that he has simply tacked on the
narrative of the healing of the paralytic at this point; just as the
writers do in many instances, leaving unnoticed much that intervenes,
and, without any express indication of the omissions they are making,
proceeding precisely as if what they subjoin, followed actually in
literal succession. <span id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md)
