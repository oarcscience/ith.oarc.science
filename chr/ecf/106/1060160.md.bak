<span id="vi.v.lxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIII.—Of the Little Children on Whom
He Laid His Hands; Of the Rich Man to Whom He Said, “Sell All that Thou
Hast;” Of the Vineyard in Which the Labourers Were Hired at Different
Hours; And of the Question as to the Absence of Any Discrepancy Between
Matthew and the Other Two Evangelists on These Subjects.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxiv-p2"></span>123. Matthew proceeds thus: “Then were
there brought unto Him little children, that He should put His hands on
them, and pray; and the disciples rebuked them;” and so on, down to
where we read, “For many are called, but few are chosen.” <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md) Mark has followed the same order
here as Matthew. <span id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md) But Matthew
is the only one <span id="page_157">p. 157</span> <span
id="vi.v.lxiv-Page_157"></span>who introduces the section relating to
the labourers who were hired for the vineyard. Luke, on the other hand,
first mentions what He said to those who were asking each other who
should be the greatest, and next subjoins at once the passage concerning
the man whom they had seen casting out devils, although he did not
follow Him; then he parts company with the other two at the point where
he tells us how He stedfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem; <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md) and after the interposition of a
number of subjects, <span id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md) he joins
them again in giving the story of the rich man, to whom the word is
addressed, “Sell all that thou hast,” <span
id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md) which individual’s case is related
here by the other two evangelists, but still in the succession which is
followed by all the narratives alike. For in the passage referred to in
Luke, that writer does not fail to bring in the story of the little
children, just as the other two do immediately before the mention of the
rich man. With regard, then, to the accounts which are given us of this
rich person, who asks what good thing he should do in order to obtain
eternal life, there may appear to be some discrepancy between them,
because the words were, according to Matthew, “Why askest thou me about
the good?” while according to the others they were, “Why callest thou me
good?” The sentence, “Why askest thou me about the good?” may then be
referred more particularly to what was expressed by the man when he put
the question, “What good thing shall I do?” For there we have both the
name “good” applied to Christ, and the question put.  <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120.md) But the address “Good Master” does
not of itself convey the question. Accordingly, the best method of
disposing of it is to understand both these sentences to have been
uttered, “Why callest thou me good?” and, “Why askest thou me about the
good?”
