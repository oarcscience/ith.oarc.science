<span id="vi.v.xxxix-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.—Of the Occasion on Which It
Was Said to Him that He Cast Out Devils in the Power of Beelzebub, and
of the Declarations Drawn Forth from Him by that Circumstance in Regard
to the Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit, and with Respect to the Two
Trees; And of the Question Whether There is Not Some Discrepancy in
These Sections Between Matthew and the Other Two Evangelists, and
Particularly Between Matthew and Luke.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxxix-p2"></span>85. Matthew proceeds with his narrative
in the following terms: “And all the people were amazed, and said, Is
not this the son of David? But when the Pharisees heard it, they said,
This fellow doth not cast out devils but in Beelzebub, the prince of the
devils. And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom
divided against itself shall be brought to desolation;” and so on, down
to the words, “By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words
thou shalt be condemned.” <span id="fr_1012"></span>[1013](#fn_1012.md)
Mark does not bring in this allegation against Jesus, that He cast out
devils in \[the power of\] Beelzebub, in immediate sequence on the story
of the dumb man; but after certain other matters, recorded by himself
alone, he introduces this incident also, either because he recalled it
to mind in a different connection, and so appended it there, or because
he had at first made certain omissions in his history, and after
noticing these, took up this order of narration again.  <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[1014](#fn_1013.md) On the other hand, Luke gives an
account of these things almost in the same language as Matthew has
employed. <span id="fr_1014"></span>[1015](#fn_1014.md) And the
circumstance that Luke here designates the Spirit of God as the finger
of God, does not betray any departure from a genuine identity in sense;
but it rather teaches us an additional lesson, giving us to know in what
manner we are to interpret the phrase “the finger of God” wherever it
occurs in the Scriptures. Moreover, with regard to other matters which
are left unmentioned in this section both by Mark and by Luke, no
difficulty can be raised by these. Neither can that be the case with
some other circumstances which are related by them in somewhat different
terms, for the sense still remains the same.
