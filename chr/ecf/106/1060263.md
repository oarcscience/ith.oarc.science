id="vii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Sermon XLIV.</span>

<span id="vii.xlvi-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.xlvi-p2.1"></span>\[XCIV. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.xlvi-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xlvi-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. xxv.
24](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#024.md)<span id="vii.xlvi-p3.2"></span>,
etc., where the slothful servant who would not put out the talent he had
received, is condemned.*

<span id="vii.xlvi-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xlvi-p4.1"></span>My</span> lords, my brethren, and fellow
bishops have deigned to visit us and gladden us by their presence; but I
know not why they are unwilling to assist me, when wearied. I have said
this to you, Beloved, in their hearing, that your hearing may in a
manner intercede for me with them, that when I ask them they also may
discourse unto you in their turn. Let them dispense what they have
received, let them vouchsafe to work rather than excuse themselves. Be
pleased, however, to hear from me, fatigued though I be and have
difficulty in speaking, a few words only. For we have besides a record
of God’s mercies vouchsafed through a holy Martyr, which we must give
willing audience to altogether. <span
id="fr_3131"></span>[3132](#fn_3131.md) What is it then? what shall I say
unto you? Ye have heard in the Gospel both the due recompense <span
id="fr_3132"></span>[3133](#fn_3132.md) of the good servants, and the
punishment of the bad. And the whole wickedness of that servant who was
reprobate and severely condemned, was that he would not put out his
money to use. He kept the entire sum he had received; but the Lord
looked for profit from it. God is coveteous with regard to our
salvation. If he who did not put out to use is so condemned, what must
they look for who lose what they have received? We then are the
dispensers, we put out, ye receive. We look for profit; do ye live well.
For this is the profit <span id="page_406">p. 406</span> <span
id="vii.xlvi-Page_406"></span>in our dealings with you. But do not think
that this office of putting out to use does not belong to you also. Ye
cannot execute it indeed from this elevated seat, but ye can wherever ye
chance to be. Wherever Christ is attacked, defend Him; answer murmurers,
rebuke blasphemers, from their fellowship keep yourselves apart. So do
ye put out to use, if ye make gain of any. Discharge our office in your
own houses. A bishop is called from hence, because he superintends,
because he takes care and attends to others. To every man then, if he is
the head of his own house, ought the office of the Episcopate to belong,
to take care how his household believe, that none of them fall into
heresy, neither wife, nor son, nor daughter, nor even his slave, because
he has been bought at so great a price. The Apostolic teaching has set
the master over the slave, and put the slave under the master;  <span
id="fr_3133"></span>[3134](#fn_3133.md) nevertheless Christ gave the same
price for both. Do not neglect then the least of those belonging to you,
look after the salvation of all your household with all vigilance. This
if ye do, ye put out to use; ye will not be slothful servants, ye will
not have to fear so horrible a condemnation.
