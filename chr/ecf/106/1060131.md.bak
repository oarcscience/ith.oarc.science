<span id="vi.v.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—Of the Passage in Which It is
Said that the Disciples Plucked the Ears of Corn and Ate Them; And of
the Question as to How Matthew, Mark, and Luke are in Harmony with Each
Other with Respect to the Order of Narration There.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxxv-p2"></span>81. Matthew continues his history in the
following terms: “At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath-day through the
corn; and His disciples were an hungered, and began to pluck the ears of
corn, and to eat;” and so forth, on to the words, “For the Son of man is
Lord even of the Sabbath-day.” <span id="fr_999"></span>[1000](#fn_999.md)
This is also given both by Mark and by Luke, in a way precluding any
idea of antagonism. <span id="fr_1000"></span>[1001](#fn_1000.md) At the
same time, these latter do not employ the definition “at that time.”
That fact, consequently, may perhaps make it the more probable that
Matthew has retained the order of actual occurrence here, and that the
others have kept by the order of their own recollections; unless,
indeed, this phrase “at that time” is to be taken in a broader sense,
that is to say, as indicating the period at which these many and various
incidents took place.  <span id="fr_1001"></span>[1002](#fn_1001.md)
