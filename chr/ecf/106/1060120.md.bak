<span id="vi.v.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Of the Person Who Said to the
Lord, “I Will Follow Thee Whithersoever Thou Goest;” And of the Other
Things Connected Therewith, and of the Order in Which They are Recorded
by Matthew and Luke.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxiv-p2"></span>54. He next appends the following
statement: “And a certain scribe came and said unto Him, Master, I will
follow Thee whithersoever thou goest;” and so on, down to the words,
“Let the dead bury their dead.” <span id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887.md)
We have a narrative in similar terms also in Luke. But he <span
id="page_129">p. 129</span> <span id="vi.v.xxiv-Page_129"></span>inserts
it only after a variety of other matters, and without any explicit note
of the order of time, but after the fashion of one only bethinking
himself of the incident at that point. He leaves us also uncertain
whether he brings it in there as something previously omitted, or as an
anticipatory notice of something which in actual fact took place
subsequently to those incidents by which it is followed in the history.
For he proceeds thus: “And it came to pass, that as they went in the
way, a certain man said unto Him, I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou
goest.” <span id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888.md) And the Lord’s answer is
given here in precisely the same terms as we find recited in Matthew.
Now, although Matthew tells us that this took place at the time when He
gave commandment to depart unto the other side of the lake, and Luke, on
the other hand, speaks of an occasion when they “went in the way,” there
is no necessary contradiction in that. For it may be the case that they
went in the way just in order to come to the lake. Again, in what is
said about the person who begged to be allowed first to bury his father,
Matthew and Luke are thoroughly at one. For the mere fact that Matthew
has introduced first the words of the man who made the request regarding
his father, and that he has put after that the saying of the Lord,
“Follow me,” whereas Luke puts the Lord’s command, “Follow me,” first,
and the declaration of the petitioner second, is a matter of no
consequence to the sense itself. Luke has also made mention of yet
another person, who said, “Lord, I will follow Thee, but let me first
bid them farewell which are at home at my house;” <span
id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889.md) of which individual Matthew says
nothing. And thereafter Luke proceeds to another subject altogether, and
not to what followed in the actual order of time. The passage runs:
“*And after these things*, the Lord appointed other seventy-two
also.” <span id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890.md) That this occurred “after
these things” is indeed manifest; but at what length of time after these
things the Lord did so is not apparent. Nevertheless, in this interval
that took place which Matthew subjoins next in succession. For the same
Matthew still keeps up the order of time, and continues his narrative,
as we shall now see.
