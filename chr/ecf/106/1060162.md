<span id="vi.v.lxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXV.—Of the Absence of Any Antagonism
Between Matthew and Mark, or Between Matthew and Luke, in the Account
Offered of the Giving of Sight to the Blind Men of Jericho.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxvi-p2"></span>125. Matthew continues thus: “And as they
departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed Him. And, behold, two
blind men sitting by the wayside heard that Jesus passed by, and cried
out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David;” and so on,
down to the words, “And immediately their eyes received sight, and they
followed Him.” <span id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124.md) Mark also
records this incident, but mentions only one blind <span
id="page_158">p. 158</span> <span
id="vi.v.lxvi-Page_158"></span>man. <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125.md) This difficulty is solved in the
way in which a former difficulty was explained which met us in the case
of the two persons who were tormented by the legion of devils in the
territory of the Gerasenes. <span id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md)
For, that in this instance also of the two blind men whom he \[Matthew\]
alone has introduced here, one of them was of pre-eminent note and
repute in that city, is a fact made clear enough by the single
consideration, that Mark has recorded both his own name and his
father’s; a circumstance which scarcely comes across us in all the many
cases of healing which had been already performed by the Lord, unless
that miracle be an exception, in the recital of which the evangelist has
mentioned by name Jairus, the ruler of the synagogue, whose daughter
Jesus restored to life. <span id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127.md) And
in this latter instance this intention becomes the more apparent, from
the fact that the said ruler of the synagogue was certainly a man of
rank in the place. Consequently there can be little doubt that this
Bartimæus, the son of Timæus, had fallen from some position of great
prosperity, and was now regarded as an object of the most notorious and
the most remarkable wretchedness, because, in addition to being blind,
he had also to sit begging. And this is also the reason, then, why Mark
has chosen to mention only the one whose restoration to sight acquired
for the miracle a fame as widespread as was the notoriety which the
man’s misfortune itself had gained.

<span id="vi.v.lxvi-p7"></span>126. But Luke, although he mentions an
incident altogether of the same tenor, is nevertheless to be understood
as really narrating only a similar miracle which was wrought in the case
of another blind man, and as putting on record its similarity to the
said miracle in the method of performance. For he states that it was
performed when He was coming nigh unto Jericho; <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128.md) while the others say that it took
place when He was departing from Jericho. Now the name of the city, and
the resemblance in the deed, favour the supposition that there was but
one such occurrence. But still, the idea that the evangelists really
contradict each other here, in so far as the one says, “As He was come
nigh unto Jericho,” while the others put it thus, “As He came out of
Jericho,” is one which no one surely will be prevailed on to accept,
unless those who would have it more readily credited that the gospel is
unveracious, than that He wrought two miracles of a similar nature and
in similar circumstances. <span id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129.md) But
every faithful son of the gospel will most readily perceive which of
these two alternatives is the more credible, and which the rather to be
accepted as true; and, indeed, every gainsayer too, when he is advised
concerning the real state of the case, will answer himself either by the
silence which he will have to observe, or at least by the tenor of his
reflections should he decline to be silent.
