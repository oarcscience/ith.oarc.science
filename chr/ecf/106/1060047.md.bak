<span id="v.iii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xvii-p2"></span>56. For in the case of those who are
seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, *i.e.* who are
preferring this to all other things, so that for its sake they are
seeking the other things, there ought not to remain behind the anxiety
lest those things should fail which are necessary to this life for the
sake of the kingdom of God. For He has said above, “Your Father knoweth
that ye have need of all these things.” And therefore, when He had said,
“Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,” He did not
say, Then seek such things (although they are necessary), but He affirms
“all these things shall be added unto you,” <span
id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md) *i.e.* will follow, if ye seek the
former, without any hindrance on your part: lest while ye seek such
things, ye should be turned away from the other; or lest ye should set
up two things to be aimed at, so as to seek both the kingdom of God for
its own sake, and such necessaries: but these rather for the sake of
that other; so shall they not be wanting to you. For ye cannot serve two
masters. But the man is attempting to serve two masters, who seeks both
the kingdom of God as a great good, and these temporal things. He will
not, however, be able to have a single eye, and to serve the Lord God
alone, unless he take all other things, so far as they are necessary,
for the sake of this one thing, *i.e.* for the sake of the kingdom of
God. But as all who serve as soldiers receive provisions and pay, so all
who preach the gospel receive food and clothing. But all do not serve as
soldiers for the welfare of the republic, but some do so for what they
get: so also all do not minister to God for the welfare of the Church,
but some do so for the sake of these temporal things, which they are to
obtain in the shape as it were of provisions and pay; or both for the
one thing and for the other. But it has been already said above, “Ye
cannot serve two masters.” Hence it is with a single heart and only for
the sake of the kingdom of God that we ought to do good to all; and we
ought not in doing so to think either of the temporal reward alone, or
of that along with the kingdom of God: all which temporal things He has
placed under the category of to-morrow, saying, “Take no thought for
to-morrow.” <span id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md) For to-morrow is not
spoken of except in time, where the future succeeds the past. Therefore,
when we do anything good, let us not think of what is temporal, but of
what is eternal; then will that be a good and perfect work. “For the
morrow,” says He, “will be anxious for the things of itself;” <span
id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md) *i.e.*, so that, when you ought, you
will take food, or drink, or clothing, that is to say, when necessity
itself begins to urge you. For these things will be within reach,
because our Father knoweth that we have need of all these things. For
“sufficient unto the day,” says He, “is the evil thereof;” <span
id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) *i.e.* it is sufficient that necessity
itself will urge us to take such things. And for this reason, I suppose,
it is called evil, because for us it is penal: for it belongs to this
frailty and mortality which we have earned by sinning. Do not add,
therefore, to this punishment of temporal necessity anything more
burdensome, so that you should not only suffer the want of such things,
but should also for the purpose of satisfying this want enlist as a
soldier for God.

<span id="v.iii.xvii-p7"></span>57. In the use of this passage, however,
we must be very specially on our guard, lest perchance, when we see any
servant of God making provision that such necessaries shall not be
wanting either to himself or to those with whose care he has been
entrusted, we should decide that he is acting contrary to the Lord’s
precept, and is anxious for the morrow. <span
id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md) For the Lord Himself also, although
angels ministered to Him, <span id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md) yet
for the sake of example, that no one might afterwards be scandalized
when he observed any of His servants procuring such necessaries,
condescended to have money bags, out of which whatever might be required
for necessary uses might be provided; of which bags, as it is written,
Judas, who betrayed Him, was the keeper and the thief. <span
id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md) In like manner, the Apostle Paul also
may seem to have taken <span id="page_53">p. 53</span> <span
id="v.iii.xvii-Page_53"></span>thought for the morrow, when he said:
“Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to
the saints of Galatia, even so do ye: upon the first day of the week let
every one of you lay by him in store <span
id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md) what shall seem good unto him, that
there be no gatherings when I come. And when I come <span
id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) whomsoever ye shall approve by your
letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. And
if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. Now I will come
unto you when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I shall pass through
Macedonia. And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you,
that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. For I will not
see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the
Lord permit. But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.” <span
id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md) In the Acts of the Apostles also it is
written, that such things as are necessary for food were provided for
the future, on account of an impending famine. For we thus read: “And in
these days came prophets down from Jerusalem to Antioch, <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) and there was great rejoicing. And
when we were gathered together, <span id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md)
there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit
that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came
to pass in the days of Claudius Cæsar. Then the disciples, every one
according to his ability, determined to send relief to the elders for
the brethren which dwelt in Judæa, which also they did by the hands of
Barnabas and Saul.” <span id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md) And in the
case of the necessaries presented to him, wherewith the same Apostle
Paul when setting sail was laden, <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) food seems to have been furnished for
more than a single day. And when the same apostle writes, “Let him that
stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working <span
id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) with his hands the thing which is
good, that he may have to give to him that needeth;” <span
id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) to those who misunderstand him he does
not seem to keep the Lord’s precept, which runs, “Behold the fowls of
the air; for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns;”
and, “Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not,
neither do they spin;” while he enjoins the parties in question to
labour, working with their hands, that they may have something which
they may be able to give to others also. And in what he often says of
himself, that he wrought with his hands that he might not be
burdensome; <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md) and in what is
written of him, that he joined himself to Aquila on account of the
similarity of their occupation, in order that they might work together
at that from which they might make a living; <span
id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) he does not seem to have imitated the
birds of the air and the lilies of the field. From these and such like
passages of Scripture, it is sufficiently apparent that our Lord does
not disapprove of it, when one looks after such things in the ordinary
way that men do; but only when one enlists as a soldier of God for the
sake of such things, so that in what he does he fixes his eye not on the
kingdom of God, but on the acquisition of such things.

<span id="v.iii.xvii-p22"></span>58. Hence this whole precept is reduced
to the following rule, that even in looking after such things we should
think of the kingdom of God, but in the service of the kingdom of God we
should not think of such things. For in this way, although they should
sometimes be wanting (a thing which God often permits for the purpose of
exercising us), they not only do not weaken our proposition, but even
strengthen it, when it is examined and tested. For, says He, “we glory
in tribulations also; knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and
patience experience, and experience hope: And hope maketh not ashamed,
because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
which is given unto us.” <span id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) Now, in
the mention of his tribulations and labours, the same apostle mentions
that he has had to endure not only prisons and shipwrecks and many such
like annoyances, but also hunger and thirst, cold and nakedness. <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) But when we read this, let us not
imagine that the promises of God have wavered, so that the apostle
suffered hunger and thirst and nakedness while seeking the kingdom and
righteousness of God, although it is said to us, “Seek ye first the
kingdom of God and His righteousness; and all these things shall be
added unto you:” since that Physician to whom we have once for all
entrusted ourselves wholly, and from whom we have the promise of life
present and future, knows such things just as helps, when He sets them
before us, when He takes them away, just as He judges it expedient for
us; whom He rules and directs as parties who require both to be
comforted and exercised in this life, and after this life to be
established and confirmed in perpetual rest. For man also, when he
frequently takes away the fodder from his beast of burden, is not
depriving it of his care, but rather does what he is doing in the
exercise of care.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_405"></span>[52:406](1060047.htm#fr_405.md) <span
id="v.iii.xvii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.xvii-p3"></span> Nor is it said, “Seek…in *order that*
all these things may be added:” simply, “*and all*,” etc., yet largely
inclusive,—sanctity *and* comfort. The comfort follows naturally. The
passage is a rebuke to those who condemn the amenities of life and art,
and a caution to those who place these things before themselves as a
chief end. The passage justifies the statement that religion (or
godliness) is profitable for the life that now is. The Psalmist never
saw the *righteous* forsaken. A traditional saying of Jesus, quoted by
Clement, Origen, and Eusebius, runs, “Ask great things, and little
things shall be added; ask heavenly things, and earthly things shall be
added.”

<span id="fn_406"></span>[52:407](1060047.htm#fr_406.md) <span
id="v.iii.xvii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.xvii-p4"></span> *Cogitare in crastino*; Vulgate,
*solliciti esse in crastinum*. There is no uniformity in Augustin’s or
the Vulgate’s translation of the Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.xvii-p4.1"></span>μεριμνάω</span> (“take anxious thought”) in
this passage.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[52:408](1060047.htm#fr_407.md) <span
id="v.iii.xvii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="v.iii.xvii-p5"></span> The morrow will bring its own vexations
and anxieties. The English version entirely misleads as to the meaning
of the special clause, “will take care of itself.” The Revised Version
is a literal translation, and at least gives the true sense by
implication. But with each day’s temptations and troubles, it is
implied, special enablement and deliverance will be provided.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[52:409](1060047.htm#fr_408.md) <span
id="v.iii.xvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.xvii-p6"></span> Wiclif, following the Vulgate,
translates *malice*; Tyndale, *trouble*; the Genevan Bible, *grief*.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[52:410](1060047.htm#fr_409.md) <span
id="v.iii.xvii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.xvii-p8"></span> Our Lord’s precept is not against
provident forethought,—of which Augustin goes on to give examples,—but
against anxious thought which implies distrust of God’s providence.
Anxious, fretful, distrustful care for the future, unreliant upon God’s
bounty, wisdom, and love (as implied in the address, *your heavenly
Father*) is declared to be unnecessary (25, 26), foolish (27–30), and
heathenish (32, “After these things do the Gentiles seek”). The passages
teach trust in God, who is more interested in His children than in the
fowls of the air, and will certainly take care of them.
