id="iii-p3.1"></span>This</span> volume contains the exegetical and
homiletical writings of St. Augustin on the Gospels.

<span id="iii-p4"></span>The seventh volume will be devoted to his
Commentary on the Gospel and First Epistle of John, and the Soliloquies.
It will be finished by the 1st of next April.

<span id="iii-p5"></span>The eighth and last volume is reserved for his
Commentary on the Psalms, and will appear in July, 1888.

<span id="iii-p6"></span>These eight volumes will form the most complete
edition of St. Augustin’s Works in the English language, embracing the
Edinburgh and Oxford translations, and several treatises never before
translated, with introductions and explanatory notes.

<span id="iii-p7"></span>Arrangements have been made for the regular
issue of the Works of St. Chrysostom according to the terms of the
Publisher’s Prospectus, which so far has been promptly carried out. The
favourable reception of the preceding volumes by the public and the
press, including some leading theological journals of Europe (such as
*The Church Quarterly Review*, and Harnack’s *<span
id="iii-p7.1"></span>Theologische Literaturzeitung*), will encourage the
editor and publisher to carry on this Patristic Library with
undiminished energy and zeal.
