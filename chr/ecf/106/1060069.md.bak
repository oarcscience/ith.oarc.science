id="vi.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Of Certain Persons Who Pretend
that Christ Wrote Books on the Arts of Magic.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p2"></span>14. But, indeed, these persons rise to
such a pitch of folly as to allege that the books which they consider to
have been written by Him contain the arts by which they think He wrought
those miracles, the fame of which has become prevalent in all quarters.
And this fancy of theirs betrays what they really love, and what their
aims really are. For thus, indeed, they show us how they entertain this
opinion that Christ was the wisest of men only for the reason that He
possessed the knowledge of I know not what illicit arts, which are
justly condemned, not merely by Christian discipline, but even by the
administration of earthly government itself. And, in good sooth, if
there are people who affirm that they have read books of this nature
composed by Christ, then why do they not perform with their own hand
some such works as those which so greatly excite their wonder when
wrought by Him, by taking advantage of the information which they have
derived from these books?
