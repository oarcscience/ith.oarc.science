id="vi.vi.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Of Christ’s Subsequent
Manifestations of Himself to the Disciples, and of the Question Whether
a Thorough Harmony Can Be Established Between the Different Narratives
When the Notices Given by the Four Several Evangelists, as Well as Those
Presented by the Apostle Paul and in the Acts of the Apostles, are
Compared Together.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p2"></span>70. We must take up the consideration of
the manner in which the Lord showed Himself to the disciples after His
resurrection, and that with the view not only of bringing out clearly
the consistency of the four evangelists with each other on these
subjects, but also of exhibiting their agreement with the Apostle Paul,
who discourses of the theme in his First Epistle to the Corinthians. The
statement by the latter runs in the following terms: “For I delivered
unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died
for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and
that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures; and that
He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md) after that He was seen of above
five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this
day, but some are fallen asleep. After that, He was seen of James; then
of all the apostles. And last of all He was seen of me also, as of one
born out of due time.” <span id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md) Now
this succession of the appearances is one which has been given by none
of the evangelists. Hence we must examine whether the order which they
have put on record does not stand in antagonism to this. For neither has
Paul related all, nor have the evangelists included everything in their
reports. And the real subject for our investigation, therefore, is the
question, whether, among the incidents which do come under our notice in
these various narratives, there is anything fitted to establish a
discrepancy between the writers. Now Luke is the only one among the four
evangelists who omits to tell us how the Lord was seen by the women, and
confines his statement to the appearance of the angels. Matthew, again,
informs us that He met them as they were returning from the sepulchre.
Mark likewise mentions that He appeared first to Mary Magdalene; as also
does John. Only Mark does not state how He manifested Himself to her,
while John does give us an explanation of that. Moreover, Luke not only
passes by in silence the fact that He showed Himself to the women, as I
have already remarked, but also reports that two disciples, one of whom
was Cleophas, talked with Him, before they recognised Him, in a strain
which seems to imply that the women had related no other appearance seen
by them than that of the angels who told them that He was alive. For
Luke’s narrative proceeds thus: “And, behold, two of them went that same
day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about
threescore furlongs. And they talked together of all these things which
had happened. And it came to pass that, while they communed together and
reasoned, Jesus Himself drew near, and went with them. But their eyes
were holden, that they should not know Him. And He said unto them, What
manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye
walk, and are sad? And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas,
answering, said unto Him, Art thou only a stranger  <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md) in Jerusalem, and hast not known
the things which are come to pass there in these days? And He said unto
them, What things? And they said unto Him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth,
which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the
people; and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be
condemned to death, and have crucified Him. But we trusted that it had
been He that should have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, to-day
is the third day since these things were done. Yea, and certain women
also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the
sepulchre; and when they found not His body, they came, saying, that
they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that He was alive. And
certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it
even so as the women said; but Him they saw <span
id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520.md) not.” <span
id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521.md) All these things they relate,
according to Luke’s narrative, just as they were able to command their
recollections and bethink themselves of what had been reported to them
by the women, or by the disciples who had run to the sepulchre when the
intelligence was conveyed to them that His body had been removed from
the place. It is at the same time true that Luke himself reports only
Peter to have run to the tomb, and there to have stooped down and seen
the linen clothes laid by themselves, and then to have departed,
wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. This notice about
Peter, moreover, is introduced previous to the narrative of these two
disciples whom He found on the way, and subsequently to the story of the
women who had seen the angels, and who had heard from them that Jesus
had risen again; so that this position might seem to mark the period at
which Peter ran to the sepulchre. But still we must suppose that Luke
has inserted the passage about Peter here in the form of a
recapitulation. For the time when Peter ran to the sepulchre was <span
id="page_215">p. 215</span> <span id="vi.vi.xxvi-Page_215"></span>also
the time when John ran to it; and at that point all that they had heard
was simply the statement conveyed to them by the women, and in
particular by Mary Magdalene, to the effect that the body had been
carried away. Furthermore, the period at which the said woman brought
such tidings was just the occasion when she saw the stone rolled away
from the sepulchre. And it was at a later point that these other things
occurred, connected with the vision of the angels, and the appearance of
the Lord Himself, who showed Himself twice over to the women, namely,
once at the sepulchre, and a second time when He met them as they were
returning from the tomb. This, however, took place previous to His being
seen by those two upon the journey, one of whom was Cleophas. For, when
this Cleophas was talking with the Lord, before he recognized who He
was, he did not say expressly that Peter had gone to the sepulchre. But
his words were these: “Certain of them which were with us went to the
sepulchre, and found it even so as the women said;” which last statement
is also to be understood as introduced in the form of a recapitulation.
For the reference is to the report brought first of all by the women to
Peter and John about the removal of the body. And thus, when Luke here
informs us that Peter ran to the sepulchre, and also states how Cleophas
mentioned that some of those who were with them went to the tomb, he is
to be taken as attesting John’s account, which bears that two persons
proceeded to the sepulchre. But Luke has specified Peter alone in the
first instance, just because it was to him that Mary had brought the
earliest tidings. A difficulty, however, may also be felt in the
circumstance that the same Luke does not say that Peter entered, but
only that he stooped down and saw the linen clothes hid by themselves,
and that thereupon he departed, wondering in himself; whereas John
intimates that it was rather himself (for he is the disciple whom Jesus
loved) that looked at the scene in this fashion, not going within the
sepulchre, which he was the first to reach, but simply bending down and
beholding the linen clothes laid in their place; although he also adds
that he did enter the tomb afterwards. The explanation, therefore, is
simply this, that Peter at first did stoop down and look in after the
fashion which Luke specifies, but to which John makes no allusion; and
that he went actually in somewhat later, but still before John entered.
And in this way we shall find that all these writers have given a true
account of what occurred in terms which betray no discrepancies. <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522.md)

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p9"></span>71. Taking, then, not only the reports
presented by the four evangelists, but also the statement given by the
Apostle Paul, we shall endeavour to bring the whole into a single
connected narrative, and exhibit the order in which all these incidents
may have taken place, comprehending all the Lord’s appearances to the
male disciples, and leaving out His earlier declarations to the women.
Now, in the entire number of the men, Peter is understood to be the one
to whom Christ showed Himself first. At least, this holds good so far as
regards all the individuals who are actually mentioned by the four
evangelists, and by the Apostle Paul. But, at the same time, who would
be bold enough either to affirm or to deny that He may have appeared to
some one among them before He showed Himself to Peter, although all
these writers pass the matter over in silence? For the statement which
Paul also gives is not in the form, “He was seen first of Cephas.” But
it runs thus: “He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that He
was seen of above five hundred brethren at once.” And thus it is not
made clear who these twelve were, just as we are not informed who these
five hundred were. It is quite possible, indeed, that the twelve here
instanced were some unknown twelve belonging to the multitude of the
disciples. For now the apostle might speak of those whom the Lord
designated apostles, not as the twelve, but as the eleven. Some codices,
indeed, contain this very reading. I take that, however, to be an
emendation introduced by men who were perplexed by the text, supposing
it to refer to those twelve apostles who, by the time when Judas
disappeared, were really only eleven. It may be the case, then, that
those are the more correct codices which contain the reading “eleven;”
or it may be that Paul intended some other twelve disciples to be
understood by that phrase; <span id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523.md)
or, once more, the fact may be that he meant that consecrated
number <span id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524.md) to remain as before,
although the circle had been reduced to eleven: for this number twelve,
as it was used of the apostles, had so mystical an importance, that, in
order to keep the spiritual symbol of the same number, there could be
but a single individual, namely, Matthias, elected to fill the place of
Judas. <span id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525.md) But whichever of these
several views may be adopted, nothing necessarily results which can
appear to be inconsistent with truth, or at variance with any one most
trustworthy historian among them. Still, it remains the probable
supposition, that, after He was seen of Peter, He appeared next to those
two, of whom Cleophas was one, and regarding whom Luke <span
id="page_216">p. 216</span> <span
id="vi.vi.xxvi-Page_216"></span>presents us with a complete narrative,
while Mark gives us only a very brief notice. The latter
evangelist <span id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526.md) reports the same
incident in these concise terms: “And after that He appeared in another
form unto two of them, as they walked and went to a country-seat.” <span
id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527.md) For it is not unreasonable for us
to suppose that the place of residence <span
id="fr_1528"></span>[1529](#fn_1528.md) referred to may also have been
styled a country-seat; <span id="fr_1529"></span>[1530](#fn_1529.md) just
as Bethlehem itself, which formerly was called a city, is even at the
present time also named a village, although its honour has now been made
so much the greater since the name of this Lord, who was born in it, has
been proclaimed so extensively throughout the Churches of all nations.
In the Greek codices, indeed, the reading which we discover is rather
“estate” <span id="fr_1530"></span>[1531](#fn_1530.md) than “country-seat.”
But that term was employed not only of residences, <span
id="fr_1531"></span>[1532](#fn_1531.md) but also of free towns <span
id="fr_1532"></span>[1533](#fn_1532.md) and colonies beyond the city, which
is the head and mother of the rest, and is therefore called the
metropolis.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p20"></span>72. Again, if Mark tells us that the
Lord appeared to these persons in another form, Luke refers to the same
when he says that their eyes, were holden, that they should not know
Him. For something had come upon their eyes which was suffered to remain
until the breaking of the bread, in reference to a well-known mystery,
so that only then was the different form in Him made visible to them,
and they did not recognise Him, as is shown by Luke’s narrative, until
the breaking of the bread took place. And thus, in apt accordance with
the state of their minds, which were still ignorant of the truth, that
it behoved Christ to die and rise again, their eyes sustained something
of a similar order; not, indeed, that the truth itself proved
misleading, but that they were themselves incompetent to perceive the
truth, and thought of the matter as something else than it was. The
deeper significance of all which is this, that no one should consider
himself to have attained the knowledge of Christ, if he is not a member
in His body—that is to say, in His Church—the unity of which is
commended to our notice under the sacramental symbol of the bread by an
apostle, when he says: “We being many are one bread and one body.” <span
id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533.md) So was it that, when He handed to
them the bread which He had blessed, their eyes were opened, and they
recognised Him, that is to say, their eyes were opened for such
knowledge of Him, in so far as the impediment was now removed which had
prevented them from recognising Him. For certainly they were not walking
with closed eyes. But there was something in them which debarred them
from seeing correctly what was in their view,—a state of matters,
indeed, which is the familiar result of darkness, or of a certain kind
of humour. It is not meant by this, however, that the Lord could not
alter the form of His flesh, so that His figure might be literally and
actually different, and not the one which they were in the habit of
beholding. For, indeed, even before His passion, He was transfigured on
the mount so that His countenance “did shine as the sun.” <span
id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534.md) And He who made genuine wine out of
genuine water can also transform any body whatsoever in all
unquestionable reality into any other kind of body which may please Him.
But what is meant is, that He had not acted so when He appeared in
another form unto those two individuals. For He did not appear to be
what He was <span id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535.md) to these men,
because their eyes were holden, so that they should not know Him.
Moreover, not unsuitably may we suppose that this impediment in their
eyes came from Satan, with the view of precluding their recognition of
Jesus. But, nevertheless, permission that it should be so was given by
Christ on to the point at which the mystery of the bread was taken up.
And thus the lesson might be, that it is when we become participants in
the unity of His body, that we are to understand the impediment of the
adversary to be removed, and liberty to be given us to know Christ.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p24"></span>73. Besides, it is necessary to believe
that these were the same persons to whom Mark also refers. For he
informs us, that they went and told these things to the rest: just as
Luke states, that the persons in question rose up the same hour and
returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them
that were with them, saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and hath
appeared to Simon.” <span id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536.md) And then
he adds that these two also told what things were done on the way, and
how He was known of them in breaking of bread. <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537.md) By this time, therefore, a report
of the resurrection of Jesus had been conveyed by those women, and also
by Simon Peter, to whom He had already shown Himself. For these two
disciples found those to whom they came in Jerusalem talking of that
very subject. Consequently, it may be the case that fear made them
decline mentioning formerly, when they were on the way, that they had
heard that He had risen again, so that they confined themselves to
stating how the angels had been seen by the women. For, not knowing with
whom they were conversing, they might reasonably be anxious not to let
any word drop from them on the subject of Christ’s resurrec<span
id="page_217">p. 217</span> <span id="vi.vi.xxvi-Page_217"></span>tion,
lest they should fall into the hands of the Jews. But again, we must
remark that Mark states that “they went and told it unto the residue:
neither believed they them:” <span id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md)
whereas Luke tells us that these others were already saying that the
Lord was risen indeed, and had appeared unto Simon. Is not the
explanation, however, simply this, that there were some of them there
who refused to credit what was related? Moreover, to whom can it fail to
be clear that Mark has just omitted certain matters which are fully set
forth in Luke’s narrative,—that is to say, the subjects of the
conversation which Jesus had with them before He recognised them, and
the manner in which they came to know Him in the breaking of the bread?
For, after recording how He appeared to them in another form, as they
went towards a country-seat, Mark has immediately appended the sentence,
“And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they
them;” as if men could tell of a person whom they had not recognised, or
as if those to whom He had appeared only in another form could know Him!
Without doubt, therefore, Mark has simply given us no explanation of the
way in which they came to know Him, so as to be able to report the same
to others. And this, then, is a thing which deserves to be imprinted on
our memory, in order that we may accustom ourselves to keep in view the
habit which these evangelists have of passing over those matters which
they do not put on record, and of connecting the facts which they do
relate in such a manner that, among those who fail to give due
consideration to the usage referred to, nothing proves itself a more
fruitful source of misapprehension than this, leading them to imagine
the existence of discrepancies in the sacred writers.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p28"></span>74. Luke next proceeds with his
narrative in the following terms: “And as they thus spake, Jesus Himself
stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you: it
is I; be not afraid. <span id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539.md) But they
were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
And He said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in
your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me
and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. And
when He had thus spoken, He showed them His hands and His feet.” <span
id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540.md) It is to this act, by which the
Lord showed Himself after His resurrection, that John is also understood
to refer when he discourses as follows: “Then, when it was late on the
first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples
were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus, and stood in the midst,
and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. And when He had so said, He
showed unto them His hands and His side.” <span
id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541.md) Thus, too, we may connect with
these words of John certain matters which Luke reports, but which John
Himself omits. For Luke continues in these terms: “And while they yet
believed not for joy, and wondered, He said unto them, Have ye here any
meat? And they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
And when He had eaten before them, He took what remained, <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542.md) and gave it unto them.” <span
id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md) Again, a passage which Luke omits,
but which John presents, may next be connected with these words. It is
to the following effect: “Then were the disciples glad when they saw the
Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father
hath sent me, even so send I you. And when He had said this, He breathed
on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: Whose soever
sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye
retain, they are retained.” <span id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md)
Once more, we may attach to the above section another which John has
left out, but which Luke inserts. It runs thus: “And He said unto them,
These are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you,
that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of
Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me. Then
opened He their understanding, that they might understand the
Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved
Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that
repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among
all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these
things. And I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in
the city, until ye be endued with power from on high.” <span
id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md) Observe, then, how Luke has here
referred to that promise of the Holy Spirit which we do not elsewhere
find made by the Lord, save in John’s Gospel. <span
id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546.md) And this deserves something more
than a passing notice, in order that we may bear in mind how the
evangelists attest each other’s truth, even on subjects which some of
them may not themselves record, but which they nevertheless know to have
been reported. After these matters, Luke passes over in silence all else
that happened, and introduces nothing into his nar<span id="page_218">p.
218</span> <span id="vi.vi.xxvi-Page_218"></span>rative beyond the
occasion when Jesus ascended into heaven. And at the same time he
appends this \[statement of the ascension\], just as if it followed
immediately upon these words which the Lord spake, at the same time with
those other transactions on the first day of the week, that is to say,
on the day on which the Lord rose again; whereas, in the Acts of the
Apostles, <span id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547.md) the self-same Luke
tells us that the event really took place on the fortieth day after His
resurrection. Finally, as regards the fact that John states that the
Apostle Thomas was not present with these others on the occasion under
review, whereas, according to Luke, the two disciples, of whom Cleophas
was one, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven assembled and those
who were with them, it admits of little doubt that we must suppose
Thomas simply to have left the company before the Lord showed Himself to
the brethren when they were talking in the terms noticed above.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p38"></span>75. This being the case, John now
records a second manifestation of Himself, which was vouchsafed by the
Lord to the disciples eight days after, on which occasion Thomas also
was present, who had not seen Him up to that time. The narrative
proceeds thus: “And after eight days again His disciples were within,
and Thomas with them. Then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood
in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. Then saith He to Thomas,
Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand,
and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. Thomas
answered and said unto Him, My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto Him,
Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they
that have not seen, and yet have believed.” <span
id="fr_1548"></span>[1549](#fn_1548.md) This second appearance of the Lord
among the disciples—that is to say, the appearance which John records in
the second instance—we might also recognise as alluded to by Mark in a
section concisely disposing of it, according to that evangelist’s habit.
A difficulty, however, is created by the circumstance that his terms are
these: “Lastly, <span id="fr_1549"></span>[1550](#fn_1549.md) He appeared
unto those eleven as they sat at meat.” <span
id="fr_1550"></span>[1551](#fn_1550.md) The difficulty does not lie in the
mere fact that John says nothing about their sitting at meat, for he
might well have omitted that; but it does rest in the use of the word
“lastly,” for that makes it seem as if He did not show Himself to them
after that occasion, whereas John still proceeds to record a third
appearance of the Lord by the sea of Tiberias. And then we have to keep
in view the fact that the same Mark tells us how Jesus “upbraided them
with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not
them which had seen Him after He was risen.” In these words he refers to
the two disciples to whom He appeared after He was risen, as they went
toward a country-seat, and to Peter, to whom the examination of Luke’s
narrative has shown us that He manifested Himself first of all \[among
the apostles\],—perhaps also to Mary Magdalene, and those other women
who were along with her on the occasion when He was seen by them at the
sepulchre, and again when He met them as they were returning on the way.
For the said Mark has constructed his record in a manner which leads him
first to insert his brief notice of the two disciples to whom He
appeared as they went toward the country-seat, and of their giving a
report to the residue and obtaining no credit, and then to subjoin in
the immediate connection this statement: “Lastly, He appeared unto the
eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and
hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen Him
after He was risen.” How, then, is this phrase “lastly” used, as if they
did not see Him subsequently to this occasion? For the last time that
the apostles saw the Lord upon the earth was really the time when He
ascended into heaven, and that event took place on the fortieth day
after His resurrection. Now, is it likely that He would upbraid them at
that period on the ground that they had not believed those who had seen
Him after He was risen, when by that time they had seen Him themselves
so often after His resurrection, and especially when they had seen Him
on the very day of His resurrection,—that is to say, on the first day of
the week, when it was now about night, as Luke and John record? It
remains for us, therefore, to suppose that, in the passage under review,
it was Mark’s intention to give a statement, in his own concise fashion,
simply on the subject of the said day of the Lord’s resurrection; that
is to say, that first day of the week on which Mary and the other women
who were along with her saw Him after daybreak, on which also Peter
beheld Him, on which likewise He appeared to the two disciples, of whom
Cleophas was one, and to whom Mark himself also seems to refer; on
which, further, when it was now about night, He showed Himself to the
eleven (Thomas, however, being excepted) and those who were with them;
and on which, finally, the persons already instanced reported to the
disciples the things which they had seen. Hence it is that he has
employed the term “*lastly,*” because the incident mentioned was the
last that took place on this same day. For the night was now coming on
by the time that the two disciples had re<span id="page_219">p.
219</span> <span id="vi.vi.xxvi-Page_219"></span>turned from the place
where they had recognised Him in the breaking of bread, and had made
their way into Jerusalem and found the eleven, as Luke tells us, and
those who were with them, speaking to each other about the Lord’s
resurrection and about His having appeared to Peter; to whom these two
also related what had occurred on the way, and how they came to know Him
in the breaking of bread. But, assuredly, there were also there some who
did not believe. Hence we see the truth of Mark’s words, “Neither
believed they them.” When these, therefore, were now sitting at meat, as
Mark informs us, and when they were talking of these subjects, as Luke
tells us, the Lord stood in their midst, and said unto them, “Peace be
unto you,” as Luke and John both record. Moreover, the doors were shut
when He entered among them, as John alone mentions. And thus, among the
words which, as Luke and John have reported, the Lord spoke to the
disciples on that occasion, this expostulation also comes in, which is
instanced by Mark, and in which He upbraided them for not believing
those who had seen Him after He was risen.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p42"></span>76. But, again, a difficulty may also
be felt in understanding how Mark says that the Lord appeared to the
eleven as they sat at meat, if the time referred to is really the
beginning of the night of that Lord’s day, as is indicated by Luke and
John. For John, indeed, tells us plainly that the Apostle Thomas was not
with them on that occasion; and we believe that he left them before the
Lord entered among them, but after the two disciples who returned from
the village had been conversing with the eleven, as we discover from
Luke. Luke, it is true, presents a point in his narrative, at which we
may fairly suppose, first, that Thomas went out while they were talking
of these subjects, and then that the Lord came in. Mark, however, who
says, “Lastly, He appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat,” compels
us to admit that Thomas also was there. But it may be the case, perhaps,
that he chose to style them the eleven, although one of the company was
absent, because the same apostolic society was designated by this number
at the time previous to the election of Matthias in the place of Judas.
Or, if there is a difficulty in accepting this explanation, we may still
suppose that, after the many manifestations in which He vouchsafed His
presence to the disciples during the forty days, He also showed Himself
on one final occasion to the eleven as they sat at meat,—that is to say,
on the fortieth day itself; and that, as He was now on the point of
leaving them and ascending into heaven, He was minded on that memorable
day specially to upbraid them with their refusal to believe those who
had seen Him after He had risen until they should first have seen Him
themselves; and this particularly because it was the case that, when
they preached the gospel subsequently to His ascension, the very
Gentiles would be ready to believe what they did not see. For, after
mentioning this upbraiding, Mark at once proceeds to subjoin this
passage: “And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach
the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be
saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” <span
id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551.md) If, therefore, they were charged to
preach that he who believes not shall be condemned, when that indeed
which he believes not is just what he has not seen, was it not meet that
they should themselves first of all be thus reproved for their own
refusal to believe those to whom the Lord had shown Himself at an
earlier stage until they should have seen Him with their own eyes?

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p44"></span>77. In what follows we have a further
recommendation to take this to have been the last manifestation of
Himself in bodily fashion which the Lord gave to the apostles. For the
same Mark continues in these terms: “And these signs shall follow them
that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak
with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any
deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick,
and they shall recover.” <span id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552.md) Then
he appends this statement: “So then, after the Lord had spoken unto
them, He was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with
them, and confirming the word by signs following.” <span
id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553.md) Now, when he says, “So then, after
the Lord had spoken unto them, He was received up into heaven,” he
appears probably enough to indicate that this was the last discourse He
held with them upon the earth. At the same time, the words do not seem
to shut us up to that idea absolutely. For what he says is not, “after
He had spoken these things unto them,” but simply, “after He had spoken
unto them;” and hence it would be quite admissible, were there any
necessity for such a theory, to suppose that this was not the last
discourse, and that that was not the last day on which He was present
with them upon the earth, but that all the matters regarding which He
spake with them in all these days may be referred to in the sentence,
“After He had spoken unto them, He was received up into heaven.” But,
inasmuch as the considerations which we have detailed above lead us
rather to conclude that this was the last day, than to suppose that the
allusion is specifically to the eleven at a time <span id="page_220">p.
220</span> <span id="vi.vi.xxvi-Page_220"></span>when, in consequence of
the absence of Thomas, they were only ten, we are of opinion that after
this discourse which Mark mentions, and with which we have to connect in
their proper order those other words, whether of the disciples or of the
Lord Himself, which are recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, <span
id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md) we must believe the Lord to have
been received up into heaven, to wit, on the fortieth day after the day
of His resurrection.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p48"></span>78. John, again, although he tells us
plainly that he has passed over many of the things which Jesus did, has
been pleased, nevertheless, to give us a narrative of a third
manifestation of Himself, which the Lord granted to the disciples after
the resurrection, namely, by the sea of Tiberias, and before seven of
the disciples,—that is to say, Peter, Thomas, Nathanael, the sons of
Zebedee, and two others who are not mentioned by name. That is the
occasion when they were engaged in fishing; when, in obedience to His
command, they cast the nets on the right side, and drew to land great
fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: when He also asked Peter three
times whether He was loved by him, and charged him to feed His sheep,
and delivered a prophecy regarding what he would suffer, and said also,
with reference to John, “Thus <span id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555.md)
I will that he tarry till I come.” And with this John has brought his
Gospel to its conclusion.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p50"></span>79. We have next to consider now what
was the occasion of His first appearance to the disciples in Galilee.
For this incident, which John narrates as the third in order, took place
in Galilee by the sea of Tiberias. And one may perceive that the scene
was in that district, if he calls to mind the miracle of the five
loaves, the narrative of which the same John commences in these terms:
“After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea
of Tiberias.” <span id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556.md) And what should
naturally be supposed to be the proper locality for His first
manifestation to the disciples after His resurrection but Galilee? This
seems to be the conclusion to which we should be led when we recollect
the words of the angel who, according to Matthew’s Gospel, addressed the
women as they came to the sepulchre. The words were these: “Fear not ye;
for I know that ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified. He is
not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the
Lord lay: and go quickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen from
the dead; and, behold, He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye
see Him: lo, I have told you.” <span
id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md) Mark presents a similar report,
whether the angel of whom he speaks be the same one or a different. His
version runs thus: “Be not affrighted: ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which
was crucified; He is risen; He is not here: behold the place where they
laid Him. But go your way, tell His disciples and Peter that He goeth
before you into Galilee: there shall ye see Him, as He said unto
you.” <span id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558.md) Now the impression
which these words seem to produce is, that Jesus was not to show Himself
to His disciples after His resurrection, but in Galilee. The appearance
thus referred to, however, is not recorded even by Mark himself, who has
informed us how He showed Himself first to Mary Magdalene in the early
morning of the first day of the week; how she went and told them that
had been with Him as they mourned and wept; how these persons refused to
believe her; how, after this, He was next seen by the two disciples who
were going to the residence in the country; how these twain reported
what had occurred to them to the residue, which, as Luke and John agree
in certifying, took place in Jerusalem on the very day of the Lord’s
resurrection, and when night was now coming on. Thereafter the same
evangelist comes next to that appearance which he calls His last, and
which was vouchsafed to the eleven as they sat at meat; and when he has
given us his account of that scene, he tells us how He was received up
into heaven, which event took place, as we know, on the Mount Olivet, at
no great distance from Jerusalem. Thus Mark nowhere relates the actual
fulfilment of that which he declares to have been announced beforehand
by the angel. Matthew, on the other hand, confines his statement to a
single occurrence, and refers to no other locality whatsoever, whether
earlier or later, where the disciples saw the Lord after He was risen,
but the Galilee which was specified in the angel’s prediction. This
evangelist, in short, first introduces his notice of the terms in which
the women were addressed by the angel; then he subjoins an account of
what happened as they were going, and how the members of the watch were
bribed to give a false report; and then he inserts his statement \[of
the appearance in Galilee\], just as if that were the very event which
followed immediately on what he has been relating. For, indeed, the
angel’s words, “He is risen; and behold, He goeth before you into
Galilee,” were really such as might make it seem reasonable to suppose
that nothing would intervene \[before that manifestation in Galilee\].
Matthew’s version, accordingly, proceeds as follows: “Then the eleven
disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had
appointed them. And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him: but some
doubted. And <span id="page_221">p. 221</span> <span
id="vi.vi.xxvi-Page_221"></span>Jesus came and spake unto them, saying,
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and
teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto
the end of the world.” <span id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559.md) In
these terms has Matthew closed his Gospel.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p55"></span>80. Thus, then, were it not that the
consideration of the narratives given by others of the evangelists led
us inevitably to examine the whole subject with greater care, we might
entertain the idea that the scene of the Lord’s first manifestation of
Himself to the disciples after His resurrection, could be nowhere else
but in Galilee. In like manner, had Mark passed over the angel’s
announcement without notice, any one might have supposed that Matthew
was induced to tell us how the disciples went away to a mountain in
Galilee, and there worshipped the Lord, by his desire to show the actual
fulfilment of the charge, and of the prediction which he had also
recorded to have been conveyed by the angel. As the case now stands,
however, Luke and John both certify with sufficient clearness, that on
the very day of His resurrection the Lord was seen by His disciples in
Jerusalem, which is at such a distance from Galilee as makes it
impossible for Him to have been seen by these same individuals in both
places in the course of a single day. In like manner, Mark, while he
does report in similar terms the announcement made by the angel, nowhere
mentions that the Lord actually was seen in Galilee by His disciples
after He was risen. These, therefore, are considerations which strongly
force upon us an inquiry into the real import of this saying, “Behold,
He goeth before you into Galilee! there shall ye see Him.” For if
Matthew himself, too, had not stated that the eleven disciples went away
into Galilee into a mountain, where Jesus had appointed them, and that
they saw Him there and worshipped Him, we might have supposed that there
was no literal fulfilment of the prediction in question, but that the
whole announcement was intended to convey a figurative meaning. And a
parallel to that we should then find in the words recorded by Luke,
namely, “Behold I cast out devils, and I do cures to-day and to-morrow,
and the third day I shall be perfected;” <span
id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560.md) which prediction certainly was not
accomplished in the letter. In like manner, if the angel had said, “He
goeth before you into Galilee, there shall ye see Him first;” or, “Only
there shall ye see Him;” or, “Nowhere else but there shall ye see Him;”
unquestionably, in that case, Matthew would have been in antagonism with
the rest of the evangelists. As the matter stands, however, the words
are simply these: “Behold, He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall
ye see Him;” and there is no statement of the precise time at which that
meeting was to take place—whether at the earliest opportunity, and
before He was seen by them elsewhere, or at a later period, and after
they had seen Him also in other places besides Galilee; and, further,
although Matthew relates that the disciples went away into Galilee into
a mountain, he neither specifies the day of that departure, nor
constructs his narrative in an order which would force upon us the
necessity of supposing that this particular event must have been
actually the first appearance. Consequently, we may conclude that
Matthew stands in no antagonism with the narratives of the other
evangelists, but that he makes it quite competent for us, in due
consistency with his own report, to understand the meaning and accept
the truth of these other accounts. At the same time, as the Lord thus
pointed, not to the place where He intended first to manifest Himself,
but to the locality of Galilee, where undoubtedly He appeared
afterwards; and as He conveyed these instructions about beholding
Himself at once through the angel, who said,” Behold, He goeth before
you into Galilee: there shall ye see Him;” and by His own words, “Go,
tell my brethren, that they go into Galilee, and there shall ye see
me;”—in these facts we find considerations which make every believer
anxious to inquire with what mystical significance all this may be
understood to have been stated.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p57"></span>81. In the first place, however, we
must also consider the question of the time at which He may thus have
shown Himself in bodily form in Galilee, according to the statement
given by Matthew in these terms: “Then the eleven disciples went away
into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them; and when
they saw Him, they worshipped Him; but some doubted.” That it was not on
the day of His resurrection is manifest. For Luke and John agree in
telling us most plainly that He was seen in Jerusalem that very day,
when the night was coming on; while Mark is not so clear on the subject.
When was it, then, that they saw the Lord in Galilee? I do not refer to
the appearance mentioned by John, by the sea of Tiberias; for on that
occasion there were only seven of them present, and they were found
fishing. But I mean the appearance detailed by Matthew, when the eleven
were on the mountain, to which Jesus had gone before them, according to
the announcement made by the angel. For the import of Matthew’s
statement appears to be this, that they found Him there just because He
had gone before them according to appointment. <span id="page_222">p.
222</span> <span id="vi.vi.xxvi-Page_222"></span>It did not take place,
then, either on the day on which He rose, or in the eight days that
followed, after which space John states that the Lord showed Himself to
the disciples, when Thomas, who had not seen Him on the day of His
resurrection, saw Him for the first time. For, surely, on the
supposition that the eleven had really seen Him on the mountain in
Galilee within the period of these eight days, it may well be asked how
Thomas, who had been of the number of these eleven, could be said to
have seen Him for the first time at the end of these eight days. To that
question there is no answer, unless, indeed, one could say that they
were not the eleven, who by that time bore the specific designation of
Apostles, but some other eleven disciples singled out of the numerous
body of His followers. For those eleven were, indeed, the only persons
who were yet called by the name of Apostles, but they were not the only
disciples. It may perhaps be the case, therefore, that the apostles are
really referred to; that not all but only some of them were there; that
there were also other disciples with them, so that the number of persons
present was made up to eleven; and that Thomas, who saw the Lord for the
first time at the end of those eight days, was absent on this occasion.
For when Mark mentions the said eleven, he does not use the general
expression “eleven,” but says explicitly, “He appeared unto *the*
eleven.” <span id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561.md) Luke, likewise, puts
it thus: “They returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered
together, and them that were with them.” There he gives us to understand
that these were *the* eleven—that is to say, the apostles. For when he
adds, “and those who were with them,” he has surely indicated plainly
enough, that those with whom these others were, were styled “the eleven”
in some eminent sense; and this leads us to understand those to be meant
who were now called distinctively Apostles. Consequently, it is quite
possible that, out of the body of apostles and other disciples, the
number of eleven disciples was made up who saw Jesus upon the mountain
in Galilee, within the space of these eight days.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p59"></span>82. But another difficulty in the way
of this settlement arises here. For, when John has recorded how the Lord
was seen, not by the eleven on the mountain, but by seven of them when
they were fishing in the sea of Tiberias, he appends the following
statement: “This is now the third time that Jesus showed Himself to His
disciples, after that He was risen from the dead.” <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md) Now, if we accept the theory that
the Lord was seen by the company of the eleven disciples within the
period of these eight days, and previous to His being seen by Thomas,
this scene by the sea of Tiberias will not be the third but the fourth
time that He showed Himself. Here, indeed, we must take care not to let
any one suppose that, in speaking of the third time, John meant that
there were in all only three appearances of the Lord. On the contrary,
we must understand him to refer to the number of the days, and not to
the number of the manifestations themselves; and, further, it is to be
observed that these days are not presented as coming in immediate
succession after each other, but as separated by intervals in accordance
with intimations given by the evangelist himself. For, keeping out of
view His appearance to the women, it is made perfectly plain in the
Gospel that He showed Himself three several times on the first day after
He was risen; namely, once to Peter; again to those two disciples, of
whom Cleophas was one; and a third time to the larger body, while they
were conversing with each other as the night came on. But all these
John, looking to the fact that they took place on a single day, reckons
as one appearance. Then he identifies a second—that is to say, an
appearance on another day—with the occasion on which Thomas also saw
Him; and he particularizes a third by the sea of Tiberias, that is to
say, not literally His third appearance, but the third day of His
self-manifestations. Thus the result is, that after all these incidents,
we are constrained to suppose this other occasion to have occurred on
which, according to Matthew, the eleven disciples saw Him on the
mountain in Galilee, to which He had gone before them according to
appointment, so that all that had been foretold, both by the angel and
by Himself, should be fulfilled even to the letter.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p61"></span>83. Consequently, in the four
evangelists we find mention made of ten distinct appearances of the Lord
to different persons after His resurrection. First, to the women near
the sepulchre. <span id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563.md) Secondly, to
the same women as they were on the way returning from the
sepulchre. <span id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md) Thirdly, to
Peter. <span id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md) Fourthly, to the two
who were going to the place in the country. <span
id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md) Fifthly, to the larger number in
Jerusalem, when Thomas was not present. <span
id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md) Sixthly, on the occasion when
Thomas saw Him. <span id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md) Seventhly, by
the sea of Tiberias. <span id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569.md)
Eighthly, on the mountain in Galilee, of which Matthew speaks. <span
id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570.md) Ninthly, at the time to which Mark
refers in the words, “Lastly, as they sat at meat,” thereby intimating
that now they were no more to eat with Him upon the earth. <span
id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571.md) Tenthly, on the same day, not now
indeed upon the earth, but lifted up in the <span id="page_223">p.
223</span> <span id="vi.vi.xxvi-Page_223"></span>cloud, as He ascended
into heaven, as Mark and Luke record. This last appearance, indeed, is
introduced by Mark, directly after he has told us how the Lord showed
Himself to them as they sat at meat. For his narrative goes on
connectedly as follows: “So then, after the Lord had spoken unto them,
He was received up into heaven.” <span
id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572.md) Luke, on the other hand, omits all
that may have passed between Him and His disciples during the forty
days, and, after giving the history of the first day of His
resurrection-life, when He showed Himself to the larger number in
Jerusalem, he silently connects therewith the closing day on which He
ascended up into heaven. His statement proceeds in this form: “And He
led them out as far as to Bethany; and He lifted up His hands, and
blessed them; and it came to pass, that while He blessed them, He was
parted from them, and carried up into heaven.” <span
id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md) Thus, therefore, besides seeing Him
upon the earth, they beheld Him also as He was borne up into heaven. So
many times, then, is He reported in the evangelical books to have been
seen by different individuals, previous to His completed ascension into
heaven, namely, nine times upon the earth, and once in the air as He was
ascending.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p73"></span>84. At the same time, all is not
recorded, as John plainly declares. <span
id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md) For He had frequent intercourse
with His disciples during the forty days which preceded His ascension
into heaven. <span id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md) He had not,
however, showed Himself to them throughout all these forty days without
interruption. For John tells us, that after the first day of His
resurrection-life, there elapsed other eight days, at the end of which
space He appeared to them again. The appearance which is identified \[in
John\] as the third—namely, the one by the sea of Tiberias—may perhaps
have taken place on an immediately succeeding day; for there is nothing
antagonistic to that. And then He showed Himself when it seemed the
proper time to Him, as He had appointed with them (which appointment had
also been conveyed in the previous prophetic announcement) to go before
them into Galilee. And all throughout these forty days, He appeared on
occasions, and to individuals, and in modes, just as He was minded. To
these appearances Peter alludes when, in the discourse which he
delivered before Cornelius and those who were withhim, he says, “Even to
us who did eat and drink with Him after He rose from the dead, for the
space of forty days.” <span id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md) It is
not meant, however, that they had eaten and drunk with Him daily
throughout these forty days. For that would be contrary to John’s
statement, who has interposed the space of eight days, during which He
was not seen, and makes His third appearance take place by the sea of
Tiberias. At the same time, even although He \[should be supposed to
have\] manifested Himself to them and lived with them every day after
that period, that would not come into antagonism with anything in the
narrative. And, perhaps, this expression, “for the space of forty days,”
which is equivalent to four times ten, and may thus sustain a mystical
reference to the whole world or the whole temporal age, has been used
just because those first ten days, within which the said eight fall, may
not incongruously be reckoned, in accordance with the practice of the
Scriptures, on the principle of dealing with the part in general terms
as the whole.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p77"></span>85. Let us therefore compare what is
said by the Apostle Paul with the view of deciding whether it raises any
question of difficulty. His statement proceeds thus: “That He rose again
the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen of
Cephas.” <span id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md) He does not say, “He
was seen *first* of Cephas.” For this would be inconsistent with the
fact that it is recorded in the Gospel that He appeared first to the
women. He continues thus: “then of the twelve;” and whoever the
individuals may have been to whom He then showed Himself, and whatever
the precise hour, this was at least on the very day of His resurrection.
Again he goes on: “After that He was seen of above five hundred brethren
at once.” And whether these were gathered together with the eleven when
the doors were shut for fear of the Jews, and when Jesus came to them
after Thomas had gone out from the company, or whether the reference is
to some other appearance subsequent to these eight days, no discrepancy
is created. Again he says, “after that He was seen of James.” We ought
not, however, to suppose this to mean that this was the first occasion
on which He was seen of James; but we may take it to allude to some
special appearance to that apostle by himself. Next he adds, “then of
all the apostles,” which does not imply that this was the first time
that He showed Himself to them, but that from this period He lived in
more familiar intercourse with them on to the day of His ascension.
Finally he says, “And last of all He was seen of me also, as of one born
out of due time.” But that was a revelation of Himself from heaven some
considerable time after His ascension.

<span id="vi.vi.xxvi-p79"></span>86. Consequently, let us now take up
the subject which we had postponed, and inquire what mystical meaning
may underlie the report given by Matthew and Mark, namely, that on
rising <span id="page_224">p. 224</span> <span
id="vi.vi.xxvi-Page_224"></span>He made this statement, “I will go
before you into Galilee: there shall ye see me.” For this announcement,
if it was fulfilled at all, was certainly not fulfilled till a
considerable interval had elapsed; whereas it is couched in terms which
seem to lead us (although such a conclusion is not an absolute
necessity) most naturally to expect that the appearance referred to
would be either the only one or the first that would ensue. We observe,
however, that the words in question are not given as the words of the
evangelist himself, in the form of a narrative of a past occurrence, but
as the words of the angel, who spoke according to the Lord’s commission,
and subsequently also as the words of the Lord Himself; that is to say,
the words are used by the evangelist in his narrative, but they are
presented by him as a direct statement of what was spoken by the angel
and by the Lord. This, therefore, unquestionably compels us to accept
them as uttered prophetically. <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md) Now Galilee may be interpreted to
mean either “Transmigration” or “Revelation.” Consequently, if we adopt
the idea of “Transmigration,” what other sense occurs to us to put upon
the sentence, “He goeth before you into Galilee, there shall you see
Him,” but just this, that the grace of Christ was to be transferred from
the people of Israel to the Gentiles? That in preaching the gospel to
these Gentiles, the apostles would meet with no acceptance unless the
Lord prepared a way for them in the hearts of men,—this may be what is
to be understood by the sentence, “He goeth before you into Galilee.”
And, again, that they would look with joy and wonder at the breaking
down and removing of difficulties, and at the opening of a door for them
in the Lord through the enlightenment of the believing,—this is what is
to be understood by the words, “there shall ye see Him;” that is to say,
there shall ye find His members, there shall ye recognise His living
body in the person of those who shall receive you. Or, if we follow the
second view which takes Galilee to signify “Revelation,” the idea may
be, that He was now no more to be in the form of a servant, but in that
form in which He is equal with the Father; <span
id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md) as He promised to those who loved
Him when He said, according to the testimony of John, “And I will love
him, and will manifest myself to him.” <span
id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md) That is to say, He was afterwards
to manifest Himself, not merely as they saw Him before, nor merely in
the way in which, rising as He did with His wounds upon Him, He was to
give Himself to be touched as well as seen by them, but in the character
of that ineffable light, wherewith He enlightens every man that cometh
into this world, and in virtue of which He shineth in darkness, and the
darkness comprehends Him not. <span id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581.md)
Thus has He gone before us to something from which He withdraws not,
although He comes to us, and which does not involve His leaving us,
although He has preceded us thither. That will be a revelation which may
be spoken of as a true Galilee, when we shall be like Him; there shall
we see Him as He is. <span id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582.md) Then,
also, will there be for us the more blessed transmigration, from this
world into that eternity, if we embrace His precepts so as to be counted
worthy of being set apart on His right hand. For there, those on the
left hand shall go away into eternal burning, but the righteous into
life eternal. <span id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583.md) Hence they
shall pass thither, and there, shall they see Him, as the wicked do not
see Him. For the wicked shall be taken away, so that he shall not see
the brightness of the Lord; <span id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584.md)
and the unrighteousness shall not see the light. For He says, “And this
is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom Thou hast sent;” <span id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585.md)
even as He shall be known in that eternity to which He will bring His
servants by the form of a servant, in order that in liberty they may
contemplate the form of the Lord.
