<span id="v.ii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.</span>

<span id="v.ii.xv-p2"></span>40. But it is rather that statement which
the Lord Himself makes in another passage which is wont to disturb the
minds of the little ones, who nevertheless earnestly desire to live now
according to the precepts of Christ: “If any man come to me, and hate
not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and
sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.” <span
id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) For it may seem a contradiction to the
less intelligent, that here He forbids the putting away of a wife saving
for the cause of fornication, but that elsewhere He affirms that no one
can be a disciple of His who does not hate his wife. But if He were
speaking with reference to sexual intercourse, He would not place
father, and mother, and brothers in the same category. But how true it
is, that “the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and they that use
violence take it by force!” <span id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) For
how great violence is necessary, in order that <span id="page_18">p.
18</span> <span id="v.ii.xv-Page_18"></span>a man may love his enemies,
and hate his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers!
For He commands both things who calls us to the kingdom of heaven. And
how these things do not contradict each other, it is easy to show under
His guidance; but after they have been understood, it is difficult to
carry them out, although this too is very easy when He Himself assists
us. For in that eternal kingdom to which He has vouchsafed to call His
disciples, to whom He also gives the name of brothers, there are no
temporal relationships of this sort. For “there is neither Jew nor
Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor
female;” “but Christ is all, and in all.” <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) And the Lord Himself says: “For in the
resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) but are as the angels of God in
heaven.” <span id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) Hence it is necessary
that whoever wishes here and now to aim after the life of that kingdom,
should hate not the persons themselves, but those temporal relationships
by which this life of ours, which is transitory and is comprised in
being born and dying, is upheld; because he who does not hate them, does
not yet love that life where there is no condition of being born and
dying, which unites parties in earthly wedlock.

<span id="v.ii.xv-p8"></span>41. Therefore, if I were to ask any good
Christian who has a wife, and even though he may still be having
children by her, whether he would like to have his wife in that kingdom;
mindful in any case of the promises of God, and of that life where this
incorruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on
immortality; <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) though at present
hesitating from the greatness, or at least from a certain degree of
love, he would reply with execration that he is strongly averse to it.
Were I to ask him again, whether he would like his wife to live with him
there, after the resurrection, when she had undergone that angelic
change which is promised to the saints, he would reply that he desired
this as strongly as he reprobated the other. Thus a good Christian is
found in one and the same woman to love the creature of God, whom he
desires to be transformed and renewed; but to hate the corruptible and
mortal conjugal connection and sexual intercourse: *i.e.* to love in her
what is characteristic of a human being, to hate what belongs to her as
a wife. So also he loves his enemy, not in as far as he is an enemy, but
in as far as he is a man; so that he wishes the same prosperity to come
to him as to himself, viz. that he may reach the kingdom of heaven
rectified and renewed. This is to be understood both of father and
mother and the other ties of blood, that we hate in them what has fallen
to the lot of the human race in being born and dying, but that we love
what can be carried along with us to those realms where no one says, My
Father; but all say to the one God, “Our Father:” and no one says, My
mother; but all say to that other Jerusalem, Our mother: and no one
says, My brother; but each says respecting every other, Our brother. But
in fact there will be a marriage on our part as of one spouse (when we
have been brought together into unity), with Him who hath delivered us
from the pollution of this world by the shedding of His own blood. It is
necessary, therefore, that the disciple of Christ should hate these
things which pass away, in those whom he desires along with himself to
reach those things which shall for ever remain; and that he should the
more hate these things in them, the more he loves themselves.

<span id="v.ii.xv-p10"></span>42. A Christian may therefore live in
concord with his wife, whether with her providing for a fleshly craving,
a thing which the apostle speaks by permission, not by commandment; or
providing for the procreation of children, which may be at present in
some degree praiseworthy; or providing for a brotherly and sisterly
fellowship, without any corporeal connection, having his wife as though
he had her not, as is most excellent and sublime in the marriage of
Christians: yet so that in her he hates the name of temporal
relationship, and loves the hope of everlasting blessedness. For we
hate, without doubt, that respecting which we wish at least, that at
some time hereafter it should not exist; as, for instance, this same
life of ours in the present world, which if we were not to hate as being
temporal, we would not long for the future life, which is not
conditioned by time. For as a substitute for this life the soul is put,
respecting which it is said in that passage, “If a man hate not his own
soul <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) also, he cannot be my
disciple.” For that corruptible meat is necessary for this life, of
which the Lord Himself says, “Is not the soul <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) more than meat?” *i.e.* this life to
which meat is necessary. And when He says that He would lay down His
soul <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) for His sheep, He
undoubtedly means this life, as He is declaring that He is going to die
for us.
