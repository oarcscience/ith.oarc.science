<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Of the Follies Which the
Pagans Have Indulged in Regarding Jupiter and Saturn.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>31. These narratives of yours, say
they, are but fables which have to be interpreted by the wise, or else
they are fit only to be laughed at; but we revere that Jupiter of whom
Maro says that

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p3"></span>“All things are full of Jove,”

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p4"></span>—<span class="c13"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii-p4.1"></span>Virgil’s</span> *Eclogues*, iii. v. 60;

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p5"></span>that is to say, the spirit of
life <span id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576.md) that vivifies all things.
It is not without some reason, therefore, that Varro thought that Jove
was worshipped by the Jews; for the God of the Jews says by His prophet,
“I fill heaven and earth.” <span id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577.md) But
what is meant by that which the same poet names Ether? How do they take
the term? For he speaks thus:

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p8"></span>“Then the omnipotent father Ether, with
fertilizing showers,

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p9"></span>Came down into the bosom of his
fruitful spouse.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p10"></span>—<span class="c13"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii-p10.1"></span>Virgil’s</span> *Georgics*, ii. 325.

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p11"></span>They say, indeed, that this Ether is
not spirit, <span id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578.md) but a lofty body in
which the heaven is stretched above the air. <span
id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579.md) Is liberty conceded to the poet to
speak at one time in the language of the followers of Plato, as if God
was not body, but spirit, and at another time in the language of the
Stoics, as if God was a body? What is it, then, that they worship in
their Capitol? If it is a spirit, or if again it is, in short, the
corporeal heaven itself, then what does that shield of Jupiter there
which they style the Ægis? The origin of that name, indeed, is explained
by the circumstance that a goat <span id="fr_580"></span>[581](#fn_580.md)
nourished Jupiter when he was concealed by his mother. Or is this a
fiction of the poets? But are the capitols of the Romans, then, also the
mere creations of the poets? And what is the meaning of that, cer<span
id="page_90">p. 90</span> <span id="vi.iv.xxiii-Page_90"></span>tainly
not poetical, but unmistakeably farcical, variability of yours, in
seeking your gods according to the ideas of philosophers in books, and
revering them according to the notions of poets in your temples?

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p15"></span>32. But was that Euhemerus also a
poet, who declares both Jupiter himself, and his father Saturn, and
Pluto and Neptune his brothers, to have been men, in terms so
exceedingly plain that their worshippers ought all the more to render
thanks to the poets, because their inventions have not been intended so
much to disparage them as rather to dress them up? Albeit Cicero <span
id="fr_581"></span>[582](#fn_581.md) mentions that this same Euhemerus was
translated into Latin by the poet Ennius. <span
id="fr_582"></span>[583](#fn_582.md) Or was Cicero himself a poet, who, in
counselling the person with whom he debates in his *Tusculan
Disputations*, addresses him as one possessing knowledge of things
secret, in the following terms: “If, indeed, I were to attempt to search
into antiquity, and produce from thence the subjects which the writers
of Greece have given to the world, it would be found that even those
deities who are reckoned gods of the higher orders have gone from us
into heaven. Ask whose sepulchres are pointed out in Greece: call to
mind, since you have been initiated, the things which are delivered in
the mysteries: then, doubtless, you will comprehend how widely extended
this belief is.” <span id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583.md) This author
certainly makes ample acknowledgment of the doctrine that those gods of
theirs were originally men. He does, indeed, benevolently surmise that
they made their way into heaven. But he did not hesitate to say in
public, that even the honour thus given them in general repute <span
id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584.md) was conferred upon them by men, when
he spoke of Romulus in these words: “By good will and repute we have
raised to the immortal gods that Romulus who founded this city.” <span
id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585.md) How should it be such a wonderful
thing, therefore, to suppose that the more ancient men did with respect
to Jupiter and Saturn and the others what the Romans have done with
respect to Romulus, and what, in good truth, they have thought of doing
even in these more recent times also in the case of Cæsar? And to these
same Virgil has addressed the additional flattery of song, saying:

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p21"></span>“Lo, the star of Cæsar, descendant of
Dione, arose.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p22"></span>—Eclogue, ix. ver. 47.

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p23"></span>Let them see to it, then, that the
truth of history do not turn out to exhibit to our view sepulchres
erected for their false gods here upon the earth!and let them take heed
lest the vanity of poetry, instead of fixing, may be but feigning <span
id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586.md) stars for their deities there in
heaven. For, in reality, that one is not the star of Jupiter, neither is
this one the star of Saturn; but the simple fact is, that upon these
stars, which were set from the foundation of the world, the names of
those persons were imposed after their death by men who were minded to
honour them as gods on their departure from this life. And with respect
to these we may, indeed, ask how there should be such ill desert in
chastity, or such good desert in voluptuousness, that Venus should have
a star, and Minerva be denied one among those luminaries which revolve
along with the sun and moon?

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p25"></span>33. But it may be said that Cicero,
the Academic sage, who has been bold enough to make mention of the
sepulchres of their gods, and to commit the statement to writing, is a
more doubtful authority than the poets; although he did not presume to
offer that assertion simply as his own personal opinion, but put it on
record as a statement contained among the traditions of their own sacred
rites. Well, then, can it also be maintained that Varro either gives
expression merely to an invention of his own, as a poet might do, or
puts the matter only dubiously, as might be the case with an
Academician, because he declares that, in the instance of all such gods,
the matters of their worship had their origin either in the life which
they lived, or in the death which they died, among men? Or was that
Egyptian priest, Leon, <span id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587.md) either a
poet or an Academician, who expounded the origin of those gods of theirs
to Alexander of Macedon, in a way somewhat different indeed from the
opinion advanced by the Greeks, but nevertheless so far accordant
therewith as to make out their deities to have been originally men?

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p27"></span>34. But what is all this to us? <span
id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588.md) Let them assert that they worship
Jupiter, and not a dead man; let them maintain that they have dedicated
their Capitol not to a dead man, but to the Spirit that vivifies all
things and fills the world. And as to that shield of his, which was made
of the skin of a she-goat in honour of his nurse, let them put upon it
whatever interpretation they please. What do they say, however, about
Saturn? <span id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589.md) What is it that they
worship <span id="page_91">p. 91</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxiii-Page_91"></span>under the name of Saturn? Is not this
the deity that was the first to come down to us from Olympus (of whom
the poet sings):

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p30"></span>“Then from Olympus’ height came down

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p31"></span>Good Saturn, exiled from his crown

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p32"></span>By Jove, his mightier heir:

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p33"></span>He brought the race to union first

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p34"></span>Erewhile, on mountain-tops dispersed,

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p35"></span>And gave them statutes to obey,

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p36"></span>And willed the land wherein he lay

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p37"></span>Should Latium’s title bear.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p38"></span>—<span class="c13"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii-p38.1"></span>Virgil’s</span> *Æneid*, viii. 320–324,
Conington’s trans.

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p39"></span>Does not his very image, made as it is
with the head covered, present him as one under concealment? <span
id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590.md) Was it not he that made the practice
of agriculture known to the people of Italy, a fact which is expressed
by the reaping-hook? <span id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591.md) No, say
they; for you may see whether the being of whom such things are recorded
was a man, <span id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592.md) and indeed one
particular king: we, however, interpret Saturn to be *universal Time*,
as is signified also by his name in Greek: for he is called
*Chronus*, <span id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593.md) which word, with the
aspiration thus given it, is also the vocable for time: whence, too, in
Latin he gets the name of *Saturn*, as if it meant that he is
*sated* <span id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594.md) with years. But now,
what we are to make of people like these I know not, who, in their very
effort to put a more favourable meaning upon the names and the images of
their gods, make the confession that the very god who is their major
deity, and the father of the rest, is Time. For what else do they thus
betray but, in fact, that all those gods of theirs are only temporal,
seeing that the very parent of them all is made out to be Time?

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p45"></span>35. Accordingly, their more recent
philosophers of the Platonic school, who have flourished in Christian
times, have been ashamed of such fancies, and have endeavoured to
interpret Saturn in another way, affirming that he received the name
<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii-p45.1"></span>Χρόνος</span> <span
id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595.md) in order to signify, as it were, the
fulness of intellect; their explanation being, that in Greek
*fulness* <span id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596.md) is expressed by the
term <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii-p47.1"></span>χόρος</span>, <span
id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597.md) and *intellect* or *mind* by the term
<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxiii-p48.1"></span>νοῦς</span>; <span
id="fr_598"></span>[599](#fn_598.md) which etymology seems to be favoured
also by the Latin name, on the supposition that the first part of the
word (Saturnus) came from the Latin, and the second part from the Greek:
so that he got the title Saturnus as an equivalent to satur, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p49.1"></span> νοῦς</span>. <span
id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599.md) For they saw how absurd it was to have
that Jupiter regarded as a son of Time, whom they either considered, or
wished to have considered, eternal deity. Furthermore, however,
according to this novel interpretation, which it is marvellous that
Cicero and Varro should have suffered to escape their notice, if their
ancient authorities really had it, they call Jupiter the son of Saturn,
thus denoting him, it may be, as the spirit that proceedeth forth from
that supreme mind—the spirit which they choose to look upon as the soul
of this world, so to speak, filling alike all heavenly and all earthly
bodies. Whence comes also that saying of Maro, which I have cited a
little ago, namely, “All things are full of Jove”? Should they not,
then, if they are possessed of the ability, alter the superstitions
indulged in by men, just as they alter their interpretation; and either
erect no images at all, or at least build capitols to Saturn rather than
to Jupiter? For they also maintain that no rational soul can be produced
gifted with wisdom, except by participation in that supreme and
unchangeable wisdom of his; and this affirmation they advance not only
with respect to the soul of a man, but even with respect to that same
soul of the world which they also designate Jove. Now we not only
concede, but even very particularly proclaim, that there is a certain
supreme wisdom of God, by participation in which every soul whatsoever
that is constituted truly wise acquires its wisdom. But whether that
universal corporeal mass, which is called the world, has a kind of soul,
or, so to speak, its own soul, that is to say, a rational life by which
it can govern its own movements, as is the case with every sort of
animal, is a question both vast and obscure. That is an opinion which
ought not to be affirmed, unless its truth is clearly ascertained;
neither ought it to be rejected, unless its falsehood is as clearly
ascertained. And what will it matter to man, even should this question
remain for ever unsolved, since, in any case, no soul becomes wise or
blessed by drawing from any other soul but from that one supreme and
immutable wisdom of God?

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p51"></span>36. The Romans, however, who have
founded a Capitol in honour of Jupiter, but none in honour of Saturn, as
also these other nations whose opinion it has been that Jupiter ought to
be worshipped pre-eminently and above the rest of the gods, have
certainly not agreed in sentiment with the persons referred to; who, in
accordance with that mad view of theirs, would dedicate their loftiest
citadels <span id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600.md) rather to Saturn, if
they had any power in these things, and who most particularly would
annihilate those mathematicians and nativity-spinners <span
id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601.md) by whom this Saturn, whom their
opponents would designate the maker of the wise, has been placed with
the <span id="page_92">p. 92</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxiii-Page_92"></span>character of a deity of evil among the
other stars. But this opinion, nevertheless, has prevailed so mightily
against them in the mind of humanity, that men decline even to name that
god, and call him *Ancient* <span id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602.md)
rather than Saturn; and that in so fearful a spirit of superstition,
that the Carthaginians have now gone very near to change the designation
of their town, and call it the town of the Ancient <span
id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603.md) more frequently than the town of
Saturn. <span id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604.md)

flourished) as to teach that the gods of the old heathen world were
originally men. He is mentioned by Arnobius, *Adversus Gentes*, iv. 29;
