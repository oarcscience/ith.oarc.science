<span id="vi.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Of Some Who are Mad Enough to
Suppose that the Books Were Inscribed with the Names of Peter and
Paul.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.x-p2"></span>15. Nay more, as by divine judgment, some
of those who either believe, or wish to have it believed, that Christ
wrote matter of that description, have even wandered so far into error
as to allege that these same books bore on their front, in the form of
epistolary superscription, a designation addressed to Peter and Paul.
And it is quite possible that either the enemies of the name of Christ,
or certain parties who thought that they might impart to this kind of
execrable arts the weight of authority drawn from so glorious a name,
may have written things of that nature under the name of Christ and the
apostles. But in such most deceitful audacity they have been so utterly
blinded as simply to have made themselves fitting objects for laughter,
even with young people who as yet know Christian literature only in
boyish fashion, and rank merely in the grade of readers.

<span id="vi.iv.x-p3"></span>16. For when they made up their minds to
represent Christ to have written in such strain as that to His
disciples, they bethought themselves of those of His followers who might
best be taken for the persons to whom Christ might most readily be
believed to have written, as the individuals who had kept by Him on the
most familiar terms of friendship. And so Peter and Paul occurred to
them, I believe, just because in many places they chanced to see these
two apostles represented in pictures as both in company with Him. <span
id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) For Rome, in a specially honourable
and solemn manner, <span id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) commends the
merits of Peter and of Paul, for this reason among others, namely, that
they suffered \[martyrdom\] on the same day. Thus to fall most
completely into error was the due desert of men who sought for Christ
and His apostles not in the holy writings, but on painted walls. Neither
<span id="page_84">p. 84</span> <span id="vi.iv.x-Page_84"></span>is it
to be wondered at, that these fiction-limners were misled by the
painters. <span id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md) For throughout the
whole period during which Christ lived in our mortal flesh in fellowship
with His disciples, Paul had never become His disciple. Only after His
passion, after His resurrection, after His ascension, after the mission
of the Holy Spirit from heaven, after many Jews had been converted and
had shown marvellous faith, after the stoning of Stephen the deacon and
martyr, and when Paul still bore the name Saul, and was grievously
persecuting those who had become believers in Christ, did Christ call
that man \[by a voice\] from heaven, and made him His disciple and
apostle. <span id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md) How, then, is it
possible that Christ could have written those books which they wish to
have it believed that He did write before His death, and which were
addressed to Peter and Paul, as those among His disciples who had been
most intimate with Him, seeing that up to that date Paul had not yet
become a disciple of His at all?
