id="vi.v.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Of the Feast at Which It Was
Objected at Once that Christ Ate with Sinners, and that His Disciples
Did Not Fast; Of the Circumstance that the Evangelists Seem to Give
Different Accounts of the Parties by Whom These Objections Were Alleged;
And of the Question Whether</span> <span id="page_132">p. 132</span>
<span id="vi.v.xxviii-Page_132"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxviii-p1.2"></span>Matthew and Mark and Luke are Also in
Harmony with Each Other in the Reports Given of the Words of These
Persons, and of the Replies Returned by the Lord.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxviii-p2"></span>60. Matthew, accordingly, goes on to
say: “And it came to pass, as He sat at meat in the house, behold, many
publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and His disciples;”
and so on, down to where we read, “But they put new wine into new
bottles, and both are preserved.” <span
id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md) Here Matthew has not told us
particularly in whose house it was that Jesus was sitting at meat along
with the publicans and sinners. This might make it appear as if he had
not appended this notice in its strict order here, but had introduced at
this point, in the way of reminiscence, something which actually took
place on a different occasion, were it not that Mark and Luke, who
repeat the account in terms thoroughly similar, have made it plain that
it was in the house of Levi—that is to say, Matthew—that Jesus sat at
meat, and all these sayings were uttered which follow. For Mark states
the same fact, keeping also the same order, in the following manner:
“And it came to pass, as He sat at meat in his house, many publicans and
sinners sat also together with Jesus.” <span
id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925.md) Accordingly, when he says, “in his
house,” he certainly refers to the person of whom he was speaking
directly before, and that was Levi. To the same effect, after the words,
“He saith unto him, Follow me; and he left all, rose up, and followed
Him,” <span id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926.md) Luke has appended
immediately this statement: “And Levi made Him a great feast in his own
house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat
down with them.” And thus it is manifest in whose house it was that
these things took place.

<span id="vi.v.xxviii-p6"></span>61. Let us next look into the words
which these three evangelists have all brought in as having been
addressed to the Lord, and also into the replies which were made by Him.
Matthew says: “And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto His
disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?” <span
id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927.md) This reappears very nearly in the same
words in Mark: “How is it that He eateth and drinketh with publicans and
sinners?” <span id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928.md) Only we find thus that
Matthew has omitted one thing which Mark inserts—namely, the addition
“and drinketh.” But of what consequence can that be, since the sense is
fully given, the idea suggested being that they were partaking of a
repast in company? Luke, on the other hand, seems to have recorded this
scene somewhat differently. For his version proceeds thus: “But their
scribes and Pharisees murmured against His disciples, saying, Why do ye
eat and drink with publicans and sinners?” <span
id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929.md) But his intention in this certainly is
not <span id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930.md) to indicate that their
Master was not referred to on that occasion, but to intimate that the
objection was levelled against all of them together, both Himself and
His disciples; the charge, however, which was to be taken to be meant
both of Him and of them, being addressed directly not to Him, but to
them. For the fact is that Luke himself, no less than the others,
represents the Lord as making the reply, and saying, “I came not to call
the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” <span
id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931.md) And He would not have returned that
answer to them, had not their words, “Why do ye eat and drink?” been
directed very specially to Himself. For the same reason, Matthew and
Mark have told us that the objection which was brought against Him was
stated immediately to His disciples, because, when the allegation was
addressed to the disciples, the charge was thereby laid all the more
seriously against the Master whom these disciples were imitating and
following. One and the same sense, therefore, is conveyed; and it is
expressed all the better in consequence of these variations employed in
some of the terms, while the matter of fact itself is left intact. In
like manner we may deal with the accounts of the Lord’s reply. Matthew’s
runs thus: “They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are
sick; but go ye and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”  <span
id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932.md) Mark and Luke have also preserved for
us the same sense in almost the same words, with this exception, that
they both fail to introduce that quotation from the prophet, “I will
have mercy, and not sacrifice.” Luke, again, after the words, “I came
not to call the righteous, but sinners,” has added the term, “unto
repentance.” This addition serves to bring out the sense more fully, so
as to preclude any one from supposing that sinners are loved by Christ,
purely for the very reason that they are sinners. For this similitude
also of the *sick* indicates clearly what God means by the calling of
sinners,—that it is like the physician with the sick,—and that its
object verily is that men should be saved from their iniquity as from
disease; which healing is effected by repentance.

<span id="vi.v.xxviii-p13"></span>62. In the same way, we may subject
what is said about the disciples of John to examination. Matthew’s words
are these: “Then came to <span id="page_133">p. 133</span> <span
id="vi.v.xxviii-Page_133"></span>Him the disciples of John, saying, Why
do we and the Pharisees fast oft?” <span
id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933.md) The purport of Mark’s version is
similar: “And the disciples of John and the Pharisees <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934.md) used to fast. <span
id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935.md) And they come and say unto Him, Why do
the disciples of John and the Pharisees <span
id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936.md) fast, but thy disciples fast
not?” <span id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937.md) The only semblance of a
discrepancy that can be found here, is in the possibility of supposing
that the mention of the Pharisees as having spoken along with the
disciples of John is an addition of Mark’s, while Matthew states only
that the disciples of John expressed themselves to the above effect. But
the words which were actually uttered by the parties, according to
Mark’s version, rather indicate that the speakers and the persons spoken
of were not the same individuals. I mean, that the persons who came to
Jesus were the guests who were then present, that they came because the
disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting, and that they uttered
the above words with respect to these parties. In this way, the
evangelist’s phrase, “they come,” would not refer to the persons
regarding whom he had just thrown in the remark, “And the disciples of
John and the Pharisees were fasting.” But the case would be, that as
those parties were fasting, some others here, who are moved by that
fact, come to Him, and put this question to Him, “Why do the disciples
of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?” This is
more clearly expressed by Luke. For, evidently with the same idea in his
mind, after stating what answer the Lord returned in the words in which
He spoke about the calling of sinners under the similitude of those who
are sick, he proceeds thus: “And they said unto Him, Why do the
disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the
disciples of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink?” <span
id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938.md) Here, then, we see that, as was the
case with Mark, Luke has mentioned one party as speaking to this intent
in relation to other parties. How comes it, therefore, that Matthew
says, “Then came to Him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the
Pharisees fast?” The explanation may be, that those individuals were
also present, and that all these various parties were eager to advance
this charge, as they severally found opportunity. And the sentiments
which sought expression on this occasion have been conveyed by the three
evangelists under varied terms, but yet without any divergence from a
true statement of the fact itself.

<span id="vi.v.xxviii-p20"></span>63. Once more, we find that Matthew
and Mark have given similar accounts of what was said about the children
of the bridegroom not fasting as long as the bridegroom is with them,
with this exception, that Mark has named them the children of the
bridals, <span id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939.md) while Matthew has
designated them the children of the bridegroom. <span
id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940.md) That, however, is a matter of no
moment. For by the children of the bridals we understand at once those
connected with the bridegroom, and those connected with the bride. The
sense, therefore, is obvious and identical, and neither different nor
contradictory. Luke, again, does not say, “Can the children of the
bridegroom fast?” but, “Can ye make the children of the bridegroom fast,
while the bridegroom is with them?” By expressing it in this method, the
evangelist has elegantly opened up the self-same sense in a way
calculated to suggest something else. For thus the idea is conveyed,
that those very persons who were speaking would try to make the children
of the bridegroom mourn and fast, inasmuch as they would \[seek to\] put
the bridegroom to death. Moreover, Matthew’s phrase, “mourn,” is of the
same import as that used by Mark and Luke, namely, “fast.” For Matthew
also says further on, “Then shall they fast,” and not, “Then shall they
mourn.” But by the use of this phrase, he has indicated that the Lord
spoke of that kind of fasting which pertains to the lowliness of
tribulation. In the same way, too, the Lord may be understood to have
pictured out a different kind of fasting, which stands related to the
rapture of a mind dwelling in the heights of things spiritual, and for
that reason estranged in a certain measure from the meats that are for
the body, when He made use of those subsequent similitudes touching the
new cloth and the new wine, by which He showed that this kind of fasting
is an incongruity for sensual <span id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941.md)
and carnal people, who are taken up with the cares of the body, and who
consequently still remain in the old mind. These similitudes are also
embodied in similar terms by the other two evangelists. And it should be
sufficiently evident that there need be no real discrepancy, although
one may introduce something, whether belonging to the subject-matter
itself, or merely to the terms in which that subject is expressed, which
another leaves out; provided only that there be neither any departure
from a genuine identity in sense, nor any contradiction created between
the different forms which may be adopted for expressing the same thing.
