<span id="vi.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.—A Statement of the Reason Why the
Enumeration of the Ancestors of Christ is Carried Down to Joseph, While
Christ Was Not Born of that Man’s Seed, But of the Virgin Mary.</span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p2"></span>2. The evangelist Matthew has commenced his
narrative in these terms: “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ,
the son of David, the son of Abraham.” <span
id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659) By this exordium he shows with
sufficient clearness that his undertaking is to give an account of the
generation of Christ according to the flesh. For, according to this,
Christ is the Son of man,—a title which He also gives very frequently to
Himself, <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660) thereby commending to
our notice what in His compassion He has condescended to be on our
behalf. For that heavenly and eternal generation, in virtue of which He
is the only-begotten Son of God, before every creature, because all
things were made by Him, is so ineffable, that it is of it that the word
of the prophet must be understood when he says, “Who shall declare His
generation?” <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661) Matthew therefore
traces out the human generation of Christ, mentioning His ancestors from
Abraham downwards, and carrying them on to Joseph the husband of Mary,
of whom Jesus was born. For it was not held allowable to consider him
dissociated from the married estate which was entered into with Mary, on
the ground that she gave birth to Christ, not as the wedded wife of
Joseph, but as a virgin. For by this example an illustrious
recommendation is made to faithful married persons of the principle,
that even when by common consent they maintain their continence, the
relation can still remain, and can still be called one of wedlock,
inasmuch as, although there is no connection between the sexes of the
body, there is the keeping of the affections of the mind; particularly
so for this reason, that in their case we see how the birth of a son was
a possibility apart from anything of that carnal intercourse which is to
be practised with the purpose of the procreation of children only.
Moreover, the mere fact that he had not begotten Him by act of his own,
was no sufficient reason why Joseph should not be called the father of
Christ; for indeed he could be in all propriety the father of one whom
he had not <span id="page_103">p. 103</span> <span
id="vi.v.ii-Page_103"></span>begotten by his own wife, but had adopted
from some other person.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p6"></span>3. Christ, it is true, was also supposed to
be the son of Joseph in another way, as if He had been born simply of
that man’s seed. But this supposition was entertained by persons whose
notice the virginity of Mary escaped. For Luke says: “And Jesus Himself
began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son
of Joseph.” <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662) This Luke, however,
instead of naming Mary His only parent, had not the slightest hesitation
in also speaking of both parties as His parents, when he says: “And the
boy grew and waxed strong, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was
in Him: and His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the
passover.” <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663) But lest any one may
fancy that by the “parents” here are rather to be understood the blood
relations of Mary along with the mother herself, what shall be said to
that preceding word of the same Luke, namely, “And His father <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664) and mother marvelled at those things
which were spoken of Him”? <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665)
Since, then, he also makes the statement that Christ was born, not in
consequence of Joseph’s connection with the mother, but simply of Mary
the virgin, how can he call him His father, unless it be that we are to
understand him to have been truly the husband of Mary, without the
intercourse of the flesh indeed, but in virtue of the real union of
marriage; and thus also to have been in a much closer relation the
father of Christ, in so far as He was born of his wife, than would have
been the case had He been only adopted from some other party? And this
makes it clear that the clause,“as was supposed,” <span
id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666) is inserted with a view to those who
are of opinion that He was begotten by Joseph in the same way as other
men are begotten.
