<span id="vii.xi-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.xi-p1.1"></span>Sermon IX.</span>

<span id="vii.xi-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.xi-p2.1"></span>\[LIX. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.xi-p3"></span>*Again, on the Lord’s Prayer,* [Matt.
6.5-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005)<span id="vii.xi-p3.1"></span>*.
To the Competentes.*

<span id="vii.xi-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xi-p4.1"></span>You</span> have rehearsed what you believe, hear
now what you are to pray for. Forasmuch as you would not be able to call
on Him, in whom you should not first have believed; as saith the
Apostle, “How shall they call on Him, in whom they have not
believed?” <span id="fr_2082"></span>[2083](#fn_2082) Therefore have you
first learned the Creed, where is a brief and sublime rule of your
faith; brief in the number of its words, sublime in the weight of its
contents. <span id="fr_2083"></span>[2084](#fn_2083) But the prayer
which you receive to-day to be learned by heart, and to be repeated
eight days hence, was dictated (as you heard when the Gospel was being
read) by the Lord Himself to His disciples, and came from them unto us,
since “their sound went into all the earth.” <span
id="fr_2084"></span>[2085](#fn_2084)

<span id="vii.xi-p8"></span>2. Ye then who have found a Father in
heaven, be loth to cleave to the things of earth. For ye are about to
say, “Our Father, which art in heaven.” <span
id="fr_2085"></span>[2086](#fn_2085) You have begun to belong to a great
family. Under this Father the lord and the slave are brethren; under
this Father the general and the common soldier are brethren; under this
Father the rich man and the poor are brethren. All Christian believers
have divers fathers in earth, some noble, some obscure; but they all
call upon one Father which is in heaven. If our Father be there, there
is the inheritance prepared for us. But He is such a Father, that we can
possess with Him what He giveth. For He giveth an inheritance; but He
doth not leave it to us by dying. For He doth not depart Himself, but He
abideth ever, that we may come to Him. Seeing then we have heard of Whom
we are to ask, let us <span id="page_289">p. 289</span> <span
id="vii.xi-Page_289"></span>know also what to ask for, lest haply we
offend such a Father by asking amiss.

<span id="vii.xi-p10"></span>3. What then hath the Lord Jesus Christ
taught us to ask of the Father which is in heaven? “Hallowed be Thy
Name.” <span id="fr_2086"></span>[2087](#fn_2086) What kind of blessing
is this that we ask of God, that His Name may be hallowed? The Name of
God is always Holy; why then do we pray that it may be hallowed, except
that we may be hallowed by it? We pray then that that which is Holy
always, may be hallowed in us. The Name of God is hallowed in you when
ye are baptized. Why will ye offer this prayer after ye have been
baptized, but that that which ye shall then receive may abide ever in
you?

<span id="vii.xi-p12"></span>4. Another petition follows, “Thy kingdom
come.” <span id="fr_2087"></span>[2088](#fn_2087) God’s kingdom will
come, whether we ask it or not. Why then do we ask it, but that that
which will come to all saints may also come to us; that God may count us
also in the number of His saints, to whom His kingdom is to come?

<span id="vii.xi-p14"></span>5. We say in the third petition, “Thy will
be done as in heaven, so in earth.” <span
id="fr_2088"></span>[2089](#fn_2088) What is this? That as the Angels
serve Thee in heaven, so we may serve Thee in earth. For His holy Angels
obey Him; they do not offend Him; they do His commands through the love
of Him. This we pray for then, that we too may do the commands of God in
love. Again, these words are understood in another way, “Thy will be
done as in heaven, so in earth.” Heaven in us is the soul, earth in us
is the body. What then is, “Thy will be done as in heaven, so in earth”?
As we hear Thy precepts, so may our flesh consent unto us; lest, whilst
flesh and spirit strive together, we be not able to fulfil the commands
of God.

<span id="vii.xi-p16"></span>6. “Give us this day our daily
bread,” <span id="fr_2089"></span>[2090](#fn_2089) comes next in the
Prayer. Whether we ask here of the Father support <span
id="fr_2090"></span>[2091](#fn_2090) necessary for the body, by “bread”
signifying whatever is needful for us; or whether we understand that
daily Bread, which ye are soon to receive from the Altar; well it is
that we pray that He would give it us. For what is it we pray for, but
that we may commit no evil, for which we should be separated from that
holy Bread. And the word of God which is preached daily is daily bread.
For because it is not bread for the body, it is not on that account not
bread for the soul. But when this life shall have passed away, we shall
neither seek that bread which hunger seeks; nor shall we have to receive
the Sacrament of the Altar, because we shall be there with Christ, whose
Body we do now receive; nor will those words which we are now speaking,
need to be said to you, nor the sacred volume to be read, when we shall
see Him who is Himself the Word of God, by whom all things were made, by
whom the Angels are fed, by whom the Angels are enlightened, by whom the
Angels become wise; not requiring words of circuitous discourse; but
drinking in the Only Word, filled with whom they burst forth <span
id="fr_2091"></span>[2092](#fn_2091) and never fail in praise. For,
“Blessed,” saith the Psalm, “are they who dwell in Thy house; they will
be always praising Thee.” <span id="fr_2092"></span>[2093](#fn_2092)

<span id="vii.xi-p21"></span>7. Therefore in this present life, do we
ask what comes next, “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our
debtors.” <span id="fr_2093"></span>[2094](#fn_2093) In Baptism, all
debts, that is, all sins, are entirely forgiven us. But because no one
can live without sin here below, and if without any great crime which
entails separation from the Altar, yet altogether without sins can no
one live on this earth, and we can only receive the one Baptism once for
all; in this Prayer we hear how we may day by day be washed, that our
sins may day by day be forgiven us; but only if we do what follows, “As
we also forgive our debtors.” Accordingly, my Brethren, I advise you,
who are in the grace of God my sons, yet my Brethren under that heavenly
Father; I advise you, whenever any one offends and sins against you, and
comes, and confesses, and asks your pardon, that ye do pardon him, and
forthwith from the heart forgive him; lest ye keep off from your own
selves that pardon, which comes from God. For if ye forgive not, neither
will He forgive you. Therefore it is in this life that we make this
petition, for that it is in this life that sins can be forgiven, where
they can be done. But in the life to come they are not forgiven, because
they are not done.

<span id="vii.xi-p23"></span>8. Next after this we pray, saying, “Lead
us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” <span
id="fr_2094"></span>[2095](#fn_2094) This also, that we be not led into
temptation, it is necessary for us to ask in this life, because in this
life there are temptations; and that “we may be delivered from evil,”
because there is evil here. And thus of all these seven petitions, three
have respect to the life eternal, and four to the present life.
“Hallowed be Thy name.” This will be for ever. “Thy kingdom come.” This
kingdom will be for ever. “Thy will be done as in heaven, so in earth.”
This will be for ever. “Give us this day our daily bread.” This will not
be for ever. “Forgive us our debts.” This will not be for ever. “Lead us
not into temptation.” This will not be for ever. “But deliver us from
evil.” This will not be for ever: but where there is temptation, and
where there is evil, there is it necessary that we make this petition.
