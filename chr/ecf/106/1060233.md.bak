<span id="vii.xvi-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Sermon XIV.</span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.xvi-p2.1"></span>\[LXIV. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xvi-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. x.
16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p3.2"></span>,
“Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves,” etc.
Delivered on a Festival of Martyrs.*

<span id="vii.xvi-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xvi-p4.1"></span>When</span> the Holy Gospel was read, Brethren,
ye heard how our Lord Jesus Christ strengthened His Martyrs by His
teaching, saying, “Behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of
wolves.” <span id="fr_2214"></span>[2215](#fn_2214.md) Now consider, my
Brethren, what he does. If but one wolf come among many sheep, be they
ever so many thousands, they will all be put to confusion by one wolf in
the midst of them: and though all may not be torn, yet all are
frightened. What manner of design is this then, what manner of counsel,
what manner of power, not to let in a wolf amongst the sheep, but to
send the sheep against the wolves! “I send you,” saith He, “as sheep in
the midst of wolves;” not to the neighbourhood of wolves, but “in the
midst of wolves.” There was then at that time a herd of wolves, and but
few sheep. For when the many wolves killed the few sheep, the wolves
were changed and became sheep.

<span id="vii.xvi-p6"></span>2. Let us hear then what advice He hath
given, who hath promised the crown, but hath first appointed the combat;
who is a spectator of the combatants, and assisteth them in their toil.
What manner of conflict hath He prescribed? “Be ye,” saith He, “wise as
serpents, and simple as doves.” <span
id="fr_2215"></span>[2216](#fn_2215.md) Whoso understandeth, and holdeth to
this, may die in assurance <span id="fr_2216"></span>[2217](#fn_2216.md)
that he will not really die. For no one ought to die in this assurance,
but he who knows that he shall in such sort die, as that death only
shall die in him, and life be crowned.

<span id="vii.xvi-p9"></span>3. Wherefore, Beloved, I must explain to
you, though I have often spoken already on this subject, what it is to
be “simple as doves, and wise as serpents.” Now if the simplicity of
doves be enjoined us, what hath the wisdom of the serpent to do in the
simplicity of the dove? This in the dove I love, that she has no gall;
this I fear in the serpent, that he has poison. But now do not fear the
serpent altogether; something he has for thee to hate, and something for
thee to imitate. For when the serpent is weighed down with age, and he
feels the burden of his many years, he contracts and forces himself into
a hole, and lays aside his old coat <span
id="fr_2217"></span>[2218](#fn_2217.md) of skin, that he may spring forth
into new life. Imitate him in this, thou Christian, who dost hear Christ
saying, “Enter ye in at the strait gate.” <span
id="fr_2218"></span>[2219](#fn_2218.md) And the Apostle Paul saith to thee,
“Put ye off the old man with his deeds, and put ye on the new
man.” <span id="fr_2219"></span>[2220](#fn_2219.md) Thou hast then
something to imitate in the serpent. Die not for the “old man,” but for
the truth. Whoso dies for any temporal good dies “for the old man.” But
when thou hast stripped thyself of <span id="page_306">p. 306</span>
<span id="vii.xvi-Page_306"></span>all “that old man,” thou hast
imitated the wisdom of the serpent. Imitate him in this again; “keep thy
head safe.” And what does this mean, keep thy head safe? Keep Christ
with thee. Have not some of you, it may be, observed, on occasions when
you have wished to kill an adder, how to save his head, he will expose
his whole body to the strokes of his assailant? He would not that that
part of him should be struck, where he knows that his life resides. And
our Life is Christ, for He hath said Himself, “I am the way, and the
truth, and the life.” <span id="fr_2220"></span>[2221](#fn_2220.md) Here
the Apostle also; “The Head of the man is Christ.” <span
id="fr_2221"></span>[2222](#fn_2221.md) Whoso then keepeth Christ in him,
keepeth his head for his protection.

<span id="vii.xvi-p15"></span>4. Now what need is there to commend to
you in many words the simplicity of the dove? For the serpent’s poison
had need to be guarded against: there, there was a danger in imitation;
there, there was something to be feared; but the dove may you imitate
securely. Mark how the doves rejoice in society; everywhere do they fly
and feed together; they do not love to be alone, they delight in
communion, they preserve affection; their cooings are the plaintive
cries  <span id="fr_2222"></span>[2223](#fn_2222.md) of love, with kissings
they beget their young. Yea even when doves, as we have often noticed,
dispute about their holes, it is as it were but a peaceful strife. Do
they separate, because of their contentions? Nay, still do they fly and
feed together, and their very strife is peaceful. See this strife of
doves, in what the Apostle saith, “If any man obey not our word by this
epistle, mark that man, and have no company with him.” Behold the
strife; but observe now how it is the strife of doves, not of wolves. He
subjoined immediately, “Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him
as a brother.” <span id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223.md) The dove loves
even when she is in strife; and the wolf even when he caresses, hates.
Therefore having the simplicity of doves, and the wisdom of serpents,
celebrate the solemnities of the Martyrs in sobriety of mind, <span
id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224.md) not <span
id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225.md) in bodily excess, sing lauds to
God. For He who is the Martyrs’ God, is our Lord God also, He it is who
will crown us. If we shall have wrestled well, we shall be crowned by
Him, who hath crowned already those whom we desire to imitate.

<span id="vii.xvi-p18"></span> See, as to the excesses which prevailed
at the festivals of the Martyrs, a letter of St. Augustin to Aurelius
Bishop of Carthage and Primate of Africa (Ep. 22<span
id="vii.xvi-p18.1"></span>, al. 64), urging him to use his authority to
suppress them. St Ambrose had prohibited these feasts in the Church of
Milan (Augustin, *Conf*. lib. 6. 2 \[Am. edition i. 90, note\]).
Aurelius succeeded in getting a canon (xxx.) made in the third Council
of Carthage (<span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xvi-p18.2"></span>A.D.</span> 397), obliging the clergy to
abstain from all such feasts in the Church, and as far as in them lay to
restrain the people from the same practice (*Conc. Labbe*, t. 2, p.
1171; Bingham, B. xx. vii. § 10).
