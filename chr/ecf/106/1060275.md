“Now do ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and the platter,”
etc.*

<span id="vii.lviii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.lviii-p4.1"></span>Ye</span> have heard the holy Gospel, how the
Lord Jesus in that which He said to the Pharisees, conveyed doubtless a
lesson to His own disciples, that they should not think that
righteousness consists in the cleansing of the body. For every day did
the Pharisees wash themselves in water before they dined; as if a daily
washing could be a cleansing of the heart. Then He showed what sort of
persons they were. He told them who saw them; for He saw not their faces
only but their inward parts. For that ye may know this, that Pharisee,
to whom Christ made answer, thought within himself, he uttered nothing
aloud, yet the Lord heard him. For within himself he blamed the Lord
Christ, because He had so come to his feast without having washed. He
was thinking, the Lord heard, therefore He answered. What then did He
answer? “Now do ye Pharisees wash the outside of the platter; but within
ye are full of guile and ravening.”  <span
id="fr_3381"></span>[3382](#fn_3381) What! is this to come to a feast!
how did He not spare the man by whom He had been invited? Yea rather by
rebuking He did spare him, that being reformed He might spare him in the
judgment. And what is it that He showeth to us? That Baptism also which
is conferred once for all, cleanses by faith. Now faith is within, not
without. Wherefore it is said and read in the Acts of the Apostles,
“Cleansing their hearts by faith.” <span
id="fr_3382"></span>[3383](#fn_3382) And the Apostle Peter thus speaks
in his Epistle; “So too hath He given you a similitude from Noah’s ark,
how that eight souls were saved by water.” And then he added, “So also
in a like figure will baptism save us, not the putting away of the filth
of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience.” <span
id="fr_3383"></span>[3384](#fn_3383) “This answer of a good conscience”
did the Pharisees despise, and washed “that which was without;” within
they continued full of pollution.

<span id="vii.lviii-p8"></span>2. And what did He say to them after
this? “But rather give alms, and behold all things are clean unto
you.” <span id="fr_3384"></span>[3385](#fn_3384) See the praise of alms,
do, and prove it. But mark awhile; this was said to the Pharisees. These
Pharisees were Jews, the choice men as it were of the Jews. For those of
most consideration and learning were then called Pharisees. They had not
been washed by Christ’s Baptism; they had not yet believed on Christ,
the Only-begotten Son of God, who walked among them, yet was not
acknowledged by them. How then doth He say to them, “Give alms, and
behold all things are clean unto you”? If the Pharisees had paid heed to
Him, and given alms, at once according to His word “all things would
have been clean to them;” what need then was there for them to believe
on Him? But if they could not be cleansed, except by believing on Him,
who “cleanseth the heart by faith;” what means, “Give alms, and behold
all things are clean unto you”? Let us carefully consider this, and
peradventure He Himself explains it.

<span id="vii.lviii-p10"></span>3. When He had spoken thus, doubtless
they thought that they did give alms. And how did they give them? They
tithed all they had, they took away a tenth of all their produce, and
gave it. It is no easy matter to find a Christian who doth as much. See
what the Jews did. Not wheat only, but wine, and oil; nor this only, but
even the most trifling things, cummin, rue, mint, and anise, <span
id="fr_3385"></span>[3386](#fn_3385) in obedience to God’s precept, they
tithed all; put aside, that is, a tenth part, and gave alms of it. I
suppose then that they recalled this to mind, and thought that the Lord
Christ was speaking to no purpose, as if to those who did not give alms;
whereas they knew their own doings, how that they tithed, and gave alms
of the minutest and most trifling of their produce. They mocked Him
within themselves as He spake thus, as if to men who did not give alms.
The Lord knowing this, immediately subjoined, <span id="page_436">p.
436</span> <span id="vii.lviii-Page_436"></span>“But woe unto you,
Scribes and Pharisees, who tithe mint, and cummin, and rue, and all
herbs.” <span id="fr_3386"></span>[3387](#fn_3386) That ye may know, I
am aware of your alms. Doubtless these tithes are your alms; yea even
the minutest and most trifling of your fruits do ye tithe; “Yet ye leave
the weightier matters of the law, judgment and charity.” Mark. Ye have
“left judgment and charity,” and ye tithe herbs. This is not to do alms.
“These,” saith He, “ought ye to do, and not to leave the other undone.”
Do what? “Judgment and charity, justice and mercy;” and “not to leave
the other undone.” Do these; but give the preference to the others.

<span id="vii.lviii-p13"></span>4. If this be so, why did He say to
them, “Do alms, and behold all things are clean unto you”? What is, “Do
alms”? Do mercy. What is, “Do mercy”? If thou understand, begin with
thine own self. For how shouldest thou be merciful to another, if thou
art cruel to thyself? “Give alms, and all things are clean unto you.” Do
true alms. What is alms? Mercy. Hear the Scripture; “Have mercy on thine
own soul, pleasing God.” <span id="fr_3387"></span>[3388](#fn_3387) Do
alms, “Have mercy on thine own soul, pleasing God.” Thine own soul is a
beggar before thee, return to thy conscience. Whosoever thou art, who
art living in wickedness or unbelief, return to thy conscience; and
there thou findest thy soul in beggary, thou findest it needy, thou
findest it poor, thou findest it in sorrow, nay perhaps thou dost not
find it in need, but dumb through its neediness. For if it beg, it
“hungereth after righteousness.” Now when thou findest thy soul in such
a state (all this is within, in thy heart), first do alms, give it
bread. What bread? If the Pharisee had asked this question, the Lord
would have said to him, “Give alms to thine own soul.” For this He did
say to him; but he did not understand it, when He enumerated to them the
alms which they were used to do, and which they thought were unknown to
Christ; and He saith to them, “I know that ye do this, ‘ye tithe mint
and anise, cummin and rue;’ but I am speaking of other alms; ye despise
‘judgment and charity.’ In judgment and charity give alms to thine own
soul.” What is “in judgment”? Look back, and discover thyself; mislike
thyself, pronounce a judgment against thyself. And what is charity?
“Love the Lord God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with
all thy mind; love thy neighbour as thyself:” <span
id="fr_3388"></span>[3389](#fn_3388) and thou hast done alms first to
thine own soul, within thy conscience. Whereas if thou neglect this
alms, give what thou wilt, give how much thou wilt; reserve of thy goods
not a tenth, but a half; give nine parts, and leave but one for thine
own self: thou doest nothing, when thou doest not alms to thine own
soul, and art poor in thyself. Let thy soul have its food, that it
perish not by famine. Give her bread. What bread, thou wilt say? He
speaketh with thee Himself. If thou wouldest hear, and understand, and
believe the Lord, He would say to thee Himself, “I am the Living Bread
which came down from heaven. <span id="fr_3389"></span>[3390](#fn_3389)
Wouldest thou not first give this Bread to thine own soul, and do alms
unto it? If then thou believest, thou oughtest so to do, that thou
mayest first feed thine own soul. Believe in Christ, and the things
which are within shall be cleansed; and what is without shall be clean
also. “Let us turn to the Lord,” etc.
