<span id="vii.xv-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.xv-p1.1"></span>Sermon XIII.</span>

<span id="vii.xv-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.xv-p2.1"></span>\[LXIII. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.xv-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xv-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. viii.
23](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#023.md)<span id="vii.xv-p3.2"></span>, “And
when he was entered into a boat,” etc.*

<span id="vii.xv-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xv-p4.1"></span>By</span> the Lord’s blessing, I will address
you upon the lesson of the Holy Gospel which has just been read, and
take occasion thereby to exhort you, that against the tempest and waves
of this world, faith sleep not in your hearts. “For the Lord Christ had
not indeed death nor sleep in His power, and peradventure sleep overcame
the Almighty One as He was sailing against His will?” If ye believe
this, He is asleep in you; but if Christ be awake in you, your faith is
awake. The Apostle saith, “that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
faith.” <span id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206.md) This sleep then of
Christ is a sign of a high mystery. <span
id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207.md) The sailors are the souls passing
over the world in wood. That ship also was a figure of the Church. And
all, individually indeed are temples of God, and his own heart is the
vessel in which each sails; nor can he suffer shipwreck, if his thoughts
are only good.

<span id="vii.xv-p7"></span>2. Thou hast heard an insult, it is the
wind; thou art angry, it is a wave. When therefore the wind blows, and
the wave swells, the ship is endangered, the heart is in jeopardy, the
heart is tossed to and fro. When thou hast heard an insult, thou longest
to be avenged; and, lo, avenged thou hast been, and so rejoicing in
another’s harm thou hast suffered shipwreck. And why is this? Because
Christ is asleep in <span id="page_305">p. 305</span> <span
id="vii.xv-Page_305"></span>thee. What does this mean, Christ is asleep
in thee? Thou hast forgotten Christ. Rouse Him up then, call Christ to
mind, let Christ awake in thee, give heed to Him. What didst thou wish?
To be avenged. Hast thou forgotten, that when He was being crucified, He
said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do?” <span
id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208.md) He who was asleep in thy heart did
not wish to be avenged. Awake Him up then, call Him to remembrance. The
remembrance of Him is His word; the remembrance of Him is His command.
And then wilt thou say if Christ, awake in thee, What manner of man am
I, who wish to be avenged! Who am I, who deal out threatenings against
another man? I may die perhaps before I am avenged. And when at my last
breath, inflamed with rage, and thirsting for vengeance, I shall depart
out of this body, He will not receive me, who did not wish to be
avenged; He will not receive me, who said, “Give, and it shall be given
unto you; forgive, and it shall be forgiven you.” <span
id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209.md) Therefore will I refrain myself
from my wrath, and return to the repose of my heart. Christ hath
commanded the sea, tranquillity is restored.

<span id="vii.xv-p10"></span>3. Now what I have said as to anger, hold
fast as a rule in all your temptations. A temptation has sprung up; it
is the wind; thou art disturbed; it is a wave. Awake up Christ then, let
Him speak with thee. “Who is this, since the winds and the sea obey
Him?” <span id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210.md) Who is this, whom the
sea obeyeth? “The sea is His, and He made it.” <span
id="fr_2211"></span>[2212](#fn_2211.md) “All things were made by
Him.” <span id="fr_2212"></span>[2213](#fn_2212.md) Imitate the winds then,
and the sea rather; obey the Creator. At Christ’s command the sea giveth
ear; and art thou deaf? The sea heareth, and the wind ceaseth: and dost
thou still blow on? What! I say, I do, I devise; what is all this, but
to be blowing on, and to be unwilling to stop in obedience to the word
of Christ? Let not the wave master you in this troubled state of your
heart. Yet since we are but men, if the wind should drive us on, and
stir up the affections of our souls, let us not despair; let us awake
Christ, that we may sail on a tranquil sea, and so come to our country.
“Let us <span id="fr_2213"></span>[2214](#fn_2213.md) turn to the Lord,”
etc.
