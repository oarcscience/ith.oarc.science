<span id="vi.v.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—Of Another Question Which
Demands Our Consideration, Namely, Whether, in Passing from the Account
of the Man Whose Withered Hand Was Restored, These Three Evangelists
Proceed to Their Next Subjects in Such a Way as to Create No
Contradictions in Regard to the Order of Their Narrations.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxxvii-p2"></span>83. Matthew continues his narrative,
connecting it in the following manner with what precedes: “But the
Pharisees went out and held a council against Him, how they might
destroy Him. But when Jesus knew it, He withdrew Himself from thence:
and great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them all; and charged
them that they should not make Him known: that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the prophet Esaias, saying;” and so forth, down to
where it is said, “And in His name shall the Gentiles trust.” <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[1007](#fn_1006) He is the only one that records
these facts. The other two have advanced to other themes. Mark, it is
true, seems to some extent to have kept by the historical order: for he
tells us how Jesus, on discovering the malignant disposition which was
entertained toward Him by the Jews, withdrew to the sea along with His
disciples, and that then vast multitudes flocked to Him, and He healed
great numbers of them. <span id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007) But,
at the same time, it is not quite clear at what precise point He begins
to pass to a new subject, different from what would have followed in
strict succession. He leaves it uncertain whether such a transition is
made at the point where he tells us how the multitudes gathered about
Him (for if that was the case now, it might equally well have been the
case at some other time), or at the point where He says that “He goeth
up into a mountain.” It is this latter circumstance that Luke also
appears to notice when he says, “And it came to pass in those days, that
He went out into a mountain to pray.” <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[1009](#fn_1008) For by the expression “in those
days,” he makes it plain enough that the incident referred to did not
occur in immediate succession upon what precedes. <span
