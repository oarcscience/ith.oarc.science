id="vi.vii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Of the Circumstance that Mark
Has Recorded More Than Luke as Spoken by the Lord in Connection with the
Case of This Man Who Was Casting Out Devils in the Name of Christ,
Although He Was Not Following with the Disciples; And of the Question
How These Additional Words Can Be Shown to Have a Real Bearing
Upon</span> <span id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span

id="vi.vii.vii-p1.2"></span>What Christ Had in View in Forbidding the
Individual to Be Interdicted Who Was Performing Miracles in His
Name.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.vii-p2"></span>7. Mark proceeds with his narrative in
these terms: “For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my
name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not
lose his reward. And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones
that believe on me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged
about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. And if thy hand offend
thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than
having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be
quenched; where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.” And
so on, down to where it is said, “Have salt in yourselves, and have
peace one with another.” <span id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md)
These words Mark represents to have been spoken by the Lord in the
connection immediately following what He said in forbidding the man to
be interdicted who was casting out devils in His name, and yet was not
following Him along with the disciples. In this section, too, he
introduces some matters which are not found in any of the other
evangelists, but also some which occur in Matthew as well, and some
which we come across in like manner both in Matthew and in Luke. Those
other evangelists, however, bring in these matters in different
connections, and in another order of facts, and not at this particular
point when the statement was made to Christ about the man who did not
follow Him along with the disciples, and yet was casting out devils in
His name. My opinion, therefore, is, that the Lord did really utter
sayings in this connection, according to Mark’s attestation, of which he
also delivered Himself on other occasions, and this for the simple
reason, that they were sufficiently pertinent to this expression of His
mind which he gave here, when He forbade the placing of any interdict
upon the working of miracles in His name, even although that should be
done by a man who did not follow Him along with His disciples. For Mark
presents the relation of the one passage to the other thus: “For he that
is not against us is on our part; for whosoever shall give you a cup of
water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say
unto you, he shall not lose his reward.” This makes it plain that even
this man, whose case John had taken up, and thus had given occasion for
the Lord to commence the discourse referred to, was not separating
himself from the society of the disciples to any such effect as to scorn
it like a heretic. But his position was something parallel to the
familiar one of men who, while not going the length yet of receiving the
sacraments of Christ, nevertheless favour the Christian name so far as
even to receive Christians, and accommodate themselves to them for this
very reason, and none other, that they are Christian; of which type of
persons it is that He tells us that they do not lose their reward. This
does not mean, however, that they ought at once to think themselves
quite safe and secure simply on account of this kindness which they
cherish towards Christians, while at the same time they are neither
cleansed by Christ’s baptism, nor incorporated into the unity of His
body. But the import is, that they are now being guided by the mercy of
God in such a way that they may also come to these higher things, <span
id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) and so quit this present world in
safety. And such persons assuredly are more profitable \[servants\],
even before they become associated with the number of Christians, than
those individuals who, while already bearing the Christian name and
partaking in the Christian sacraments, recommend courses which are only
fitted to drag others, whom they may persuade to adopt them, along with
themselves into eternal punishment. These are the persons to whom He
refers under the figure of the members of the body, and whom He commands
to be cast out from the body, like an offending hand or eye; that is to
say, to be cut off from the fellowship of that unity, in order that they
should seek rather to enter into life without such associates, than to
go into hell in their company. Moreover, they are separated from those
from whom they separate themselves, just when no consent is yielded to
their evil recommendations, that is to say, to the offences in which
they indulge. And if, indeed, they are discovered in the character of
their perversity to all good men with whom they have any
fellowship, <span id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md) they are cut off
completely from the fellowship of all, and also from participation in
the divine sacraments. But if they are known in this character only to
some, while their perversity is unknown to the majority, they must just
be borne with, as the chaff is endured in the thrashing-floor previous
to the winnowing; that is to say, they must be dealt with in a manner
which will neither involve any agreement with them in the fellowship of
unrighteousness, nor lead to a forsaking of the society of the good on
their account. This is what is done by those who have salt in
themselves, and who have peace one with another.
