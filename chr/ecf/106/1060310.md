<span id="vii.xciii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xciii-p3.1"></span>*[John xiv.
6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006)<span id="vii.xciii-p3.2"></span>, “I
am the way, and the truth, and the life.”*

<span id="vii.xciii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xciii-p4.1"></span>Amongst</span> other things, when the Holy
Gospel was being read, ye heard what the Lord Jesus said, “I am the Way,
and the Truth, and the Life.” <span id="fr_4187"></span>[4188](#fn_4187)
Truth and life doth every man desire; but not every man doth find the
way. That God is a certain Life Eternal, Unchangeable, Intelligible,
Intelligent, Wise, Making wise, some philosophers even of this world
have seen. The fixed, settled, unwavering truth, wherein are all the
principles <span id="fr_4188"></span>[4189](#fn_4188) of all things
created, they saw indeed, but afar off; they saw, but amid the error in
which they were placed; and therefore what way to attain to that so
great, and ineffable, and beatific a possession they formed not. For
that even they saw (as far as can be seen by man) the Creator by means
of the creature, the Worker by His work, the Framer of the world by the
world, the Apostle Paul is witness, whom Christians ought surely to
believe. For he said when he was speaking of such; “The wrath of God is
revealed from heaven against all ungodliness.” <span
id="fr_4189"></span>[4190](#fn_4189) These are, as ye recognise, the
words of the Apostle Paul; “The wrath of God is revealed from heaven
against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men; who detain the
truth in unrighteousness.” Did he say that they do not detain truth? No:
but, “They detained the truth in unrighteousness.” What they detain, is
good; but wherein they detain it, is bad. “They detain the truth in
unrighteousness.”

<span id="vii.xciii-p8"></span>2. Now it occurred to him that it might
be said to him, “Whence do these ungodly men detain the truth? Hath God
spoken to any one of them? Have they received the Law as the people of
the Israelites by Moses? Whence then do they detain the truth, though it
be even in this unrighteousness?” Hear what follows, and he shows.
“Because that which can be known of God,” he says, “is manifest in them;
for God hath manifested it unto them.”  <span
id="fr_4190"></span>[4191](#fn_4190) Manifested it unto them to whom He
hath not given the Law? Hear how He hath manifested it. “For the
invisible things of Him are clearly seen, being understood by the things
that are made.” <span id="fr_4191"></span>[4192](#fn_4191) Ask the
world, the beauty of the heaven, the brilliancy and ordering of the
stars, the sun, that sufficeth for the day, the moon, the solace of the
night; ask the earth fruitful in herbs, and trees, full of animals,
adorned with men; ask the sea, with how great and what kind of fishes
filled; ask the air, with how great birds stocked; <span
id="fr_4192"></span>[4193](#fn_4192) ask all things, and see if they do
not as if it were by a language <span
id="fr_4193"></span>[4194](#fn_4193) of their own make answer to thee,
“God made us.” These things have illustrious philosophers sought out,
and by the art have come to know the Artificer. What then? Why is the
wrath of God revealed against this ungodliness? “Because they detain the
truth in unrighteousness?” Let him come, let him show how. For how they
came to know Him, he hath said already. “The invisible things of Him,”
that is God, “are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
made; His eternal Power also and Godhead; so that they are without
excuse. Because that when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God,
neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their
foolish heart was darkened.” <span id="fr_4194"></span>[4195](#fn_4194)
They are the Apostle’s words, not mine: “And their foolish heart was
darkened; for professing themselves to be wise, they became
fools.” <span id="fr_4195"></span>[4196](#fn_4195) What by curious
search they found, by pride they lost. “Professing themselves to be
wise,” attributing, that is, the gift of God to themselves, “they became
fools.” They are the Apostle’s words, I say; “Professing themselves to
be wise, they became fools.”

<span id="vii.xciii-p15"></span>3. Show, prove their foolishness. Show,
O Apostle, and as thou hast shown us whereby they were able to attain to
the knowledge of God, for that “the invisible things of Him are clearly
seen, being understood by those things that are made;” so now show how,
“professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.” Hear; Because
“they changed,” he says, “the glory of the incorruptible God into the
likeness of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and of
four-footed beasts, and of creeping things.” <span
id="fr_4196"></span>[4197](#fn_4196) For of figures of these animals,
the Pagans made themselves gods. Thou hast found out God, and thou
worshippest an idol. Thou hast found out the truth, and this very truth
dost thou detain in unrighteousness. And what by the works of God thou
hast come to know, by the works of man thou losest. Thou hast considered
the universe, <span id="fr_4197"></span>[4198](#fn_4197) hast collected
the order of the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all the elements; thou
wilt not take heed to this, that the world is the work of God, an idol
is the work of a carpenter. If the carpenter as he has given the figure,
could also give a heart, the carpenter would be worshipped by his own
idol. For, O man, as God is thy Framer, so the idol’s framer is a man.
Who is thy God? He That made thee. Who is the carpenter’s god? He That
made him. <span id="page_532">p. 532</span> <span
id="vii.xciii-Page_532"></span>Who is the idol’s god? He that made it.
If then the idol had a heart, would he not worship the carpenter who
made it? See in what unrighteousness they detained the truth, and found
not the way that leadeth to that possession which they saw.

<span id="vii.xciii-p18"></span>4. But Christ, for that He is with the
Father, the Truth, and Life, the Word of God, of whom it is said, “The
Life was the Light of men;” <span id="fr_4198"></span>[4199](#fn_4198)
for that I say He is with the Father, the Truth, and Life, and we had no
way whereby to go to the Truth, the Son of God, who is ever in the
Father the Truth and Life, by assuming man’s nature became the Way. Walk
by Him as Man, and thou comest to God. By Him thou goest, to Him thou
goest. Look not out for any way whereby to come to Him, besides Himself.
For if He had not vouchsafed to be the Way, we should have always gone
astray. He then became the Way Whereby thou shouldest come; I do not say
to thee, seek the Way. The Way Itself hath come to thee, arise and walk.
Walk, with the life, <span id="fr_4199"></span>[4200](#fn_4199) not with
the feet. For many walk well with the feet, and with their lives walk
ill. For sometimes even those who walk well, run outside the way. Thus
you will find men living well, and not Christians. They run well; but
they run not in the way. The more they run, the more they go astray;
because they are out of the Way. But if such men as these come to the
Way, and hold on the Way, O how great is their security, because they
both walk well, and do not go astray! But if they do not hold on the
Way, however well they walk, alas! how are they to be bewailed! For
better is it to halt in the way, than to walk on stoutly outside the
way. Let this suffice for you, Beloved. Turn we to the Lord, etc.
