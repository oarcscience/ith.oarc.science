<span id="v.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p2"></span>44. Rightly, therefore, does he who is
intent on cleansing our heart follow up <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) what He has said with a precept, where
He says: “Lay not up <span id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md) for
yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust <span
id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) doth corrupt, <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) and where thieves break through and
steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth
nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be <span
id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) also.” If, therefore, the heart be on
earth, *i.e.* if one perform anything with a heart bent on obtaining
earthly advantage, how will that heart be clean which wallows on earth?
But if it be in heaven, it will be clean, because whatever things are
heavenly are clean. For anything becomes polluted when it is mixed with
a nature that is inferior, although not polluted of its kind; for gold
is polluted even by pure silver, if it be mixed with it: so also our
mind becomes polluted by the desire after earthly things, although the
earth itself be pure of its kind and order. But we would not understand
heaven in this passage as anything corporeal, because everything
corporeal is to be reckoned as earth. For he who lays up treasure for
himself in heaven ought to despise the whole world. Hence it is in that
heaven of which it is said, “The heaven of heavens is the Lord’s, <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) *i.e.* in the spiritual firmament: for
it is not in that which is to pass away that we ought to fix and place
our treasure and our heart, but in that which ever abideth; but heaven
and earth shall pass away. <span id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md)

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p10"></span>45. And here He makes it manifest that
He gives all these precepts with a view to the cleansing of the heart,
when He says: “The candle <span id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) of the
body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall
be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full
of darkness. If, therefore, the light \[lamp\] <span
id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md) that is in thee be darkness, how great
is that darkness!” And this passage we are to understand in such a way
as to learn from it that all our works are pure and well-pleasing in the
sight of God, when they are done with a single heart, *i.e.* with a
heavenly intent, having that end of love in view; for love is also the
fulfilling of the law. <span id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) Hence we
ought to take the eye here in the sense of the intent itself, wherewith
we do whatever we are doing; and if this be pure and right, and looking
at that which ought to be looked at, all our works which we perform in
accordance therewith are necessarily good. And all those works He has
called the whole body; for the apostle also speaks of certain works of
which he disapproves as our members, and teaches that they are to be
mortified, saying, “Mortify therefore your members which are upon the
earth; fornication, uncleanness, covetousness,” <span
id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md) and all other such things. <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md)

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p16"></span>46. It is not, therefore, what one
does, but the intent with which he does it, that is to be considered.
For this is the light in us, because it is a thing manifest to ourselves
that we do with a good intent what we are doing; for everything which is
made manifest is light. <span id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371.md) For the
deeds themselves which go forth from us to human society, have an
uncertain issue; and therefore He has called them darkness. For I do not
know, when I present money to a poor man who asks it, either what he is
to do with it, or what he is to suffer from it; and it may happen that
he does some evil with it, or suffers some <span id="page_49">p.
49</span> <span id="v.iii.xiii-Page_49"></span>evil on account of it, a
thing I did not wish to happen when I gave it to him, nor would I have
given it with such an intention. If, therefore, I did it with a good
intention,—a thing which was known to me when I was doing it, and is
therefore called light,—my deed also is lighted up, whatever issue it
shall have; but that issue, inasmuch as it is uncertain and unknown, is
called darkness. But if I have done it with a bad intent, the light
itself even is darkness. For it is spoken of as light, because every one
knows with what intent he acts, even when he acts with a bad intent; but
the light itself is darkness, because the aim is not directed singly to
things above, but is turned downwards to things beneath, and makes, as
it were, a shadow by means of a double heart. “If, therefore, the light
that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!” *i.e.*, if the
very intent of the heart with which you do what you are doing (which is
known to you) is polluted by the hunger after earthly and temporal
things, and blinded, how much more is the deed itself, whose issue is
uncertain, polluted and full of darkness! Because, although what you do
with an intent which is neither upright nor pure, may turn out for some
one’s good, it is the way in which you have done it, not how it has
turned out for him, that is reckoned to you. <span

Robert South gives his sermon on this passage the heading, “No man ever
went to heaven whose heart was not there before.” It has been remarked,
as regards an earthly Church, one does not take abiding interest in it
unless one gives toward it.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p18"></span> The eye is as the *lamp* (Revised
Version) through which the body gets light,—the organ whose proper work
it is to transmit light. The blind have no light, because their lamp is
out or destroyed. The light within us is “the reason, especially the
practical reason” (Meyer); that which is left of the divine image in man
(Tholuck); the reason that was left after the fall of Adam (Calvin); the
Old-Testament revelation perverted (Lange); the conscience (Alford).
“The spirit of man is the candle (*lamp*, Revised Version) of the Lord”
([Prov. xx. 27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p18.1"></span>): it guides the faculties of the soul. But
if it be in darkness how great is that darkness; *i.e.* the darkness
which already existed! What a terrible condition those are in who do not
receive the Spirit of enlightenment (who becomes the “inner light”), and
feel no need of Him! “He whose affections are on heavenly things, has
his whole soul lighted; he whose affections are depraved, has his
understanding and his whole soul darkened also” (Mansel).
