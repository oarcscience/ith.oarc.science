id="vi.v.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—An Explanation of the Statement
Made by Matthew, to the Effect that Joseph Was Afraid to Go with the
Infant Christ into Jerusalem on Account of Archelaus, and Yet Was Not
Afraid to Go into Galilee, Where Herod, that Prince’s Brother, Was
Tetrarch.</span>

<span id="vi.v.ix-p2"></span>21. Here again, however, it may happen that
a difficulty will be found, and that some, seeing that Matthew has told
us how Joseph was afraid to go into Judæa with the child on his return,
expressly for the reason that Archelaus the son reigned there in place
of his father Herod, may be led to ask how he could have gone into
Galilee, where, as Luke bears witness, there was another son of that
Herod, namely, Herod the tetrarch. But such a difficulty can only be
founded on the fancy that the times indicated as those in which there
was such apprehension on the child’s account were identical with the
times dealt with now by Luke: whereas it is conspicuously evident that
there is a change in the periods, because we no longer find Archelaus
represented as king in Judæa; but in place of him we have Pontius
Pilate, who also was not the king of the Jews, but only their governor,
in whose times the sons of the elder Herod, acting under Tiberius Cæsar,
held not the kingdom, but the tetrarchy. And all this certainly had not
come to pass at the time when Joseph, in fear of the Archelaus who was
then reigning in Judæa, betook himself, together with the child, into
Galilee, where was also his city Nazareth.
