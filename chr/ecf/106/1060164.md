<span id="vi.v.lxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXVII.—Of the Expulsion of the
Sellers and Buyers from the Temple, and of the Question as to the
Harmony Between the First Three Evangelists and John, Who Relates the
Same Incident in a Widely Different Connection.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxviii-p2"></span>129. Matthew goes on with his narrative
in the following terms: “And when He was come into Jerusalem, all the
city was moved, saying, Who is this? And the multitude said, This is
Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. And Jesus went into the
temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the
temple;” and so on, down to where we read, “But ye have made it a den of
thieves.” This account of the multitude of sellers who were cast out of
the temple is given by all the evangelists; but John introduces it in a
remarkably different order. <span id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137)
For, after recording the testimony borne by John the Baptist to Jesus,
and mentioning that He went into Galilee at the time when He turned the
water into wine, and after he has also noticed the sojourn of a few days
in Capharnaum, John proceeds to tell us that He went up to Jerusalem at
the season of the Jews’ passover, and when He had made a scourge of
small cords, drove out of the temple those who were selling in it. This
makes it evident that this act was performed by the Lord not on a single
occasion, but twice over; but that only the first instance is put on
record by John, and the last by the other three.
