<span id="vi.v.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—Of the Consistency of the
Accounts Given by Matthew and Luke Regarding the Dumb and Blind Man Who
Was Possessed with a Devil.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxxviii-p2"></span>84. Matthew then goes on with his
recital in the following fashion: “Then was brought unto Him one
possessed with a devil, blind and dumb; and He healed him, insomuch that
he both spake and saw.” <span id="fr_1010"></span>[1011](#fn_1010.md) Luke
introduces this narrative, not in the same order, but after a number of
other matters. He also speaks of the man only as dumb, and not as blind
in addition. <span id="fr_1011"></span>[1012](#fn_1011.md) But it is not to
be inferred, from the mere circumstance of his silence as to some
portion or other of the account, that he speaks of an entirely different
person. For he has likewise recorded what followed \[immediately after
that cure\], as it stands also in Matthew.
