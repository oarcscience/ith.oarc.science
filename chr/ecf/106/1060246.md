<span id="vii.xxix-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span

<span id="vii.xxix-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xxix-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. xv.
21](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021.md)<span
id="vii.xxix-p3.2"></span>,“Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the
parts of Tyre and Sidon. And behold, a Canaanitish woman,” etc.*

<span id="vii.xxix-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xxix-p4.1"></span>This</span> woman of Canaan, who has just now
been brought before us in the lesson of the Gospel, shows us an example
of humility, and the way of godliness; shows us how to rise from
humility unto exaltation. Now she was, as it appears, not of the people
of Israel, of whom came the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and the parents of
the Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh; of whom the Virgin Mary
herself was, who was the Mother of Christ. This woman then was not of
this people; but of the Gentiles. For, as we have heard, the Lord
“departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, and behold, a woman of
Canaan came out of the same coasts,” <span
id="fr_2592"></span>[2593](#fn_2592.md) and with the greatest earnestness
begged of Him the mercy to heal her daughter, “who was grievously vexed
with a devil.” Tyre and Sidon were not cities of the people of Israel,
but of the Gentiles; though they bordered on that people. So then, as
being eager to obtain mercy she cried out, and boldly knocked; and He
made as though He heard her not, <span
id="fr_2593"></span>[2594](#fn_2593.md) not to the end that mercy might be
refused her, but that her desire might be enkindled; and not only that
her desire might be enkindled, but that, as I have said before, her
humility might be set forth. Therefore did she cry, while the Lord was
as though He heard her not, but was ordering in silence what He was
about to do. The disciples besought the Lord for her, and said, “Send
her away; for she crieth after us.” And He said, “I am not sent, but
unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” <span
id="fr_2594"></span>[2595](#fn_2594.md)

<span id="vii.xxix-p8"></span>2. Here arises a question out of these
words; “If He was not sent but unto the lost sheep <span
id="page_343">p. 343</span> <span id="vii.xxix-Page_343"></span>of the
house of Israel, how came we from among the Gentiles into Christ’s fold?
What is the meaning of the so deep economy <span
id="fr_2595"></span>[2596](#fn_2595.md) of this mystery, that whereas the
Lord knew the purpose of His coming—that He might have a Church in all
nations, He said that ‘He was not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the
house of Israel’?” We understand then by this that it behoved Him to
manifest His Bodily presence, His Birth, the exhibition of His miracles,
and the power of His Resurrection, among that people: that so it had
been ordained, so set forth from the beginning, so predicted, and so
fulfilled; that Christ Jesus was to come to the nation of the Jews, to
be seen and slain, and to gain from among them those whom He foreknew.
For that people was not wholly condemned, but sifted. There was among
them a great quantity of chaff, but there was also the hidden
worth <span id="fr_2596"></span>[2597](#fn_2596.md) of the grain; there was
among them that which was to be burnt, there was among them also that
wherewith the barn was to be filled. For whence came the Apostles?
whence came Peter? whence the rest?

<span id="vii.xxix-p11"></span>3. Whence was Paul himself, who was first
called Saul? That is, first proud, afterwards humble? For when he was
Saul, his name was derived from Saul: now Saul was a proud king; and in
his reign he persecuted the humble David. <span
id="fr_2597"></span>[2598](#fn_2597.md) So when he who was afterwards
Paul, <span id="fr_2598"></span>[2599](#fn_2598.md) was Saul, he was proud,
at that time a persecutor of the innocent, at that time a waster of the
Church. For he had received letters from the chief priests (burning as
he was with zeal for the synagogue, and persecuting the Christian name),
that he might show up whatever Christians he should find, to be
punished. <span id="fr_2599"></span>[2600](#fn_2599.md) While he is on his
way, while he is breathing out slaughter, while he is thirsting for
blood, he is thrown to the ground by the voice of Christ from heaven the
persecutor, he is raised up the preacher. In him was fulfilled that
which is written in the Prophet, “I will wound and I will heal.” <span
id="fr_2600"></span>[2601](#fn_2600.md) For that only in man doth God
wound, which lifteth itself up against God. He is no unkind <span
id="fr_2601"></span>[2602](#fn_2601.md) physician who opens the swelling,
who cuts, or cauterizes the corrupted part. He gives pain, it is true;
but he only gives pain, that he may bring the patient on to health. He
gives pain; but if he did not, he would do no good. Christ then by one
word laid Saul low, and raised up Paul; that is, He laid low the proud,
and raised up the humble. For what was the reason of his change of name,
that whereas he was afore called Saul, he chose afterwards to be called
Paul; but that he acknowledged in himself that the name of Saul when he
was a persecutor, had been a name of pride? He chose therefore a humble
name; to be called Paul, that is, the least. For Paul is, “the least.”
Paul is nothing else but little. And now glorying in this name, and
giving us a lesson <span id="fr_2602"></span>[2603](#fn_2602.md) of
humility, he says, “I am the least of the Apostles.” <span
id="fr_2603"></span>[2604](#fn_2603.md) Whence then, whence was he, but of
the people of the Jews? Of them were the other Apostles, of them was
Paul, of them were they whom the same Paul mentions, as having seen the
Lord after His resurrection. For he says, “That He was seen of above
five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this
present, but some are fallen asleep.” <span
id="fr_2604"></span>[2605](#fn_2604.md)

<span id="vii.xxix-p20"></span>4. Of this people too, of the people of
the Jews, were they, who when Peter was speaking, setting forth the
Passion, and Resurrection, and Divinity of Christ (after that the Holy
Ghost had been received, when all they on whom the Holy Ghost had come,
spake with the tongues of all nations), being pricked in spirit as they
heard him, sought counsel for their salvation, understanding as they did
that they were guilty of the Blood of Christ; because they had
crucified, and slain Him, in whose name though slain by them they saw
such great miracles wrought; and saw the presence of the Holy Ghost. And
so seeking counsel they received for answer; “Repent, and be baptized
every one of you, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and your sins
shall be forgiven you.” <span id="fr_2605"></span>[2606](#fn_2605.md) Who
should despair of the forgiveness of his sins, when the crime of killing
Christ was forgiven to those who were guilty of it? They were converted
from among this people of the Jews; were converted, and baptized. They
came to the Lord’s table, and in faith drank that Blood, which in their
fury they had shed. Now in what sort they were converted, how
decidedly, <span id="fr_2606"></span>[2607](#fn_2606.md) and how perfectly,
the Acts of the Apostles show. “For they sold all that they possessed,
and laid the prices of their things at the Apostles’ feet; and
distribution was made unto every man according as he had need; and no
man said that ought was his own, but they had all things common.” <span
id="fr_2607"></span>[2608](#fn_2607.md) And, “They were,” as it is written,
“of one heart and of one soul.” Lo here are the sheep of whom He said,
“I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” For to
them He exhibited His Presence, for them in the midst of their violence
against Him He prayed as He was being crucified, “Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do.” <span
id="fr_2608"></span>[2609](#fn_2608.md) The Physician understood how those
frenzied men were in their madness putting the Physician to death, and
in putting their Physician to death, though they knew it not, were
preparing a medicine for themselves. For by the Lord so put to death are
all <span id="page_344">p. 344</span> <span
id="vii.xxix-Page_344"></span>we cured, by His Blood redeemed, by the
Bread of His Body delivered from famine. This Presence then did Christ
exhibit to the Jews. And so He said, “I am not sent, but unto the lost
sheep of the house of Israel;” that to them He might exhibit the
Presence of His body; not that He might disregard, and pass over the
sheep which He had among the Gentiles.

<span id="vii.xxix-p25"></span>5. For to the Gentiles He went not
Himself, but sent His disciples. And in this was fulfilled what the
Prophet said; “A people whom I have not known hath served Me.” See how
deep, how clear, how express the prophecy is; “a people whom I have not
known,” that is, to whom I have not exhibited My Presence, “hath served
Me.” How? It goes on to say, “By the hearing of the ear they have obeyed
Me:” <span id="fr_2609"></span>[2610](#fn_2609.md) that is, they have
believed, not by seeing, but by hearing. Therefore have the Gentiles the
greater praise. For the others saw and slew Him; the Gentiles heard and
believed. Now it was to call and gather together the Gentiles, that that
might be fulfilled which we have just now chanted, “Gather us from among
the Gentiles, that we may confess to Thy Name, and glory in Thy
praise,” <span id="fr_2610"></span>[2611](#fn_2610.md) that the Apostle
Paul was sent. He, the least, made great, not by himself, but by Him
whom he once persecuted, was sent to the Gentiles, <span
id="fr_2611"></span>[2612](#fn_2611.md) from a robber become a shepherd,
from a wolf a sheep. He, the least Apostle, was sent to the Gentiles,
and laboured much among the Gentiles, and through him the Gentiles
believed. His Epistles are the witnesses.

<span id="vii.xxix-p29"></span>6. Of this you have a very sacred figure
in the Gospel also. A daughter of a ruler of the synagogue was really
dead, and her father besought the Lord, that He would go to her; he had
left her sick, and in extreme danger. <span
id="fr_2612"></span>[2613](#fn_2612.md) The Lord set out to visit and heal
the sick; in the mean time it was announced that she was dead, and it
was told the father; “Thy daughter is dead, trouble not the Master.” But
the Lord who knew that He could raise the dead, did not deprive the
despairing father of hope, and said to him, “Fear not: only believe.” So
he set out to the maiden; and in the way a certain woman, who had
suffered from an issue of blood, and in her lengthened illness had spent
to no purpose all that she had upon physicians, pressed herself in, how
she could, amongst the crowds. When she touched the border of His
garment, she was made whole. And the Lord said, “Who touched Me?” The
disciples who knew not what had taken place, and saw that He was
thronged by the multitudes, and that He was troubling Himself about one
single woman who had touched Him gently, answered in astonishment, “The
multitudes press Thee, and sayest Thou, Who touched Me? And He said,
Somebody hath touched Me? for the other press, she hath touched. The
many <span id="fr_2613"></span>[2614](#fn_2613.md) then rudely <span
id="fr_2614"></span>[2615](#fn_2614.md) press the Body of Christ, few touch
it healthfully. “Somebody,” saith He, “hath touched Me, for I perceive
that virtue is gone out of Me. And when the woman saw that she was not
hid, she fell down at His feet,” and confessed what had taken place.
After this He set out again, and arrived whither He was going, and
raised to life the young daughter of the ruler of the synagogue who was
found to be dead.

<span id="vii.xxix-p33"></span>7. This was a literal fact, and was
fulfilled as it is related; but nevertheless these very things which
were done by the Lord had some further signification, being (if we may
so say) a sort of visible and significative words. And this is
especially plain, in that place where He sought fruit on the tree out of
season, and because He found none, dried up the tree by His curse. <span
id="fr_2615"></span>[2616](#fn_2615.md) Unless this action be regarded as a
figure, there is no good meaning in it; first to have sought fruit on
that tree when it was not the season for fruit on any tree; and then
even if it were now the time of fruit, what fault in the tree was it to
have none? But because it signified, that He seeketh not for leaves
only, but for fruit also, that is, not for the words only, but for the
deeds of men, by drying up that tree whereon he found only leaves, he
signified their punishment who can speak good things, but will not do
them. And so it is in this place also. For surely there is a mystery in
it. He who foreknoweth all things saith, “Who touched Me?” The Creator
maketh Himself like one who is ignorant; and He asketh, who not only
knew this, but who even foreknew all other things. Doubtless there is
something which Christ would speak to us in this significant mystery.

<span id="vii.xxix-p35"></span>8. That daughter of the ruler of the
synagogue was a figure of the people of the Jews, for whose sake Christ
had come, who said, “I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house
of Israel.” But the woman who suffered from the issue of blood, figured
the Church from among the Gentiles, to which Christ was not sent in His
bodily presence. He was going to the former, He was intent on her
recovery; meanwhile the latter runs to meet Him, touches His border as
though He knew it not; that is, she is healed by Him who is in some
sense absent. He saith, “Who touched Me?” as though He would say; I do
not know this people; “A people whom I have not known hath served Me.
Some one hath touched Me. For I perceive that virtue is gone out of Me;”
that is, that My Gospel hath gone out and filled the whole world. Now it
is the border that is touched, a small and outside <span
id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616.md) part of the gar<span
id="page_345">p. 345</span> <span id="vii.xxix-Page_345"></span>ment.
Consider the Apostles as it were the garment of Christ. Among them Paul
was the border; that is, the last and least. For he said of himself that
he was both; “I am the least of the Apostles.” <span
id="fr_2617"></span>[2618](#fn_2617.md) For he was called after them all,
he believed after them all, he healed more than they all. The Lord was
not sent but “unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” But because a
“people whom He had not known, was also to serve Him, and to obey Him in
the hearing of the ear,” He made mention of them too when He was among
the others. For the same Lord said in a certain place, “Other sheep I
have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, that there may
be one fold and one shepherd.” <span
id="fr_2618"></span>[2619](#fn_2618.md)

<span id="vii.xxix-p39"></span>9. Of these was this woman; therefore she
was not refused, but only put off. “I am not sent,” saith He, “but unto
the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” And she was instant in her
cries: she persevered, she knocked, as if she had already heard, “Ask,
and receive; seek, and thou shalt find; knock, and it shall be opened
unto thee.” She kept on, she knocked. For so the Lord when He spake
these words, “Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall find; knock,
and it shall be opened unto you;” <span
id="fr_2619"></span>[2620](#fn_2619.md) had also said before, “Give not
that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before
swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend
you;” <span id="fr_2620"></span>[2621](#fn_2620.md) that is, lest after
despising your pearls, they should even ill use you. <span
id="fr_2621"></span>[2622](#fn_2621.md) Cast not therefore before them what
they despise.

<span id="vii.xxix-p43"></span>10. And how distinguish we (as might be
answered) who are “swine,” and who are “dogs”? This has been shown in
the case of this woman. For He only answered to her entreaties, “It is
not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.” <span
id="fr_2622"></span>[2623](#fn_2622.md) Thou art a dog, thou art one of the
Gentiles, thou worshippest idols. But for dogs what is so proper <span
id="fr_2623"></span>[2624](#fn_2623.md) as to lick stones? “It is not”
therefore “meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.”
Had she retired after these words, she had gone away as she had come, a
dog; but by knocking she was made of a dog one of human kind. <span
id="fr_2624"></span>[2625](#fn_2624.md) For she persevered in asking, and
from that reproach as it were she manifested her humility, and obtained
mercy. For she was not excited, nor incensed, because she was called a
dog, as she asked the blessing, and prayed for mercy, but she said,
“Truth, Lord;” <span id="fr_2625"></span>[2626](#fn_2625.md) “Thou hast
called me a dog, and truly a dog I am, I acknowledge my name: it is the
Truth that speaks: but I ought not on that account to be refused this
blessing. Verily I am a dog; ‘yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall
from their masters’ table.’ It is but a moderate and a small blessing I
desire; I do not press to the table, I only seek for the crumbs.”

<span id="vii.xxix-p48"></span>11. See, Brethren, how the value of
humility is set before us! The Lord had called her a dog; and she did
not say, “I am not,” but she said, “I am.” And because she acknowledged
herself to be a dog, immediately the Lord said, “Woman, great is thy
faith; be it unto thee even as thou hast asked.” <span
id="fr_2626"></span>[2627](#fn_2626.md) Thou hast acknowledged thyself to
be a dog, I now acknowledge thee to be of human kind. “O woman, great is
thy faith;” thou hast asked, and sought, and knocked; receive, find, be
it opened unto thee. See, Brethren, how in this woman who was a
Canaanite, that is, who came from among the Gentiles, and was a type,
that is a figure, of the Church, the grace of humility has been
eminently set before us. For the Jewish nation, to the end that it might
be deprived of the grace of the Gospel, was puffed up with pride,
because to them it had been vouchsafed <span
id="fr_2627"></span>[2628](#fn_2627.md) to receive the Law, because out of
this nation the Patriarchs had proceeded, the Prophets had sprung,
Moses, the servant of God, had done the great miracles in Egypt which we
have heard of in the Psalm, <span id="fr_2628"></span>[2629](#fn_2628.md)
had led the people through the Red Sea, when the waters retired, and had
received the Law, which he gave to this people. This was that whereupon
the Jewish nation was lifted up, and through this very pride it happened
that they were not willing to humble themselves to Christ the author of
humility, and the restrainer of proud swelling, to God the Physician,
who, being God, for this cause became Man, that man might know himself
to be but man. O mighty remedy! If this remedy cure not pride, I know
not what can cure it. He is God, and is made Man; He lays aside His
Divinity, that is, in a manner sequestrates, <span
id="fr_2629"></span>[2630](#fn_2629.md) hides, that is, what was His Own,
and appears only in that He had taken to Him. Being God He is made man:
and man will not acknowledge himself to be man, that is, will not
acknowledge himself to be mortal, will not acknowledge himself to be
frail, will not acknowledge himself to be a sinner, will not acknowledge
himself to be sick, that so at least as sick he may seek the physician;
but what is more perilous still, he fancies himself in sound health.

<span id="vii.xxix-p53"></span>12. So then for this reason that people
did not come to Him, that is by reason of pride; and the natural
branches are said to be broken off from the olive tree, that is from
that people founded <span id="fr_2630"></span>[2631](#fn_2630.md) by the
Patriarchs; in other words, the Jews are for their punishment justly
barren through the spirit of pride; and the wild olive is grafted into
that olive tree. The wild olive tree <span id="page_346">p. 346</span>
<span id="vii.xxix-Page_346"></span>is the people of the Gentiles. So
says the Apostle, “that the wild olive tree is grafted into the good
olive tree, but the natural branches are broken off.” <span
id="fr_2631"></span>[2632](#fn_2631.md) Because of pride they were broken
off: and the wild olive tree grafted in because of humility. This
humility did the woman show forth when she said, “Truth, Lord,” “I am a
dog, I desire only the crumbs.” In this humility also did the Centurion
please Him; who when he desired that his servant might be healed by the
Lord, and the Lord said, “I will come and heal him,” answered, “Lord, I
am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word
only, and my servant shall be healed. I am not worthy that Thou
shouldest come under my roof.” <span
id="fr_2632"></span>[2633](#fn_2632.md) He did not receive Him into his
house, but he had received Him already in his heart. The more humble,
the more capacious, and the more full. For the hills drive back the
water, but the valleys are filled by it. And what then, what said the
Lord to those who followed Him after that he had said, “I am not worthy
that Thou shouldest come under my roof”? “Verily I say unto you, I have
not found so great faith, no, not in Israel;” that is, in that people to
whom I came, “I have not found so great faith.” And whence great? Great
from being the least, that is, great from humility. “I have not found so
great faith;” like a grain of mustard seed, which by how much smaller it
is, by so much the more burning is it. Therefore did the Lord at once
graft the wild olive into the good olive tree. He did it then when He
said, “Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not
in Israel.”

<span id="vii.xxix-p57"></span>13. Lastly, mark what follows.
“Therefore,”—that is, because “I have not found so great faith in
Israel,” that is, so great humility with faith,—“Therefore I say unto
you, that many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down
with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.” <span
id="fr_2633"></span>[2634](#fn_2633.md) “Shall sit,” that is, “shall rest.”
For we must not form notions of carnal banquets there, or desire any
such thing in that kingdom, as to change not vices for virtues, but only
to make an exchange of vices. For it is one thing to desire the kingdom
of heaven for the sake of wisdom and life eternal; another, for the sake
of earthly felicity, as though there we should have it in more abundant
and greater measure. If thou think to be rich in that kingdom, thou dost
not cut off, but only changest desire; and yet rich thou wilt really be,
and in none other place but there wilt thou be rich; for here thy want
gathers together the abundance of things. Why have rich men much?
Because they want much. A greater want heaps together as it were greater
means; there want itself shall die. Then thou shalt be truly rich, when
thou shalt be in want of nothing. For now thou art not surely rich, and
an Angel poor, who has not horses, and carriages, and servants. Why?
Because he does not want any of these: because in proportion to his
greater strength, is his want the less. Therefore there there are
riches, and the true riches. Figure not to yourselves then banquets of
this earth in that place. For the banquets of this world are daily
medicines; they are necessary for a kind of sickness we have, wherewith
we are born. This sickness every one is sensible of, when the hour for
refreshment is passed. Wouldest thou see how great a sickness this is,
that as an acute fever would be fatal in seven days? Do not fancy
thyself then to be in health. Immortality will be health. For this
present is only one long sickness. Because thou dost support thy disease
by daily medicines; thou fanciest thyself in health; take away the
medicines, and then see what thou canst do.

<span id="vii.xxix-p59"></span>14. For from the moment we are born, we
must needs be dying. This disease must needs bring us to death. This
indeed physicians say when they examine their patients. For instance,
“This man has the dropsy, he is dying; this disease cannot be cured.
This man has the leprosy: <span id="fr_2634"></span>[2635](#fn_2634.md)
this disease too cannot be cured. He is in a consumption. Who can cure
this? He must needs die, he must perish.” See, the physician has now
pronounced that he is in a consumption; that he cannot but die; and yet
sometimes the dropsical patient does not die of his disease, and the
leprous does not die of his, nor the consumptive patient of his; but now
it is absolutely necessary that every one who is born should die of
this. He dies of it, he cannot do otherwise. This the physician and the
unskilled both pronounce upon; and though he die somewhat more slowly,
does he on that account not die? Where then is there true health, except
where there is true immortality? But if it be true immortality, and no
corruption, no wasting, what need will there be there of nourishment?
Therefore, when you hear it said, “They shall sit down with Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob;” <span id="fr_2635"></span>[2636](#fn_2635.md) get not
your body, but your soul in order. There shall thou be filled; and this
inner <span id="fr_2636"></span>[2637](#fn_2636.md) man has its proper
food. In relation to it is it said, “Blessed are they which do hunger
and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.” <span
id="fr_2637"></span>[2638](#fn_2637.md) And so truly filled shall they be
that they shall hunger no more.

<span id="vii.xxix-p64"></span>15. Therefore did the Lord graft in at
once the wild olive tree, when He said, “Many shall come from the east
and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the
kingdom of heaven;” that is, they shall be <span id="page_347">p.
347</span> <span id="vii.xxix-Page_347"></span>grafted into the good
olive tree. For Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, are the roots of this
olive tree; “but the children of the kingdom,” that is, the unbelieving
Jews, “shall go away into outer darkness.” The “natural branches shall
be broken off,” that the “wild olive tree may be grafted in.” Now why
did the natural branches deserve to be cut off, except for pride? why
the wild olive tree to be grafted in, except for humility? Whence also
that woman said, “Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall

And thereupon she hears, “O woman, great is thy faith.” <span
id="fr_2639"></span>[2640](#fn_2639.md) And so again that centurion, “I am
not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof.” <span
id="fr_2640"></span>[2641](#fn_2640.md) “Verily I say unto you, I have not
found so great faith, no, not in Israel.” <span
id="fr_2641"></span>[2642](#fn_2641.md) Let us then learn, or let us hold
fast, humility. If we have it not yet, let us learn it; if we have it,
let us not lose it. If we have it not yet, let us have it, that we may
be grafted in; if we have it already, let us hold it fast, that we may
not be cut off.
