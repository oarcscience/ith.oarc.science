<span id="vi.vi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Of the Manner in Which It Can Be
Shown that No Discrepancies Exist Between Them in the Accounts Which
They Give of the Words Which Were Spoken by the Lord, on to the Time of
His Leaving the House in Which They Had Supped.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.iv-p2"></span>9. At this point, therefore, we may now
follow, as far as we can, the order of the narrative, as gathered from
all the evangelists together. Thus, then, after the prediction in
question had been made to Peter, according to John’s version, the same
John proceeds with his statement, and introduces in this connection the
Lord’s discourse, which was to the following effect: “Let not your heart
be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house
are many mansions;” <span id="fr_1259"></span>[1260](#fn_1259) and so
forth. He narrates at length the sayings, so memorable and so
pre-eminently sublime, of which He delivered Himself in the course of
that address, until, in due connection, he comes to the passage where
the Lord speaks as follows: “O righteous Father, the world hath not
known Thee: but I have known Thee, and these have known that Thou hast
sent me. And I have declared unto them Thy name, and will declare it;
that the love wherewith Thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in
them.” <span id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260) Again we find,
according to the narrative given by Luke, that there arose “a strife
among them which of them should be accounted the greatest. And He said
unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and
they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye
shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the
younger; <span id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261) and he that is
chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is greater, he that sitteth at
meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among
you as he that serveth. And ye are <span id="page_181">p. 181</span>
<span id="vi.vi.iv-Page_181"></span>they which have continued with me in
my temptations: and I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath
appointed unto me; that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom,
and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”  <span
id="fr_1262"></span>[1263](#fn_1262) The said Luke also immediately
subjoins to these words the following passage: “And the Lord said to
Simon: Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift
you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and
when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. And he said unto Him:
Lord, I am ready to go with Thee, both into prison, and to death. And He
said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that
thou shall thrice deny that thou knowest me. And He said unto them, When
I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye anything? And
they said, Nothing. Then said He unto them, But now, he that hath a
purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no
sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. For I say unto you, this
that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And He was reckoned
among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end. And
they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said unto them, It
is enough.” <span id="fr_1263"></span>[1264](#fn_1263) Next comes the
passage, given both by Matthew and by Mark: “And when they had sung an
hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives. Then saith Jesus unto
them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is
written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be
scattered abroad. But after I am risen again, I will go before you into
Galilee. Peter answered and said unto Him, Though all men shall be
offended because of Thee, yet will I never be offended. Jesus saith unto
him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou
shalt deny me thrice. Peter saith unto Him, Though I should die with
Thee, yet will I not deny Thee. Likewise also said all the
disciples.” <span id="fr_1264"></span>[1265](#fn_1264) We have
introduced the preceding section as it is presented by Matthew. But Mark
also records it almost in so many and the same words, with the exception
of the apparent discrepancy, which we have already cleared up above, on
the subject of the crowing of the cock.
