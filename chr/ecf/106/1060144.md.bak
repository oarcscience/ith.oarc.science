<span id="vi.v.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVII.—Of His Walking Upon the
Water, and of the Questions Regarding the Harmony of the Evangelists Who
Have Narrated that Scene, and Regarding the Manner in Which They Pass
Off from the Section Recording the Occasion on Which He Fed the
Multitudes with the Five Loaves.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xlviii-p2"></span>99. Matthew goes on with his account in
the <span id="page_150">p. 150</span> <span
id="vi.v.xlviii-Page_150"></span>following terms: “And when He had sent
the multitudes away, He went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when
the evening was come, He was there alone. But the ship was now in the
midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. And in
the fourth watch of the night He came unto them, walking on the sea. And
when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled,
saying, It is a spirit;” and so on, down to the words, “They came and
worshipped Him, saying, Of a truth Thou art the Son of God.” <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063.md) In like manner, Mark, after
narrating the miracle of the five loaves, gives his account of this same
incident in the following terms: “And when it was late, the ship was in
the midst of the sea, and He alone on the land. And He saw them toiling
in rowing: for the wind was contrary to them,” and so on. <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064.md) This is similar to Matthew’s
version, except that nothing is said as to Peter’s walking upon the
waters. But here we must see to it, that no difficulty be found in what
Mark has stated regarding the Lord, namely, that, when He walked upon
the waters, He would also have passed by them. For in what way could
they have understood this, were it not that He was really proceeding in
a different direction from them, as if minded to pass those persons by
like strangers, who were so far from recognizing Him that they took Him
to be a spirit? Who, however, is so obtuse as not to perceive that this
bears a mystical significance? At the same time, too, He came to the
help of the men in their perturbation and outcry, and said to them, “Be
of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid.” What is the explanation,
therefore, of His wish to pass by those persons whom nevertheless He
thus encouraged when they were in terror, but that that intention to
pass them by was made to serve the purpose of drawing forth those cries
to which it was meet to bear succour?

<span id="vi.v.xlviii-p5"></span>100. Furthermore, John still tarries
for a little space with these others. For, after his recital of the
miracle of the five loaves, he also gives us some account of the vessel
that laboured, and of the Lord’s act in walking upon the sea. This
notice he connects with his preceding narrative in the following manner:
“When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take Him by
force and make Him a king, He departed again into a mountain Himself
alone. And when it became late, His disciples went down unto the sea;
and when they had entered into a ship, they came over the sea to
Capharnaum: and it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. And the
sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew,” and so on. <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065.md) In this there cannot appear to be
anything contrary to the records preserved in the other Gospels, unless
it be the circumstance that Matthew tells us how, when the multitudes
were sent away, He went up into a mountain, in order that there He might
pray alone; while John states that He was on a mountain with those same
multitudes whom He fed with the five loaves. <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066.md) But seeing that John also informs
us how He departed into a mountain after the said miracle, to preclude
His being taken possession of by the multitudes, who wished to make Him
a king, it is surely evident that they had come down from the mountain
to more level ground when those loaves were provided for the crowds. And
consequently there is no contradiction between the statements made by
Matthew and John as to His going up again to the mountain. The only
difference is, that Matthew uses the phrase “He went up,” while John’s
term is “He departed.” And there would be an antagonism between these
two, only if in departing He had not gone up. Nor, again, is any want of
harmony betrayed by the fact that Matthew’s words are, “He went up into
a mountain apart to pray;” whereas John puts it thus: “When He perceived
that they would come to make Him a king, He departed again into a
mountain Himself alone.” Surely the matter of the departure is in no way
a thing antagonistic to the matter of prayer. For, indeed, the Lord, who
in His own person transformed the body of our humiliation in order that
He might make it like unto the body of His own glory, <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067.md) hereby taught us also the truth
that the matter of departure should be to us in like manner grave matter
for prayer. Neither, again, is there any defect of consistency proved by
the circumstance that Matthew has told us first how He commanded His
disciples to embark in the little ship, and to go before Him unto the
other side of the lake until He sent the multitudes away, and then
informs us that, after the multitudes were sent away, He Himself went up
into a mountain alone to pray; while John mentions first that He
departed unto a mountain alone, and then proceeds thus: “And when it
became late, His disciples came down unto the sea; and when they had
entered into a ship,” etc. For who will not perceive that, in
recapitulating the facts, John has spoken of something as actually done
at a later point by the disciples, which Jesus had already charged them
to do before His own departure unto the mountain; just as it is a
familiar procedure in discourse, to revert in some fashion or other to
any matter <span id="page_151">p. 151</span> <span
id="vi.v.xlviii-Page_151"></span>which otherwise would have been passed
over? But inasmuch as it may not be specifically noted that a reversion,
especially when done briefly and instantaneously, is made to something
omitted, the auditors are sometimes led to suppose that the occurrence
which is mentioned at the later stage also took place literally at the
later period. In this way the evangelist’s statement really is, that to
those persons whom he had described as embarking in the ship and coming
across the sea to Capharnaum, the Lord came, walking toward them upon
the waters, as they were toiling in the deep; which approach of the Lord
of course took place at the earlier point, during the said voyage in
which they were making their way to Capharnaum. <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md)

<span id="vi.v.xlviii-p10"></span>101. On the other hand, Luke, after
the record of the miracle of the five loaves, passes to another subject,
and diverges from this order of narration. For he makes no mention of
that little ship, and of the Lord’s pathway over the waters. But after
the statement conveyed in these words, “And they did all eat, and were
filled, and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve
baskets,” he has subjoined the following notice: “And it came to pass,
as He was alone praying, His disciples were with Him; and He asked them,
saying, Who say the people that I am?” <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069.md) Thus he relates in this succession
something new, which is not given by those three who have left us the
account of the manner in which the Lord walked upon the waters, and came
to the disciples when they were on the voyage. It ought not, however, on
this account, to be supposed that it was on that same mountain to which
Matthew has told us He went up in order to pray alone, that He said to
His disciples, “Who say the people that I am?” For Luke, too, seems to
harmonize with Matthew in this, because his words are, “as He was alone
praying;” while Matthew’s were, “He went up unto a mountain alone to
pray.” But it must by all means be held to have been on a different
occasion that He put this question, since \[it is said here, both that\]
He prayed alone, and \[that\] the disciples were with Him. Thus Luke,
indeed, has mentioned only the fact of His being alone, but has said
nothing of His being without His disciples, as is the case with Matthew
and John, since \[according to these latter\] they left Him in order to
go before Him to the other side of the sea. For with unmistakeable
plainness Luke has added the statement that “His disciples also were
with Him.” Consequently, in saying that He was alone, he meant his
statement to refer to the multitudes, who did not abide with Him.
