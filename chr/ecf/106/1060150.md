<span id="vi.v.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIII.—Of the Occasion on Which He
Asked the Disciples Whom Men Said that He Was; And of the Question
Whether, with Regard Either to the Subject-Matter or the Order, There
are Any Discrepancies Between Matthew, Mark, and Luke.</span>

<span id="vi.v.liv-p2"></span>108. Matthew continues thus: “And Jesus
came into the coasts of Cæsarea Philippi; and He asked His disciples,
saying, Whom do men say that I, <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) the Son of man, am? And they said,
Some say that Thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias; and others,
Jeremias, or one of the prophets;” and so on, down to the words, “And
<span id="page_154">p. 154</span> <span
id="vi.v.liv-Page_154"></span>whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall
be loosed in heaven.” <span id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md) Mark
relates this nearly in the same order. But he has brought in before it a
narrative which is given by him alone,—namely, that regarding the giving
of sight to that blind man who said to the Lord, “I see men as trees
walking.” <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md) Luke, again, also
records this incident, inserting it after his account of the miracle of
the five loaves; <span id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md) and, as we
have already shown above, the order of recollection which is followed in
his case is not antagonistic to the order adopted by these others. Some
difficulty, however, may be imagined in the circumstance that Luke’s
representation bears that the Lord put this question, as to whom men
held Him to be, to His disciples at a time when He was alone praying,
and when His disciples were also with Him; whereas Mark, on the other
hand, tells us that the question was put by Him to the disciples when
they were on the way. But this will be a difficulty only to the man who
has never prayed on the way. <span id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md)

<span id="vi.v.liv-p8"></span>109. I recollect having already stated
that no one should suppose that Peter received that name for the first
time on the occasion when He said to Him, “Thou art Peter, and upon this
rock I will build my Church.” For the time at which he did obtain this
name was that referred to by John, when he mentions that he was
addressed in these terms: “Thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, by
interpretation, Peter.” <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090.md)
Hence, too, we are as little to think that Peter got this designation on
the occasion to which Mark alludes, when he recounts the twelve apostles
individually by name, and tells us how James and John were called the
sons of thunder, merely on the ground that in that passage he has
recorded the fact that He surnamed him Peter. <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091.md) For that circumstance is noticed
there simply because it was suggested to the writer’s recollection at
that particular point, and not because it took place in actual fact at
that specific time.
