<span id="vi.v.lxxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lxxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXIX.—Of the Concord Between
Matthew, Mark, and John in Their Notices of the Supper at Bethany, at
Which the Woman Poured the Precious Ointment on the Lord, and of the
Method in Which These Accounts are to Be Harmonized with that of Luke,
When He Records an Incident of a Similar Nature at a Different
Period.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxxx-p2"></span>154. Matthew, then, continuing his
narrative from the point up to which we had concluded its examination,
proceeds in the following terms: “Then assembled together the chief
priests and the elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest,
who was called Caiaphas, and consulted that they might take Jesus by
subtilty and kill Him: but they said, Not on the feast-day, lest there
be an uproar among the people. Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the
house of Simon the leper, there came unto Him a woman having an
alabaster box of precious ointment, and poured it on His head as He sat
at meat;” and so on down to the words, “there shall also this that this
woman hath done be told for a memorial of her.” <span
id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208.md) The scene with the woman and the
costly ointment at Bethany we have now to consider, as it is thus
detailed. For although Luke records an incident resembling this, and
although the name which he assigns to the person in whose house the Lord
was supping might also suggest an identity between the two narratives
(for Luke likewise names the host “Simon”), still, since there is
nothing either in nature or in the customs of men to make the case an
incredible one, that as one man may have two names, two men may with all
the greater likelihood have one and the same name, it is more reasonable
to believe that the Simon in whose house \[it is thus supposed,
according to Luke’s version, that\] this scene at Bethany took place,
was a different person from the Simon \[named by Matthew\]. For Luke,
again, does not specify Bethany as the place where the incident which he
records happened. And although it is true that he in no way
particularizes the town or village in which that occurrence took place,
still his narrative does not seem to deal with the same locality.
Consequently, my opinion is, that there is but one interpretation to be
put upon the matter. That is not, however, to suppose that the woman who
appears in Matthew was an entirely different person from the woman who
approached the feet of Jesus on that occasion in the character of a
sinner, and kissed them, and washed them with her tears, and wiped them
with her hair, and anointed them with ointment, in reference to whose
case Jesus also made use of the parable of the two debtors, and said
that her sins, which were many, were forgiven her because she loved
much. But my theory is, that it was the same Mary who did this deed on
two separate occasions, the one being that which Luke has put on record,
when she approached Him first of all in that remarkable humility, and
with those tears, and obtained the forgiveness of her sins. <span
id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209.md) For John, too, although he has not
given the kind of recital which Luke has left us of the circumstances
connected with that incident, has at least mentioned the fact, in
commending the same Mary to our notice, when he has just begun to tell
the story of the raising of Lazarus, and before his narrative brings the
Lord to Bethany itself. The history which he offers us of that
transaction proceeds thus: “Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus,
of Bethany, the town of Mary, and her sister <span id="page_173">p.
173</span> <span id="vi.v.lxxx-Page_173"></span>Martha. It was that Mary
which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair,
whose brother Lazarus was sick.” <span
id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210.md) By this statement John attests what
Luke has told us when he records a scene of this nature in the house of
a certain Pharisee, whose name was Simon. Here, then, we see that Mary
had acted in this way before that time. And what she did a second time
in Bethany is a different matter, which does not belong to Luke’s
narrative, but is related by three of the evangelists in concert,
namely, John, Matthew, and Mark. <span
id="fr_1211"></span>[1212](#fn_1211.md)

<span id="vi.v.lxxx-p7"></span>155. Let us therefore notice how harmony
is maintained here between these three evangelists, Matthew, Mark, and
John, regarding whom there is no doubt that they record the self-same
occurrence at Bethany, on occasion of which the disciples also, as all
three mention, murmured against the woman, ostensibly on the ground of
the waste of the very precious ointment. Now the further fact that
Matthew and Mark tell us that it was the Lord’s head on which the
ointment was poured, while John says it was His feet, can be shown to
involve no contradiction, if we apply the principle which we have
already expounded in dealing with the scene of the feeding of the
multitudes with the five loaves. For as there was one writer who, in
giving his account of that incident, did not fail to specify that the
people sat down at once by fifties and by hundreds, although another
spoke only of the fifties, no contradiction could be supposed to emerge.
There might indeed have seemed to be some difficulty, if the one
evangelist had referred only to the hundreds, and the other only to the
fifties; and yet, even in that case, the correct finding should have
been to the effect that they were seated both by fifties and by
hundreds. And this example ought to have made it plain to us, as I
pressed it upon my readers in discussing that section, that even where
the several evangelists introduce only the one fact each, we should take
the case to have been really, that both things were elements in the
actual occurrence. <span id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212.md) In the
same way, our conclusion with regard to the passage now before us should
be, that the woman poured the ointment not only upon the Lord’s head,
but also on His feet. It is true that some person may possibly be found
absurd and artful enough to argue, that because Mark states that the
ointment was poured out only after the alabaster vase was broken there
could not have remained in the shattered vessel anything with which she
could anoint His feet. But while a person of that character, in his
endeavours to disprove the veracity of the Gospel, may contend that the
vase was broken, in a manner making it impossible that any portion of
the contents could have been left in it, how much better and more
accordant with piety must the position of a very different individual
appear, whose aim will be to uphold the truthfulness of the Gospel, and
who may therefore contend that the vessel was not broken in a manner
involving the total outpouring of the ointment! Moreover, if that
calumniator is so persistently blinded as to attempt to shatter the
harmony of the evangelists on this subject of the shattering of the
vase, <span id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213.md) he should rather accept
the alternative, that the \[Lord’s\] feet were anointed before the
vessel itself was broken, and that it thus remained whole, and filled
with ointment sufficient for the anointing also of the head, when, by
the breakage referred to, the entire contents were discharged. For we
allow that there is a due regard to the several parts of our nature when
the act commences with the head, but \[we may also say that\] an equally
natural order is preserved when we ascend from the feet to the head.

<span id="vi.v.lxxx-p10"></span>156. The other matters belonging to this
incident do not seem to me to raise any question really involving a
difficulty. There is the circumstance that the other evangelists mention
how the disciples murmured about the \[wasteful\] outpouring of the
precious ointment, whereas John states that Judas was the person who
thus expressed himself, and tells us, in explanation of the fact, that
“he was a thief.” But I think it is evident that this same Judas was the
person referred to under the \[general\] name of the disciples, the
plural number being used here instead of the singular, in accordance
with that mode of speech of which we have already introduced an
explanation in the case of Philip and the miracle of the five
loaves. <span id="fr_1214"></span>[1215](#fn_1214.md) It may also be
understood in this way, that the other disciples either felt as Judas
felt, or spoke as he did, or were brought over to that view of the
matter by what Judas said, and that Matthew and Mark consequently have
expressed in word what was really the mind of the whole company; but
that Judas spoke as he did just because he was a thief, whereas what
prompted the rest was their care for the poor; and further, that John
has chosen to record the utterance of such sentiments only in the
instance of that one \[among the disciples\] whose habit of acting the
thief he believed it right to bring out in connection with this
occasion.
