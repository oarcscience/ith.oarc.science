<span id="vii.xxxi-p3"></span>*Again on the words of the Gospel,* <span

the mount to His three disciples.*

<span id="vii.xxxi-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p4.1"></span>We</span> heard when the Holy Gospel was being
read of the great vision on the mount, in which Jesus showed Himself to
the three disciples, Peter, James, and John. “His face did shine as the
sun:” this is a figure of the shining of the Gospel. “His raiment was
white as the snow:” <span id="fr_2665"></span>[2666](#fn_2665.md) this is a
figure of the purity of the Church, to which it was said by the Prophet,
“Though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow.” <span
id="fr_2666"></span>[2667](#fn_2666.md) Elias and Moses were talking with
Him; because the grace of the Gospel receives witness from the Law and
the Prophets. The Law is represented in Moses, the Prophets in Elias; to
speak briefly. For there are the mercies of God vouchsafed through a
holy Martyr to be rehearsed. Let us give ear. Peter desired three
tabernacles to be made, one for Moses, one for Elias, and one for
Christ. The solitude of the mountain had charms for him; he had been
wearied with the tumult of the world’s business. But why sought he three
tabernacles, but because he knew not as yet the unity of the Law, and of
Prophecy, and of the Gospel? Lastly, he was corrected by the cloud,
“While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them.” Lo, the
cloud hath made one tabernacle; wherefore didst thou seek for three?
“And a voice came out of the cloud, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased, hear ye Him.” <span id="fr_2667"></span>[2668](#fn_2667.md)
Elias speaketh; but “hear Him;” “Moses speaketh; but “hear Him.” The
Prophets speak, the Law speaketh; but “hear Him,” who is the voice of
the Law, and the tongue of the Prophets. He spake in them, and when He
vouchsafed so to do, He appeared in His own person. “Hear ye Him:” let
us then hear Him. When the Gospel spake, think it was the cloud: from
thence hath the voice sounded out to us. Let us hear Him; that is, let
us do what He saith, let us hope for what He hath promised.
