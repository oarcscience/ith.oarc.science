<span id="v.iii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xv-p2"></span>49. “Therefore,” says He, “I say unto you,
Have not anxiety <span id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md) for your life,
what ye shall eat; <span id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md) nor yet for
your body, what ye shall put on.” Lest perchance, although it is not now
superfluities that are sought after, the heart should be made double by
reason of necessaries themselves, and the aim should be wrenched aside
to seek after those things of our own, when we are doing something as it
were from compassion; *i.e.* so that when we wish to appear to be
consulting for some one’s good, we are in that matter looking after our
own profit rather than his advantage: and we do not seem to ourselves to
be sinning for this reason, that it is not superfluities, but
necessaries, which we wish <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span
id="v.iii.xv-Page_50"></span>to obtain. But the Lord admonishes us that
we should remember that God, when He made and compounded us of body and
soul, gave us much more than food and clothing, through care for which
He would not have us make our hearts double. “Is not,” says He, “the
soul more than the meat?” So that you are to understand that He who gave
the soul will much more easily give meat. “And the body than the
raiment,” *i.e.* is more than raiment: so that similarly you are to
understand, that He who gave the body will much more easily give
raiment.

<span id="v.iii.xv-p5"></span>50. And in this passage the question is
wont to be raised, whether the food spoken of has reference to the soul,
since the soul is incorporeal, and the food in question is corporeal
food. But let us admit that the soul in this passage stands for the
present life, whose support is that corporeal nourishment. In accordance
with this signification we have also that statement: “He that loveth his
soul shall lose it.” <span id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md) And here,
unless we understand the expression of this present life, which we ought
to lose for the kingdom of God, as it is clear the martyrs were able to
do, this precept will be in contradiction to that sentence where it is
said: “What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and
lose <span id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md) his own soul?” <span
id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387.md)

<span id="v.iii.xv-p9"></span>51. “Behold,” says He, “the fowls of the
air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet
your heavenly Father feedeth them: are ye not much better than they?”
*i.e.* ye are of more value. For surely a rational being such as man has
a higher rank in the nature of things than irrational ones, such as
birds. “Which of you, by taking thought, <span
id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md) can add one cubit unto his
stature? <span id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389.md) And why take ye thought
for raiment?” That is to say, the providence of Him by whose power and
sovereignty it has come about that your body was brought up to its
present stature, can also clothe you; but that it is not by your care
that it has come about that your body should arrive at this stature, may
be understood from this circumstance, that if you should take thought,
and should wish to add one cubit to this stature, you cannot. Leave,
therefore, the care of protecting the body to Him by whose care you see
it has come about that you have a body of such a stature.

<span id="v.iii.xv-p12"></span>52. But an example was to be given for
the clothing too, just as one is given for the food. Hence He goes on to
say, “Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not,
neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon <span
id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390.md) in all his glory was not arrayed <span
id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391.md) like one of these. Wherefore, if God
so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast
into the oven; shall He not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?”
But these examples are not to be treated as allegories, so that we
should inquire what the fowls of heaven or the lilies of the field mean:
for they stand here, in order that from smaller matters we may be
persuaded respecting greater ones; <span
id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392.md) just as is the case in regard to the
judge who neither feared God nor regarded man, and yet yielded to the
widow who often importuned him to consider her case, not from piety or
humanity, but that he might be saved annoyance. For that unjust judge
does not in any way allegorically represent the person of God; but yet
as to how far God, who is good and just, cares for those who supplicate
Him, our Lord wished the inference to be drawn from this circumstance,
that not even an unjust man can despise those who assail him with
unceasing petitions, even were his motive merely to avoid
annoyance. <span id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393.md)

<span id="v.iii.xv-p11"></span> The term <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.xv-p11.1"></span> ἡλικία</span>, translated by Augustin and
the Vulgate *statura*, and by the English version *stature*, more
probably means the *measure of life*, or *age* (American notes to
Revised Version, Tholuck, De Wette, Trench, Alford, Meyer, Schaff,
Plumptre, Weiss, etc.) A cubit was equal to the length of the forearm.
The force of the Lord’s words would be greatly diminished if such a
measure was conceived of as possible to be added to the stature. The
idea is, that human ingenuity and labor cannot add the least measure.

spiritual growth is mysterious and spontaneous.
