<span id="vi.v.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Of the Order of the Incidents
Which are Recorded After This Section and of the Question Whether
Matthew, Mark, and Luke are Consistent with Each Other in These.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxiii-p2"></span>53. Matthew, accordingly, continues his
narration thus: “Now when the even was come, they brought unto Him many
that were possessed with devils; and He cast out the spirits with His
word, and healed all that were sick: that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities,
and bare our sicknesses.” <span id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881.md) That
this belongs in date to the same day, he indicates with sufficient
clearness by these words which he subjoins, “Now when the even was
come.” In a similar manner, after concluding his account of the healing
of Peter’s mother-in-law with the sentence, “And she ministered unto
them,” Mark has appended the following statement: “And at even, when the
sun did set, they brought unto Him all that were diseased, and them that
were possessed of the devils. And all the city was gathered together at
the door. And He healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast
out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew
Him. And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, He went
out, and departed into a solitary place.” <span
id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882.md) Here Mark appears to have preserved
the order in such wise, that after the statement conveyed in the words
“And at even,” he gives this note of time: “And in the morning, rising
up a great while before day.” And although there is no absolute
necessity for supposing either that, when we have the words “And at
even,” the reference must be to the evening of the very same day, or
that when the phrase “In the morning” meets us, it must mean the morning
 <span id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883.md) after the self-same night;
still, however that may be, this order in the occurrences may fairly
appear to have been preserved with a view to an orderly arrangement of
the times. Moreover, Luke, too, after relating the story of Peter’s
mother-in-law, while he does not indeed say expressly, “And at even,”
has at least used a phrase which conveys the same sense. For he proceeds
thus: “Now when the sun had set, <span id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884.md)
all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto Him;
and He laid His hands on every one of them, and healed them. And devils
also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son
of God. And He, rebuking them, suffered them not to speak: for they knew
that He was Christ. And when it was day, He departed and went into a
desert place.” <span id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885.md) Here, again, we
see precisely the same order of times preserved as we discovered in
Mark. But Matthew, who appears to have introduced the story of Peter’s
mother-in-law not according to the order in which the incident itself
took place, but simply in the succession in which he had it suggested to
his mind after previous omission, has first recorded what happened on
that same day, to wit, when even was come; and thereafter, instead of
subjoining the notice of the *morning*, goes on with his account in
these terms: “Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave
commandment to depart unto the other side of the lake.” <span
id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886.md) This, then, is something new,
differing from what is given in the context by Mark and Luke, who, after
the notice of the *even*, bring in the mention of the *morning*.
Consequently, as regards this verse in Matthew, “Now when Jesus saw
great multitudes about Him, He gave commandment to depart unto the other
side of the lake,” we ought simply to understand that he has introduced
here another fact which he has had brought to mind at this
point,—namely, the fact that on a certain day, when Jesus had seen great
multitudes about Him, He gave instructions to cross to the other side of
the lake.
