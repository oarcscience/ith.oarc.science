<span id="vii.lx-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.lx-p1.1"></span>Sermon LVIII.</span>

<span id="vii.lx-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.lx-p2.1"></span>\[CVIII. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.lx-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.lx-p3.1"></span>*[Luke xii.
35](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035.md)<span id="vii.lx-p3.2"></span>, “Let
your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning; and be ye yourselves
like,” etc. And on the words of the* [Psa.
34.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#012.md)<span id="vii.lx-p3.3"></span>*,
“what man is he that desireth life,” etc.*

<span id="vii.lx-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.lx-p4.1"></span>Our</span> Lord Jesus Christ both came to men,
and went away from men, and is to come to men. And yet He was here when
He came, nor did He depart when He went away, and He is to come to them
to whom He said, “Lo, I am with you, even unto the end of the
world.” <span id="fr_3416"></span>[3417](#fn_3416.md) According to the
“form of a servant” then, which He took for our sakes, was He born at a
certain time, and was slain, and rose again, and now “dieth no more,
neither shall death have any more dominion over Him;” <span
id="fr_3417"></span>[3418](#fn_3417.md) but according to His Divinity,
wherein He was equal to the Father, was He already in this world, and
“the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.” <span
id="fr_3418"></span>[3419](#fn_3418.md) On this point ye have just heard
the Gospel, what admonition it has given us, putting us on our guard,
and wishing us to be unencumbered and prepared to await the end; that
after these last <span id="fr_3419"></span>[3420](#fn_3419.md) things,
which are to be feared in this world, that rest may succeed which hath
no end. Blessed are they who shall be partakers of it. For then shall
they be in security, who are not in security now; and again then shall
they fear, who will not fear now. Unto this waiting, and for this hope’s
sake, have we been made Christians. Is not our hope not of this world?
Let us then not love the world. From the love of this world have we been
called away, that we may hope for and love another. In this world ought
we to abstain from all unlawful desires, to have, that is, “our loins
girded;” and to be fervent and to shine in good works, that is, to have
“our lights burning.” For the Lord Himself said to His disciples in
another place of the Gospel, “No man lighteth a candle and putteth it
under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that it may give light unto all
that are in the house.” <span id="fr_3420"></span>[3421](#fn_3420.md) And
to show of what He was speaking, He subjoined and said, “Let your light
so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
Father which is in heaven.” <span id="fr_3421"></span>[3422](#fn_3421.md)

<span id="vii.lx-p11"></span>2. Therefore He would that “our loins
should be girded, and our lights burning.” <span
id="fr_3422"></span>[3423](#fn_3422.md) What is, “our loins girded”?
“Depart from evil.” <span id="fr_3423"></span>[3424](#fn_3423.md) What is
to “burn”? What is to have our “lights burning”? It is this, “And do
good.” What is that which He said afterwards, “And ye yourselves like
unto men that wait for their Lord, when He will return from the
wedding:” <span id="fr_3424"></span>[3425](#fn_3424.md) except that which
follows in that Psalm, “Seek after peace, and ensue it”? <span
id="fr_3425"></span>[3426](#fn_3425.md) These three things, that is,
“abstaining from evil, and doing good,” and the hope of everlasting
reward, are recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, where it is written,
that Paul taught them of “temperance and righteousness,” <span
id="fr_3426"></span>[3427](#fn_3426.md) and the hope of eternal life. To
temperance belongs, “let your loins be girded.” To righteousness, “and
your lights burning.” To the hope of eternal life, the waiting for the
Lord. So then, “depart from evil,” this is temperance, these are the
loins girded: “and do good,” this is righteousness, these are the
“lights burning;” “seek peace, and ensue it,” this is the waiting for
the world to come: therefore, “Be ye like unto men that wait for their
Lord, when He will come from the wedding.”

<span id="vii.lx-p17"></span>3. Having then these precepts and promises,
why seek we on earth for “good days,” where we cannot find them? For I
know that ye do seek them, when ye are either sick, or in any of the
tribulations, which in this world abound. For when life draws towards
its close, the old man is full of complaints, and with no joys. Amid all
the tribulations by which mankind is worn away, men seek for nothing but
“good days,” and wish for a long life, which here they cannot have. For
even a man’s long life is narrowed within so short a span to the wide
extent of all ages, as if it were but one drop to the whole sea. What
then is man’s life, even that which is called a long one? They call that
a long life, which even in this world’s course is short; and as I have
said, groans abound even unto the decrepitude of old age. This at the
most is but brief, and of short duration; and yet how eagerly is it
sought by men, with how great diligence, with how great toil, with how
great carefulness, with how great watchfulness, with how great labour do
men seek to live here for a long time, and to grow old. And yet this
very living long, what is it but running to the <span id="page_441">p.
441</span> <span id="vii.lx-Page_441"></span>end? Thou hadst yesterday,
and thou dost wish also to have to-morrow. But when this day and
to-morrow are passed, thou hast them not. Therefore thou dost wish for
the day to break, that that may draw near to thee whither thou hast no
wish to come. Thou makest some annual festival with thy friends, and
hearest it there said to thee by thy well-wishers, “Mayest thou live
many years,” thou dost wish that what they have said, may come to pass.
What? Dost thou wish that years and years may come, and the end of these
years come not? Thy wishes are contrary to one another; thou dost wish
to walk on, and dost not wish to reach the end.

<span id="vii.lx-p18"></span>4. But if, as I have said, there is so
great care in men, as to desire with daily, great and perpetual labours,
to die somewhat later: with how great cause ought they to strive, that
they may never die? Of this, no one will think. Day by day “good days”
are sought for in this world, where they are not found; yet no one
wishes so to live, that he may arrive there where they are found.
Therefore the same Scripture admonishes us, and says, “Who is the man
that wisheth for life, and loveth to see good days?” <span
id="fr_3427"></span>[3428](#fn_3427.md) Scripture so asked the question, as
that It knew well what answer would be given It; knowing that all men
would “seek for life and good days.” In accordance with their desire It
asked the question, as if the answer would be given It from the heart of
all, “I wish it;” It said thus, “Who is the man that wisheth for life,
and loveth to see good days?” Just as even at this very hour in which I
am speaking to you, when ye heard me say, “Who is the man that wisheth
for life, and loveth to see good days?” ye all answered in your heart,
“I.” For so do I too, who am speaking with you, “wish for life and good
days;” what ye seek, that do I seek also.

<span id="vii.lx-p20"></span>5. Just as if gold were necessary for us
all, and we all, I as well as you, were wishing to get at the gold, and
there was some anywhere in a field of yours, in a place subject to your
power, and I were to see you searching for it, and were to say to you,
“What are ye searching for?” ye were to answer me, “Gold.” And I were to
say to you, “Ye are searching for gold, and I am searching for gold too:
what ye are searching for, I am searching for; but ye are not searching
for it where we can find it. Listen to me then, where we can find it; I
am not taking it away from you, I am showing you the spot;” yea, let us
all follow Him, who knows where what we are seeking for, is. So now too
seeing that ye desire “life and good days,” we cannot say to you, “Do
not desire ‘life and good days;’” but this we say, “Do not seek for
‘life and good days’ here in this world, where ‘good days’ cannot be.”
Is not this life itself like unto death? Now these days here hasten and
pass away: for to-day has shut out yesterday; tomorrow only rises that
it may shut out to-day. These days themselves have no abiding; wherefore
wouldest thou abide with them? Your desire then whereby ye wish for
“life and good days,” I not only do not repress, but I even more
strongly inflame. By all means “seek” for “life, seek for good days;”
but let them be sought there, where they can be found.

<span id="vii.lx-p21"></span>6. For would ye with me hear His counsel,
who knoweth where “good days” and where “life” is? Hear it not from me,
but together with me. For One says to us, “Come, ye children, hearken
unto Me.” And let us run together, and stand, and prick up our ears, and
with our hearts understand the Father, who hath said, “Come, ye
children, hearken unto Me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3428"></span>[3429](#fn_3428.md) And then follows what he would
teach us, and to what end the fear of the Lord is useful. “Who is the
man that wisheth life, and loveth to see good days?” We all answer, “We
wish it.” Let us listen then to what follows, “Refrain thy tongue from
evil, and thy lips that they speak no guile.” <span
id="fr_3429"></span>[3430](#fn_3429.md) Now say, “I wish it.” Just now when
I said, “Who is the man that wisheth for life, and loveth to see good
days?” we all answered, “I.” Come then, let some one now answer “I.” So
then, “Refrain thy tongue from evil, and thy lips that they speak no
guile.” Now say, “I.” Wouldest thou then have “good days” and “life,”
and wouldest thou not “refrain thy tongue from evil, and thy lips that
they speak no guile”? Alert to the reward, slow to the work! And to whom
if he does not work is the reward rendered? I would that in thy house
thou wouldest render the reward even to him that does work! For to him
that works not, I am sure thou dost not render it. And why? Because thou
owest nothing to him that does not work! And God hath a reward proposed.
What reward? “Life and good days,” which life we all desire, and unto
which days we all strive to come. The promised reward He will give us.
What reward? “Life and good days.” And what are “good days”? Life
without end, rest without labour.

<span id="vii.lx-p24"></span>7. Great is the reward He hath set before
us: in so great a reward as is set before us, let us see what He hath
commanded us. For enkindled by the reward of so great a promise, and by
the love of the reward, let us make ready at once our strength, our
sides, our arms, to do His bidding. Is it as if He were to command us to
carry heavy burdens, to dig something it may be, or to raise up some
machine? No, no such <span id="page_442">p. 442</span> <span
id="vii.lx-Page_442"></span>laborious thing hath He enjoined thee, but
hath enjoined thee only to “refrain” that member which amongst all thy
members thou dost move so quickly. “Refrain thy tongue from evil.” It is
no labour to erect a building, and is it a labour to hold in the tongue?
“Refrain thy tongue from evil.” Speak no lie, speak no revilings, speak
no slanders, speak no false witnesses, speak no blasphemies. “Refrain
thy tongue from evil.” See how angry thou art, if any one speaks evil of
thee. As thou art angry with another, when he speaks evil of thee; so be
thou angry with thyself, when thou speakest evil of another. “Let thy
lips speak no guile.” What is in thine heart within, be that spoken out.
Let not thy breast conceal one thing, and thy tongue utter another.
“Depart from evil, and do good.” For how should I say, “Clothe the
naked,” to him who up to this time would strip him that is clothed? For
he that oppresses his fellow-citizen, how can he take in the stranger?
So then in proper order, first “depart from evil,” and “do good;” first
“gird up thy loins,” and then “light the lamp.” And when thou hast done
this, wait in assured hope for “life and good days.” “Seek peace, and
ensue it;” and then with a good face wilt thou say unto the Lord, “I
have done what Thou hast bidden, render me what Thou hast promised.”
