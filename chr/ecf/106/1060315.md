<span id="vii.xcviii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xcviii-p3.1"></span>*[John. xxi.
16](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#016.md)<span id="vii.xcviii-p3.2"></span>,
“Simon, son of John, lovest thou me?” etc.*

<span id="vii.xcviii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xcviii-p4.1"></span>Ye</span> have observed, beloved, that in
to-day’s lesson it was said by the Lord to Peter in a question, “Lovest
thou Me?” To whom he answered, “Thou knowest, Lord, that I love thee.”
This was done a second, and a third time; and at each several reply, the
Lord said, “Feed My lambs.” <span id="fr_4316"></span>[4317](#fn_4316.md)
To Peter did Christ commend His lambs to be fed, who fed even Peter
himself. For what could Peter do for the Lord, especially now that He
had an Immortal Body, and was about to ascend into heaven? As though He
had said to him, “‘Lovest thou Me?’ Herein show that thou lovest Me,
‘Feed my sheep.’” So then, Brethren, do ye with obedience hear that ye
are Christ’s sheep; seeing that we on our part with fear hear, Feed My
sheep”? If we feed with fear, and fear for the sheep; these sheep how
ought they to fear for themselves? Let then carefulness be our portion,
obedience yours; pastoral watchfulness our portion, the humility of the
flock yours. Although we too who seem to speak to you from a higher
place, are with fear beneath your feet; forasmuch as we know how
perilous an account must be rendered of this as it were exalted seat.
Wherefore, dearly beloved, Catholic plants, Members of Christ, think
What a Head ye have! Children of God, think What a Father ye have found.
Christians, think What an Inheritance is promised you. Not such as on
earth cannot be possessed by children, save when their parents are dead.
For no one on earth possesses a father’s inheritance, save when he is
dead. But we whilst our Father liveth shall possess what He shall give;
for that our Father cannot die. I add more, I say more, and say the
truth; our Father will Himself be our Inheritance.

<span id="vii.xcviii-p6"></span>2. Live consistently, especially ye
candidates of Christ, recently baptized, just regenerated, as I have
admonished you before, so say I now, and give expression to my
solicitude; for the present lesson of the Gospel hath forced upon me a
greater fear: take heed to yourselves, do not imitate evil Christians.
Say not I will do this, for many of the faithful do it. This is not to
procure a defence for the soul; but to look out for companions unto
hell. Grow ye in this floor of the Lord; herein ye will find good men to
<span id="page_544">p. 544</span> <span
id="vii.xcviii-Page_544"></span>please you, if ye yourselves are good.
For are ye our private property? Heretics and schismatics have made
their own private property out of what they have stolen from the Lord,
and would feed, not Christ’s flocks, but their own against Christ. It is
true indeed, they place His title on these their spoils, that their
robberies may be as it were maintained by the title of His Power. What
doeth Christ when such as these are converted, who have received the
title of His Baptism out of the Church? He casteth out the spoiler, He
doth not efface the title, and taketh possession of the house; because
He hath found His title there. What need is there that He should change
His Own Name? Do they take heed to what the Lord said to Peter, “Feed My
lambs, feed My sheep”? Did He say to him, “Feed thy lambs;” or, “Feed
thy sheep”? But for them who are shut out, what said He in the Song of
Songs, unto the Church? The Spouse speaking to the Bride, saith, “If
thou know not thyself, O thou fair one among women, go forth.” <span
id="fr_4317"></span>[4318](#fn_4317.md) As though He said, “I do not cast
thee out, ‘go forth, if thou know not thyself, O thou fair one among
women,’ if thou know not thyself in the mirror of divine Scripture, if
thou give not heed, O thou fair woman, to the mirror which with no false
lustre deceiveth thee; if thou know not that of thee it is said, ‘Thy
glory shall be above all earth;’ <span
id="fr_4318"></span>[4319](#fn_4318.md) that of thee it is said, ‘I will
give thee nations for thine inheritance, and the limits of the earth for
thy possession;’ <span id="fr_4319"></span>[4320](#fn_4319.md) and other
innumerable testimonies which set forth the Catholic Church. If then
thou know not these, thou hast no part in Me, thou canst not make
thyself My heir. ‘Go forth then in the footsteps of the flocks’ not in
the fellowship of the flock; and feed thy goats, not as it was said to
Peter, ‘My sheep.’” To Peter it was said, “My sheep;” to schismatics it
is said,” thy goats.” In the one place “sheep,” in the other “goats;” in
the one place “Mine,” in the other “thine.” Recollect the right Hand and
the left of our Judge; recollect where the goats shall stand, and where
the sheep; <span id="fr_4320"></span>[4321](#fn_4320.md) and it will be
plain to you where is the right hand, where the left, the white and the
black, the lightsome, and the darksome, the fair and the deformed, that
which is about to receive the kingdom, and that which is to find
everlasting punishment.
