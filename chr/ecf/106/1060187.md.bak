<span id="vi.vi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Of the Absence of Any
Discrepancies in the Accounts Which the Evangelists Give of What Took
Place in Pilate’s Presence.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.ix-p2"></span>32. He next proceeds as follows: “And
Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked Him, saying, Art
thou the King of the Jews? Jesus saith unto him, Thou sayest. And when
He was accused of the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.
Then saith Pilate unto Him, Hearest thou not how many things they
witness against thee? And He answered him to never a word; insomuch that
the governor marvelled greatly. Now at that feast the governor was wont
to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. And they had
then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. Therefore when they were
gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release
unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? For he knew that
for envy they had delivered Him. But when he was set down on the
judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do
with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream
because of him. But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude
that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. But the governor
answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release
unto you? And they said, Barabbas. Pilate saith unto them, What shall I
do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say, Let him be
crucified. The governor said to them, Why, what evil hath he done? But
they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. When Pilate saw
that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he
took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am
innocent of the blood of this just person; see ye to it. Then answered
all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. Then
released he Barabbas unto them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he
delivered Him to them to be crucified.” <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md) These are the things which Matthew
has reported to have been done to the Lord by Pilate.

<span id="vi.vi.ix-p4"></span>33. Mark also presents an almost entire
identity with the above, both in language and in subject. The words,
however, in which Pilate replied to the people when they asked him to
release one prisoner according to the custom of the feast, are reported
by this evangelist as follows: “But Pilate answered them, saying, Will
ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?” <span
id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349.md) On the other hand, Matthew gives
them thus: “Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto
them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is
called Christ?” There need be no difficulty in the circumstance that
Matthew says nothing about the people having requested that one should
be released unto them. But it may fairly be asked, what were the words
which Pilate actually uttered, whether these reported by Matthew, or
those recited by Mark. For there seems to be some difference between
these two forms of expression, namely, “Whom will ye that I release unto
you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?” and, “Will ye that I
release unto you the King of the Jews?” Nevertheless, as they were in
the habit of calling <span id="page_193">p. 193</span> <span
id="vi.vi.ix-Page_193"></span>their kings “anointed ones,” <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350.md) and one might use the one term or
the other, <span id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351.md) it is evident that
what Pilate asked them was whether they would have the King of the Jews,
that is, the Christ, released unto them. And it matters nothing to the
real identity in meaning that Mark, desiring simply to relate what
concerned the Lord Himself, has not mentioned Barabbas here. For, in the
report which he gives of their reply, he indicates with sufficient
clearness who the person was whom they asked to have released unto them.
His version is this: “But the chief priests moved the people, that he
should rather release Barabbas unto them.” Then he proceeds to add the
sentence, “And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye
then that I should do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?” This
makes it plain enough now, that in speaking of the King of the Jews,
Mark meant to express the very sense which Matthew intended to convey by
using the term “Christ.” For kings were not called “anointed ones”
 <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352.md) except among the Jews; and
the form which Matthew gives to the words in question is this, “Pilate
saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called
Christ?” So Mark continues, “And they cried out again, Crucify him:”
which appears thus in Matthew, “They all say unto him, Let him be
crucified.” Again Mark goes on, “Then Pilate said unto them Why, what
evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify
him.” Matthew has not recorded this passage; but he has introduced the
statement, “When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that
rather a tumult was made,” and has also informed us how he washed his
hands before the people with the view of declaring himself innocent of
the blood of that just person (a circumstance not reported by Mark and
the others). And thus he has also shown us with all due plainness how
the governor dealt with the people with the intention of securing His
release. This has been briefly referred to by Mark, when he tells us
that Pilate said, “Why, what evil hath he done?” And thereupon Mark also
concludes his account of what took place between Pilate and the Lord in
these terms: “And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released
Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged Him, to be
crucified.” The above is Mark’s recital of what occurred in presence of
the governor. <span id="fr_1353"></span>[1354](#fn_1353.md)

<span id="vi.vi.ix-p10"></span>34. Luke gives the following version of
what took place in presence of Pilate: “And they began to accuse Him,
saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to
give tribute to Cæsar, and saying that he himself is Christ a
king.” <span id="fr_1354"></span>[1355](#fn_1354.md) The previous two
evangelists have not recorded these words, although they do mention the
fact that these parties accused Him. Luke is thus the one who has
specified the terms of the false accusations which were brought against
Him. On the other hand, he does not state that Pilate said to Him,
“Answerest thou nothing? behold, how many things they witness against
thee.” Instead of introducing these sentences, Luke goes on to relate
other matters which are also reported by these two. Thus he continues:
“And Pilate asked Him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And He
answered him and said, Thou sayest.” Matthew and Mark have likewise
inserted this fact, previous to the statement that Jesus was taken to
task for not answering His accusers. The truth, however, is not at all
affected by the order in which Luke has narrated these things; and as
little is it affected by the mere circumstance that one writer passes
over some incident without notice, which another expressly specifies. We
have an instance in what follows; namely, “Then said Pilate to the chief
priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man. And they were
the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout
all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. But when Pilate heard
of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean. And as soon as he
knew that He belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod,
who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. And when Herod saw
Jesus, he was exceeding glad; for he was desirous to see Him of a long
season, because he had heard many things of Him, and he hoped to see
some miracle done by Him. Then he questioned with Him in many words; but
He answered him nothing. And the chief priests and scribes stood and
vehemently accused Him. And Herod with his men of war set Him at nought,
and mocked Him, and arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him again
to Pilate. And the same day Herod and Pilate were made friends together:
for before they were at enmity between themselves.” <span
id="fr_1355"></span>[1356](#fn_1355.md) All these things are related by
Luke alone, namely, the fact that the Lord was sent by Pilate to Herod,
and the account of what took place on that occasion. At the same time,
among the statements which he makes in this passage, there are some
bearing a resemblance to matters which may be found reported by the
other evangelists in connection with different portions of their
narrations. But the immediate object of these others, however, was to
recount simply the various things which were done in Pilate’s presence
on to the time when the Lord was delivered over to be crucified. <span
id="page_194">p. 194</span> <span id="vi.vi.ix-Page_194"></span>In
accordance with his own plan, however, Luke makes the above digression
with the view of telling what occurred with Herod; and after that he
reverts to the history of what took place in the governor’s presence.
Thus he now continues as follows: “And Pilate, when he had called
together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, said unto
them, Ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the
people: and, behold, I having examined him before you, have found no
fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him.” <span
id="fr_1356"></span>[1357](#fn_1356.md) Here we notice that he has omitted
to mention how Pilate asked the Lord what answer He had to make to His
accusers. Thereafter he proceeds in these terms: “No, nor yet Herod: for
I sent you to him: and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. I
will therefore chastise him and release him. For of necessity he must
release one unto them at the feast. And they cried out all at once,
saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas; who for a
certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.
Pilate, therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. But
they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. And he said unto them the
third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death
in him: I will therefore chastise him and let him go. And they were
instant with loud voices, requiring that He might be crucified; and the
voices of them <span id="fr_1357"></span>[1358](#fn_1357.md)
prevailed.” <span id="fr_1358"></span>[1359](#fn_1358.md) The repeated
effort which Pilate, in his desire to accomplish the release of Jesus,
thus made to gain the people’s consent, is satisfactorily attested by
Matthew, although in a very few words, when he says, “But when Pilate
saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made.”
For he would not have made such a statement at all, had not Pilate
exerted himself earnestly in that direction, although at the same time
he has not told us how often he made such attempts to rescue Jesus from
their fury. Accordingly, Luke concludes his report of what took place in
the governor’s presence in this fashion: “And Pilate gave sentence that
it should be as they required. And he released unto them him that for
sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they desired; but he
delivered Jesus to their will.” <span
id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359.md)

<span id="vi.vi.ix-p17"></span>35. Let us next take the account of these
same incidents—that is to say, those in which Pilate was engaged—as it
is presented by John. He proceeds thus: “And they themselves went not
into the judgment-hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might
eat the passover. Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What
accusation bring ye against this man? They answered and said unto him,
If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto
thee.”  <span id="fr_1360"></span>[1361](#fn_1360.md) We must look into
this passage in order to show that it contains nothing inconsistent with
Luke’s version, which states that certain charges were brought against
Him, and also specifies their terms. For Luke’s words are these: “And
they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the
nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself
is Christ a king.” On the other hand, according to the paragraph which I
have now cited from John, the Jews seem to have been unwilling to state
any specific accusations, when Pilate asked them, “What accusation bring
ye against this man?” For their reply was, “If he were not a malefactor,
we would not have delivered him up unto thee;” the purport of which was,
that he should accept their authority, cease to inquire what fault was
alleged against Him, and believe Him guilty for the simple reason that
He had been \[reckoned\] worthy of being delivered up by them to him.
This being the case, then, we ought to suppose that both these versions
report words which were actually said, both the one before us at
present, and the one given by Luke. For among the multitude of sayings
and replies which passed between the parties, these writers have made
their own selections as far as their judgment allowed them to go, and
each of them has introduced into his narrative just what he considered
sufficient. It is also true that John himself mentions certain charges
which were alleged against Him, and which we shall find in their proper
connections. Here, then, he proceeds thus: “Then said Pilate unto them,
Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews, therefore,
said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death; that the
saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which He spake, signifying what
death He should die. Then Pilate entered into the judgment-hall again,
and called Jesus, and said unto Him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And
Jesus answered, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it
thee of me?” <span id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361.md) This again may
seem not to harmonize with what is recorded by the others,—namely,
“Jesus answered, Thou sayest,”—unless it is made clear in what follows
that the one thing was said as well as the other. Hence he gives us to
understand that the matters which he records next are \[not to be
regarded as\] things never actually uttered by the Lord, but are rather
to be considered things which have been passed <span id="page_195">p.
195</span> <span id="vi.vi.ix-Page_195"></span>over in silence by the
other evangelists. Mark, therefore, what remains of his narrative. It
proceeds thus: “Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation, and the
chief priests, have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? Jesus
answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this
world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to
the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence. Pilate therefore said
unto Him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a
king.”  <span id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362.md) Behold, here is the
point at which he comes to that which the other evangelists have
reported. And then he goes on, the Lord being still the speaker, to
recite other matters which the rest have not recorded. His terms are
these: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the
world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of
the truth heareth my voice. Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And
when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto
them, I find no fault in him. But ye have a custom, that I should
release unto you one at the passover: will ye, therefore, that I release
unto you the King of the Jews? Then cried they all again, Not this man,
but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. Then Pilate, therefore, took
Jesus, and scourged Him. And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and
put it on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe; and they came to
Him and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote Him with their
hands. Pilate went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him
forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. Then came
Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate
saith unto them, Behold the man! When the chief priests therefore and
officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.
Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him; for I find no
fault in him. The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he
ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.” <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363.md) This may fit in with what Luke
reports to have been stated in the accusation brought by the
Jews,—namely, “We found this fellow perverting our nation,”—so that we
might append here the reason given for it, “Because he made himself the
Son of God.” John then goes on in the following strain: “When Pilate,
therefore, heard that saying, he was the more afraid, and went again
into the judgment-hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus
gave him no answer. Then saith Pilate unto Him, Speakest thou not unto
me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power
to release thee? Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all
against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that
delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. From thenceforth Pilate
sought to release Him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this
man go, thou art not Cæsar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king,
speaketh against Cæsar.”  <span id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364.md)
This may very well agree with what Luke records in connection with the
said accusation brought by the Jews. For after the words, “We found this
fellow perverting our nation,” he has added the clause, “And forbidding
to give tribute to Cæsar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.”
This will also offer a solution for the difficulty previously referred
to, namely, the occasion which might seem to be given for supposing John
to have indicated that no specific charge was laid by the Jews against
the Lord, when they answered and said unto him, “If he were not a
malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.” John then
continues in the following strain: “When Pilate therefore heard that
saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment-seat, in a
place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. And it
was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour; and he
saith unto the Jews, Behold your King? But they cried out, Away with
him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your king? The
chief priests answered, We have no king but Cæsar. Then delivered he Him
therefore unto them to be crucified.” <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365.md) The above is John’s version of what
was done by Pilate. <span id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366.md)
