<span id="vi.v.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—An Explanation of the Circumstance
That, According to the Evangelist John, John the Baptist Says, “I Knew
Him Not;” While, According to the Others, It is Found that He Did
Already Know Him.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xvi-p2"></span>32. Again, the account of the dove given
in the Gospel according to John does not mention the time at which the
incident happened, but contains a statement of the words of John the
Baptist as reporting what he saw. In this section, the question rises as
to how it is said, “And I knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize
with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit
descending and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the
Holy Spirit.” <span id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811) For if he came to
know Him only at the time when he saw the dove descending upon Him, the
inquiry is raised as to how he could have said to Him, as He came to be
baptized, “I ought rather to be baptized of Thee.” <span
id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812) For the Baptist addressed Him thus
before the dove descended. From this, however, it is evident that,
although he did know Him \[in a certain sense\] before this time,—for he
even leaped in his mother’s womb when Mary visited Elisabeth, <span
id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813) —there was yet something which was not
known to him up to this time, and which he learned by the descending of
the dove,—namely, the fact that He baptized in the Holy Spirit by a
certain divine power proper to Himself; so that no man who received this
baptism from God, even although he baptized some, should be able to say
that that which he imparted was his own, or that the Holy Spirit was
given by him.
