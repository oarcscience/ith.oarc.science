<span id="v.ii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.</span>

<span id="v.ii.v-p2"></span>13. “Blessed are ye,” says He, “when men
shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil
against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad: for
great <span id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) is your reward in heaven.”
Let any one who is seeking after the delights of this world and the
riches of temporal things under the Christian name, consider that our
blessedness is within; as it is said of the soul of the Church <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) by the mouth of the prophet, “All the
beauty of the king’s daughter is within;” <span
id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) for outwardly revilings, and
persecutions, and disparagements are promised; and yet, from these
things there is a great reward in heaven, which is felt in the heart of
those who endure, those who can now say, “We glory in tribulations:
knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and
experience, hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God
is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.”
 <span id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) For it is not simply the enduring
of such things that is advantageous, but the bearing of such things for
the name of Christ not only with tranquil mind, but even with
exultation. For many heretics, deceiving souls under the Christian name,
endure many such things; but they are excluded from that reward on this
account, that it is not said merely, “Blessed are they which endure
persecution;” but it is added, “for righteousness’ sake.” Now, where
there is no sound faith, there can be no righteousness, for the just
\[righteous\] man lives by faith. <span id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md)
Neither let schismatics promise themselves anything of that reward; for
similarly, <span id="page_8">p. 8</span> <span
id="v.ii.v-Page_8"></span>where there is no love, there cannot be
righteousness, for “love worketh no ill to his neighbour;” <span
id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) and if they had it, they would not tear
in pieces Christ’s body, which is the Church. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md)

<span id="v.ii.v-p10"></span>14. But it may be asked, What is the
difference when He says, “when men shall revile you,” and “when they
shall say all manner of evil against you,” since to revile <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) is just this, to say evil against? <span
id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) But it is one thing when the reviling
word is hurled with contumely in presence of him who is reviled, as it
was said to our Lord, “Say we not the truth <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a
devil?” <span id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) and another thing, when our
reputation is injured in our absence, as it is also written of Him,
“Some said, He is a prophet; <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) others
said, Nay, but He deceiveth the people.” <span
id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) Then, further, to persecute is to inflict
violence, or to assail with snares, as was done by him who betrayed Him,
and by them who crucified Him. Certainly, as for the fact that this also
is not put in a bare form, so that it should be said, “and shall say all
manner of evil against you,” but there is added the word “falsely,” and
also the expression “for my sake;” I think that the addition is made for
the sake of those who wish to glory in persecutions, and in the baseness
of their reputation; and to say that Christ belongs to them for this
reason, that many bad things are said about them; while, on the one
hand, the things said are true, when they are said respecting their
error; and, on the other hand, if sometimes also some false charges are
thrown out, which frequently happens from the rashness of men, yet they
do not suffer such things for Christ’s sake. <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) For he is not a follower of Christ who is
not called a Christian according to the true faith and the catholic
discipline.

<span id="v.ii.v-p18"></span>15. “Rejoice,” says He, “and be exceeding
glad: for great is your reward in heaven.” I do not think that it is the
higher parts of this visible world that are here called heaven. For our
reward, which ought to be immoveable and eternal, is not to be placed in
things fleeting and temporal. But I think the expression “in heaven”
means in the spiritual firmament, where dwells everlasting
righteousness: in comparison with which a wicked soul is called earth,
to which it is said when it sins, “Earth thou art, and unto earth thou
shalt return.” <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) Of this heaven the
apostle says, “For our conversation is in heaven.” <span
id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) Hence they who rejoice in spiritual good
are conscious of that reward now; but then it will be perfected in every
part, when this mortal also shall have put on immortality. “For,” says
He, “so persecuted they the prophets also which were before you.” In the
present case He has used “persecution” in a general sense, as applying
alike to abusive words and to the tearing in pieces of one’s reputation;
and has well encouraged them by an example, because they who speak true
things are wont to suffer persecution: nevertheless did not the ancient
prophets on this account, through fear of persecution, give over the
preaching of the truth.

full of martyrs, every chain drag them, every one beheaded with the
sword be crowned. They who suffer for righteousness’ sake, suffer for
Christ’s sake.
