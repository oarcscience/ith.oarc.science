<span id="vii.xcii-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.xcii-p1.1"></span>Sermon XC.</span>

<span id="vii.xcii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.xcii-p2.1"></span>\[CXL. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.xcii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xcii-p3.1"></span>*[John xii.
44](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#044.md)<span id="vii.xcii-p3.2"></span>,
“He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.”
Against a certain expression of Maximinus, a bishop of the Arians, who
spread his blasphemy in Africa where he was with the Count Segisvult.*

<span id="vii.xcii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xcii-p4.1"></span>What</span> is it, Brethren, which we have
heard the Lord saying, “He that believeth on Me, believeth not on Me,
but on Him that sent Me”? <span id="fr_4173"></span>[4174](#fn_4173.md) It
is good for us to believe on Christ, especially seeing that He hath also
Himself expressly said this which ye have now heard, that is, that “He
had come a Light into the world, and whosoever believeth on Him shall
not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” <span
id="fr_4174"></span>[4175](#fn_4174.md) Good then it is to believe on
Christ; and a great evil it is not to believe on Christ. But because
Christ the Son is, Whatsoever He is, of the Father, but the Father is
not of the Son, but is the Father of the Son; He recommends to us indeed
faith in Himself, but refers the honour to His Original. <span
id="fr_4175"></span>[4176](#fn_4175.md)

<span id="vii.xcii-p8"></span>2. For hold this fast as a firm and
settled truth, if ye would continue Catholics, that God the Father begat
God the Son without time, and made Him of a Virgin in time. The first
nativity exceedeth times; the second nativity enlighteneth times. Yet
both nativities are marvellous; the one without a mother, the other
without a father. When God begat the Son, He begat Him of Himself, not
of a mother; when the Mother gave birth to her Son, she gave Him birth
as a Virgin, not by man. He was born of the Father without a beginning;
He was born of a mother, as to-day <span
id="fr_4176"></span>[4177](#fn_4176.md) at an appointed beginning. Born of
the Father He made us; born of a mother He re-made us. He was born of
the Father, that we might be; He was born of a mother, that we might not
be lost. But the Father begat Him equal to Himself, and All Whatsoever
the Son is, He hath of the Father. But What God the Father is, He hath
not of the Son. Accordingly we say that the Father is God, of none; the
Son, God of God. Wherefore all that the Son doeth marvellously, all that
He saith truly, He attributeth to Him of whom He is; yet can He not be
ought else than He of whom He is. Adam was made a man; he had power to
become something other than he was made. For he was made righteous, and
he had power to become unrighteous. But the Only-Begotten Son of God,
What He is, This cannot be changed; He cannot be changed into anything
else, cannot be diminished, What He was He cannot but be, He cannot but
be equal to the Father. But undoubtedly He who gave all things to the
Son by His Birth, gave it to One not needing ought; without doubt this
very equality too with the Father, the Father gave to the Son. How did
the Father give It? did He beget Him less, and add to Him to complete
His Form, that He might make Him equal? If he had done this, He would
have given it to one in need. But I have told you already what ye ought
most firmly to hold fast, that is, that All That the Son is, the Father
gave Him, gave Him, that is, by His Birth, not as in need of ought. If
He gave it to Him by His Birth, and not as in need, then doubtless He
both gave Him equality, and in giving Him equality, begat Him equal. And
although the One be One Person, and the Other Another; yet is not the
One one thing, and the Other another; but What the One is, That the
Other also. He who is the One, is not the Other; but What the One, That
too the Other.

<span id="vii.xcii-p10"></span>3. “He Who sent Me,” saith He, ye have
heard it; “He Who sent Me,” saith He, “He gave Me a commandment what I
should say, and what I should speak; and I know that His commandment is
life everlasting.” <span id="fr_4177"></span>[4178](#fn_4177.md) It is
John’s Gospel, hold it fast. “He Who sent Me, He gave Me a commandment
what I should say, and what I should speak; and I know that His
commandment is life everlasting.” O that He would grant me to say what I
wish! For my poverty and His abundance straiteneth me. “He,” saith He,
“gave Me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak; and
I know that His commandment is life everlast<span id="page_530">p.
530</span> <span id="vii.xcii-Page_530"></span>ing.” Search in the
Epistle of this John the Evangelist for what he hath said of Christ.
“Let us believe,” he says, “His True Son Jesus Christ. This is the True
God and Everlasting Life.” <span id="fr_4178"></span>[4179](#fn_4178.md)
What is, “The True God, and Everlasting Life”? The True Son of God is
the “the True God, and Everlasting Life.” Why did He say, “On His True
Son”? Because God hath many sons, therefore was He to be distinguished,
by adding that He was the True Son. Not by simply saying that He is the
Son; but by adding, as I have said, that He is the True Son; therefore
He was to be distinguished, because of the many sons which God hath. For
we are sons by grace, He by Nature. We made by the Father through Him;
He Himself That Which the Father is; are we too That Which God is?

<span id="vii.xcii-p13"></span>4. But some man coming across us, knowing
not what he is saying, says, “For this reason was it said, “I and My
Father are One; <span id="fr_4179"></span>[4180](#fn_4179.md) for that They
have with One Another an agreement of will, not because the Nature of
the Son is the Very Same as the Nature of the Father. For the Apostles
too (now this is what he said, <span
id="fr_4180"></span>[4181](#fn_4180) not I.md), for the Apostles too are
one with the Father and the Son.” Horrible blasphemy! “And the
Apostles,” says he, “are one with the Father and the Son, in that they
obey the will of the Father and the Son.” Has he dared to say this? Let
Paul then say, “I and God are one.” Let Peter say it, let every one of
the Prophets say, “I and God are one.” They do not say it; God forbid
they should. They know that they are a different nature, a nature that
needeth to be saved; they know that they are a different nature, a
nature that needeth to be enlightened. No one says, “I and God are one.”
Whatsoever progress he may make, howsoever he may surpass others in
holiness, with how great eminence soever of virtue he may excel, he
never saith, “I and God are one;” for if he have excellence, and
therefore saith it; by saying it, he loseth what he had.

<span id="vii.xcii-p16"></span>5. Believe then that the Son is equal
with the Father; but yet that the Son is of the Father; but the Father
not of the Son. The Original is with the Father, equality with the Son.
For if He be not equal, He is not a true Son. For what are we saying,
Brethren? If He is not equal, He is less; if He is less, I ask the
nature that needeth to be saved, in its misbelief, “how is He born
less?” Answer, Doth He as being less grow or not? If He groweth, then
the Father groweth old. But if He will ever be what He was born; if He
was born less, He will continue less; with this His loss He will be
perfect; born perfect with this loss of the Father’s Form, He is never
to attain to the Father’s Form. Thus do ye ungodly assail <span
id="fr_4181"></span>[4182](#fn_4181.md) the Son; thus do ye heretics
blaspheme the Son. What then saith the Catholic faith? The Son is God,
of God the Father; God the Father, not God of the Son. But God the Son
equal with the Father, Born equal; not Born less, not made equal, but
Born equal. What the Father is, That is He also who was born. Was the
Father ever without the Son? God forbid! Take away your “ever,” where
there is no time. The Father always, the Son always. The Father without
beginning of time, the Son without beginning of time; the Father never
before the Son, the Father never without the Son. But yet because the
Son is God of God the Father, and the Father God, but not of God the
Son; let not the honouring of the Son in the Father displease us. For
the honouring of the Son giveth honour to the Father, it diminisheth not
His Own Divinity.

<span id="vii.xcii-p18"></span>6. Because then I was speaking of what I
had brought forward, “And I knew,” saith He, “that His commandment is
everlasting life.” <span id="fr_4182"></span>[4183](#fn_4182.md) Mark,
Brethren, what I am saying; “I know that His commandment is everlasting
life.” And we read in the same John concerning Christ, “He is The True
God and Everlasting Life.” <span id="fr_4183"></span>[4184](#fn_4183.md) If
the Father’s commandment is “everlasting Life,” and Christ the Son
Himself is “everlasting Life;” the Son is Himself the Father’s
Commandment. For how is not That the Father’s Commandment, which is the
Father’s Word? Or if you take the commandment given to the Son by the
Father in a carnal sense, as if the Father said to the Son, “I command
Thee this, I wish Thee to do that;” in what words spake He to the Only
Word? When He gave commandment to the Word, did He look for words? That
the Father’s Commandment then is “Life everlasting,” and that the Son
Himself is “Life everlasting,” believe ye and receive, believe and
understand, for the Prophet saith, “Unless ye believe ye shall not
understand.” <span id="fr_4184"></span>[4185](#fn_4184.md) Do ye not
comprehend? Be enlarged. Hear the Apostle: “Be ye enlarged, bear not the
yoke with unbelievers.” <span id="fr_4185"></span>[4186](#fn_4185.md) They
who will not believe this before they comprehend, are unbelievers. And
because they have determined to be unbelievers, they will remain in
their ignorance. Let them believe then that they may understand. Most
certainly the Father’s Commandment is “everlasting Life.” Therefore the
Father’s Commandment is the Very Son who was born this day; a
Commandment not given in time but a Commandment Born. The Gospel of John
exercises our minds, refines  <span id="fr_4186"></span>[4187](#fn_4186.md)
and uncarnalizes them, that of God we may think not <span
id="page_531">p. 531</span> <span id="vii.xcii-Page_531"></span>after a
carnal but a spiritual manner. Let so much then, Brethren, suffice you;
lest in length of disputation, the sleep of forgetfulness steal over
you.
