<span id="vi.vi.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Of the Question Whether the
Evangelists are All at One on the Subject of the Narrative Regarding
Joseph, Who Begged the Lord’s Body from Pilate, and Whether John’s
Version Contains Any Statements at Variance with Each Other.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xxiii-p2"></span>59. Matthew proceeds as follows: “Now
when the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named
Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple: he went to Pilate, and
begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be
delivered.” <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) Mark presents it
in this form: “And now when the even was come, because it was the
preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, Joseph of Arimathea,
an honourable councillor, which also waited for the kingdom of God,
came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. And
Pilate marvelled if He were already dead: and, calling unto him the
centurion, he asked him whether He had been any while <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md) dead. And when he knew it of the
centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.” <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md) Luke’s report runs in these terms:
“And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a councillor; and he was a
good man, and a just (the same had not consented to the counsel and deed
of them): he was of Arimathea, a city of the Jews: who also himself
waited for the kingdom of God. This man went unto Pilate, and begged the
body of Jesus.” <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md) John, on the
other hand, first narrates the breaking of the legs of those who had
been crucified with the Lord, and the piercing of the Lord’s side with
the lance (which whole passage has been recorded by him alone), and then
subjoins a statement which is of the same tenor with what is given by
the other evangelists. It proceeds in these terms: “And after this,
Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of
the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and
Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of
Jesus.” <span id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465.md) There is nothing here
to give any one of them the appearance of being in antagonism with
another. But some one may perhaps ask whether John is not inconsistent
with himself, when he at once unites with the rest in telling us how
Joseph begged the body of Jesus, and comes forward as the only one who
states here that Joseph had been a disciple of Jesus secretly for fear
of the Jews. For the question may reasonably be raised as to how it
happened that the man who had been a disciple secretly for fear had the
courage to beg His body—a thing which not one of those who were His open
followers was bold enough to do. We must understand, however, that this
man did so in the confidence which his dignified position gave him, the
possession of which rendered it possible for him to make his way on
familiar terms into Pilate’s presence. And we must suppose, further,
that in the performance of that last service relating to the interment,
he cared less for the Jews, however he tried in ordinary circumstances,
when hearing the Lord, to avoid exposing himself to their enmity.
