<span id="vi.vi.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Of the Lord’s Successive
Utterances When He Was About to Die; And of the Question Whether Matthew
and Mark are in Harmony with Luke in Their Reports of These Sayings, and
Also Whether These Three Evangelists are in Harmony with John.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xix-p2"></span>55. Matthew proceeds as follows: “And
Jesus, crying again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.” <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) In like manner, Mark says, “And
Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.” <span
id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md) Luke, again, has told us what He
said when that loud voice was uttered. For his version is thus: “And
Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into Thy hands I commend
my spirit: and saying this, He gave up the ghost.” <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md) John, on the other hand, as he has
left unnoticed the first voice, which Matthew and Mark have
reported—namely, “Eli, Eli”—has also passed over in silence the one
which has been recited only by Luke, while the other two have referred
to it under the designation of the “loud voice.” I allude to the cry,
“Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.” Luke has also attested the
fact that this exclamation was uttered with a loud voice; and hence we
may understand this particular cry to be identified with the loud voice
which Matthew and Mark have specified. But John has stated a fact which
is noticed by none of the other three, namely, that He said “It is
finished,” after He had received the vinegar. This cry we take to have
been uttered previous to the loud voice referred to. For these are
John’s words: “When Jesus, therefore, had received the vinegar, He said,
It is finished; and He bowed His head, and gave up the ghost.”  <span
id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) In the interval elapsing between
this cry, “It is finished,” and what is referred to in the subsequent
sentence, “and He bowed His head and gave up the ghost,” the voice was
uttered which John himself has passed over without record, but which the
other three have noticed. For the precise succession appears to be this,
namely, that He said first “It is finished,” when what had been
prophesied regarding Him was fulfilled in Him, and that thereafter—as if
He had been waiting for this, like one, indeed, who died when He willed
it to be so—He commended His <span id="page_205">p. 205</span> <span
id="vi.vi.xix-Page_205"></span>spirit \[to His Father\], and resigned
it. <span id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) But, whatever the order
may be in which a person may consider it likely that these words were
spoken, he ought above all things to guard against entertaining the
notion that any one of the evangelists is in antagonism with another,
when one leaves unmentioned something which another has repeated, or
particularizes something which another has passed by in silence.
