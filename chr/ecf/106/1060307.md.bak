<span id="vii.xc-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xc-p3.1"></span>*[John x.
14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014.md)<span id="vii.xc-p3.2"></span>, “I
am the good shepherd,” etc. Against the Donatists.*

<span id="vii.xc-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xc-p4.1"></span>We</span> have heard the Lord Jesus setting
forth to us the office of a good shepherd. And herein He hath doubtless
given us to know, as we may understand it, that there are good
shepherds. And yet that the multitude of shepherds might not be
understood in a wrong sense; He saith, “I am the good Shepherd.” <span
id="fr_4123"></span>[4124](#fn_4123.md) And wherein He is the good
Shepherd, He showeth in the words following; “The good Shepherd,” saith
He, “layeth down His life for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and
not the shepherd, seeth the wolf coming, and fleeth; because he careth
not for the sheep, for he is an hireling.” <span
id="fr_4124"></span>[4125](#fn_4124.md) Christ then is the good Shepherd.
What was Peter? was he not a good shepherd? Did not he too lay down his
life for the sheep? What was Paul? what the rest of the Apostles? what
the blessed Bishops, Martyrs, who followed close upon their times? What
again our holy Cyprian? Were they not all good shepherds, not hirelings,
of whom it is said, “Verily I say unto you, they have received their
reward”? <span id="fr_4125"></span>[4126](#fn_4125.md) All these then were
good shepherds, not simply for that they shed their blood, but that they
shed it for the sheep. For not in pride, but in charity they shed it.

<span id="vii.xc-p8"></span>2. For even among the heretics, they who for
their iniquities and errors have suffered any trouble, vaunt themselves
in the name of martyrdom, that with this fair covering disguised <span
id="fr_4126"></span>[4127](#fn_4126.md) they may plunder the more easily,
for wolves they are. Now if ye would know in what rank they are to be
held, hear that good shepherd, the Apostle Paul, that not all who even
give up their bodies in suffering to the flames, are to be accounted to
have shed their blood for the sheep, but rather against the sheep. “If,”
saith he, “I speak with the tongues of men, and angels, but have not
charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. If I
should know all mysteries, and have all prophecy, and all faith, so that
I could remove mountains, but have not charity, I am nothing.” <span
id="fr_4127"></span>[4128](#fn_4127.md) Now a great thing truly is this
faith that removes mountains. They are indeed all great things; but if I
have them without charity, saith he, not they, but I am nothing. But up
to this point he hath not touched them, who glory in sufferings under
the false name of martyrdom. Hear how he toucheth, yea rather pierceth
them through and through. “If I should distribute,” saith he, “all my
goods to the poor, and deliver my body to be burned.” Now here they are.
But mark what follows; “but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.”
Lo, they have come to suffering, come even to the shedding of blood, yea
come to the burning of the body; and yet it profiteth them nothing,
because charity is lacking. Add charity, they all profit; take charity
away, all the rest profit nothing.

<span id="vii.xc-p11"></span>3. What a good is this charity, Brethren!
What more precious? what yieldeth greater light? or strength? or profit?
or security? Many are the gifts of God, which even the wicked have, who
shall say, “Lord, we have prophesied in Thy Name, in Thy Name have cast
out devils, in Thy Name done many mighty works.” <span
id="fr_4128"></span>[4129](#fn_4128.md) And He will not answer, “Ye have
not done them.” For in the Presence of so great a Judge, they will not
dare to lie or boast of things they have not done. But for that they had
not charity, He answereth them all, “I know you not.” Now how can he
have so much as the smallest charity, who when even <span
id="fr_4129"></span>[4130](#fn_4129.md) convicted, loves not unity? It was
then as impressing on good shepherds this unity, that our Lord was
unwilling to mention many shepherds. For it is not, as I have said
already, that Peter was not a good shepherd, and Paul, the rest of the
Apostles, and the holy Bishops who were after them, and blessed Cyprian.
All these were good shepherds; and notwithstanding to good shepherds, He
commended not good shepherds, but a good Shepherd. “I,” saith He, “am
the good Shepherd.”

<span id="vii.xc-p14"></span>4. Let us question the Lord with such
little understanding as we have, and in most humble discourse hold
converse with so great a Master. What sayest Thou, O Lord, Thou good
Shepherd? For Thou art the good Shepherd, who art also the good Lamb; at
once Pastor and Pasturage, at once Lamb and Lion. What sayest Thou? Let
us give ear and aid us, that we may understand. “I,” saith He, “am the
good Shepherd.” What is Peter? is he either not a shepherd, or a bad
one? Let us see, if he be not a shepherd. “Lovest thou Me?” <span
id="fr_4130"></span>[4131](#fn_4130.md) Thou saidst to Him Lord, “Lovest
thou Me?” And he answered, “I do love Thee.” And Thou to him, “Feed My
sheep.” Thou, Thou, Lord, <span id="page_524">p. 524</span> <span
id="vii.xc-Page_524"></span>by Thine Own questioning, by the strong
assurance of Thine Own words, madest of the lover a shepherd. He is a
shepherd then to whom Thou didst commit Thy sheep to be fed. Thou didst
Thyself entrust them, he is a shepherd. Let us now see whether he be not
a good one. This we find by the very question, and his answer. Thou
didst ask, whether he loved Thee; he answered, “I do love Thee.” Thou
sawest his heart, that he answered truth. Is he not then good, who
loveth so great a Good? Whence that answer drawn from his inmost heart?
Wherefore was this Peter, who had Thine eyes in his heart for witnesses,
sad because Thou askedst him not once only, but a second and a third
time, that by a threefold confession of love, he might efface the
threefold sin of denial; wherefore, I say, being sad that he was asked
repeatedly by Him who knew what He was asking, and had given what He
heard; wherefore being sad, did he return such an answer, “Lord, Thou
knowest all things, Thyself knowest that I love Thee”? What! in making
such a confession, such a profession rather, would he lie? In truth
then, he made answer of his love to Thee, and from his inmost heart he
gave utterance to a lover’s words. Now Thou hast said, “A good man out
of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things.”  <span
id="fr_4131"></span>[4132](#fn_4131.md) So then he is both a shepherd, and
a good shepherd; nothing it is true to the power and goodness of the
Shepherd of shepherds; but nevertheless even he is both a shepherd, and
a good one; and all other such are good shepherds.

<span id="vii.xc-p17"></span>5. What means it then, that to good
shepherds Thou dost set forth One Only Shepherd, but that in One
Shepherd Thou teachest unity? and the Lord Himself explains this more
clearly by my ministry, putting you, beloved, in remembrance by this
Gospel, and saying, “Hear ye what I have set forth; I have said, ‘I am
the good Shepherd;’ because all the rest, all the good shepherds, are My
members.” One Head, One Body, One Christ. So then both the Shepherd of
shepherds, and the shepherds of the Shepherd, and the sheep with their
shepherds under The Shepherd. What is all this, but what the Apostle
says? “For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.” <span
id="fr_4132"></span>[4133](#fn_4132.md) Therefore if Christ be even so,
with good reason doth Christ in Himself containing all good shepherds,
set forth One, saying, “‘I am the good Shepherd.’ ‘I am,’ I Alone am,
all the rest with Me are one in unity. Whoso feedeth without Me, feedeth
against Me. ‘He that gathereth not with Me, scattereth.’” <span
id="fr_4133"></span>[4134](#fn_4133.md) Hear then this unity more forcibly
set forth; “Other sheep,” saith He, “I have which are not of this
fold.” <span id="fr_4134"></span>[4135](#fn_4134.md) For He was speaking to
the first fold of the stock of the fleshly Israel. But there were others
of the stock of the faith of this Israel, and they were yet without,
were among the Gentiles, predestinated, not yet gathered in. These He
knew who had predestinated them; He knew, who had come to redeem them
with the shedding of His Own Blood. He saw them who did not yet see Him;
He knew them who yet believed not on Him. “Other sheep,” saith He, “I
have which are not of this fold;” because they are not of the stock of
the flesh of Israel. But nevertheless they shall not be outside of this
fold, “for them also I must bring, that there may be One Fold, and One
Shepherd.”

<span id="vii.xc-p21"></span>6. With good reason then to This Shepherd
of shepherds, doth His Beloved, His Spouse, His Fair One, but by Him
made fair, before by sin deformed, beautiful afterward through pardon
and grace, speak in her love and ardour after Him, and say to Him,
“Where feedest Thou?” <span id="fr_4135"></span>[4136](#fn_4135.md) And
observe how, by what transport this spiritual love is here animated. And
far better are they by this transport delighted, who have tasted ought
of the sweetness of this love. They hear this properly, who love Christ.
For in them, and of them, doth the Church sing this in the Song of
Songs; who love Christ, as it seemed without beauty, yet the Only
Beautiful One. “For we saw Him,” it is said, “and He had neither beauty
nor comeliness.” <span id="fr_4136"></span>[4137](#fn_4136.md) Such He
appeared on the Cross, such when crowned with thorns did He exhibit
Himself, disfigured, and without comeliness, as if He had lost His
power, as if not the Son of God. Such seemed He to the blind. For it is
in the person of the Jews that Isaiah said this, “We saw Him, and He had
no beauty nor comeliness.” When it was said, “If He be the Son of God,
let Him come down from the Cross. He saved others, Himself He cannot
save.” <span id="fr_4137"></span>[4138](#fn_4137.md) And smiting Him on the
head with a reed, they said, “Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, who smote
Thee?” <span id="fr_4138"></span>[4139](#fn_4138.md) Because “He had
neither beauty nor comeliness.” As such did ye Jews see Him. For
“blindness hath happened in part to Israel, until the fulness of the
Gentiles enter in,” <span id="fr_4139"></span>[4140](#fn_4139.md) until the
other sheep come. Because then blindness hath happened, therefore did ye
see the Comely One without comeliness. “For had ye known Him, ye would
never have crucified the Lord of Glory.” <span
id="fr_4140"></span>[4141](#fn_4140.md) But ye did it, because ye knew Him
not. And yet He who as though without beauty bare with you, all
Beauteous as He was, prayed for you; “Father,” saith He, “forgive them,
for they know not what they do.” <span
id="fr_4141"></span>[4142](#fn_4141.md) For if He were without comeliness,
how is it that <span id="page_525">p. 525</span> <span
id="vii.xc-Page_525"></span>she loveth Him, who saith, “Tell me, O Thou
whom my soul loveth”? <span id="fr_4142"></span>[4143](#fn_4142.md) How is
it that she loveth Him? how is it that she burneth for Him? how is it
that she feareth so much to stray from Him? How is it that she hath so
great delight in Him, that her only punishment is to be without Him?
What would there be for which He should be loved, if He were not
beautiful? But how could she love Him so, if He appeared to her as He
did to those blind men persecuting Him, and knowing not what they do? As
what then did she love Him? As “comely in form above the sons of men.
Comely in form above the sons of men, grace is poured abroad in Thy
Lips.” <span id="fr_4143"></span>[4144](#fn_4143.md) So then from these Thy
Lips, “Tell me, O Thou whom my soul loveth. Tell me,” says she, “O Thou
whom,” not my flesh, but, “my soul loveth. Tell me where Thou feedest,
where Thou liest down in the midday; lest haply I light, as one veiled,
upon the flocks of Thy companions.” <span
id="fr_4144"></span>[4145](#fn_4144.md)

<span id="vii.xc-p32"></span>7. It seems obscure, obscure it is; for it
is a mystery of the sacred marriage bed. For she says, “The King hath
brought me into His chamber.” <span id="fr_4145"></span>[4146](#fn_4145.md)
Of such a chamber is this a mystery. But ye who are not as profane kept
off from this chamber, hear ye what ye are, and say with her, if with
her ye love (and ye do love with her, if ye are in her); say all, and
yet let one say, for unity saith; “Tell me, O Thou whom my soul loveth.
For they had one soul to Godward, and one heart. <span
id="fr_4146"></span>[4147](#fn_4146.md) Tell me where Thou feedest, where
Thou liest down in the midday?” What does the midday <span
id="fr_4147"></span>[4148](#fn_4147.md) signify? “Great heat, and great
brightness.” So then, “make known to me who are Thy wise ones,” fervent
in spirit, and brilliant in doctrine. “Make known to me Thy Right Hand,
and men learned in heart, in wisdom.” <span
id="fr_4148"></span>[4149](#fn_4148.md) To them may I cleave in Thy Body,
to them be united, with them enjoy Thee. Tell me then, “tell me, where
Thou feedest, where Thou liest down in the midday;” lest I fall upon
them who say other things of Thee, entertain other sentiments of Thee;
believe other things of Thee, preach other things of Thee; and have
their own flocks, and are Thy companions; for that they live of Thy
table, and handle the sacraments of Thy table. For companions are so
called, because they eat together, <span
id="fr_4149"></span>[4150](#fn_4149.md) messmates as it were. Such are
reproved in the Psalm; “For if Mine enemy had spoken great things
against Me, I would surely have hidden Myself from him; and if he that
hated Me had spoken great things against Me, I would surely have hidden
Myself from him; but thou a man of one mind with Me, My guide, and My
familiar, who didst take sweet meats together with Me, in the house of
God we walked with consent.” <span id="fr_4150"></span>[4151](#fn_4150.md)
Why then now against the house of the Lord with dissent, but that “they
have gone out from us, but they were not of us?” <span
id="fr_4151"></span>[4152](#fn_4151.md) Therefore, “O Thou whom my soul
loveth,” that I may not fall upon such, Thy companions, but companions
such as Samson’s were, who kept not faith with their friend, but wished
to corrupt his wife. <span id="fr_4152"></span>[4153](#fn_4152.md)
Therefore, that I may not fall upon such as these, “that I may not light
upon them,” that is, fall upon them, “as one that is veiled,” as one
that is concealed, that is, and obscure, not as established upon the
mountain. “Tell me” then, “O thou whom my soul loveth, where Thou
feedest, where Thou liest down in the midday;” who are the wise and
faithful in whom Thou dost specially rest, lest by chance as in
blindness I fall upon the flocks, not Thy flocks, but the flocks of Thy
companions. For thou didst not say to Peter, “Feed thy sheep,” but,
“Feed My sheep.” <span id="fr_4153"></span>[4154](#fn_4153.md)

<span id="vii.xc-p42"></span>8. Let then the “good Shepherd,” and, “the
Comely in form above the sons of men,” make answer to this beloved one;
make answer to her whom He hath made beautiful from among the children
of men. Hear ye what He answereth, and understand, beware of that
wherewith He alarmeth, love that which He adviseth. What then doth He
answer? How free from soft caresses, yea, to her caresses He returneth
severity! He is sharp that He may bind her closely, that He may keep
her. “If thou know not thyself,” saith He, “O thou fair one among
women:” <span id="fr_4154"></span>[4155](#fn_4154.md) for however fair
others may be by the gifts of thy Spouse, they are heresies, fair in
outward ornament, not within: <span id="fr_4155"></span>[4156](#fn_4155.md)
fair are they without, and outwardly they shine, they disguise
themselves by the name of righteousness; “but all the beauty of the
King’s daughter is within.” <span id="fr_4156"></span>[4157](#fn_4156.md)
“If” then “thou know not thyself;” that thou art one, that thou art
throughout all nations, that thou art chaste, that thou oughtest not to
corrupt thyself with the disordered converse of evil companions. “If
thou know not thyself,” that in uprightness, “he hath espoused thee to
Me, to present you a chaste Virgin to Christ;” <span
id="fr_4157"></span>[4158](#fn_4157.md) and that in uprightness thou
shouldest present thine own self to Me, lest by evil converse, “as the
serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds too should be
corrupted from my purity.” <span id="fr_4158"></span>[4159](#fn_4158.md)
“If,” I say, “thou know not thyself” to be such, “go thy way; go thy
way.” For to others I shall say, “Enter thou into the joy of <span
id="page_526">p. 526</span> <span id="vii.xc-Page_526"></span>thy
Lord.” <span id="fr_4159"></span>[4160](#fn_4159.md) To thee I shall not
say, “Enter in;” but, “Go thy way;” that thou mayest be among those, who
“went out from us.” “Go thy way.” That is, “if thou know not thyself,”
then, “go thy way.” But if thou know thyself, enter in. But, “if thou
know not thyself, go thy way by the footsteps of the flocks, and feed
thy kids in the tents of the shepherds. Go thy way by the footsteps,”
not “of the Flock,” but, “of the flocks, and feed,” not as Peter, “My
sheep,” but, “thy kids; in the tents,” not “of the Shepherd,” but, “of
the shepherds;” not of unity, but of dissension; not established there,
where there is One flock and One Shepherd. The beloved one was
confirmed, edified, made stronger, prepared to die for her Spouse and to
live with her Spouse.

<span id="vii.xc-p49"></span>9. These words which I have quoted out of
the Holy Song of Songs, of a kind of bridal song of the Bridegroom and
the Bride (for it is a spiritual wedding, wherein we must live in great
purity, for Christ hath granted to the Church in spirit that which His
Mother had in body, to be at once a Mother and a Virgin); these words, I
say, the Donatists accommodate to their own perverted sense in a very
different meaning. And how I will not conceal from you, and what ye may
answer them, I will, by the Lord’s help, as well as I shall be able,
briefly recommend. When then we begin to press them with the light of
the Church’s unity spread over the whole world, and demand of them to
show us any testimony out of the Scriptures, where God hath foretold
that the Church should be in Africa, as if all the rest of the nations
were lost; they are in the habit of taking this testimony in their
mouths, and saying; “Africa is under the midday sun; the Church then”
they say, “asking the Lord where He feedeth, where He lieth down; He
answereth, ‘Under the midday sun;’” as if the voice of her who put the
question, were, “Tell me, O Thou whom my soul loveth, where Thou
feedest, where Thou liest down;” and the Voice of Him who answereth,
were, “Under the midday sun;” that is, in Africa. If then it be the
Church which asketh, and the Lord maketh answer where he feedeth, in
Africa, because the Church was in Africa; then she who asketh was not in
Africa. “Tell me,” she saith, “O Thou whom my soul loveth, where Thou
feedest, where Thou liest down;” and He maketh answer to some Church out
of Africa, “Under the midday sun,” in Africa I lie down, in Africa I
feed, as if it were, “I do not feed in thee.” I repeat, if she who
asketh is the Church, which no one disputes, which not even themselves
gainsay; and they hear something about Africa; then she who asketh is
out of Africa; and because it is the Church, the Church is out of
Africa.

<span id="vii.xc-p50"></span>10. But see, I admit that Africa is under
the midday sun; although Egypt is rather under the meridian, under the
midday sun than Africa. Now after what fashion This Shepherd is there in
Egypt, they who know, will acknowledge; and for them that know not, let
them enquire how large a flock lie gathereth there, how great a
multitude He hath of holy men and women who utterly despise the world.
That flock hath so increased, that it hath expelled superstitions even
thence. To pass over how it hath in its increase banished thence the
whole superstition of idols, which had been firmly fixed there; I admit
what you say, O evil companions; I admit it altogether, I agree that
Africa is in the South, and that Africa is signified in that which is
said, “Where feedest Thou, where dost Thou lie down under the midday
sun?” But do ye too equally observe how that up to this point these are
the words of the Bride, and not yet of the Bridegroom. Hitherto it is
the Bride that saith, “Tell me, O Thou whom my soul loveth, where Thou
feedest, where Thou dost lie down in the midday, lest by chance I light,
as one veiled.” O thou deaf, and blind one, if in the “midday” thou
seest Africa, why in her that is “veiled” dost thou not see the Bride?
“Tell me,” she said, “O Thou whom my soul loveth.” Without doubt she
addresses her Spouse, when she says, “whom” \[in the masculine <span
id="fr_4160"></span>[4161](#fn_4160.md) \] “my soul loveth.” Just as if it
were said, “Tell me, O thou whom \[in the feminine <span
id="fr_4161"></span>[4162](#fn_4161.md) \] “my soul loveth;” we should
understand that the Bridegroom spake these words to His Bride; so when
you hear, “Tell me, O thou whom” (in the masculine) “my soul loveth,
where Thou feedest, where Thou liest down;” add to this, to her words
belongs also what follows, “In the midday.” I am asking, “where Thou
feedest in the midday, lest by chance I light as one veiled upon the
flocks of Thy companions.” I consent entirely, I admit what you
understand of Africa; it is signified by “the midday.” But then as you
understand it, the Church of Christ beyond the sea is addressing her
Spouse, in fear of falling into the African error, “O Thou whom my soul,
loveth, tell me,” teach me. For I hear that “in the midday,” that is in
Africa, there are two parties, yea rather many schisms. <span
id="fr_4162"></span>[4163](#fn_4162.md) “Tell me,” then, “where Thou
feedest,” what sheep belong to Thee, what fold Thou biddest me love
there, whereunto ought I to unite myself. “Lest by chance I light as one
veiled.” For they mock me as if I were concealed, they mock me as
destroyed, as though I existed nowhere else. “Lest,” then, “as one
veiled,” as if concealed, <span id="page_527">p. 527</span> <span
id="vii.xc-Page_527"></span>“I light upon the flocks,” that is, upon the
congregarious of the heretics, “thy companions; the Donatists, the
Maximinianists, the Rogatists and all the other pests who gather
without, and who therefore scatter; “Tell me,” I pray Thee, if I must
seek my Shepherd there, that I fall not into the gulf of re-baptizing. I
exhort you, I beseech you by the sanctity of such nuptials, love this
Church, be ye in this holy Church, be ye this Church; love the good
Shepherd, the Spouse so fair, who deceiveth no one, who desireth no one
to perish. Pray too for the scattered sheep; that they too may come,
that they too may acknowledge Him, that they too may love Him; that
there may be One Flock and One Shepherd. Let us turn to the Lord, etc.
