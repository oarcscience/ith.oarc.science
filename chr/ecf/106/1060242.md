<span id="vii.xxv-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xxv-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. xiii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019.md)<span id="vii.xxv-p3.2"></span>,
etc., where the Lord Jesus explaineth the parables of the sower.*

<span id="vii.xxv-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xxv-p4.1"></span>Both</span> yesterday and to-day ye have heard
the parables of the sower, in the words of our Lord Jesus Christ. Do ye
who were present yesterday, recollect to-day. Yesterday we read of that
sower, who when he scattered seed, “some fell by the way side,” <span
id="fr_2506"></span>[2507](#fn_2506.md) which the birds picked up; “some in
stony places,” which dried up from the heat; “some among thorns, which
were choked,” and could not bring forth fruit; and “other some into good
ground, and it brought forth fruit, a hundred, sixty, thirty fold.” But
to-day the Lord hath again spoken another parable of the sower, “who
sowed good seed in his field. While men slept the enemy came, and sowed
tares upon it.” <span id="fr_2507"></span>[2508](#fn_2507.md) As long as it
was only in the blade, it did not appear; but when the fruit of the good
seed began to appear, “then appeared the tares also.” The servants of
the householder were offended, when they saw a quantity of tares among
the good wheat, and wished to root them out, but they were not suffered
to do so; but it was said to them, “Let both grow together until the
harvest.” <span id="fr_2508"></span>[2509](#fn_2508.md) Now the Lord Jesus
Christ explained this parable also; and said that He was the sower of
the good seed, and He showed how that the enemy who sowed the tares was
the devil; the time of harvest, the end of the world; His field the
whole world. And what saith He? “In the time of harvest I will say to
the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, to burn them, but
gather the wheat into My barn.” Why are ye so hasty, He says, ye
servants full of zeal? Ye see tares among the wheat, ye see evil
Christians among the good; and ye wish to root up the evil ones; be
quiet, it is not the time of harvest. That time will come, may it only
find you wheat! Why do ye vex yourselves? Why bear impatiently the
mixture of the evil with the good? In the field they may be with you,
but they will not be so in the barn.

<span id="vii.xxv-p8"></span>2. Now ye know that those three places
mentioned yesterday where the seed did not grow, “the way side,” “the
stony ground,” and “the thorny places,” are the same as these “tares.”
They received only a different name under a different similitude. For
when similitudes are used, or the literal meaning of a term is not
expressed, not the truth but a similitude of the truth is conveyed by
them. I see that but few have understood my meaning; yet it is for the
benefit of all that I speak. In things visible, a way side is a way
side, stony ground is stony ground, thorny places are thorny places;
they are simply what they are, because the names are used in their
literal sense. But in parables and similitudes one thing may be called
by many names; therefore there is nothing inconsistent in my telling you
that that “way side,” that “stony ground,” those “thorny places,” are
bad Christians, and that they too are the “tares.” Is not Christ called
“the Lamb”? Is not Christ “the Lion” too? Among wild beasts, and cattle,
a lamb is simply a lamb, and a lion, a lion: but Christ is both. The
first are respectively what they are in propriety of expression; the
Latter both together in a figurative sense. <span
id="fr_2509"></span>[2510](#fn_2509.md) Nay much more; besides this it may
happen that under a figure, things very different from one another may
be called by one and the same name. For what is so different as Christ
and the devil? yet both Christ and the devil are called “a lion.” Christ
is called “a lion:” “The Lion hath prevailed of the tribe of
Judah;” <span id="fr_2510"></span>[2511](#fn_2510.md) and the devil is
called a lion: “Know ye not that your adversary the Devil walketh about
as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour?” <span
id="fr_2511"></span>[2512](#fn_2511.md) Both the one and the other then is
a lion; the one a lion by reason of His strength; the other for his
savageness; the one a lion for His “prevailing;” the other for his
injuring. The devil again is a serpent, “that old serpent;” <span
id="fr_2512"></span>[2513](#fn_2512.md) are we commanded then to imitate
the devil, when our Shepherd told us, “Be ye wise as serpents, and
simple as doves”? <span id="fr_2513"></span>[2514](#fn_2513.md)

<span id="vii.xxv-p14"></span>3. Accordingly I yesterday addressed “the
way side,” I addressed the “stony ground,” I addressed the “thorny
places;” and I said, Be ye changed whilst ye may: turn up with the
plough the hard ground, cast the stones out of the field, pluck up the
thorns out of it. Be loth to retain that hard heart, from which the word
of God may quickly pass away and be lost. Be loth to have that lightness
of soil, where the root of charity can take no deep hold. Be loth to
choke the good seed which is sown in you by my labours, with the lusts
and the cares of this world. For it is the Lord who sows; and we are
only His labourers. But be ye the “good <span id="page_335">p.
335</span> <span id="vii.xxv-Page_335"></span>ground.” I said yesterday,
and I say again today to all, Let one bring forth “a hundred, another
sixty, another thirty fold.” In one the fruit is more, in another less;
but all will have a place in the barn. Yesterday I said all this, to-day
I am addressing the tares; but the sheep themselves are the tares. O
evil Christians, O ye, who in filling only press the Church by your evil
lives; amend yourselves before the harvest come. “Say not, I have
sinned, and what hath befallen me?” <span
id="fr_2514"></span>[2515](#fn_2514.md) God hath not lost His power; but He
is requiring repentance from thee. I say this to the evil, who yet are
Christians; I say this to the tares. For they are in the field; and it
may so be, that they who to-day are tares, may to-morrow be wheat. And
so I will address the wheat also.

<span id="vii.xxv-p16"></span>4. O ye Christians, whose lives are good,
ye sigh and groan as being few among many, few among very many. The
winter will pass away, the summer will come; lo! the harvest will soon
be here. The angels will come who can make the separation, and who
cannot make mistakes. We in this time present are like those servants of
whom it was said, “Wilt Thou that we go and gather them up?” <span
id="fr_2515"></span>[2516](#fn_2515.md) for we were wishing, if it might be
so, that no evil ones should remain among the good. But it has been told
us, “Let both grow together until the harvest.” <span
id="fr_2516"></span>[2517](#fn_2516.md) Why? For ye are such as may be
deceived. Hear finally; “Lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up
also the wheat with them.” <span id="fr_2517"></span>[2518](#fn_2517.md)
What good are ye doing? Will ye by your eagerness make a waste of My
harvest? The reapers will come, and who the reapers are He hath
explained, “And the reapers are the angels.” <span
id="fr_2518"></span>[2519](#fn_2518.md) We are but men, the reapers are the
angels. We too indeed, if we finish our course, shall be equal to the
angels of God; but now when we chafe against the wicked, we are as yet
but men. And we ought now to give ear to the words, “Wherefore let him
that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.” <span
id="fr_2519"></span>[2520](#fn_2519.md) For do ye think, my Brethren, that
these tares we read of do not get up into this <span
id="fr_2520"></span>[2521](#fn_2520.md) seat? <span
id="fr_2521"></span>[2522](#fn_2521.md) Think ye that they are all below,
and none above up here? God grant we may not be so. “But with me it is a
very small thing that I should be judged of you.” <span
id="fr_2522"></span>[2523](#fn_2522.md) I tell you of a truth, my Beloved,
even in these high seats there is both wheat, and tares, and among the
laity there is wheat, and tares. Let the good tolerate the bad; let the
bad change themselves, and imitate the good. Let us all, if it may be
so, attain to God; let us all through His mercy escape the evil of this
world. Let us seek after good days, for we are now in evil days; but in
the evil days let us not blaspheme, that so we may be able to arrive at
the good days.
