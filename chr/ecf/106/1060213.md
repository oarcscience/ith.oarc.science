id="vi.vii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Of the Fact that from This
Point on to the Lord’s Supper, with Which Act the Discussion of All the
Narratives of the Four Evangelists Conjointly</span> <span

<span id="vi.vii.viii-p2"></span>8. Mark continues as follows: “And He
arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judæa by the farther
side of Jordan: and the people resort unto Him again; and, as He was
wont, He taught them again;” and so on, down to where it is said, “For
all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in
all that she had, even all her living.” <span
id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615.md) In this entire context, all the
above has been subjected to investigation already, with the view of
removing the appearance of any contrariety, when we were comparing the
other Gospels in due order with Matthew. This narrative, however, of the
poor widow who cast two mites into the treasury is reported only by two
of them, namely, Mark and Luke. <span
id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md) But their harmony admits of no
question. And from this point onwards to the Lord’s Supper, which latter
act formed the starting-point for our discussion of all the records of
the four evangelists taken conjointly, Mark introduces nothing of a kind
to make it necessary for us to institute a special comparison between it
and any other statement, or to conduct an inquiry with the view of
dispelling any appearance of discrepancy.
