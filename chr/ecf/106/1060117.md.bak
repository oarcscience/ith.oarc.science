<span id="vi.v.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—An Explanation of the Circumstance
that Matthew Tells Us How the Centurion Came to Jesus on Behalf of His
Servant, While Luke’s Statement is that the Centurion Despatched Friends
to Him.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxi-p2"></span>48. After these things, Matthew proceeds
with his narrative in the following terms: “And when Jesus was entered
into Capharnaum, there came unto Him a centurion, beseeching Him, and
saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, and he is
grievously tormented;” and so forth, on to the place where it is said,
“And his servant was healed in the self-same hour.” <span
id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md) This case of the centurion’s servant
is related also by Luke; only Luke does not bring it in, as Matthew
does, after the cleansing of the leper, whose story he has recorded as
something suggested to his recollection at a later stage, but introduces
it after the conclusion of that lengthened sermon already discussed. For
he connects the two sections in this way: “Now when He had ended all His
sayings in the audience of the people, He entered into Capharnaum; and a
certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick and ready
to die;” and so forth, until we come to the verse where it is said that
he was healed. <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md) Here, then, we
notice that it was not till after He had ended all His words in the
hearing of the people that Christ entered Capharnaum; by which we are to
understand simply that He did not make that entrance before He had
brought these sayings to their conclusion; and we are not to take it as
intimating the length of that period of time which intervened between
the delivery of these discourses and the entrance into Capharnaum. In
this interval that leper was cleansed, whose case is recorded by Matthew
in its own proper place, but is given by Luke only at a later
point. <span id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md)

<span id="vi.v.xxi-p6"></span>49. Accordingly, let us proceed to
consider whether Matthew and Luke are at one in the account of this
servant. Matthew’s words, then, are these: “There came unto Him a
centurion, beseeching Him, and saying, My servant lieth at home sick of
the palsy.” <span id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md) Now this seems to be
inconsistent with the version presented by Luke, which runs thus: “And
when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto Him the elders of the Jews,
beseeching Him that He would come and heal his servant. And when they
came to Jesus, they besought Him instantly, saying, That he was worthy
for whom He should do this: for he loveth our nation, and he hath built
us a synagogue. Then Jesus went with them. And when He was now not far
from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying unto Him,
Lord, trouble not Thyself; for I am not worthy that Thou shouldest enter
under my roof: wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto
Thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.” <span
id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) For if this was the manner in which
the incident took place, how can Matthew’s statement, that there “came
to Him a certain centurion,” be correct, seeing that the man did not
come in person, but sent his friends? The apparent discrepancy, however,
will disappear if we look carefully into the matter, and observe that
Matthew has simply held by a very familiar mode of expression. For not
only are we accustomed to speak of one as coming <span
id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md) even before he actually reaches the
place he is said to have approached, <span
id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) whence, too, we speak of one as making
small approach or making great approach <span
id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md) to what he is desirous of reaching;
but we also not unfrequently speak of that access, <span
id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869.md) for the sake of getting at which the
approach is made, as reached even although the person who is said to
reach another may not himself see the individual whom he reaches,
inasmuch as it may be through a friend that he reaches the person whose
favour is necessary to him. This, indeed, is a custom which has so
thoroughly established itself, that even in the language of every-day
life now those men are called *Perventores* <span
id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870.md) who, in the practice of
canvassing, <span id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871.md) get at the
inaccessible ears, as one may say, of any of the men of influence, by
the intervention of suitable personages. If, therefore, access <span
id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872.md) itself is thus familiarly said to be
gained by the means of other parties, how much more may an
approach <span id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873.md) be said to take place,
although it be by means of others, which always remains something short
of actual access! For it is surely the case, that a person may be able
to do very much in the way of approach, but yet may have failed to
succeed in actually reaching what he sought to get at. Consequently it
is nothing out of the way for Matthew,—a fact, indeed, which may be
understood by any intelligence,—when thus dealing <span id="page_127">p.
127</span> <span id="vi.v.xxi-Page_127"></span>with an approach on the
part of the centurion to the Lord, which was effected in the person of
others, to have chosen to express the matter in this compendious method,
“There came a centurion to Him.”

<span id="vi.v.xxi-p17"></span>50. At the same time, however, we must be
careful enough to discern a certain mystical depth in the phraseology
adopted by the evangelist, which is in accordance with these words of
the Psalm, “Come ye to Him, and be ye lightened.” <span
id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874.md) For in this way, inasmuch as the Lord
Himself commended the faith of the centurion, in which indeed his
approach was really made to Jesus, in such terms that He declared, “I
have not found so great faith in Israel,” the evangelist wisely chose to
speak of the man himself as coming to Jesus, rather than to bring in the
persons through whom he had conveyed his words. And furthermore, Luke
has unfolded the whole incident to us just as it occurred, in a form
constraining us to understand from his narrative in what manner another
writer, who was also incapable of making any false statement, might have
spoken of the man himself as coming. It is in this way, too, that the
woman who suffered from the issue of blood, although she took hold
merely of the hem of His garment, did yet touch the Lord more
effectually than those multitudes did by whom He was thronged. <span
id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875.md) For just as she touched the Lord the
more effectually, in so far as she believed the more earnestly, so the
centurion also came the more really to the Lord, inasmuch as he believed
the more thoroughly. And now, as regards the rest of this paragraph, it
would be a superfluous task to go over in detail the various matters
which are recounted by the one and omitted by the other. For, according
to the principle brought under notice at the outset, there is not to be
found in these peculiarities any actual antagonism between the writers.
