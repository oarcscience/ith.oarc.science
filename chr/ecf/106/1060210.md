<span id="vi.vii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Of the Words, “The More He Charged
Them to Tell No One, So Much the More a Great Deal They Published It;”
And of the Question Whether that Statement is Not Inconsistent with His
Prescience, Which is Commended to Our Notice in the Gospel.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.v-p2"></span>5. Mark continues thus: “And when Jesus
was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered
unto Him: and He was nigh unto the sea;” and so on, down to where we
read, “And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and
told Him all things, both what they had done, and what they had
taught.” <span id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597) This last portion
Mark has in common with Luke, and there is no discrepancy between them.
The rest of the contents of this section we have already discussed. Mark
continues in these terms: “And He said unto them, Come ye apart into a
desert place, and rest a while;” and so on, down to the words, “But the
more He charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;
and were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things
well: He maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.” <span
id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598) In all this there is nothing which
presents the appearance of any want of harmony between Mark and Luke;
and the whole of the above we have already considered, when we were
comparing these evangelists with Matthew. At the same time, we must make
sure that no one shall suppose that the last statement, which I have
cited here from Mark’s Gospel, is in antagonism with the entire body of
the evangelists, who, in reporting most of His other deeds and words,
make it plain that He knew what went on in men; that is to say, that
their thoughts and desires could not be concealed from Him. Thus John
puts it very clearly in the following passage: “But Jesus did not commit
Himself unto them, because He knew all men, and needed not that any
should testify of man; for He knew what was in man.” <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599) But what wonder is it that He
should discern the present thoughts of men, if He announced beforehand
to Peter the thought which he was to entertain in the future, <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600) but which he certainly had not
then, at the very time when he was boldly declaring himself ready to die
for Him, or with Him? <span id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601) This
being the case, then, how can it fail to appear as if this knowledge and
foreknowledge, which He possessed in so supreme a measure, is
contradicted by Mark’s statement, “He charged them that they should tell
no man: but the more He charged them, so much the more a great deal they
published it”? For if <span id="page_227">p. 227</span> <span
id="vi.vii.v-Page_227"></span>He, as one who held in His own knowledge
all the intentions of men, both present and future was aware that they
would publish it all the more the more He charged them not to publish
it, what purpose could He have in giving them such a charge? Well, but
may not the explanation be this, that he desired to give backward ones
to understand how much more zealously and fervently they ought to preach
on whom He lays the commission to preach, if even men who were
interdicted were unable to keep silent?
