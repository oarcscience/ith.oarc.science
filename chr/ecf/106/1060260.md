<span id="vii.xliii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xliii-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. xxii.
42](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042.md)<span id="vii.xliii-p3.2"></span>,
where the Lord asks the Jews whose son they said David was.*

<span id="vii.xliii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xliii-p4.1"></span>When</span> the Jews were asked (as we have
just now heard out of the Gospel when it was being read), how our Lord
Jesus Christ, whom David himself called his Lord was David’s Son, they
were not able to answer. For what they saw in the Lord, that they knew.
For He appeared to them as the Son of man; but as the Son of God He was
hidden. Hence it was, that they believed that He could be overcome, and
that they derided Him as He hung upon the Tree, saying, “If He be the
Son of God, let Him come down from the Cross, and we will believe on
Him.” <span id="fr_3038"></span>[3039](#fn_3038.md) They saw one part of
what He was, they knew not the other, “For had they known Him, they
would not have crucified the Lord of glory.” <span
id="fr_3039"></span>[3040](#fn_3039.md) Yet they knew that the Christ was
to be the Son of David. For even now they hope that He will come. They
know not that He is come already, but this their ignorance is voluntary.
For even if they did not acknowledge Him on the tree, they ought not to
have failed to acknowledge Him on His Throne. For in whose Name are all
nations called and blessed, but in His whom they think not to have been
the Christ? For this Son of David, that is, “of the seed of David
according to the flesh,” is the Son of Abraham. Now if it was said to
Abraham, “In thy seed shall all nations be blessed;” <span
id="fr_3040"></span>[3041](#fn_3040.md) and they see now that in our Christ
are all nations blessed, why wait they for what is already come, and
fear not that which is yet to come? for our Lord Jesus Christ, making
use of a prophetic testimony to assert His authority, called Himself
“the Stone.” Yea such a stone, “that whosoever shall stumble against it
shall be shaken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to
powder.” <span id="fr_3041"></span>[3042](#fn_3041.md) For when this stone
is stumbled against, it lieth low; by lying low, it “shaketh” him that
stumbleth against it; being lifted on high, by its coming down it
“grindeth” the proud “to powder.” Already therefore are the Jews
“shaken” by that stumbling; it yet remains that by His Glorious Advent
they should be “ground to powder” also, unless peradventure whilst they
are yet alive, they acknowledge Him that they die not. For God is
patient, and inviteth them day by day to the Faith.

<span id="vii.xliii-p9"></span>2. But when the Jews could not answer the
Lord proposing a question, and asking “whose Son they said Christ was;”
and they answered, “the Son of David;” <span
id="fr_3042"></span>[3043](#fn_3042.md) He goes on with the further
question put to them, “How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord,
saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on My right hand till I
make Thine enemies My footstool. If David then,” He saith, “in spirit
call Him Lord, how is He his Son?” <span
id="fr_3043"></span>[3044](#fn_3043.md) He did not say, “He is not his Son,
but how is He his son?” When he saith “How,” it is a word not of
negation, but of enquiry; as though He should say to them, “Ye say well
indeed that Christ is David’s Son, but David himself doth call Him Lord;
whom he then calleth Lord, how is He his Son?” Had the Jews been
instructed in the Christian faith, which we hold; had they not closed
their hearts against the Gospel, had they wished to <span
id="page_398">p. 398</span> <span id="vii.xliii-Page_398"></span>have
spiritual life in them, they would, as instructed in the faith of the
Church, have made answer to this question and said, “Because in the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was
God:” <span id="fr_3044"></span>[3045](#fn_3044.md) see how He is David’s
Lord. But because “The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;” <span
id="fr_3045"></span>[3046](#fn_3045.md) see how He is David’s Son. But as
being ignorant, they were silent, nor when they shut their mouths did
they open their ears, that what they could not answer when questioned,
they might after instruction know.

<span id="vii.xliii-p14"></span>3. But seeing that is a great thing to
know the mystery how He is David’s Son and David’s Lord: how one Person
is both Man and God; how in the form of Man He is less than the Father,
in the form of God equal with the Father; how again He saith, on the one
hand, “The Father is greater than I;” <span
id="fr_3046"></span>[3047](#fn_3046.md) and on the other, “I and My Father
are one;” <span id="fr_3047"></span>[3048](#fn_3047.md) seeing this is a
great mystery, <span id="fr_3048"></span>[3049](#fn_3048.md) our conduct
must be fashioned, that it may be comprehended. For to the unworthy is
it closed up, it is opened to those who are meet for it. It is not with
stones, or clubs, or the fist, or the heel, that we knock unto the Lord.
It is the life which knocks, it is to the life that it is opened. The
seeking is with the heart, the asking is with the heart, the knocking is
with the heart, the opening is to the heart. Now that heart which asks
rightly, and knocks and seeks rightly, must be godly. Must first love
God for His Own sake (for this is godliness); and not propose to itself
any reward which it looks for from Him other than God Himself. For than
Him is there nothing better. And what precious thing can he ask of God,
in whose sight God Himself is lightly esteemed? He giveth earth, and
thou rejoicest, thou lover of the earth, who art thyself become earth.
If when He giveth earthly goods, thou dost rejoice, how much more
oughtest thou to rejoice when He giveth thee Himself, who made heaven
and earth? So then God must be loved for His own sake. For the Devil not
knowing what was passing in the heart of holy Job, brought this as a
great charge against him, saying, “Doth Job worship God for His Own
sake.” <span id="fr_3049"></span>[3050](#fn_3049.md)

<span id="vii.xliii-p19"></span>4. So then if the adversary brought this
charge, we ought to fear lest it be brought against us. For with a very
slanderous accuser have we to deal. If he seek to invent what is not,
how much more will he seek to object what really is. Nevertheless let us
rejoice, that ours is such a Judge, as cannot be deceived by our
accuser. For if we had a man for our judge, the enemy might invent for
him what he would. For none is more subtle in invention than the devil.
For he it is who at this time also invents all false accusations against
the saints. He knows his accusations can have no avail with God, and so
He scatters them among men. Yet what does this profit him, seeing the
Apostle says, “Our glorying is this, the testimony of our
conscience?” <span id="fr_3050"></span>[3051](#fn_3050.md) Yet think ye
that he does not invent these false charges with aught of subtlety? Yes,
well he knows what evil he shall work thereby, if the watchfulness of
faith resist him not. For for this reason scatters he his evil charges
against the good, that the weak may think that there are no good, and so
may give themselves up to be hurried along, and made a prey of by their
lusts, whilst they say within themselves, “For who is there that keeps
the commandments of God, or who is there that preserves chastity?” and
whilst he thinks that no one does, he himself becomes that no one. This
then is the devil’s art. But such a man was Job, that he could not
invent any such charge against him; for his life was too well known and
manifest. But because he had great riches, he brought that against him,
which if it had any existence, might lie in the heart, and not appear in
the conduct. He worshipped God, he gave alms; and with what heart he did
this none knew, no not the Devil himself; but God had known. God giveth
His testimony to His own servant; the Devil calumniates the servant of
God. He is allowed to be tried, Job is proved, the Devil is confounded.
Job is found to worship God for His Own sake, to love Him for His Own
sake; not because He gave him ought, but because He did not take away
Himself. For he said, “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as it
seemed good to the Lord, so is it done, blessed be the Name of the
Lord.”  <span id="fr_3051"></span>[3052](#fn_3051.md) The fire of
temptation approached him; but it found him gold, not stubble; it
cleared away the dross from it, but did not reduce it to ashes.

<span id="vii.xliii-p22"></span>5. Because then, in order to understand
the mystery <span id="fr_3052"></span>[3053](#fn_3052.md) of God, how
Christ is both man and God, the heart must be cleansed: and it is
cleansed by a good conversation, by a pure life, <span
id="fr_3053"></span>[3054](#fn_3053.md) by chastity, and sanctity, and
love, and by “faith, which worketh by love” <span
id="fr_3054"></span>[3055](#fn_3054.md) (now all this that I am speaking
of, is, as it were, the tree which hath its root in the heart; for it is
only from the root of the heart that actions proceed; in which if thou
plant desire, thorns spring forth; if thou plant charity, good fruit):
the Lord, after that question which He had proposed to the Jews, when
they were not able to answer it, immediately went on to speak of good
actions, that He might show why they were unworthy to understand what He
asked them. For when those proud and wretched men were not able to
answer, they ought of course to have said, “we do not know; Master, tell
us.” But no: they <span id="page_399">p. 399</span> <span
id="vii.xliii-Page_399"></span>were speechless at the proposing of the
question, and they opened not their mouth to seek instruction. And so
the Lord in reference to their pride said immediately, “Beware of the
Scribes which love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the first
rooms at feasts.” <span id="fr_3055"></span>[3056](#fn_3055.md) Not because
they hold them, but because they love them. For in these words he
accused their heart. Now none can accuse the heart, but He who can
inspect it. For meet it is that to the servant of God, who holds some
post of honour in the Church, the first place should be assigned;
because if it were not given him, it were evil for him who refuses to
give it; but yet it is no good to him to whom it is given. It is meet
and right then that in the congregation of Christians their
Prelates <span id="fr_3056"></span>[3057](#fn_3056.md) should sit in
eminent place, that by their very seat they may be distinguished, and
that their office may be duly marked; yet not so that they should be
puffed up for their seat; but that they should esteem it a burden, for
which they are to render an account. But who knows whether they love
this, or do not love it? This is a matter of the heart, it can have no
other judge but God. Now the Lord Himself warned His disciples, that
they should not fall into this leaven; as He calls it in another place,
“Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.” <span
id="fr_3057"></span>[3058](#fn_3057.md) And when they supposed that He said
this to them because they had brought no bread; He answered them, “Have
ye forgotten how many thousands were filled with the five loaves? Then
understood they,” it is said, “that He called their doctrine
leaven.” <span id="fr_3058"></span>[3059](#fn_3058.md) For these present
temporal good things they loved, but they neither feared the evil things
eternal, nor loved the good things eternal. And so their hearts being
closed, they could not understand what the Lord asked them.

<span id="vii.xliii-p30"></span>6. But what then has the Church of God
to do, that it may be able to understand what it has first
obtained <span id="fr_3059"></span>[3060](#fn_3059.md) grace to believe? It
must make the mind capacious for receiving what shall be given it. And
that this may be done, that the mind, that is, may be capacious, our
Lord God suspends His promises, He has not taken them away. Therefore
does He suspend them, that we may stretch out ourselves; and therefore
do we stretch ourselves out, that we may grow; and therefore do we grow,
that we may reach them. Behold the Apostle Paul stretching himself out
unto these suspended promises: “Not as though I had already attained,
either were already perfect. Brethren, I count not myself to have
apprehended: but this one thing I do; forgetting those things which are
behind, and stretching forth unto those things which are before, I press
earnestly toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
Christ Jesus.” <span id="fr_3060"></span>[3061](#fn_3060.md) He was running
on the earth; the prize hung suspended from heaven. He ran then on the
earth; but in spirit he ascended. Behold him thus stretching himself
out, behold him hanging forth after the suspended prize. “I press on,”
he says, “for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.”

<span id="vii.xliii-p33"></span>7. We must journey on then, yet for this
no need of anointing the feet, or looking out for beasts, or providing a
vessel. Run with the heart’s affection, journey on with love, ascend by
charity. Why seekest thou for the way? Cleave unto Christ, who by
Descending and Ascending hath made Himself the Way. Dost thou wish to
ascend? Hold fast to Him that ascendeth. For by thine own self thou
canst not rise. “For no man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came
down from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven.” <span
id="fr_3061"></span>[3062](#fn_3061.md) If no one ascendeth but He that
descended, that is, the Son of Man, our Lord Jesus, dost thou wish to
ascend also? Be then a member of Him who Only hath ascended. For He the
Head, with all the members, is but One Man. And since no one can ascend,
but he who in His Body is made a member of Him; that is fulfilled, “that
no man hath ascended, but He that descended.” For thou canst not say,
“Lo, why hath Peter, for instance, ascended, why hath Paul ascended, why
have the Apostles ascended, if no one hath ascended, but He that
descended?” The answer to this is, “What do Peter, and Paul, and the
rest of the Apostles, and all the faithful, what do they hear from the
Apostle? ‘Now ye are the Body of Christ, and members in
particular.’ <span id="fr_3062"></span>[3063](#fn_3062.md) If then the Body
of Christ and His members belong to One, do not thou make two of them.
For He left ‘father and mother, and clave to his wife, that two might be
one flesh.’ <span id="fr_3063"></span>[3064](#fn_3063.md) He left His
Father, in that here He did not show Himself as equal with the Father;
but ‘emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant.’ <span
id="fr_3064"></span>[3065](#fn_3064.md) He left His mother also, the
synagogue of which He was born after the flesh. He clave to His Wife,
that is, to His Church. Now in the place where Christ Himself brought
forward this testimony, He showed that the marriage bond might not be
dissolved: ‘Have ye not read,’ said He, ‘that God which made them at the
beginning, made them male and female; and said, They twain shall be in
one flesh? What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
asunder.’  <span id="fr_3065"></span>[3066](#fn_3065.md) And what is the
meaning of ‘They twain shall be in one flesh’? He goes on to say;
‘Wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh.’ Thus ‘no man hath
ascended, but He that descended.’” <span
id="fr_3066"></span>[3067](#fn_3066.md)

<span id="vii.xliii-p40"></span>8. For that ye may know, that the
Bridegroom <span id="page_400">p. 400</span> <span
id="vii.xliii-Page_400"></span>and the Bride are One according to the
Flesh of Christ, not according to His Divinity (for according to His
Divinity we cannot be what He is; seeing that He is the Creator, we the
creature; He the Maker, we His work; He the Framer, we framed by Him;
but in order that we might be one with Him in Him, He vouchsafed to be
our Head, by taking of us flesh wherein to die for us); that ye may know
then that this whole is One Christ, He said by Isaiah, “He hath bound a
mitre on me as a bridegroom, and clothed me with ornaments as a
bride.” <span id="fr_3067"></span>[3068](#fn_3067.md) He is then at once
the Bridegroom and the Bride. That is, the Bridegroom in Himself as the
Head, the Bride in the body. “For they twain,” saith He, “shall be in
one flesh; so now they are no more twain, but one flesh.”

<span id="vii.xliii-p42"></span>9. Seeing then that we are of His
members, in order that we may understand this mystery as I have said,
Brethren, let us live holily, let us love God for His Own sake. Now He
who showeth to us while in our pilgrimage the form of a servant,
reserveth for those that reach their country the form of God. With the
form of a servant hath He laid down the way, with the form of God He
hath prepared the home. Seeing then that it is a hard matter for us to
comprehend this, but no hard matter to believe it; for Isaiah says,
“Unless ye believe ye shall not understand;” <span
id="fr_3068"></span>[3069](#fn_3068.md) let us “walk by faith as long as we
are in pilgrimage from the Lord, till we come to sight where we shall
see face to face.” <span id="fr_3069"></span>[3070](#fn_3069.md) As walking
by faith, let us do good works. In these good works, let there be a free
love of God for His Own sake, and an active <span
id="fr_3070"></span>[3071](#fn_3070.md) love of our neighbour. For we have
nothing we can do for God; but because we have something we may do for
our neighbour, we shall by our good offices to the needy, gain His
favour who is the source of all abundance. <span
id="fr_3071"></span>[3072](#fn_3071.md) Let every one then do what he can
for others; let him freely bestow upon the needy of his superfluity. One
has money; let him feed the poor, let him clothe the naked, let him
build a church, let him do with his money all the good he can. Another
has good counsel; let him guide his neighbour, let him by the light of
holiness drive away the darkness of doubting. Another has learning; let
him draw out of this store of the Lord, let him minister food to his
fellow-servants, strengthen the faithful, recall the wandering, seek the
lost, do all the good he can. Something there is, which even the poor
may deal out to one another; let one lend feet to the lame, another give
his own eyes to guide the blind; another visit the sick, another bury
the dead. These are things which all may do, so that in a word it would
be hard to find one who has not some means of doing good to others. And
last of all comes that important duty which the Apostle speaks of; “Bear
ye one another’s burdens, and so shall ye fulfil the law of
Christ.” <span id="fr_3072"></span>[3073](#fn_3072.md)
