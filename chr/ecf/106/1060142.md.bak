<span id="vi.v.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV.—Of the Order and the Method in
Which All the Four Evangelists Come to the Narration of the Miracle of
the Five Loaves.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xlvi-p2"></span>93. After stating how the report of
John’s death was brought to Christ, Matthew continues his account, and
introduces it in the following connection: “When Jesus heard of it, He
departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people
had heard thereof, they followed Him on foot out of the cities. And He
went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion
toward them, and He healed their sick.” <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md) He mentions, therefore, that this
took place immediately after John had suffered. Consequently it was
after this that those things took place which have been previously
recorded—namely, the circumstances which alarmed Herod, and induced him
to say, “John have I beheaded.” <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050.md) For it must surely be understood
that these incidents occurred subsequently which report carried to the
ears of Herod, so that he became anxious, and was in perplexity as to
who that person possibly could be of whom he heard things so remarkable,
when he had himself put John to death. Mark, again, after relating how
John suffered, mentions that the disciples who had been sent forth
returned to Jesus, and told Him all that they had done and taught; and
that the Lord (a fact which he alone records) directed them to rest for
a little while in a desert place, and that He went on board a vessel
with them, and departed; and that the crowds of people, when they
perceived that movement, went before them to that place; and that the
Lord had compassion on them, and taught them many things; and that, when
the hour was now advancing, it came to pass that all who were present
were made to eat of the five loaves and the two fishes. <span
id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051.md) This miracle has been recorded by
all the four evangelists. For in like manner, Luke, who has given an
account of the death of John at a much earlier stage in his
narrative, <span id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md) in connection with
the occasion of which we have spoken, in the present context tells us
first of Herod’s perplexity as to who the Lord could be, and immediately
thereafter appends statements to the same effect with those in
Mark,—namely, that the apostles returned to Him, and reported to Him all
that they had done; and that then He took them with Him and departed
into a desert place, and that the multitudes followed Him thither, and
that He spake to them concerning the kingdom of God, and restored those
who stood in need of healing. Then, too, he mentions that, when the day
was declining, the miracle of the five loaves was wrought. <span
id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053.md)

<span id="vi.v.xlvi-p8"></span>94. But John, again, who differs greatly
from those three in this respect, that he deals more with the discourses
which the Lord delivered than with the works which He so marvellously
wrought, after recording how He left Judæa and departed the second time
into Galilee, which departure is understood to have taken place at the
time to which the other evangelists also refer when they tell us that on
John’s imprisonment He went into Galilee,—after recording this, I say,
John inserts in the immediate context of his narrative the considerable
discourse which He spake as He was passing through Samaria, on the
occasion of His meeting with the Samaritan woman whom He found at the
well; and then he states that two days after this He departed thence and
went into Galilee, and that thereupon He came to Cana of Galilee, where
He had turned the water into wine, and that there He healed the son of a
certain nobleman. <span id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054.md) But as to
other things which the rest have told us He did and said in Galilee,
John is silent. At the same time, however, he mentions something which
the others have left unnoticed,—namely, the fact that He went up to
Jerusalem on the day of the feast, and there wrought the miracle on the
man who had the infirmity of thirty-eight years standing, and who found
no one by whose help he might be carried down to the pool in which
people afflicted with various diseases were <span id="page_148">p.
148</span> <span id="vi.v.xlvi-Page_148"></span>healed. <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md) In connection with this, John also
relates how He spake many things on that occasion. He tells us, further,
that after these events He departed across the sea of Galilee, which is
also the sea of Tiberias, and that a great multitude followed Him; that
thereupon He went away to a mountain, and there sat with His
disciples,—the passover, a feast of the Jews, being then nigh; that
then, on lifting up His eyes and seeing a very great company, He fed
them with the five loaves and the two fishes; <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md) which notice is given us also by
the other evangelists. And this makes it certain that he has passed by
those incidents which form the course along which these others have come
to introduce the notice of this miracle into their narratives.
Nevertheless, while different methods of narration, as it appears, are
prosecuted, and while the first three evangelists have thus left
unnoticed certain matters which the fourth has recorded, we see how
those three, on the one hand, who have been keeping nearly the same
course, have found a direct meeting-point with each other at this
miracle of the five loaves; and how this fourth writer, on the other
hand, who is conversant above all with the profound teachings of the
Lord’s discourses, in relating some other matters on which the rest are
silent, has sped round in a certain method upon their track, and, while
about to soar off from their pathway after a brief space again into the
region of loftier subjects, has found a meeting-point with them in the
view of presenting this narrative of the miracle of the five loaves,
which is common to them all.
