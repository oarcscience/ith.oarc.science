<span id="vi.iv.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—Of the Fact that Idolatry Has
Been Subverted by the Name of Christ, and by the Faith of Christians
According to the Prophecies.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxvi-p2"></span>40. For truly what is thus effected by
Christians is not a thing which belongs only to Christian times, but one
which was predicted very long ago. Those very Jews who have remained
enemies to the name of Christ, and regarding whose destined perfidy
these prophetic writings have not been silent, do themselves possess and
peruse the prophet who says: “O Lord my God, and my refuge in the day of
evil, the Gentiles shall come unto Thee from the ends of the earth, and
shall say, Surely our fathers have worshipped mendacious idols, and
there is no profit in them.” <span id="fr_612"></span>[613](#fn_612)
Behold, that is now being done; behold, now the Gentiles are coming from
the ends of the earth to Christ, uttering things like these, and
breaking their idols! Of signal consequence, too, is this which God has
done for His Church in its world-wide extension, in that the Jewish
nation, which has been deservedly overthrown and scattered abroad
throughout the lands, has been made to carry about with it everywhere
the records of our prophecies, so that it might not be possible to look
upon these predictions as concocted by ourselves; and thus the enemy of
our faith has been made a witness to our truth. How, then, can it be
possible that the disciples of Christ have taught what they have not
learned from Christ, as those foolish men in their silly fancies object,
with the view of getting the superstitious worship of heathen gods and
idols subverted? Can it be said also that those prophecies which are
still read in these days, in the books of the enemies of Christ, were
the inventions of the disciples of Christ?

<span id="vi.iv.xxvi-p4"></span>41. Who, then, has effected the
demolition of these systems but the God of Israel? For to this people
was the announcement made by those divine voices which were addressed to
Moses: “Hear, O Israel; the Lord thy God is one God.” <span
id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613) “Thou shalt not make unto thee any
graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or
that is in the earth beneath.” <span id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614)
And again, in order that this peo<span id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxvi-Page_94"></span>ple might put an end to these things
wherever it received power to do so, this commandment was also laid upon
the nation: “Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them; thou
shalt not do after their works, but thou shalt utterly overthrow them,
and quite break down their images.” <span
id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615) But who shall say that Christ and
Christians have no connection with Israel, seeing that Israel was the
grandson of Abraham, to whom first, as afterwards to his son Isaac, and
then to his grandson Israel himself, that promise was given, which I
have already mentioned, namely: “In thy seed shall all nations be
blessed”? That prediction we see now in its fulfilment in Christ. For it
was of this line that the Virgin was born, concerning whom a prophet of
the people of Israel and of the God of Israel sang in these terms:
“Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son; and they shall
call <span id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616) His name Emmanuel.” For by
interpretation, Emmanuel means, “God with us.” <span
id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617) This God of Israel, therefore, who has
interdicted the worship of other gods, who has interdicted the making of
idols, who has commanded their destruction, who by His prophet has
predicted that the Gentiles from the ends of the earth would say,
“Surely our fathers have worshipped mendacious idols, in which there is
no profit;” this same God is He who, by the name of Christ and by the
faith of Christians, has ordered, promised, and exhibited the overthrow
of all these superstitions. In vain, therefore, do these unhappy men,
knowing that they have been prohibited from blaspheming the name of
Christ, even by their own gods, that is to say, by the demons who fear
the name of Christ, seek to make it out, that this kind of doctrine is
something strange to Him, in the power of which the Christians dispute
against idols, and root out all those false religions, wherever they
have the opportunity.
