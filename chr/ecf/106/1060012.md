<span id="v.ii.vi"></span>

<span id="v.ii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.</span>

<span id="v.ii.vi-p2"></span>16. Hence there follows most justly the
statement, “Ye are the salt of the earth;” showing that those parties
are to be judged insipid, who, either in the eager pursuit after
abundance of earthly blessings, or through the dread of want, lose the
eternal things which can neither be given nor taken away by men.
“But <span id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52) if the salt have lost <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53) its savour, wherewith shall it be
salted?” *i.e.*, If ye, by means of whom the nations in a measure are to
be preserved \[from corruption\], through the dread of temporal
persecutions shall lose the kingdom of heaven, where will be the men
through whom error may be removed from you, since God has chosen you, in
order that through you He might remove the error of others? Hence the
savourless salt is “good for nothing, but to be cast out, and trodden
under foot of men.” It is not therefore he who suffers persecution, but
he who is rendered savourless by the fear of persecution, that is
trodden under foot of men. For it is only one who is undermost that can
be trodden under foot; but he is not undermost, who, however many things
he may suffer in his body on the earth, yet has his heart fixed in
heaven. <span id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54)

<span id="v.ii.vi-p6"></span>17. “Ye are the light <span
id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55) of the world.” In the same way as He said
above, “the salt of the <span id="page_9">p. 9</span> <span
id="v.ii.vi-Page_9"></span>earth,” so now He says, “the light of the
world.” For in the former case that earth is not to be understood which
we tread with our bodily feet, but the men who dwell upon the earth, or
even the sinners, for the preserving of whom and for the extinguishing
of whose corruptions the Lord sent the apostolic salt. And here, by the
world must be understood not the heavens and the earth, but the men who
are in the world or love the world, for the enlightening of whom the
apostles were sent. <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56) “A city that is
set on <span id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57) an hill cannot be hid,”
*i.e.* \[a city\] founded upon great and distinguished righteousness,
which is also the meaning of the mountain itself on which our Lord is
discoursing. “Neither do men light a candle <span
id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58) and put it under a bushel measure.” <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59) What view are we to take? That the
expression “under a bushel measure” is so used that only the concealment
of the candle is to be understood, as if He were saying, No one lights a
candle and conceals it? Or does the bushel measure also mean something,
so that to place a candle under a bushel is this, to place the comforts
of the body higher than the preaching of the truth; so that one does not
preach the truth so long as he is afraid of suffering any annoyance in
corporeal and temporal things? And it is well said a bushel measure,
whether on account of the recompense of measure, for each one receives
the things done in his body,—“that every one,” says the apostle, “may
there receive <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60) the things done in
his body;” and it is said in another place, as if of this bushel measure
of the body, “For with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you
again:” <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61) —or because temporal good
things, which are carried to completion in the body, are both begun and
come to an end in a certain definite number of days, which is perhaps
meant by the “bushel measure;” while eternal and spiritual things are
confined within no such limit, “for God giveth not the Spirit by
measure.” <span id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62) Every one, therefore, who
obscures and covers up the light of good doctrine by means of temporal
comforts, places his candle under a bushel measure. “But on a
candlestick.” <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63) Now it is placed on a
candlestick by him who subordinates his body to the service of God, so
that the preaching of the truth is the higher, and the serving of the
body the lower; yet by means even of the service of the body the
doctrine shines more conspicuously, inasmuch as it is insinuated into
those who learn by means of bodily functions, *i.e.* by means of the
voice and tongue, and the other movements of the body in good works. The
apostle therefore puts his candle on a candlestick, when he says, “So
fight I, not as one that beateth <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64)
the air; but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest
that by any means, when I preach to others, I myself should be found a
castaway.” <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65) When He says, however,
“that it may give light to all who are in the house,” I am of opinion
that it is the abode of men which is called a house, *i.e.* the world
itself, on account of what He says before, “Ye are the light of the
world;” or if any one chooses to understand the house as being the
Church, this, too, is not out of place.

<span id="v.ii.vi-p5"></span> Others follow Augustin in regarding the
connection of this verse and the next with the preceding one as very
close. All the more must they refuse to yield to persecution, as they
have a function in the world which is well represented by salt and light
(Weizsäcker, Meyer, etc.). The function of salt is to preserve and to
season. With it Elisha healed the unwholesome water ([2 Kings ii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#021)<span id="v.ii.vi-p5.1"></span>).
The use of salt in the sacrifices is, no doubt, alluded to (Tholuck). It
becomes savourless. Dr. Thomson says (*Land and Book*, ii. 43), “It is a
well-known fact that the salt in this country (gathered from the marshes
in dry weather), when in contact with the ground, or exposed to air and
sun, does become insipid and useless.” The disciples are appointed to
communicate the truth and moral grace, before spoken of in the
Beatitudes, to counteract the error and corruption in the earth. “Earth”
not to be confined to “society as then existing, the definite form the
world then presented” (Lange), but to mankind in general, as Augustin
below. “Wherewith shall it be salted” does not imply that those who have
once fallen cannot be reclaimed (Alford). The comment of Grotius is
good: “*Ipsi emendare alios debebent, non autem exspectare ut ab aliis
ipsi emendarentur*” (“They ought to improve others, not expect to be
themselves improved by others”).

<span id="v.ii.vi-p7"></span> *Lumen*, also used for a *luminary*;
Vulgate, *lux*. In a lower and derivative sense are the disciples “the
light,” etc. (Alford), deriving their light-giving quality from Him who
is the “Light of the world” ([John viii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012)<span id="v.ii.vi-p7.1"></span>), so
that they become “lights in the world” ([Phil. ii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015)<span id="v.ii.vi-p7.2"></span>).

<span id="v.ii.vi-p8"></span> “The influence of salt is internal, of
light external: hence the element in which they work, the *earth* and

external form” (Schaff).

was probably visible. Some have thought of the village on Mount Tabor,
others of an ancient fortress, predecessor of the present Safed (Dean
Stanley, Thomson); certainly not Jerusalem (Weizsäcker).
