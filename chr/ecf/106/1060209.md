<span id="vi.vii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Of the Question Whether Mark’s
Reports of the Repeated Occasions on Which the Name of Peter Was Brought
into Prominence are Not at Variance with the Statement Which John Has
Given Us of the Particular Time at Which the Apostle Received that
Name.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.iv-p2"></span>4. The same Mark continues as follows:
“And there came a leper to Him, beseeching Him, and kneeling down to
Him, and saying unto Him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean;” and
so on, down to where it is said, “And they cried out, saying, Thou art
the Son of God: and He straightway charged them that they should not
make Him known.” <span id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592) Luke <span
id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593) also records something similar to
the last passage which we have here adduced. But nothing emerges
involving any discrepancy. Mark proceeds thus: “And He goeth up into a
mountain, and calleth unto Him whom He would: and they came unto Him.
And He ordained twelve that they should be with Him, and that He might
send them forth to preach; and He gave them power to heal sicknesses,
and to cast out devils. And Simon He surnamed Peter;” and so on, down to
where it is said, “And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis
how great things Jesus had done: and all men did marvel.” <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594) I am aware that I have spoken
already of the names of the disciples when following the order of
Matthew’s narrative. <span id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595) Here,
therefore, I repeat the caution, that no one should suppose Simon to
have received the name Peter on this occasion for the first time, or
fancy that Mark is here in any antagonism with John, who reports that
disciple to have been addressed long before in these terms: “Thou shalt
be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, A stone.” <span
id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596) For John has there recorded the
very words in which the Lord gave him that name. Mark, on the other
hand, has introduced the matter in the form of a recapitulation in this
passage, when he says, “And Simon He surnamed Peter.” For, as it was his
intention to enumerate the names of the twelve apostles here, and it was
necessary for him thus to mention Peter, he decided briefly to intimate
the fact that the said name was not borne by that disciple all along,
but was given him by the Lord, not, however, at the time with which Mark
was immediately dealing, but on the occasion in connection with which
John has introduced the very words employed by the Lord. The other
matters embraced within this paragraph, present nothing inconsistent
with any of the other Gospels, and they have also been discussed
previously.
