<span id="vi.iv.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.—On the Authority of the
Gospels.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vi.iv.i-p2.1"></span>In</span> the entire number of those divine
records which are contained in the sacred writings, the gospel
deservedly stands pre-eminent. For what the law and the prophets
aforetime announced as destined to come to pass, is exhibited in the
gospel in its realization <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) and
fulfilment. The first preachers of this gospel were the apostles, who
beheld our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in person when He was yet
present in the flesh. And not only did these <span
id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md) men keep in remembrance the words
heard from His lips, and the deeds wrought by Him beneath their eyes;
but they were also careful, when the duty of preaching the gospel was
laid upon them, to make mankind acquainted with those divine and
memorable occurrences which took place at a period antecedent to the
formation of their own connection with Him in the way of discipleship,
which belonged also to the time of His nativity, His infancy, or His
youth, and with regard to which they were able to institute exact
inquiry and to obtain information, either at His own hand or at the
hands of His parents or other parties, on the ground of the most
reliable intimations and the most trustworthy testimonies. Certain of
them also—namely, Matthew and John—gave to the world, in their
respective books, a written account of all those matters which it seemed
needful to commit to writing concerning Him.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p5"></span>2. And to preclude the supposition that, in
what concerns the apprehension and proclamation of the gospel, it is a
matter of any consequence whether the enunciation comes by men who were
actual followers of this same Lord here <span id="page_78">p. 78</span>
<span id="vi.iv.i-Page_78"></span>when He manifested Himself in the
flesh and had the company of His disciples attendant on Him, or by
persons who with due credit received facts with which they became
acquainted in a trustworthy manner through the instrumentality of these
former, divine providence, through the agency of the Holy Spirit, has
taken care that certain of those also who were nothing more than
followers of the first apostles should have authority given them not
only to preach the gospel, but also to compose an account of it in
writing. I refer to Mark and Luke. All those other individuals, however,
who have attempted or dared to offer a written record of the acts of the
Lord or of the apostles, failed to commend themselves in their own times
as men of the character which would induce the Church to yield them its
confidence, and to admit their compositions to the canonical authority
of the Holy Books. And this was the case not merely because they were
persons who could make no rightful claim to have credit given them in
their narrations, but also because in a deceitful manner they introduced
into their writings certain matters which are condemned at once by the
catholic and apostolic rule of faith, and by sound doctrine.  <span
