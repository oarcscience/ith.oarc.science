<span id="vi.vi.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Of the Harmony Characterizing the
Accounts Which These Evangelists Give of What Happened When the Lord Was
Led Away to the House of the High Priest, as Also of the Occurrences
Which Took Place Within the Said House After He Was Conducted There in
the Nighttime, and in Particular of the Incident of Peter’s
Denial.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.vii-p2"></span>19. In the line of Matthew’s narrative we
come next upon this statement: “And they that laid hold on Jesus led Him
away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were
assembled.” <span id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287.md) We learn,
however, from John that He was conducted first to Annas, the
father-in-law of Caiaphas. <span id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288.md) On
the other hand, Mark and Luke omit all mention of the name of the high
priest. <span id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289.md) Moreover \[we find
that\] He was led away bound. For, as John informs us, there were at
hand there, in the multitude, a tribune and a cohort, and the servants
of the Jews. <span id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290.md) Then in Matthew
we have these words: “But Peter followed Him afar off unto the high
priest’s palace, and went in and sat with the servants to see the
end.” <span id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291.md) To this passage in the
narrative Mark makes this addition: “And he warmed himself at the
fire.” <span id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md) Luke also makes a
statement which amounts to the same, thus: “Peter followed afar off: and
when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sat down
together, Peter sat down among them.” <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293.md) And John proceeds in these terms:
“And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That
disciple (namely, that other) was known unto the high priest, and went
in (as John also tells us) with Jesus into the palace of the high
priest. But Peter (as the same John adds) stood at the door without.
Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest,
and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.” <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294.md) For the last fact we are thus
indebted to John’s narrative. And in this way we see how it came about
that Peter also got inside, and was within the hall, as the other
evangelists mention. <span id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295.md)

<span id="vi.vi.vii-p12"></span>20. Then Matthew’s report goes on thus:
“Now the chief priests and elders and all the council sought false
witness against Jesus, to put Him to death, but found none: yea, though
many false witnesses came, yet found they none.” <span
id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296.md) Mark comes in here with the
explanation, that “their witness agreed not together.” <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297.md) But, as Matthew continues, “At the
last came two false witnesses, and said, This fellow said, I am able to
destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.” <span
id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298.md) Mark states that there were also
others who said, “We have heard him say, I will destroy this temple that
is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made
without hands. And therefore (as Mark also observes in the same passage)
their witness did not agree together.” <span
id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299.md) Then Matthew gives us the following
relation: “And the high priest arose and said unto Him, Answerest thou
nothing? What is it which these witness against thee? But Jesus held His
peace. And the high priest answered and said unto Him, I adjure thee by
the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of
God. Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said.” <span
id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300.md) Mark reports the same passage in
different terms, only he omits to mention the fact that the high priest
adjured Him. He makes it plain, however, that the two expressions
ascribed to Jesus as the reply to the high priest,—namely, “Thou hast
said,” and, “I am,” <span id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md) —really
amount to the same. For, as the said Mark puts it, the narrative goes on
thus: “And Jesus said, I am; and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on
the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.” <span
id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md) This is just as Matthew also
presents the passage, with the solitary exception that he does not say
that Jesus replied in the phrase “I am.” Again, Matthew goes on further
in this strain: “Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath
spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now ye
have heard his blasphemy. What think ye? And they answered and said, He
is guilty of death.” <span id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md) Mark’s
version of this is entirely to the same effect. So Matthew continues,
“Then did they spit in His face, and buffeted Him, and others smote Him
with the palms of their hands, saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ,
Who is he that smote thee?” <span id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304.md)
Mark reports these things in like manner. He also mentions a further
fact, namely, that they covered His face. <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305.md) On these incidents we have likewise
the testimony of Luke.

<span id="vi.vi.vii-p23"></span>21. These things the Lord is understood
to have passed through on to the early morning in the high priest’s
house, to which He was first conducted, and in which Peter was also
tempted. <span id="page_186">p. 186</span> <span
id="vi.vi.vii-Page_186"></span>With respect, however, to this temptation
of Peter, which took place during the time that the Lord was enduring
these injuries, the several evangelists do not present the same order in
the recital of the circumstances. For Matthew and Mark first narrate the
injuries offered to the Lord, and then this temptation of Peter. Luke,
again, first describes Peter’s temptation, and only after that the
reproaches borne by the Lord; while John, on the other hand, first
recounts part of Peter’s temptation, then introduces some verses
recording what the Lord had to bear, next appends a statement to the
effect that the Lord was sent away thence (*i.e.* from Annas) to
Caiaphas the high priest, and then at this point resumes and sums up the
relation which he had commenced of Peter’s temptation in the house to
which he was first conducted, giving a full account of that incident,
thereafter reverting to the succession of things befalling the Lord, and
telling us how He was brought to Caiaphas. <span
id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306.md)

<span id="vi.vi.vii-p25"></span>22. Accordingly, Matthew proceeds as
follows: “Now Peter sat without in the palace; and a damsel came unto
him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. But he denied before
them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. And as he went out into
the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there,
This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. And again he denied with an
oath, I do not know the man. And after a while came unto him they that
stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them, for thy
speech bewrayeth thee. Then began he to curse and to swear, saying that
he knew not the man. And immediately the cock crew.” <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307.md) Such is Matthew’s version. But we
are also given to understand that after he had gone outside, and when he
had now denied the Lord once, the first cock crew,—a fact which Matthew
does not specify, but which is intimated by Mark.

<span id="vi.vi.vii-p27"></span>23. But it was not when he was outside
at the gate that he denied the Lord the second time. That took place
after he had come back to the fire-place. There was no need, however, to
mention the precise time at which he did thus return. Consequently Mark
goes on with his narrative of the incident in these terms: “And he went
out into the porch, and the cock crew. And a maid saw him again, and
began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them. And he denied
it again.” <span id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308.md) This is not the
same maid, however, as the former one, but another, as Matthew tells us.
Nay, we gather further that on the occasion of the second denial he was
addressed by two parties, namely, by the maid who is mentioned by
Matthew and Mark, and also by another person who is noticed by Luke. For
Luke’s account runs in this style: “And Peter followed afar off. And
when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sat down
together, Peter sat down among them. But a certain maid beheld him as he
sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was
also with him. And he denied Him, saying, Woman, I know Him not. And
after a little while, another saw him, and said, “Thou art also of
them.” <span id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309.md) Now the clause, “And
after a little while,” which Luke introduces, covers the period during
which \[we may suppose that\] Peter went out and the first cock crew. By
this time, however, he had come in again; and thus we can understand the
consistency of John’s narrative, which informs us that he denied the
Lord the second time as he stood by the fire. For in his version of
Peter’s first denial, John not only says nothing about the first crowing
of the cock (which holds good of the other evangelists, too, with the
exception of Mark), but also leaves unnoticed the fact that it was as he
sat by the fire that the maid recognised him. For all that John says
there is this, “Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art
not thou also one of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.” <span
id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310.md) Then he brings in the statement
which he deemed it right to make on the subject of what took place with
Jesus in that same house. His record of this is to the following effect:
“And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of
coals, for it was cold. And they warmed themselves; and Peter stood with
them, and warmed himself.” <span id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311.md)
Here, therefore, we may suppose Peter to have gone out, and by this time
to have come in again. For at first he was sitting by the fire; and
after a space, as we gather, he had returned, and commenced to stand
\[by the hearth\].

<span id="vi.vi.vii-p32"></span>24. It may be, however, that some one
will say to us: Peter had not actually gone out as yet, but had only
risen with the purpose of going out. This may be the allegation of one
who is of opinion that the second interrogation and denial took place
when Peter was outside at the door. Let us therefore look at what
follows in John’s narrative. It is to this effect: “The high priest then
asked Jesus of His disciples, and of His doctrine. Jesus answered him, I
spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the
temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said
nothing. Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me what I have said
unto them: behold, they know what I said. And when He had <span
id="page_187">p. 187</span> <span id="vi.vi.vii-Page_187"></span>thus
spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of
his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? Jesus answered him,
If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why
smitest thou me? And Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high
priest.” <span id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312.md) This certainly shows
us that Annas was high priest. For Jesus had not been sent to Caiaphas
as yet, when the question was thus put to Him, “Answerest thou the high
priest so?” Mention is also made of Annas and Caiaphas as high priests
by Luke at the beginning of his Gospel. <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313.md) After these statements, John
reverts to the account which he had previously begun of Peter’s denial.
Thus he brings us back to the house in which the incidents took place
which he has recorded, and from which Jesus was sent away to Caiaphas,
to whom He was being conducted at the commencement of this scene, as
Matthew has informed us. <span id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md)
Moreover, it is in the way of a recapitulation that John records the
matters regarding Peter which he has introduced at this point. Falling
back upon his narration of that incident with the view of making up a
complete account of the threefold denial, he proceeds thus: “And Simon
stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou
also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.” <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md) Here, therefore, we find that
Peter’s second denial occurred, not when he was at the door, but as he
was standing by the fire. This, however, could not have been the case,
had he not returned by this time after having gone outside. For it is
not that by this second occasion he had actually gone out, and that the
other maid who is referred to saw him there outside; but the matter is
put as if it was on his going out that she saw him; or, in other words,
it was when he rose to go out that she observed him, and said to those
who were there,—that is, to those who were gathered by the fire inside,
within the court,—“This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.” Then we
are to suppose that the man who had thus gone outside, on hearing this
assertion, came in again, and swore to those who were now inimically
disposed, “I do not know the man.” <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316.md) In like manner, Mark also says of
this same maid, that “she began to say to them that stood by, This is
one of them.” <span id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317.md) For this damsel
was speaking not to Peter, but to those who had remained there when he
went out. At the same time, she spoke in such a manner that he heard her
words; whereupon he came back and stood again by the fire, and met their
words with a negative. Then we have the statement made by John in these
terms: “They said, Art not thou also one of his disciples?” We
understand this question to have been addressed to him on his return as
he stood there; and we also recognise the harmony in which this stands
with the position that on this occasion Peter had to do not only with
that other maid who is mentioned by Matthew and Mark in connection with
this second denial, but also with that other person who is introduced by
Luke. This is the reason why John uses the plural, “They said.” The
explanation then may be, that when the maid said to those who were with
her in the court as he went out, “This is one of them,” he heard her
words and returned with the purpose of clearing himself, as it were, by
a denial. Or, in accordance with the more probable theory, we may
suppose that he did not catch what was said about him as he went out,
and that on his return the maid and the other person who is introduced
by Luke addressed him thus, “Art not thou also one of his disciples?”
that he met them with a denial, “and said, I am not;” and further, that
when this other person of whom Luke speaks insisted more pertinaciously,
and said, “Surely thou art one of them,” Peter answered thus, “Man, I am
not.” Still, when we compare together all the statements made by the
several evangelists on this subject, we come clearly to the conclusion,
that Peter’s second denial took place, not when he was at the door, but
when he was within, by the fire in the court. It becomes evident,
therefore, that Matthew and Mark, who have told us how he went without,
have left the fact of his return unnoticed simply with a view to
brevity.

<span id="vi.vi.vii-p39"></span>25. Accordingly, let us next examine
into the consistency of the evangelists so far as the third denial is
concerned, which we have previously instanced in the statement given by
Matthew only. Mark then goes on with his version in these terms: “And a
little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art
one of them; for thou art a Galilæan. But he began to curse and to
swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak. And immediately the
second time the cock crew.” <span id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318.md)
Luke, again, continues his narrative, relating the same incident in this
fashion: “And about the space of one hour after, another confidently
affirmed, Of a truth this fellow also was with him; for he is a
Galilæan. And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And
immediately while he yet spake the cock crew.” <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319.md) John follows with his account of
Peter’s third denial, which is thus <span id="page_188">p. 188</span>
<span id="vi.vi.vii-Page_188"></span>given: “One of the servants of the
high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I
see thee in the garden with him? Peter then denied again; and
immediately the cock crew.” <span id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320.md)
Now what precise period of time is meant under the phrase, “a little
after,” which is employed by Matthew and Mark, is made clear by Luke,
when he says, “And about the space of one hour after.” John, however,
conveys no intimation of this space of time. Again, with respect to the
circumstance that Matthew and Mark use the plural number instead of the
singular, and speak of the persons who were engaged with Peter, while
Luke mentions only a single individual, and John, too, specifies but
one, particularizing him further as kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut
off; we may easily explain it either by understanding Matthew and Mark
to have adopted a familiar method of speech here in employing the plural
number simply instead of the singular, or by supposing that one of the
persons present—one who knew Peter and had seen him—took the lead in
making the declaration, and that the rest, imitating his confidence,
joined him in pressing the assertion upon Peter. If this is the case,
then two of the evangelists have given the general statement, using
simply the plural number; while the other two have preferred to
particularize only the one special individual who played the chief part
in the transaction. But, once more, Matthew affirms that the words,
“Surely thou also art one of them, for thy speech bewrayeth thee,” were
spoken to Peter himself. In like manner, John tells us that the
question, “Did not I see thee in the garden with him?” was addressed
directly to Peter. But Mark, on the other hand, gives us to understand
that the sentence, “Surely he is one of them, for he is also a
Galilæan,” was what those who stood by said to each other about Peter.
And, in the same way, Luke indicates that the declaration uttered by the
other person, who said, “Of a truth, this fellow also was with him, for
he is a Galilæan,” was not addressed to Peter, but was made regarding
Peter. These variations, however, may be explained either by
understanding the evangelists, who speak of Peter as the person directly
addressed, to have fairly reproduced the general sense, inasmuch as what
was spoken about the man in his own presence was much the same as if it
had been spoken immediately to him; or by supposing that both these
methods of address were actually practised, and that the one has been
noticed by the former evangelists, and the other by the latter.
Moreover, we take the second cockcrowing to have occurred after the
third denial, as Mark has expressly informed us.

<span id="vi.vi.vii-p43"></span>26. Matthew then proceeds with his
narrative in these terms: “And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which
He had said unto him, Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice.
And he went out and wept bitterly.” <span
id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md) Mark, again, gives it thus: “And
Peter called to mind the word that Jesus had said unto him, Before the
cock crow twice thou shall deny me thrice. And he began to weep.” <span
id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md) Luke’s version is as follows: “And
the Lord turned and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of
the Lord, how He had said unto him, Before the cock crow thou shalt deny
me thrice. And Peter went out and wept bitterly.” <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323.md) John says nothing about Peter’s
recollection and weeping. Now, the statement made here by Luke, to the
effect that “the Lord turned and looked upon Peter,” is one which
requires more careful consideration, with a view to its correct
acceptance. For although there are also inner halls (or courts), so
named, it was in the outer court (or hall) that Peter appeared on this
occasion among the servants, who were warming themselves along with him
at the fire. And it is not a credible supposition that Jesus was heard
by the Jews in this place, so that we might also understand the *look*
referred to to have been a look with the bodily eye. For Matthew
presents us first with this narrative: “Then did they spit in His face
and buffeted Him; and others smote Him with the palms of their hands,
saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, who is he that smote thee?” <span
id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324.md) And then he follows this up
immediately with the paragraph about Peter: “Now Peter sat without in
the palace.” <span id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325.md) He would not,
however, have used this latter expression, had it not been the case that
the things previously alluded to were done to the Lord inside the house.
And, indeed, as we gather from Mark’s version, these things took place
not simply in the interior, but also in the upper parts of the house.
For, after recording the said circumstances, Mark goes on thus: “And as
Peter was beneath in the palace.” <span
id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326.md) Thus, as Matthew’s words, “Now
Peter sat without in the palace,” show us that the things previously
mentioned took place inside the house, so Mark’s words, “And as Peter
was beneath in the palace,” indicate that they were done not only in the
interior, but in the upper parts of the house. But if this is the case,
how could the Lord have looked on Peter with the actual glance of the
bodily eye? These considerations bring <span id="page_189">p. 189</span>
<span id="vi.vi.vii-Page_189"></span>me to the conclusion, that the look
in question was one cast upon Peter from Heaven, the effect of which was
to bring up before his mind the number of times he had now denied \[his
Master\], and the declaration which the Lord had made to him
prophetically, and in this way (the Lord thus looking mercifully upon
him <span id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327) .md), to lead him to repent,
and to weep salutary tears. The expression, therefore, will be a
parallel to other modes of speech which we employ daily, as when we thus
pray, “Lord, look upon me;” or as when, in reference to one who has been
delivered by the divine mercy from some danger or trouble, we say that
the “Lord looked upon him.” In the Scriptures, also, we find such words
as these: “Look upon me and hear me;” <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328.md) and “Return, <span
id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329.md) O Lord, and deliver my soul.” <span
id="fr_1330"></span>[1331](#fn_1330.md) And, according to my judgment, a
similar view is to be taken of the expression adopted here, when it is
said that “the Lord turned and looked upon Peter; and Peter remembered
the word of the Lord.” Finally, we have to notice how, while it is the
more usual practice with the evangelists to employ the name “Jesus” in
preference to the word “Lord” in their narratives, Luke has used the
latter term exclusively in the said sentence, saying expressly, “The
‘Lord’ turned and looked upon Peter; and Peter remembered the word of
the ‘Lord:’” whereas Matthew and Mark have passed over this “look” in
silence, and consequently have said that Peter remembered not the word
of the “Lord,” but the word of “Jesus.” From this, therefore, we may
gather that the “look” thus proceeding from Jesus was not one with the
eyes of the human body, but a look cast from Heaven. <span
