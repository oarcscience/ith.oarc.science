<span id="vi.vi.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.i-p1.1"></span>Prologue.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vi.vi.i-p2.1"></span>Inasmuch</span> as we have now reached that
point in the history at which all the four evangelists necessarily hold
their course in company on to the conclusion, without presenting any
serious divergence the one from the other, if it happens anywhere that
one of them makes mention of something which another leaves unnoticed,
it appears to me that we may demonstrate the consistency maintained by
the various evangelists with greater expedition, if from this point
onwards we now bring all the statements given by all the writers
together into one connection, and arrange the whole in a single
narration, and under one view. <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228.md) I consider that in this way the
task which we have undertaken may be discharged with greater convenience
and facility than otherwise might be the case. What we have now before
us, therefore, is to attempt the construction of a single narrative, in
which we shall include all the particulars, and for which we shall
possess the attestation of those evangelists who, (each selecting for
recital out of the whole number of facts those which he had either the
ability or the desire to relate,) have prepared these records for
us: <span id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229.md) this being done in such a
manner, moreover, that all these statements, in regard to which we have
to prove an entire freedom from contradictions, are taken as made by all
the evangelists together.
