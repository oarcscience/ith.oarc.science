<span id="vi.v.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—Of the Man with the Withered
Hand, Who Was Restored on the Sabbath-Day; And of the Question as to How
Matthew’s Narrative of This Incident Can Be Harmonized with Those of
Mark and Luke, Either in the Matter of the Order of Events, or in the
Report of the Words Spoken by the Lord and by the Jews.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxxvi-p2"></span>82. Matthew continues his account thus:
“And when He was departed thence, He went into their synagogue: and,
behold, there was a man which had his hand withered;” and so on, down to
the words, “And it was restored whole, like as the other.” <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[1003](#fn_1002.md) The restoring of this man who had
the withered hand is also not passed over in silence by Mark and
Luke. <span id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003.md) Now, the circumstance
that this day is also designated a Sabbath might possibly lead us to
suppose that both the plucking of the ears of corn and the healing of
this man took place on the same day, were it not <span id="page_141">p.
141</span> <span id="vi.v.xxxvi-Page_141"></span>that Luke has made it
plain that it was on a different Sabbath that the cure of the withered
hand was wrought. Accordingly, when Matthew says, “And when He was
departed thence, He came into their synagogue,” the words do indeed
import that the said coming did not take place until after He had
departed from the previously mentioned locality; but, at the same time,
they leave the question undecided as to the number of days which may
have elapsed between His passing from the aforesaid corn-field and His
coming into their synagogue; and they express nothing as to His going
there in direct and immediate succession. And thus space is offered us
for getting in the narrative of Luke, who tells us that it was on
another Sabbath that this man’s hand was restored. But it is possible
that a difficulty may be felt in the circumstance that Matthew has told
us how the people put this question to the Lord, “Is it lawful to heal
on the Sabbath-day?” wishing thereby to find an occasion for accusing
Him; and that in reply He set before them the parable of the sheep in
these terms: “What man shall there be among you that shall have one
sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath-day, will he not lay
hold on it and lift it out? How much, then, is a man better than a
sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath-days;” <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[1005](#fn_1004.md) whereas Mark and Luke rather
represent the people to have had this question put to them by the Lord,
“Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath-day, or to do evil? to save
life, or to kill?” <span id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005.md) We solve
this difficulty, however, by the supposition that the people in the
first instance asked the Lord, “Is it lawful to heal on the
Sabbath-day?” that thereupon, knowing the thoughts of the men who were
thus seeking an occasion for accusing Him, He set the man whom He had
been on the point of healing in their midst, and addressed to them the
interrogations which Mark and Luke mention to have been put; that, as
they remained silent, He next put before them the parable of the sheep,
and drew the conclusion that it was lawful to do good on the
Sabbath-day; and that, finally, when He had looked round about on them
with anger, as Mark tells us, being grieved for the hardness of their
hearts, He said to the man, “Stretch forth thine hand.”
