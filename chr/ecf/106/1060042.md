<span id="v.iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xii-p2"></span>40. There follows a precept concerning
fasting, having reference to that same purification of heart which is at
present under discussion. For in this work also we must be on our guard,
lest there should creep in a certain ostentation and hankering after the
praise of man, which would make the heart double, and not allow it to be
pure and single for apprehending God. “Moreover, when ye fast,” says He,
“be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure
their faces, <span id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md) that they may
appear <span id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md) unto men to fast. Verily
I say unto you, they have their reward. But ye, <span
id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md) when ye fast, anoint your head, and
wash your face; that ye appear not unto men to fast, but unto your
Father which is in secret: and your Father, which seeth in secret, shall
reward you.” It is manifest from these precepts that all our effort is
to be directed towards inward joys, lest, seeking a reward from without,
we should be conformed to this world, and should lose the promise of a
blessedness so much the more solid and firm, as it is inward, in which
God has chosen that we should become conformed to the image of His
Son. <span id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md)

<span id="v.iii.xii-p7"></span>41. But in this section it is chiefly to
be noticed, that there may be ostentatious display not merely in the
splendour and pomp of things pertaining to the booty, but also in
doleful squalor itself; and the more dangerous on this account, that it
deceives under the name of serving God. And therefore he who is very
conspicuous by immoderate attention to the body, and by the splendour of
his clothing or other things, is easily convicted by the things
themselves of being a follower of the pomps of the world, and misleads
no one by a cunning semblance of sanctity; but in regard to him who
under a profession of Christianity, fixes the eyes of men upon himself
by unusual squalor and filth, when he does it voluntarily, and not under
the pressure of necessity, it may be conjectured from the rest of his
actings whether he does this from contempt of superfluous attention to
the body, or from a certain ambition: for the Lord has enjoined us to
beware of wolves under a sheep’s skin; but “by their fruits,” says He,
“shall ye know them.” For when by temptations of any kind those very
things begin to be withdrawn from them or refused to them, which under
that veil they either have obtained or desire to obtain, then of
necessity it appears whether it is a wolf in a sheep’s skin or a sheep
in its own. For a Christian ought not to delight the eyes of men by
superfluous ornament on this account, because pretenders also too often
assume that frugal and merely necessary dress, that they may deceive
those who are not on their guard: for those sheep also ought not to lay
aside their own skins, if at any time wolves cover themselves there
with.

<span id="v.iii.xii-p8"></span>42. It is usual, therefore, to ask what
He means, when He says: “But ye, when ye fast, anoint your head, and
wash your faces, that ye appear not unto men to fast.” For it would not
be right in any one to teach (although we may wash our face according to
daily custom) that we ought also to have our heads anointed when we
fast. If, then, all admit this to be most unseemly, we must understand
this precept with respect to anointing the head and washing the face as
referring to the inner man. <span id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md)
Hence, to anoint the head refers to joy; to wash the face, on the other
hand, refers to purity: and therefore that man anoints his head who
rejoices inwardly in his mind and reason. For we rightly understand that
as being the head which has the pre-eminence in the soul, and by which
it is evident that the other parts of man are ruled and governed. And
this is done by him who does not seek his joy from without, so as to
draw his delight in a fleshly way from the praises of men. For the
flesh, which ought to be subject, is in no way the head of the whole
nature of man. “No man,” indeed, “ever yet hated his own flesh,” as the
apostle says, when giving the precept as to loving one’s wife; <span
id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) but the man is the head of the woman,
and Christ is the head of the man. <span
id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) Let him, therefore, rejoice inwardly
in his fasting <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) in this very
circumstance, that by his fasting he so turns away from the pleasure of
the world as to be subject to Christ, who according to this precept
desires to have the head anointed. For thus also he will wash his face,
*i.e.* cleanse his heart, with which he shall see God, no veil being
interposed on account of the infirmity contracted from squalor; but
being firm and stedfast, inasmuch as he is pure and guileless. “Wash
you,” says He, “make <span id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span
id="v.iii.xii-Page_48"></span>you clean; put away the evil of your
doings from before mine eyes.” <span id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md)
From the squalor, therefore, by which the eye of God is offended, our
face is to be washed. For we, with open face beholding as in a glass the
glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image. <span
id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md)

<span id="v.iii.xii-p15"></span>43. Often also the thought of things
necessary belonging to this life wounds and defiles our inner eye; and
frequently it makes the heart double, so that in regard to those things
in which we seem to act rightly with our fellowmen, we do not act with
that heart wherewith the Lord enjoins us; *i.e.*, it is not because we
love them, but because we wish to obtain some advantage from them for
the necessity of the present life. But we ought to do them good for
their eternal salvation, not for our own temporal advantage. May God,
therefore, incline our heart to His testimonies, and not to
covetousness. <span id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) For “the end of
the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good
conscience, and of faith unfeigned.” <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md) But he who looks after his brother
from a regard to his own necessities in this life, does not certainly do
so from love, because he does not look after him whom he ought to love
as himself, but after himself; or rather not even after himself, seeing
that in this way he makes his own heart double, by which he is hindered
from seeing God, in the vision of whom alone there is certain and
lasting blessedness.

The Pharisees were scrupulous in keeping fast-days. Monday and Thursday
were observed by the strict with different degrees of scrupulosity,—the
lowest admitting of washing and anointing the head. (See Schürer, *N.
Zeitgesch*. p. 505 sqq.). The early practice of fasting in the
sub-apostolic Church is evident from the *Teaching of the Twelve
Apostles*, which enjoins it before baptism, and on the “fourth day and
the Preparation Day” (vii., viii.).
