<span id="v.ii.xxiii"></span>

<span id="v.ii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.</span>

<span id="v.ii.xxiii-p2"></span>78. Then, as to the statement which
follows, “that ye may be the children of your Father which is in
heaven,” <span id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) it is to be understood
according to that rule in virtue of which John also says, “He gave them
power to become the sons of God.” <span
id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) For one is a Son by nature, who knows
nothing at all of sin; but we, by receiving power, are made sons, in as
far as we perform those things which are commanded us by Him. And hence
the apostolic teaching gives the name of adoption to that by which we
are called to an eternal inheritance, that we may be joint-heirs with
Christ. <span id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) We are therefore made
sons by a spiritual regeneration, and we are adopted into the kingdom of
God, not as aliens, but as being made and created by Him: so that it is
one benefit, His having brought us into being through His omnipotence,
when before we were nothing; another, His having adopted us, so that, as
being sons, we might enjoy along with Him eternal life for our
participation. Therefore He does not say, Do those things, because ye
are sons; but, Do those things, that ye may be sons.

<span id="v.ii.xxiii-p6"></span>79. But when He calls us to this by the
Only-begotten Himself, He calls us to His own likeness. For He, as is
said in what follows, “maketh <span id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md)
His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the
just and on the unjust.” Whether you are to understand His sun as being
not that which is visible to the fleshly eyes, but that wisdom of which
it is said, “She is the brightness of the everlasting light;” <span
id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) of which it is also said, “The Sun of
righteousness has arisen upon me;” and again, “But unto you that fear
the name of the Lord shall the Sun of righteousness arise:” <span
id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) so that you would also understand the
rain as being the watering with the doctrine of truth, because Christ
hath appeared to the good and the evil, and is preached to the good and
the evil. Or whether you choose rather to understand that sun which is
set forth before the bodily eyes not only of men, but also of cattle;
and that rain by which the fruits are brought forth, which have been
given for the refreshment of the body, which I think is the more
probable interpretation: so that that spiritual sun does not rise except
on the good and holy; for it is this very thing which the wicked bewail
in that book which is called the Wisdom of Solomon, “And the sun rose
not upon us:” <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) and that spiritual
rain does not water any except the good; for the wicked were meant by
the vineyard of which <span id="page_33">p. 33</span> <span
id="v.ii.xxiii-Page_33"></span>it is said, “I will also command my
clouds that they rain no rain upon it.” <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) But whether you understand the one or
the other, it takes place by the great goodness of God, which we are
commanded to imitate, if we wish to be the children of God. For who is
there so ungrateful as not to feel how great the comfort, so far as this
life is concerned, which that visible light and the material rain bring?
And this comfort we see bestowed in this life alike upon the righteous
and upon sinners in common. But He does not say, “who maketh the sun to
rise on the evil and on the good;” but He has added the word “His,”
*i.e.* which He Himself made and established, and for the making of
which He took nothing from any one, as it is written in Genesis
respecting all the luminaries; <span id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md)
and He can properly say that all the things which He has created out of
nothing are His own: so that we are hence admonished with how great
liberality we ought, according to His precept, to give to our enemies
those things which we have not created, but have received from His
gifts.

<span id="v.ii.xxiii-p13"></span>80. But who can either be prepared to
bear injuries from the weak, in as far as it is profitable for their
salvation; and to choose rather to suffer more injustice from another
than to repay what he has suffered; to give to every one that asketh
anything from him, either what he asks, if it is in his possession, and
if it can rightly be given, or good advice, or to manifest a benevolent
disposition, and not to turn away from him who desires to borrow; to
love his enemies, to do good to those who hate him, to pray for those
who persecute him;—who, I say, does these things, but the man who is
fully and perfectly merciful? <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md)
And with that counsel misery is avoided, by the assistance of Him who
says, “I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.” <span
id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) “Blessed,” therefore, “are the
merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.” But now I think it will be more
convenient, that at this point the reader, fatigued with so long a
volume, should breathe a little, and recruit himself for considering
what remains in another book.

<span id="v.ii.xxiii-p14"></span> “Be ye therefore perfect, as your
heavenly Father is perfect.” The Greek text has here the future: <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.xxiii-p14.1"></span>ἐσεσθε τέλειοι</span>,
“Ye therefore shall be perfect” (Revised Version). Meyer gives the verb
the imperative sense; Alford, Lange, and others include the imperative
sense. The imperative force adds not a little to the plausibility of
deriving the doctrine of perfectibility on earth, or complete
“sanctification,” from the passage, as the Pelagians (whom Augustin
elsewhere combats) and some Methodist commentators (Whedon, etc.).
Alford, Trench, etc., deny that the verse gives any countenance to the
doctrine. As regards the nature of the perfection, Bengel sententiously
says, “*in amore, erga omnes*” (“in love, toward all.” See [Col. iii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014.md)<span
id="v.ii.xxiii-p14.2"></span>). It seems “to refer chiefly to the
perfection of the divine love” (Mansel); so also Bleek, Meyer. Weiss
(whose *Leben Jesu*, i. 532–534, see) finds an allusion to the
fundamental command of the Old Testament, “Be ye holy,” etc. In the
place of the divine holiness, or God’s elevation above all uncleanness
of the creature, is substituted the divine perfection, whose essence is
all-comprehensive and unselfish love; and in the place of the God
separated from the sinful people, appears He who in love condescends to
them and brings them into likeness with Himself as His children. The
last verse of the Sermon as reported by [Luke
6.36](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#036.md)<span
id="v.ii.xxiii-p14.3"></span> confirms the idea that the perfection is
of love: “Be ye merciful, as your Father which is in heaven is
merciful.” Commenting on this verse, Dr. Schaff says, “Instruction in
morality cannot rise above this. Having thus led us up to our heavenly
Father as the true standard, our Lord, by a natural transition, passes
to our religious duties, *i.e.* duties to our heavenly Father.”
