<span id="vi.v.lxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIX.—Of the Harmony Between the First
Three Evangelists in Their Accounts of the Occasion on Which the Jews
Asked the Lord by What Authority He Did These Things.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxx-p2"></span>132. Matthew continues his narrative in
the following terms: “And when He was come into the temple, the chief
priests and the elders of the people came unto Him as He was teaching,
and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee
this authority? And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask
you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what
authority I do these things. The baptism of John, whence was it?” and so
on, down to the words, “Neither tell I you by what authority I do these
things.” <span id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146.md) The other two, Mark
and Luke, have also set forth this whole passage, and that, too, in
almost as many words. <span id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147.md) Neither
does there appear to be any discrepancy between them in regard to the
order, the only exception being found in the circumstance of which I
have spoken above,—namely, that Matthew omits certain matters belonging
to a different day, and has constructed his narrative with a connection
which, were our attention not called \[otherwise\] to the fact, might
lead to the supposition that he was still treating of the second day,
where Mark deals with the third. Moreover, Luke has not appended his
notice of this incident, as if he meant to go over the days in orderly
succession; but after recording the expulsion of the sellers and buyers
from the temple, he has passed by without notice all that is contained
in the statements above—His going out into Bethany, and His returning to
the city, and what was done to the fig-tree, and the reply touching the
power of faith which was made to the disciples when they marvelled. And
then, after all these omissions, he has introduced the next section of
his narrative in these terms: “And He taught daily in the temple. But
the chief priests, and the scribes, and the chief of the people sought
to destroy Him; and could not find what they might do: for all the
people were very attentive to hear Him. And it came to pass, that on one
of these days, as He taught the people in the temple, and preached the
gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon Him, with the
elders, and spake unto Him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest
thou these things?” and so on; all which the other two evangelists
record in like manner. From this it is apparent that he is in no
antagonism with the others, even with regard to the order; since what he
states to have taken place “on one of those days,” may be understood to
belong to that particular day on which they also have reported it to
have occurred. <span id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148.md)

day of public controversy in the temple presents few difficulties. It
was probably the Tuesday of Passion Week. The day of the month is in
dispute because of the still mooted question, whether our Lord ate the
last passover at the regular time or one day earlier.—R.\]
