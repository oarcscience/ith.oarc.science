<span id="vii.xx-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.xx-p1.1"></span>Sermon XVIII.</span>

<span id="vii.xx-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.xx-p2.1"></span>\[LXVIII. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.xx-p3"></span>*Again on the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xx-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. xi.
25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md)<span id="vii.xx-p3.2"></span>, “I
thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth,” etc.*

<span id="vii.xx-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xx-p4.1"></span>We</span> have heard the Son of God saying, “I
confess to Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth.” What doth he
confess to Him? Wherein doth he praise Him? “Because Thou hast hid these
things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
babes.” <span id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md) Who are the “wise and
prudent”? Who the “babes”? What hath He hid from the wise and prudent,
and revealed unto babes? By the “wise and prudent,” He signifieth those
of whom St. Paul speaks; “Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where
is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of
this <span id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span
id="vii.xx-Page_314"></span>world?” <span
id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288.md) Yet perhaps thou still askest who
they are. They are they peradventure who in their much disputation
concerning God, have spoken falsely of Him; who, puffed up by their own
doctrines, could in no wise find out and know God, and who for the God
whose substance is incomprehensible and invisible, have thought the air
and sky to be God, or the sun to be God, or anything which holds high
place <span id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289.md) among the creatures to
be God. For observing the grandeur and beauty and powers of the
creatures, they rested in them, and found not the Creator.

<span id="vii.xx-p8"></span>2. These men does the Book of wisdom
reprove, where it is said, “For if they were able to know so much as to
aim at the world, how did they not sooner find out the Lord
thereof?” <span id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290.md) They are accused as
wasting their time and their busy disputes in investigating and
measuring as it were the creature; they sought out the courses of the
stars, the intervals of the planets, the movements <span
id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291.md) of the heavenly bodies, so as to
arrive by certain <span id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292.md)
calculations to that degree of knowledge as to foretell the eclipses of
the sun and moon; and that as they had foretold, so should the event be
according to the day and hour, and to the portion of the bodies which
should be eclipsed. Great industry, great activity of mind. But in these
things they sought after the Creator, who was not far off from them, and
they found Him not. Whom if they could have found, they might have had
within them. With the best reason then, and very rightly were they
accused, who could investigate the numbers of the stars, and their
varied movements, and know and foretell the eclipses of the luminaries:
rightly accused, I say, in that they found not Him by whom these had
been created and ordained, because they neglected to seek Him. But be
not thou much disquieted, if thou art ignorant of the courses of the
stars, and the proportions <span id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293.md) of
the celestial and terrestrial bodies. Behold the fair beauty of the
world, and praise its Creator’s counsel. Behold what He has made, and
love Him who made it: be this thy greatest care. Love Him who made it;
for He made thee also after His own image, that thou mightest love Him.

<span id="vii.xx-p13"></span>3. If then it is strange that those things
of which Christ said, “Thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent,” were hidden from such wise men as these, who, occupied wholly
about the creatures, chose to seek the Creator carelessly, and could not
find Him; still more strange is it that there should even be found some
“wise and prudent” men who were able to know Him. “For the wrath of God
is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of
men who hold the truth in unrighteousness.” <span
id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294.md) Perhaps thou dost ask, what truth
do they hold in unrighteousness? “Because that which may be known of God
is manifest among them.” How is it manifest? He goes on to say, “For God
hath manifested it to them.” <span id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295.md)
Dost thou still enquire how He manifested it to them to whom He gave not
the law? How? “For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the
world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
made.” <span id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296.md) There were then some
such, not as Moses the servant of God, not as many Prophets who had an
insight into and knowledge of these things, and were aided by the Spirit
of God, which they drew in by faith, and drank with the throat <span
id="fr_2297"></span>[2298](#fn_2297.md) of godliness, and poured <span
id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298.md) forth again by the mouth of the
interior man. Not such as these were they; but far unlike them, who by
means of this visible creation were able to attain to the understanding
of the Creator, and to say of these things which God hath made; <span
id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299.md) Behold what things He hath made, He
governeth and containeth also. He who hath made them, Himself filleth
what He hath made with His own presence. Thus much they were enabled to
say. For these Paul also made mention of in the Acts of the Apostles,
where, when he had said of God, “For in Him we live and move and have
our being” <span id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300.md) (forasmuch as he
was speaking to the Athenians among whom those learned men had existed);
he subjoined immediately; “As certain also of your own have said.” Now
it was no trivial thing they said; “That in Him we live and move and
have our being.”

<span id="vii.xx-p21"></span>4. In what then were they unlike the
others? why were they blamed? why rightly accused? Hear the words of the
Apostle which I had begun to quote; “The wrath of God,” saith he, “is
revealed from heaven against all ungodliness” (even of those, namely,
who had not received the law); “against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.” What
truth? “Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them.” By
whose manifestation of it? “For God hath manifested it to them.” How?
“For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His
Eternal Power and Godhead.” Why did He manifest it? “That they might be
without excuse.” Wherein then are they to be blamed? “Because that when
they knew God, they glorified Him not as God.”

<span id="vii.xx-p22"></span>5. What mean these words, “Glorified Him
not as God?” They did not give Him thanks. <span id="page_315">p.
315</span> <span id="vii.xx-Page_315"></span>Is this then to glorify
God; to give God thanks? Yes, verily. For what can be worse, if having
been created after the image of God, and having come to know God, thou
shalt not be thankful to Him? This surely, this is to glorify God, to
give God thanks. The faithful know where and when it is said, “Let us
give thanks unto our Lord God.” But who gives thanks to God, save he who
“lifts up his heart unto the Lord?” Therefore are they blameable and
without excuse, “Because when they knew God, they glorified Him not as
God, nor gave Him thanks. But”—what? “But they became vain in their
imaginations.” Whence did they become vain, but because they were proud?
Thus smoke vanishes away by rising up aloft, and a flame burns the more
brightly and strongly in proportion as it is kept <span
id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301.md) low; “They became vain in their
imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.” So smoke, though it
rise higher than the flame, is dark.

<span id="vii.xx-p24"></span>6. Finally, mark what follows, and see the
point on which the whole matter depends. “For professing themselves to
be wise, they became fools.” For arrogating to themselves what God had
given, God took away what He had given. Therefore from the proud He hid
Himself, who conveyed the knowledge of Himself only to those who through
the creature sought diligently after the Creator. Well then did our Lord
say, “Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent;” whether
from those who in their manifold disputations, and most busy search,
have reached to the full investigation of the creature, but knew nothing
of the Creator, or from them who when they knew God, glorified Him not
as God, nor gave Him thanks, and who could not see perfectly or
healthfully because they were proud. “Therefore Thou hast hid these
things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.”
What babes? To the lowly. Say on whom doth My Spirit rest? “Upon him
that is lowly and quiet, and who trembleth at My words.” <span
id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302.md) At these words Peter trembled;
Plato trembled not. Let the fisherman hold fast what that most famous
philosopher has lost. “Thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.” Thou hast hid them from the
proud, and revealed them to the humble. What things are these? For when
He said this, He did not intend the heaven and earth, or point them out
as it were with His hand as He spake. For these who does not see? The
good see them, the bad see them; for He “maketh His sun to rise on the
evil and the good.” <span id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303.md) What then
are these things? “All things are delivered unto Me of My Father.” <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304.md)
