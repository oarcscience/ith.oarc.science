<span id="vi.v.xlix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII.—Of the Absence of Any
Discrepancy Between Matthew and Mark on the One Hand, and John on the
Other, in the Accounts Which the Three Give Together of What Took Place
After the Other Side of the Lake Was Reached.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xlix-p2"></span>102. Matthew proceeds as follows: “And
when they were gone over, they came into the land of Genesar. And when
the men of that place had knowledge of Him, they sent out unto all that
country round about, and brought unto Him all that were diseased, and
besought Him that they might only touch the hem of His garment: and as
many as touched were made perfectly whole. Then came to Him scribes and
Pharisees from Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the
tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat
bread,” and so on, down to the words, “But to eat with unwashen hands
defileth not a man.” <span id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md) This is
also related by Mark, in a way which precludes the raising of any
question about discrepancies. For anything expressed here by the one in
a form differing from that used by the other, involves at least no
departure from identity in sense. John, on the other hand, fixing his
attention, as his wont is, upon the Lord’s discourses, passes on from
the notice of the ship, which the Lord reached by walking upon the
waters, to what took place after they disembarked upon the land, and
mentions that He took occasion from the eating of the bread to deliver
many lessons, dealing pre-eminently with divine things. After this
address, too, his narrative is again borne on to one subject after
another, in a sublime strain. <span id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md)
At the same time, this transition which he thus makes to different
themes does not involve any real want of harmony, although he exhibits
certain divergencies from these others, with the order of events
presented by the rest of the evangelists. For what is there to hinder us
from supposing at once that those persons, whose story is given by
Matthew and Mark, were healed by the Lord, and that He delivered this
discourse which John recounts to the people who followed Him across the
sea? Such a supposition is made all the more reasonable by the fact that
Capharnaum, to which place they are said, according to John, to have
crossed, is near the lake of Genesar; and that, again, is the district
into which they came, according to Matthew, on landing.
