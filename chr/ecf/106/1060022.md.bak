<span id="v.ii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.</span>

<span id="v.ii.xvi-p2"></span>43. Here there arises a second question,
when the Lord allows a wife to be put away for the cause of fornication,
in what latitude of meaning fornication is to be understood in this
passage,—whether in the sense understood by all, viz. that we are to
understand that fornication to be meant which is committed in acts of
uncleanness; or whether, in accordance <span id="page_19">p. 19</span>
<span id="v.ii.xvi-Page_19"></span>with the usage of Scripture in
speaking of fornication (as has been mentioned above), as meaning all
unlawful corruption, such as idolatry or covetousness, and therefore, of
course, every transgression of the law on account of the unlawful lust
\[involved in it\]. <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) But let us
consult the apostle, that we may not say rashly. “And unto the married I
command,” says he, “yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart
from her husband: but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be
reconciled to her husband.” For it may happen that she departs for that
cause for which the Lord gives permission to do so. Or, if a woman is at
liberty to put away her husband for other causes besides that of
fornication, and the husband is not at liberty, what answer shall we
give respecting this statement which he has made afterwards, “And let
not the husband put away his wife”? Wherefore did he not add, saving for
the cause of fornication, which the Lord permits, unless because he
wishes a similar rule to be understood, that if he shall put away his
wife (which he is permitted to do for the cause of fornication), he is
to remain without a wife, or be reconciled to his wife? For it would not
be a bad thing for a husband to be reconciled to such a woman as that to
whom, when nobody had dared to stone her, the Lord said, “Go, and sin no
more.” <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) And for this reason also,
because He who says, It is not lawful to put away one’s wife saving for
the cause of fornication, forces him to retain his wife, if there should
be no cause of fornication: but if there should be, He does not force
him to put her away, but permits him, just as when it is said, Let it
not be lawful for a woman to marry another, unless her husband be dead;
if she shall marry before the death of her husband, she is guilty; if
she shall not marry after the death of her husband, she is not guilty,
for she is not commanded to marry, but merely permitted. If, therefore,
there is a like rule in the said law of marriage between man and woman,
to such an extent that not merely of the woman has the same apostle
said, “The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband;” but he
has not been silent respecting him, saying, “And likewise also the
husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife;”—if, then, the
rule is similar, there is no necessity for understanding that it is
lawful for a woman to put away her husband, saving for the cause of
fornication, as is the case also with the husband.

<span id="v.ii.xvi-p5"></span>44. It is therefore to be considered in
what latitude of meaning we ought to understand the word fornication,
and the apostle is to be consulted, as we were beginning to do. For he
goes on to say, “But to the rest speak I, not the Lord.” Here, first, we
must see who are “the rest,” for he was speaking before on the part of
the Lord to those who are married, but now, as from himself, he speaks
to “the rest:” hence perhaps to the unmarried, but this does not follow.
For thus he continues: “If any brother hath a wife that believeth not,
and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.” Hence,
even now he is speaking to those who are married. What, then, is his
object in saying “to the rest,” unless that he was speaking before to
those who were so united, that they were alike as to their faith in
Christ; but that now he is speaking to “the rest,” *i.e.* to those who
are so united, that they are not both believers? But what does he say to
them? “If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased
to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And the woman which hath an
husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let
her not put him away.” If, therefore, he does not give a command as from
the Lord, but advises as from himself, then this good result springs
from it, that if any one act otherwise, he is not a transgressor of a
command, just as he says a little after respecting virgins, that he has
no command of the Lord, but that he gives his advice; and he so praises
virginity, that whoever will may avail himself of it; yet if he shall
not do so, he may not be judged to have acted contrary to a command. For
there is one thing which is commanded, another respecting which advice
is given, another still which is allowed. <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) A wife is commanded not to depart from
her husband; and if she depart, to remain unmarried, or to be reconciled
to her husband: therefore it is not allowable for her to act otherwise.
But a believing husband is advised, if he has an unbelieving wife who is
pleased to dwell with him, not to put her away: therefore it is
allowable also to put her away, because it is no command of the Lord
that he should not put her away, but an advice of the apostle: just as a
virgin is advised not to marry; but if she shall marry, she will not
indeed adhere to the advice, but she will not act in opposition to a
command. Allowance is given <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) when
it is said, “But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.”
And there<span id="page_20">p. 20</span> <span
id="v.ii.xvi-Page_20"></span>fore, if it is allowable that an
unbelieving wife should be put away, although it is better not to put
her away, and yet not allowable, according to the commandment of the
Lord, that a wife should be put away, saving for the cause of
fornication, \[then\] unbelief itself also is fornication.

<span id="v.ii.xvi-p8"></span>45. For what sayest thou, O apostle?
Surely, that a believing husband who has an unbelieving wife pleased to
dwell with him is not to put her away? Just so, says he. When,
therefore, the Lord also gives this command, that a man should not put
away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, why dost thou say
here, “I speak, not the Lord”? For this reason, viz. that the idolatry
which unbelievers follow, and every other noxious superstition, is
fornication. Now, the Lord permitted a wife to be put away for the cause
of fornication; but in permitting, He did not command it: He gave
opportunity to the apostle for advising that whoever wished should not
put away an unbelieving wife, in order that, perchance, in this way she
might become a believer. “For,” says he, “the unbelieving husband is
sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the
brother.” <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) I suppose it had
already occurred that some wives were embracing the faith by means of
their believing husbands, and husbands by means of their believing
wives; and although not mentioning names, he yet urged his case by
examples, in order to strengthen his counsel. Then he goes on to say,
“Else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.” For now the
children were Christians, who were sanctified at the instance of one of
the parents, or with the consent of both; which would not take place
unless the marriage were broken up by one of the parties becoming a
believer, and unless the unbelief of the spouse were borne with so far
as to give an opportunity of believing. This, therefore, is the counsel
of Him whom I regard as having spoken the words, “Whatsoever thou
spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.” <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md)

<span id="v.ii.xvi-p11"></span>46. Moreover, if unbelief is fornication,
and idolatry unbelief, and covetousness idolatry, it is not to be
doubted that covetousness also is fornication. Who, then, in that case
can rightly separate any unlawful lust whatever from the category of
fornication, if covetousness is fornication? And from this we perceive,
that because of unlawful lusts, not only those of which one is guilty in
acts of uncleanness with another’s husband or wife, but any unlawful
lusts whatever, which cause the soul making a bad use of the body to
wander from the law of God, and to be ruinously and basely corrupted, a
man may, without crime, put away his wife, and a wife her husband,
because the Lord makes the cause of fornication an exception; which
fornication, in accordance with the above considerations, we are
compelled to understand as being general and universal.

<span id="v.ii.xvi-p12"></span>47. But when He says, “saving for the
cause of fornication,” He has not said of which of them, whether the man
or the woman. <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) For not only is it
allowed to put away a wife who commits fornication; but whoever puts
away that wife even by whom he is himself compelled to commit
fornication, puts her away undoubtedly for the cause of fornication. As,
for instance, if a wife should compel one to sacrifice to idols, the man
who puts away such an one puts her away for the cause of fornication,
not only on her part, but on his own also: on her part, because she
commits fornication; on his own, that he may not commit fornication.
Nothing, however, is more unjust than for a man to put away his wife
because of fornication, if he himself also is convicted of committing
fornication. For that passage occurs to one: “For wherein thou judgest
another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same
things.” <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) And for this reason,
whosoever wishes to put away his wife because of fornication, ought
first to be cleared of fornication; and a like remark I would make
respecting the woman also.

<span id="v.ii.xvi-p15"></span>48. But in reference to what He says,
“Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced <span
id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) committeth adultery,” it may be asked
whether she also who is married commits adultery in the same way as he
does who marries her. For she also is commanded to remain unmarried, or
be reconciled to her husband; but this in the case of her departing from
her husband. There is, however, a great difference whether she put away
or be put away. For if she put away her husband, and marry another, she
seems to have left her former husband from a desire of changing her
marriage connection, which is, without doubt, an adulterous thought. But
if she be put away by the husband, with whom she desired to be, he
indeed who marries her commits adultery, according to the Lord’s
declaration; but whether she also be involved in a like crime is
uncertain,—although it is much less easy to discover how, when a man and
woman have in<span id="page_21">p. 21</span> <span
id="v.ii.xvi-Page_21"></span>tercourse one with another with equal
consent, one of them should be an adulterer, and the other not. To this
is to be added the consideration, that if he commits adultery by
marrying her who is divorced from her husband (although she does not put
away, but is put away), she causes him to commit adultery, which
nevertheless the Lord forbids. And hence we infer that, whether she has
been put away, or has put away her husband, it is necessary for her to
remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md)

<span id="v.ii.xvi-p18"></span>49. Again, it is asked whether, if, with
a wife’s permission, either a barren one, or one who does not wish to
submit to intercourse, a man shall take to himself another woman, not
another man’s wife, nor one separated from her husband, he can do so
without being chargeable with fornication? And an example is found in
the Old Testament history; <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) but
now there are greater precepts which the human race has reached after
having passed that stage; and those matters are to be investigated for
the purpose of distinguishing the ages of the dispensation of that
divine providence which assists the human race in the most orderly way;
but not for the purpose of making use of the rules of living. But yet it
may be asked whether what the apostle says, “The wife hath not power of
her own body, but the husband; and likewise also the husband hath not
power of his own body, but the wife,” can be carried so far, that, with
the permission of a wife, who possesses the power over her husband’s
body, a man can have intercourse with another woman, who is neither
another man’s wife nor divorced from her husband; but such an opinion is
not to be entertained, lest it should seem that a woman also, with her
husband’s permission, could do such a thing, which the instinctive
feeling of every one prevents.

<span id="v.ii.xvi-p20"></span>50. And yet some occasions may arise,
where a wife also, with the consent of her husband, may seem under
obligation to do this for the sake of that husband himself; as, for
instance, is said to have happened at Antioch about fifty years
ago, <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) in the times of
Constantius. For Acyndinus, at that time prefect and at one time also
consul, when he demanded of a certain public debtor the payment of a
poundweight of gold, impelled by I know not what motive, did a thing
which is often dangerous in the case of those magistrates to whom
anything whatever is lawful, or rather is thought to be lawful, viz.
threatened with an oath and with a vehement affirmation, that if he did
not pay the foresaid gold on a certain day which he had fixed, he would
be put to death. Accordingly, while he was being kept in cruel
confinement, and was unable to rid himself of that debt, the dread day
began to impend and to draw near. He happened, however, to have a very
beautiful wife, but one who had no money wherewith to come to the relief
of her husband; and when a certain rich man had had his desires inflamed
by the beauty of this woman, and had learned that her husband was placed
in that critical situation, he sent to her, promising in return for a
single night, if she would consent to hold intercourse with him, that he
would give her the pound of gold. Then she, knowing that she herself had
not power over her body, but her husband, conveyed the intelligence to
him, telling him that she was prepared to do it for the sake of her
husband, but only if he himself, the lord by marriage of her body, to
whom all that chastity was due, should wish it to be done, as if
disposing of his own property for the sake of his life. He thanked her,
and commanded that it should be done, in no wise judging that it was an
adulterous embrace, because it was no lust, but great love for her
husband, that demanded it, at his own bidding and will. The woman came
to the villa of that rich man, did what the lewd man wished; but she
gave her body only to her husband, who desired not, as was usual, his
marriage rights, but life. She received the gold; but he who gave it
took away stealthily what he had given, and substituted a similar bag
with earth in it. When the woman, however, on reaching her home,
discovered it, she rushed forth in public in order to proclaim the deed
she had done, animated by the same tender affection for her husband by
which she had been forced to do it; she goes to the prefect, confesses
everything, shows the fraud that had been practised upon her. Then
indeed the prefect first pronounces himself guilty, because the matter
had come to this by means of his threats, and, as if pronouncing
sentence upon another, decided that a pound of gold should be brought
into the treasury from the property of Acyndinus; but that she (the
woman) be installed as mistress of that piece of land whence she had
received the earth instead of the gold. I offer no opinion either way
from this story: let each one form a judgment as he pleases, for the
history is not drawn from divinely authoritative sources; but yet, when
the story is related, man’s instinctive sense does not so revolt against
what was done in the case of this woman, at her husband’s bidding, as we
formerly shuddered when the thing itself was set forth without any
example. But in this section of the Gospel nothing is to be more
steadily kept in view, than that so great is the evil of fornication,
that, while married people are bound to one another by so strong a <span
id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span id="v.ii.xvi-Page_22"></span>bond, this
one cause of divorce is excepted; but as to what fornication is, that we
have already discussed.  <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md)

<span id="v.ii.xvi-p3"></span> Augustin expresses himself (*Retract*. I.
xix. 6) as having misgivings about his own explanation of this matter
here. He advises readers to go to his other writings on the subject of
marriage and divorce, or to the works of other writers. He says all sin
is not fornication (*omne peccatum fornicatio non est*); and to
determine which sins are fornication, and when a wife may be dismissed,
is a most broad (*latebrosissima*) question. He calls the question a
most difficult (*difficillimam*) one, and says, “But verily I feel that
I have not come to the perfect conclusion of this matter (*imo non me
pervenisse ad hujus rei perfectionem sentio*.” *Retract*. ii. 57). Some

Paulus, Döllinger (in *<span id="v.ii.xvi-p13.1"></span>Christ. u.
Kirche*, to which Professor Conington replied in *Cont. Rev.*, May,
1869) think the fornication of the woman was committed before her
marriage. Plumptre also prefers the reference to ante-nuptial sin.

positively, Stier *et. al.*, Alford hesitatingly). This explanation
might seem to limit re-marriage to such an one, inasmuch as the essence
of the marriage bond has not been touched (So Alford *et. al*.).

id="v.ii.xvi-p21.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.xvi-p22"></span> The law permitted divorce for “some
uncleanness” ([Deut. xxiv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.ii.xvi-p22.1"></span>). In the time of Christ divorce was allowed
on trivial grounds. While Schammai interpreted the Deuteronomic
prescription of *moral* uncleanness or adultery, Hillel interpreted it
to include *physical* uncleanness or unattractiveness. A wife’s cooking
her husband’s food unpalatably he declared to be a legitimate cause for
dissolution of the marriage bond. Opposing the loose views current,
Christ declared that it was on account of the “hardness of their hearts”
that Moses had *suffered* them to put away their wives, and asserted
adultery to be the only allowable reason for divorce. The question
whether the innocent party may marry, is beset with great difficulties
in view of this passage and [Matt. xix.
9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#009.md)<span id="v.ii.xvi-p22.2"></span>.
The answer turns somewhat upon the construction of the passage. Augustin
here, the Council of Trent (and so the Roman-Catholic Church), Weiss,
Mansel, and others hold that all marriage of a divorced person is
declared illegal. In another place (*De Conj. Adult*. i. 9) Augustin
says, “Why, I say, did the Lord interject ‘the cause of fornication,’
and not say rather, in a general way, ‘Whosoever shall put away his wife
and marry another commits adultery’?…I think, because the Lord wishes to
mention that which is greater. For who will deny that it is a greater
adultery to marry another when the divorced wife has not committed
fornication than when any one divorces his wife and then marries
another? Not because this is not adultery, but because it is a lesser
sort.” The *Apost. Constitutions* (vii. 2) say, “Thou shalt not commit
adultery, for thou dividest one flesh into two,” etc. Weiss: “Jesus
everywhere takes it for granted that in the sight of God there is no
such thing as a dissolution of the marriage bond” (*Leben Jesu*, i.
529). President Woolsey, on the other hand, unhesitatingly declares,
that, by Christ’s precepts, marriage is dissolved by adultery, so that
the innocent party may marry again. According to this passage, the woman
divorced on other grounds than adultery seems to be declared adulterous
if she marry. According to [Matt. xix.
9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#009.md)<span id="v.ii.xvi-p22.3"></span> the
man who puts away his wife for adultery, seems to be permitted to marry
without becoming adulterous himself. According to [Mark x.
12](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#012.md)<span id="v.ii.xvi-p22.4"></span>
the woman had the privilege in that day of putting away her husband, but
“there is no evidence in the Hebrew Scriptures that the woman could get
herself divorced from her husband.” To the able treatment of Augustin,
which might seem either exceedingly fearless or mawkish at the present
day, according to the stand-point of the critic, the reader would do
well to read Alford and Lange on this passage; Stanley on [1 Cor. vii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#011.md)<span id="v.ii.xvi-p22.5"></span>;
and Woolsey, art. “Divorce” in *Schaff-Herzog Encycl*. Whatever may be
the exact meaning of our Lord concerning the marriage of the innocent
party, it is evident that He regards the marriage bond as profoundly
sacred, and warrants the celebrant in binding the parties to marriage to
be faithful one to the other “till death do you part.” He Himself said,
“What, therefore, God hath joined together, let not man put asunder”
([Mark x. 9](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#009.md)<span
id="v.ii.xvi-p22.6"></span>).
