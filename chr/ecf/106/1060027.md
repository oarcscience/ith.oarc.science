<span id="v.ii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.</span>

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p2"></span>69. In the next place, He goes on to say,
“Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour,
and hate thine enemy: But I say unto you, Love your enemies, do good to
them that hate you, and pray for them which persecute you; <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) that ye may be the children of your
Father which is in heaven: for He commandeth <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) His sun to rise on the evil and on the
good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. For if ye
love <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) them which love you, what
reward have ye? Do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute
your brethren only, what do ye more than others? Do not even the
Gentiles the very same? <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) Be ye
therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) is perfect.” For without this love,
wherewith we are commanded to love even our enemies and persecutors, who
can fully carry out those things which are mentioned above? Moreover,
the perfection of that mercy, wherewith most of all the soul that is in
distress is cared for, cannot be stretched beyond the love of an enemy;
and therefore the closing words are: “Be ye therefore perfect, even as
your Father who is in heaven is perfect.” Yet in such a way that God is
understood to be perfect as God, and the soul to be perfect as a soul.

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p8"></span>70. That there is, however, a certain step
\[in advance\] in the righteousness of the Pharisees, which belongs to
the old law, is perceived from this consideration, that many men hate
even those by whom they are loved; as, for instance, luxurious children
hate their parents for restraining them in their luxury. That man
therefore rises a certain step, who loves his neighbour, although as yet
he hates his enemy. But in the kingdom of Him who came to fulfil the
law, not to destroy it, he will bring benevolence and kindness to
perfection, when he has carried it out so far as to love an enemy. For
the former stage, although it is something, is yet so little that it may
be reached even by the publicans as well. And as to what is said in the
law, “Thou shalt hate thine enemy,” <span
id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) it is not to be understood <span
id="page_30">p. 30</span> <span id="v.ii.xxi-Page_30"></span>as the
voice of command addressed to a righteous man, but rather as the voice
of permission to a weak man.

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p10"></span>71. Here indeed arises a question in no
way to be blinked, that to this precept of the Lord, wherein He exhorts
us to love our enemies, and to do good to those who hate us, and to pray
for those who persecute us, many other parts of Scripture seem to those
who consider them less diligently and soberly to stand opposed; for in
the prophets there are found many imprecations against enemies, which
are thought to be curses: as, for instance, that one, “Let their table
become a snare,” <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) and the other
things which are said there; and that one, “Let his children be
fatherless, and his wife a widow,” <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) and the other statements which are
made either before or afterwards in the same Psalm by the prophet, as
bearing on the case of Judas. Many other statements are found in all
parts of Scripture, which may seem contrary both to this precept of the
Lord, and to that apostolic one, where it is said, “Bless; and curse
not;” <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) while it is both written
of the Lord, that He cursed the cities which received not His
word; <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) and the above-mentioned
apostle thus spoke respecting a certain man, “The Lord will reward him
according to his works.” <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md)

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p16"></span>72. But these difficulties are easily
solved, for the prophet predicted by means of imprecation what was about
to happen, not as praying for what he wished, but in the spirit of one
who saw it beforehand. So also the Lord, so also the apostle; although
even in the words of these we do not find what they have wished, but
what they have foretold. For when the Lord says, “Woe unto thee,
Capernaum,” He does not utter anything else than that some evil will
happen to her as a punishment of her unbelief; and that this would
happen the Lord did not malevolently wish, but saw by means of His
divinity. And the apostle does not say, May \[the Lord\] reward; but,
“The Lord will reward him according to his work;” which is the word of
one who foretells, not of one uttering an imprecation. Just as also, in
regard to that hypocrisy of the Jews of which we have already spoken,
whose destruction he saw to be impending, he said,” God shall smite
thee, thou whited wall.”  <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) But
the prophets especially are accustomed to predict future events under
the figure of one uttering an imprecation, just as they have often
foretold those things which were to come under the figure of past time:
as is the case, for example, in that passage, “Why have the nations
raged, and the peoples imagined vain things?” <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) For he has not said, Why will the
heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? although he was not
mentioning those things as if they were already past, but was looking
forward to them as yet to come. Such also is that passage, “They have
parted my garments among them, and have cast lots upon my
vesture:” <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) for here also he has
not said, They will part my garments among them, and will cast lots upon
my vesture. And yet no one finds fault with these words, except the man
who does not perceive that variety of figures in speaking in no degree
lessens the truth of facts, and adds very much to the impressions on our
minds.

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p9"></span> The first part of the Lord’s quotation is
found in [Lev. xix. 18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md)<span
id="v.ii.xxi-p9.1"></span>; these words, whatever may be said about the
sanction, real or apparent, of revenge and triumph over an enemy’s fall
in the Old Testament, are not found there. Bengel well says “*pessima
glossa*” (“wretched gloss”),—a gloss of the Pharisees, “bearing plainly
enough the character of post-exilic Judaism in its exclusiveness toward
all surrounding nations” (Weiss). Centuries after Christ spoke these
words, Maimonides gives utterance to this narrow feeling of hate: “If a
Jew see a Gentile fall into the sea, let him by no means take him out;
for it is written, ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour’s blood,’ but this is
not thy neighbour.” The separation of the Jews, demanded by their
theocratic position, was the explanation in part—not an excuse—for such
feeling towards people of other nationalities. Heathen peoples had the
same feeling towards enemies. “It was the celebrated felicity of Sulla;
and this was the crown of Xenophon’s panegyric of Cyrus the Younger,
that no one had done more good to his friends or more mischief to his
enemies.” Plautus said, “Man is a wolf to the stranger” (“*homo homini
ignoto lupus est*”). The term “stranger” in Greek means “enemy.” But
common as this philosophy was to the pre-Christian world, the Jew was
specially known for his hatred of all not of his own nationality
(Juvenal, *Sat*. xiv. 104, etc.). The “enemy” referred to in the passage
is not a national enemy ( Keim) but a personal one (Weiss, Meyer, etc.).
Our Lord subsequently defined who was to be understood by the term
“neighbour” in the parable of the Good Samaritan ([Luke x.
36](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#036)<span id="v.ii.xxi-p9.2"></span>.md).
