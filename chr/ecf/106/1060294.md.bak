etc., on the five porches, where lay a great multitude of impotent folk,
and of the pool of Siloa.*

<span id="vii.lxxvii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.lxxvii-p4.1"></span>Subjects</span> strange neither to your ears
nor hearts are now repeated: yet do they revive the affections of the
hearer, and by repetition in some sort renew us: nor is it wearisome to
hear what is well known already, for the words of the Lord are always
sweet. The exposition of the sacred Scriptures is as the sacred
Scriptures themselves: though they be well known, yet are they read to
impress the remembrance of them. And so the exposition of them, though
it be well known, is nevertheless to be repeated, that they who have
forgotten it may be reminded, or they who chanced not to hear it may
hear; and that with those who do retain what they are used to hear, it
may by the repetition be brought to pass that they shall not be able to
forget it. For I remember that I have already spoken to you, Beloved, on
this lesson of the Gospel. Yet to repeat the same explanation to you is
not wearisome, even as it was not wearisome to repeat the same Lesson to
you. The Apostle Paul saith in a certain Epistle, “To write the same
things to you, to me indeed is not wearisome, but for you it is
necessary.” <span id="fr_3684"></span>[3685](#fn_3684.md) So too with
myself to say the same things to you, to me is not wearisome, but for
you it is safe.

<span id="vii.lxxvii-p6"></span>2. The five porches in which the infirm
folk lay signify the Law, which was first given to the Jews and to the
people of Israel by Moses the servant of God. For this Moses the
minister of the Law wrote five books. In relation therefore <span
id="page_476">p. 476</span> <span id="vii.lxxvii-Page_476"></span>to the
number of the books which he wrote, the five porches figured the Law.
But because the Law was not given to heal the infirm, but to discover
and to manifest them; for so saith the Apostle, “For if there had been a
law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have
been by the Law; But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that
the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that
believe;” <span id="fr_3685"></span>[3686](#fn_3685.md) therefore in those
porches the sick folk lay, but were not cured. For what saith he? “If
there had been a law given which could have given life.” Therefore those
porches which figured the Law could not cure the sick. Some one will say
to me, “Why then was it given?” The Apostle Paul hath himself explained:
“Scripture,” saith he, “hath concluded all under sin, that the promise
by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.” For these
folk who were sick, thought themselves to be whole. They received the
Law, which they were not able to fulfil; they learnt in what disease
they were, and they implored the Physician’s aid; they wished to be
cured because they came to know they were in distress, which they would
not have known if they had not been unable to fulfil the Law which had
been given. For man thought himself innocent, and from this very pride
of false innocence became more mad. To tame this pride then and to lay
it bare, the Law was given; not to deliver the sick, but to convince the
proud. Attend then, Beloved; to this end was the Law given, to discover
diseases, not to take them away. And so then those sick folk who might
have been sick in their own houses with greater privacy, if those five
porches had not existed, were in those porches set forth to the eyes of
all men, but were not by the porches cured. The Law therefore was useful
to discover sins, because that man being made more abundantly guilty by
the transgression of the Law, might, having tamed his pride, implore the
help of Him That pitieth. Attend to the Apostle; “The Law entered that
sin might abound; but where sin abounded, grace hath much more
abounded.” <span id="fr_3686"></span>[3687](#fn_3686.md) What is, “The Law
entered that sin might abound”? As in another place he saith, “For where
there is no law, there is no transgression.” <span
id="fr_3687"></span>[3688](#fn_3687.md) Man may be called a sinner before
the Law, a transgressor he cannot. But when he hath sinned, after that
he hath received the Law, he is found not only a sinner, but a
transgressor. Forasmuch then as to sin is added transgression, therefore
“hath sin abounded.” And when sin abounds, human pride learns at length
to submit itself, and to confess to God, and to say “I am weak.” To say
to those words of the Psalm which none but the humbled soul saith, “I
said, Lord, be merciful unto me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against
thee.” <span id="fr_3688"></span>[3689](#fn_3688.md) Let the weak soul then
say this that is at least convinced by transgression, and not cured, but
manifested by the Law. Hear too Paul himself showing thee, both that the
Law is good, and yet that nothing but the grace of Christ delivereth
from sin. For the Law can prohibit and command; apply the medicine, that
that which doth not allow a man to fulfil the Law, may be cured, it
cannot, but grace only doeth that. For the Apostle saith, “For I delight
in the Law of God after the inner man.” <span
id="fr_3689"></span>[3690](#fn_3689.md) That is, I see now that what the
Law blames is evil, and what the Law commands is good. “For I delight in
the Law of God after the inner man. I see another law in my members
resisting the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity in the law
of sin.” This derived from the punishment of sin, from the propagation
of death, from the condemnation of Adam, “resists the law of the mind,
and brings it into captivity in the law of sin which is in the members.”
He was convinced; he received the Law, that he might be convinced: see
now what profit it was to him that he was convinced. Hear the following
words, “Wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of
this death? The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” <span
id="fr_3690"></span>[3691](#fn_3690.md)

<span id="vii.lxxvii-p13"></span>3. Give heed then. Those five porches
were significative of the Law, bearing the sick, not healing them;
discovering, not curing them. But who did cure the sick? He that
descended into the pool. And when did the sick man descend into the
pool? When the Angel gave the sign by the moving of the water. For thus
was that pool sanctified, for that the Angel came down and moved the
water. Men saw the water; and from the motion of the troubled water they
understood the presence of the Angel. If any one then went down, he was
cured. Why then was not that sick man cured? Let us consider his own
words; “I have no man,” he says, “when the water is moved, to put me
into the pool, but while I am coming, another steppeth down.” <span
id="fr_3691"></span>[3692](#fn_3691.md) Couldest not thou then step down
afterwards, if another step down before thee? Here it is shown us, that
only one was cured at the moving of the water. Whosoever stepped down
first, he alone was cured: but whoever stepped down afterwards, at that
moving of the water was not cured, but waited till it was moved again.
What then does this mystery <span id="fr_3692"></span>[3693](#fn_3692.md)
mean? For it is not without a meaning. Attend, Beloved. Waters are put
in the Apocalypse for a figure of peoples. For when in the Apocalypse
John saw many waters, he asked what it meant, and it was told him that
they were peoples. <span id="fr_3693"></span>[3694](#fn_3693.md) <span
id="page_477">p. 477</span> <span id="vii.lxxvii-Page_477"></span>The
water then of the pool signified the people of the Jews. For as that
people was held in by the five books of Moses in the Law, so that water
too was enclosed by five porches. When was the water troubled? When the
people of the Jews was troubled. And when was the people of the Jews
troubled, but when the Lord Jesus Christ came? The Lord’s Passion was
the troubling of the water. For the Jews were troubled when the Lord
suffered. See, what was just now read had relation to this troubling.
“The Jews wished to kill Him, not only because He did these things on
the sabbaths, but because He called Himself the Son of God, making
Himself equal with God.” <span id="fr_3694"></span>[3695](#fn_3694.md) For
Christ called Himself the Son after one manner, in another was it said
to men, “I said, Ye are Gods, and ye are all children of the Most
High.” <span id="fr_3695"></span>[3696](#fn_3695.md) For if He had made
Himself the Son of God in such sort as any man whatever may be called
the son of God (for by the grace of God men are called sons of God); the
Jews would not have been enraged. But because they understand Him to
call Himself the Son of God in another way, according to that, “In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God;” <span id="fr_3696"></span>[3697](#fn_3696.md) and according to what
the Apostle saith, “Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery
to be equal with God;” <span id="fr_3697"></span>[3698](#fn_3697.md) they
saw a man, and they were enraged, because He made Himself equal with
God. But He well knew that He was equal, but wherein they saw not. For
that which they saw they wished to crucify; by That which they saw not,
they were judged. What did the Jews see? What the Apostles also saw,
when Philip said, “Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.” <span
id="fr_3698"></span>[3699](#fn_3698.md) But what did the Jews not see? What
not even the Apostles saw, when the Lord answered, “Have I been so long
time with you, and yet have ye not known Me? He that seeth Me, seeth the
Father also.” <span id="fr_3699"></span>[3700](#fn_3699.md) Because then
the Jews were not able to see This in Him, they held Him for a proud and
ungodly man, making Himself equal with God. Here was a troubling, the
water was troubled, the Angel had come. For the Lord is called also the
“Angel of the Great Counsel,” <span id="fr_3700"></span>[3701](#fn_3700.md)
in that He is the messenger of the Father’s will. For Angel in Greek is
in Latin “messenger”. So you have the Lord saying that He announces to
us the kingdom of Heaven. He then had come, the “Angel of the Great
Counsel,” but the Lord of all the Angels. “Angel” on this account,
because He took Flesh; the “Lord of Angels,” in that by “Him all things
were made, and without Him was nothing made.” <span
id="fr_3701"></span>[3702](#fn_3701.md) For if all things, Angels too. And
therefore Himself was not made, because by Him all things were made. Now
what was made, was not made without the operation of the Word. But the
flesh which became the mother of Christ, could not have been born, if it
had not been created by the Word, which was afterwards born of it.

<span id="vii.lxxvii-p25"></span>4. The Jews then were troubled. What is
this? “Why doeth He these things on the sabbath days?” And especially at
those words of the Lord, “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.” <span
id="fr_3702"></span>[3703](#fn_3702.md) Their carnal understanding of this,
that God rested on the seventh day from all His works, <span
id="fr_3703"></span>[3704](#fn_3703.md) “troubled them.” For this is
written in Genesis, and most excellently written it is, and on the best
reasons. But they thinking that God as it were rested from fatigue on
the seventh day after all, and that He therefore blessed it, because on
it He was refreshed from His weariness, did not in their foolishness
understand, that He who made all things by the Word, could not be
wearied. Let them read, and tell me how could God be wearied, who said,
“Let it be made, and it was made.” To-day if a man could so do, as God
did, how would he be wearied? He said, “Let there be light, and the
light was made.” Again, “Let there be a firmament, and it was
made:” <span id="fr_3704"></span>[3705](#fn_3704.md) if indeed He said, and
it was not done, He was wearied. In another place briefly, “He spake,
and they were made; He commanded, and they were created.” <span
id="fr_3705"></span>[3706](#fn_3705.md) He then who worketh thus, how doth
He labour? But if He labour not, how doth He rest? But in that sabbath,
in which it is said that God rested from all His works, in the Rest of
God our rest was signified; because the sabbath of this world shall be,
when the six ages shall have passed away. The six days as it were of the
world are passing away. One day hath passed away, from Adam unto Noe;
another from the deluge unto Abraham; the third from Abraham unto David;
the fourth from David unto the carrying away into Babylon; the fifth
from the carrying away into Babylon unto the advent of our Lord Jesus
Christ. Now the sixth day is in passing. We are in the sixth age, in the
sixth day. Let us then be reformed after the image of God, because that
on the sixth day man was made after the image of God. <span
id="fr_3706"></span>[3707](#fn_3706.md) What formation did then, let
reformation do in us, and what creation did there, let creating-anew do
in us. After this day in which we now are, after this age, the rest
which is promised to the saints and prefigured in those days, shall
come. Because in very truth too, after all things which He made in the
world, He hath made nothing new in creation afterwards. The creatures
themselves <span id="page_478">p. 478</span> <span
id="vii.lxxvii-Page_478"></span>shall be transformed and changed. For
since the creatures were fashioned, nothing more has been added. But
nevertheless, if He who made did not rule the world, what is made would
fall to ruin: He cannot but administer that which He hath made. Because
then nothing hath been added to the creation, He is said to have rested
from all His works; but because He doth not cease to govern what He
made, rightly did the Lord say, “My Father worketh even hitherto.”
Attend, Beloved. He finished, He is said to have rested; for He finished
His works, and hath added no more. He governeth what He hath made;
therefore He doth not cease to work. But with the same facility that He
made, with the same doth He govern. For do not suppose, brethren, that
when He created He did not labour, and that He laboureth in that He
governeth: as in a ship, they labour who build the ship, and they who
manage it labour too; for they are men. For with the same facility
wherewith “He spake and they were made,” with the same facility and
judgment doth He govern all things by the Word.

<span id="vii.lxxvii-p31"></span>5. Let us not, because human affairs
seem to be in disorder, fancy that there is no governance of human
affairs. For all men are ordered in their proper places; but to every
man it seems as though they have no order. Do thou only look to what
thou wouldest wish to be; for as thou shalt wish to be, the Master <span
id="fr_3707"></span>[3708](#fn_3707.md) knoweth where to place thee. Look
at a painter. Before him are placed various colours, and he knows where
to set each colour on. Questionless the sinner hath chosen to be the
black colour; does not then the Artist <span
id="fr_3708"></span>[3709](#fn_3708.md) know where to place him? How many
parts does the painter finish off with the colour of black? how many
ornaments does he make of it? With it he makes the hair, the beard, the
eye-brows; he makes the face of white only. Look then to that which thou
wouldest wish to be; take no care where He may order thee who cannot
err, He knoweth where to place thee. For so we see it happen by the
common laws of the world. Some man, for instance, has chosen to be a
house-breaker: the law of the judge knows that he has acted contrary to
the law: the law of the judge knows where to place him; and orders him
most properly. He indeed has lived evilly; but not evilly has the law
ordered him. From a house-breaker he will be sentenced to the mines;
from the labour of such how great works are constructed? That condemned
man’s punishment is the city’s ornament. So then God knoweth where to
place thee. Do not think that thou art disturbing the counsel of God, if
thou art minded to be disorderly. Doth not He who knew how to create,
know how to order thee? Good were it for thee to strive for this, to be
set in a good place. What was said of Judas by the Apostle? “He went
unto his own place.” <span id="fr_3709"></span>[3710](#fn_3709.md) By the
operation of course of Divine Providence, because by an evil will he
chose to be evil, but God did not by ordering evil make it. But because
that evil man himself chose to be a sinner, he did what he would, and
suffered what he would not. In that he did what he would, his sin is
discovered; in that he suffered what he would not, the order of God is
praised.

<span id="vii.lxxvii-p35"></span>6. Wherefore have I said all this? That
ye, brethren, may understand what was most excellently said by the Lord
Jesus Christ, “My Father worketh even hitherto.” In that He doth not
abandon the creature which He made. And He said, “As He worketh, so do I
also work.” In this He at once signified that He was equal with God. “My
Father,” saith He, “worketh hitherto, and I work.” Their carnal sense
touching the rest <span id="fr_3710"></span>[3711](#fn_3710.md) was
troubled. For they thought that the Lord being wearied rested, that He
should work no more. They hear, “My Father worketh even hitherto:” they
are troubled. “And I work:” <span id="fr_3711"></span>[3712](#fn_3711.md)
He hath made Himself equal with God: they are troubled. But be not
alarmed. The water is troubled, now the sick man is to be cured. What
meaneth this? Therefore are they troubled, that the Lord may suffer. The
Lord doth suffer, the precious Blood is shed, the sinner is redeemed,
grace is given to the sinner, to him that saith, “Wretched man that I
am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.”  <span
id="fr_3712"></span>[3713](#fn_3712.md) But how is he cured? If he step
down. For that pool was so made, that men should go down, and not come
up to it. For there might be pools of such a kind, so constructed, that
men must go up to them. But why was this made in such a way that men
must go down to it? Because the Lord’s Passion searches for the humble.
Let the humble go down, let him not be proud, if he wishes to be cured.
But why was it but “one”? Because the Church is only One throughout the
world, unity is saved. When then one is made whole, unity is signified.
By one understand unity. Depart not then from unity, if thou wouldest
not be without a part in this saving <span
id="fr_3713"></span>[3714](#fn_3713.md) cure.

<span id="vii.lxxvii-p40"></span>7. What then does it mean that the man
was in infirmity thirty-eight years? I know, brethren, that I have
spoken of this already; but even those who read forget, how much more
they who hear but seldom? Attend therefore for a little while, Beloved.
In <span id="fr_3714"></span>[3715](#fn_3714.md) the number forty, the
accomplishment of righteousness is <span id="page_479">p. 479</span>
<span id="vii.lxxvii-Page_479"></span>figured. The accomplishment of
righteousness, in that we live here in labour, in toil, in
self-restraint, in fastings, in watchings, in tribulations; this is the
exercise of righteousness, to bear this present time, and to fast as it
were from this world; not from the food of the body, which we do but
seldom; but from the love of the world, which we ought to do always. He
then fulfils the law who abstains from this world. For he cannot love
that which is eternal, unless he shall cease to love that which is
temporal. Consider a man’s love: think of it as, so to say, the hand of
the soul. If it is holding anything, it cannot hold anything else. But
that it may be able to hold what is given to it, it must leave go what
it holds already. This I say, see how expressly I say it; “Whoso loveth
the world cannot love God; he hath his hand engaged.” God saith to him,
“Hold what I give.” He will not leave go what he was holding; he cannot
receive what is offered. Have I said a man should not possess ought? If
he is able, if perfection require this of him, let him not possess. If
hindered by any necessity he is not able, let him possess, not be
possessed; let him hold, not be held; let him be the lord of his
possessions, not the slave; as saith the Apostle “However, brethren, the
time is short; it remaineth that both they that have wives, be as though
they had not; and they who buy, as though they possessed not; and they
who rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they who weep, as though
they wept not; and they who use this world, as though they used <span
id="fr_3715"></span>[3716](#fn_3715.md) it not; for the fashion of this
world passeth away. I would have you be without carefulness.” <span
id="fr_3716"></span>[3717](#fn_3716.md) What is, “Do not love what thou
dost possess in this world”? Let it not hold thine hand fast, by which
God must be held. Let not thy love be engaged, whereby thou canst make
thy way to God, and cleave to Him who created thee.

<span id="vii.lxxvii-p44"></span>8. Thou wilt say and make answer to me,
“Yea, God knows that I possess innocently what I have.” Temptation
proves thee. There is a troubling of thy possessions, and thou dost
blaspheme. It is but lately we were in such a case. There is a troubling
of thy possessions, and thou art not found what thou wast, and dost show
that there is one thing in thy mouth to-day, and another in thy mouth
yesterday. And I would that thou wouldest only defend thine own even
with vehemence; <span id="fr_3717"></span>[3718](#fn_3717.md) and not try
to usurp with audacity another’s; and what is worse, to escape
reprehension, maintain that what is another’s is thine own. But why need
I say more? This I advise, this I say, Brethren, and as a brother
advise; God bids, and I admonish because I am admonished. He alarmeth
me, who doth not allow me to keep silence. He exacteth of me what He
hath given. For He hath given it to be laid out, not to be kept up. And
if I should keep it and hide it, He saith to me, “Thou wicked and
slothful servant, wherefore gavest thou not My money to the exchangers,
that at My coming I might require it with usury?” <span
id="fr_3718"></span>[3719](#fn_3718.md) And what will it profit me that I
have lost nothing of that which I received? That is not enough for my
Lord, He is covetous; but God’s covetousness is our salvation. He is
covetous, He looketh for His own money, He gathereth in His Own image.
“Thou shouldest have given,” saith He, “the money to the exchangers,
that at My coming I might require it with usury.” And if by any chance
forgetfulness should make me fail of admonishing you, the temptations
and tribulations at least which we are suffering, would be an admonition
to you. Ye have heard at least the word of God. Blessed be the Lord and
His glory. For ye are here gathered together, and are hanging on the
word of God’s minister. Turn not your attention to our flesh, by which
the word is given out to you; for hungry men regard not the meanness of
the dish, but the preciousness of the food. God is proving you. Ye are
gathered together, ye praise the word of God; temptation will prove in
what manner ye hear it: ye will have the active business of life whereby
your true character will be shown. For so he who to-day is shouting with
railings, was yesterday a ready listener. Therefore I forewarn;
therefore I tell you, therefore I do not withhold it, my Brethren, that
the time of questioning will come. For the Lord maketh question of the
righteous and of the ungodly. This you know ye have sung, this have we
sung together; “The Lord maketh question of the righteous and the
ungodly.” And what follows? “But he that loveth iniquity, hateth his own
soul.” <span id="fr_3719"></span>[3720](#fn_3719.md) And in another place,
“Into the thoughts of the ungodly there shall be questioning
made.” <span id="fr_3720"></span>[3721](#fn_3720.md) God doth not make
question of thee there, where I question thee. I question thy tongue,
God questioneth thy thoughts. For He knoweth how thou dost hear, and He
knoweth how to require, Who ordereth me to give. He hath wished me to be
a dispenser, the requiring He hath reserved to Himself. To admonish, to
teach, to rebuke, is ours; but to save, and to crown, or to condemn, and
to cast into hell, is not ours; “But the Judge shall deliver to the
officer, and the officer to the prison. Verily I say unto thee, thou
shalt not go out thence, till thou payest the last farthing.” <span
id="fr_3721"></span>[3722](#fn_3721.md)

<span id="vii.lxxvii-p50"></span>9. Let us then return to our subject.
The perfection of righteousness is shown by the number forty. What is it
to fulfil the number <span id="page_480">p. 480</span> <span
id="vii.lxxvii-Page_480"></span>forty? To restrain one’s self from the
love of this world. Restraint from temporal things, that they be not
loved to our destruction, is, as it were, fasting from this world.
Therefore the Lord fasted forty days, and Moses, and Elias. He then who
gave His servants the power to fast forty days, could He not fast eighty
or a hundred? Why then did He not will to fast more than He had given
His servants to do, but because in this number forty is the mystery of
fasting, the restraint from this world? What is this to say? What the
Apostle says; “The world is crucified to me, and I to the world.” <span
id="fr_3722"></span>[3723](#fn_3722.md) He then fulfils the number forty.
And what doth the Lord show? That because Moses did this, this Elias,
this Christ, that this both the Law, and the Prophets, and the Gospel,
teach; that thou mayest not think that there is one thing in the Law,
another in the Prophets, another in the Gospel. All Scripture teacheth
thee nothing else, but restraint from the love of the world, that thy
love may speed on to God. As a figure that the Law teaches this, Moses
fasted forty days. As a figure that the Prophets teach it, Elias fasted
forty days. As a figure that the Gospel teaches it, the Lord fasted
forty days. And therefore in the mount too these three appeared, the
Lord in the middle, Moses and Elias at the sides. Wherefore? Because the
Gospel itself receives testimony from the Law and the Prophets. <span
id="fr_3723"></span>[3724](#fn_3723.md) But why in the number forty is the
perfection of righteousness? In the Psalter it is said, “O God, I will
sing a new song unto Thee, upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing
praises unto Thee.” <span id="fr_3724"></span>[3725](#fn_3724.md) Which
signifies the ten precepts of the Law, which the Lord came not to
destroy, but to fulfil. And the Law itself throughout the whole world,
it is evident, hath four quarters, the East, and West, South, and North,
as the Scripture saith. And hence the vessel which bare all the
emblematic animals, which was exhibited to Peter, when he was told,
“Kill and eat,” <span id="fr_3725"></span>[3726](#fn_3725.md) that it might
be shown that the Gentiles should believe and enter into the body of the
Church, just as what we eat entereth into our body, and which was let
down from heaven by four corners (these are the four quarters of the
world), showed that the whole world should believe. Therefore in the
number forty is restraint from the world. This is the fulfilling of the
Law: now the fulfilling of the Law is charity. And therefore before the
Pasch we fast forty days. For this time before the Pasch is the sign of
this our toilsome life, wherein, in toils, and cares, and continence, we
fulfil the Law. But afterwards we celebrate the Pasch, that is, the days
of the Lord’s resurrection signifying our own resurrection. Therefore
fifty days are celebrated; because the reward of the denarius is added
to the forty, and it becomes fifty. Why is the reward a denarius? Have
ye not read, how that they who were hired into the vineyard, whether at
the first, or sixth, or the last hour, could only receive the
denarius? <span id="fr_3726"></span>[3727](#fn_3726.md) When to our
righteousness shall be added its reward, we shall be in the number
fifty. Yea, and then shall we have none other occupation, save to praise
God. And therefore throughout those days we say, “Hallelujah.” For
Halleluiah is the praise of God. In this frail estate of mortality, in
this fortieth number here, as though before the resurrection, let us
groan in prayers, that we may sing praises then. Now is the time of
longing, then will be the time of embracing and enjoying. Let us not
faint in the time of forty, that we may joy in the time of fifty.

<span id="vii.lxxvii-p56"></span>10. Now who is he that fulfilleth the
Law, but he that hath charity? Ask the Apostle, “Charity is the
fulfilling of the Law. <span id="fr_3727"></span>[3728](#fn_3727.md) For
all the Law is fulfilled in one word, in that which is written, Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” <span
id="fr_3728"></span>[3729](#fn_3728.md) But the commandment of charity is
twofold; “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the great commandment. The
other is like it; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” They are
the words of the Lord in the Gospel: “On these two commandments hang all
the Law and the Prophets.” <span id="fr_3729"></span>[3730](#fn_3729.md)
Without this twofold love the Law cannot be fulfilled. As long as the
Law is not fulfilled, there is infirmity. Therefore he had two short,
who was infirm thirty and eight years. What means, “had two short”? He
did not fulfil these two commandments. What doth it profit that the rest
is fulfilled, if those are not fulfilled? Hast thou thirty-eight? If
thou have not those two, the rest will profit thee nothing. Thou hast
two short, without which the rest avail not, if thou have not the two
commandments which conduct unto salvation. “If I speak with the tongues
of men and angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass,
or a tinkling cymbal. And if I know all mysteries, and all knowledge,
and if I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not
charity, I am nothing. And if I distribute all my substance, and if I
give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing.” <span id="fr_3730"></span>[3731](#fn_3730.md) They are the
Apostle’s words. All those things therefore which he mentioned are as it
were the thirty-eight years; but because charity was not there, there
was infirmity. From that infirmity who then shall make whole, but He who
came to give charity? “A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love
one another.” <span id="fr_3731"></span>[3732](#fn_3731.md) And because He
came to <span id="page_481">p. 481</span> <span
id="vii.lxxvii-Page_481"></span>give charity, and charity fulfilleth the
Law, with good reason said He, “I came not to destroy the Law, but to
fulfil.” <span id="fr_3732"></span>[3733](#fn_3732.md) He cured the sick
man, and told him to carry his couch, and go unto his house. <span
id="fr_3733"></span>[3734](#fn_3733.md) And so too He said to the sick of
the palsy whom He cured. <span id="fr_3734"></span>[3735](#fn_3734.md) What
is it to carry our couch? The pleasure of our flesh. Where we lie in
infirmity, is as it were our bed. But they who are cured master <span
id="fr_3735"></span>[3736](#fn_3735.md) and carry it, are not by this flesh
mastered. So then, thou whole one, master the frailness of thy flesh,
that in the sign of the forty days’ fast from this world, thou mayest
fulfill the number forty, for that He hath made that sick man whole,
“Who came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil.”

<span id="vii.lxxvii-p66"></span>11. Having heard this, direct your
heart to Godward. Do not deceive yourselves. Ask yourselves then when it
is well with you in the world ; then ask yourselves, whether ye love the
world, or whether ye love it not; learn to let it go before ye are let
go yourselves. What is to let it go? Not heartily to love it. Whilst
there is yet something with thee which thou must one day lose, and
either in life or death let it go, it cannot be with thee always; whilst
I say it is yet with thee, loosen thy love; be prepared for the will of
God, hang upon God. Hold thee fast to Him, whom thou canst not lose
against thy will, that if it chance thee to lose these temporal things,
thou mayest say, “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away, as it hath
pleased the Lord, so is it done, blessed be the Name of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3736"></span>[3737](#fn_3736.md) But if it chance, and God so wills
it, that the things thou hast be with thee even to the last: for thy
detachment from this life thou receivest the denarius, the fifty, and
the perfection of blessedness cometh to pass in thee, when thou shalt
sing Hallelujah. Having these things which I have now brought forward in
your memory, may they avail to overthrowing your love of the world. Evil
is its friendship, deceitful, it makes a man the enemy of God. Soon, in
one single temptation, a man offendeth God, and becometh His enemy. Nay
not then becometh His enemy; but is then discovered to have been His
enemy. For when he was loving and praising Him, he was an enemy; but he
neither knew it himself, nor did others. Temptation came, the pulse is
touched, and the fever discovered. So then brethren, the love of the
world, and the friendship of the world, make men the enemies of God. And
it does not make good what it promises, it is a liar, and deceiveth.
Therefore men never cease hoping in this world, and who attains to all
he hopes for? But whereunto soever he attains, what he has attained to
is forthwith disesteemed by him. Other things begin to be desired, other
fond things are hoped for; and when they come, whatsoever it is that
comes to thee, is disesteemed. Hold thee fast then to God, for He can
never be of light esteem, for nothing is more beautiful than He. For for
this cause are these things disesteemed, because they cannot stand,
because they are not what He is. For nought, O soul, sufficeth thee,
save He who created thee. Whatsoever else thou apprehendest is wretched;
for He Alone can suffice thee who made thee after His Own likeness. Thus
it was expressly said, “Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth
us.” <span id="fr_3737"></span>[3738](#fn_3737.md) There only can there be
security; and where security can be, there in a certain sort will be
insatiable satiety. For thou wilt neither be so satiated, as to wish to
depart; nor will anything be wanting, as though thou couldest suffer
want.
