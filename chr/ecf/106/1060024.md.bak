<span id="v.ii.xviii-p2"></span>54. But now, to conclude by summing up
this passage, what can be named or thought of more laborious and
toilsome, where the believing soul is straining every nerve of its
industry, than the subduing of vicious habit? Let such an one cut off
the members which obstruct the kingdom of heaven, and not be overwhelmed
by the pain: in conjugal fidelity let him bear with everything which,
however grievously annoying it may be, is still free from the <span
id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span id="v.ii.xviii-Page_24"></span>guilt of
unlawful corruption, *i.e.* of fornication: as, for instance, if any one
should have a wife either barren, or misshapen in body, or faulty in her
members,—either blind, or deaf, or lame, or having any other defect,—or
worn out by diseases and pains and weaknesses, and whatever else may be
thought of exceeding horrible, fornication excepted, let him endure it
for the sake of his plighted love and conjugal union; <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) and let him not only not put away such
a wife, but even if he have her not, let him not marry one who has been
divorced by her husband, though beautiful, healthy, rich, fruitful. And
if it is not lawful to do such things, much less is it to be deemed
lawful for him to come near any other unlawful embrace; and let him so
flee from fornication, as to withdraw himself from base corruption of
every sort. Let him speak the truth, and let him commend it not by
frequent oaths, but by the probity of his morals; and with respect to
the innumerable crowds of all bad habits rising up in rebellion against
him, of which, in order that all may be understood, a few have been
mentioned, let him betake himself to the citadel of Christian warfare,
and let him lay them prostrate, as if from a higher ground. But who
would venture to enter upon labours so great, unless one who is so
inflamed with the love of righteousness, that, as it were utterly
consumed with hunger and thirst, and thinking there is no life for him
till that is satisfied, he puts forth violence to obtain the kingdom of
heaven? For otherwise he will not be able bravely to endure all those
things which the lovers of this world reckon toilsome and arduous, and
altogether difficult in getting rid of bad habits. “Blessed,” therefore,
“are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall
be filled.”

<span id="v.ii.xviii-p4"></span>55. But yet, when any one encounters
difficulty in these toils, and advancing through hardships and
roughnesses surrounded with various temptations, and perceiving the
troubles of his past life rise up on this side and on that, becomes
afraid lest he should not be able to carry through what he has
undertaken, let him eagerly avail himself of the counsel that he may
obtain assistance. But what other counsel is there than this, that he
who desires to have divine help for his own infirmity should bear that
of others, and should assist it as much as possible? And so, therefore,
let us look at the precepts of mercy. The meek and the merciful man,
however, seem to be one and the same: but there is this difference, that
the meek man, of whom we have spoken above, from piety does not gainsay
the divine sentences which are brought forward against his sins, nor
those statements of God which he does not yet understand; but he confers
no benefit on him whom he does not gainsay or resist. But the merciful
man in such a way offers no resistance, that he does it for the purpose
of correcting him whom he would render worse by resisting.
