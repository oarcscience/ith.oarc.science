id="vii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Sermon XXII.</span>

<span id="vii.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>\[LXXII. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.xxiv-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xxiv-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. xii.
33](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#033.md)<span id="vii.xxiv-p3.2"></span>,
“Either make the tree good, and its fruit good,” etc.*

<span id="vii.xxiv-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xxiv-p4.1"></span>The</span> Lord Jesus hath admonished us, that
we be good trees, and that so we may be able to bear good fruits. For He
saith, “Either make the tree good, and his fruit good, or else make the
tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt, for the tree is known by his
fruit.” <span id="fr_2483"></span>[2484](#fn_2483.md) When He says, “Make
the tree good, and his fruit good;” this of course is not an admonition,
but a wholesome precept, to which obedience is necessary. But when He
saith, “Make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt;” this is not a
precept that thou shouldest do it; but an admonition, that thou
shouldest beware of it. For He spoke against those, who thought that
although they were evil, they could speak good things or have good
works. This the Lord Jesus saith is impossible. For the man himself must
first be changed, in order that his works may be changed. For if a man
abide in his evil state, he cannot have good works; if he abide in his
good state, he cannot have evil works.

<span id="vii.xxiv-p6"></span>2. But who was found good by the Lord,
since “Christ died for the ungodly”? <span
id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484.md) He found them all corrupt trees,
but to those who “believed in His Name, He gave power to become the sons
of God.” <span id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485.md) Whosoever then now
is a good man, that is, a good tree, was found corrupt, and made good.
And if when He came He had chosen to root up the corrupt trees, what
tree would have remained which did not deserve to be rooted up? But He
came first to impart <span id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486.md) mercy,
that He might afterwards exercise judgment, to whom it is said, “I will
sing unto Thee O Lord, of mercy and judgment.” <span
id="fr_2487"></span>[2488](#fn_2487.md) He gave then remission of sins to
those who believed in Him, He would not even take account with them of
past reckonings. <span id="fr_2488"></span>[2489](#fn_2488.md) He gave
remission of sins, He made them good trees. He delayed the ax, He
gave <span id="fr_2489"></span>[2490](#fn_2489.md) security.

<span id="vii.xxiv-p13"></span>3. Of this ax does John speak, saying,
“Now is the ax laid unto the root of the trees; every tree which
bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewn down, and cast into the
fire.” <span id="fr_2490"></span>[2491](#fn_2490.md) With this ax does the
Householder in the Gospel threaten, saying, “Behold these three years I
come to this tree, and find no fruit on it.” Now I must clear <span
id="fr_2491"></span>[2492](#fn_2491.md) the ground; wherefore let it be cut
down. And the husbandman intercedes, saying, “Lord, let it alone this
year also, till I shall dig about it and dung it; and if it bear fruit,
well; and if not, then Thou shalt come and cut it down.” <span
id="fr_2492"></span>[2493](#fn_2492.md) So the Lord hath visited mankind as
it were three years, that is, at three several times. The first time was
before the Law; the second under the Law; the third is now, which is the
time of grace. For if He did not visit mankind before the Law, whence
was Abel, and Enoch, and Noe, and Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, whose
Lord He was pleased to be called? And He to whom all nations belonged,
as though He were the God of three men only, said, “I am the God of
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob.” <span
id="fr_2493"></span>[2494](#fn_2493.md) But if He did not visit under the
Law, He would not have given the Law itself. After the Law, came the
very Master of the house in person; He suffered, and died, and rose
again; He gave the Holy Spirit, He made the Gospel to be preached
throughout all the world, and yet a certain tree remained unfruitful.
Still is there a certain portion of mankind, which doth not yet amend
itself. The husbandman intercedes; the Apostle prays for the people; “I
bow my knees,” he saith, “unto the Father for you, that being rooted and
grounded in love, ye may be able to comprehend with all saints what is
the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of
Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the
fulness of God.” <span id="fr_2494"></span>[2495](#fn_2494.md) By bowing
the knees, he intercedes with the Master of the house for us, that we be
not rooted up. Therefore since He must necessarily come, let us take
care that He find us fruitful. The digging about the tree is the
lowliness of the penitent. For every ditch is low. The dunging it, is
the filthy <span id="fr_2495"></span>[2496](#fn_2495.md) robe <span
id="fr_2496"></span>[2497](#fn_2496.md) of repentance. For what is more
filthy than dung; yet if well used, what more profitable?

<span id="vii.xxiv-p21"></span>4. Let each one then be a good tree; let
him not suppose that he can bear good fruit, if he remain a corrupt
tree. There will be no good fruit, but from the good tree. Change the
heart, and the work will be changed. Root out desire, plant in charity.
“For as desire is the root of <span id="page_333">p. 333</span> <span
id="vii.xxiv-Page_333"></span>all evil,” <span
id="fr_2497"></span>[2498](#fn_2497.md) so is charity the root of all good.
Why then do men fret and contend one with another, saying, “What is
good?” O that thou knewest what good is! What thou dost wish to have is
not very good; this is good which thou dost not wish to be. For thou
dost wish to have health of body; it is good indeed; yet thou canst not
think that to be any great good, which the wicked have as well. Thou
dost wish to have gold and silver; I grant that these also are good
things, but then only if thou make a good use of them; and a good use of
them thou wilt not make, if thou art evil thyself. And hence gold and
silver are to the evil evil; to the good are good, not because gold and
silver make them good; but because they find them good, they are turned
to a good use. Again, thou dost wish to have honour, it is good; but
this too only if thou make a good use of it. To how many has honour been
the occasion of destruction! And again, to how many has honour been the
instrument  <span id="fr_2498"></span>[2499](#fn_2498.md) of good works!

<span id="vii.xxiv-p24"></span>5. Let us then, if we can, make a
distinction as to these goods; for it is of good trees that we are
speaking. And here there is nothing, which every one ought so much to
think of, as to turn his eyes upon himself, to learn in himself, examine
himself, inspect himself, search into himself, and find out himself; and
kill what is displeasing; and long for and plant in that which is
well-pleasing (to God). For when a man finds himself so empty of better
goods, why is he greedy of external goods? And what profit is there in a
coffer full of goods, with an empty conscience? Thou wishest to have
good things, and dost thou not then wish to be good thyself? Seest thou
not that thou oughtest rather to blush for thy good things, if thy house
is full of good things, and thou its owner art evil? For what is there,
tell me, thou wouldest wish to have that is bad. Not any one thing I am
sure; neither wife; nor son; nor daughter; nor manservant; nor
maidservant; nor country seat; nor a coat; nay nor a shoe; <span
id="fr_2499"></span>[2500](#fn_2499.md) and yet thou art willing to have a
bad life. I pray thee prefer thy way of life to thy shoes. All things
which encompass thy sight, as being of elegance and beauty, are highly
prized by thee; and art thou so lightly esteemed by thyself, and so
devoid of beauty? If the good things of which thine house is full, which
thou hast longed to possess, and feared to lose, could make answer to
thee, would they not cry out to thee, As thou wishest to have us good,
so do we also wish to have a good owner? And now in speechless accents
do they address thy Lord against thee: “Lo! thou hast given him so many
good things, and he himself is evil. What profit is there to him in that
he hath, when he hath not Him who hath given him all!”

<span id="vii.xxiv-p26"></span>6. One then who has been admonished, and
it may be moved to compunction by these words, may ask what is good?
what is the nature of good? and whence it comes? Well is it that thou
hast understood that it is thy duty to ask this. I will answer thy
enquiries, and will say, “That is good which thou canst not lose against
thy will.” For gold thou mayest lose even against thy will; and so thou
canst a house; and honours, and even the health of the body; but the
good whereby thou art truly good, thou dost neither receive against thy
will, nor against thy will dost lose it. I enquire then, “What is the
nature of this good?” One of the Psalms teaches us an important matter,
perchance it is even this that we are seeking for. For it says, “O ye
sons of men, how long will ye be heavy in heart?” <span
id="fr_2500"></span>[2501](#fn_2500.md) How long will that tree be in its
three <span id="fr_2501"></span>[2502](#fn_2501.md) years fruitlessness? “O
ye sons of men, how long will ye be heavy in heart?” What is “heavy in
heart”? “Why do ye love vanity, and seek after leasing?” And then it
goes on to say what we must really seek after; “Know ye that the Lord
hath magnified His Holy One?” <span id="fr_2502"></span>[2503](#fn_2502.md)
Now Christ hath come, now hath He been magnified, now hath He risen
again, and ascended into heaven, now is His Name preached through the
world: “How long will ye be heavy in heart?” Let the times past suffice;
now that that Holy One hath been magnified, “How long will ye be heavy
in heart?” After the three years, what remains but the ax? “How long
will ye be heavy in heart? Why do ye love vanity, and seek after
leasing?” Vain, useless, frivolous,  <span
id="fr_2503"></span>[2504](#fn_2503.md) fleeting things are these still
sought after, now that Christ the Holy One hath been so magnified? Truth
now is crying aloud, and is vanity still sought after? “How long will ye
be heavy in heart?”

<span id="vii.xxiv-p31"></span>7. With good reason is this world
severely scourged; for the world hath known now its Master’s words. “And
the servant,” He saith, “that knew not his Master’s will, and did commit
things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.” <span
id="fr_2504"></span>[2505](#fn_2504.md) Why? That he may seek after his
Master’s will. The servant then who knew not His will, this was the
world, before “He magnified His Holy One;” it was “the servant who knew
not his Master’s will,” and therefore “shall be beaten with few
stripes.” But the servant who now knoweth his Master’s will, that is
now, since the Godhead “sanctified His Holy One,” and “doeth not His
will, shall be beaten with many stripes.” What marvel then, if the world
be now much beaten? “It is the servant which knew his Master’s will, and
did commit things <span id="page_334">p. 334</span> <span
id="vii.xxiv-Page_334"></span>worthy of stripes.” Let him then not
refuse to be beaten with many stripes; since if in unrighteousness he
will not hear his teacher, in righteousness must he feel his avenger. At
least, let him not murmur against Him that chasteneth him, when he sees
that he is worthy of stripes, that so he may attain <span
id="fr_2505"></span>[2506](#fn_2505.md) mercy; through Christ our Lord, who
liveth and reigneth, with God the Father and the Holy Spirit, for ever
and ever. Amen.
