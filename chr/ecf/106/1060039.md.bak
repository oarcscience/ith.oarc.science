<span id="v.iii.ix"></span>

<span id="v.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.</span>

<span id="v.iii.ix-p2"></span>30. The sixth petition is, “And
bring <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) us not into temptation.”
Some manuscripts have the word “lead,” <span
id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) which is, I judge, equivalent in
meaning: for both translations have arisen from the one Greek word which
is used. But many parties in prayer express themselves thus, “Suffer us
not to be led into temptation;” that is to say, explaining in what sense
the word “lead” is used. For God does not Himself lead, but suffers that
man to be led into temptation whom He has deprived of His assistance, in
accordance with a most hidden arrangement, and with his deserts. Often,
also, for manifest reasons, He judges him worthy of being so deprived,
and allowed to be led into temptation. But it is one thing to be led
into temptation, another to be tempted. For without temptation no one
can be proved, whether to himself, as it is written, “He that hath not
been tempted, what manner of things doth he know?” <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) or to another, as the apostle says,
“And your temptation in my flesh ye despised not:” <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) for from this circumstance he learnt
that they were stedfast, because they were not turned aside from charity
by those tribulations which had happened to the apostle according to the
flesh. For even before all temptations we are known to God, who knows
all things before they happen.

<span id="v.iii.ix-p7"></span>31. When, therefore, it is said, “The Lord
your God tempteth (proveth) you, that He may know if ye love Him,” <span
id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) the words “that He may know” are
employed for what is the real state of the case, that He may make you
know: just as we speak of a joyful day, because it makes us joyful; of a
sluggish frost, because it makes us sluggish; and of innumerable things
of the same sort, which are found either in ordinary speech, or in the
discourse of learned men, or in the Holy Scriptures. And the heretics
who <span id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span
id="v.iii.ix-Page_44"></span>are opposed to the Old Testament, not
understanding this, think that the brand of ignorance, as it were, is to
be placed upon Him of whom it is said, “The Lord your God tempteth you:”
as if in the Gospel it were not written of the Lord, “And this He said
to tempt (prove) him, for He Himself knew what He would do.” <span
id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md) For if He knew the heart of him whom
He was tempting, what is it that He wished to see by tempting him? But
in reality, that was done in order that he who was tempted might become
known to himself, and that he might condemn his own despair, on the
multitudes being filled with the Lord’s bread, while he had thought they
had not enough to eat.

<span id="v.iii.ix-p10"></span>32. Here, therefore, the prayer is not,
that we should not be tempted, but that we should not be brought into
temptation: as if, were it necessary that any one should be examined by
fire, he should pray, not that he should not be touched by the fire, but
that he should not be consumed. For “the furnace proveth the potter’s
vessels, and the trial of tribulation righteous men.” <span
id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) Joseph therefore was tempted with the
allurement of debauchery, but he was not brought into temptation. <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) Susanna was tempted, but she was not
led or brought into temptation; <span id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md)
and many others of both sexes: but Job most of all, in regard to whose
admirable stedfastness in the Lord his God, those heretical enemies of
the Old Testament, when they wish to mock at it with sacrilegious mouth,
brandish this above other weapons, that Satan begged that he should be
tempted. <span id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) For they put the
question to unskilful men by no means able to understand such things,
how Satan could speak with God: not understanding (for they cannot,
inasmuch as they are blinded by superstition and controversy) that God
does not occupy space by the mass of His corporeity; and thus exist in
one place, and not in another, or at least have one part here, and
another elsewhere: but that He is everywhere present in His majesty, not
divided by parts, but everywhere complete. But if they take a fleshly
view of what is said, “The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my
footstool,” <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md) —to which passage
our Lord also bears testimony, when He says, “Swear not at all: neither
by heaven, for it is God’s throne; nor by the earth, for it is His
footstool,” <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) —what wonder if the
devil, being placed on earth, stood before the feet of God, and spoke
something in His presence? For when will they be able to understand that
there is no soul, however wicked, which can yet reason in any way, in
whose conscience God does not speak? For who but God has written the law
of nature in the hearts of men?—that law concerning which the apostle
says: “For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto
themselves: which show the work of the law written in their hearts,
their conscience also bearing them witness, <span
id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md) and their thoughts <span
id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md) the meanwhile accusing or else
excusing one another, in the day when the Lord <span
id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) shall judge the secrets of men.” <span
id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323.md) And therefore, as in the case of every
rational soul, which thinks and reasons, even though blinded by passion,
we attribute whatever in its reasoning is true, not to itself but to the
very light of truth by which, however faintly, it is according to its
capacity illuminated, so as to perceive some measure of truth by its
reasoning; what wonder if the depraved spirit of the devil, perverted
though it be by lust, should be represented as having heard from the
voice of God Himself, *i.e.* from the voice of the very Truth, whatever
true thought it has entertained about a righteous man whom it was
proposing to tempt? But whatever is false is to be attributed to that
lust from which he has received the name of devil. Although it is also
the case that God has often spoken by means of a corporeal and visible
creature whether to good or bad, as being Lord and Governor of all, and
Disposer according to the merits of every deed: as, for instance, by
means of angels, who appeared also under the aspect of men; and by means
of the prophets, saying, Thus saith the Lord. What wonder then, if,
though not in mere thought, at least by means of some creature fitted
for such a work, God is said to have spoken with the devil?

<span id="v.iii.ix-p21"></span>33. And let them not imagine it unworthy
of His dignity, and as it were of His righteousness, that God spoke with
him: inasmuch as He spoke with an angelic spirit, although one foolish
and lustful, just as if He were speaking with a foolish and lustful
human spirit. Or let such parties themselves tell us how He spoke with
that rich man, whose most foolish covetousness He wished to censure,
saying: “Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required  <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) of thee: then whose shall those things
be which thou hast provided?” <span id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md)
Certainly the Lord Himself says so in the Gospel, to which those
heretics, whether they will or no, bend their necks. But if they are
puzzled by this circumstance, that Satan asks from God that a righteous
man should be tempted; I do not explain how it happened, but I compel
them to explain why it is said in the Gospel by the Lord Himself to the
disciples, “Behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you
<span id="page_45">p. 45</span> <span id="v.iii.ix-Page_45"></span>as
wheat;”  <span id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md) and He says to Peter,
“But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.” <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md) And when they explain this to me, they
explain to themselves at the same time that which they question me
about. But if they should not be able to explain this, let them not dare
with rashness to blame in any book what they read in the Gospel without
offence.

<span id="v.iii.ix-p26"></span>34. Temptations, therefore, take place by
means of Satan not by his power, but by the Lord’s permission, either
for the purpose of punishing men for their sins, or of proving and
exercising them in accordance with the Lord’s compassion. And there is a
very great difference in the nature of the temptations into which each
one may fall. For Judas, who sold his Lord, did not fall into one of the
same nature as Peter fell into, when, under the influence of terror, he
denied his Lord. There are also temptations common to man, I believe,
when every one, though well disposed, yet yielding to human frailty,
falls into error in some plan, or is irritated against a brother, in the
earnest endeavour to bring him round to what is right, yet a little more
than Christian calmness demands: concerning which temptations the
apostle says, “There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common
to man;” while he says at the same time, “But God is faithful, who will
not suffer <span id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328.md) you to be tempted
above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to
escape, that ye may be able to bear <span
id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329.md) it.” <span
id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330.md) And in that sentence he makes it
sufficiently evident that we are not to pray that we may not be tempted,
but that we may not be led into temptation. For we are led into
temptation, if such temptations have happened to us as we are not able
to bear. But when dangerous temptations, into which it is ruinous for us
to be brought and led, arise either from prosperous or adverse temporal
circumstances, no one is broken down by the irksomeness of adversity,
who is not led captive by the delight of prosperity. <span
id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md)

<span id="v.iii.ix-p31"></span>35. The seventh and last petition is,
“But deliver us from evil.” <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332.md) For
we are to pray not only that we may not be led into the evil from which
we are free, which is asked in the sixth place; but that we may also be
delivered from that into which we have been already led. And when this
has been done, nothing will remain terrible, nor will any temptation at
all have to be feared. And yet in this life, so long as we carry about
our present mortality, into which we were led by the persuasion of the
serpent, it is not to be hoped that this can be the case; but yet we are
to hope that at some future time it will take place: and this is the
hope which is not seen, of which the apostle, when speaking, said, “But
hope which is seen is not hope.” <span id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md)
But yet the wisdom which is granted in this life also, is not to be
despaired of by the faithful servants of God. And it is this, that we
should with the most wary vigilance shun what we have understood, from
the Lord’s revealing it, is to be shunned; and that we should with the
most ardent love seek after what we have understood, from the Lord’s
revealing it, is to be sought after. For thus, after the remaining
burden of this mortality has been laid down in the act of dying, there
shall be perfected in every part of man at the fit time, the blessedness
which has been begun in this life, and which we have from time to time
strained every nerve to lay hold of and secure.
