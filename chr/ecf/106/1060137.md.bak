<span id="vi.v.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL.—Of the Question as to Whether
There is Any Discrepancy Between Matthew on the One Hand, and Mark and
Luke on the Other, in Regard to the Order in Which the Notice is Given
of the Occasion on Which His Mother and His Brethren Were Announced to
Him.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xli-p2"></span>87. Matthew then proceeds with his
narrative in the following terms: “While He yet talked to the people,
behold, His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring to speak to
Him;” and so on, down to the words, “For whosoever shall do the will of
my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and
mother.” <span id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020.md) Without doubt, we
ought to understand this to have occurred in immediate sequence on the
preceding incidents. For he has prefaced his transition to this
narrative by the words, “While He yet talked to the people;” and what
does this term “yet” refer to, but to the very matter of which He was
speaking on that occasion? For the expression is not, “When He talked to
the people, Behold, His mother and His brethren;” but, “While He was yet
speaking,” etc. And that phraseology compels us to suppose that it was
at the very time when He was still engaged in speaking of those things
which were mentioned immediately above. For Mark has also related what
our Lord said after His declaration on the subject of the blasphemy
against the Holy Spirit. He gives it thus: “And there came His mother
and His brethren,” <span id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021.md) omitting
certain matters which meet us in the context connected with that
discourse of the Lord, and which Matthew has introduced there with
greater fulness than Mark, and Luke, again, with greater fulness than
Matthew. On the other hand, Luke has not kept the historical order in
the report which he offers of this incident, but has given it by
anticipation, and has narrated it as he recalled it to memory, at a
point antecedent to the date of its literal occurrence. But furthermore,
he has brought it in in such a manner that it appears dissociated from
any close connection either with what precedes it or with what follows
it. For, after reporting certain of the Lord’s parables, he has
introduced his notice of what took place with His mother and His
brethren in the following manner: “Then came to Him His mother and His
brethren, and could not come at Him for the press.” <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022.md) Thus he has not explained at what
precise time it was that they came to Him. And again, when he passes off
from this subject, he proceeds in these terms: “Now it came to pass on
one of the days, that He went into a ship with His disciples.” <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023.md) And certainly, when he employs this
expression, “it came to pass on one of the days,” he indicates clearly
enough that we are under no necessity of supposing that the day meant
was the very day on which this incident took place, or the one following
in immediate succession. Consequently, neither in the matter of the
Lord’s words, nor in that of the historical order of the occurrences
related, does Matthew’s account of the incident which occurred in
connection with the mother and the brethren of the Lord, exhibit any
want of harmony with the versions given of the same by the other two
evangelists.
