<span id="vii.xxiii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xxiii-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. xii.
32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032.md)<span id="vii.xxiii-p3.2"></span>,
“Whosoever shall speak a word against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be
forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.” Or,
“on the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost.”*

<span id="vii.xxiii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xxiii-p4.1"></span>There</span> has been a great question raised
touching the late lesson of the Gospel, to the solution of which I am
unequal by any power of mine own; but “our sufficiency is of God,” <span
id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334.md) to whatever degree we are capable
of receiving His aid. First then consider the magnitude of the question;
that when ye see the weight of it laid upon my shoulders, ye may pray in
aid of my labours, and in the assistance which is vouchsafed to me, may
find edification for your own souls. When “one possessed with a devil
was brought to the Lord, blind and dumb, and He had healed him so that
he could speak and see, and all the people were amazed and said, Is not
this the Son of David? the Pharisees hearing it said, This fellow doth
not cast out devils but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. But Jesus
knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against
itself shall be brought to desolation, and every city or house divided
against itself shall not stand. And if Satan cast out Satan, he is
divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?” <span
id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335.md) In these words He wished it to be
understood from their own confession, that, through their not believing
in Him they had chosen to belong to the kingdom of the devil, which as
being divided against itself could accordingly not stand. Let then the
Pharisees make choice of which they will. If Satan cannot cast out
Satan, they can find nothing to say against the Lord; but if he can,
then let them much more look to themselves, and depart out of his
kingdom, which as being divided against itself cannot stand.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p7"></span>2. But now that they may not think that
it is the prince of the devils in whom the Lord Jesus Christ casteth out
devils, let them attend to what follows; “And if I,” He saith, “by
Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out?
Therefore shall they be your judges.” <span
id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336.md) He spoke this undoubtedly of his
disciples, the “children” of that people; who as being the disciples of
the Lord Jesus Christ were well conscious that they had learnt no evil
arts from their Good Master, that through the prince of the devils they
should cast out devils. “Therefore,” He saith, “shall they be your
judges.” They, He saith, the base and contemptible things of this world,
in whom none of this artificial malice, but the holy simplicity of My
power  <span id="fr_2337"></span>[2338](#fn_2337.md) is seen; they shall be
My witnesses, they shall be your judges. Then He subjoins, “But if I by
the Spirit of God cast out devils, then the kingdom of God is come unto
you.” <span id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338.md) What is this? “If I by
the Spirit of God cast out devils,” He saith, and your children, to whom
I have given no hurtful and deceitful doctrine but a simple faith, can
in no other way cast them out; no doubt the kingdom of God is come unto
you; whereby the kingdom of the devil is subverted, and ye also are
subverted with it.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p11"></span>3. And after that He had said, “By whom
do your children cast them out?” to show that in them it was His grace,
not their own desert; He saith, “Or else how can one enter into a strong
man’s house and spoil his goods, except He first bind the strong man,
and then He will spoil his house?” <span
id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339.md) Your children, saith He, who either
have already believed in Me, or who shall yet believe, and cast out
devils, not through the prince of the devils, but through the simplicity
of holiness, who assuredly either once were, or still are what ye are
also, sinners and ungodly; and so in the house of the devil, and the
vessels of the devil, how could they be rescued from him whom he held so
firmly through the iniquity <span id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span
id="vii.xxiii-Page_319"></span>which reigned over them, unless he were
bound by the chains of My justice, that I might take away from him his
vessels which once were vessels of wrath, and make them vessels of
mercy? This it is which the blessed Apostle also says when he rebukes
the proud, and those who boast as it were of their own deserts, “For who
maketh thee to differ?” <span id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340.md) That
is, who maketh thee to differ from the mass of perdition derived from
Adam and from the vessels of wrath. And that no man might say, “My own
righteousness,” he says, “What hast thou, that thou didst not receive?”
And on this point he says of himself also, “We also once were by nature
the children of wrath, even as others.” <span
id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341.md) So then he himself was a vessel in
the house of that strong one, strong in evil, when he was a persecutor
of the Church, a “blasphemer, injurious, living in malice and envy,” as
he confesses. But He who bound the strong one, took away from him this
vessel of perdition, and made it a vessel of election.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p15"></span>4. Afterwards, that the unbelievers and
ungodly, the enemies of the Christian name, might not suppose by reason
of the divers heresies and schisms of those who under the Christian name
gather together flocks of lost sheep, that the kingdom of Christ also is
divided against itself, He next adds, “He that is not with Me is against
Me, and he that gathereth not with Me, scattereth abroad.” <span
id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342.md) He does not say, he who is under
the outward profession <span id="fr_2343"></span>[2344](#fn_2343.md) of My
Name; or the form of My Sacrament; but “he who is not with Me is against
Me.” Nor doth He say, he who gathereth not under the outward profession
of My Name; but “he who gathereth not with Me, scattereth abroad.”
Christ’s kingdom then is not divided against itself; but men try to
divide that which was bought with the price of the Blood of Christ. “For
the Lord knoweth them that are His. And, let every one that nameth the
Name of Christ depart from iniquity.”  <span
id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344.md) For if he depart not from iniquity,
he belongeth not to the kingdom of Christ, even though he name the Name
of Christ. To give then some illustrations for example’s sake, the
spirit of covetousness, and the spirit of luxuriousness, because the one
heaps together, and the other lavishes, are divided against themselves;
yet they belong both to the kingdom of the devil. Among idolaters the
spirit of Juno and the spirit of Hercules, are divided against
themselves; and both belong to the kingdom of the devil. The heathen
Christ’s enemy, and the Jew Christ’s enemy, are divided against
themselves; and both belong to the kingdom of the devil. Arianus and
Photinianus both are heretics, and both are divided against themselves.
The Donatist and Maximianist <span id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345.md)
both are heretics, and both divided against themselves. All men’s vices
and errors that are contrary to each other are divided against
themselves, and all belong to the kingdom of the devil; therefore his
kingdom shall not stand. But the righteous and the ungodly, the believer
and the unbeliever, the Catholic and the heretic, are indeed divided
against themselves, but they do not belong all to the kingdom of Christ.
“The Lord knoweth them that are His.” Let no one flatter himself upon a
mere name. If he would that the Name of the Lord should profit him, let
“him that calleth upon the Name of the Lord depart from iniquity.”

<span id="vii.xxiii-p20"></span>5. But these words of the Gospel, though
they had some obscurity, which I think by the Lord’s assistance I have
explained, were yet not so difficult, as that which follows would seem
to be. “Wherefore I say unto you, all manner of sin and blasphemy shall
be forgiven unto men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be
forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man,
it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost,
it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the
world to come.” <span id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md) What then
will become of those whom the Church desires to gain? When they have
been reformed and come into the Church from whatsoever error, is the
hope in the remission of all sins that is promised them a false hope?
For who is not convicted of having spoken a word against the Holy Ghost,
before he became a Christian or a Catholic? In the first place, are not
they who are called Pagans, the worshippers of many and false gods, and
the adorers of idols, forasmuch as they say that the Lord Christ wrought
miracles by magical arts, are not they like these who said that He cast
out devils through the prince of the devils? And again, when day by day
they blaspheme our sanctification, what else blaspheme they but the Holy
Ghost? What? Do not the Jews—they who spoke concerning our Lord what
gave occasion to this very discourse—do they not even to the present day
speak a word against the Holy Ghost, by denying that He is now in
Christians, just as the others denied Him to be <span id="page_320">p.
320</span> <span id="vii.xxiii-Page_320"></span>in Christ? For not even
did they revile the Holy Ghost, by asserting either that He existed not,
or that though He existed, yet that He was not God, but a creature; or
that He had no power to cast out devils; they did not speak thus
unworthily, or anything like it, of the Holy Ghost. For the Sadducees
indeed denied the Holy Ghost; but the Pharisees maintained His existence
against their heresy, <span id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347.md) but
they denied that He was in the Lord Jesus Christ, who they thought cast
out devils through the prince of the devils, whereas He did cast them
out through the Holy Ghost. And hence, both Jews and whatsoever heretics
there are who confess the Holy Ghost, but deny that He is in the Body of
Christ, which is His One Only Church, none other than the One Catholic
Church, are without doubt like the Pharisees who at that time although
they confessed the existence of the Holy Ghost, yet denied that He was
in Christ, whose works in casting out devils they attributed to the
prince of devils. I say nothing of the fact that some heretics either
boldly maintain that the Holy Ghost is not the Creator but a creature,
as the Arians, and Eunomians, and Macedonians, or so entirely deny His
existence, as to deny that God is Trinity, but assert that He is God the
Father only, and that He is sometimes called the Son, and sometimes the
Holy Ghost; as the Sabellians, whom some call Patripassians, because
they hold that the Father suffered; and forasmuch as they deny that He
has any Son, without doubt they deny His Holy Spirit also. The
Photinians again who say that the Father only is God, and the Son a mere
man, deny altogether that there is any third Person of the Holy Ghost.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p23"></span>6. It is plain then that the Holy Ghost
is blasphemed both by Pagans, and by Jews, and by heretics. Are they
then to be left, and accounted without all hope, since the sentence is
fixed, “Whosoever speaketh a word against the Holy Ghost it shall not be
forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come”? and
are they only to be deemed free from the guilt of this most grievous sin
who are Catholics from infancy? For all those who have believed the word
of God, that they might become Catholics, came surely into the grace and
peace of Christ, either from among the Pagans, or Jews, or heretics: and
if there be no pardon for them for the word which they have spoken
against the Holy Ghost, in vain do we promise and preach to men, to turn
to God, and receive peace and remission of sins, whether in Baptism or
in the Church. For it is not said, “It shall not be forgiven him except
in baptism;” but, “it shall not be forgiven, neither in this world,
neither in the world to come.”

<span id="vii.xxiii-p24"></span>7. Some think that they only sin against
the Holy Ghost, who having been washed in the laver of regeneration in
the Church, and having received the Holy Spirit, as though unthankful
for so great a gift of the Saviour, have plunged themselves afterwards
into any deadly sin; as adultery, or murder, or an absolute
apostasy, <span id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348.md) either altogether
from the Christian name, or from the Catholic Church. But how this sense
of it may be proved, I know not; since the place of repentance is not
denied in the Church to any sins whatever; and the Apostle says that
heretics themselves are to be reproved to this end, “If God peradventure
will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; And that
they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken
captive by him at his will.”  <span id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349.md)
For what is the advantage of amendment without any hope of forgiveness?
Finally, The Lord did not say, “the baptized <span
id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350.md) Catholic who shall speak a word
against the Holy Ghost;” but “he who,” that is whosoever speaketh, be he
who he may, “it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world,
neither in the world to come.” Whether then he be a heathen, or a Jew,
or a Christian, or a heretic from among Jews or Christians, or
whatsoever other title of error he have, it is not said, this man, or
that man; but “whosoever speaketh a word against the Holy Ghost,” that
is who blasphemeth the Holy Ghost, “it shall not be forgiven him,
neither in this world, neither in the world to come.” But moreover if
every error contrary to truth, and inimical to Christian peace, as we
have shown before, “speaketh a word against the Holy Ghost;” and yet the
Church doth not cease to reform and gather out of every error those who
shall receive remission of sins, and the Holy Ghost Himself, whom they
have blasphemed; I think I have discovered an important secret for the
clearing up this so great a question. Let us seek then from the Lord the
light of explanation.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p28"></span>8. Lift up then, Brethren, lift up unto
me your ears, and your hearts unto the Lord. I tell you, my Beloved;
perhaps there is not in all holy Scripture found a more important or
more difficult question. Wherefore (that I may make you a confession
about myself), I have always in my discourses to the people avoided the
difficulty and embarrassment of this question; not because I had no
ideas of any sort on the subject, for in a matter of such great
importance, I would not be negligent in “asking,” and “seeking,” and
“knocking;” but because I did not think I could do justice <span
id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351.md) to that understanding of it which
was in some degree opened to me, by words suggested at the moment. <span
id="page_321">p. 321</span> <span id="vii.xxiii-Page_321"></span>But as
I listened to to-day’s lesson, upon which it was my duty to discourse to
you, as the Gospel was being read, there was such a beating at my heart,
that I believed that it was God’s will that you should hear something on
the subject by my ministry.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p30"></span>9. First then, I pray you to consider
and understand that the Lord did not say, “No blasphemy of the Spirit
shall be forgiven,” or, “whosoever speaketh any word whatsoever against
the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him;” but “whosoever speaketh a
word;” <span id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352.md) for had he said the
former, there would have remained to us no subject of disputation at
all. Since if no blasphemy, and no word which is spoken against the Holy
Ghost, shall be forgiven unto men; the Church could not gain any one out
of all the classes of ungodly sinners who gainsay the gift of Christ,
and the sanctification of the Church, whether Jews, or heathens, or
heretics of whatsoever sort, and some even of little <span
id="fr_2353"></span>[2354](#fn_2353.md) knowledge in the Catholic Church
itself. But God forbid that the Lord should say this: God forbid, I say,
that the Truth should say that every blasphemy and every word which
should be spoken against the Holy Ghost, hath no forgiveness neither in
this world, neither in the world to come.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p33"></span>10. His will indeed was to exercise us
by the difficulty of the question, not to deceive us by a false
decision. Wherefore there is no necessity for any one to think, that
every blasphemy or every word which is spoken against the Holy Ghost
hath no remission; but necessary it plainly is, that there should be
some certain blasphemy, and some word which if it be spoken against the
Holy Ghost can never attain <span id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354.md)
to pardon and forgiveness. For if we take it to mean “every word,” who
then can be saved? But if again we think there is no such “word,” we
contradict the Saviour. There is then without doubt some certain
blasphemy and some word which if it be spoken against the Holy Ghost,
shall not be forgiven. Now what this word is, it is the Lord’s will we
should enquire; and therefore He hath not expressed it. His will, I say,
was that it should be enquired into, not denied. For the style of the
Scriptures is often such, that when anything is so expressed as not to
be limited either to a universal or particular signification, it is not
necessary that it should be understood universally, and not
particularly. This proposition then would be expressed in its whole
extent, that is, universally, if it were said, “All blasphemy <span
id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355.md) of the Spirit shall not be
forgiven;” or, “Whosoever speaketh any word whatsoever against the Holy
Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in
the world to come.” But it would be expressed partially, that is,
particularly, if it were said, “Some certain blasphemy of the Spirit
shall not be forgiven.” But because this proposition is laid down
neither in a universal, nor a particular form (for it is not said,
“Every blasphemy;” or some certain blasphemy of the Spirit; but only
indefinitely, “blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven;” neither
is it said, “Whosoever speaketh any word whatever,” or “whosoever
speaketh some certain word,” but indefinitely, “whosoever speaketh a
word”), there is no necessity that we should understand “every blasphemy
and every word;” but necessary it plainly is that the Lord designed some
kind of blasphemy, and some word to be understood; though He would not
express it, that, if we should receive any right understanding of it by
asking, and seeking, and knocking, we might not entertain a low esteem
of it.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p36"></span>11. In order to seeing this more
plainly, consider that which the same Lord also saith of the Jews, “If I
had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin.” <span
id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356.md) For this again was not said with
any such meaning, as if He intended it to be understood that the Jews
would have been without any sin at all, if He had not come and spoken to
them. For indeed He found them full of and laden with sins. Wherefore He
saith, “Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden.” <span
id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357.md) Laden! with what, but with the
burdens of sins and transgressions of the Law? “For the Law entered that
sin might abound.” <span id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358.md) Since then
He saith Himself in another place, “I came not to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance;” <span id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359.md)
how would “they not have had sin if He had not come”? if it be not that
this proposition being expressed neither universally, nor particularly,
but indefinitely, does not constrain us to understand it of all sin? But
certainly unless we understand that there was some sin which they would
not have had if Christ had not come and spoken unto them, we must say
that the proposition was false, which God forbid. He doth not say then,
“If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had had no sin;” lest the
Truth should lie. Nor again did He say definitely, “If I had not come
and spoken unto them, they had not had some certain sin;” lest our
devout earnestness <span id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360.md) should not
be exercised. For in the full abundance of the Holy Scriptures we feed
upon the plain parts, we are exercised by the obscure: by the one,
hunger is driven away, and daintiness <span
id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361.md) by the other. Seeing then that it
is not <span id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span
id="vii.xxiii-Page_322"></span>said, “they had had no sin,” we need not
be disturbed, though we acknowledge that the Jews would have been
sinners, even if the Lord had not come. But yet because it is said, “If
I had not come, they had not had sin;” it must needs be that they
contracted, though not all, yet some sin which they had not before, from
the coming of the Lord. And this verily is that sin, that they believed
not in Him who was present with and spake to them, and that counting Him
as an enemy because He spake the truth, they put Him besides to death.
This sin so great and terrible it is clear they had not had if He had
not come and spoken to them. As then when we hear the words, “They had
not had sin;” we do not understand all, but some, sin; so when we hear
in to-day’s lesson, “Blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven;” we
understand not all, but a certain kind of blasphemy; and when we hear,
“Whosoever speaketh a word against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
forgiven him;” we ought not to understand every, but some certain word.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p43"></span>12. For in that He saith also in this
very text, “But blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven;” surely
we must needs understand not blasphemy of every spirit, but the Holy
Spirit. And though He had not expressed this anywhere else more plainly,
who could be so silly as to understand it in any other way? According to
the same rule of speech is this expression also understood, “Except a
man be born of water and of the Spirit.”  <span
id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362.md) For He doth not say in that place,
and of the Holy Spirit; yet this is understood. Nor because He said of
water and of the Spirit, is any one forced to understand it of every
spirit. Wherefore when you hear, “But the blasphemy of the Spirit shall
not be forgiven;” as you must not understand it of every spirit, so not
of every blasphemy against the Spirit.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p45"></span>13. I see that you are now wishing to
hear, since it is not every blasphemy of the Spirit, what that blasphemy
is which shall not be forgiven, and what that word is, since it is not
every word which if it shall be spoken against the Holy Ghost, shall not
be forgiven neither in this world, neither in the world to come. And for
my part I should be willing to tell you at once, what you are so very
intently waiting to hear; but bear for a while the delay which a more
careful diligence requires, till by the Lord’s assistance I shall unfold
the whole meaning of the passage before us. Now the other two
Evangelists, Mark and Luke, when they spake of the same thing, did not
say “blasphemy” or “a word,” that we might understand it not of every
blasphemy, but of some sort of blasphemy; not every word, but some
certain word. What then did they say? In Mark it is thus written,
“Verily I say unto you, all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men,
and blasphemies, where-withsoever they shall blaspheme. But he that
shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath never forgiveness, but
shall be held guilty of an eternal offence.” <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363.md) In Luke it is thus: “And whosoever
shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but
unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
forgiven.” <span id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364.md) Is there any
departure from the truth of the same proposition because of some
diversity in the expression? For indeed there is no other reason why the
Evangelists do not relate the same things in the same way, but that we
may learn thereby to prefer things to words, not words to things, and to
seek for nothing else in the speaker, but for his intention, to convey
which only the words are used. For what real difference is there whether
it is said, “Blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven;” or “he that
blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him.”
Except perhaps that the same thing is declared more plainly in this last
than in the other form; and so one Evangelist does not overthrow, but
explains the other. Now “blasphemy of the Spirit” is an unevident <span
id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365.md) expression; because it is not
directly said what spirit; for every spirit is not the Holy Spirit. Thus
it might be called “blasphemy of the spirit,” when a man blasphemes with
the spirit; as that may be called “prayer of the spirit,” when one prays
with the spirit. Whence the Apostle says, “I will pray with the spirit,
and I will pray with the understanding also.” <span
id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md) But when it is said, “he that shall
blaspheme against the Holy Ghost,” these ambiguities are removed. So the
expression, “hath never forgiveness, but shall be held guilty of an
eternal offence;” what is it, but what according to Matthew is
expressed, “it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither
in the world to come”? The very same idea is expressed in different
words and different forms of speech. And what is in Matthew, “Whosoever
speaketh a word against the Holy Ghost,” that we might not understand it
of anything but blasphemy, others have more clearly expressed, “He that
shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost.” Yet the same thing is said by
all; nor did any one of them depart from the intention of the Speaker,
for the sake of understanding which only are words spoken, and written,
and read, and heard.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p50"></span>14. But one may say, See I have admitted
and understood that where the word “blasphemy” is used, and neither all,
nor some certain blasphemy expressed, it may be understood <span
id="page_323">p. 323</span> <span id="vii.xxiii-Page_323"></span>either
of all, or of some certain blasphemy, but not necessarily of all; but
again if it be not understood of some, that that which is said would be
untrue: so again if it is not said every or some certain word, it is not
necessary that every word should be understood, but unless some word be
understood, in no way can what is said be true. But when we read, “He
that shall blaspheme,” how can I understand any certain blasphemy, when
the word “blasphemy” is not used, or any certain word, when the word
“word” is not used, but it seems to be said as it were generally, “He
that shall blaspheme.” To this objection <span
id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) I reply thus. If it were said in
this passage also, “He that shall blaspheme with any kind of blasphemy
whatever against the Holy Ghost,” there would be no reason why we should
think that some particular blasphemy was to be sought for, when we ought
rather to understand all blasphemy; but because all blasphemy could not
be meant, lest the hope of forgiveness in case of their amendment should
be taken away from heathens, and Jews, and heretics, and all kinds of
men, who by their divers errors and contradictions blaspheme against the
Holy Ghost; it remains without a doubt, that in the passage where it is
written, “He that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never
forgiveness,” he must be meant, not who hath in any way whatever
blasphemed; but he who hath blasphemed in such a particular way, that he
can never be pardoned.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p52"></span>15. For as in that it is said, “God
tempteth no man,” <span id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368.md) it is not
to be understood that God tempteth no man with any kind, but only not
with some certain kind of temptation; lest that be false, which is
written, “The Lord your God tempteth you;” <span
id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369.md) and lest we deny that Christ is
God, or say that the Gospel is false, when we read that He asked His
disciple “tempting him; but He Himself knew what He would do.” <span
id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370.md) For there is a temptation which
induces to sin, with which “God tempteth no man,” and there is a
temptation which only proves our faith, with which even God vouchsafes
to tempt. So when we hear, “He that shall blaspheme against the Holy
Ghost,” we must not take it of every kind of blasphemy, as neither in
the other place, of every kind of temptation.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p56"></span>16. So again when we hear, “He that
believeth and is baptized shall be saved;” <span
id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371.md) we do not of course understand it
of one who believes in such a way “as the devils believe and
tremble;” <span id="fr_2372"></span>[2373](#fn_2372.md) nor of those who
receive baptism in such sort as Simon Magus, <span
id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373.md) who though he could be baptized,
could not be saved. As then when He said, “He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved,” He had not in his view all who believe and are
baptized, but some only; those, to wit, who are settled in that faith,
which, according to the Apostle’s distinction, “worketh by love:” <span
id="fr_2374"></span>[2375](#fn_2374.md) so when he said, “He that shall
blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness,” he did not
intend every kind, but a specific sin of blasphemy against the Holy
Ghost, by which whosoever shall be bound, he shall never by any
remission be loosed.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p61"></span>17. That expression also of His, “He
that eateth My Flesh and drinketh My Blood dwelleth in Me, and I in
him,” <span id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375.md) how must we understand?
Can we include in these words those even of whom the Apostle says, “that
they eat and drink judgment to themselves;” <span
id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376.md) when they eat this flesh and drink
this blood? What! did Judas the impious seller and betrayer of his
Master <span id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377.md) (though, as Luke the
Evangelist declares more plainly, he ate and drank with the rest of His
disciples this first Sacrament of His body and blood, consecrated <span
id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378) by the Lord’s hands.md), did he “dwell
in Christ and Christ in him”? Do so many, in fine, who either in
hypocrisy eat that flesh and drink that blood, or who after they have
eaten and drunk become apostate, do they “dwell in Christ or Christ in
them”? Yet assuredly there is a certain manner of eating that Flesh and
drinking that Blood, in which whosoever eateth and drinketh, “he
dwelleth in Christ and Christ in him.” As then he doth not “dwell in
Christ and Christ in him,” who “eateth the Flesh and drinketh the Blood
of Christ” in any manner whatsoever, but only in some certain manner, to
which He doubtless had regard when He spake these words. So in this
expression also, “He that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath
never forgiveness,” he is not guilty of this unpardonable sin, who shall
blaspheme in any way whatever, but in that particular way, which it is
His will, who uttered this true and terrible sentence, that we should
seek out and understand.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p66"></span>18. Now as to what that mode, or
immoderateness <span id="fr_2379"></span>[2380](#fn_2379.md) rather, of
blasphemy is, what that particular blasphemy, and what that word against
the Holy Ghost, the order of my discourse requires me to say what I
think, and not to put off any longer your expectation which has been so
long but so necessarily deferred. Ye know, Dearly beloved, that in that
invisible and incorruptible Trinity, which our faith and the Church
Catholic maintains and preaches, God the Father is not the Father of the
Holy Spirit, but of the Son; and that God the Son is not the Son of the
Holy Spirit, but of the Father; but that God the Holy Spirit is the
Spirit not of <span id="page_324">p. 324</span> <span
id="vii.xxiii-Page_324"></span>the Father only, or of the Son only, but
of the Father and the Son. And that this Trinity, although the <span
id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380.md) Property and particular <span
id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381.md) Subsistence <span
id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382.md) of each person is preserved, is
yet, because of the undivided and inseparable Essence or Nature of
Eternity, <span id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383.md) Truth, and
Goodness, not three Gods but One God. And by this means, according to
our capacity, and as far as it is granted us to see these things
“through a glass darkly,” especially being such as we now are, there is
conveyed to <span id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384.md) us the idea of
Origination <span id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385.md) in the Father,
Nativity in the Son, and the Communion of the Father and the Son in the
Holy Spirit, and in the Three Equality. By That then which is the Bond
of communion <span id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386.md) between the
Father and the Son, it is Their pleasure that we should have communion
both among ourselves and with Them, and to gather us together in one by
that same Gift, which One They both have, that is, by the Holy Spirit,
at once God and the Gift of God. For in This are we reconciled to the
Divinity, and take delight in It. For what would the knowledge of
whatever good we know profit us, unless we also loved it? But as it is
by the truth that we learn, so is it by charity that we love, that so we
may attain also to a fuller knowledge, and enjoy in blessedness what we
know. “Love moreover is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
which is given unto us.” <span id="fr_2387"></span>[2388](#fn_2387.md) And
because it is through sin that we are alienated from the possession of
true good, “Love covereth a multitude of sins.” <span
id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388.md) So then the Father is Himself the
True Origin <span id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389.md) to the Son, who
is the Truth, and the Son is the Truth, originating <span
id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390.md) from the True Father, and the Holy
Spirit is Goodness, shed abroad <span
id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391.md) from the Good Father and the Good
Son; but in all Three the Divinity is equal, and the Unity Inseparable.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p80"></span>19. First then in order to our receiving
eternal life which shall be given at the last, there comes to us a gift
from God’s goodness from the beginning of our faith, to wit, the
remission of sins. For while they remain, there remains in some sort
enmity against God, and alienation from Him, which comes from what is
evil in us; since Scripture does not speak falsely, which says, “Your
sins separate between you and God.” <span
id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392.md) He does not then bestow on us His
good things, except He take away our evil things. And the former
increase in proportion as the latter are diminished; nor will the one be
perfected, till the other be brought to an end. But now that the Lord
Jesus forgives sins by the Holy Ghost, just as by the Holy Ghost He
casts out devils, may be understood by this, that after His Resurrection
from the dead, when He had said to His disciples, “Receive ye the Holy
Ghost,” He immediately subjoined, “Whosesoever sins ye remit, they shall
be remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they shall be
retained.” <span id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393.md) For that
regeneration also, in which there is a remission of all past sins, is
wrought by the Holy Ghost, as the Lord saith, “Except a man be born of
water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394.md) But it is one thing to be born of
the Spirit, another to be nourished by the Spirit; just as it is one
thing to be born of the flesh, which happens when the mother is
delivered of her child; another to be nourished by the flesh, which
happens when she gives suck to her infant, who turns himself that he may
drink with pleasure thither whence he was born, to have life; that he
may receive the support of life from thence, whence he received the
beginning of his birth. We must believe then that the first blessing of
God’s goodness in the Holy Ghost is the remission of sins. Whence the
preaching of John the Baptist, who was sent as the forerunner of the
Lord, also begins with it. For thus it is written, “In those days came
John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judæa, saying, Repent
ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” <span
id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395.md) Hence too the beginning of our
Lord’s preaching, as we read, “From that time Jesus began to preach and
to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” <span
id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396.md) Now John, amongst the other things
which he spake to those who came to be baptized by him, said, “I indeed
baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is
mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize
you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.” <span
id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397.md) The Lord also said, “John truly
baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not
many days hence,” <span id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398.md) even at
Pentecost. Now as to John’s expression, “with fire,” though tribulation
also might be understood, which believers were to suffer for the name of
Christ; yet may we reasonably think that the same Holy Spirit is
signified also under the name of “fire.” <span
id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399.md) Wherefore when He came it is said,
“And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat
upon each of them.” <span id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400.md) Hence
also the Lord Himself said, “I am come to send fire on the earth.” <span
id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401.md) Hence also the Apostle saith,
“Fervent in the spirit;” <span id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402.md) for
from <span id="page_325">p. 325</span> <span
id="vii.xxiii-Page_325"></span>Him comes the fervour of love. “For it is
shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto
us.” <span id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403.md) And the contrary to this
fervour is what the Lord said, “The love of many shall wax cold.” <span
id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404.md) Now perfect love is the perfect
gift of the Holy Spirit. But the first “gift” is that which is concerned
with the remission of sins; by which blessing “we are delivered from the
power of darkness;” <span id="fr_2405"></span>[2406](#fn_2405.md) and the
prince of this world, <span id="fr_2406"></span>[2407](#fn_2406.md) who
worketh in the children of disobedience” <span
id="fr_2407"></span>[2408](#fn_2407.md) by no other power than the
fellowship and the bond of sin, is “cast out” by our faith. For by the
Holy Spirit, by whom the people of God are gathered together into one,
is the unclean spirit who is divided against himself cast out.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p97"></span>20. Against this gratuitous gift,
against this grace of God, does the impenitent heart speak. This
impenitence then is “the blasphemy of the Spirit, which shall not be
forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.” For
against the Holy Spirit, by whom they whose sins are all forgiven are
baptized, and whom the Church hath received, that “whosesoever sins she
remits, they may be remitted,” does he speak, whether in the thought
only, or also in the tongue, a very heinous and exceedingly ungodly
word, who “when the patience of God leadeth him to repentance, after his
hardness and impenitent heart treasureth up unto himself wrath against
the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who
will render to every man according to his deeds.” <span
id="fr_2408"></span>[2409](#fn_2408.md) This impenitence then, for so by
some one general name may we call both this blasphemy and the word
against the Holy Ghost which hath no forgiveness for ever; this
impenitence, I say, against which both the herald and the Judge cried
out, saying, “Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand;” <span
id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409.md) against which the Lord first opened
the mouth of the Gospel preaching, and against which He foretold that
the same Gospel was to be preached in all the world, when He said to His
disciples after His resurrection from the dead, “it behoved Christ to
suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and
remission of sins should be preached in His Name among all nations,
beginning at Jerusalem:” <span id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410.md) this
impenitence, in one word, hath no forgiveness “neither in this world,
nor in the world to come;” for that repentance only obtaineth
forgiveness in this world, that it may have its effect in the world to
come.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p101"></span>21. But this impenitence or impenitent
heart may not be pronounced <span id="fr_2411"></span>[2412](#fn_2411.md)
upon, as long as a man lives in the flesh. For we are not to despair of
any so long as “the patience of God leadeth the ungodly to repentance,”
and doth not hurry him out of this life; “God, who willeth not the death
of a sinner, but that he should return from his ways and live.” <span
id="fr_2412"></span>[2413](#fn_2412.md) He is a heathen today; but how
knowest thou whether he may not be a Christian to-morrow? He is a
heretic to-day; but what if to-morrow he follow the Catholic truth? He
is a schismatic to-day; but what if to-morrow he embrace Catholic peace?
What if they, whom thou observest now in any kind of error that can be,
and whom thou condemnest as in most desperate case, what if before they
end this life, they repent and find the true life in that which is to
come? Wherefore, Brethren, let also what the Apostle says urge you to
this. “Judge nothing before the time.” <span
id="fr_2413"></span>[2414](#fn_2413.md) For this blasphemy of the Spirit,
for which there is no forgiveness (which I have understood to be not
every kind of blasphemy, but a particular sort, and that as I have said
or discovered, or even as I think clearly shown to be the case, the
persevering hardness of an impenitent heart), cannot be taken hold of in
any one, I repeat it, as long as he is still in this life.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p105"></span>22. And let it not seem absurd, that
whereas a man who perseveres in hardened impenitence even to the end of
this life, speaks long and much against this grace of the Holy Spirit;
yet the Gospel has called this so long contradiction of an impenitent
heart, as though it were something of short duration, “a word,” saying,
“Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven
him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.” For
though this blasphemy be long continued, and made up of, and drawn out
at length in very many words, yet it is the manner of Scripture to call
even many words “a word.” For no prophet ever spoke one word only; yet
we read, “the *word* which came to such and such a prophet.” And the
Apostle says, “Let the elders be counted worthy of double honour,
especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.”  <span
id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414.md) He does not say, “in words,” but,
“in the word.” And St. James, “Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers
only.” <span id="fr_2415"></span>[2416](#fn_2415.md) He again does not say,
“of the words,” but, “of the word;” although so many words out of the
Holy Scriptures are read, and spoken, and heard in the Church at her
celebrations and solemnities. As therefore, how long a time soever any
of us have laboured in preaching the Gospel, he is not called a preacher
of the words, but of the word; and how long time soever any of you may
have attentively and <span id="page_326">p. 326</span> <span
id="vii.xxiii-Page_326"></span>diligently listened to our preaching, he
is called a most earnest “hearer” not of the words, but “of the word;”
so after the style of the Scripture and the custom of the Church, whoso
throughout his whole life in the flesh, to whatever length it may be
extended, shall have spoken no matter how many words, whether by mouth,
or the thought only with an impenitent heart, against that remission of
sins which is granted in the Church, he speaks “a word” against the Holy
Ghost.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p108"></span>23. Therefore not only every word
spoken against the Son of Man, but, in fact, every sin and blasphemy
shall be forgiven unto men; because where there is not this sin of an
impenitent heart against the Holy Ghost, by whom sins are remitted in
the Church, all other sins are forgiven. But how shall that sin be
forgiven, which hinders the forgiveness of other sins also? All sins
then are forgiven to them in whom is not this sin, which shall never be
forgiven; but to him in whom it is, since this sin is never forgiven,
neither are other sins forgiven; because the remission of all is
hindered by the bond of this one. It is not then that “whosoever
speaketh a word against the Son of Man shall be forgiven,” but “whoso
speaketh against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven,” for that in the
Trinity the Holy Ghost is greater than the Son, which no heretic even
has ever maintained; but since whosoever he be that resisteth the truth
and blasphemeth the Truth, which is Christ, even after such a
manifestation of Himself among men, as that the Word who is the Son of
Man and very Christ, “became flesh and dwelt among us;” if he have not
also spoken that word of the impenitent heart against the Holy Ghost, of
whom it is said, “Except a man be born of water and of the
Spirit;” <span id="fr_2416"></span>[2417](#fn_2416.md) and again, “Receive
ye the Holy Ghost; whosesoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto
them;” <span id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417.md) that is, if he shall
repent, he shall thereby receive the gift of the remission of all his
sins, and of this also, that he “hath spoken a word against the Son of
Man,” because to the sin of ignorance, or obstinacy, or blasphemy of
whatever kind, he hath not added the sin of impenitence against the gift
of God, and the grace of regeneration or reconciliation, which is
conferred in the Church by the Holy Spirit.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p111"></span>24. Wherefore, neither must we imagine,
as some do, that the word which is spoken against the Son of Man is
forgiven, but that which is spoken against the Holy Ghost is not
forgiven, because Christ became the Son of Man by reason of His assuming
flesh, in which respect the Holy Ghost of course is greater, who in His
Own Substance is equal to the Father and the Only-begotten Son according
to His Divinity, according to which also the Only-begotten Son Himself
is equal to the Father and the Holy Spirit. For if this were the reason,
surely nothing would have been said of any other kind of blasphemy, that
that only might appear capable of forgiveness, which is spoken against
the Son of Man, regarded only as man. But forasmuch as it is first said,
“All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men;” <span
id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418.md) which in another Evangelist is also
thus expressed, “All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and
blasphemies wherewithsoever they shall blaspheme;” <span
id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419.md) without doubt, that blasphemy also
which is spoken against the Father is included in that general
expression; and yet that alone is laid down as unpardonable, which is
spoken against the Holy Ghost. What! did the Father also take the form
of a servant, that in this respect the Holy Ghost should be greater than
He? No surely: but after the universal mention of all sins and of all
blasphemy, He wished to express more prominently the blasphemy which is
spoken against the Son of Man for this reason, because although men
should be even bound in that sin which He mentioned when He said, “If I
had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin:” <span
id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420.md) which sin also in the Gospel
according to John He shows to be a very grievous one, when He says of
the Holy Spirit Himself, when He promised that He would send Him, “He
shall reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
of sin, because they believed not on Me:” <span
id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421.md) yet if that hardness of the
impenitent heart have not spoken a word against the Holy Ghost, even
this which is spoken against the Son of Man shall be forgiven.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p116"></span>25. Here perhaps some one may ask,
“whether the Holy Ghost only forgiveth sins, and not the Father and the
Son also?” I answer, Both the Father and the Son forgive them. For the
Son Himself saith of the Father, “If ye forgive men their trespasses,
your heavenly Father will also forgive you.” <span
id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422.md) And we say to Him in the Lord’s
Prayer, “Our Father, which art in heaven.” <span
id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423.md) And amongst the other petitions we
ask this, saying, “Forgive us our debts.” <span
id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424.md) And again of Himself He saith,
“That ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive
sins.” <span id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425.md) “If then,” you will
say, “The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit forgive sins, why is that
impenitence which shall never be forgiven, said to relate only to the
blasphemy of the Spirit, as though he who should be bound in this sin of
impenitence should seem to resist the gift of the Holy Spirit, because
by that gift is wrought the remission of sins?” Now on <span
id="page_327">p. 327</span> <span id="vii.xxiii-Page_327"></span>this
point, I will also ask, Whether Christ only cast out devils, or the
Father and the Holy Spirit also? For if Christ only, what means His
saying, “The Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works.” <span
id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426.md) For so it is said, “He doeth the
works,” as if the Son doeth them not, but the Father who dwelleth in the
Son. Why then in another place doth He say, “My Father worketh hitherto,
and I work.” <span id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427.md) And a little
after, “For what things soever He doeth, these also doeth the Son
likewise.” <span id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428.md) But when in
another place He says, “If I had not done amongst them the works which
none other man did,” <span id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429.md) He
speaks as if He did them alone. Now if these things are so expressed, as
that nevertheless the works of the Father and the Son are inseparable,
what must we believe of the Holy Spirit, but that He also worketh
equally with them? For in that very place, from which this question
arose which we are discussing, when the Son was casting out devils, He
yet said, “If I in the Holy Spirit cast out devils, then the kingdom of
God is come unto you.” <span id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430.md)

<span id="vii.xxiii-p126"></span>26. And here perhaps one may say, “That
the Holy Spirit is rather given by the Father and the Son, than that He
worketh anything by His own will, and that this is the scope of the
words, “In the Holy Spirit I cast out devils,” because not the Spirit
Himself, but Christ in the Spirit, did it; so that the expression, “I
cast out in the Holy Spirit,” might be understood as if it were said, “I
cast out by the Holy Spirit.” For this is the usual style of the
Scriptures, “They killed in the sword,” that is, by the sword. They
“burnt in the fire,” <span id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431.md) that is,
by the fire. “And Joshua took knives of flints, in which to circumcise,”
that is, by which to circumcise, “the children of Israel.” <span
id="fr_2432"></span>[2433](#fn_2432.md) But let those who on this account
take from the Holy Spirit His proper power, look to that which we read
to have been spoken by the Lord, “The Spirit bloweth where It
listeth.” <span id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433.md) And as to what the
Apostle says, “But all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit,
dividing to every man severally as He will;” <span
id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434.md) it might be feared, lest one
imagine that the Father and the Son do not work them: whereas amongst
these works he has expressly mentioned both the “gifts of healings,” and
the “workings of miracles,” in which surely is included also the driving
out of devils. But when he adds the words, “Dividing to every man
severally as He will;” does he not clearly show also the Power of the
Holy Spirit, yet as plainly inseparable from the Father and the Son? If
then these things are so expressed, as that notwithstanding the
operation of the Trinity is understood to be inseparable: so that when
the operation of the Father is spoken of, it is understood that He does
not exercise it without the Son, and the Holy Spirit; and when the
operation of the Son is spoken of, it is not without the Father and the
Holy Spirit; and when the operation of the Holy Spirit is spoken of, it
is not without the Father and the Son; it is sufficiently clear to those
who have a sound faith, or who even understand as they best can, both
that the words, “He doeth the works,” <span
id="fr_2435"></span>[2436](#fn_2435.md) are spoken of the Father, in that
from Him is also <span id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436.md) the first
principle of the works, from whom is the existence of the Persons who
co-operate in working: for that both the Son is born of Him, and the
Holy Spirit proceedeth from Him, as the First Beginning, of whom the Son
is born, and with whom He hath one Spirit in common; and again that when
the Lord said, “If I had not done among them the works which none other
did,” <span id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437.md) He did not speak in
reference to the Father and the Spirit, as that They did not co-operate
with Him in those works; but to men by whom we read of many miracles
having been done, but by none such miracles as the Son did. And what the
Apostle says of the Holy Spirit, “But all these worketh that one and the
self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will,” is not
said, because the Father and the Son do not co-operate with Him; but
because in these works there are not many spirits, but One Spirit, and
in His divers operations He is not diverse from Himself.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p134"></span>27. <span
id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438.md) And yet it is not without cause,
but with reason and with truth said, that the Father, and not the Son
and the Holy Spirit, said, “Thou art My beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased.” <span id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439.md) Nevertheless, we do
not deny that the Son and the Holy Spirit co-operated in working this
miracle of the voice sounding from heaven, though we know that it
belongs to the Person of the Father only. For though the Son bearing
flesh, was there conversing with men on earth, He was not the less on
that account in the Bosom of the Father also as the Only-Begotten Word,
when that Voice came out of the cloud; nor could it be either wisely and
through the Spirit  <span id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440.md) believed,
that God the Father separated the operation of these audible and passing
words from the co-operation of His Wisdom and His Spirit. In the same
way when we say most rightly, that not the Father, nor the Holy Spirit,
but the Son walked upon the sea, who only had that flesh and those feet
which rested on the waves; <span id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441.md)
yet who would deny that the Father and the Holy Spirit co-operated in
the work of so <span id="page_328">p. 328</span> <span
id="vii.xxiii-Page_328"></span>great a miracle? For so again we say most
truly that the Son only took this our flesh, not the Father, nor the
Holy Spirit, and yet he hath no true wisdom who denies that the Father,
or the Holy Spirit co-operated in the work of His Incarnation which
belongeth only to the Son. So also we say that neither the Father, nor
the Son, but the Holy Spirit only appeared both in the “form of a
dove,” <span id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md) and in “tongues as it
were of fire;” <span id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443.md) and gave to
those to whom He came the power to tell in many and various tongues “the
wonderful works of God;” and yet from this miracle which regards the
Holy Spirit only, we cannot separate the co-operation of the Father and
the Only-Begotten Word. So also the Whole Trinity work the works of each
several Person in the Trinity, the Two co-operating in the work of the
Other, through a perfect harmony of operation in the Three, and not
through any deficiency of the power to work effectually in One. And
since this is so, hence it is that the Lord Jesus cast out devils in the
Holy Spirit. Not that He was not able to accomplish this alone, or that
He assumed that aid as being insufficient for this work; but it was meet
that the spirit who is divided against himself should be driven out by
that Spirit, which the Father and the Son who are not divided in
themselves have in common.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p141"></span>28. And thus sins, because they are not
forgiven out of the Church, must be forgiven by that Spirit, by whom the
Church is gathered together into one. In fact, if any one out of the
Church repent him of his sins, and for this so great sin whereby he is
an alien from the Church of God, has an heart impenitent, what doth that
other repentance profit him? seeing by this alone he speaketh a word
against the Holy Ghost, whereby he is alienated from the Church, which
hath received this gift, that in her remission of sins should be given
in the Holy Ghost? Which remission though it be the work of the Whole
Trinity, is yet understood specially to belong to the Holy Spirit. For
He is the Spirit of the adoption of sons, “in whom we cry Abba,
Father;” <span id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444.md) that we may be able
to say to Him, “Forgive us our debts.” <span
id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445.md) And, “Hereby we know” as the
Apostle John says, “that Christ dwelleth in us, by His Spirit which He
hath given us.” <span id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446.md) “The Spirit
Itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of
God.” <span id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md) For to Him appertains
the fellowship, by which we are made the one body of the One only Son of
God. Whence it is written, “If there be therefore any consolation in
Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit.” <span
id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) With a view to this fellowship they
to whom He first came spake with the tongues of all nations. Because as
by tongues the fellowship of mankind is more closely united; so it
behoved that this fellowship of the sons of God and members of Christ
which was to be among all nations should be signified by the tongues of
all nations; that as at that time he was known to have received the Holy
Ghost, who spake with the tongues of all nations; so now he should
acknowledge that he has received the Holy Ghost, who is held by the bond
of the peace of the Church, which is spread throughout all nations.
Whence the Apostle says, “Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit
in the bond of peace.” <span id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md)

<span id="vii.xxiii-p148"></span>29. Now that He is the Spirit of the
Father, the Son Himself saith, “He proceedeth from the Father.” <span
id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) And in another place, “For it is
not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in
you.” <span id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451.md) And that He is the
Spirit of the Son also the Apostle saith, “God hath sent the Spirit of
His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father;” <span
id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452.md) that is, making you cry. For it is
we that cry; but in Him, that is, by His shedding abroad love in our
hearts, without which whoso crieth, crieth in vain. Whence he says
again, “If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of
His.” <span id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453.md) To which Person then in
the Trinity could the communion of this fellowship peculiarly appertain,
but to that Spirit which is common to the Father and the Son?

<span id="vii.xxiii-p153"></span>30. That they who have separated from
the Church have not this Spirit, the Apostle Jude has declared most
plainly, saying, “Who separate themselves, natural, having not the
Spirit.” <span id="fr_2454"></span>[2455](#fn_2454.md) Whence the Apostle
Paul reproving those even in the Church itself, who by the names of men,
though having a place in her unity, were raising a kind of schism, says
amongst other things, “But the natural man perceiveth not the things of
the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he
know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” <span
id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455.md) This shows his meaning, “doth not
perceive,” that is doth not receive the word of knowledge. These as
having a place in the Church, he speaks of as babes, not yet spiritual,
but still carnal, and such as are to be fed with milk, not with meat.
“Even,” he says, “as unto babes in Christ, have I given you milk and not
meat; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye
able.” <span id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456.md) When we say, “not
yet,” we must not despair, if that which is “not yet” tends to be. For
he says, “ye are yet carnal.” And showing how it is that they are
carnal, he says, “For whereas there is among you envying, and strife,
and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?” And again more
plainly, “For while one saith, I <span id="page_329">p. 329</span> <span
id="vii.xxiii-Page_329"></span>am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos,
are ye not carnal? Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers
by whom ye believed?” <span id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md) These
then, that is, Paul and Apollos, agreed together in the unity of the
Spirit and the bond of peace; and yet because the Corinthians began to
divide them among themselves, and “to be puffed up for one against
another,” they are said to be men—carnal and natural men, not able to
receive the things of the Spirit of God; and yet because they are not
separated from the Church, they are called “babes in Christ;” for indeed
he desired that they should be either Angels, or even Gods, whom he
reproved because they were men, that is, in those contentions, “They
savoured not the things which be of God, but the things which be of
men.” <span id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) But of those who are
separated from the Church it is not merely said, “perceiving not the
things of the Spirit of God,” lest it should be referred to the
perception of knowledge; but it is said, “Having not the Spirit.” For it
does not follow, that he who hath it, should also by knowledge perceive
what he hath.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p159"></span>31. The “babes” then “in Christ” who
have yet place in the Church, who are still natural and carnal, and
cannot “perceive,” that is, understand and know what they have, have
this Spirit. For how could they be babes in Christ except they were born
anew of the Holy Spirit? Nor ought it to seem any wonder that one may
have something, and yet not know what he hath. For to say nothing of the
Divinity of the Almighty, and the Unity of the Unchangeable Trinity, who
can easily perceive by knowledge what the soul is; and yet who is there
that hath not a soul? Finally, that we may know most certainly that
“babes in Christ,” who do not “perceive the things of the Spirit of
God,” have notwithstanding the Spirit of God; let us look how the
Apostle Paul, when a little while after he is rebuking them, saith,
“Know ye not that ye are the temples of God, and the Spirit of God
dwelleth in you?” <span id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md) This surely
he would in no wise say to those who are separated from the Church, who
are described as “having not the Spirit.”

<span id="vii.xxiii-p161"></span>32. But neither can he be said to be in
the Church, and to belong to that fellowship of the Spirit, who is mixed
up with Christ’s sheep by a bodily intercourse only in deceitfulness of
heart. For the “Holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit.” <span
id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460.md) Wherefore whosoever are baptized in
the congregations or separations rather <span
id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461.md) of schismatics or heretics,
although they have not been born again of the Spirit, like as it were to
Ishmael, who was Abraham’s son after the flesh; not like Isaac, who was
his son after the Spirit, <span id="fr_2462"></span>[2463](#fn_2462.md)
because by promise; yet when they come to the Catholic Church, and are
joined to the fellowship of the Spirit which without the Church they
beyond doubt had not, the washing of the flesh is not repeated in their
case. For “this form of godliness” was not wanting to them even when
they were without; but there is added to them “the Unity of the Spirit
in the bond of peace,” which cannot be given but within. Before they
were Catholics indeed, they were as they of whom the Apostle says,
“Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.” <span
id="fr_2463"></span>[2464](#fn_2463.md) For the visible form of the branch
may exist even when separated from the vine; but the invisible life of
the root cannot be had, but in the vine. Wherefore the bodily
sacraments, which even they who are separated from the Unity of Christ’s
Body bear and celebrate, may give “the form of godliness;” but the
invisible and spiritual power of godliness cannot in any wise be in
them, just as sensation does not accompany a man’s limb, when it is
amputated from the body.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p166"></span>33. And since this is so, remission of
sins, seeing it is not given but by the Holy Spirit, can only be given
in that Church which hath the Holy Spirit. For this is the effect of the
remission of sins, that the prince of sin, the spirit who is divided
against himself, should no more reign in us, and that being delivered
from the power of the unclean spirit, we should thenceforward be made
the temple of the Holy Spirit, and receive Him, by whom we are cleansed
through receiving pardon, to dwell in us, to work, increase, and perfect
righteousness. For at His first coming, when they who had received Him
spake with the tongues of all nations, and the Apostle Peter addressed
those who were present in amazement, they were pricked in heart, and
said to Peter and to the rest of the Apostles, “Men and brethren, what
shall we do?” show us. “And Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized
every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” <span
id="fr_2464"></span>[2465](#fn_2464.md) In the Church truly in which was
the Holy Ghost, were both brought to pass, that is, both the remission
of sins, and the receiving of this gift. And therefore was it “In the
Name of Jesus Christ;” because when He promised the same Holy Ghost; He
said, “Whom the Father will send in My Name.” <span
id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465.md) For the Spirit dwelleth in no man
without the Father and the Son; as neither doth the Son without the
Father and the Holy Spirit, nor the Father without them. Their
indwelling is inseparable, as their operation is inseparable; but
sometimes they manifest them<span id="page_330">p. 330</span> <span
id="vii.xxiii-Page_330"></span>selves separately by symbols <span
id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466.md) borrowed from the creatures, not in
their own substance; just as they are pronounced separately by the voice
in syllables which occupy separately their own spaces, and yet they are
not separated from each other by any intervals, or moments of time. For
they never can be pronounced together, whereas they can never exist,
except together. But as I have already said, and not once only, the
remission of sins, whereby the kingdom of the spirit which is divided
against himself is overthrown and driven out, and the fellowship of the
unity of the Church of God, out of which this remission of sins is not,
are regarded as the peculiar work of the Holy Spirit, with the
cooperation doubtless of the Father and the Son, because the Holy Spirit
is Himself in some sort the fellowship of the Father and the Son. For
the Father is not possessed <span id="fr_2467"></span>[2468](#fn_2467.md)
as Father by the Son and the Holy Spirit in common; because He is not
the Father of Both. And the Son is not possessed as Son by the Father
and the Holy Spirit in common; because He is not the Son of Both. But
the Holy Spirit is possessed as the Spirit by the Father and the Son in
common, because He is the One Spirit of Both.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p171"></span>34. Whosoever therefore shall be guilty
of impenitence against the Spirit, in whom the unity and fellowship of
the communion of the Church is gathered together, shall never have
forgiveness; because he has stopped the source of forgiveness against
himself, and deservedly shall he be condemned with the spirit, which is
divided against himself, who is himself also divided against the Holy
Spirit which is not divided against Himself. And of this the very
testimonies of the Gospel warn us, would we with good attention search
them. For according to Luke the Lord does not say, “That he who
blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven:” in that place
where He is answering those who said that He cast out devils by the
prince of the devils. Whence it would seem that this was not said once
only by the Lord; but we must not carelessly pass over the consideration
of the occasion on which this last also was spoken. For He was speaking
of those who should have confessed or denied Him before men, when He
said, “Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess Me before men, him
shall the Son of Man also confess before the Angels of God. But he that
denieth Me before men, shall be denied before the angels of God.” <span
id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468.md) And lest from this the salvation of
the Apostle Peter should be despaired of, he immediately subjoined, “And
whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be
forgiven him; but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost, it
shall not be forgiven; <span id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469.md)
blasphemeth,” that is, with that blasphemy of an impenitent heart, by
which resistance is made to remission of sins which is granted in the
Church by the Holy Ghost. And this blasphemy Peter had not, who
presently repented, when “he wept bitterly,” <span
id="fr_2470"></span>[2471](#fn_2470.md) and who after he had overcome the
spirit who is divided against himself, and who had desired to “have him
to harass him,” <span id="fr_2471"></span>[2472](#fn_2471.md) and against
whom the “Lord prayed for him that his faith might not fail,” even
received the Very Holy Spirit whom he resisted not, that not only his
sin might be forgiven him, but that through him remission of sins might
be preached and dispensed.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p176"></span>35. And in the narrative of the two
other Evangelists, the occasion of speaking out this sentence of the
blasphemy of the Spirit arose from the mention of the unclean spirit,
who is divided against himself. For it had been said of the Lord, that
“He cast out devils by the prince of the devils.” In that place the Lord
says, that “by the Holy Spirit He casteth out devils,” that so the
spirit who is not divided against Himself may overcome and cast out him
who is divided against himself; but that that man would abide in his
perdition, who refuses through impenitence to pass over into His peace,
who is not divided against Himself. For thus runs the narrative of Mark;
“Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men,
and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme; but he that shall
blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but shall be
held guilty of an eternal offence.” <span
id="fr_2472"></span>[2473](#fn_2472.md) When he had delivered these words
of the Lord, he then subjoined his own, saying, “Because they said He
hath an unclean spirit;” <span id="fr_2473"></span>[2474](#fn_2473.md) that
He might show that the cause of His saying this arose hence, because
they had said that “He cast out devils by Beelzebub the prince of the
devils.” Not that this was a blasphemy which shall not be forgiven,
forasmuch as even this shall be forgiven, if a right repentance follow
it; but because, as I have said, there arose hence a cause for that
sentence to be delivered by the Lord, since mention had been made of the
unclean spirit whom the Lord shows to be divided against himself,
because of the Holy Spirit who is not only not divided against Himself,
but who also makes those whom He gathers together undivided, by
forgiving those sins which are divided against themselves, and by
inhabiting those who are cleansed, that it may be with them, as it is
written in the Acts of the Apostles, “The multitude of them that
believed were of one heart and of one soul.” <span
id="fr_2474"></span>[2475](#fn_2474.md) And this gift of <span
id="page_331">p. 331</span> <span
id="vii.xxiii-Page_331"></span>forgiveness none resists, but he who has
the hardness of an impenitent heart. For in another place also the Jews
said of the Lord that He had a devil, <span
id="fr_2475"></span>[2476](#fn_2475.md) yet He spake nothing there of the
blasphemy of the Holy Spirit; because they did not so bring forward the
mention of the unclean spirit as that he could be shown out of their own
mouths to be divided against himself, as Beelzebub, by whom they said
that devils could be cast out.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p181"></span>36. But in this passage according to
Matthew, the Lord far more plainly explained what he intended to be
understood here; namely, that he it is who speaks a word against the
Holy Ghost, who with an impenitent heart resists the Unity of the
Church, where in the Holy Spirit is given the remission of sins. For
this spirit they have not, as has been said already, who even though
they bear and handle <span id="fr_2476"></span>[2477](#fn_2476.md) the
sacraments of Christ, are separated from His congregation. For when He
spoke of the division of Satan against Satan, and how that He Himself
cast out devils by the Holy Spirit, that Spirit, namely, which is not,
as the other, divided against Himself; lest any one should think because
of those who gather together their irregular assemblies <span
id="fr_2477"></span>[2478](#fn_2477.md) under the Name of Christ, but
without His fold, that the kingdom of Christ also was divided against
itself, He immediately added, “He that is not with Me is against Me, and
he that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad,” <span
id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478.md) that He might show that they did
not belong to Him who by gathering “without” wished not to “gather” but
“to scatter abroad.” And afterwards He subjoined, “Wherefore I say unto
you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the
blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven.” <span
id="fr_2479"></span>[2480](#fn_2479.md) What is this “wherefore?” Shall the
blasphemy of the Spirit only not be forgiven, because “he who is not
with Christ is against Him, and he who gathereth not with Him scattereth
abroad?” Even so, doubtless. For he that gathereth not with Him,
howsoever he may gather under His name, hath not the Holy Ghost.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p186"></span>37. Thus then hath He altogether forced
us to understand that the remission of no sin nor blasphemy can be
effected anywhere else, save in the gathering together of Christ, which
scattereth not abroad. For it is gathered together in the Holy Spirit,
which is not as that unclean spirit, divided against Himself. And
therefore all congregations, or dispersions rather, which call
themselves Churches of Christ, and are divided against themselves and
contrary one to the other, and hostile to the congregation of Unity,
which is His True Church, do not therefore belong to His congregation,
because they seem to have His Name. But they might belong to it, if the
Holy Spirit in whom this congregation is joined together, were divided
against Himself. But because this is not so (“for he that is not with
Christ is against Him, and he that gathereth not with Him scattereth
abroad”); therefore all manner of sin and all blasphemy shall be
forgiven unto men in this congregation, which Christ gathereth together
in the Holy Spirit, who is not divided against Himself. But that
blasphemy of the Spirit Himself, whereby in an impenitent heart
resistance is made to this so great gift of God even to the end of this
present life, shall not be forgiven. For though a man so oppose himself
to the truth, as to resist God speaking, not in the Prophets, but in His
Only Son (since for our sakes He was pleased that He should be the Son
of Man, that He might speak to us in Him), yet shall he be forgiven when
in repentance he shall have recourse to the goodness of God, who
forasmuch as He “willeth not the death of the wicked, but rather that he
should turn from his way and live,” <span
id="fr_2480"></span>[2481](#fn_2480.md) hath given the Holy Spirit to His
Church, that whosoever forgiveth sins in the Spirit, they should be
forgiven. But whoso stands out as an enemy to this gift, so as not in
repentance to seek it, but by impenitence to gainsay it, his sin becomes
unpardonable; not sin of any one specific kind, but the contempt, or
even opposing of the remission of sins itself. And so a word is spoken
against the Holy Spirit, when men never come from the dispersion to the
congregation which has received the Holy Spirit for the remission of
sins. Unto which congregation if any come without hypocrisy, though it
be through the ministry of a wicked clergyman, a reprobate and a
hypocrite, so he be a Catholic minister, he shall receive remission of
sins in this Holy Spirit. For such is the working of this Spirit in the
Holy Church, even in this present time, when the corn <span
id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481.md) is as it were being threshed with
the chaff, that he despises no man’s sincere confession, and is deceived
by no man’s false pretences, and so flies from the reprobate, as yet by
their ministry to gather together those that are approved. <span
id="fr_2482"></span>[2483](#fn_2482.md) One refuge then there is against
unpardonable blasphemy, that we take heed of an impenitent heart; and
that it be not thought that repentance can avail ought, unless the
Church be kept to, in which remission of sins is given, and the
fellowship of the Spirit is preserved in the bond of peace.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p190"></span>38. I have through the mercy and
assistance of the Lord handled, as I best was able, this most difficult
question, if indeed I have been able to do it in any measure.
Nevertheless, whatever I have not been able to apprehend in the
difficul<span id="page_332">p. 332</span> <span
id="vii.xxiii-Page_332"></span>ties of it, let it not be imputed to the
truth itself, which is a healthful exercise to the godly, even when it
is hidden, but to my infirmity, who either could not see what others
might have understood, or could not explain what I did understand. But
for that which perhaps I have been able to discover by force of
meditation, and to develop in words, to Him must the thanks be given,
from whom I have sought, from whom I have asked, unto whom I have
knocked, that I might have wherewithal to be nourished myself in
meditation, and to minister to you in speaking.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p19"></span> Maximianus, Deacon of the Church of
Carthage, of the faction of Donatus, took offence at Primianus Bishop of
Carthage, who had excommunicated him, and induced certain of the
Donatist bishops to call Primianus to account; and when he would not
acknowledge their authority, he was, as Cæcilianus had been, condemned
in his absence. Primianus was restored by others of the Donatist bishops
to communion, and Maximianus, together with twelve bishops who had
assisted at his ordination as bishop, was condemned (Augustin, *De Gest.
Emerit. Donat*. 9, etc., *Lib. ad. Bonif.*; Ep. 185<span
id="vii.xxiii-p19.1"></span> (al. 56) 17). The rest were restored to
communion on their submission. The Maximianists were afterwards
condemned by a Council of three hundred and ten bishops at the Council
of Vagaia, <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xxiii-p19.2"></span>A.D.</span> 394 (Ep. 108<span
id="vii.xxiii-p19.3"></span> (255) 6, and 141 (al. 152) 6). St. Augustin
frequently urges the separation of the Maximianists from the Donatists
as condemnatory on their own principles of their own schism against the
Catholic Church.
