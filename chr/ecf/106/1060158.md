<span id="vi.v.lxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXI.—Of the Little Child Whom He Set
Before Them for Their Imitation, and of the Offences of the World; Of
the Members of the Body Causing Offences; Of the Angels of the Little
Ones, Who Behold the Face of the Father; Of the One Sheep Out of the
Hundred Sheep; Of the Reproving of a Brother in Private; Of the Loosing
and the Binding of Sins; Of The Agreement of Two, and the Gathering
Together of Three; Of the Forgiving of Sins Even Unto Seventy Times
Seven; Of the Servant Who Had His Own Large Debt Remitted, and Yet
Refused to Remit the Small Debt Which His Fellow-Servant Owed to Him;
And of the Question as to Matthew’s Harmony with the Other Evangelists
on All These Subjects.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxii-p2"></span>119. The same Matthew then proceeds with
his narrative in the following terms: “In that hour came the disciples
unto Jesus, saying, Who, thinkest Thou, is the greater in the kingdom of
heaven? And Jesus called a little child unto Him, and set him in the
midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted,
and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of
heaven;” and so on, down to the words, “So likewise shall my heavenly
Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one
his brother their trespasses.” <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107) Of this somewhat lengthened
discourse which was spoken by the Lord, Mark, instead of giving the
whole, has presented only certain portions, in dealing with which he
follows meantime the same order. He has also introduced some matters
which Matthew does not mention. <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108) Moreover, in this complete
discourse, so far as we have taken it under consideration, the only
interruption is that which is made by Peter, when he inquires how often
a brother ought to be forgiven. The Lord, however, was speaking in a
strain which makes it quite clear that even the question which Peter
thus proposed, and the answer which was returned to him, belong really
to the same address. Luke, again, records none of these things in the
order here observed, with the exception of the incident with the little
child whom He set before His disciples, for their imitation when they
were thinking of their own greatness. <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109) For if he has also narrated some
other matters of a tenor resembling those which are inserted in this
discourse, these are sayings which he has recalled for notice in other
connections, and on occasions different from the present: just as
John <span id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110) introduces the Lord’s
words on the subject of the forgiveness of sins,—namely, those to the
effect that they should be remitted to him to whom the apostles remitted
them, and that they should be retained to him to whom they retained
them, as spoken by the Lord after His resurrection; while Matthew
mentions that in the discourse now under notice the Lord made this
declaration, which, however, the self-same evangelist at the same time
affirms to have been given on a previous occasion to Peter. <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111) Therefore, to preclude the
necessity of having always to inculcate the same rule, we ought to bear
in mind the fact that Jesus uttered the same word repeatedly, and in a
number of different places,—a principle which we have pressed so often
upon your attention already; and this consideration should save us from
feeling any perplexity, even although the order of the sayings may be
thought to create some difficulty.
