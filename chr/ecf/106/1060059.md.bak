<span id="vi.iii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="vi.iii-p3"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="vi.iii-p3.1"></span>In</span> the remarkable work known as his
*Retractations*, Augustin makes a brief statement on the subject of this
treatise on the *Harmony of the Evangelists.* The sixteenth chapter of
the second book of that memorable review of his literary career,
contains corrections of certain points on which he believed that he had
not been sufficiently accurate in these discussions. In the same passage
he informs us that this treatise was undertaken during the years in
which he was occupied with his great work on the *Trinity*, and that,
breaking in upon the task which had been making gradual progress under
his hand, he wrought continuously at this new venture until it was
finished. Its composition is assigned to about the year 400 <span
class="c13"><span id="vi.iii-p3.2"></span>A.D.</span> The date is
determined in the following manner: In the first book there is a
sentence (§ 27) which appears to indicate that, by the time when
Augustin engaged himself with this effort, the destruction of the idols
of the old religion was being carried out under express imperial
authority. No law of that kind, however, affecting Africa, seems to be
found expressed previous to those to which he refers at the close of the
eighteenth book of the *City of God*. There he gives us to understand
that such measures were put in force in Carthage, under Gaudentius and
Jovius, the associates of the Emperor Honorius, and states that for the
space of nearly thirty years from that time the Christian religion made
advances large enough to arrest general attention. Before that period,
which must have been about the year 399, the idols could not be
destroyed, as Augustin elsewhere indicates (*Serm*. lxii. 11, n. 17),
but with the consent of the parties to whom they belonged. These
considerations are taken to fix the composition of this work to a date
not earlier than the close of 399 <span class="c13"><span
id="vi.iii-p3.3"></span> A.D.</span>

<span id="vi.iii-p4"></span>Among Augustin’s numerous theological
productions, this one takes rank with the most toilsome and exhaustive.
We find him expressing himself to that effect now and again, when he has
occasion to allude to it. Thus, in the 112th *Tractate* on John (n. i),
he calls it a laborious piece of literature; and in the 117th *Tractate*
on the same evangelist, he speaks of the themes here dealt with as
matters which were discussed with the utmost painstaking.

<span id="vi.iii-p5"></span>Its great object is to vindicate the Gospel
against the critical assaults of the heathen. Paganism, having tried
persecution as its first weapon, and seen it fail, attempted next to
discredit the new faith by slandering its doctrine, impeaching its
history, and attacking with special persistency the veracity of the
Gospel writers. In this it was aided by some of Augustin’s heretical
antagonists, who endeavoured at times to establish a conspicuous
inconsistency between the Jewish Scriptures and the Christian, and at
times to prove the several sections of the New Testament to be at
variance with each other. Many alleged that the original Gospels had
received considerable additions of a spurious character. And it was a
favorite method of argumentation, adopted both by heathen and by
Manichæan adversaries, to urge that the evangelical historians
contradicted each other. Thus, in the present treatise (i. 7), Augustin
speaks of this matter of the discrepancies between the Evangelists as
the *palmary* argument wielded by his opponents. Hence, as elsewhere he
sought to demonstrate the congruity of the Old Testament with the New,
he set himself here to exonerate Christianity from the charge of any
defect of harmony, whether in the facts recorded or in the order of
their narration, between its four fundamental historical documents.

<span id="vi.iii-p6"></span>The plan of the work is laid out in four
great divisions. In the first book, he refutes those who asserted that
Christ was only the wisest among men, and who aimed at detracting from
the authority of the Gospels, by insisting on the absence of any written
compositions proceeding from the hand of Christ Himself, and by
affirming that the disciples went beyond what had been his own teaching
both on the subject of His divinity, and on the duty of abandoning the
worship of the gods. In the second, he enters upon a careful examination
of Matthew’s Gospel, on to the record of the supper, comparing it with
Mark, Luke, and John, and exhibiting the perfect harmony subsisting
between them. In the third, he demonstrates the same consistency between
the four Evangelists, from the account of the supper on to the end. And
in the fourth, he subjects to a similar investigation those passages in
Mark, Luke, and John, which have no proper parallels in Matthew.

<span id="vi.iii-p7"></span>For the discharge of a task like this,
Augustin was gifted with much, but he also lacked much. The resources of
a noble and penetrating intellect, profound spiritual insight, and
reverent love for Scripture, formed high qualifications at his command.
But he was deficient in exact scholarship. Thoroughly versed in Latin
litera<span id="page_72">p. 72</span> <span
id="vi.iii-Page_72"></span>ture, as is evinced here by the happy notices
of Ennius, Cicero, Lucan, and others of its great writers, he knew
little Greek, and no Hebrew. He refers more than once in the present
treatise to his ignorance of the original language of the Old Testament;
and while his knowledge of that of the New was probably not so
unserviceable as has often been supposed, instances like that in which
he solves the apparent difficulty in the two *burdens,* mentioned in
[Gal. vi](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.iii-p7.1"></span>., without alluding to the distinction between
the Greek words, make it sufficiently plain that it was not at least his
invariable habit to prosecute these studies with the original in his
view. Hence we find him missing many explanations which would at once
have suggested themselves, had he not so implicitly followed the
imperfect versions of the sacred text.

<span id="vi.iii-p8"></span>An analysis of the contents of the work
might show much that is of interest to the Biblical critic. Principles
elsewhere theoretically enunciated are seen here in their free
application. In some respects, this effort is one of a more severely
scientific character than is often the case with Augustin. It displays
much less digression than is customary with him. The tendency to
extravagant allegorizing is also less frequently indulged in, although
it does come to the surface at times, as in the notable example of the
interpretation of the names *Leah* and *Rachel*. His inordinate
dependence upon the Septuagint, however, is as broadly marked here as
anywhere. As he sometimes indicates an inclination to accept the story
of Aristeas, in this composition he almost goes the length of claiming a
special inspiration for these translators. On the other hand, in many
passages we have the privilege of seeing his resolve to be no uncritical
expositor. He pauses often to chronicle varieties of reading, sometimes
in the Latin text and sometimes in the Greek. Thus he notices the
occurrence of *Lebbæus* for *Thaddæus*, of *Dalmanutha* for *Magedan*,
and the like, and mentions how some codices read *woman* for *maid*, in
the sentence, *The maid is not dead, but sleepeth* ([Matt. ix.
24](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#024)<span id="vi.iii-p8.1"></span>.md).

<span id="vi.iii-p9"></span>His principles of harmonizing are ordinarily
characterized by simplicity and good sense. In general, he surmounts the
difficulty of what may seem at first sight discordant versions of one
incident, by supposing different instances of the same circumstances, or
repeated utterances of the same words. He holds emphatically by the
position, that wherever it is possible to believe two similar incidents
to have taken place, no contradiction can legitimately be alleged,
although no Evangelist may relate them both together. All merely verbal
variations in the records of the same occurrence he regards as matters
of too little consequence to create any serious perplexity to the
student whose aim is honestly to reach the sense intended. Such
narratives as those of the storm upon the lake, the healing of the
centurion’s servant, and the denials of Peter, furnish good examples of
his method, and of the fair and fearless spirit of his inquiry. And
however unsuccessful we may now judge some of his endeavours, when we
consider the comparative poverty of his materials, and the untrodden
field which he essayed to search, we shall not deny to this treatise the
merit of grandeur in original conception, and exemplary faithfulness in
actual execution.
