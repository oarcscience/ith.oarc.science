<span id="vi.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Concerning the Two Virtues, of Which
John is Conversant with the Contemplative, the Other Evangelists with
the Active.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v-p2"></span>8. Moreover, there are two several virtues
(or talents) which have been proposed to the mind of man. Of these, the
one is the active, and the other the contemplative: the one being that
whereby the way is taken, and the other that whereby the goal is
reached; <span id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md) the one that by which
men labour in order that the heart may be purified to see God, and the
other that by which men are disengaged <span
id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) and God is seen. Thus the former of
these two virtues is occupied with the precepts for the right exercise
of the temporal life, whereas the latter deals with the doctrine of that
life which is everlasting. In this way, also, the one operates, the
other rests; for the former finds its sphere in the purging of sins, the
latter moves in the light <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) of the
purged. And thus, again, in this mortal life the one is engaged with the
work of a good conversation; while the other subsists rather on faith,
and is seen only in the person of the very few, and through the glass
darkly, and only in part in a kind of vision of the unchangeable
truth. <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) Now these two virtues are
understood to be presented emblematically in the instance of the two
wives of Jacob. Of these I have discoursed already up to the measure of
my ability, and as fully as seemed to be appropriate to my task, (in
what I have written) in opposition to Faustus the Manichæan. <span
id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) For Lia, indeed, by interpretation
means “labouring,” <span id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md) whereas
Rachel signifies “the first principle seen.” <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md) And by this it is given us to
understand, if one will only attend carefully to the matter, that those
three evangelists who, with pre-eminent fulness, have handled the
account of the Lord’s temporal doings and those of His sayings which
were meant to bear chiefly upon the moulding of the manners of the
present life, were conversant with that active virtue; and that John, on
the other hand, who narrates fewer by far of the Lord’s doings, but
records with greater carefulness and with larger wealth of detail the
words which He spoke, and most especially those discourses which were
intended to introduce us to the knowledge of the unity of the Trinity
and the blessedness of the life eternal, formed his plan and framed his
statement with a view to commend the contemplative virtue to our regard.

passage referred to in the treatise against Faustus the Manichæan,
Augustin appends the explanation, *sive verbum ex quo videtur
principium*, = the first principle seen, or the word by which the first
principle is seen. The etymologies on which Augustin proceeds may
perhaps be these: for Leah, the Hebrew verb *Laah*, to be wearied (<span
class="Hebrew"><span id="vi.iv.v-p9.2"></span>לָאָה</span>); and for
Rachel the Hebrew forms *Raah* = see, and *Chalal* = begin (<span
