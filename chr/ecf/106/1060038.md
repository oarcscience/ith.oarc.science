<span id="v.iii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.</span>

<span id="v.iii.viii-p2"></span>28. The fifth petition follows: “And
forgive us our debts, as we also forgive <span
id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) our debtors.” It is manifest that by
debts are meant sins, either from that statement which the Lord Himself
makes, “Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the
uttermost farthing;” <span id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md) or from the
fact that He called those men debtors who were reported to Him as having
been killed, either those on whom the tower fell, or those whose blood
Herod had mingled with the sacrifice. For He said that men supposed it
was because they were debtors above measure, *i.e.* sinners, and added
“I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
die.” <span id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) Here, therefore, it is not
a money claim that one is pressed to remit, but whatever sins another
may have committed against him. <span id="page_43">p. 43</span> <span
id="v.iii.viii-Page_43"></span>For we are enjoined to remit a money
claim by that precept rather which has been given above, “If any man
will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak
also;” <span id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md) nor is it necessary to
remit a debt to every money debtor; but only to him who is unwilling to
pay, to such an extent that he wishes even to go to law. “Now the
servant of the Lord,” as says the apostle, “must not go to law.” <span
id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md) And therefore to him who shall be
unwilling, either spontaneously or when requested, to pay the money
which he owes, it is to be remitted. For his unwillingness to pay will
arise from one of two causes, either that he has it not, or that he is
avaricious and covetous of the property of another; and both of these
belong to a state of poverty: for the former is poverty of substance,
the latter poverty of disposition. Whoever, therefore, remits a debt to
such an one, remits it to one who is poor, and performs a Christian
work; while that rule remains in force, that he should be prepared in
mind to lose what is owing to him. For if he has used exertion in every
way, quietly and gently, to have it restored to him, not so much aiming
at a money profit, as that he may bring the man round to what is right,
to whom without doubt it is hurtful to have the means of paying, and yet
not to pay; not only will he not sin, but he will even do a very great
service, in trying to prevent that other, who is wishing to make gain of
another’s money, from making shipwreck of the faith; which is so much
more serious a thing, that there is no comparison. And hence it is
understood that in this fifth petition also, where we say, “Forgive us
our debts,” the words are spoken not indeed in reference to money, but
in reference to all ways in which any one sins against us, and by
consequence in reference to money also. For the man who refuses to pay
you the money which he owes, when he has the means of doing so, sins
against you. And if you do not forgive this sin, you will not be able to
say, “Forgive us, as we also forgive;” but if you pardon it, you see how
he who is enjoined to offer such a prayer is admonished also with
respect to forgiving a money debt.

<span id="v.iii.viii-p8"></span>29. That may indeed be construed in this
way, that when we say, “Forgive us our debts, as <span
id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) we also forgive,” then only are we
convicted of having acted contrary to this rule, if we do not forgive
them who ask pardon, because we also wish to be forgiven by our most
gracious Father when we ask His pardon. But, on the other hand, by that
precept whereby we are enjoined to pray for our enemies, it is not for
those who ask pardon that we are enjoined to pray. For those who are
already in such a state of mind are no longer enemies. By no
possibility, however, could one truthfully say that he prays for one
whom he has not pardoned. And therefore we must confess that all sins
which are committed against us are to be forgiven, if we wish those to
be forgiven by our Father which we commit against Him. For the subject
of revenge has been sufficiently discussed already, as I think. <span

between the spirit of Christianity and Islam as indicated by a
comparison of this petition with the prayer offered every night by the
ten thousand students at the Mahometan college in Cairo: “I seek refuge
with Allah from Satan the accursed. In the name of Allah the
compassionate, the merciful, O Lord of all the creatures! O Allah!
destroy the infidels and polytheists, thine enemies, the enemies of the
religion. O Allah! make their children orphans, and defile their abodes.
Cause their feet to slip,” etc.
