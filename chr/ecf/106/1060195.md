<span id="vi.vi.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Of the Derision Ascribed to the
Robbers, and of the Question Regarding the Absence of Any Discrepancy
Between Matthew and Mark on the One Hand, and Luke on the Other, When
the Last-Named Evangelist States that One of the Two Mocked Him, and
that the Other Believed on Him.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xvii-p2"></span>53. Matthew continues his narrative in
these terms: “The robbers also, which were crucified with Him, cast the
same in His teeth.” <span id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md) Mark is
quite in harmony with Matthew here, giving the same statement in
different words. <span id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md) On the other
hand, Luke may be thought to contradict this, unless we be careful not
to forget a certain mode of speech which is sufficiently familiar. For
Luke’s narrative runs thus: “And one of the malefactors which were
hanged railed on Him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and
us.” <span id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429.md) And then the same writer
proceeds to introduce into the same context the following recital: “But
the other answering, rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing
thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive
the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. And
he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy kingdom.
And Jesus said unto him, Verily, I say unto thee, To-day thou shalt be
with me in paradise.”  <span id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) The
question then is, how we can reconcile either Matthew’s report, “The
robbers also, which were crucified with Him, cast the same in His
teeth,” or Mark’s, namely, “And they that were crucified with Him
reviled Him,” with Luke’s testimony, which is to the effect that one of
them reviled Christ, but that the other arrested him and believed on the
Lord. The explanation will be, that Matthew and Mark, presenting a
concise version of the passage under review, have employed the plural
number instead of the singular; as is the case in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, where we find the statement given in the plural form, that
“they stopped the mouths of lions,” <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md) while Daniel alone is understood to
be referred to. Again, the plural number is adopted where it is said
that they “were sawn asunder,” <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) while that manner of death is
reported only of Isaiah. In the same way, when it is said in the Psalm,
“The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers took counsel
together,” etc., <span id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) the plural
number is employed instead of the singular, according to the exposition
given of the passage in the Acts of the Apostles. For those who have
made use of the testimony of the said Psalm in that book take the kings
to refer to Herod, and the princes to Pilate. <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md) But further, inasmuch as the pagans
are in the habit of bringing such slanderous charges against the Gospel,
I would ask them to consider how their own writers have spoken of
Phaedras and Medeas and Clytemnestras, when there really was but a
single individual reputed under each of these names. And what is more
common, for example, than for a person to say, “The rustics also behave
insolently to me,” even although it should only be one that acted
rudely? In short, no real discrepancy would be created by the
restriction of Luke’s report to one of the two robbers, unless the other
evangelists had declared expressly that “both” the malefactors reviled
the Lord; for in that case it would not be possible for us to suppose
only one individual intended under the plural number. Seeing, however,
that the phrase employed is “the robbers,” or “those who were crucified
with Him,” and the term “both” is not added, the expression is one which
might have been used if both these men had been engaged in the thing,
but which might equally well be adopted if one of the two had been
implicated in it,—that fact <span id="page_204">p. 204</span> <span
id="vi.vi.xvii-Page_204"></span>being then conveyed by the use of the
plural number, according to a familiar method of speech.
