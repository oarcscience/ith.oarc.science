<span id="vi.v.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Of the Reason Why Forty Generations
(Not Including Christ Himself) are Found in Matthew, Although He Divides
Them into Three Successions of Fourteen Each.</span>

<span id="vi.v.v-p2"></span>8. The matter next to be introduced,
moreover, is one requiring, in order to its right apprehension and
contemplation, a reader of the greatest attention and carefulness. For
it has been acutely observed that Matthew, who had proposed to himself
the task of commending the kingly character in Christ, named, exclusive
of Christ Himself, forty men in the series of generations. Now this
number denotes the period in which, in this age and on this earth, it
behoves us to be ruled by Christ in accordance with that painful
discipline whereby “God scourgeth,” as it is written, “every son that He
receiveth;” <span id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) and of which also an
apostle says that “we must through much tribulation enter into the
kingdom of God.” <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) This discipline
is also signified by that rod of iron, concerning which we read this
statement in a Psalm: “Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron;” <span
id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) which words occur after the saying,
“Yet I am set king by Him upon His holy hill of Zion!” <span
id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) For the good, too, are ruled with a
rod of iron, as it is said of them: “The time is come that judgment
should begin at the house of God; and if it first begin at us, what
shall the end be to them that obey not the gospel of God? and if the
righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner
appear?” <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) To the same persons the
sentence that follows also applies: “Thou shall dash them in pieces like
a potter’s vessel.” For the good, indeed, are ruled by this discipline,
while the wicked are crushed by it. And these two different classes of
persons are mentioned here as if they were the same, on account of the
identity of the signs <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) employed
in reference to the wicked in common with the good.

<span id="vi.v.v-p9"></span>9. That this number, then, is a sign of that
laborious period in which, under the discipline of Christ the King, we
have to fight against the devil, is also indicated by the fact that both
the law and the prophets solemnized a fast of forty days,—that is to
say, a humbling of the soul,—in the person of Moses and Elias, who
fasted each for a space of forty days. <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) And what else does the Gospel
narrative shadow forth under the fast of the Lord Himself, during which
forty days He was also tempted of the devil, <span
id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) than that condition of temptation
which appertains to us through all the space of this age, and which He
bore in the flesh which He condescended to take to Himself from our
mortality? After the resurrection also, it was His will to remain with
His disciples on the earth not longer than forty days, <span
id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) continuing to mingle for that space of
time with this life of theirs in the way of human intercourse, and
partaking along with them of the food needful for mortal men, although
He Himself was to die no more; and all this was done with the view of
signifying to them through these forty days, that although His presence
should be hidden from their eyes, He would yet fulfil what He promised
when He said, “Lo, I am with you, even to the end of the world.”  <span
id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) And in explanation of the circumstance
that this particular number should denote this temporal and earthly
life, what suggests itself most immediately in the meantime, although
there may be another and subtler method of accounting for it, is the
consideration that the seasons of the years also revolve in four
successive alternations, and that the world itself has its bounds
determined by four divisions, which Scripture sometimes designates by
the names of the winds,—East and West, Aquilo \[or North\] and Meridian
\[or South\]. <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) But the number
forty is equivalent to four times ten. Furthermore, the number ten
itself is made up by adding the several numbers in succession from one
up to four together.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span> <span id="vi.v.v-Page_106"></span>

<span id="vi.v.v-p15"></span>10. In this way, then, as Matthew undertook
the task of presenting the record of Christ as the King who came into
this world, and into this earthly and mortal life of men, for the
purpose of exercising rule over us who have to struggle with temptation,
he began with Abraham, and enumerated forty men. For Christ came in the
flesh from that very nation of the Hebrews with a view to the keeping of
which as a people distinct from the other nations, God separated Abraham
from his own country and his own kindred. <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) And the circumstance that the promise
contained an intimation of the race from which He was destined to come,
served very specially to make the prediction and announcement concerning
Him something all the clearer. Thus the evangelist did indeed mark out
fourteen generations in each of three several members, stating that from
Abraham until David there were fourteen generations, and from David
until the carrying away into Babylon other fourteen generations, and
another fourteen from that period on to the nativity of Christ. <span
id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) But he did not then reckon them all up
in one sum, counting them one by one, and saying that thus they make up
forty-two in all. For among these progenitors there is one who is
enumerated twice, namely Jechonias, with whom a kind of deflection was
made in the direction of extraneous nations at the time when the
transmigration into Babylon took place. <span
id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) When the enumeration, moreover, is
thus bent from the direct order of progression, and is made to form, if
we may so say, a kind of corner for the purpose of taking a different
course, what meets us at that corner is mentioned twice over,—namely, at
the close of the preceding series, and at the head of the deflection
specified. And this, too, was a figure of Christ as the one who was, in
a certain sense, to pass from the circumcision to the uncircumcision,
or, so to speak, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and to be, as it were, the
corner-stone to all who believe on Him, whether on the one side or on
the other. Thus was God making preparations then in a figurative manner
for things which were to come in truth. For Jechonias himself, with
whose name the kind of corner which I have in view was prefigured, is by
interpretation the “preparation of God.” <span
id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) In this way, therefore, there are
really not forty-two distinct generations named here, which would be the
proper sum of three times fourteen; but, as there is a double
enumeration of one of the names, we have here forty generations in all,
taking into account the fact that Christ Himself is reckoned in the
number, who, like the kingly president over this \[significant\] number
forty, superintends the administration of this temporal and earthly life
of ours.

<span id="vi.v.v-p20"></span>11. And inasmuch as it was Matthew’s
intention to set forth Christ as descending with the object of sharing
this mortal state with us, he has mentioned those same generations from
Abraham on to Joseph, and on to the birth of Christ Himself, in the form
of a descending scale, and at the very beginning of his Gospel. Luke, on
the other hand, details those generations not at the commencement of his
Gospel, but at the point of Christ’s baptism, and gives them not in the
descending, but in the ascending order, ascribing to Him preferentially
the character of a priest in the expiation of sins, as where the voice
from heaven declared Him, and where John himself delivered his testimony
in these terms: “Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the
world!” <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) Besides, in the process
by which he traces the genealogy upwards, he passes Abraham and carries
us back to God, to whom, purified and atoned for, we are reconciled. Of
merit, too, He has sustained in Himself the origination of our adoption;
for we are made the sons of God through adoption, by believing on the
Son of God. Moreover, on our account the Son of God was pleased to be
made the son of man by the generation which is proper to the flesh. And
the evangelist has shown clearly enough that he did not name Joseph the
son of Heli on the ground that he was begotten of him, but only on the
ground that he was adopted by him. For he has spoken of Adam also as the
son of God, who, strictly speaking, was made by God, but was also, as it
may be said, constituted a son in paradise by the grace which afterwards
he lost through his transgression.

<span id="vi.v.v-p22"></span>12. In this way, it is the taking of our
sins upon Himself by the Lord Christ that is signified in the genealogy
of Matthew, while in the genealogy of Luke it is the abolition of our
sins by the Lord Christ that is expressed. In accordance with these
ideas, the one details the names in the descending scale, and the other
in the ascending. For when the apostle says, “God sent His Son in the
likeness of the flesh of sin,” <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md)
he refers to the taking of our sins upon Himself by Christ. But when he
adds, “for sin, to condemn sin in the flesh,” <span
id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) he expresses the expiation of sins.
Consequently Matthew traces the succession downwards from David through
Solomon, in connection with whose mother it was that he sinned; while
Luke carries the gene<span id="page_107">p. 107</span> <span
id="vi.v.v-Page_107"></span>alogy upwards to the same David through
Nathan, <span id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md) by which prophet God
took away <span id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md) his sin. <span
id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md) The number, also, which Luke follows
does most certainly best indicate the taking away of sins. For inasmuch
as in Christ, who Himself had no sin, there is assuredly no iniquity
allied to the iniquities of men which He bore in His flesh, the number
adopted by Matthew makes forty when Christ is excepted. On the contrary,
inasmuch as, by clearing us of all sin and purging us, He places us in a
right relation to His own and His Father’s righteousness (so that the
apostle’s word is made good: “But he that is joined to the Lord is one
spirit” <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704) .md), in the number used by
Luke we find included both Christ Himself, with whom the enumeration
begins, and God, with whom it closes; and the sum becomes thus
seventy-seven, which denotes the thorough remission and abolition of all
sins. This perfect removal of sins the Lord Himself also clearly
represented under the mystery of this number, when He said that the
person sinning ought to be forgiven not only seven times, but even unto
seventy times seven.  <span id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md)

<span id="vi.v.v-p30"></span>13. A careful inquiry will make it plain
that it is not without some reason that this latter number is made to
refer to the purging of all sins. For the number ten is shown to be, as
one may say, the number of justice \[righteousness\] in the instance of
the ten precepts of the law. Moreover, sin is the transgression of the
law. And the transgression <span id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md) of
the number ten is expressed suitably in the eleven; whence also we find
instructions to have been given to the effect that there should be
eleven curtains of haircloth constructed in the tabernacle; <span
id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md) for who can doubt that the haircloth
has a bearing upon the expression of sin? Thus, too, inasmuch as all
time in its revolution runs in spaces of days designated by the number
seven, we find that when the number eleven is multiplied by the number
seven, we are brought with all due propriety to the number seventy-seven
as the sign of sin in its totality. In this enumeration, therefore, we
come upon the symbol for the full remission of sins, as expiation is
made for us by the flesh of our Priest, with whose name the calculation
of this number starts here; and as reconciliation is also effected for
us with God, with whose name the reckoning of this number is here
brought to its conclusion by the Holy Spirit, who appeared in the form
of a dove on the occasion of that baptism in connection with which the
number in question is mentioned. <span id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md)
