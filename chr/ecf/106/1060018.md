<span id="v.ii.xii"></span>

<span id="v.ii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.</span>

<span id="v.ii.xii-p2"></span>33. “Ye have heard that it was said to
them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you,
that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed
adultery with her already in his heart.” The lesser righteousness,
therefore, is not to commit adultery by carnal connection; but the
greater righteousness of the kingdom of God is not to commit adultery in
the heart. Now, the man who does not commit adultery in the heart, much
more easily guards against committing adultery in actual fact. Hence He
who gave the later precept confirmed the earlier; for He came not to
destroy the law, but to fulfil it. It is well worthy of consideration
that He did not say, Whosoever lusteth after a woman, but,” Whosoever
looketh on a woman to lust after her,” <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108) *i.e.* turneth toward her with this
aim and this intent, that he may lust after her; which, in fact, is not
merely to be tickled <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109) by fleshly
delight, but fully to consent to lust; so that the forbidden appetite is
not restrained, but satisfied if opportunity should be given.

<span id="v.ii.xii-p5"></span>34. For there are three things which go to
complete sin: the suggestion of, the taking pleasure in, and the
consenting to. Suggestion takes place either by means of memory, or by
means of the bodily senses, when we see, or hear, or smell, or taste, or
touch anything. And if it give us pleasure to enjoy this, this pleasure,
if illicit, must be restrained. Just as when we are fasting, and on
seeing food the appetite of the palate is stirred up, this does not
happen without pleasure; but we do not consent to this liking, and <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110) we repress it by the right of reason,
which has the supremacy. But if consent shall take place, the sin will
be complete, known to God in our heart, although it may not become known
to men by deed. There are, then, these steps: the suggestion is made, as
it were, by a serpent, that is to say, by a fleeting and rapid, *i.e.* a
temporary, movement of bodies: for if there are also any such images
moving about in the soul, they have been derived from without from the
body; and if any hidden sensation of the body besides those five senses
touches the soul, that also is temporary and fleeting; and therefore the
more clandestinely it glides in, so as to affect the process of
thinking, the more aptly is it compared to a serpent. Hence these three
stages, as I was beginning to say, resemble that transaction which is
described in Genesis, so that the suggestion and a certain measure of
suasion is put forth, as it were, by the serpent; but the taking
pleasure in it lies in the carnal appetite, as it were in Eve; and the
consent lies in the reason, as it were in the man: and these things
having been acted through, the man is driven forth, as it were, from
paradise, *i.e.* from the most blessed light of righteousness, into
death <span id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111) —in all respects most
righteously. For he who puts forth suasion does not compel. And all
natures are beautiful in their order, according to their gradations; but
we must not descend from the higher, among which the rational mind has
its place assigned, to the lower. Nor is any one compelled to do this;
and therefore, if he does it, he is punished by the just law of God, for
he is not guilty of this unwillingly. But yet, previous to habit, either
there is no pleasure, or it is so slight that there is hardly any; and
to yield to it is a great sin, as such pleasure is unlawful. Now, when
any one does yield, he commits sin in the heart. If, however, he also
proceeds to action, the desire seems to be satis<span id="page_16">p.
16</span> <span id="v.ii.xii-Page_16"></span>fied and extinguished; but
afterwards, when the suggestion is repeated, a greater pleasure is
kindled, which, however, is as yet much less than that which by
continuous practice is converted into habit. For it is very difficult to
overcome this; and yet even habit itself, if one does not prove untrue
to himself, and does not shrink back in dread from the Christian
warfare, he will get the better of under His (*i.e.* Christ’s)
leadership and assistance; and thus, in accordance with primitive peace
and order, both the man is subject to Christ, and the woman is subject
to the man. <span id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112)

<span id="v.ii.xii-p9"></span>35. Hence, just as we arrive at sin by
three steps,—suggestion, pleasure, consent,—so of sin itself there are
three varieties,—in heart, in deed, in habit,—as it were, three deaths:
one, as it were, in the house, *i.e.* when we consent to lust in the
heart; a second now, as it were, brought forth outside the gate, when
assent goes forward into action; a third, when the mind is pressed down
by the force of bad habit, as if by a mound of earth, and is now, as it
were, rotting in the sepulchre. And whoever reads the Gospel perceives
that our Lord raised to life these three varieties of the dead. And
perhaps he reflects what differences may be found in the very word of
Him who raises them, when He says on one occasion, “Damsel,
arise;” <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113) on another, “Young
man, <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114) I say unto thee,
Arise;” <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115) and when on another
occasion He groaned in the spirit, and wept, and again groaned, and then
afterwards “cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.” <span
id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116)

<span id="v.ii.xii-p14"></span>36. And therefore, under the category of
the adultery mentioned in this section, we must understand all fleshly
and sensual lust. For when Scripture so constantly speaks of idolatry as
fornication, and the Apostle Paul calls avarice by the name of
idolatry, <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117) who doubts but that
every evil lust is rightly called fornication, since the soul,
neglecting the higher law by which it is ruled, and prostituting itself
for the base pleasure of the lower nature as its reward (so to speak),
is thereby corrupted? And therefore let every one who feels carnal
pleasure rebelling against right inclination in his own case through the
habit of sinning, by whose unsubdued violence he is dragged into
captivity, recall to mind as much as he can what kind of peace he has
lost by sinning, and let him cry out, “O wretched man that I am! who
shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus
Christ.” <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118) For in this way, when
he cries out that he is wretched, in the act of bewailing he implores
the help of a comforter. Nor is it a small approach to blessedness, when
he has come to know his wretchedness; and therefore “blessed” also “are
they that mourn, <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119) for they shall
be comforted.”
