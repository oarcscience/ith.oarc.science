<p class="c39"><a name="vi.vi.xii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="vi.vi.xii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XI.&#8212;Of the Consistency of Matthew&#146;s Version with that of Mark in the Account of the Potion Offered Him to Drink, Which is Introduced Before the Narrative of His Crucifixion.</span></p>  			 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.vi.xii-p2"></A>38. Matthew then proceeds in these terms: &#8220;And they came unto a place called Golgotha; that is to say, a place of a skull.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1376"></A><A HREF="#fn_1376"><FONT SIZE="1">1377</FONT></A>
 So far as the place is concerned, they are most unmistakeably at one. The same Matthew next adds, &#8220;and they gave Him wine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1377"></A><A HREF="#fn_1377"><FONT SIZE="1">1378</FONT></A>
 to drink, mingled with gall; and when He had tasted thereof, He would not drink.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1378"></A><A HREF="#fn_1378"><FONT SIZE="1">1379</FONT></A>
 This is given by Mark as follows: &#8220;And they gave Him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; and He received it not.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1379"></A><A HREF="#fn_1379"><FONT SIZE="1">1380</FONT></A>
 Here we may understand Matthew to have conveyed the same sense as Mark, when he speaks of the wine being &#8220;mingled with gall.&#8221; For the gall is mentioned with a view to express the bitterness of the potion. And wine mingled with myrrh is remarkable for its bitterness. The fact may also be that gall and myrrh together made the wine exceedingly bitter. Again, when Mark says that &#8220;He received it not,&#8221; we understand the phrase to denote that He did not receive it so as 				actually to drink it. He did taste <A NAME="page_197"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 197</FONT></A> <a name="vi.vi.xii-Page_197"></A>it, however, as Matthew certifies. Thus Mark&#146;s words, &#8220;He received it not,&#8221; convey the same meaning as Matthew&#146;s version, &#8220;He would not drink.&#8221; The former, however, has said nothing about His tasting the potion.</p>
