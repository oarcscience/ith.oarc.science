and 31, “We must work the works of him that sent me,” etc. Against the
Arians. And of that which the man who was born blind and received his
sight said, “We know that God heareth not sinners.”*

<span id="vii.lxxxvii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.lxxxvii-p4.1"></span>The</span> Lord Jesus, as we heard when the
Holy Gospel was being read, opened the eyes of a man who was born blind.
Brethren, if we consider our hereditary punishment, the whole world is
blind. And therefore came Christ the Enlightener, because the devil had
been the Blinder. He made all men to be born blind, who seduced the
first man. Let them run to the Enlightener, let them run, believe,
receive the clay made of the spittle. The Word is as it were the
spittle, the Flesh is the earth. Let them wash the face in the pool of
Siloa. Now it was the Evangelist’s place to explain to us what Siloa
means, and he said, “which is by interpretation, Sent.” <span
id="fr_4018"></span>[4019](#fn_4018.md) Who is This That is Sent, but He
who in this very Lesson said, “I am come to do the works of Him That
sent Me.” <span id="fr_4019"></span>[4020](#fn_4019.md) Lo, Siloa, wash the
face, be baptized, that ye may be enlightened, and that ye who before
saw not, may see.

<span id="vii.lxxxvii-p7"></span>2. Lo, first open your eyes to that
which is said; “I am come,” saith He, “to do the works of Him That sent
Me.” Now here at once stands forth the Arian, and says, “Here you see
that Christ did not His Own works, but the Father’s who sent Him.” Would
he say this, if he saw, that is, if he had washed his face in Him who
was sent, as it were in Siloa? What then dost thou say? “Lo,” says he,
“Himself said it.” What said He? “I am come to do the works of Him That
sent Me.” Are they not then His Own? No. What then is that which the
Siloa Himself saith, the Sent Himself, the Son Himself, the Only Son
Himself, whom thou complainest of as degenerate? What is that He saith,
“All things that the Father hath are Mine.” <span
id="fr_4020"></span>[4021](#fn_4020.md) You say that He did the works of
Another, in that He said, “I must do the works of Him That sent Me.” I
say that the Father had the things of another: I am speaking according
to your <span id="fr_4021"></span>[4022](#fn_4021.md) principles. Why would
you object to me that Christ said, “I am come to do His works” as if,
“not Mine own but ‘His That sent Me’”?

<span id="vii.lxxxvii-p10"></span>3. I ask Thee, O Lord Christ, resolve
the difficulty, put an end to the contention. “All things,” saith He,
“that the Father hath are Mine.” Are they then not the Father’s, if they
are Thine? For He doth not say, “All things that the Father hath He hath
given unto Me;” although, if He had said even this, He would have shown
His equality. But the difficulty is that He said, “All things that the
Father hath are Mine.” If you understand it aright, All things that the
Father hath, are the Son’s; all things that the Son hath, are the
Father’s. Hear Him in another place; “All Mine are Thine, and Thine are
Mine.” <span id="fr_4022"></span>[4023](#fn_4022.md) The question is
finished, as to the things which the Father and the Son have: they have
them with one consent, do not thou introduce <span
id="fr_4023"></span>[4024](#fn_4023.md) dissension. What He calleth the
works of the Father, are His Own works; for, “Thine too are Mine,” for
He speaketh of the works of That Father, to whom He said, “All Mine are
Thine, and Thine are Mine.” So then, My works are Thine, and Thy works
are Mine. “For what things soever the Father doeth;” <span
id="fr_4024"></span>[4025](#fn_4024.md) Himself hath said, the Lord hath
said, the Only-Begotten hath said, the Son hath said, the Truth hath
said. What hath He said? “What things soever the Father doeth, these
also doeth the Son in like manner.” Signal expression! signal truth!
signal equality. “All things that the Father doeth, these doeth the Son
also.” Were it enough to say, “All things that the Father doeth, these
doeth the Son also”? It is not enough; I add, “in like manner.” Why do I
add, “in like manner”? Because they who do not understand, and who walk
with eyes not yet open, are wont to say, “The Father doeth them by way
of command, the Son of obedience, therefore not in like manner.” But if
in like manner, as the One, so the Other; so what things the One, the
same the Other.

<span id="vii.lxxxvii-p14"></span>4. “But,” says he, “the Father
commands, that the Son may execute.” Carnal indeed is thy conceit, but
without prejudice to the truth, I grant it to you. Lo, the Father
commands, the Son obeys; is the Son therefore not of the same Nature,
because the One commands, and the Other obeys? Give me two men, father
and son; they are two men: he that commands is a man; he that obeys is a
man; he that commands and he that obeys have one and the same nature.
Does not he that commands, beget a son of his own nature? Does he who
obeys, by obeying lose his nature? Now take for the present, as you thus
take two men, the Father commanding, the Son obeying, yet God and God.
But the first two together are two men, the Latter together is but One
God; this is a divine miracle. Meanwhile if you would that with you I
acknowledge the obedience, do you first with me acknowledge the Nature.
The Father begat That which Himself is. If the Father begat ought else
than what Himself is, He did not beget a true Son. The Father saith to
the Son, “From the womb before the day-star, I begat <span
id="page_513">p. 513</span> <span
id="vii.lxxxvii-Page_513"></span>Thee.” <span
id="fr_4025"></span>[4026](#fn_4025.md) What is, “before the day-star”? By
the day-star times are signified. So then before times, before all that
is called “before;” before all that is not, or before all that is. For
the Gospel does not say, “In the beginning God made the Word;” as it is
said, “In the beginning God made the Heaven and the earth;” <span
id="fr_4026"></span>[4027](#fn_4026.md) or, “In the beginning was the Word
born;” or, “In the beginning God begat the Word.” But what says it? “He
was, He was, He was.” You hear, “He was;” believe. “In the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” <span
id="fr_4027"></span>[4028](#fn_4027.md) So often do ye hear, “Was:” seek
not for time, for that He always “was.” He then who always was, and was
always with the Son, for that God is able to beget without thee; He said
to the Son, “From the womb before the day-star I begat Thee.” What is
from the womb? Had God a womb? Shall we imagine that God was fashioned
with bodily members? God forbid! And why said He, “From the womb,” but
that it might be understood that He begat Him of His Own Substance? So
then from the womb came forth That which Himself was who begat. For if
He who begat was one thing, and another came forth out of the womb; it
were a monster, not a Son.

<span id="vii.lxxxvii-p18"></span>5. Therefore let the Son do the works
of Him That sent Him, and the Father also do the works of the Son. “At
all events,” you say, “the Father wills, the Son executes.” Lo, I show,
that the Son willeth, and the Father executeth. Do you say, “where dost
thou show this?” I show it at once. “Father, I will.” <span
id="fr_4028"></span>[4029](#fn_4028.md) Now here if I had a mind to cavil,
lo, the Son commandeth, and the Father executeth. What wilt Thou? “That
where I am, they may be also with Me.” We have escaped, there shall we
be, where He is; there shall we be, we have escaped. Who can undo the “I
Will” of the Almighty? You hear the will of His power, hear now the
power of His will. “As the Father” saith He “raiseth up the dead and
quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom He will.”  <span
id="fr_4029"></span>[4030](#fn_4029.md) “Whom He will.” Say not, The Son
quickeneth them, whom the Father commandeth Him to quicken. “He
quickeneth whom He will.” So then whom the Father will, and whom Himself
will: because where there is One Power, there is One Will. Let us then
in a heart blind no more hold fast that the Nature of the Father and the
Son is One and the Same; because the Father is very Father, the Son is
very Son. What He is, That did He beget: because the Begotten was not
degenerate.

<span id="vii.lxxxvii-p21"></span>6. There is a something in the words
of that man who was blind, which may cause perplexity, and peradventure
make many who understand them not aright despair. For he said amongst
the rest of his words, the same man whose eyes were opened, “We know
that God heareth not sinners.” <span
id="fr_4030"></span>[4031](#fn_4030.md) What shall we do, if God heareth
not sinners? Dare we pray to God if He heareth not sinners? Give me one
who may pray: lo, here is One to hear. Give me one who may pray, sift
thoroughly the human race from the imperfect to the perfect. Mount up
from the spring to the summer; for this we have just chanted. “Thou hast
made summer and spring;” <span id="fr_4031"></span>[4032](#fn_4031.md) that
is, “Those who are already spiritual, and those who are still carnal
hast Thou made;” for so the Son Himself saith, “Thine Eyes have seen My
imperfect being.” <span id="fr_4032"></span>[4033](#fn_4032.md) That which
is imperfect in My Body, Thine Eyes have seen. And what then? Have they
who are imperfect hope? Undoubtedly they have. Hear what follows; “And
in Thy Book shall all be written.” But perhaps, Brethren, the spiritual
pray and are heard, because they are not sinners? What then must the
carnal do? What must they do? Shall they perish? Shall they not pray to
God? God forbid! Give me that publican in the Gospel. Come, thou
publican, stand forth, show thy hope, that the weak may not lose hope.
For behold the publican went up with the Pharisee to pray, and with face
cast down upon the ground, standing afar off, beating his breast, he
said, “Lord, be merciful to me a sinner. <span
id="fr_4033"></span>[4034](#fn_4033.md) And he went down justified rather
than the Pharisee.” Said he true or false, who said, “Be merciful to me
a sinner”? If he said true, he was a sinner; yet was he heard and
justified. What then is that, that thou whose eyes the Lord opened didst
say, “We know that God heareth not sinners”? <span
id="fr_4034"></span>[4035](#fn_4034.md) Lo, God doth hear sinners. But wash
thou thy inferior face, let that be done in thy heart, which hath been
done in thy face; and thou wilt see that God doth hear sinners. The
imagination of thine heart hath deceived thee. There is still something
for Him to do to thee. We see that this man was cast out of the
synagogue; Jesus heard of it, came to him, and said to him, “Dost thou
believe on the Son of God?” And He said, “Who is He, Lord, that I should
believe on Him?”  <span id="fr_4035"></span>[4036](#fn_4035.md) He saw, and
did not see; he saw with the eyes, but as yet with the heart he saw not.
The Lord said to him, “Thou both seest Him,” that is, with the eyes;
“and He that talketh with thee is He. <span id="page_514">p. 514</span>
<span id="vii.lxxxvii-Page_514"></span>He then fell down, and worshipped
Him.” <span id="fr_4036"></span>[4037](#fn_4036.md) Then washed he the face
of his heart.

<span id="vii.lxxxvii-p29"></span>7. Apply yourselves then earnestly to
prayer, ye sinners: confess your sins, pray that they may be blotted
out, pray that they may be diminished, pray that as ye increase, they
may decrease: yet do not despair, and sinners though ye be, pray. For
who hath not sinned? Begin with the priests. To the priests it is said,
“First offer sacrifices for your own sins, and so for the people.” <span
id="fr_4037"></span>[4038](#fn_4037.md) The sacrifices convicted the
priests that if any one should call himself righteous and without sin,
it might be answered him, “I look not at what thou sayest, but at what
thou offerest; thine own victim convicteth thee. Wherefore dost thou
offer for thine own sins, if thou have no sins? Dost thou in thy
sacrifice lie unto God?” But peradventure the priests of the ancient
people were sinners; of the new people are not sinners. Of a truth,
Brethren, for that God hath so willed, I am His priest; I am a sinner;
with you do I beat the breast, with you I ask for pardon, with you I
hope that God will be merciful. But peradventure the Holy Apostles,
those first and highest leaders <span
id="fr_4038"></span>[4039](#fn_4038.md) of the flock, shepherds, members of
The Shepherd, these peradventure had no sin. Yes, indeed, even they had,
they had indeed; they are not angry at this, for they confess it. I
should not dare. First hear the Lord Himself saying to the Apostles, “In
this manner pray ye.” <span id="fr_4039"></span>[4040](#fn_4039.md) As
those other priests were convicted by the sacrifices, so these by
prayer. And amongst the other things which He commanded them to pray
for, He appointed this also, “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive
our debtors.” <span id="fr_4040"></span>[4041](#fn_4040.md) What do the
Apostles say? Every day they pray for their debts to be forgiven them.
They come in debtors, they go out absolved, and return debtors to
prayer. This life is not without sin, that as often as prayer is made,
so often should sins be forgiven.

<span id="vii.lxxxvii-p34"></span>8. But what shall I say? Peradventure
when they learnt the prayer, they were still weak. Some one, perhaps,
will say this. When the Lord Jesus taught them that prayer, they were
yet babes, weak, carnal; they were not yet spiritual, who have no sin.
What then, Brethren? When they became spiritual, did they cease to pray?
Then Christ ought to have said, “Pray in such wise now;” and to have
given them, when spiritual, another prayer. It is one and the same. He
who gave it is One and the Same; use it then in prayer in the Church.
But we will take away all controversy, when you say the Holy Apostles
were spiritual, up to the time of the Lord’s Passion they were carnal;
this you must say. And indeed, the truth is, as He was hanging, they
were in alarm, and the Apostles then despaired when the robber believed.
Peter dared to follow, when the Lord was led to suffering, he dared to
follow, who came to the house, and was wearied in the palace, and stood
at the fire, and was cold; he stood at the fire, he was frozen with a
chilling fear. Being questioned by the maid-servant, he denied Christ
once; being questioned a second time, he denied Him; being questioned a
third time, he denied Him. <span id="fr_4041"></span>[4042](#fn_4041.md)
God be thanked, that the questioning ceased; if the questioning had not
ceased, long would the denial have been repeated. So then after He rose
again, then He confirmed them, then did they become spiritual. Had they
at that time then no sin? The Apostles spiritual, wrote spiritual
epistles, they sent them to the Churches; “they had no sin.” This you
say. I do not believe you, I ask themselves. Tell us, O holy Apostles,
after the Lord rose again, and confirmed you with the Holy Ghost sent
from heaven; did ye cease to have sin? Tell us, I pray you. Let us hear,
that sinners may not despair, that they may not leave off to pray to
God, because they are not without sin. Tell us. One of them saith. And
who? He whom the Lord loved the most, and who lay on the Lord’s
Breast, <span id="fr_4042"></span>[4043](#fn_4042.md) and drank in the
mysteries of the kingdom of heaven which he was to pour forth again. Him
I ask; “Have ye sin or not?” He maketh answer and saith, “If we shall
say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
us.” <span id="fr_4043"></span>[4044](#fn_4043.md) Now it is the same John
who said, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God.” <span id="fr_4044"></span>[4045](#fn_4044.md) See ye
what heights he had passed, that he could reach to the Word! Such an
one, and so great, who like an eagle soared above the clouds, who in the
serene clearness of his mind saw, “In the beginning was the Word;” he
hath said, “If we shall say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us. But if we shall confess our sins, He is
faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness.”  <span id="fr_4045"></span>[4046](#fn_4045.md) Therefore
pray ye.
