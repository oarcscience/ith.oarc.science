<span id="vi.v.lxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXIV.—Of the Passage in Which the
Jews are Asked to Say Whose Son They Suppose Christ to Be; And of the
Question Whether There is Not a Discrepancy Between Matthew and the
Other Two Evangelists, in So Far as He States the Inquiry to Have Been,
“What Think Ye of Christ? Whose Son is He?” And Tells Us that to This
They Replied, “The Son of David;” Whereas the Others Put It Thus, “How
Say the Scribes that Christ is David’s Son?”</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxxv-p2"></span>143. Matthew goes on thus: “Now when the
Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, saying, What think
ye of Christ? Whose son is He? They say unto Him, The son of David. He
saith unto them, How then doth David in Spirit call Him Lord, saying,
The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand, till I make Thine
enemies Thy footstool? If David then call Him Lord, how is He his son?
And no man was able to answer Him a word, neither durst any man from
that day forth ask Him any more questions.” <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172.md) This is given also by Mark in due
course, and in the same order. <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173.md) Luke, again, only omits mention of
the person who asked the Lord which was the first commandment in the
law, and, after passing over that incident in silence, observes the same
order once more as the others, narrating just as these, do this question
which the Lord put to the Jews concerning Christ, as to how He was
David’s son. <span id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174.md) Neither is the
sense at all affected by the circumstance that, as Matthew puts it, when
Jesus had asked them what they thought of Christ, and whose son He was,
they \[the Pharisees\] replied, “The son of David,” and then He proposed
the further query as to how David then called Him Lord; whereas,
according to the version presented by the other two, Mark and Luke, we
do not find either that these persons were directly interrogated, or
that they made any answer. For we ought to take this view of the matter,
namely, that these two evangelists have introduced the sentiments which
were expressed by the Lord Himself after the reply made by those
parties, and have recorded the terms in which He spoke in the hearing of
those whom He wished profitably to instruct in His authority, and to
turn away from the teaching of the scribes, and whose knowledge of
Christ amounted then only to this, that He was made of the seed of David
according to the flesh, while they did not understand that He was God,
and on that ground also the Lord even of David. It is in this way,
therefore, that in the accounts given by these two evangelists, the Lord
is mentioned in a manner which makes it appear as if He was discoursing
on the subject of these erroneous teachers to men whom He desired to see
delivered from the errors in which these scribes were involved. Thus,
too, the question, which is presented by Matthew in the form, “What say
ye?” is to be taken not as addressed directly to these \[Pharisees\],
but rather as expressed only with reference to those parties, and
directed really to the persons whom He was desirous of instructing.
