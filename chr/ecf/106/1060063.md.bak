<span id="vi.iv.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Of the Fact that Matthew,
Together with Mark, Had Specially in View the Kingly Character of
Christ, Whereas Luke Dealt with the Priestly.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p2"></span>5. For the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the
one true King and the one true Priest, the former to rule us, and the
latter to make expiation for us, has shown us how His own figure bore
these two parts together, which were only separately commended \[to
notice\] among the Fathers. <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) This
becomes apparent if (for example) we look to that inscription which was
affixed to His cross—“King of the Jews:” in connection also with which,
and by a secret instinct, Pilate replied, “What I have written, I have
written.” <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) For it had been said
aforetime in the Psalms, “Destroy not the writing of the title.” <span
id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) The same becomes evident, so far as
the part of priest is concerned, if we have regard to what He has taught
us concerning offering and receiving. For thus it is that He sent us
beforehand a prophecy <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) respecting
Himself, which runs thus, “Thou art a priest for ever, after the order
of Melchisedek.” <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) And in many
other testimonies of the divine Scriptures, Christ appears both as King
and as Priest. Hence, also, even David himself, whose son He is, not
without good reason, more frequently declared to be than he is said to
be Abraham’s son, and whom Matthew and Luke have both alike held by,—the
one viewing him as the person from whom, through Solomon, His lineage
can be traced down, and the other taking him for the person to whom,
through Nathan, His genealogy can be carried up,—did represent the part
of a priest, although he was patently a king, when he ate the
shew-bread. For it was not lawful for any one to eat that, save the
priests only. <span id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) To this it must be
added that Luke is the only one who mentions how Mary was discovered by
the angel, and how she was related to Elisabeth, <span
id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) who was the wife of Zacharias the
priest. And of this Zacharias the same evangelist has recorded the fact,
that the woman whom he had for wife was one of the daughters of Aaron,
which is to say she belonged to the tribe of the priests. <span
id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md)

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p11"></span>6. Whereas, then, Matthew had in view
the kingly character, and Luke the priestly, they have at the same time
both set forth pre-eminently the humanity of Christ: for it was
according to His humanity that Christ was made both King and Priest. To
Him, too, God gave the throne of His father David, in order that of His
kingdom there should be none end. <span
id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md) And this was done with the purpose
that there might be a mediator between God and men, the man Christ
Jesus, <span id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) to make intercession for
us. Luke, on the other hand, had no one connected with him to act as his
summarist in the way that Mark was attached to Matthew. And it may be
that this is not without a certain solemn significance. <span
id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) For it is the right of kings not to
miss the obedient following of attendants; and hence the evangelist, who
had taken it in hand to give an account of the kingly character of
Christ, had a person attached to him as his associate who was in some
fashion to follow in his steps. But inasmuch as it was the priest’s want
to enter all alone into the holy of holies, in accordance with that
principle, Luke, whose object contemplated the priestly office of
Christ, did not have any one to come after him as a confederate, who was
meant in some way to serve as an epitomizer of his narrative. <span
