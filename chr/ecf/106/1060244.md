<span id="vii.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span

<span id="vii.xxvii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xxvii-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. xiv.
24](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#024.md)<span id="vii.xxvii-p3.2"></span>,
“But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the
waves.”*

<span id="vii.xxvii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xxvii-p4.1"></span>The</span> lesson of the Gospel which we have
just heard is a lesson of humility to us all, that we may see and know
where we are, and whither we must tend and hasten. For that ship which
carries the disciples, which was tossed in the waves by a contrary wind,
is not without its meaning. Nor without a meaning <span
id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540.md) did the Lord after He had left the
multitudes, go up into a mountain to pray alone; and then coming to His
disciples found them in danger, walking on the sea, and getting up into
the ship strengthened them, and appeased the waves. But what marvel if
He can appease all things who created all? Nevertheless after He was
come up into the ship, they who were being borne in her, came saying,
“Of a truth Thou art the Son of God.” <span
id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541.md) But before this plain discovery of
Himself <span id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542.md) they were troubled,
saying, “It is a phantom.” <span id="fr_2543"></span>[2544](#fn_2543.md)
But He coming up into the ship took away the fluctuation of mind from
their hearts, when they were now more endangered in their souls by
doubting, than before in their bodies by the waves.

<span id="vii.xxvii-p9"></span>2. Yet in all this that the Lord did, He
instructs us as to the nature of our life here. In this world there is
not a man who is not a stranger; though all do not desire to return to
their own country. Now by this very journey we are exposed to waves and
tempests; but we must needs be at least in the ship. For if there be
perils in the ship, without the ship there is certain destruction. For
whatever strength of arm he may have who swims in the open sea, yet in
time he is carried away and sunk, mastered by the greatness of its
waves. Need then there is that we be in the ship, that is, that we be
carried in the wood, that we may be able to cross this sea. Now this
Wood in which our weakness is carried is the Cross of the Lord, by which
we are signed, and delivered from the dangerous tempests <span
id="fr_2544"></span>[2545](#fn_2544.md) of this world. We are exposed to
the violence of the waves; but He who helpeth us is God.

<span id="vii.xxvii-p11"></span>3. For in that when the Lord had left
the multitudes, “He went up alone into a mountain to pray;” <span
id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545.md) that mountain signifies the height
of heaven. For having left the multitudes, the Lord after His
Resurrection ascended Alone into heaven, and “there,” as the Apostle
says, “He maketh intercession for us.” <span
id="fr_2546"></span>[2547](#fn_2546.md) There is some meaning then in His
“leaving the multitudes, and going up into a mountain to pray Alone.”
For He Alone is as yet the First-begotten from the dead, after the
resurrection of His Body, unto the right hand of the Father, the High
Priest and Advocate of our prayers. The Head of the Church is above,
that the rest of the members may follow at the end. If then “He maketh
intercession for us,” above the height of all creatures, as it were on
the mountain top, “He prayeth Alone.”

<span id="vii.xxvii-p14"></span>4. Meanwhile the ship which carries the
disciples, that is, the Church, is tossed and shaken by the tempests of
temptation; and the contrary wind, that is, the devil her adversary,
rests not, and strives to hinder her from arriving at rest. But greater
is “He who maketh intercession for us.” For in this our tossing to and
fro in which we toil, He giveth us confidence in coming to us, and
strengthening us; only let us not in our trouble throw ourselves out of
the ship, and cast ourselves into the sea. For though the ship be in
trouble, still it is the ship. She alone carrieth the disciples, and
receiveth Christ. There is danger, it is true, in the sea; but without
her there is instant perishing. Keep thyself therefore in the ship, and
pray to God. For when all counsels fail, when even the rudder is
unserviceable, and the very spreading of the sails is rather dangerous
than useful, when all human help and strength is gone, there remains
only for the sailors the earnest cry of entreaty, <span id="page_338">p.
338</span> <span id="vii.xxvii-Page_338"></span>and pouring out of
prayer to God. He then who grants to sailors to reach the haven, shall
He so forsake His own Church, as not to bring it on to rest?

<span id="vii.xxvii-p15"></span>5. Yet, Brethren, this exceeding trouble
is not in this ship, save only in the absence of the Lord. What! can he
who is in the Church, have his Lord absent from him? When has he his
Lord absent from him? When he is overcome by any lust. For as we find it
said in a certain place in a figure, <span
id="fr_2547"></span>[2548](#fn_2547.md) “Let not the sun go down upon your
wrath: neither give place to the devil:” <span
id="fr_2548"></span>[2549](#fn_2548.md) and this is understood not of this
visible sun which holds as it were the zenith of glory among the rest of
the visible creation, and which can be seen equally by us and by the
beasts; but of that Light which none but the pure hearts of the faithful
see; as it is written, “That was the true Light, which lighteneth every
man that cometh into the world.” <span
id="fr_2549"></span>[2550](#fn_2549.md) For this light of the visible sun
“lighteneth” even the minutest and smallest animals. Righteousness then
and wisdom is that true light, which the mind ceases to see, when it is
overcome by the disordering of anger as by a cloud; and then, as it
were, the sun goes down upon a man’s wrath. So also in this ship, when
Christ is absent, every one is shaken by his own storms, and iniquities,
and evil desires. For, for example, the law tells thee, “Thou shall not
bear false witness.” If thou observe the truth of witness, thou hast
light in the soul; but if overcome by the desire of filthy lucre, thou
hast determined in thy mind to speak false witness, thou wilt at once
begin through Christ’s absence to be troubled by the tempest, thou wilt
be tossed to and fro by the waves of thy covetousness, thou wilt be
endangered by the violent storm of thy lusts, and as it were through
Christ’s absence be well nigh sunk.

<span id="vii.xxvii-p19"></span>6. What cause of fear is there, lest the
ship be diverted from her course, and take a backward direction; which
happens when, abandoning the hope of heavenly rewards, desire turneth
the helm, and a man is turned to those things which are seen and pass
away! For whosoever is disturbed by the temptations of lusts, and
nevertheless still looks into those things which are within, is not so
utterly in a desperate state, if he beg pardon for his faults, and exert
himself to overcome and surmount the fury of the raging sea. But he who
is so turned aside from what he was, as to say in his heart, “God does
not see me; for He does not think of me, nor care whether I sin;” he
hath turned the helm, borne away by the storm, and driven back to the
point he came from. For there are many thoughts in the hearts of men;
and when Christ is absent, the ship is tossed by the waves of this
world, and by tempests manifold.

<span id="vii.xxvii-p20"></span>7. Now the fourth watch of the night, is
the end of the night; for each watch consists of three hours. It
signifies then, that now in the end of the world the Lord is come to
help, and is seen to walk upon the waters. For though this ship be
tossed about by the storms of temptations, yet she sees her Glorified
God walking above all the swellings of the sea; that is, above all the
principalities of this world. For before it was said by an expression
suited to the time of His Passion, <span
id="fr_2550"></span>[2551](#fn_2550.md) when according to the flesh He
showed forth an example of humility, that the waves of the sea vainly
raged <span id="fr_2551"></span>[2552](#fn_2551.md) against Him, to which
He yielded voluntarily for our sakes, that that prophecy, “I am come
into the depths of the sea, and the floods overflow Me,” <span
id="fr_2552"></span>[2553](#fn_2552.md) might be fulfilled. For He did not
repel the false witnesses, nor the savage shout of those that said, “Let
Him be crucified.” He did not by His power repress the savage hearts and
words of those furious men, but in patience endured them all. They did
unto Him whatsoever they listed; because He “became obedient to death,
even the death of the Cross.” <span id="fr_2553"></span>[2554](#fn_2553.md)
But after that He was risen from the dead, that He might pray alone for
His disciples placed in the Church as in a ship, and borne on in the
faith of His Cross, as in wood, and in peril through this world’s
temptations as through the waves of the sea; His Name began to be
honoured even in this world in which He was despised, accused, and
slain; that He who in the dispensation of His suffering in the flesh,
“had come into the depths of the sea, and the floods had overwhelmed
Him,” might now through the glory of His Name tread upon the necks of
the proud as on the foaming waters. Just as we now see the Lord walking
as it were upon the sea, under whose feet we behold the whole madness of
this world subjected.

<span id="vii.xxvii-p25"></span>8. But to the perils of tempests are
added also the errors of heretics; and there are not wanting those who
so try the minds of them that are in the ship, as to say that
Christ <span id="fr_2554"></span>[2555](#fn_2554.md) was not born of a
Virgin, nor had a real body, but seemed to the eyes what He was not. And
these opinions of heretics have sprung up now, when the Name of Christ
is already glorified throughout all nations; when Christ, that is, is as
it were now walking on the sea. The disciples in their trial said, “It
is a phantom.” <span id="fr_2555"></span>[2556](#fn_2555.md) But He giveth
us strength against these pestilent opinions by His own voice, “Be of
good cheer, it is I; be not afraid.” <span
id="fr_2556"></span>[2557](#fn_2556.md) For men in vain fear have conceived
these opinions <span id="page_339">p. 339</span> <span
id="vii.xxvii-Page_339"></span>concerning Christ, looking at his Honour
and Majesty; and they think that He could not be so born, who hath
deserved to be so Glorified, fearing Him as it were “walking on the
sea.” For by this action the excellency of His honour is figured; and so
they think that He was a phantom. But when he saith, “It is I;” what
else doth He say but that there is nothing in Him which does not really
exist? Accordingly if He showeth His flesh, it is flesh; if bones, they
are bones; if scars, they are scars. For “there was not in Him yea and
nay, but in Him was yea,” <span id="fr_2557"></span>[2558](#fn_2557.md) as
the Apostle says. Hence that expression, “Be of good cheer, it is I; be
not afraid.” That is, do not so stand in awe of My Majesty, as to wish
to take away the reality of My Being from Me. Though I walk upon the
sea, though I have under My feet the elation and the pride of this
world, as the raging waves, yet have I appeared as very Man, yet does My
Gospel proclaim the very truth concerning Me, that I was born of a
Virgin, that I am the Word made flesh; that I said truly, “Handle Me,
and see, for a spirit hath not bones as ye see Me have,” <span
id="fr_2558"></span>[2559](#fn_2558.md) that they were true impresses of My
wounds which the hands of the doubting Apostle handled. And therefore
“It is I; be not afraid.”

<span id="vii.xxvii-p31"></span>9. But this, that the disciples thought
He was a phantom, does not represent these only, does not designate them
only who deny that the Lord had human flesh, and who sometimes by their
blind perverseness disturb even those who are in the ship; but those
also who think that the Lord has in anything spoken falsely, and who do
not believe that the things which He has threatened the ungodly will
come to pass. As though He were partly true, and partly false, appearing
like a phantom in His words, as though He were something which is “yea
and nay.” But they who understand His voice aright, who saith, “It is I;
be not afraid;” believe at once all the words of the Lord, so that as
they hope for the rewards He promises, so do they fear the punishments
He threatens. For as that is true which He will say to those who are set
on the right hand, “Come, ye blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world;”  <span
id="fr_2559"></span>[2560](#fn_2559.md) so is that true, which they on the
left hand will hear, “Depart ye into everlasting fire, prepared for the
devil and his Angels.” <span id="fr_2560"></span>[2561](#fn_2560.md) For
this very opinion, by which men think that Christ’s threatenings against
the unrighteous and the abandoned are not true, has arisen from this,
that they see many nations and multitudes innumerable subject to His
Name; so that hence Christ appears to them to be a phantom, because He
walked upon the sea; that is, He seems to speak falsely in His threats
of punishment, because, as it were, He cannot destroy such numberless
people who are subject to His Name and honour. But let them hear Him,
saying, “It is I;” let them not therefore “be afraid,” who believing
Christ to be true in all things, not only seek after what He hath
promised, but avoid also what He hath threatened; because though He walk
upon the sea, that is, though all the nations of men in this world are
subject unto Him; yet is He no phantom, and therefore He doth not speak
falsely, when He saith, “Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord,
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.”  <span
id="fr_2561"></span>[2562](#fn_2561.md)

<span id="vii.xxvii-p35"></span>10. What then does Peter’s daring to
come to Him on the waters also signify? For Peter generally stands for a
figure of the Church. What else then do we think is meant by, “Lord, if
it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the water;” <span
id="fr_2562"></span>[2563](#fn_2562.md) but, Lord, if Thou art true, and in
nothing speakest falsely, let Thy Church also be glorified in this
world, because prophecy hath proclaimed this concerning Thee. Let her
walk then on the waters, and so let her come to Thee, to whom it is
said, “The rich among the people shall entreat Thy favour.” <span
id="fr_2563"></span>[2564](#fn_2563.md) But since to the Lord the praise of
men is no temptation, but men are ofttimes in the Church disordered by
human praises and honours, and well nigh sunk by them; therefore did
Peter tremble in the sea, terrified at the great violence of the storm.
For who does not fear those words, “They who call thee blessed cause
thee to err, and disturb the ways of thy feet?” <span
id="fr_2564"></span>[2565](#fn_2564.md) And because the soul hath much
wrestling against the eager desire of human praise, good is it in such
peril to betake one’s self to prayer and earnest entreaty: lest haply he
who is charmed with praise, be overwhelmed and sunk by blame. Let Peter
cry out as he totters in the water, and say, “Lord, save me.” For the
Lord will reach forth His hand, and though He chide, saying, “O thou of
little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?” wherefore didst thou not look
straight forward upon Him to whom thou wast making thy way, and glory
only in the Lord? Nevertheless He will snatch him from the waves, and
will not suffer Him to perish, who confesses his own infirmity, and begs
His help. But when they had received the Lord into the ship, and their
faith was strengthened and all doubt removed, and the tempests of the
sea assuaged, so that they were come to a firm and secure landing, they
all worship Him, saying, “Of a truth Thou art the Son of God.” For this
is that everlasting joy, where Truth made manifest, and the Word of God,
and the Wisdom by which all things were made, and the exceeding height
of His Mercy, are both known and loved.

[Next: Sermon XXVI](1060245.md)
