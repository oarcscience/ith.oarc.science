<span id="vii.xiii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xiii-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. vii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.xiii-p3.2"></span>,
“Ask, and it shall be given you;” etc. An exhortation to alms-deeds.*

<span id="vii.xiii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xiii-p4.1"></span>In</span> the lesson of the Holy Gospel the
Lord hath exhorted us to prayer. “Ask,” saith He, “and it shall be given
you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to
him that knocketh it shall be opened. Or what man is there of you, whom
if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish,
will he give him a serpent?  <span id="fr_2134"></span>[2135](#fn_2134.md)
Or if he ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? <span
id="fr_2135"></span>[2136](#fn_2135.md) If ye then,” saith He, “though ye
be evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more
shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask
Him? <span id="fr_2136"></span>[2137](#fn_2136.md) Though ye be evil,” He
saith, “ye know how to give good <span id="page_295">p. 295</span> <span
id="vii.xiii-Page_295"></span>gifts unto your children.” A marvellous
thing, Brethren! we are evil: yet have we a good Father. What is more
evident? We have heard our proper name: “Though ye be evil, ye know how
to give good gifts unto your children.” And now see what kind of Father
He showeth them, whom he called evil. “How much more shall your Father?”
Father of whom? undoubtedly of the evil. And what kind of Father? “None
is good but God only.” <span id="fr_2137"></span>[2138](#fn_2137.md)

<span id="vii.xiii-p9"></span>2. For this cause have we who are evil a
good Father, that we may not always continue evil. No evil man can make
another man good. If no evil man can make another good, how can an evil
man make himself good? He only can make of an evil man a good man, who
is good eternally. “Heal me, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall
be saved.” <span id="fr_2138"></span>[2139](#fn_2138.md) Why then do those
vain ones <span id="fr_2139"></span>[2140](#fn_2139.md) say to me in words
vain as themselves, “Thou canst save thyself if thou wilt”? “Heal me, O
Lord, and I shall be healed.” We were created good by The Good; for “God
made man upright,” <span id="fr_2140"></span>[2141](#fn_2140.md) but by our
own free will, we became evil. We had power from being good to become
evil, and we shall have power from being evil to become good. But it is
He who is ever Good, who maketh the good out of the evil; for man by his
own will had no power to heal himself. Thou dost not look out for a
physician to wound thyself; but when thou hast wounded thyself, thou
lookest out for one to cure thee. Good things then after the time
present, temporal good things, such as are concerned with the body and
flesh, we do know how to give to our children, even though we are evil.
For even these are good things, who would doubt it? A fish, an egg,
bread, fruit, wheat, the light we see, the air we breathe, all these are
good; the very riches by which men are lifted up, and which make them
loth to acknowledge other men to be their equals; by which, I say, men
are lifted up rather in love of their dazzling clothing, than with any
thought of their common nature, even these riches, I repeat, are good;
but all these goods which I have now mentioned may be possessed by good
and bad alike; and though they be good themselves, yet cannot they make
their owners good.

<span id="vii.xiii-p13"></span>3. A good then there is which maketh
good, and a good there is whereby thou mayest do good. The Good which
maketh good is God. For none can make man good, save He who is Good
eternally. Therefore that thou mayest be good, call upon God. But there
is another good whereby thou mayest do good, and that is, whatever thou
mayest possess. There is gold, there is silver; they are good, not such
as can make thee good, but whereby thou mayest do good. Thou hast gold
and silver, and thou desirest more gold and silver. Thou both hast, and
desirest to have; thou art at once full, and thirsty. This is a disease,
not opulence. When men are in the dropsy, <span
id="fr_2141"></span>[2142](#fn_2141.md) they are full of water, and yet are
always thirsty. They are full of water, and yet they thirst for water.
How then canst thou take pleasure in opulence, who hast thereby this
dropsical desire? Gold then thou hast, it is good; yet thou hast not
whereby thou canst be made good, but whereby thou canst do good. Dost
thou ask, What good can I do with gold? Hast thou not heard in the
Psalm, “He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor, his
righteousness remaineth for ever.”  <span
id="fr_2142"></span>[2143](#fn_2142.md) This is good, this is the good
whereby thou art made good; righteousness. If thou have the good whereby
thou art made good, do good with that good which cannot make thee good.
Thou hast money, deal it out freely. By dealing it out freely, thou
increasest righteousness. “For he hath dispersed abroad, hath
distributed, hath given to the poor; his righteousness remaineth for
ever.” See what is diminished and what increased. Thy money is
diminished, thy righteousness increased. That is diminished which thou
must soon have lost, that diminished which thou must soon have left
behind thee; that increased which thou shalt possess for ever.

<span id="vii.xiii-p16"></span>4. It is then a secret of gainful dealing
I am giving; learn so to trade. For thou dost commend the merchant who
selleth lead and getteth gold, and wilt thou not commend the merchant,
who layeth out money, and getteth righteousness? But thou wilt say, I do
not lay out my money, because I have not righteousness. Let him who has
righteousness lay his money out; I have not righteousness, so at least
let me have my money. Dost thou not then wish to lay out thy money,
because thou hast not righteousness? Yea, lay it out then rather that
thou mayest have righteousness. For from whence shalt thou have
righteousness but from God, the Fountain of righteousness? Therefore, if
thou wilt have righteousness, be God’s beggar, who just now out of the
Gospel urged thee to ask, and seek, and knock. He knew His beggar, and
lo the Householder, the mighty rich One, rich, to wit, in riches
spiritual and eternal, exhorteth thee and saith, “Ask, seek, knock; he
that asketh receiveth, he that seeketh findeth, to him that knocketh it
shall be opened.” <span id="fr_2143"></span>[2144](#fn_2143.md) He
exhorteth thee to ask, and will he refuse thee what thou askest?

<span id="vii.xiii-p18"></span>5. Consider a similitude or comparison
drawn from a contrary case (as of that unjust judge), which is an
encouragement to us to prayer. “There was,” saith the Lord, “in a city a
cer<span id="page_296">p. 296</span> <span
id="vii.xiii-Page_296"></span>tain judge, which feared not God, neither
regarded man.” <span id="fr_2144"></span>[2145](#fn_2144.md) A certain
widow importuned him daily, and said, “Avenge me.” He would not for a
long time; but she ceased not to petition, and he did through her
importunity what he would not of his own good will. <span
id="fr_2145"></span>[2146](#fn_2145.md) For thus by a contrary case hath He
recommended us to pray.

<span id="vii.xiii-p21"></span>6. Again, He saith, “A certain man to
whom some guest had come, went to his friend, and began to knock and
say, A guest is come to me, lend me three loaves.” He answered, “I am
already in bed, and my servants with me.” The other does not leave off,
but stands and presses his case, and knocks and begs as one friend of
another. And what saith He? “I say unto you that he riseth, and not
because of his friendship,” but “because of the other’s importunity he
giveth him as many as he wanted. Not because of his friendship,” though
he is his friend, but “because of his importunity.” <span
id="fr_2146"></span>[2147](#fn_2146.md) What is the meaning of “because of
his importunity?” Because he did not leave off knocking; because even
when his request was refused, he did not turn away. He who was not
willing to give, gave what was asked, because the other fainted not in
asking. How much more then shall that Good One give who exhorteth us to
ask, who is displeased if we ask not? But when at times He giveth
somewhat slowly, it is that He is showing us the value of His good <span
id="fr_2147"></span>[2148](#fn_2147.md) things; not that He refuses them.
Things which have been long desired, are obtained with the greater
pleasure, whereas those which are given quickly, are held cheap. Ask
then, seek, be instant. By the very asking and seeking thou dost grow so
as to contain the more. God is keeping in reserve for thee, what it is
not His will to give thee quickly, that thou mayest learn for great
things to long with great desire. Therefore “ought we always to pray,
and not to faint.”  <span id="fr_2148"></span>[2149](#fn_2148.md)

<span id="vii.xiii-p25"></span>7. If then God hath made us His beggars
by admonishing, and exhorting, and commanding us to ask, and seek, and
knock, let us for our part pay regard to those who ask from us. We ask,
and from whom do we ask? Who are we that ask? What do we ask? From whom,
or who are we, or what is it that we ask? We ask of the Good God; and we
that ask are evil men; but we ask for righteousness, whereby we may be
good. We ask then for that which we may have for ever, wherewith when we
shall be filled, we shall want no more. But in order that we may be
filled, let us hunger and thirst; hungering and thirsting, let us ask,
and seek, and knock. “For blessed are they who hunger and thirst after
righteousness.” <span id="fr_2149"></span>[2150](#fn_2149.md) Wherefore are
they blessed? They do hunger and thirst, and are they blessed? Is want
ever a blessing? They are not blessed in that they hunger and thirst,
but in that they will be filled. There will there be blessedness, in the
fulness, not in the hunger. But hunger must go before the fulness, that
no loathing attach to the bread.

<span id="vii.xiii-p27"></span>8. We have said then, from whom it is
that we ask, and who we are that ask, and what we ask. But we also are
asked ourselves. For we are God’s mendicants; that He may acknowledge
His mendicants, let us on our part acknowledge ours. But let us think in
this case again, when anything is asked of us, who they are that ask,
from whom they ask, and what they ask? Who then are they that ask? Men.
From whom do they ask? From men. Who are they that ask? Mortals. From
whom? From mortals. Who are they that ask? Frail beings. From whom? From
frail beings. Who are they that ask? Wretches. And from whom? From
wretches. Excepting in the matter of wealth, they that ask are as they
of whom they ask. With what face canst thou ask before thy lord, who
dost not acknowledge thine own equal? “I am not,” he will say, “as he
is,” far be it from me to be such as he. It is thus that one clad in
silk, and puffed up with pride, speaks of one who is wrapped in rags.
But I ask you when you both are stripped. I ask you not as you are now
when clothed, but as you were when you were first born. Both were naked,
both weak, beginning a life of misery, and therefore beginning it with
cries.

<span id="vii.xiii-p28"></span>9. See then, recall, O rich man, to mind
thy first beginnings; see whether thou broughtest anything into the
world. Now thou hast come indeed, and hast found so great abundance. But
tell me, I pray thee, what didst thou bring hither? Tell me, or if thou
art ashamed to say, hear the Apostle. “We brought nothing into this
world.” <span id="fr_2150"></span>[2151](#fn_2150.md) He saith, “We brought
nothing into this world.” But perhaps because thou broughtest in
nothing, but yet hast found much here, thou wilt take away something
hence? This too, peradventure through love of riches, thou art afraid to
confess. Hear this also, and let the Apostle who will not flatter, tell
thee. “We brought nothing into this world,” to wit when we were born;
“neither can we carry anything out,” to wit when we shall depart out of
the world. Thou broughtest in nothing, and thou shalt carry nothing
away. Why then dost thou puff up thyself against the poor man? When
infants first are born, let only the parents, servants, dependants, and
the crowds of obsequious attendants, get out of the way; and then let
the wealthy children with their cries be recognised. Let the rich woman
and the poor give birth together; let them take no <span
id="page_297">p. 297</span> <span id="vii.xiii-Page_297"></span>notice
of their children, let them go away for a little while; then let them
return, and recognise them if they can. See then, O rich man, “thou
broughtest nothing into this world; neither canst thou carry anything
out.” What I have said of them at their birth, I may say of them in
death. If it be not so, when by any chance old sepulchres are broken up,
let the bones of the rich be recognised if they can. Therefore, thou
rich man, give ear to the Apostle, “We brought nothing into this world.”
Acknowledge it, true it is. “Neither can we carry anything out.”
Acknowledge it, this is true also.

<span id="vii.xiii-p30"></span>10. What follows then? “Having food and
covering, let us be therewith content; for they who wish to be rich fall
into temptation, and many and hurtful lusts, which drown men in
destruction and perdition. For avarice is the root of all evil, which
some following after, have erred from the faith.” <span
id="fr_2151"></span>[2152](#fn_2151.md) Now consider what they have
abandoned. Grieved thou art that they have abandoned this, but see now
in what they have entangled themselves. Hear; “They have erred from the
faith, and entangled themselves in many sorrows.” But who? “They who
wish to be rich.” It is one thing to be rich, another to wish to become
rich. He is rich, who is born of rich parents, and he is rich not
because he wished it, but because many left him their inheritances. His
 <span id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152.md) wealth I see, I make no
question as to the pleasure he takes in it. In this Scripture it is
covetousness that is condemned, not gold, or silver, or riches, but
covetousness. For they who do not wish to become rich, or do not care
about it, who do not burn with covetous desires, nor are inflamed by the
fires of avarice, but who yet are rich, let them hear the Apostle (it
has been read to-day), “Charge them that are rich in this world.” <span
id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153.md) Charge them what? Charge them
before all things, not to be proud in their conceits, for there is
nothing which riches do so much generate as pride. Each several fruit,
each several grain of corn, each several tree, has its peculiar worm,
and the worm of the apple is of one kind, and of the pear another, and
of the bean another, and of the wheat another. The worm of riches
is <span id="fr_2154"></span>[2155](#fn_2154.md) pride.

<span id="vii.xiii-p35"></span>11. “Charge therefore the rich of this
world that they be not proud in their conceits.” He hath shut out the
abuse, <span id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155.md) let him teach now the
proper use. “That they be not proud in their conceits.” But whence
cometh the defence against pride? From that which follows: “Nor trust in
the uncertainty of riches.” They who trust not in the uncertainty of
riches, are not proud in their conceits. If they be not proud in their
conceits, let them fear. If they fear, they are not proud in their
conceits. How many are they who were rich yesterday, and are poor
to-day? How many go to sleep rich, and through robbers coming and taking
all away, wake up poor? Therefore “charge them not to trust in the
uncertainty of riches, but in the Living God, who giveth us richly all
things to enjoy,” things temporal, and things eternal. But things
eternal more for enjoyment, the things temporal for use. Things temporal
as for travellers, things eternal as for inhabitants. Things temporal,
whereby we may do good; things eternal, whereby we may be made good.
Therefore let the rich do this, “Let them not be proud in their
conceits, nor trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in the Living God,
who giveth us all things richly to enjoy.” Let them do this. But what
can they do with what they have? Hear what. “Let them be rich in good
works, let them easily distribute.” <span
id="fr_2156"></span>[2157](#fn_2156.md) For they have wherewithal. Why then
do they not do it? Poverty is a hard estate. But they may give easily,
for they have the means. “Let them communicate,” that is, let them
acknowledge their fellow-mortals as their equals. “Let them communicate,
let them lay up for themselves a good foundation against the time to
come.” <span id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157.md) For, saith he, when I
say, “Let them distribute easily, let them communicate,” I have no wish
to spoil, or strip them, or leave them empty. It is a painful lesson I
teach; I show them a place to put their goods, “let them lay up in store
for themselves.” For I have no wish that they should remain in poverty.
“Let them lay up for themselves in store.” I do not bid them lose their
goods, but I show them whither to remove them. “Let them lay up in store
for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may
hold on the true <span id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158.md) life.” The
present then is a false life; let them lay hold on the true life. “For
it is vanity of vanities, and all is vanity. What so great abundance
hath man in all his labour, wherewith he laboureth under the sun?” <span
id="fr_2159"></span>[2160](#fn_2159.md) Therefore the true life must be
laid hold upon, our riches must be removed to the place of the true
life, that we may find there what we give here. He maketh this exchange
of our goods who also changeth ourselves.

<span id="vii.xiii-p41"></span>12. Give then, my brethren, to the poor,
“Having food and covering, let us be therewith content.” The rich man
has nothing from his riches, but what the poor man begs of him, food and
covering. What more hast thou from all that thou possessest? Thou hast
got food and necessary covering. Necessary I say, not useless, not
superfluous. What more dost thou get from thy riches? Tell me. Assuredly
all thou hast more will be superfluous. Let thy superfluities then be
the poor man’s necessaries. But <span id="page_298">p. 298</span> <span
id="vii.xiii-Page_298"></span>thou wilt say, I get costly banquets, I
feed on costly meats. But the poor man, what does he feed on? On cheap
food; the poor man feeds on cheap, and I, says he, on costly meats.
Well, I ask you, when you both are filled, the costly enters into thee,
but when it is once entered, what does it become? If we had but
looking-glasses within us, should we not be put to shame for all the
costly meat whereby thou hast been filled? The poor man hungers, and so
does the rich; the poor man seeks to be filled, so does the rich. The
poor man is filled with inexpensive, the rich with costly meats. Both
are filled alike, the object <span id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160.md)
whither both wish to attain is one and the same, only the one reaches it
by a short, the other by a circuitous way. But thou wilt say, I relish
better my costly food. True, and it is hard for thee to be satisfied,
dainty as thou art. Thou knowest not the relish of that which hunger
seasons. <span id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161.md) Not that I have said
this to force the rich to feed on the meat and drink of the poor. Let
the rich use what their infirmity has accustomed them to; but let them
be sorry, that they are not able to do otherwise. For it would be better
for them if they could. If then the poor man be not puffed up for his
poverty, why shouldest thou for thine infirmity? Use then choice, and
costly meats, because thou art so accustomed, because thou canst not do
otherwise, because if thou dost change thy custom, thou art made ill. I
grant thee this, make use of superfluities, but give to the poor
necessaries; make use of costly meats, but give to the poor inexpensive
food. He is looking to receive from thee, and thou art looking to
receive from God; he is looking to the hand which was made as he was,
and thou art looking to the hand that made thee, and made not thee only,
but the poor man with thee. He set you both one and the same journey,
this present life: you have found yourselves companions in it, you are
walking one way: he is carrying nothing, thou art loaded excessively: he
is carrying nothing with him, thou art carrying with thee more than thou
dost need. Thou art loaded: give him of that thou hast; so shalt thou at
once feed him, and lessen thine own burden.

<span id="vii.xiii-p44"></span>13. Give then to the poor; I beg, I
advise, I charge, I command you. Give to the poor whatever ye will. For
I will not conceal from you, Beloved, why it is that I have deemed it
necessary to deliver this discourse to you. As I am going to and from
the Church, the poor importune me, and beg me to speak to you, that they
may receive something of you. They have urged me to speak to you; and
when they see that they receive nothing from you, they suppose that all
my labour among you is in vain. Something also they expect from me. I
give them all I can; but have I the means sufficient to supply all their
necessities? Forasmuch then as I have not means sufficient to supply all
their necessity, I am at least their ambassador to you. You have heard
and applauded; God be thanked. You have received the seed, you have
returned an answer. But these your commendations weigh me down rather,
and expose me to danger. I bear them, and tremble whilst I bear them.
Nevertheless, my brethren, these your commendations are but the tree’s
leaves; it is the fruit I am in quest of.
