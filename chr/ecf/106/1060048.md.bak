<span id="v.iii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p2"></span>59. And inasmuch as when such things
are either provided against the time <span id="page_54">p. 54</span>
<span id="v.iii.xviii-Page_54"></span>to come, or reserved, if there is
no cause wherefore you should expend them, it is uncertain with what
intention it is done, since it may be done with a single heart, and also
with a double one, He has seasonably added in this passage: “Judge
not, <span id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) that ye be not
judged. <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) For with what judgment
ye judge, ye shall be judged, <span id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md)
and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.” In
this passage, I am of opinion that we are taught nothing else, but that
in the case of those actions respecting which it is doubtful with what
intention they are done, we are to put the better construction on them.
For when it is written, “By their fruits ye shall know them,” the
statement has reference to things which manifestly cannot be done with a
good intention; such as debaucheries, or blasphemies, or thefts, or
drunkenness, and all such things, of which we are permitted to judge,
according to the apostle’s statement: “For what have I to do to judge
them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?” <span
id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) But concerning the kind of food,
because every kind of human food can be taken indiscriminately with a
good intention and a single heart, without the vice of concupiscence,
the same apostle forbids that they who ate flesh and drank wine be
judged by those who abstained from such kinds of sustenance: “Let not
him that eateth,” says he, “despise him that eateth not; and let not him
which eateth not, judge him that eateth.” There also he says: “Who art
thou that judges another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or
falleth.” <span id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) For in reference to
such matters as can be done with a good and single and noble intention,
although they may also be done with an intention the reverse of good,
those parties wished, howbeit they were \[mere\] men, to pronounce
judgment upon the secrets of the heart, of which God alone is Judge.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p8"></span>60. To this category belongs also what
he says in another passage: “Therefore judge nothing before the time,
until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of
darkness, and will make manifest the thoughts <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) of the hearts: and then shall every
man have praise of God.” <span id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) There
are therefore certain ambiguous actions, respecting which we are
ignorant with what intention they are performed, because they may be
done both with a good or with an evil one, of which it is rash to judge,
especially for the purpose of condemning. Now the time will come for
these to be judged, when the Lord “will bring to light the hidden things
of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts.” In
another passage also the same apostle says: “Some men’s aims are
manifest beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow
after.” He calls those sins manifest, with regard to which it is clear
with what intention they are done; these go before to judgment, because
if a judgment shall follow, it is not rash. But those which are
concealed follow, because neither shall they remain hid in their own
time. So we must understand with respect to good works also. For he adds
to this effect: “Likewise also the good works of some are manifest
beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.” <span
id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) Let us judge, therefore, with respect
to those which are manifest; but respecting those which are concealed,
let us leave the judgment to God: for they also cannot be hid, whether
they be good or evil, when the time shall come for them to be
manifested.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p12"></span>61. There are two things, moreover, in
which we ought to beware of rash judgment; when it is uncertain with
what intention any thing is done; or when it is uncertain what sort of a
person he is going to be, who at preset is manifestly either good or
bad. If, therefore, any one, for example, complaining of his stomach,
would not fast, and you, not believing this, were to attribute it to the
vice of gluttony, you would judge rashly. Likewise, if you were to come
to know the gluttony and drunkenness as being manifest, and were so to
administer reproof as if the man could never be amended and changed, you
would nevertheless judge rashly. Let us not therefore reprove those
things about which we do not know with what intention they are done; nor
let us so reprove those things which are manifest, as that we should
despair of a return to a right state of mind; and thus we shall avoid
the judgment of which in the present instance it is said, “Judge not,
that ye be not judged.”

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p13"></span>62. But what He says may cause
perplexity: “For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and
with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.” Is it the
case, then, that if we shall judge any thing with a rash judgment, God
will also judge rashly with respect to us? or if we shall measure any
thing with an unjust measure, is there with God also an unjust measure,
according to which it shall be measured to us again? (for by the
expression measure also, I suppose the judgment itself is meant.) By no
means does God either judge rashly, or recompense to any one with an
unjust measure; but it is so expressed, inasmuch as <span
id="page_55">p. 55</span> <span id="v.iii.xviii-Page_55"></span>that
very same rashness wherewith you punish another must necessarily punish
yourself. Unless, perchance, it is to be imagined that injustice does
harm in some way to him against whom it goes forth, but in no way to him
from whom it goes forth; but nay, it often does no harm to him who
suffers the injury, but it must necessarily do harm to him who inflicts
it. For what harm did the injustice of the persecutors do to the
martyrs? None; but very much to the persecutors themselves. For although
some of them were turned from the error of their ways, yet at the time
at which they were acting as persecutors, their wickedness was blinding
them. So also a rash judgment frequently does no harm to him who is the
object of the rash judgment; but to him who judges rashly, the rashness
itself must necessarily do harm. According to such a rule, I judge of
that saying also: “Every one that strikes <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) with the sword shall perish with the
sword.” <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) For how many take the
sword, and yet do not perish with the sword, Peter himself being an
instance! But lest any should think that he escaped such punishment by
the pardon of his sins (although nothing could be more absurd than to
think that the punishment of the sword, which did not befall Peter,
could have been greater than that of the cross, which actually befell
him), yet what would they say of the malefactors who were crucified with
our Lord; for both he who got pardon, got it after he was crucified, and
the other did not get it at all? <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md)
Or had they perhaps crucified all whom they had slain; and did they
therefore themselves too deserve to suffer the same thing? It is
ridiculous to think so. For what else is meant by the statement, “For
all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword,” but that the
soul dies by that very sin, whatever it may be, which it has committed?
