id="vi.v.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIV.—Of the Occasion on Which He
Announced His Coming Passion to the Disciples, and of the Measure of
Concord Between Matthew, Mark, and Luke in the Accounts Which They Give
of the Same.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lv-p2"></span>110. Matthew proceeds in the following
strain: “Then charged He His disciples that they should tell no man that
He was Jesus the Christ. From that time forth began Jesus to show unto
His disciples how that He must go into Jerusalem, and suffer many things
of the elders, and chief priests, and scribes;” and so on, down to where
we read, “Thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that
be of men.” <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092) Mark and Luke add
these passages in the same order. Only Luke says nothing about the
opposition which Peter expressed to the passion of Christ.
