<span id="vi.v.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Of the Section Where It is
Recorded, that Being Moved with Compassion for the Multitudes, He Sent
His Disciples, Giving Them Power to Work Cures, and Charged Them with
Many Instructions, Directing Them How to Live; And of the Question
Concerning the Proof of Matthew’s Harmony Here with Mark and Luke,
Especially on the Subject of the Staff, Which Matthew Says the Lord Told
Them They Were Not to Carry, While According to Mark It is the Only
Thing They Were to Carry; And Also of the Wearing of the Shoes and
Coats.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxxi-p2"></span>70. As to the events next related, it is
true that their exact order is not made apparent by Matthew’s narrative.
For after the notices of the two incidents in connection with the blind
men and the dumb demoniac, he continues in the following manner: “And
Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their
synagogues, and preaching the kingdom of the gospel, <span
id="fr_960"></span>[961](#fn_960.md) and healing every sickness and every
disease. But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion on
them, because they were troubled and prostrate, <span
id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961.md) as sheep having no shepherd. Then
saith He unto His disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the
labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He
will send forth <span id="fr_962"></span>[963](#fn_962.md) labourers into
His harvest. And when He had called unto Him His twelve disciples, He
gave them power against unclean spirits;” and so forth, down to the
words, “Verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.” <span
id="fr_963"></span>[964](#fn_963.md) This whole passage which we have now
mentioned shows how He gave many counsels to His disciples. But whether
Matthew has subjoined this section in its historical order, or has made
its order dependent only on the succession in which it came up to his
own mind, as has already been said, is not made apparent. Mark appears
to have handled this paragraph in a succinct method, and to have entered
upon its recital in the following terms: “And He went round about the
villages, teaching in their circuit: <span
id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964.md) and He called unto Him the twelve, and
began to send them by two and two, and gave them power over unclean
spirits;” and so on, down to where we read, “Shake off the dust from
your feet for a testimony against them.” <span
id="fr_965"></span>[966](#fn_965.md) But before narrating this incident,
Mark has inserted, immediately after the story of the raising of the
daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, an account of what took place on
that occasion on which, in His own country, the people were astonished
at the Lord, and asked from whence He had such wisdom and such
capabilities, <span id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966.md) when they
perceived His judgment: which account is given by Matthew after these
counsels to the disciples, and after a number of other matters. <span
id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967.md) It is uncertain, therefore, whether
what thus happened in His own country has been recorded by Matthew in
the succession in which it came to mind, after having been omitted at
first, or whether it has been introduced by Mark in the way of an
anticipation; and which of them, in short, has kept the order of actual
occurrence, and which of them the order of his own recollection. Luke,
again, in immediate succession to the mention of the raising of the
daughter of Jairus to life, subjoins this paragraph, bearing on the
<span id="page_137">p. 137</span> <span
id="vi.v.xxxi-Page_137"></span>power and the counsels given to the
disciples, and that indeed with as great brevity as Mark. <span
id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968.md) This evangelist, however, does not,
any more than the others, introduce the subject in such a way as to
produce the impression that it comes in also in the strictly historical
order. Moreover, with regard to the names of the disciples, Luke, who
gives their names in another place, <span
id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969.md) —that is to say, in the earlier
passage, where they are \[represented as being\] chosen on the
mountain,—is not at variance in any respect with Matthew, with the
exception of the single instance of the name of Judas the brother of
James, whom Matthew designates Thaddæus, although some codices also read
Lebbæus. <span id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970.md) But who would ever
think of denying that one man may be known under two or three names?

<span id="vi.v.xxxi-p14"></span>71. Another question which it is also
usual to put is this: How comes it that Matthew and Luke have stated
that the Lord said to His disciples that they were not to take a staff
with them, whereas Mark puts the matter in this way: “And He commanded
them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff
only;” <span id="fr_971"></span>[972](#fn_971.md) and proceeds further in
this strain, “no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:” thereby
making it quite evident that his narrative belongs to the same place and
circumstances with which the narratives of those others deal who have
mentioned that the staff was not to be taken? Now this question admits
of being solved on the principle of understanding that the staff which,
according to Mark, was to be taken, bears one sense, and that the staff
which, according to Matthew and Luke, was not to be taken with them, is
to be interpreted in a different sense; just in the same way as we find
the term “temptation” used in one meaning, when it is said, “God
tempteth no man,” <span id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972.md) and in a
different meaning where it is said, “The Lord your God tempteth
\[proveth\] you, to know whether ye love Him.” <span
id="fr_973"></span>[974](#fn_973.md) For in the former case the temptation
of seduction is intended; but in the latter the temptation of probation.
Another parallel occurs in the case of the term “judgment,” which must
be taken in one way, where it is said, “They that have done good unto
the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the
resurrection of judgment;” <span id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974.md) and
in another way, where it is said, “Judge me, O God, and discern <span
id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975.md) my cause, in respect of an ungodly
nation.” <span id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976.md) For the former refers
to the judgment of damnation, and the latter to the judgment of
discrimination.

<span id="vi.v.xxxi-p21"></span>72. And there are many other words which
do not retain one uniform signification, but are introduced so as to
suit a variety of connections, and thus are understood in a variety of
ways, and sometimes, indeed, are adopted along with an explanation. We
have an example in the saying, “Be not children <span
id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977.md) in understanding; howbeit in malice be
ye little children, that in understanding ye may be perfect.” <span
id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978.md) For here is a sentence which, in a
brief and pregnant form, might have been expressed thus: “Be ye not
children; howbeit be ye children.” The same is the case with the words,
“If any man among you thinketh himself to be wise in this world, let him
become a fool that he may be wise.” <span
id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979.md) For what else is the statement there
but this: “Let him not be wise, that he may be wise”? Moreover, the
sentences are sometimes so put as to exercise the judgment of the
inquirer. An instance of this kind occurs in what is said in the Epistle
to the Galatians: “Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so ye will fulfil
the law of Christ. For if a man thinketh himself to be something, when
he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. But it is meet that every man
should prove his own work; and then shall he have rejoicing in himself,
and not in another. For every man shall bear his own burden.” <span
id="fr_980"></span>[981](#fn_980.md) Now, unless the word “burden” can be
taken in different senses, without doubt one would suppose that the same
writer contradicts himself in what he says here, and that, too, when the
words are placed in such close neighbourhood in one paragraph. <span
id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981.md) For when he has just said, “One shall
bear another’s burdens,” after the lapse of a very brief interval he
says, “Every man shall bear his own burden.” But the one refers to the
burdens which are to be borne in sharing in one’s infirmity, the other
to the burdens borne in the rendering of an account of our own actions
to God: the former are burdens to be borne in our \[duties of\]
fellowship with brethren; the latter are those peculiar to ourselves,
and borne by every man for himself. And in the same way, once more, the
“rod” of which the apostle spoke in the words, “Shall I come unto you
with a rod?” <span id="fr_982"></span>[983](#fn_982.md) is meant in a
spiritual sense; while the same term bears the literal meaning when it
occurs of the rod applied to a horse, or used for some other purpose of
the <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span
id="vi.v.xxxi-Page_138"></span>kind, not to mention, in the meantime,
also other metaphorical significations of this phrase.

<span id="vi.v.xxxi-p28"></span>73. Both these counsels, therefore, must
be accepted as having been spoken by the Lord to the apostles; namely,
at once that they should not take a staff, and that they should take
nothing save a staff only. For when He said to them, according to
Matthew, “Provide neither gold nor silver, nor money in your purses, nor
scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet a
staff,” He added immediately, “for the workman is worthy of his meat.”
And by this He makes it sufficiently obvious why it is that He would
have them provide and carry none of these things. He shows that His
reason was, not that these things are not necessary for the sustenance
of this life, but because He was sending them in such a manner as to
declare plainly that these things were due to them by those very persons
who were to hear believingly the gospel preached by them; just as wages
are the soldier’s due, and as the fruit of the vine is the right of the
planters, and the milk of the flock the right of the shepherds. For
which reason Paul also speaks in this wise: “Who goeth a warfare any
time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the
fruit thereof? who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the
flock?” <span id="fr_983"></span>[984](#fn_983.md) For under these figures
he was speaking of those things which are necessary to the preachers of
the gospel. And so, a little further on, he says: “If we have sown unto
you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal
things? If others are partakers of this power over you, are not we
rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power.” <span
id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984.md) This makes it apparent that by these
instructions the Lord did not mean that the evangelists should not seek
their support in any other way than by depending on what was offered
them by those to whom they preached the gospel (otherwise this very
apostle acted contrary to this precept when he acquired a livelihood for
himself by the labours of his own hands, because he would not be
chargeable to any of them <span id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985) .md), but
that He gave them a power in the exercise of which they should know such
things to be their due. Now, when any commandment is given by the Lord,
there is the guilt of non-obedience if it is not observed; but when any
power is given, any one is at liberty to abstain from its use, and, as
it were, to recede from his right. Accordingly, when the Lord spake
these things to the disciples, He did what that apostle expounds more
clearly a little further on, when he says, “Do ye not know that they who
minister in the temple <span id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986.md) live of
the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers
with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach
the gospel should live of the gospel. But I have used none of these
things.” <span id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987.md) When he says,
therefore, that the Lord ordained it thus, but that he did not use the
ordinance, he certainly indicates that it was a power to use that was
given him, and not a necessity of service that was imposed upon him.

<span id="vi.v.xxxi-p34"></span>74. Accordingly, as our Lord ordained
what the apostle declares Him to have ordained,—namely, that those who
preach the gospel should live of the gospel,—He gave these counsels to
the apostles in order that they might be without the care of
providing <span id="fr_988"></span>[989](#fn_988.md) or of carrying with
them things necessary for this life, whether great or the very smallest;
consequently He introduced this term, “neither a staff,” with the view
of showing that, on the part of those who were faithful to Him, all
things were due to His ministers, who themselves, too, required nothing
superfluous. And thus, when He added the words, “For the workman is
worthy of his meat,” He indicated quite clearly, and made it thoroughly
plain, how and for what reason it was that He spake all these things. It
is this kind of power, therefore, that the Lord denoted under the term
“staff,” when He said that they should “take nothing” for their journey,
save a staff only. For the sentence might also have been briefly
expressed in this way: “Take with you none of the necessaries of life,
neither a staff, save a staff only.” So that the phrase “neither a
staff” may be taken to be equivalent to “not even the smallest things;”
while the addition, “save a staff only,” may be understood to mean that,
in virtue of that power which they received from the Lord, and which was
signified by the name “staff” \[or, “rod”\], even those things which
were not carried with them would not be wanting to them. Our Lord
therefore used both phrases. But inasmuch as one and the same evangelist
has not recorded them both, the writer who has told us that the rod, as
introduced in the one sense, was to be taken, is supposed to be in
antagonism to him who has told us that the rod, as occurring again in
the other sense, was not to be taken. After this explanation of the
matter, however, no such supposition ought to be entertained.

<span id="vi.v.xxxi-p36"></span>75. In like manner, also, when Matthew
tells us that the shoes were not to be carried with them on the journey,
what is intended is the checking of that care which thinks that such
things must be carried with them, because otherwise they might be
unprovided. Thus, too, the import of what is said regarding the two
coats is, that none of them should think of taking with him another coat
in addition to the one in <span id="page_139">p. 139</span> <span
id="vi.v.xxxi-Page_139"></span>which he was clad, as if he was afraid
that he might come to be in want, while all the time the power (which
was received from the Lord) made him sure of getting what was needful.
To the same effect, when Mark says that they were to be shod with
sandals or soles, he gives us to understand that this matter of the shoe
has some sort of mystical significance, the point being that the foot is
to be neither covered, nor yet left bare to the ground; by which the
idea may be conveyed that the gospel was neither to be concealed, nor
yet made to depend on the good things of earth. And as to the fact that
what is forbidden is neither the carrying nor the possessing of two
coats, but more distinctly the putting of them on,—the words being, “and
not put on two coats,”—what counsel is conveyed to them therein but
this, that they ought to walk not in duplicity, but in simplicity?

<span id="vi.v.xxxi-p37"></span>76. Thus it is not by any means to be
made a matter of doubt that the Lord Himself spake all these words, some
of them with a literal import, and others of them with a figurative,
although the evangelists may have introduced them only in part into
their writings,—one inserting one section, and another giving a
different portion. Certain passages, at the same time, have been
recorded in identical terms either by some two of them, or by some
three, or even by all the four together. And yet not even when this is
the case can we take it for granted that everything has been committed
to writing which was either uttered or done by Him. Moreover, if any one
fancies that the Lord could not in the course of the same discourse have
used some expressions with a figurative application and others with a
literal, let him but examine His other addresses, and he will see how
rash and inconsiderate such a notion is. For, then (to mention but a
single instance which occurs meantime to my mind), when Christ gives the
counsel not to let the left hand know what the right hand doeth, <span
id="fr_989"></span>[990](#fn_989.md) he may suppose himself under the
necessity of accepting in the same figurative sense at once the
almsgivings themselves referred to, and the other instructions offered
on that occasion.

<span id="vi.v.xxxi-p39"></span>77. In good truth, I must repeat here
once more an admonition which it behoves the reader to keep in mind, so
as not to be requiring that kind of advice so very frequently, namely,
that in various passages of His discourses, the Lord has reiterated much
which He had uttered already on other occasions. It is needful, indeed,
to call this fact to mind, lest, when it happens that the order of such
passages does not appear to fit in with the narrative of another of the
evangelists, the reader should fancy that this establishes some
contradiction between them; whereas he ought really to understand it to
be due to the fact that something is repeated a second time in that
connection which had been already expressed elsewhere. And this is a
remark that should be held applicable not only to His words, but also to
His deeds. For there is nothing to hinder us from believing that the
same thing may have taken place more than once. But for a man to impeach
the gospel simply because he does not believe in the repeated occurrence
of some incident, which no one \[at least\] can prove to be an
impossible event, betrays mere sacrilegious vanity.
