<span id="vi.vi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Of the Proof of Their Freedom
from Any Discrepancies in the Notices Given of the Predictions of
Peter’s Denials.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.iii-p2"></span>5. “Little children, yet a little while I
am with you. Ye shall seek me: and, as I said unto the Jews, Whither I
go, ye cannot come; so now I say unto you. A new commandment I give unto
you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love
one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye
have love one to another. Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, whither
goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me
now, but thou shalt follow me afterwards. Peter saith unto Him, Lord,
why cannot I follow Thee now? I will lay down my life for Thy sake.
Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily,
verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, until thou deniest me
thrice.” <span id="fr_1244"></span>[1245](#fn_1244.md) John, from whose
Gospel I have taken the passage introduced above, is not the only
evangelist who <span id="page_178">p. 178</span> <span
id="vi.vi.iii-Page_178"></span>details this incident of the prophetic
announcement of his own denial to Peter. The other three also record the
same thing. <span id="fr_1245"></span>[1246](#fn_1245.md) They do not,
however, take one and the same particular point in the discourses \[of
Christ\] as their occasion for proceeding to this narration. For Matthew
and Mark both introduce it in a completely parallel order, and at the
same stage of their narrative, namely, after the Lord left the house in
which they had eaten the passover; while Luke and John, on the other
hand, bring it in before He left that scene. Still we might easily
suppose, either that it has been inserted in the way of a recapitulation
by the one couple of evangelists, or that it has been inserted in the
way of an anticipation by the other; only such a supposition may be made
more doubtful by the circumstance that there is so remarkable a
diversity, not only in the Lord’s words, but even in those sentiments of
His by which the incident in question is introduced, and by which Peter
was moved to venture his presumptuous asseveration that he would die
with the Lord or for the Lord. These considerations may constrain us
rather to understand the narratives really to import that the man
uttered his presumptuous declaration thrice over, as it was called forth
by different occasions in the series of Christ’s discourses, and that
also three several times the answer was returned him by the Lord, which
intimated that before the cock crew he would deny Him thrice.

<span id="vi.vi.iii-p5"></span>6. And surely there is nothing incredible
in supposing that Peter was moved to such an act of presumption on
several occasions, separated from each other by certain intervals of
time, as he was actually instigated to deny Him repeatedly. Neither
should it seem unreasonable to fancy that the Lord gave him a reply in
similar terms at three successive periods, especially when \[we see
that\] in immediate connection with each other, and without the
interposition of anything else either in fact or word, Christ addressed
the question to him three several times whether he loved Him, and that,
when Peter returned the same answer thrice over, He also gave him thrice
over the self-same charge to feed His sheep. <span
id="fr_1246"></span>[1247](#fn_1246.md) That it is the more reasonable
thing to suppose that Peter displayed his presumption on three different
occasions, and that thrice over he received from the Lord a warning with
respect to his triple denial, is further proved, as we may see, by the
very terms employed by the evangelists, which record sayings uttered by
the Lord in diverse form and of diverse import. Let us here call
attention again to that passage which I introduced a little ago from the
Gospel of John. There we certainly find that He had expressed Himself in
this way: “Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall
seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so
now I say to you. A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one
another; as I have loved you, that ye love one another. By this shall
all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, whither goest Thou?” <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[1248](#fn_1247.md) Now, surely it is evident here that
what moved Peter to utter this question, “Lord, whither goest Thou?” was
the words which the Lord Himself had spoken. For he had heard Him say,
“Whither I go, ye cannot come.” Then Jesus made this reply to the said
Peter: “Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now, but thou shall
follow me afterwards.” Thereupon Peter expressed himself thus: “Lord,
why cannot I follow Thee now? I will lay down my life for Thy sake.”
 <span id="fr_1248"></span>[1249](#fn_1248.md) And to this presumptuous
declaration the Lord responded by predicting his denial. Luke, again,
first mentions how the Lord said, “Simon, behold Satan hath desired to
have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee,
that thy faith fail not; and, when thou art converted, strengthen thy
brethren:” next he proceeds immediately to tell us how Peter replied to
this effect: “Lord, I am ready to go with Thee, both unto prison and to
death;” and then he continues thus: “And He said, I tell thee, Peter,
the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny
that thou knowest me.” <span id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249.md) Now,
who can fail to perceive that this is an occasion by itself, and that
the incident in connection with which Peter was incited to make the
presumptuous declaration already referred to is an entirely different
one? But, once more, Matthew presents us with the following passage:
“And when they had sung an hymn,” he says, “they went out into the Mount
of Olives. Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because
of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the
sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. But after I am risen
again, I will go before you into Galilee.” <span
id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250.md) The same passage is given in
precisely the same form by Mark. <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251.md) What similarity is there, however,
in these words, or in the ideas expressed by them, either to the terms
in which John represents Peter to have made his presumptuous
declaration, or to those in which Luke exhibits him as uttering such an
asseveration? And so we find that in Matthew’s narrative the connection
proceeds immediately thus: “Peter answered and said unto Him, Though all
men shall be offended because of Thee, yet will I never be offended.
<span id="page_179">p. 179</span> <span
id="vi.vi.iii-Page_179"></span>Jesus saith unto him, Verily, I say unto
thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Peter saith unto him, Though I should die with Thee, yet will I not deny
Thee. Likewise also said all His disciples.” <span
id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252.md)

<span id="vi.vi.iii-p13"></span>7. All this is recorded almost in the
same language also by Mark, only that he has not put in so general a
form what the Lord said with regard to the manner in which the event
\[of Peter’s failure\] was to be brought about, but has given it a more
particular turn. For his version is this: “Verily I say unto thee, That
this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt
deny me thrice.” <span id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253.md) Thus it
appears that all of them tell us how the Lord foretold that Peter would
deny Him before the cock crew, but that they do not all mention how
often the cock was to crow, and that Mark is the only one who has
presented a more explicit notice of this incident in the narrative.
Hence some are of opinion that Mark’s statement is not in harmony with
those of the others. But this is simply because they do not give
sufficient attention to the facts of the case, and, above all, because
they approach the question under the cloud of a prejudiced mind, in
consequence of their being possessed by a hostile disposition towards
the gospel. The fact is, that Peter’s denial, when taken as a whole, is
a threefold denial. For he remained in the same state of mental
agitation, and harboured the same mendacious intention, until what had
been foretold regarding him was brought to his mind, and healing came to
him by bitter weeping and sorrow of heart. It is evident, however, that
if this complete denial—that is to say, the threefold denial—is taken to
have commenced only after the first crowing of the cock, three of the
evangelists will appear to have given an incorrect account of the
matter. For Matthew’s version is this: “Verily I say unto thee, That
this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice;” and Luke
puts it thus: “I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day,
before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me;” and John
presents it in this form: “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, the cock
shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice.” And thus, in different
terms and with words introduced in diverse successions, these three
evangelists have expressed one and the same sense as conveyed by the
words which the Lord spake—namely, the fact that, before the cock should
crow, Peter was to deny Him thrice. On the other hand, if \[we suppose
that\] he went through the whole triple denial before the cock began to
crow at all, then Mark will be made to underlie the charge of having
given a superfluous statement when he puts these words into the Lord’s
mouth: “Verily I say unto thee, That this day, before the cock crow
twice, thou shall deny me thrice.” For to what purpose would it be to
say, “before the cock crow twice,” when, on the supposition that this
entire threefold denial was gone through previous to the first crowing
of the cock, it is self-evident that a negation, which would thus be
proved to have been completed before the first cockcrow, must also, as
matter of course, be understood to have been fully uttered before the
second cockcrow and before the third, and, in short, before all the
cockcrowings which took place on that same night? But, inasmuch as this
threefold denial was begun previous to the first crowing of the cock,
those three evangelists concerned themselves with noticing, not the time
at which Peter was to complete it, but the extent  <span
id="fr_1254"></span>[1255](#fn_1254.md) to which it was to be carried, and
the period at which it was to commence; that is to say, their object was
to bring out the facts that it was to be thrice repeated, and that it
was to begin previous to the cockcrowing. At the same time, so far as
the man’s own mind is concerned, we might also quite well understand it
to have been engaged in, as a whole, previous to the first cockcrow. For
although it is true that, so far as regards the actual utterance of the
individual who was guilty of the denial, that threefold negation was
only entered upon previous to the first cockcrow, and really finished
before the second cockcrow, still it is equally true that, in so far as
the disposition of mind and the apprehensions indulged by Peter were
concerned, it was conceived, <span id="fr_1255"></span>[1256](#fn_1255.md)
as a whole, before the first cockcrow. Neither is it a matter of any
consequence of what duration those intervals of delay were which elapsed
between the several utterances of that thrice-recurring voice, if it is
the case that the denial completely possessed his heart even previous to
the first cockcrow,—in consequence, indeed, of his having imbibed a
spirit of terror so abject as to make him capable of denying the Lord
when he was questioned regarding Him, not only once, but a second time,
and even a third time. Thus, a more correct and careful consideration of
the matter might show us <span id="fr_1256"></span>[1257](#fn_1256.md)
that, precisely as it is declared that the man who looketh on a woman to
lust after her has committed <span id="page_180">p. 180</span> <span
id="vi.vi.iii-Page_180"></span>adultery with her already in his
heart, <span id="fr_1257"></span>[1258](#fn_1257.md) so, in the present
instance, inasmuch as in the words which he spoke, Peter merely
expressed the apprehension which he had already conceived with such
intensity in his mind as to make it capable of enduring even on to a
third repetition of his denial of the Lord, this threefold negation is
to be assigned as a whole to that particular period at which the fear
that sufficed thus to carry him on to a threefold denial took possession
of him. In this way, too, it may be made apparent that, even if the
words in which the denial was couched began to break forth from him only
after the first cockcrow, when his heart was smitten by the inquiries
addressed to him, it would involve neither any absurdity nor any
untruthfulness, although it were said that before the cock crew he
denied Him thrice, seeing that, in any case, previous to the crowing of
the cock, his mind had been assailed by an apprehension violent enough
to be able to draw him <span id="fr_1258"></span>[1259](#fn_1258.md) on
even to a third denial. All the less, therefore, ought we to feel any
difficulty in the matter, if it appears that the threefold denial, as
expressed also in the thrice-recurring utterances of the person who made
the denial, was entered upon previous to the crowing of the cock,
although it was not completed before the first cockcrow. We may take a
parallel case, and suppose an intimation to be made to the following
effect to a person: “This night, before the cock crow, you will write a
letter to me, in which you will revile me thrice.” Well, surely in this
instance, if the man began to write the letter before the cock had
crowed at all, and finished it after the cock had crowed for the first
time, that would be no reason for alleging that the intimation
previously made was false. The fact, therefore, is that, in putting
these words into the Lord’s lips, “Before the cock crow twice, thou
shalt deny me thrice,” Mark has given us a plainer indication of the
intervals of time which separated the utterances themselves. And when we
come to the said section of the evangelical narrative, we shall see that
the circumstances are presented in a manner which exhibits, in that
connection also, the harmony subsisting among the evangelists.

<span id="vi.vi.iii-p20"></span>8. If, however, the demand is to get at
the very words, literally and completely, which the Lord addressed to
Peter, we answer that it is impossible to discover these; and further,
that it is simply superfluous to ask them, inasmuch as the speaker’s
meaning—to intimate which was the object He had in view in uttering the
words—admits of being understood with the utmost plainness, even under
the diverse terms employed by the evangelists. And whether, then, it be
the case that Peter, instigated at different occasions in the course of
the Lord’s sayings, made his presumptuous declaration three several
times, and had his denial foretold him thrice over by the Lord, as is
the more probable result to which our investigation points us; or
whether it may appear that the accounts given by all the evangelists are
capable of being reduced to a single statement, when a certain order of
narration is adopted, so that it could be proved that it was only on one
occasion that the Lord predicted to Peter, on the exhibition of his
presumptuous spirit, the fact that he would deny Him;—in either case,
any contradiction between the evangelists will fail to be detected, as
nothing of that nature really exists.
