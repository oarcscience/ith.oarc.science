<span id="vii.xliv-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.xliv-p2.1"></span>\[XCII. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.xliv-p3"></span>*On the same words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.xliv-p3.1"></span>*[Matt. xxii.
42](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042.md)<span id="vii.xliv-p3.2"></span>*

<span id="vii.xliv-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xliv-p4.1"></span>The</span> question which was proposed to the
Jews, Christians ought to solve. For the Lord Jesus Christ, who proposed
it to the Jews, did not solve it Himself, to the Jews, I mean, He did
not, but to us He hath solved it. I will put you in remembrance,
Beloved, and ye will find that He hath solved it. But first consider the
knot of the question. He asked the Jews what they “thought of Christ,
whose Son He was to be;” for they too look for the Christ. They read of
Him in the Prophets, they expected Him to come, when He was come they
killed Him; for where they read that Christ would come, there did they
read that they should kill Christ. But His future coming they hoped for
in the Prophets; for they did not see their future crime. He therefore
so questioned them about the Christ, not as if about One who was unknown
to them, or whose Name they had never heard, or whose coming they had
never hoped for. For they err in that even yet they hope for Him. And we
indeed hope for Him too; but we hope for Him as One who is to come as
Judge, not to be judged. For the Holy Prophets prophesied both, that He
should come first to be judged unrighteously, that He should come
afterwards to judge with righteousness. “What think ye,” then, saith he,
“of Christ? whose Son is He? They answered Him, The Son of David.” <span
id="fr_3073"></span>[3074](#fn_3073.md) And this was entirely according to
the Scriptures. But He said, “How then doth David in spirit call Him
Lord, saying, The Lord said unto My Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand,
till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. If David then in spirit call
Him Lord, how is He his Son?” <span id="fr_3074"></span>[3075](#fn_3074.md)

<span id="vii.xliv-p7"></span>2. Here then is need of a caution, lest
Christ be thought to have denied that He was the Son of David. He did
not deny that He was the Son of David, but He enquired the way. “Ye have
said that Christ is the Son of David, I do not deny it; but David calls
Him Lord; tell me how is He his Son, who is also his Lord; tell me how?”
They did not tell Him, but were silent. Let us then tell by the
explanation of Christ Himself. Where? By His Apostle. But first, whereby
do we prove that Christ hath Himself explained it? The Apostle says,
“Would ye receive a proof of Christ who <span id="page_401">p.
401</span> <span id="vii.xliv-Page_401"></span>speaketh in me?” <span
id="fr_3075"></span>[3076](#fn_3075.md) So then in the Apostle hath He
vouchsafed to solve this question. In the first place, what said Christ
speaking by the Apostle to Timothy? “Remember that Jesus Christ of the
seed of David was raised from the dead according to my Gospel.” <span
id="fr_3076"></span>[3077](#fn_3076.md) See, Christ is the Son of David.
How is He also David’s Lord? Tell us, O Apostle: “who being in the form
of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.” Acknowledge
David’s Lord. If thou acknowledge David’s Lord, our Lord, the Lord of
heaven and earth, the Lord of the Angels, equal with God, in the form of
God, how is He David’s Son? Mark what follows. The Apostle shows thee
David’s Lord by saying, “Who being in the form of God, thought it not
robbery to be equal with God.” And how is He David’s Son? “But He
emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the
likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled
Himself, having become obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him.” <span
id="fr_3077"></span>[3078](#fn_3077.md) Christ “of the seed of David,” the
Son of David, rose again because “He emptied Himself.” How did He “empty
Himself”? By taking that which He was not, not by losing that which He
was. He “emptied Himself,” He “humbled himself.” Though He was God, He
appeared as man. He was despised as He walked on earth, He who made the
heaven. He was despised as though a mere man, as though of no power.
Yea, not despised only, but slain moreover. He was that stone that lay
on the ground, the Jews stumbled against it, and were shaken. And what
doth He Himself say? “Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be
shaken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to
powder.” <span id="fr_3078"></span>[3079](#fn_3078.md) First, He lay low,
and they stumbled against Him; He shall come from above, and He will
“grind” them that have been shaken “to powder.”

<span id="vii.xliv-p12"></span>3. Thus have ye heard that Christ is both
David’s Son, and David’s Lord: David’s Lord always, David’s Son in time:
David’s Lord, born of the substance of His Father, David’s Son, born of
the Virgin Mary, conceived by the Holy Ghost. Let us hold fast both. The
one of them will be our eternal habitation, the other is our deliverance
from our present exile. For unless our Lord Jesus Christ had vouchsafed
to become man, man had perished. He was made that which He made, that
what He made might not perish. Very Man, Very God; God and man whole
Christ. This is the Catholic faith. Whoso denieth that Christ is God is
a Photinian; <span id="fr_3079"></span>[3080](#fn_3079.md) whoso denieth
that Christ is man is a Manichæan. <span
id="fr_3080"></span>[3081](#fn_3080.md) Whoso confesseth that Christ is God
equal with the Father and very man, that He truly suffered, truly shed
His blood (for the Truth would not have set us free, if He had given a
false price for us); whoso confesseth both, is a Catholic. He hath the
country, he hath the way. He hath the country, “In the beginning was the
Word;” <span id="fr_3081"></span>[3082](#fn_3081.md) He hath the country,
“Being in the form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal with
God.” <span id="fr_3082"></span>[3083](#fn_3082.md) He hath the way, “The
Word was made flesh;” <span id="fr_3083"></span>[3084](#fn_3083.md) He hath
the way, “He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant.” <span
id="fr_3084"></span>[3085](#fn_3084.md) He is the home whither we are
going, He is the way whereby we go. Let us by Him go unto Him, and we
shall not go astray.
