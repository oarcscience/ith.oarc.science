<span id="v.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.</span>

<span id="v.iii.vii-p2"></span>25. The fourth petition is, “Give us this
day our daily bread.” Daily bread is put either for all those things
which meet the wants of this life, in reference to which He says in His
teaching, “Take no thought for the morrow:” so that on this account
there is added, “Give us this day:” or, it is put for the sacrament of
the body of Christ, which we daily receive: or, for the spiritual food,
of which the same Lord says, “Labour for the meat which perisheth not;”
 <span id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) and again, “I am the bread of
life, <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) which came down from
heaven.” <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) But which of these
three views is the more probable, is a question for consideration. For
perhaps some one may wonder why we should pray that we may obtain the
things which are necessary for this life,—such, for instance, as food
and clothing,—when the Lord Himself says, “Be not anxious what ye shall
eat, or what ye shall put on.” Can any one not be anxious for a thing
which he prays that he may obtain; when prayer is to be offered with so
great earnestness of mind, that to this refers all that has been said
about shutting our <span id="page_42">p. 42</span> <span
id="v.iii.vii-Page_42"></span>closets, and also the command, “Seek ye
first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things
shall be added <span id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) unto you”?
Certainly He does not say, Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and then
seek those other things; but “all these things,” says He, “shall be
added unto you,” that is to say, even though ye are not seeking them.
But I know not whether it can be found out, how one is rightly said not
to seek what he most earnestly pleads with God that he may receive.

<span id="v.iii.vii-p7"></span>26. But with respect to the sacrament of
the Lord’s body (in order that they may not start a question, who, the
most of them being in Eastern parts, do not partake of the Lord’s supper
daily, while this bread is called daily bread: in order, therefore, that
they may be silent, and not defend their way of thinking about this
matter even by the very authority of the Church, because they do such
things without scandal, and are not prevented from doing them by those
who preside over their churches, and when they do not obey are not
condemned; whence it is proved that this is not understood as daily
bread in these parts: for, if this were the case, they would be charged
with the commission of a great sin, who do not on that account receive
it daily; but, as has been said, not to argue at all to any extent from
the case of such parties), this consideration at least ought to occur to
those who reflect, that we have received a rule for prayer from the
Lord, which we ought not to transgress, either by adding or omitting
anything. And since this is the case, who is there who would venture to
say that we ought only once to use the Lord’s Prayer, or at least that,
even if we have used it a second or a third time before the hour at
which we partake of the Lord’s body, afterwards we are assuredly not so
to pray during the remaining hours of the day? For we shall no longer be
able to say, “Give us this day,” respecting what we have already
received; or every one will be able to compel us to celebrate that
sacrament at the very last hour of the day.

<span id="v.iii.vii-p8"></span>27. It remains, therefore, that we should
understand the daily bread as spiritual, that is to say, divine
precepts, which we ought daily to meditate and to labour after. For just
with respect to these the Lord says, “Labour for the meat which
perisheth not.” That food, moreover, is called daily food at present, so
long as this temporal life is measured off by means of days that depart
and return. And, in truth, so long as the desire of the soul is directed
by turns, now to what is higher, now to what is lower, *i.e.* now to
spiritual things, now to carnal, as is the case with him who at one time
is nourished with food, at another time suffers hunger; bread is daily
necessary, in order that the hungry man may be recruited, and he who is
falling down may be raised up. As, therefore, our body in this life,
that is to say, before that great change, is recruited with food,
because it feels loss; so may the soul also, since by means of temporal
desires it sustains as it were a loss in its striving after God, be
reinvigorated by the food of the precepts. Moreover, it is said, “Give
us this day,” as long as it is called to-day, *i.e.* in this temporal
life. For we shall be so abundantly provided with spiritual food after
this life unto eternity, that it will not then be called daily bread;
because there the flight of time, which causes days to succeed days,
whence it may be called to-day, will not exist. But as it is said,
“To-day, if ye will hear His voice,” <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) which the apostle interprets in the
Epistle to the Hebrews, As long as it is called to-day; <span
id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) so here also the expression is to be
understood, “Give us this day.” But if any one wishes to understand the
sentence before us also of food necessary for the body, or of the
sacrament of the Lord’s body, we must take all three meanings
conjointly; that is to say, that we are to ask for all at once as daily
bread, both the bread necessary for the body, and the visible hallowed
bread, and the invisible bread of the word of God. <span

<span id="v.iii.vii-p11"></span> The Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.vii-p11.1"></span> ἐπιούσιος</span>, translated *daily* (see
margin of Revised Version, with alternate rendering of American
Committee), is found only here and in [Luke
11.3](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#003.md)<span
id="v.iii.vii-p11.2"></span>. Its meaning does not seem to come under
the review of Augustin, but has troubled modern commentators. It has
been taken to mean (1) *needful*, hence sufficient, as opposed to
superfluity or want (Chrysostom, Tholuck, Ewald, Ebrard, Weiss, etc.);
(2) *daily* (Luther, English version, etc.); (3) *for the coming day*
(Grotius, Meyer, Thayer, Lightfoot, who has an elaborate treatment in
*Revision of English New Testament*, Append. pp. 195–245). The direct
reference of the bread to spiritual food is given by the Vulgate, and
generally accepted in the Roman-Catholic Church. Olshausen, Delitzsch,
Alford, etc., regard the spiritual nourishment involved by implication
in the term.
