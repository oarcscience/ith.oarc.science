<span id="vii.ii.xlv-p1"></span> §45. *Thus once again every part of
creation manifests the glory of God. Nature, the witness to her Creator,
yields (by miracles) a second testimony to God Incarnate. The witness of
Nature, perverted by man’s sin, was thus forced back to truth. If these
reasons suffice not, let the Greeks look at facts.*

<span id="vii.ii.xlv-p2"></span>Consistently, therefore, the Word of God
took a body and has made use of a human instrument, in order to quicken
the body also, and as He is known in creation by His works so to work in
man as well, and to shew Himself everywhere, leaving nothing void of His
own divinity, and of the knowledge of Him. 2. For I resume, and repeat
what I said before, that the Saviour did this in order that, as He fills
all things on all sides by His presence, so also He might fill all
things with the knowledge of Him, as the divine Scripture also
says <span id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) : “The whole earth was
filled with the knowledge of the Lord.” 3. For if a man will but look up
to heaven, he sees its Order, or if he cannot raise his face to heaven,
but only to man, he sees His power, beyond comparison with that of men,
shewn by His works, and learns that He alone among men is God the Word.
Or if a man is gone astray among demons, and is in fear of them, he may
see this man drive them out, and make up his mind that He is their
Master. Or if a man has sunk to the waters <span
id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md) , and thinks that they are God,—as the
Egyptians, for instance, reverence the water,—he may see its nature
changed by Him, and learn that the Lord is Creator of the waters. 4. But
if a man is gone down even to Hades, and stands in awe of the heroes who
have descended thither, regarding them as gods, yet he may see the fact
of Christ’s Resurrection and victory over death, and infer that among
them also Christ alone is true God and Lord. 5. For the Lord touched all
parts of creation, and freed and undeceived all of them from every
illusion; as Paul says: “Having <span id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md)
put off from Himself the principalities and the powers, He triumphed on
the Cross:” that no one might by any possibility be any longer deceived,
but everywhere might find the true Word of God. 6. For thus man, shut in
on every side <span id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md) , and beholding
the divinity of the Word unfolded everywhere, that is, in heaven, in
Hades, in man, upon earth, is no longer exposed to deceit concerning
God, but is to worship Christ alone, and through Him come rightly to
know the Father. 7. By these arguments, then, on grounds of reason, the
Gentiles in their turn will fairly be put to shame by us. But if they
deem the arguments insufficient to shame them, let them be assured of
what we are saying at any rate by facts obvious to the sight of all.
