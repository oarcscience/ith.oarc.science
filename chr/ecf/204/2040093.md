<span id="vi.ii.iii.xii"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iii.xii-p1"></span> §46. *Doctrine of Scripture on the
subject of Part 3*.

<span id="vi.ii.iii.xii-p2"></span>Has then the divine teaching, which
abolished the godlessness of the heathen or the idols, passed over in
silence, and left the race of mankind to go entirely unprovided with the
knowledge of God? Not so: rather it anticipates their understanding when
it says <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178) : “Hear, O Israel, the
Lord thy God is one God;” and again, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart and with all thy strength;” and again, “Thou shalt
worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve, and shalt
cleave to Him.” 2. But that the providence and ordering power of the
Word also, over all and toward all, is attested by all inspired
Scripture, this passage suffices to confirm our argument, where men who
speak of God say <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179) : “Thou hast
laid the foundation of the earth and it abideth. The day continueth
according to Thine ordinance.” And again <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180) : “Sing to our God upon the harp, that
covereth the heaven with clouds, that prepareth rain for the earth, that
bringeth forth grass upon the mountains, and green herb for the service
of man, and giveth food to the cattle.” 3. But by whom does He give it,
save by Him through Whom all things were made? For the providence over
all things belongs naturally to Him by Whom they were made; and who is
this save the Word of God, concerning Whom in another psalm <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181) he says: “By the Word of the Lord were
the heavens made, and all the host of them by the Breath of His mouth.”
For He tells us that all things were made in Him and through Him. 4.
Wherefore He also persuades us and says <span
id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182) , <span id="page_29">p. 29</span>
<span id="vi.ii.iii.xii-Page_29"></span>“He spake and they were made, He
commanded and they were created;” as the illustrious Moses also at the
beginning of his account of Creation confirms what we say by his
narrative <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183) , saying: and God
said, “let us make man in our image and after our likeness:” for also
when He was carrying out the creation of the heaven and earth and all
things, the Father said to Him <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184) ,
“Let the heaven be made,” and “let the waters be gathered together and
let the dry land appear,” and “let the earth bring forth herb” and
“every green thing:” so that one must convict Jews also of not genuinely
attending to the Scriptures. 5. For one might ask them to whom was God
speaking, to use the imperative mood? If He were commanding and
addressing the things He was creating, the utterance would be redundant,
for they were not yet in being, but were about to be made; but no one
speaks to what does not exist, nor addresses to what is not yet made a
command to be made. For if God were giving a command to the things that
were to be, He must have said, “Be made, heaven, and be made, earth, and
come forth, green herb, and be created, O man.” But in fact He did not
do so; but He gives the command thus: “Let us make man,” and “let the
green herb come forth.” By which God is proved to be speaking about them
to some one at hand: it follows then that some one was with Him to Whom
He spoke when He made all things. 6. Who then could it be, save His
Word? For to whom could God be said to speak, except His Word? Or who
was with Him when He made all created Existence, except His Wisdom,
which says <span id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185) : “When He was making
the heaven and the earth I was present with Him?” But in the mention of
heaven and earth, all created things in heaven and earth are included as
well. 7. But being present with Him as His Wisdom and His Word, looking
at the Father He fashioned the Universe, and organised it and gave it
order; and, as He is the power of the Father, He gave all things
strength to be, as the Saviour says <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186) : “What things soever I see the Father
doing, I also do in like manner.” And His holy disciples teach that all
things were made “through Him and unto Him;” 8. and, being the good
Offspring of Him that is good, and true Son, He is the Father’s Power
and Wisdom and Word, not being so by participation <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187) , nor as if these qualifies were
imparted to Him from without, as they are to those who partake of Him
and are made wise by Him, and receive power and reason in Him; but He is
the very Wisdom, very Word, and very own Power of the Father, very
Light, very Truth, very Righteousness, very Virtue, and in truth His
express Image, and Brightness, and Resemblance. And to sum all up, He is
the wholly perfect Fruit of the Father, and is alone the Son, and
unchanging Image of the Father.
