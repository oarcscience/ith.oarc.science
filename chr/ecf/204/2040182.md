<span id="xii.ii.vi-p1"></span> §6. *All the above illegalities were
carried on in the interest of Arianism.*

<span id="xii.ii.vi-p2"></span>Gregory then is an Arian, and has been
sent to the Arian party; for none demanded him, but they only; and
accordingly as a hireling and a stranger, he makes use of the Governor
to inflict these dreadful and cruel deeds upon the people of the
Catholic Churches, as not being his own. For since Pistus, whom Eusebius
and his fellows formerly appointed over the Arians, was justly
anathematized <span id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467) and excommunicated
for his impiety by you the Bishops of the Catholic Church, as you all
know, on our writing to you concerning him, they have now, therefore, in
like manner sent this Gregory to them; and lest they should a second
time be put to shame, by our again writing against them, they have
employed extraneous force against me, in order that, having obtained
possession of the Churches, they may seem to have escaped all suspicion
of being Arians. But in this too they have been mistaken, for none of
the people of the Church are with them, except the heretics <span
id="page_96">p. 96</span> <span id="xii.ii.vi-Page_96"></span>only, and
those who have been excommunicated on divers charges, and such as have
been compelled by the Governor to dissemble. This then is the drama of
Eusebius and his fellows, which they have long been rehearsing and
composing; and now have succeeded in performing through the false
charges which they have made against me before the Emperor <span
id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468) . Notwithstanding, they are not yet
content to be quiet, but even now seek to kill me; and they make
themselves so formidable to our friends, that they are all driven into
banishment, and expect death at their hands. But you must not for this
stand in awe of their iniquity, but on the contrary avenge: and shew
your indignation at this their unprecedented conduct against us. For if
when one member suffers all the members suffer with it, and, according
to the blessed Apostle, we ought to weep with them that weep <span
id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469) , let every one, now that so great a
Church as this is suffering, avenge its wrongs, as though he were
himself a sufferer. For we have a common Saviour, who is blasphemed by
them, and Canons belonging to us all, which they are transgressing. If
while any of you had been sitting in your Church, and while the people
were assembled with you, without any blame, some one had suddenly come
under plea of an edict as successor of one of you, and had acted the
same part towards you, would you not have been indignant? would you not
have demanded to be righted? If so, then it is right that you should be
indignant now, lest if these things be passed over unnoticed, the same
mischief shall by degrees extend itself to every Church, and so our
schools of religion be turned into a market-house and an exchange.
