<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ii-p2"></span>11 (*continued*). <span
class="c10"><span id="xxi.ii.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> same is the
meaning of the passage in the Acts which they also allege, that in which
Peter says, that ‘He hath made both Lord and Christ that same Jesus whom
ye have crucified.’ For here too it is not written, ‘He made for Himself
a Son,’ or ‘He made Himself a Word,’ that they should have such notions.
If then it has not escaped their memory, that they speak concerning the
Son of God, let them make search whether it is anywhere written, ‘God
made Himself a Son,’ or ‘He created for Himself a Word;’ or again,
whether it is anywhere written in plain terms, ‘The Word is a work or
creation;’ and then let them proceed to make their case, the insensate
men, that here too they may receive their answer. But if they can
produce nothing of the kind, and only catch at such stray expressions as
‘He made’ and ‘He has been made,’ I fear lest, from hearing, ‘In the
beginning God made the heaven and the earth,’ and ‘He made the sun and
the moon,’ and ‘He made the sea,’ they should come in time to call the
Word the heaven, and the Light which took place on the first day, and
the earth, and each particular thing that has been made, so as to end in
resembling the Stoics, as they are called, the one drawing out their God
into all things <span id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271.md) , the other
ranking God’s Word with each work in particular; which they have well
nigh done already, saying that He is one of His works.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ii-p4"></span>12. But here they must have the same
answer as before, and first be told that the Word is a Son, as has been
said above <span id="fr_2272"></span>[2273](#fn_2272.md) , and not a work,
and that such terms are not to be understood of His Godhead, but the
reason and manner of them investigated. To persons who so inquire, the
human Economy will plainly present itself, which He undertook for our
sake. For Peter, after saying, ‘He hath made Lord and Christ,’
straightway added, ‘this Jesus whom ye crucified;’ which makes it plain
to any one, even, if so be, to them, provided they attend to the
context, that not the Essence of the Word, but He according to His
manhood is said to have been made. For what was crucified but the body?
and how could be signified what was bodily in the Word, except by saying
‘He made?’ Especially has that phrase, ‘He made,’ a meaning consistent
with orthodoxy; in that he has not said, as I observed before, ‘He made
Him Word,’ but ‘He made Him Lord,’ nor that in general terms <span
id="fr_2273"></span>[2274](#fn_2273.md) , but ‘towards’ us, and ‘in the
midst of’ us, as much as to say, ‘He manifested Him.’ And this Peter
himself, when he began this primary teaching, carefully <span
id="fr_2274"></span>[2275](#fn_2274.md) expressed, when he said to them,
‘Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man manifested
of God towards you by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by
Him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves know <span
id="fr_2275"></span>[2276](#fn_2275.md) .’ Consequently the term which he
uses in the end, ‘made’, this He has explained in the beginning by
‘manifested,’ for by the signs and wonders which the Lord did, He was
manifested to be not merely man, but God in a body and Lord also, the
Christ. Such also is the passage in the Gospel according to John,
‘Therefore the more did the Jews persecute Him, because He not only
broke the Sabbath, but said also that God was His own Father, making
Himself <span id="page_355">p. 355</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ii-Page_355"></span>equal with God <span
id="fr_2276"></span>[2277](#fn_2276.md) .’ For the Lord did not then
fashion Himself to be God, nor indeed is a made God conceivable, but He
manifested it by the works, saying, ‘Though ye believe not Me, believe
My works, that ye may know that I am in the Father, and the Father in
Me <span id="fr_2277"></span>[2278](#fn_2277.md) .’ Thus then the Father
has ‘made’ Him Lord and King in the midst of us, and towards us who were
once disobedient; and it is plain that He who is now displayed as Lord
and King, does not then begin to be King and Lord, but begins to shew
His Lordship, and to extend it even over the disobedient.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ii-p11"></span>13. If then they suppose that the
Saviour was not Lord and King, even before He became man and endured the
Cross, but then began to be Lord, let them know that they are openly
reviving the statements of the Samosatene. But if, as we have quoted and
declared above, He is Lord and King everlasting, seeing that Abraham
worships Him as Lord, and Moses says, ‘Then the Lord rained upon Sodom
and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven <span
id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278.md) ;’ and David in the Psalms, ‘The
Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand <span
id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279.md) ;’ and, ‘Thy Throne, O God, is for
ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy
Kingdom <span id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280.md) ;’ and, ‘Thy Kingdom
is an everlasting Kingdom <span id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281.md) ;’
it is plain that even before He became man, He was King and Lord
everlasting, being Image and Word of the Father. And the Word being
everlasting Lord and King, it is very plain again that Peter said not
that the Essence of the Son was made, but spoke of His Lordship over us,
which ‘became’ when He became man, and, redeeming all by the Cross,
became Lord of all and King. But if they continue the argument on the
ground of its being written, ‘He made,’ not willing that ‘He made’
should be taken in the sense of ‘He manifested,’ either from want of
apprehension, or from their Christ-opposing purpose, let them attend to
another sound exposition of Peter’s words. For he who becomes Lord of
others, comes into the possession of beings already in existence; but if
the Lord is Framer of all and everlasting King, and when He became man,
then gained possession of us, here too is a way in which Peter’s
language evidently does not signify that the Essence of the Word is a
work, but the after-subjection of all things, and the Saviour’s Lordship
which came to be over all. And this coincides with what we said
before <span id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282.md) ; for as we then
introduced the words, ‘Become my God and defence,’ and ‘the Lord became
a refuge for the oppressed <span id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283.md) ,’
and it stood to reason that these expressions do not shew that God is
originate, but that His beneficence ‘becomes’ towards each individual,
the same sense has the expression of Peter also.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ii-p18"></span>14. For the Son of God indeed, being
Himself the Word, is Lord of all; but we once were subject from the
first to the slavery of corruption and the curse of the Law, then by
degrees fashioning for ourselves things that were not, we served, as
says the blessed Apostle, ‘them which by nature are no Gods <span
id="fr_2284"></span>[2285](#fn_2284.md) ,’ and, ignorant of the true God,
we preferred things that were not to the truth; but afterwards, as the
ancient people when oppressed in Egypt groaned, so, when we too had the
Law ‘engrafted <span id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285.md) ’ in us, and
according to the unutterable sighings <span
id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286.md) of the Spirit made our
intercession, ‘O Lord our God, take possession of us <span
id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md) ,’ then, as ‘He became for a house
of refuge’ and a ‘God and defence,’ so also He became our Lord. Nor did
He then begin to be, but we began to have Him for our Lord. For upon
this, God being good and Father of the Lord, in pity, and desiring to be
known by all, makes His own Son put on Him a human body and become man,
and be called Jesus, that in this body offering Himself for all, He
might deliver all from false worship and corruption, and might Himself
become of all Lord and King. His becoming therefore in this way Lord and
King, this it is that Peter means by, ‘He hath made Him Lord,’ and ‘hath
sent Christ;’ as much as to say, that the Father in making Him man (for
to be made belongs to man), did not simply make Him man, but has made
Him in order to His being Lord of all men, and to His hallowing all
through the Anointing. For though the Word existing in the form of God
took a servant’s form, yet the assumption of the flesh did not make a
servant <span id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288.md) of the Word, who was
by nature Lord; but rather, not only was it that emancipation of all
humanity which takes place by the Word, but that very Word who was by
nature Lord, and was then made man, hath by means of a servant’s form
been made Lord of all and Christ, that is, in order to hallow all by the
Spirit. And as God, when ‘becoming a God and defence,’ and saying, ‘I
will be a God to them,’ does not then become God more than before, nor
then begins to become God, but, what He ever is, that He then becomes to
those who need Him, when it <span id="page_356">p. 356</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ii-Page_356"></span>pleaseth Him, so Christ also being by
nature Lord and King everlasting, does not become Lord more than He was
at the time He is sent forth, nor then begins to be Lord and King, but
what He is ever, that He then is made according to the flesh; and,
having redeemed all, He becomes thereby again Lord of quick and dead.
For Him henceforth do all things serve, and this is David’s meaning in
the Psalm, ‘The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, until
I make Thine enemies Thy footstool <span
id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289.md) .’ For it was fitting that the
redemption should take place through none other than Him who is the Lord
by nature, lest, though created by the Son, we should name another Lord,
and fall into the Arian and Greek folly, serving the creature beyond the
all-creating God <span id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290.md) .

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ii-p26"></span>15. This, at least according to my
nothingness, is the meaning of this passage; moreover, a true and a good
meaning have these words of Peter as regards the Jews. For Jews, astray
from the truth, expect indeed the Christ as coming, but do not reckon
that He undergoes a passion, saying what they understand not; ‘We know
that, when the Christ cometh, He abideth for ever, and how sayest Thou,
that He must be lifted up <span id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291.md) ?’
Next they suppose Him, not the Word coming in flesh, but a mere man, as
were all the kings. The Lord then, admonishing Cleopas and the other,
taught them that the Christ must first suffer; and the rest of the Jews
that God was come among them, saying, ‘If He called them gods to whom
the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken, say ye of Him
whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou
blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God <span
id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292.md) ?’

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ii-p29"></span>16. Peter then, having learned this
from the Saviour, in both points set the Jews right, saying, “O Jews,
the divine Scriptures announce that Christ cometh, and you consider Him
a mere man as one of David’s descendants, whereas what is written of Him
shews Him to be not such as you say, but rather announces Him as Lord
and God, and immortal, and dispenser of life. For Moses has said, ‘Ye
shall see your Life hanging before your eyes <span
id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293.md) .’ And David in the hundred and
ninth Psalm, ‘The Lord said unto My Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand,
till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool <span
id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294.md) ;’ and in the fifteenth, ‘Thou
shalt not leave my soul in hades, neither shalt Thou suffer Thy Holy One
to see corruption <span id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295.md) .’ Now that
these passages have not David for their scope he himself witnesses,
avowing that He who was coming was His own Lord. Nay you yourselves know
that He is dead, and His remains are with you. That the Christ then must
be such as the Scriptures say, you will plainly confess yourselves. For
those announcements come from God, and in them falsehood cannot be. If
then ye can state that such a one has come before, and can prove him God
from the signs and wonders which he did, ye have reason for maintaining
the contest, but if ye are not able to prove His coming, but are
expecting such an one still, recognise the true season from Daniel, for
his words relate to the present time. But if this present season be that
which was of old, afore-announced, and ye have seen what has taken place
among us, be sure that this Jesus, whom ye crucified, this is the
expected Christ. For David and all the Prophets died, and the sepulchres
of all are with you, but that Resurrection which has now taken place,
has shewn that the scope of these passages is Jesus. For the crucifixion
is denoted by ‘Ye shall see your Life hanging,’ and the wound in the
side by the spear answers to ‘He was led as a sheep to the
slaughter <span id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296.md) ,’ and the
resurrection, nay more, the rising of the ancient dead from out their
sepulchres (for these most of you have seen), this is, ‘Thou shalt not
leave My soul in hades,’ and ‘He swallowed up death in strength <span
id="fr_2297"></span>[2298](#fn_2297.md) ,’ and again, ‘God will wipe away.’
For the signs which actually took place shew that He who was in a body
was God, and also the Life and Lord of death. For it became the Christ,
when giving life to others, Himself not to be detained by death; but
this could not have happened, had He, as you suppose, been a mere man.
But in truth He is the Son of God, for men are all subject to death. Let
no one therefore doubt, but the whole house of Israel know assuredly
that this Jesus, whom ye saw in shape a man, doing signs and such works,
as no one ever yet had done, is Himself the Christ and Lord of all. For
though made man, and called <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ii-p34.2"></span>Jesus</span>, as we said before, He
received no loss by that human passion, but rather, in being made man,
He is manifested as Lord of quick and dead. For since, as the Apostle
said, ‘in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased
God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe <span
id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298.md) .’ And so, since we men would not
acknowledge God through His Word, nor serve the Word of God our <span
id="page_357">p. 357</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ii-Page_357"></span>natural Master, it pleased God to
shew in man His own Lordship, and so to draw all men to Himself. But to
do this by a mere man beseemed not <span
id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299.md) ; lest, having man for our Lord, we
should become worshippers of man <span
id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300.md) . Therefore the Word Himself became
flesh, and the Father called His Name Jesus, and so ‘made’ Him Lord and
Christ, as much as to say, ‘He made Him to rule and to reign;’ that
while in the Name of Jesus, whom ye crucified, every knee bows, we may
acknowledge as Lord and King both the Son and through Him the Father.”

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ii-p38"></span>17. The Jews then, most of
them <span id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301.md) , hearing this, came to
themselves and forthwith acknowledged the Christ, as it is written in
the Acts. But, the Ario-maniacs on the contrary choose to remain Jews,
and to contend with Peter; so let us proceed to place before them some
parallel phrases; perhaps it may have some effect upon them, to find
what the usage is of divine Scripture. Now that Christ is everlasting
Lord and King, has become plain by what has gone before, nor is there a
man to doubt about it; for being Son of God, He must be like Him <span
id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302.md) , and being like, He is certainly
both Lord and King, for He says Himself, ‘He that hath seen Me, hath
seen the Father.’ On the other hand, that Peter’s mere words, ‘He hath
made Him both Lord and Christ,’ do not imply the Son to be a creature,
may be seen from Isaac’s blessing, though this illustration is but a
faint one for our subject. Now he said to Jacob, ‘Become thou lord over
thy brother;’ and to Esau, ‘Behold, I have made him thy lord <span
id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303.md) .’ Now though the word ‘made’ had
implied Jacob’s essence and the coming into being, even then it would
not be right in them as much as to imagine the same of the Word of God,
for the Son of God is no creature as Jacob was; besides, they might
inquire and so rid themselves of that extravagance. But if they do not
understand it of his essence nor of his coming into being, though Jacob
was by nature creature and work, is not their madness worse than the
Devil’s <span id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304.md) , if what they dare
not ascribe in consequence of a like phrase even to things by nature
originate, that they attach to the Son of God, saying that He is a
creature? For Isaac said ‘Become’ and ‘I have made,’ signifying neither
the coming into being nor the essence of Jacob (for after thirty years
and more from his birth he said this); but his authority over his
brother, which came to pass subsequently.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ii-p43"></span>18. Much more then did Peter say
this without meaning that the Essence of the Word was a work; for he
knew Him to be God’s Son, confessing, ‘Thou art the Christ, the Son of
the Living God <span id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305.md) ;’ but he
meant His Kingdom and Lordship which was formed and came to be according
to grace, and was relatively to us. For while saying this, he was not
silent about the Son of God’s everlasting Godhead which is the Father’s;
but He had said already, that He had poured the Spirit on us; now to
give the Spirit with authority, is not in the power of creature or work,
but the Spirit is God’s Gift <span id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306.md)
. For the creatures are hallowed by the Holy Spirit; but the Son, in
that He is not hallowed by the Spirit, but on the contrary Himself the
Giver of it to all <span id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307.md) , is
therefore no creature, but true Son of the Father. And yet He who gives
the Spirit, the same is said also to be made; that is, to be made among
us Lord because of His manhood, while giving the Spirit because He is
God’s Word. For He ever was and is, as Son, so also Lord and Sovereign
of all, being like in all things <span
id="fr_2308"></span>[2309](#fn_2308.md) to the Father, and having all that
is the Father’s <span id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309.md) as He Himself
has said <span id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310.md) .

[Next: Chapter XVI.--Introductory to Proverbs viii. 22, that the Son is
not a Creature. Arian formula, a creature but not as one of the
creatures; but each creature is unlike all other creatures; and no
creature can create. The Word then differs from all creatures in that in
which they, though otherwise differing, all agree together, as
creatures; viz. in being an efficient cause; in being the one medium or
instrumental agent in creation; moreover in being the revealer of the
Father; and in being the object of worship.](2040363.md)
