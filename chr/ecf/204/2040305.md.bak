<span id="xix.ii.ii-p1"></span> 2. *Insincerity of this charge.*

<span id="xix.ii.ii-p2"></span>But forasmuch as they pretend to charge
me with cowardice, it is necessary that I should write somewhat
concerning this, whereby it shall be proved that they are men of wicked
minds, who have not read the sacred Scriptures: or if they have read
them, that they do not believe the divine inspiration of the oracles
they contain. For had they believed this, they would not dare to act
contrary to them, nor imitate the malice of the Jews who slew the Lord.
For God having given them a commandment, ‘Honour thy father and thy
mother,’ and, ‘He that curseth father or mother, let him die the
death <span id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392.md) ;’ that people
established a contrary law, changing the honour into dishonour, and
alienating to other uses the money which was due from the children to
their parents. And though they had read what David did, they acted in
contradiction to his example, and accused the guiltless for plucking the
ears of corn, and rubbing them in their hands on the Sabbath day <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393.md) . Not that they cared either for
the laws, or for the Sabbath, for they were guilty of greater
transgressions of the law on that day: but being wicked-minded, they
grudged the disciples the way of salvation, and desired that their own
private notions should have the sole pre-eminence. They however have
received the reward of their iniquity, having ceased to be an holy
nation, and being counted henceforth as the rulers of Sodom, and as the
people of Gomorrah <span id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394.md) . And
these men likewise, not less than they, seem to me to have received
their punishment already in their ignorance of their own folly. For they
understand not what they say, but think that they know things of which
they are ignorant; while the only knowledge that is in them is to do
evil, and to frame devices more and more wicked day by day. Thus they
reproach us with our present flight, not for the sake of virtue, as
wishing us to shew manliness by coming forward (how is it possible that
such a wish can be entertained by enemies in behalf of those who run not
with them in the same career of madness?); but being full of malice,
they pretend this, and buzz <span id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395.md)
all around that such is the case, thinking, foolish as indeed they are,
that through fear of their revilings, we shall yet be induced to give
ourselves up to them. For this is what they desire: to accomplish this
they have recourse to all kinds of schemes: they pretend themselves to
be friends, while they search as enemies, to the end that they may glut
themselves with our blood, and put us also out of the way, because we
have always opposed and do still oppose their impiety, and confute and
brand their heresy.
