<span id="vii.ii.xxii-p1"></span> §22. *But why did He not withdraw His
body from the Jews, and so guard its immortality? (1) It became Him not
to inflict death on Himself, and yet not to shun it. (2) He came to
receive death as the due of others, therefore it should come to Him from
without. (3) His death must be certain, to guarantee the truth of His
Resurrection. Also, He could not die from infirmity, lest He should be
mocked in His healing of others.*

<span id="vii.ii.xxii-p2"></span>But it were better, one might say, to
have hidden from the designs of the Jews, that He might guard His body
altogether from death. Now let such an one be told that this too was
unbefitting the Lord. For as it was not fitting for the Word of God,
being the Life, to inflict death Himself on His own body, so neither was
it suitable to fly from death offered by others, but rather to follow it
up unto destruction, for which reason He naturally neither laid aside
His body of His own accord, nor, again, fled from the Jews when they
took counsel against Him. 2. But this did not shew weakness on the
Word’s part, but, on the contrary, shewed Him to be Saviour and Life; in
that He both awaited death to destroy it, and hasted to accomplish the
death offered Him for the salvation of all. 3. And besides, the Saviour
came to accomplish not His own death, but the death of men; whence He
did not lay aside His body by a death of His own <span
id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) —for He was Life and had none—but
received that death which came from men, in order perfectly to do away
with this when it met Him in His own body. 4. Again, from the following
also one might see the reasonableness of the Lord’s body meeting this
end. The Lord was especially concerned for the resurrection of the body
which He was set to accomplish. For what He was to do was to manifest it
as a monument of victory over death, and to assure all of His having
effected the blotting out of corruption, and of the incorruption of
their bodies from thenceforward; as a gage of which and a proof of the
resurrection in store for all, He has preserved His own body incorrupt.
5. If, then, once more, His body had fallen sick, and the word had been
sundered from it in the sight of all, it would have been unbecoming that
He who healed the diseases of others should suffer His own instrument to
waste in sickness. For how could His driving out the diseases of others
have been believed <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) in if His own
temple fell sick in Him <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) ? For
either He had been mocked as unable to drive away diseases, or if He
could, but did not, He would be thought insensible toward others also.
