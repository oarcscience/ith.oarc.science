<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Letter LIX</span>.—*To Epictetus.*

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p2"></span>To my Lord, beloved brother, and
most-longed-for fellow-minister Epictetus <span
id="fr_4699"></span>[4700](#fn_4699.md) , Athanasius greeting in the Lord.
I thought that all vain talk of all heretics, many as they may be, had
been stopped by the Synod which was held at Nicæa. For the Faith there
confessed by the Fathers according to the divine Scriptures is enough by
itself at once to overthrow all impiety, and to establish the religious
belief in Christ. For this reason at the present time, at the assembling
of diverse synods, both in Gaul and Spain, and great Rome <span
id="fr_4700"></span>[4701](#fn_4700.md) , all who came together, as though
moved by one spirit, unanimously anathematised those who still were
secretly holding with Arius, namely Auxentius of Milan, Ursacius,
Valens, and Gaius of Pannonia. And they wrote everywhere, that, whereas
the above-said were devising the names of synods to cite on their side,
no synod should be cited in the Catholic Church save only that which was
held at Nicæa, which was a monument of victory over all heresy, but
especially the Arian, which was the main reason of the synod assembling
when it did. How then, after all this, are some attempting to raise
doubts or questions? If they belong to the Arians, this is not to be
wondered at, that they find fault with what was drawn up against
themselves, just as the Gentiles when they hear that ‘the idols of the
heathen are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands <span
id="fr_4701"></span>[4702](#fn_4701.md) ,’ think the doctrine of the divine
Cross folly. But if those who desire to reopen everything by raising
questions belong to those who think they believe aright, and love what
the fathers have declared, they are simply doing what the prophet
describes, giving their neighbour turbid confusion to drink <span
id="fr_4702"></span>[4703](#fn_4702.md) , and fighting about words to no
good purpose, save to the subversion of the simple.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p7"></span>2. I write this after reading the
memoranda submitted by your piety, which I could wish had not been
written at all, so that not even any record of these things should go
down to posterity. For who ever yet heard the like? Who ever taught or
learned it? For ‘from Sion shall come forth the law of God, and the word
of the Lord from Jerusalem <span id="fr_4703"></span>[4704](#fn_4703.md) ;’
but whence came forth this? What lower region has vomited the statement
that the Body born of Mary is coessential with the Godhead of the Word?
or that the Word has been changed into flesh, bones, hair, and the whole
body, and altered from its own nature? Or who ever heard in a Church, or
even from Christians, that the Lord wore a body putatively, not in
nature; or who ever went so far in impiety as to say and hold, that this
Godhead, which is coessential with the Father, was circumcised and
became imperfect instead of perfect; and that what hung upon the tree
was not the body, but the very creative Essence and Wisdom? Or who that
hears that the Word transformed for Himself a passible body, not of
Mary, but of His own Essence, could call him who said this a Christian?
Or who devised this abominable impiety, for it to enter even his
imagina<span id="page_571">p. 571</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-Page_571"></span>tion, and for him to say that to
pronounce the Lord’s Body to be of Mary is to hold a Tetrad instead of a
Triad in the Godhead? Those who think thus, saying that the Body of the
Saviour which He put on from Mary, is of the Essence of the Triad. Or
whence again have certain vomited an impiety as great as those already
mentioned; saying namely, that the body is not newer than the Godhead of
the Word, but was coeternal with it always, since it was compounded of
the Essence of Wisdom. Or how did men called Christians venture even to
doubt whether the Lord, Who proceeded from Mary, while Son of God by
Essence and Nature, is of the seed of David according to the flesh <span
id="fr_4704"></span>[4705](#fn_4704.md) , and of the flesh of the Holy
Mary? Or who have been so venturesome as to say that Christ Who suffered
in the flesh and was crucified is not Lord, Saviour, God, and Son of the
Father <span id="fr_4705"></span>[4706](#fn_4705.md) ? Or how can they wish
to be called Christians who say that the Word has descended upon a holy
man as upon one of the prophets, and has not Himself become man, taking
the body from Mary; but that Christ is one person, while the Word of
God, Who before Mary and before the ages was Son of the Father, is
another? Or how can they be Christians who say that the Son is one, and
the Word of God another?

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p11"></span>3. Such were the contents of the
memoranda; diverse statements, but one in their sense and in their
meaning; tending to impiety. It was for these things that men who make
their boast in the confession of the fathers drawn up at Nicæa were
disputing and quarrelling with one another. But I marvel that your piety
suffered it, and that you did not stop those who said such things, and
propound to them the right faith, so that upon hearing it they might
hold their peace, or if they opposed it might be counted as heretics.
For the statements are not fit for Christians to make or to hear, on the
contrary they are in every way alien from the Apostolic teaching. For
this reason, as I said above, I have caused what they say to be baldly
inserted in my letter, so that one who merely hears may perceive the
shame and impiety therein contained. And although it would be right to
denounce and expose in full the folly of those who have had such ideas,
yet it would be a good thing to close my letter here and write no more.
For what is so manifestly shewn to be evil, it is not necessary to waste
time in exposing further, lest contentious persons think the matter
doubtful. It is enough merely to answer such things as follows: we are
content with the fact that this is not the teaching of the Catholic
Church, nor did the fathers hold this. But lest the ‘inventors of evil
things <span id="fr_4706"></span>[4707](#fn_4706.md) ’ make entire silence
on our part a pretext for shamelessness, it will be well to mention a
few points from Holy Scripture, in case they may even thus be put to
shame, and cease from these foul devices.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p13"></span>4. Whence did it occur to you,
sirs, to say that the Body is of one Essence with the Godhead of the
Word? For it is well to begin at this point, in order that by shewing
this opinion to be unsound, all the others too may be proved to be the
same. Now from the divine Scriptures we discover nothing of the kind.
For they say that God came in a human body. But the fathers who also
assembled at Nicæa say that, not the body, but the Son Himself is
coessential with the Father, and that while He is of the Essence of the
Father, the body, as they admitted according to the Scriptures, is of
Mary. Either then deny the Synod of Nicæa, and as heretics bring in your
doctrine from the side; or, if you wish to be children of the fathers,
do not hold the contrary of what they wrote. For here again you may see
how monstrous it is: If the Word is coessential with the body which is
of earthly nature, while the Word is, by your own confession,
coessential with the Father, it will follow that even the Father Himself
is coessential with the body produced from the earth. And why any longer
blame the Arians for calling the Son a creature, when you go off to
another form of impiety, saying that the Word was changed into flesh and
bones and hair and muscles and all the body, and was altered from its
own nature? For it is time for you to say openly that He was born of
earth; for from earth is the nature of the bones and of all the body.
What then is this great folly of yours, that you fight even with one
another? For in saying that the Word is coessential with the Body, you
distinguish the one from the other <span
id="fr_4707"></span>[4708](#fn_4707.md) , while in saying that He has been
changed into flesh, you imagine a change of the Word Himself. And who
will tolerate you any longer if you so much as utter these opinions? For
you have gone further in impiety than any heresy. For if the Word is
coessential with the Body, the commemoration and the work of Mary are
superfluous <span id="fr_4708"></span>[4709](#fn_4708.md) , inasmuch as the
body could have existed before Mary, just as the Word also is eternal:
if, that is, it is as you say co-essential with the Body. Or what need
was there even of the Word coming among us, to put on what was
coessential with Himself, <span id="page_572">p. 572</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-Page_572"></span>or to change His own nature and
become a body? For the Deity does not take hold <span
id="fr_4709"></span>[4710](#fn_4709.md) of itself, so as to put on what is
of its own Essence, any more than the Word sinned, in that it ransoms
the sins of others, in order that changing into a body it should offer
itself a sacrifice for itself, and ransom itself.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p17"></span>5. But this is not so, far be the
thought. For he ‘takes hold of the seed of Abraham <span
id="fr_4710"></span>[4711](#fn_4710.md) ,’ as the apostle said; whence it
behoved Him to be made like His brethren in all things, and to take a
Body like us. This is why Mary is truly presupposed, in order that He
may take it from her, and offer it for us as His own. And this Isaiah
pointed to in his prophecy, in the words: ‘Behold the Virgin <span
id="fr_4711"></span>[4712](#fn_4711.md) ,’ while Gabriel is sent to her—not
simply to a virgin, but ‘to a virgin betrothed to a man <span
id="fr_4712"></span>[4713](#fn_4712.md) ,’ in order that by means of the
betrothed man he might shew that Mary was really a human being. And for
this reason Scripture also mentions her bringing forth, and tells of her
wrapping Him in swaddling clothes; and therefore, too, the paps which He
sucked were called blessed <span id="fr_4713"></span>[4714](#fn_4713.md) .
And He was offered as a sacrifice, in that He Who was born had opened
the womb <span id="fr_4714"></span>[4715](#fn_4714.md) . Now all these
things are proofs that the Virgin brought forth. And Gabriel preached
the Gospel to her without uncertainty, saying not merely ‘what is born
in thee,’ lest the body should be thought to be extraneously induced
upon her, but ‘of thee,’ that what was born might be believed to be
naturally from her, inasmuch as Nature clearly shews that it is
impossible for a virgin to produce milk unless she has brought forth,
and impossible for a body to be nourished with milk and wrapped in
swaddling clothes unless it has previously been naturally brought forth.
This is the meaning of His being circumcised on the eighth day: of
Symeon taking Him in his arms, of His becoming a young child, and
growing when He was twelve years old, and of His coming to His thirtieth
year. For it was not, as some suppose, the very Essence of the Word that
was changed, and was circumcised, because it is incapable of alteration
or change. For the Saviour Himself says, ‘Behold, behold, it is I, and I
change not <span id="fr_4715"></span>[4716](#fn_4715.md) ,’ while Paul
writes: ‘Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and to-day, and for
ever <span id="fr_4716"></span>[4717](#fn_4716.md) .’ But in the Body which
was circumcised, and carried, and ate and drank, and was weary, and was
nailed on the tree and suffered, there was the impassible and
incorporeal Word of God. This Body it was that was laid in a grave, when
the Word had left it, yet was not parted from it, to preach, as Peter
says, also to the spirits in prison <span
id="fr_4717"></span>[4718](#fn_4717.md) .

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p26"></span>6. And this above all shews the
foolishness of those who say that the Word was changed into bones and
flesh. For if this had been so, there were no need of a tomb. For the
Body would have gone by itself to preach to the spirits in Hades. But as
it was, He Himself went to preach, while the Body Joseph wrapped in a
linen cloth, and laid it away at Golgotha <span
id="fr_4718"></span>[4719](#fn_4718.md) . And so it is shewn to all that
the Body was not the Word, but Body of the Word. And it was this that
Thomas handled when it had risen from the dead, and saw in it the print
of the nails, which the Word Himself had undergone, seeing them fixed in
His own Body, and though able to prevent it, did not do so. On the
contrary, the incorporeal Word made His own the properties of the Body,
as being His own Body. Why, when the Body was struck by the attendant,
as suffering Himself He asked, ‘Why smitest thou Me <span
id="fr_4719"></span>[4720](#fn_4719.md) ?’ And being by nature intangible,
the Word yet said, ‘I gave My back to the stripes, and My cheeks to
blows, and hid not My face from shame and spitting <span
id="fr_4720"></span>[4721](#fn_4720.md) .’ For what the human Body of the
Word suffered, this the Word, dwelling in the body, ascribed to Himself,
in order that we might be enabled to be partakers of the Godhead of the
Word <span id="fr_4721"></span>[4722](#fn_4721.md) . And verily it is
strange that He it was Who suffered and yet suffered not. Suffered,
because His own Body suffered, and He was in it, which thus suffered;
suffered not, because the Word, being by Nature God, is impassible. And
while He, the incorporeal, was in the passible Body, the Body had in it
the impassible Word, which was destroying the infirmities inherent in
the Body. But this He did, and so it was, in order that Himself taking
what was ours and offering it as a sacrifice, He might do away with it,
and conversely might invest us with what was His, and cause the Apostle
to say: ‘This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal put
on immortality <span id="fr_4722"></span>[4723](#fn_4722.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p32"></span>7. Now this did not come to pass
putatively, as some have supposed: far be the thought: but the Saviour
having in very truth become Man, the salvation of the whole man was
brought about. For if the Word were in the Body putatively, as they say,
and by putative is meant imaginary, it follows that both the salvation
and the resurrection of man is apparent only, as the most impious
Manichæus held. But truly our salvation is not merely apparent, nor does
it extend to the body only, but the whole man, body and soul alike, has
truly <span id="page_573">p. 573</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-Page_573"></span>obtained salvation in the Word
Himself. That then which was born of Mary was according to the divine
Scriptures human by nature, and the Body of the Lord was a true one; but
it was this, because it was the same as our body, for Mary was our
sister inasmuch as we all are from Adam. And no one can doubt of this
when he remembers what Luke wrote. For after He had risen from the dead,
when some thought that they did not see the Lord in the body derived
from Mary, but were beholding a spirit instead, He said, ‘See My hands
and My feet, and the prints of the nails, that it is I Myself: handle Me
and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see Me to have. And
when He had said thus, He shewed them His hands and His feet <span
id="fr_4723"></span>[4724](#fn_4723.md) .’ Whence they can be refuted who
have ventured to say that the Lord was transformed into flesh and bones.
For He did not say, ‘As ye see Me to be flesh and bone,’ but ‘as ye see
Me to have,’ in order that it might not be thought that the Word Himself
was changed into these things, but that He might be believed to have
them after His resurrection as well as before His death.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p34"></span>8. These things being thus
demonstrated, it is superfluous to touch upon the other points, or to
enter upon any discussion relating to them, since the body in which the
Word was is not coessential with the Godhead, but was truly born of
Mary, while the Word Himself was not changed into bones and flesh, but
came in the flesh. For what John said, ‘The Word was made flesh <span
id="fr_4724"></span>[4725](#fn_4724.md) ,’ has this meaning, as we may see
by a similar passage; for it is written in Paul: ‘Christ has become a
curse for us <span id="fr_4725"></span>[4726](#fn_4725.md) .’ And just as
He has not Himself become a curse, but is said to have done so because
He took upon Him the curse on our behalf, so also He has become flesh
not by being changed into flesh, but because He assumed on our behalf
living flesh, and has become Man. For to say ‘the Word became flesh,’ is
equivalent to saying ‘the Word has become man;’ according to what is
said in Joel: ‘I will pour forth of My Spirit upon all flesh <span
id="fr_4726"></span>[4727](#fn_4726.md) ;’ for the promise did not extend
to the irrational animals, but is for men, on whose account the Lord is
become Man. As then this is the sense of the above text, they all will
reasonably condemn themselves who have thought that the flesh derived
from Mary existed before her, and that the Word, prior to her, had a
human soul, and existed in it always even before His coming. And they
too will cease who have said that the Flesh was not accessible to death,
but belonged to the immortal Nature. For if it did not die, how could
Paul deliver to the Corinthians ‘that Christ died for our sins,
according to the Scriptures <span id="fr_4727"></span>[4728](#fn_4727.md)
,’ or how did He rise at all if He did not also die? Again, they will
blush deeply who have even entertained the possibility of a Tetrad
instead of a Triad resulting, if it were said that the Body was derived
from Mary. For if (they argue) we say the Body is of one Essence with
the Word, the Triad remains a Triad; for then the Word imports no
foreign element into it; but if we admit that the Body derived from Mary
is human, it follows, since the Body is foreign in Essence, and the Word
is in it, that the addition of the Body causes a Tetrad instead of a
Triad.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p39"></span>9. When they argue thus, they fail
to perceive the contradiction in which they involve themselves. For even
though they say that the Body is not from Mary, but is coessential with
the Word, yet none the less (the very point they dissemble, to avoid
being credited with their real opinion) this on their own premises can
be proved to involve a Tetrad. For as the Son, according to the Fathers,
is coessential with the Father, but is not the Father Himself, but is
called coessential, as Son with Father, so the Body, which they call
coessential with the Word, is not the Word Himself, but a distinct
entity. But if so, on their own shewing, their Triad will be a
Tetrad <span id="fr_4728"></span>[4729](#fn_4728.md) . For the true, really
perfect and indivisible Triad is not accessible to addition as is the
Triad imagined by these persons. And how do these remain Christians who
imagine another God in addition to the true one? For, once again, in
their other fallacy one can see how great is their folly. For if they
think because it is contained and stated in the Scriptures, that the
Body of the Saviour is human and derived from Mary, that a Tetrad is
substituted for a Triad, as though the Body created an addition, they go
very far wrong, so much so as to make the creature equal to the Creator,
and suppose that the Godhead can receive an addition. And they have
failed to perceive that the Word is become Flesh, not by reason of an
addition to the Godhead, but in order that the flesh may rise again. Nor
did the Word proceed from Mary that He might be bettered, but that He
might ransom the human race. How then can they think that the Body,
ransomed and quickened by the Word, made an addition in respect of
Godhead to the Word that had quickened it? For on the contrary, a great
addition has accrued to the human Body itself from the fellowship and
<span id="page_574">p. 574</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-Page_574"></span>union of the Word with it. For
instead of mortal it is become immortal; and, though an animal <span
id="fr_4729"></span>[4730](#fn_4729.md) body, it is become spiritual, and
though made from earth it entered the heavenly gates. The Triad, then,
although the Word took a body from Mary, is a Triad, being inaccessible
to addition or diminution; but it is always perfect, and in the Triad
one Godhead is recognised, and so in the Church one God is preached, the
Father of the Word.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p42"></span>10. For this reason they also will
henceforth keep silence, who once said that He who proceeded from Mary
is not very Christ, or Lord, or God. For if He were not God in the Body,
how came He, upon proceeding from Mary, straightway to be called
‘Emmanuel, which is being interpreted God with us <span
id="fr_4730"></span>[4731](#fn_4730.md) ?’ Why again, if the Word was not
in the flesh, did Paul write to the Romans ‘of whom is Christ after the
flesh, Who is above all God blessed for ever. Amen <span
id="fr_4731"></span>[4732](#fn_4731.md) ?’ Let them therefore confess, even
they who previously denied that the Crucified was God, that they have
erred; for the divine Scriptures bid them, and especially Thomas, who,
after seeing upon Him the print of the nails, cried out ‘My Lord and my
God <span id="fr_4732"></span>[4733](#fn_4732.md) !’ For the Son, being
God, and Lord of glory <span id="fr_4733"></span>[4734](#fn_4733.md) , was
in the Body which was ingloriously nailed and dishonoured; but the Body,
while it suffered, being pierced on the tree, and water and blood flowed
from its side, yet because it was a temple of the Word was filled full
of the Godhead. For this reason it was that the sun, seeing its creator
suffering in His outraged body, withdrew its rays and darkened the
earth. But the body itself being of mortal nature, beyond its own nature
rose again by reason of the Word which was in it; and it has ceased from
natural corruption, and, having put on the Word which is above man, has
become incorruptible.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p47"></span>11. But with regard to the
imagination of some, who say that the Word came upon one particular man,
the Son of Mary, just as it came upon each of the Prophets, it is
superfluous to discuss it, since their madness carries its own
condemnation manifestly with it. For if He came thus, why was that man
born of a virgin, and not like others of a man and woman? For in this
way each of the saints also was begotten. Or why, if the Word came thus,
is not the death of each one said to have taken place on our behalf, but
only this man’s death? Or why, if the Word sojourned among us in the
case of each one of the prophets, is it said only in the case of Him
born of Mary that He sojourned here ‘once at the consummation of the
ages <span id="fr_4734"></span>[4735](#fn_4734.md) ?’ Or why, if He came as
He had come in the saints of former times, did the Son of Mary alone,
while all the rest had died without rising as yet, rise again on the
third day? Or why, if the Word had come in like manner as He had done in
the other cases, is the Son of Mary alone called Emmanuel, as though a
Body filled full of the Godhead were born of her? For Emmanuel is
interpreted ‘God with us.’ Or why, if He came thus, is it not said that
when each of the saints ate, drank, laboured, and died, that He (the
Word) ate, drank, laboured, and died, but only in the case of the Son of
Mary. For what that Body suffered is said to have been suffered by the
Word. And while we are merely told of the others that they were born,
and begotten, it is said in the case of the Son of Mary alone that ‘The
Word was made Flesh.’

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p49"></span>12. This proves that while to all
the others the Word came, in order that they might prophesy, from Mary
the Word Himself took flesh, and proceeded forth as man; being by nature
and essence the Word of God, but after the flesh man of the seed of
David, and made of the flesh of Mary, as Paul said <span
id="fr_4735"></span>[4736](#fn_4735.md) . Him the Father pointed out both
in Jordan and on the Mount, saying, ‘This is My beloved Son in whom I am
well pleased <span id="fr_4736"></span>[4737](#fn_4736.md) .’ Him the
Arians denied, but we recognising worship, not dividing the Son and the
Word, but knowing that the Son is the Word Himself, by Whom all things
are made, and by Whom we were redeemed. And for this reason we wonder
how any contention at all has arisen among you about things so clear.
But thanks to the Lord, much as we were grieved at reading your
memoranda, we were equally glad at their conclusion. For they departed
with concord, and peacefully agreed in the confession of the pious and
orthodox faith. This fact has induced me, after much previous
consideration, to write these few words; for I am anxious lest by my
silence this matter should cause pain rather than joy to those whose
concord occasions joy to ourselves. I therefore ask your piety in the
first place, and secondly those who hear, to take my letter in good
part, and if anything is lacking in it in respect of piety, to set that
right, and inform me. But if it is written, as from one unpractised in
speech, below the subject and imperfectly, let all allow for my
feebleness in speaking. Greet all the brethren with you. All those with
us greet you; may you live in good health in the Lord, beloved and truly
longed for.

<span id="fn_4699"></span>[570:4700](2040456.htm#fr_4699.md) <span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p3"></span> Of Epictetus, bishop of Corinth,
nothing else is known. This letter reflects the uncertainty, which
attended the victory of the Nicene Creed, as to the relation of the
Historical Christ to the Eternal Son. The questions raised at Corinth
were those which troubled the Eastern Church generally, and which came
to a head in the system of Apollinarius, whose distinctive tenet,
however, is not mentioned in this letter. Persons anxious to place the
Nicene doctrine in intelligible connection with the matter of the Gospel
Narrative had debated the question before Epictetus, and with deference
to his ruling. Their tentative solutions (§2 *infr.*) fall into two
classes, both of which, in attempting to solve the problem, proceed upon
the assumption incidentally combated by Athan., that the Manhood of
Christ was a Hypostasis or Person, which if invested with Divine
attributes, would introduce a fourth hypostatic entity into the Trinity.
To avoid this, one class identified the Logos and the <span
class="Greek"><span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p3.2"></span>῎</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p3.3"></span>Ανθρωπος</span>,
either by assuming that the Logos was changed into flesh, or that the
flesh was itself non-natural and of the Divine Essence. The other class
excluded the Man Jesus from the Trinity, explaining His relation to God
on the lines of Photinus or the later Nestorians. Both alternatives are
already glanced at (*supr.* p. 485) by the Council of 362. In the
present case, both classes of suggestions seem to have been made
tentatively and *bona fide* (§12). The letter must have been written
before the two books against Apollinarianism, which (if genuine) fall
about 372. Its more exact date depends on the identification of the
Councils referred to in §1 (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xiv-p3.5"></span>νῦν γενομένων</span>), and is therefore
very doubtful. At any rate Apollinarianism proper is not alluded to, and
Apollinarius is said to have expressed to Serapion of Thmuis his high
opinion of our Letter (see *Letter* 54, note 1). It was much quoted in
the Christological controversies of the next 80 years, e.g. by the
Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon, by Theodoret, Cyril, and Leo the
Great (see Migne xxvi. 1050; Bright, *Later Treatises,* pp. 43 *sq.*,
and D.C.B. s.v. <span class="c10"><span
