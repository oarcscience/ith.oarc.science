<span id="xix.ii.xii-p1"></span> 12. *The Lord an example of timely
flight.*

<span id="xix.ii.xii-p2"></span>Wherefore also the Word Himself, being
made man for our sakes, condescended to hide Himself when He was sought
after, as we do: and also when He was persecuted, to flee and avoid the
designs of His enemies. For it became Him, as by hunger and thirst and
suffering, so also by hiding Himself and fleeing, to shew that He had
taken our flesh, and was made man. Thus at the very first, as soon as He
became man, when He was a little child, He Himself by His Angel
commanded Joseph, ‘Arise, and take the young Child and His Mother, and
flee into Egypt; for Herod will seek the young Child’s life <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435) .’ And when Herod was dead, we find
Him withdrawing to Nazareth by reason of Archelaus his son. And when
afterwards He was shewing Himself to be God, and made whole the withered
hand, the Pharisees went out, and held a council against Him, how they
might destroy Him; but when Jesus knew it, He withdrew Himself from
thence <span id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436) . So also when He
raised Lazarus from the dead, ‘from that day forth,’ says the Scripture,
‘they took counsel for to put Him to death. Jesus therefore walked no
more openly among the Jews; but went thence into the country near to the
wilderness <span id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437) .’ Again, when our
Saviour said, ‘Before Abraham was, I am,’ ‘the Jews took up stones to
cast at Him; but Jesus hid Himself, and went out of the temple <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438) .’ And ‘going through the midst of
them, He went His way,’ and ‘so passed by <span
id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439) .’
