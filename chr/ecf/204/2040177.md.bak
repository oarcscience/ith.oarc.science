<span id="xii.ii.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xii.ii.i-p3"></span>To his fellow-ministers in every place,
beloved lords, Athanasius sends health in the Lord.

<span id="xii.ii.i-p4"></span>§1. *The whole Church affected by what has
occurred.*

<span id="xii.ii.i-p5"></span>Our sufferings have been dreadful beyond
endurance, and it is impossible to describe them in suitable terms; but
in order that the dreadful nature of the events which have taken place
may be more readily apprehended, I have thought it good to remind you of
a history out of the Scriptures. It happened that a certain Levite <span
id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md) was injured in the person of his wife;
and, when he considered the exceeding greatness of the pollution (for
the woman was a Hebrew, and of the tribe of Judah), being astounded at
the outrage which had been committed against him, he divided his wife’s
body, as the Holy Scripture relates in the Book of Judges, and sent a
part of it to every tribe in Israel, in order that it might be
understood that an injury like this pertained not to himself only, but
extended to all alike; and that, if the people sympathised with him in
his sufferings, they might avenge him; or if they neglected to do so,
might bear the disgrace of being considered thenceforth as themselves
guilty of the wrong. The messengers whom he sent related what had
happened; and they that heard and saw it, declared that such things had
never been done from the day that the children of Israel came up out of
Egypt. So every tribe of Israel was moved, and all came together against
the offenders, as though they had themselves been the sufferers; and at
last the perpetrators of this iniquity were destroyed in war, and became
a curse in the mouths of all: for the assembled people considered not
their kindred blood, but regarded only the crime they had committed. You
know the history, brethren, and the particular account of the
circumstances given in Scripture. I will not therefore describe them
more in detail, since I write to persons acquainted with them, and as I
am anxious to represent to your piety our present circumstances, which
are even worse than those to which I have referred. For my object in
reminding you of this history is this, that you may compare those
ancient transactions with what has happened to us now, and perceiving
how much these last exceed the other in cruelty, may be filled with
greater indignation on account of them, than were the people of old
against those offenders. For the treatment we have undergone surpasses
the bitterness of any persecution; and the calamity of the Levite was
but small, when compared with the enormities which have now been
committed against the Church; or rather such deeds as these were never
before heard of in the whole world, or the like experienced by any one.
For in that case it was but a single woman that was injured, and one
Levite who suffered wrong; now the whole Church is injured, the
priesthood insulted, and worst of all, piety <span
id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) is persecuted by impiety. On that
occasion the tribes were astounded, each at the sight of part of the
body of one woman; but now the members of the whole Church are seen
divided from one another, and are sent abroad some to you, and some to
others, bringing word of the insults and injustice which they have
suffered. Be ye therefore also moved, I beseech you, considering that
these wrongs are done unto you no less than unto us; and let every one
lend his aid, as feeling that he is himself a sufferer, lest shortly
ecclesiastical Canons, and the faith of the Church be corrupted. For
both are in danger, unless God shall speedily by your hands amend what
has been done amiss, and the Church be avenged on her enemies. For our
Canons <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) and our forms were not
given to the Churches at the present day, but were wisely and safely
transmitted to us from our forefathers. Neither had our faith its
beginning at this time, but <span id="page_93">p. 93</span> <span
id="xii.ii.i-Page_93"></span>it came down to us from the Lord through
His disciples <span id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md) . That therefore
the ordinances which have been preserved in the Churches from old time
until now, may not be lost in our days, and the trust which has been
committed to us required at our hands; rouse yourselves, brethren, as
being stewards of the mysteries of God <span
id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md) , and seeing them now seized upon by
others. Further particulars of our condition you will learn from the
bearers of our letters; but I was anxious myself to write you a brief
account thereof, that you may know for certain, that such things have
never before been committed against the Church, from the day that our
Saviour when He was taken up, gave command to His disciples, saying, ‘Go
ye and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost <span
id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md) .’
