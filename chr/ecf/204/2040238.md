<span id="xvi.ii.xxvii-p1"></span> 65. And many monks have related with
the greatest agreement and unanimity that many other such like things
were done by him. But still these do not seem as marvellous as certain
other things appear to be. For once, when about to eat, having risen up
to pray about the ninth hour, he perceived that he was caught up in the
spirit, and, wonderful to tell, he stood and saw himself, as it were,
from outside himself, and that he was led in the air by certain ones.
Next certain bitter and terrible beings stood in the air and wished to
hinder him from passing through. But when his conductors opposed them,
they demanded whether he was not accountable to them. And when they
wished to sum up the account from his birth, Antony’s conductors stopped
them, saying, ‘The Lord hath wiped out the sins from his birth, but from
the time he became a monk, and devoted himself to God, it is permitted
you to make a reckoning.’ Then when they accused him and could not
convict him, his way was free and unhindered. And immediately he saw
himself, as it were, coming and standing by himself, and again he was
Antony as before. Then forgetful of eating, he remained the rest of the
day and through the whole of the night groaning and praying. For he was
astonished when he saw against what mighty opponents our wrestling is,
and by what labours we have to pass through the air. And he remembered
that this is what the Apostle said, ‘according to the prince of the
power of the air <span id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107.md) .’ For in it
the enemy hath power to fight and to attempt to hinder those who pass
through. Wherefore most earnestly he exhorted, ‘Take up the whole armour
of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108.md) ,’ that the enemy, ‘having no evil
thing to say against us, may be ashamed <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109.md) .’ And we who have learned this,
let us be mindful of the Apostle when he says, ‘whether in the body I
know not, or whether out of the body I know not; God knoweth <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110.md) .’ But Paul was caught up unto the
third heaven, and having heard things unspeakable he came down; while
Antony saw that he had come to the air, and contended until he was free.
