<span id="vi.ii.iii.vi-p1"></span> §40. *The rationality and order of
the Universe proves that it is the work of the Reason or Word of God*.

<span id="vi.ii.iii.vi-p2"></span>Who then might this Maker be? for this
is a point most necessary to make plain, lest, from ignorance with
regard to him, a man should suppose the wrong maker, and fall once more
into the same old godless error, but I think no one is really in doubt
about it. For if our argument has proved that the gods of the poets are
no gods, and has convicted of error those that deify creation, and in
general has shewn that the idolatry of the heathen is godlessness and
impiety, it strictly follows from the elimination of these that the true
religion is with us, and that the God we worship and preach is the only
true One, Who is Lord of Creation and Maker of all existence. 2. Who
then is this, save the Father of Christ, most holy and above all created
existence <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) , Who like an
excellent pilot, by His own Wisdom and His own Word, our Lord and
Saviour Christ, steers and preserves and orders all things, and does as
seems to Him best? But that is best which has been done, and which we
see taking place, since that is what He wills; and this a man can hardly
refuse to believe. 3. For if the movement of creation were irrational,
and the universe were borne along without plan, a man might fairly
disbelieve what we say. But if it subsist in reason and wisdom and
skill, and is perfectly ordered throughout, it follows that He that is
over it and has ordered it is none other than the \[reason or\] Word of
God. 4. But by Word I mean, not that which is involved and inherent in
all things created, which some are wont to call the seminal <span
id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) principle, which is without soul and
has no power of reason or thought, but only works by external art,
according to the skill of him that applies it,—nor such a word as
belongs to rational beings and which consists of syllables, and has the
air as its vehicle of expression,—but I mean the living and powerful
Word of the good God, the God of the Universe, the very Word which is
God <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) , Who while different from
things that are made, and from all Creation, is the One own Word of the
good Father, Who by His own providence ordered and illumines this
Universe. 5. For being the good Word of the Good Father He produced the
order of all things, combining one with another things contrary, and
reducing them to one harmonious order. He being the Power of God and
Wisdom of God causes the heaven to revolve, and has suspended the earth,
and made it fast, though resting upon nothing, by His own nod <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) . Illumined by Him, the sun gives
light to the world, and the moon has her measured period of shining. By
reason of Him the water is suspended in the clouds; the rains shower
upon the earth, and the sea is <span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span
id="vi.ii.iii.vi-Page_26"></span>kept within bounds, while the earth
bears grasses and is clothed with all manner of plants. 6. And if a man
were incredulously to ask, as regards what we are saying, if there be a
Word of God at all <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) , such an one
would indeed be mad to doubt concerning the Word of God, but yet
demonstration is possible from what is seen, because all things subsist
by the Word and Wisdom of God, nor would any created thing have had a
fixed existence had it not been made by reason, and that reason the Word
of God, as we have said.
