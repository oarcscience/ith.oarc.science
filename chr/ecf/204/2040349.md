<span id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—<span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p1.2"></span>That the Son is Eternal and
Increate</span>. *These attributes, being the points in dispute, are
first proved by direct texts of Scripture. Concerning the ‘eternal
power’ of God in* <span id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p1.3"></span>*[Rom. i.
20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md)<span id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p1.4"></span>,
which is shewn to mean the Son. Remarks on the Arian formula, ‘Once the
Son was not,’ its supporters not daring to speak of ‘a time when the Son
was not.’*

<span id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p2"></span>11. <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p2.1"></span>At</span> his suggestion then ye have
maintained and ye think, that ‘there was once when the Son was not;’
this is the first cloke of your views of doctrine which has to be
stripped off. Say then what was once when the Son was not, O slanderous
and irreligious men <span id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880.md) ? If ye
say the Father, your blasphemy is but greater; for it is impious to say
that He was ‘once,’ or to signify Him by the word ‘once.’ For He is
ever, and is now, and as the Son is, so is He, and is Himself He that
is, and Father of the Son. But if ye say that the Son was once, when He
Himself was not, the answer is foolish and unmeaning. For how could He
both be and not be? In this difficulty, you can but answer, that there
was a time when the Word was not; for your very adverb ‘once’ naturally
signifies this. And your other, ‘The Son was not before His generation,’
is equivalent to saying, ‘There was once when He was not,’ for both the
one and the other signify that there is a time before the Word. Whence
then this your discovery? Why do ye, as ‘the heathen, rage, and imagine
vain phrases against the Lord <span id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881.md)
and against His Christ?’ for no holy Scripture has used such language of
the Saviour, but rather ‘always’ and ‘eternal’ and ‘coexistent always
with the Father.’ For, ‘In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
with God, and the Word was God <span
id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882.md) .’ And in the Apocalypse he thus
speaks <span id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883.md) ; ‘Who is and who was
and who is to come.’ Now who can rob ‘who is’ and ‘who was’ of eternity?
This too in confutation of the Jews hath Paul written in his Epistle to
the Romans, ‘Of whom as concerning the flesh is Christ, who is over all,
God blessed for ever <span id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884.md) ;’ while
silencing the Greeks, he has said, ‘The visible things of Him from the
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things
that are made, even His eternal Power and Godhead <span
id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885.md) ;’ and what the Power of God is, he
teaches us elsewhere himself, ‘Christ the Power of God and the Wisdom of
God <span id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886.md) .’ Surely in these words
he does not designate the Father, as ye often whisper one to another,
affirming that the Father is ‘His eternal power.’ This is not so; for he
says not, ‘God Himself is the power,’ but ‘His is the power.’ Very plain
is it to all that ‘His’ is not ‘He;’ yet not something alien but rather
proper to Him. Study too the context and ‘turn to the Lord;’ now ‘the
Lord is that Spirit <span id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887.md) ;’and you
will see that it is the Son who is signified.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p11"></span><span id="page_313">p. 313</span>
<span id="xxi.ii.i.iv-Page_313"></span>12. For after making mention of
the creation, he naturally speaks of the Framer’s Power as seen in it,
which Power, I say, is the Word of God, by whom all things have been
made. If indeed the creation is sufficient of itself alone, without the
Son, to make God known, see that you fall not, from thinking that
without the Son it has come to be. But if through the Son it has come to
be, and ‘in Him all things consist <span
id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888.md) ,’ it must follow that he who
contemplates the creation rightly, is contemplating also the Word who
framed it, and through Him begins to apprehend the Father <span
id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889.md) . And if, as the Saviour also says,
‘No one knoweth the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son shall
reveal Him <span id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890.md) ,’ and if on
Philip’s asking, ‘Shew us the Father,’ He said not, ‘Behold the
creation,’ but, ‘He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father <span
id="fr_1891"></span>[1892](#fn_1891.md) ,’ reasonably doth Paul,—while
accusing the Greeks of contemplating the harmony and order of the
creation without reflecting on the Framing Word within it (for the
creatures witness to their own Framer) so as through the creation to
apprehend the true God, and abandon their worship of it,—reasonably hath
he said, ‘His Eternal Power and Godhead <span
id="fr_1892"></span>[1893](#fn_1892.md) ,’ thereby signifying the Son. And
where the sacred writers say, ‘Who exists before the ages,’ and ‘By whom
He made the ages <span id="fr_1893"></span>[1894](#fn_1893.md) ,’ they
thereby as clearly preach the eternal and everlasting being of the Son,
even while they are designating God Himself. Thus, if Isaiah says, ‘The
Everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth <span
id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894.md) ;’ and Susanna said, ‘O Everlasting
God <span id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895.md) ;’ and Baruch wrote, ‘I
will cry unto the Everlasting in my days,’ and shortly after, ‘My hope
is in the Everlasting, that He will save you, and joy is come unto me
from the Holy One <span id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896.md) ;’ yet
forasmuch as the Apostle, writing to the Hebrews, says, ‘Who being the
radiance of His glory and the Expression of His Person <span
id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897.md) ;’ and David too in the
eighty-ninth Psalm, ‘And the brightness of the Lord be upon us,’ and,
‘In Thy Light shall we see Light <span
id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898.md) ,’ who has so little sense as to
doubt of the eternity of the Son <span
id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899.md) ? for when did man see light
without the brightness of its radiance, that he may say of the Son,
‘There was once, when He was not,’ or ‘Before His generation He was
not.’ And the words addressed to the Son in the hundred and forty-fourth
Psalm, ‘Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages <span
id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900.md) ,’ forbid any one to imagine any
interval at all in which the Word did not exist. For if every interval
in the ages is measured, and of all the ages the Word is King and Maker,
therefore, whereas no interval at all exists prior to Him <span
id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901.md) , it were madness to say, ‘There
was once when the Everlasting was not,’ and ‘From nothing is the Son.’
And whereas the Lord Himself says, ‘I am the Truth <span
id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902.md) ,’ not ‘I became the Truth;’ but
always, ‘I am,—I am the Shepherd,—I am the Light,’—and again, ‘Call ye
Me not, Lord and Master? and ye call Me well, for so I am,’ who, hearing
such language from God, and the Wisdom, and Word of the Father, speaking
of Himself, will any longer hesitate about the truth, and not forthwith
believe that in the phrase ‘I am,’ is signified that the Son is eternal
and without beginning?

<span id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p27"></span>13. It is plain then from the above
that the Scriptures declare the Son’s eternity; it is equally plain from
what follows that the Arian phrases ‘He was not,’ and ‘before’ and
‘when,’ are in the same Scriptures predicated of creatures. Moses, for
instance, in his account of the generation of our system, says, ‘And
every plant of the field, before it was in the earth, and every herb of
the field before it grew; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain
upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground <span
id="fr_1903"></span>[1904](#fn_1903.md) .’ And in Deuteronomy, ‘When the
Most High divided to the nations <span
id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904.md) .’ And the Lord said in His own
Person, ‘If ye loved Me, ye would rejoice <span id="page_314">p.
314</span> <span id="xxi.ii.i.iv-Page_314"></span>because I said, I go
unto the Father, for My Father is greater than I. And now I have told
you before it come to pass, that when it is come to pass, ye might
believe <span id="fr_1905"></span>[1906](#fn_1905.md) .’ And concerning the
creation He says by Solomon, ‘Or ever the earth was, when there were no
depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with
water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, was I
brought forth <span id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906.md) .’ And, ‘Before
Abraham was, I am <span id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907.md) .’ And
concerning Jeremiah He says, ‘Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew
thee <span id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908.md) .’ And David in the
Psalm says, ‘Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth
and the world were made, Thou art, God from everlasting and world
without end <span id="fr_1909"></span>[1910](#fn_1909.md) .’ And in Daniel,
‘Susanna cried out with a loud voice and said, O everlasting God, that
knowest the secrets, and knowest all things before they be <span
id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910.md) .’ Thus it appears that the phrases
‘once was not,’ and ‘before it came to be,’ and ‘when,’ and the like,
belong to things originate and creatures, which come out of nothing, but
are alien to the Word. But if such terms are used in Scripture of things
originate, but ‘ever’ of the Word, it follows, O ye enemies of God, that
the Son did not come out of nothing, nor is in the number of originated
things at all, but is the Father’s Image and Word eternal, never having
not been, but being ever, as the eternal Radiance <span
id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911.md) of a Light which is eternal. Why
imagine then times before the Son? or wherefore blaspheme the Word as
after times, by whom even the ages were made? for how did time or age at
all subsist when the Word, as you say, had not appeared, ‘through’ whom
‘all things have been made and without’ whom ‘not one thing was
made <span id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912.md) ?’ Or why, when you mean
time, do you not plainly say, ‘a time was when the Word was not?’ But
while you drop the word ‘time’ to deceive the simple, you do not at all
conceal your own feeling, nor, even if you did, could you escape
discovery. For you still simply mean times, when you say, ‘There was
when He was not,’ and ‘He was not before His generation.’

<span id="fn_1880"></span>[312:1881](2040349.htm#fr_1880.md) <span
id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p2.2"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p3"></span> Athan. observes that this formula of
the Arians is a mere evasion to escape using the word ‘time.’ vid. also
Cyril. *Thesaur.* iv. pp. 19, 20. Else let them explain,—‘There was,’
*what* ‘when the Son was not?’ or *what* was before the Son? since He
Himself was before all times and ages, which He created, *de Decr.* 18,
note 5. Thus, if ‘when’ be a word of time, He it is who *was* ‘when’ He
*was not*, which is absurd. Did they mean, however, that it was the
Father who ‘was’ before the Son? This was true, if ‘before’ was taken,
not to imply time, but origination or beginning. And in this sense the
first verse of S. John’s Gospel may be interpreted ‘In the Beginning,’
or Origin, i.e. in the Father ‘was the Word.’ Thus Athan. himself
understands that text, *Orat.* iv. §1. vid. also *Orat.* iii. §9;
Nyssen. *contr. Eunom.* iii. p. 106; Cyril. *Thesaur.* 32. p. 312.

Athan. has so interpreted this text supr. *de Decr.* 15. It was either a
received interpretation, or had been adduced at Nicæa, for Asterius had
some years before these Discourses replied to it, vid. *de Syn.* 18, and
*Orat.* ii. §37.

<span id="fn_1887"></span>[312:1888](2040349.htm#fr_1887.md) <span

[17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p10.3"></span>. S. Athanasius observes, *Serap.* i. 4–7,
that the Holy Ghost is never in Scripture called simply ‘Spirit’ without
the addition ‘of God’ or ‘of the Father’ or ‘from Me’ or of the article,
or of ‘Holy,’ or ‘Comforter,’ or ‘of truth,’ or unless He has been
spoken of just before. Accordingly this text is understood of the third
Person in the Holy Trinity by Origen, *contr. Cels.* vi. 70; Basil *de
Sp. S.* n. 32; Pseudo-Athan. *de comm. ess.* 6. On the other hand, the
word <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p10.5"></span>πνεῦμα</span>, ‘Spirit, is used more or
less distinctly for our Lord’s Divine Nature whether in itself or as
incarnate, in <span id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p10.7"></span>[Rom.

id="xxi.ii.i.iv-p10.12"></span>, &c. \[But cf. also Milligan *Resurr.*
238 sq.\] Indeed the early Fathers speak as if the ‘Holy Spirit,’ which
came down upon S. Mary might be considered the Word. E.g. Tertullian
against the Valentinians, ‘If the Spirit of God did not descend into the
womb “to partake in flesh from the womb,” why did He descend at all?’

[Next: Subject Continued. Objection, that the Son's eternity makes Him
coordinate with the Father, introduces the subject of His Divine
Sonship, as a second proof of His eternity. The word Son is introduced
in a secondary, but is to be understood in real sense. Since all things
partake of the Father in partaking of the Son, He is the whole
participation of the Father, that is, He is the Son by nature; for to be
wholly participated is to beget.](2040350.md)
