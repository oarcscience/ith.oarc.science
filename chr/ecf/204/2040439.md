<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>From Letter XLIII</span>.—*(For
371.)*

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xxviii-p2.1"></span>Of</span> us, then, whose also is
the Passover, the calling is from above, and ‘our conversation <span
id="page_553">p. 553</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xxviii-Page_553"></span>is in heaven,’ as Paul says;
‘For we have here no abiding city, but we seek that which is to
come <span id="fr_4551"></span>[4552](#fn_4551.md) ,’ whereto, also,
looking forward, we properly keep the feast. (*And again, afterwards:*)
Heaven truly is high, and its distance from us infinite; for ‘the heaven
of heavens,’ says he, ‘is the Lord’s <span
id="fr_4552"></span>[4553](#fn_4552.md) .’ But not, on that account, are we
to be negligent or fearful, as though the way thereto were impossible;
but rather should we be zealous. Yet not, as in the case of those who
formerly, removing from the east and finding a plain in Senaar, began
\[to build a tower\], is there need for us to bake bricks with fire, and
to seek slime for mortar; for their tongues were confounded, and their
work was destroyed. But for us the Lord has consecrated a way through
His blood, and has made it easy. (*And again:*) For not only has He
afforded us consolation respecting the distance, but also in that He has
come and opened the door for us which was once shut. For, indeed, it was
shut from the time He cast out Adam from the delight of Paradise, and
set the Cherubim and the flaming sword, that turned every way, to keep
the way of the tree of life—now, however, opened wide. And He that
sitteth upon the Cherubim having appeared with greater grace and
loving-kindness, led into Paradise with himself the thief who confessed,
and having entered heaven as our forerunner, opened the gates to all.
(*And again:*) Paul also, ‘pressing toward the mark for the prize of the
high calling <span id="fr_4553"></span>[4554](#fn_4553.md) ,’ by it was
taken up to the third heaven, and having seen those things which are
above, and then descended, he teaches us, announcing what is written to
the Hebrews, and saying, ‘For ye are not come unto the mount that might
be touched, and that burned with fire, and clouds, and darkness, and a
tempest, and to the voice of words. But ye are come unto Mount Sion, and
unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
innumerable company of angels, and to the general assembly and Church of
the first-born, which are written in heaven <span
id="fr_4554"></span>[4555](#fn_4554.md) .’ Who would not wish to enjoy the
high companionship with these! Who not desire to be enrolled with these,
that he may hear with them, ‘Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world <span
id="fr_4555"></span>[4556](#fn_4555.md) .’
