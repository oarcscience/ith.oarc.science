<span id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—<span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p1.2"></span>Subject Continued</span>. *Third proof of
the Son’s eternity, viz. from other titles indicative of His
coessentiality; as the Creator; One of the Blessed Trinity; as Wisdom;
as Word; as Image. If the Son is a perfect Image of the Father, why is
He not a Father also? because God, being perfect, is not the origin of a
race. Only the Father a Father because the Only Father, only the Son a
Son because the Only Son. Men are not really fathers and really sons,
but shadows of the True. The Son does not become a Father, because He
has received from the Father to be immutable and ever the same.*

<span id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p2"></span>17. This is of itself a sufficient
refutation of the Arian heresy; however, its heterodoxy will appear also
from the following:—If God be Maker and Creator, and create His works
through the Son, and we cannot regard things which come to be, except as
being through the Word, is it not blasphemous, God being Maker, to say,
that His Framing Word and His Wisdom once was not? it is the same as
saying, that God is not Maker, if He had not His proper Framing Word
which is from Him, but that that by which He frames, accrues to Him from
without <span id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935.md) , and is alien from
Him, and unlike in essence. Next, let them tell us this,—or rather learn
from it how irreligious they are in saying, ‘Once He was not,’ and, ‘He
was not before His generation;’—for if the Word is not with the Father
from everlasting, the Triad is not everlasting; but a Monad was first,
and afterwards by addition it became a Triad; and so as time went on, it
seems what we know concerning God grew and took shape <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936.md) . And further, if the Son is not
proper offspring of the Father’s essence, but of nothing has come to be,
then of nothing the Triad consists, and once there was not a Triad, but
a Monad; and a Triad once with deficiency, and then complete; deficient,
before the Son was originated, complete when He had come to be; and
henceforth a thing originated is reckoned with the Creator, and what
once was not has divine worship and glory with Him who was ever <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937.md) . Nay, what is more serious still,
the Triad is discovered to be unlike Itself, consisting of strange and
alien natures and essences. And this, in other words, is saying, that
the Triad has an originated consistence. What sort of a religion then is
this, which is not even like itself, but is in process of completion as
time goes on, and is now not thus, and then again thus? For probably it
will receive some fresh accession, and so on without limit, since at
first and at starting it took its consistence by way of accessions. And
so undoubtedly it may decrease on the contrary, for what is added
plainly admits of being subtracted.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p6"></span>18. But this is not so: perish the
thought; the Triad is not originated; but there is an eternal and one
Godhead in a Triad, and <span id="page_317">p. 317</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.i.vi-Page_317"></span>there is one Glory of the Holy Triad.
And you presume to divide it into different natures; the Father being
eternal, yet you say of the Word which is seated by Him, ‘Once He was
not;’ and, whereas the Son is seated by the Father, yet you think to
place Him far from Him. The Triad is Creator and Framer, and you fear
not to degrade It to things which are from nothing; you scruple not to
equal servile beings to the nobility of the Triad, and to rank the King,
the Lord of Sabaoth with subjects <span
id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938.md) . Cease this confusion of things
unassociable, or rather of things which are not with Him who is. Such
statements do not glorify and honour the Lord, but the reverse; for he
who dishonours the Son, dishonours also the Father. For if the doctrine
of God is now perfect in a Triad, and this is the true and only
Religion, and this is the good and the truth, it must have been always
so, unless the good and the truth be something that came after, and the
doctrine of God is completed by additions. I say, it must have been
eternally so; but if not eternally, not so at present either, but at
present so, as you suppose it was from the beginning,—I mean, not a
Triad now. But such heretics no Christian would bear; it belongs to
Greeks, to introduce an originated Triad, and to level It with things
originate; for these do admit of deficiencies and additions; but the
faith of Christians acknowledges the blessed Triad as unalterable and
perfect and ever what It was, neither adding to It what is more, nor
imputing to It any loss (for both ideas are irreligious), and therefore
it dissociates It from all things generated, and it guards as
indivisible and worships the unity of the Godhead Itself; and shuns the
Arian blasphemies, and confesses and acknowledges that the Son was ever;
for He is eternal, as is the Father, of whom He is the Eternal Word,—to
which subject let us now return again.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p8"></span>19. If God be, and be called, the
Fountain of wisdom and life—as He says by Jeremiah, ‘They have forsaken
Me the Fountain of living waters <span
id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939.md) ;’ and again, ‘A glorious high
throne from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary; O Lord, the
Hope of Israel, all that forsake Thee shall be ashamed, and they that
depart from Me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken
the Lord, the Fountain of living waters <span
id="fr_1940"></span>[1941](#fn_1940.md) ;’ and in the book of Baruch it is
written, ‘Thou hast forsaken the Fountain of wisdom <span
id="fr_1941"></span>[1942](#fn_1941.md) ,’—this implies that life and
wisdom are not foreign to the Essence of the Fountain, but are proper to
It, nor were at any time without existence, but were always. Now the Son
is all this, who says, ‘I am the Life <span
id="fr_1942"></span>[1943](#fn_1942.md) ,’ and, ‘I Wisdom dwell with
prudence <span id="fr_1943"></span>[1944](#fn_1943.md) .’ Is it not then
irreligious to say, ‘Once the Son was not?’ for it is all one with
saying, ‘Once the Fountain was dry, destitute of Life and Wisdom.’ But a
fountain it would then cease to be; for what begetteth not from itself,
is not a fountain <span id="fr_1944"></span>[1945](#fn_1944.md) . What a
load of extravagance! for God promises that those who do His will shall
be as a fountain which the water fails not, saying by Isaiah the
prophet, ‘And the Lord shall satisfy thy soul in drought, and make thy
bones fat; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of
water, whose waters fail not <span id="fr_1945"></span>[1946](#fn_1945.md)
.’ And yet these, whereas God is called and is a Fountain of wisdom,
dare to insult Him as barren and void of His proper Wisdom. But their
doctrine is false; truth witnessing that God is the eternal Fountain of
His proper Wisdom; and, if the Fountain be eternal, the Wisdom also must
needs be eternal. For in It were all things made, as David says in the
Psalm, ‘In Wisdom hast Thou made them all <span
id="fr_1946"></span>[1947](#fn_1946.md) ;’ and Solomon says, ‘The Lord by
Wisdom hath formed the earth, by understanding hath He established the
heavens <span id="fr_1947"></span>[1948](#fn_1947.md) .’ And this Wisdom is
the Word, and by Him, as John says, ‘all things were made,’ and ‘without
Him was made not one thing <span id="fr_1948"></span>[1949](#fn_1948.md) .’
And this Word is Christ; for ‘there is One God, the Father, from whom
are all things, and we for Him; and One Lord Jesus Christ, through whom
are all things, and we through Him <span
id="fr_1949"></span>[1950](#fn_1949.md) .’ And if all things are through
Him, He Himself is not to be reckoned with that ‘all.’ For he who
dares <span id="fr_1950"></span>[1951](#fn_1950.md) to call Him, through
whom are things, one of that ‘all,’ surely will have like speculations
concerning God, from whom are all. But if he shrinks from this as
unseemly, and excludes God from that all, it is but consistent that he
should also exclude from that all the Only-Begotten Son, as being proper
to the Father’s essence. And, if He be not one of the all <span
id="fr_1951"></span>[1952](#fn_1951.md) , it is sin to say concerning Him,
‘He was not,’ and ‘He was not before His generation.’ Such words may be
used of the creatures; but as to the Son, He is such as the Father is,
of whose essence He is proper Offspring, Word, and Wisdom <span
id="fr_1952"></span>[1953](#fn_1952.md) . For this is proper to the Son, as
regards the Father, and this shews that the Father is proper to the Son;
that we may neither say that God was ever without Word <span
id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953.md) , nor that the Son <span
id="page_318">p. 318</span> <span id="xxi.ii.i.vi-Page_318"></span>was
non-existent. For wherefore a Son, if not from Him? or wherefore Word
and Wisdom, if not ever proper to Him?

<span id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p24"></span>20. When then was God without that
which is proper to Him? or how can a man consider that which is proper,
as foreign and alien in essence? for other things, according to the
nature of things originate, are without likeness in essence with the
Maker; but are external to Him, made by the Word at His grace and will,
and thus admit of ceasing to be, if it so pleases Him who made
them <span id="fr_1954"></span>[1955](#fn_1954.md) ; for such is the nature
of things originate <span id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955.md) . But as
to what is proper to the Father’s essence (for this we have already
found to be the Son), what daring is it in irreligion to say that ‘This
comes from nothing,’ and that ‘It was not before generation,’ but was
adventitious <span id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956.md) , and can at
some time cease to be again? Let a person only dwell upon this thought,
and he will discern how the perfection and the plenitude of the Father’s
essence is impaired by this heresy; however, he will see its
unseemliness still more clearly, if he considers that the Son is the
Image and Radiance of the Father, and Expression, and Truth. For if,
when Light exists, there be withal its Image, viz. Radiance, and, a
Subsistence existing, there be of it the entire Expression, and, a
Father existing, there be His Truth (viz. the Son); let them consider
what depths of irreligion they fall into, who make time the measure of
the Image and Form of the Godhead. For if the Son was not before His
generation, Truth was not always in God, which it were a sin to say;
for, since the Father was, there was ever in Him the Truth, which is the
Son, who says, ‘I am the Truth <span
id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957.md) .’ And the Subsistence existing, of
course there was forthwith its Expression and Image; for God’s Image is
not delineated from without <span id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958.md) ,
but God Himself hath begotten it; in which seeing Himself, He has
delight, as the Son Himself says, ‘I was His delight <span
id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959.md) .’ When then did the Father not see
Himself in His own Image? or when had He not delight, that a man should
dare to say, ‘the Image is out of nothing,’ and ‘The Father had not
delight before the Image was originated?’ and how should the Maker and
Creator see Himself in a created and originated essence? for such as is
the Father, such must be the Image.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p31"></span>21. Proceed we then to consider the
attributes of the Father, and we shall come to know whether this Image
is really His. The Father is eternal, immortal, powerful, light, King,
Sovereign, God, Lord, Creator, and Maker. These attributes must be in
the Image, to make it true that he ‘that hath seen’ the Son ‘hath seen
the Father <span id="fr_1960"></span>[1961](#fn_1960.md) .’ If the Son be
not all this, but, as the Arians consider, originate, and not eternal,
this is not a true Image of the Father, unless indeed they give up
shame, and go on to say, that the title of Image, given to the Son, is
not a token of a similar essence <span
id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961.md) , but His name <span
id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962.md) only. But this, on the other hand,
O ye enemies of Christ, is not an Image, nor is it an Expression. For
what is the likeness of what is out of nothing to Him who brought what
was nothing into being? or how can that which is not, be like Him that
is, being short of Him in once not being, and in its having its place
among things originate? However, such the Arians wishing Him to be,
devised for themselves arguments such as this;—‘If the Son is the
Father’s offspring and Image, and is like in all things <span
id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963.md) to the Father, then it neces<span
id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.i.vi-Page_319"></span>sarily holds that as He is begotten, so
He begets, and He too becomes father of a son. And again, he who is
begotten from Him, begets in his turn, and so on without limit; for this
is to make the Begotten like Him that begat Him.’ Authors of blasphemy,
verily, are these foes of God! who, sooner than confess that the Son is
the Father’s Image <span id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964.md) , conceive
material and earthly ideas concerning the Father Himself, ascribing to
Him severings and <span id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965.md) effluences
and influences. If then God be as man, let Him become also a parent as
man, so that His Son should be father of another, and so in succession
one from another, till the series they imagine grows into a multitude of
gods. But if God be not as man, as He is not, we must not impute to Him
the attributes of man. For brutes and men, after a Creator has begun
them, are begotten by succession; and the son, having been begotten of a
father who was a son, becomes accordingly in his turn a father to a son,
in inheriting from his father that by which he himself has come to be.
Hence in such instances there is not, properly speaking, either father
or son, nor do the father and the son stay in their respective
characters, for the son himself becomes a father, being son of his
father, but father of his son. But it is not so in the Godhead; for not
as man is God; for the Father is not from a father; therefore doth He
not beget one who shall become a father; nor is the Son from effluence
of the Father, nor is He begotten from a father that was begotten;
therefore neither is He begotten so as to beget. Thus it belongs to the
Godhead alone, that the Father is properly <span
id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966.md) father, and the Son properly son,
and in Them, and Them only, does it hold that the Father is ever Father
and the Son ever Son.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p39"></span>22. Therefore he who asks why the Son
is not to beget a son, must inquire why the Father had not a father. But
both suppositions are unseemly and full of impiety. For as the Father is
ever Father and never could become Son, so the Son is ever Son and never
could become Father. For in this rather is He shewn to be the Father’s
Expression and Image, remaining what He is and not changing, but thus
receiving from the Father to be one and the same. If then the Father
change, let the Image change; for so is the Image and Radiance in its
relation towards Him who begat It. But if the Father is unalterable, and
what He is that He continues, necessarily does the Image also continue
what He is, and will not alter. Now He is Son from the Father; therefore
He will not become other than is proper to the Father’s essence. Idly
then have the foolish ones devised this objection also, wishing to
separate the Image from the Father, that they might level the Son with
things originated.

these instances that the Fathers meant that our Lord was literally what
is called the *attribute* of reason or wisdom in the Divine Essence, or
in other words, that He was God merely viewed as He is wise; which would
be a kind of Sabellianism. But, whereas their opponents said that He was
but *called* Word and Wisdom *after* the attribute (vid. *de Syn.* 15,
note), they said that such titles marked, not only a typical resemblance
to the attribute, but so full a correspondence and (as it were)
coincidence in *nature* with it, that whatever relation that attribute
had to God, such in kind had the Son;—that the attribute was His symbol,
and not His mere archetype; that our Lord was eternal and proper to God,
because that attribute was, which was His title, vid. *Ep. Æg.* 14, that
our Lord was that Essential Reason and Wisdom,—not *by* which the Father
*is* wise, but *without* which the Father was *not* wise;—not, that is,
in the way of a formal cause, but in *fact.* Or, whereas the Father
Himself is Reason and Wisdom, the Son is the necessary result of that
Reason and Wisdom, so that, to say that there was no Word, would imply
there was no Divine Reason; just as a radiance implies a light; or, as
Petavius remarks, l.c. quoting the words which follow shortly after in
the text, the eternity of the Original implies the eternity of the
Image; <span class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p23.4"></span>τῆς

the tenet of our Lord’s consubstantiality or eternal generation. For if
He came into being at the will of God, by the same will He might cease
to be; but if His existence is unconditional and necessary, as God’s
attributes might be, then as He had no beginning, so can He have no end;
for He is in, and one with, the Father, who has neither beginning nor
end. On the question of the ‘will of God’ as it affects the doctrine,

<span id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p29"></span> Athan. argues from the very name
Image for our Lord’s eternity. An Image, to be really such, must be an
expression from the Original, not an external and detached imitation.

with the hand, or a work of art, but a living Image,’ &c. vid. also

fin. Origen observes that man, on the contrary, is an example of an
external or improper image of God. *Periarch.* i. 2. §6. It might have
been more direct to have argued from the name of Image to our Lord’s
consubstantiality rather than eternity, as, e.g. S. Gregory Naz. ‘He is
Image as one in essence, <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p36"></span> The objection is this, that, if our
Lord be the Father’s Image, He ought to resemble Him in being a Father.
S. Athanasius answers that God is not as man; with us a son becomes a
father because our nature is <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p36.2"></span>ῥ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p36.3"></span>ευστὴ</span>, transitive and without stay,
ever shifting and passing on into new forms and relations; but that God
is perfect and ever the same, what He is once that He continues to be;
God the Father remains Father, and God the Son remains Son. Moreover men
become fathers by detachment and transmission, and what is received is
handed on in a succession; whereas the Father, by imparting Himself
wholly, begets the Son: and a perfect nativity finds its termination in
itself. The Son has not a Son, because the Father has not a Father. Thus
the Father is the only true Father, and the Son alone true Son; the
Father only a Father, the Son only a Son; being really in their Persons
what human fathers are but by office, character, accident, and name;
vid. *De Decr.* 11, note 6. And since the Father is unchangeable as
Father, in nothing does the Son more fulfil the idea of a perfect Image
than in being unchangeable too. Thus S. Cyril also, *Thesaur.* 10. p.
124. And this perhaps may illustrate a strong and almost startling
implication of some of the Greek Fathers, that the First Person in the
Holy Trinity, is not God \[*in virtue* of His Fatherhood\]. E.g. <span
class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.i.vi-p36.5"></span>εἰ δὲ θεὸς ὁ υἱ&
232·ς, οὐκ ἐπεὶ υἱ& 231·ς· ὁμοίως καὶ ὁ πατὴρ, οὐκ ἐπεὶ πατὴρ, θεός·
ἀλλ᾽ ἐπεὶ οὐσία τοιάδε, εἷς ἐστὶ πατὴρ καὶ ὁ υἱ& 232·ς θεός</span>.
*Nyssen.* t. i. p. 915. vid. Petav. *de Deo* i. 9. §13. Should it be
asked, ‘What is the Father if not God?’ it is enough to answer, ‘the
Father.’ Men differ from each other as being individuals, but the
characteristic difference between Father and Son is, not that they are
individuals, but that they *are* Father and Son. In these extreme
statements it must be ever borne in mind that we are contemplating
divine things according to *our notions.* not in *fact:* i.e. speaking
of the Almighty Father, *as such;* there being no real separation
between His Person and His Substance. It may be added, that, though
theologians differ in their decisions, it would appear that our Lord is
not the Image of the Father’s person, but of the Father’s substance; in
other words, not of the Father considered as Father, but considered as
God. That is, God the Son is like and equal to God the Father, because
they are both the same God. *De Syn.* 49. note 4, also next note.

Elsewhere Athan. says, ‘The Father being one and only is Father of a Son
one and only; and in the instance of Godhead only have the names Father
and Son stay, and are ever; for of men if any one be called father, yet
he has been son of another; and if he be called son, yet is he called
father of another; so that in the case of men the names father and son
do not properly, <span class="Greek"><span
