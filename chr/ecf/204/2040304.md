<span id="xix.ii.i-p3"></span>1. *Athanasius charged with cowardice for
escaping.*

<span id="xix.ii.i-p4"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xix.ii.i-p4.1"></span>I hear</span> that Leontius <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388) , now at Antioch, and
Narcissus <span id="fr_1389"></span>[1390](#fn_1389) of the city of
Nero, and George <span id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390) , now at
Laodicea, and the Arians who are with them, are spreading abroad many
slanderous reports concerning me, charging me with cowardice, because
forsooth, when I myself was sought by them, I did not surrender myself
into their hands. Now as to their imputations and calumnies, although
there are many things that I could write, which even they are unable to
deny, and which all who have heard of their proceedings know to be true,
yet I shall not be prevailed upon to make any reply to them, except only
to remind them of the words of our Lord, and of the declaration of the
Apostle, that ‘a lie is of the Devil,’ and that, ‘revilers shall not
inherit the kingdom of God <span id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391) .’
For it is sufficient thereby to prove, that neither their thoughts nor
their words are according to the Gospel, but that after their own
pleasure, whatsoever themselves desire, that they think to be good.
