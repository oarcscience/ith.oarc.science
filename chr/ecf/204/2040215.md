<span id="xvi.ii.iv-p1"></span> 3. And again as he went into the church,
hearing the Lord say in the Gospel <span
id="fr_992"></span>[993](#fn_992.md) , ‘be not anxious for the morrow,’ he
could stay no longer, but went out and gave those things also to the
poor. Having committed his sister to known and faithful virgins, and put
her into a convent <span id="fr_993"></span>[994](#fn_993.md) to be brought
up, he henceforth devoted himself outside his house to discipline <span
id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994.md) , taking heed to himself and training
himself with patience. For there were not yet so many monasteries <span
id="fr_995"></span>[996](#fn_995.md) in Egypt, and no monk at all knew of
the distant desert; but all who wished to give heed to themselves
practised the discipline in solitude near their own village. Now there
was then in the next village an old man who had lived the life of a
hermit from his youth up. Antony, after he had seen this man, imitated
him in piety. And at first he began to abide in places outside the
village: then if he heard of a good man anywhere, like the prudent bee,
he went forth and sought him, nor turned back to his own palace until he
had seen him; and he returned, having got from the good man as it were
supplies for his journey in the way of virtue. So dwelling there at
first, he confirmed his purpose not to return to the abode of his
fathers nor to the remembrance of his kinsfolk; but to keep all his
desire and energy for perfecting his discipline. He worked, however,
with his hands, having heard, ‘he who is idle let him not eat <span
id="fr_996"></span>[997](#fn_996.md) ,’ and part he spent on bread and part
he gave to the needy. And he was constant in prayer, knowing that a man
ought to pray in secret unceasingly <span
id="fr_997"></span>[998](#fn_997.md) . For he had given such heed to what
was read that none of the things that were written fell from him to the
ground, but he remembered all, and afterwards his memory served him for
books.

<span id="xvi.ii.iv-p8"></span>4. Thus conducting himself, Antony was
beloved by all. He subjected himself in sincerity to the good men whom
he visited, and learned thoroughly where each surpassed him in zeal and
discipline. He observed the graciousness of one; the unceasing prayer of
another; he took knowledge of another’s freedom from anger and another’s
loving-kindness; he gave heed to one as he watched, to another as he
studied; one he admired for his endurance, another for his fasting and
sleeping on the ground; the meekness of one and the long-suffering of
another he watched with care, while he took note of the piety towards
Christ and the mutual love which animated all. Thus filled, he returned
to his own place of discipline, and henceforth would strive to unite the
qualities of each, and was eager to show in himself the virtues of all.
With others of the same age he had no rivalry; save this only, that he
should not be second to them in higher things. And this he did so as to
hurt the feelings of nobody, but made them rejoice over him. So all they
of that village and the good men in whose intimacy he was, when they saw
that he was a man of this sort, used to call him God-beloved. And some
welcomed him as a son, others as a brother.

<span id="xvi.ii.iv-p3"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv-p3.1"></span>Παρθενών</span>: the earliest use of the word
in this sense. Perhaps a house occupied by Virgins is implied in *Apol.
c. Ar.* 15. But at this time virgins generally lived with their
families. See D.C.A. 2021b (the reference to Tertullian is not
relevant), Eichhorn, pp. 4, sqq., 28–30.
