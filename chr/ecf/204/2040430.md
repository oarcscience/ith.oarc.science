<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>From Letter XXVII</span>.—*(For 355.)
From the twenty-seventh Festal Letter of Athanasius, Bishop of
Alexandria and Confessor; of which the commencement is, ‘Again the
season of the day of the living Passover <span
id="fr_4524"></span>[4525](#fn_4524.md) .’*

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xix-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xix-p3.1"></span>For</span> who is our joy and boast,
but our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, Who suffered for us, and by
Himself made known to us the Father? For He is no other than He Who of
old time spoke by the Prophets; but now He saith to every man, ‘I Who
speak am near <span id="fr_4525"></span>[4526](#fn_4525.md) .’ Right well
is this word spoken, for He does not at one time speak, at another keep
silence; but continually and at all times, from the beginning without
ceasing, He raises up every man, and speaks to every man in his heart.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xix-p2"></span> The fragment here given of the
twenty-seventh Letter, as well as fragments of the twenty-ninth and
forty-fourth, are from Syriac translations, discovered by Mr. Cureton as
quoted by Severus Patriarch of Antioch, in his work against Johannes
Grammaticus contained in the Syriac collection of the British Museum
(Cod. Add. 12, 157, fol. 202), and published by him with the preceding
Letters. Their style would argue them to be part of the same
translation.
