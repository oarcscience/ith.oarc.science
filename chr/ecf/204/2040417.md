<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Letter VI</span>.—*For 334. Easter-day,
xii Pharmuthi, vii Id. April; xvii Moon; Æra Dioclet. 50; Coss. Optatus
Patricius, Anicius Paulinus; Præfect, Philagrius* <span
id="fr_4071"></span>[4072](#fn_4071.md) , *the Cappadocian; vii Indict.*

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p3"></span>Now again, my beloved, has God
brought us to the season of the feast, and through His loving-kindness
we have reached the period of assembly for it. For that God who brought
Israel out of Egypt, even He at this time calls us to the feast, saying
by Moses, ‘Observe the month of new fruits <span
id="fr_4072"></span>[4073](#fn_4072.md) , and keep the Passover to the Lord
thy God <span id="fr_4073"></span>[4074](#fn_4073.md) :’ and by the
prophet, ‘Keep thy feasts, O Judah; pay to the Lord thy vows <span
id="fr_4074"></span>[4075](#fn_4074.md) .’ If then God Himself loves the
feast, and calls us to it, it is not right, my brethren, that it should
be delayed, or observed carelessly; but with alacrity and zeal we should
come to it, so that having begun joyfully here, we may also receive an
earnest of that heavenly feast. For if we diligently celebrate the feast
here, we shall doubtless receive the perfect joy which is in heaven, as
<span id="page_520">p. 520</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-Page_520"></span>the Lord says; ‘With desire I have
desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I say unto
you, that I will not eat it, until it is fulfilled with you in the
kingdom of God <span id="fr_4075"></span>[4076](#fn_4075.md) .’ Now we eat
it if, understanding the reason of the feast, and acknowledging the
Deliverer, we conduct ourselves in accordance with His grace, as Paul
saith; ‘So that we may keep the Feast, not with old leaven, neither with
the leaven of wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and
truth <span id="fr_4076"></span>[4077](#fn_4076.md) .’ For the Lord died in
those days, that we should no longer do the deeds of death. He gave His
life, that we might preserve our own from the snares of the devil. And,
what is most wonderful, the Word became flesh, that we should no longer
live in the flesh, but in spirit should worship God, who is Spirit. He
who is not so disposed, abuses the days, and does not keep the feast,
but like an unthankful person finds fault with the grace, and honours
the days overmuch, while he does not supplicate the Lord who in those
days redeemed him. Let him by all means hear, though fancying that he
keeps the feast, the Apostolic voice reproving him; ‘Ye observe days,
and months, and times, and years: I fear lest I have laboured among you
in vain <span id="fr_4077"></span>[4078](#fn_4077.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p10"></span>2. For the feast is not on account
of the days; but for the Lord’s sake, who then suffered for us, we
celebrate it, for ‘our Passover Christ, is sacrificed <span
id="fr_4078"></span>[4079](#fn_4078.md) .’ Even as Moses, when teaching
Israel not to consider the feast as pertaining to the days, but to the
Lord, said, ‘It is the Lord’s Passover <span
id="fr_4079"></span>[4080](#fn_4079.md) .’ To the Jews, when they thought
they were keeping the Passover, because they persecuted the Lord, the
feast was useless; since it no longer bore the name of the Lord, even
according to their own testimony. It was not the Passover of the Lord,
but that of the Jews <span id="fr_4080"></span>[4081](#fn_4080.md) . The
Passover was named after the Jews, my brethren, because they denied the
Lord of the Passover. On this account, the Lord, turning away His face
from such a doctrine of theirs, saith, ‘Your new moons and your sabbaths
My soul hateth <span id="fr_4081"></span>[4082](#fn_4081.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p15"></span>3. So now, those who keep the
Passover in like manner, the Lord again reproves, as He did those lepers
who were cleansed, when He loved the one as thankful, but was angry with
the others as ungrateful, because they did not acknowledge their
Deliverer, but thought more of the cure of the leprosy than of Him who
healed them. ‘But one of them when he saw that he was healed, turned
back, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell on his face at the
feet of Jesus giving Him thanks; and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus
answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but those nine—whence are
there none found who returned to give glory to God, but this
stranger <span id="fr_4082"></span>[4083](#fn_4082.md) ?’ And there was
more given to him than to the rest; for being cleansed from his leprosy,
he heard from the Lord, ‘Arise, go thy way, thy faith hath saved
thee <span id="fr_4083"></span>[4084](#fn_4083.md) .’ For he who gives
thanks, and he who glorifies, have kindred feelings, in that they bless
their Helper for the benefits they have received. So the Apostle exhorts
all men to this, saying, ‘Glorify God with your body;’ and the prophet
commands, saying, ‘Give glory to God.’ Although testimony was borne by
Caiaphas <span id="fr_4084"></span>[4085](#fn_4084.md) against our
Redeemer, and He was set at nought by the Jews, and was condemned by
Pilate in those days, yet exalted exceedingly and most mighty was the
voice of the Father which came to Him; ‘I have glorified, and will
glorify again <span id="fr_4085"></span>[4086](#fn_4085.md) .’ For those
things which He suffered for our sake have passed away; but those which
belong to Him as the Saviour remain for ever.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p20"></span>4. But in our commemoration of
these things, my brethren, let us not be occupied with meats, but let us
glorify the Lord, let us become fools for Him who died for us, even as
Paul said; ‘For if we are foolish, it is to God; or if we are
sober-minded, it is to you; since because one died for all men,
therefore all were dead to Him; and He died for all, that we who live
should not henceforth live to ourselves, but to Him who died for us, and
rose again <span id="fr_4086"></span>[4087](#fn_4086.md) .’ No longer then
ought we to live to ourselves, but, as servants to the Lord. And not in
vain should we receive the grace, as the time is especially an
acceptable one <span id="fr_4087"></span>[4088](#fn_4087.md) , and the day
of salvation hath dawned, even the death of our Redeemer <span
id="fr_4088"></span>[4089](#fn_4088.md) . For even for our sakes the Word
came down, and being incorruptible, put on a corruptible body for the
salvation of all of us. Of which Paul was confident, saying, ‘This
corruptible must put on incorruption <span
id="fr_4089"></span>[4090](#fn_4089.md) .’ The Lord too was sacrificed,
that by His blood He might abolish death. Full well did He once, in a
certain place, blame those who participated vainly in the shedding of
His blood, while they did not delight themselves in the flesh of the
Word, saying, ‘What profit is there in my blood, that I go down to
corruption <span id="fr_4090"></span>[4091](#fn_4090.md) ?’ This does not
mean that the descent of the Lord was without profit, for it gained the
whole world; but rather that <span id="page_521">p. 521</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-Page_521"></span>after He had thus suffered, sinners
would prefer to suffer loss than to profit by it. For He regarded our
salvation as a delight and a peculiar gain; while on the contrary He
looked upon our destruction as loss.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p26"></span>5. Also in the Gospel, He praises
those who increased the grace twofold, both him who made ten talents of
five, and him who made four talents of two, as those who had profited,
and turned them to good account; but him who hid the talent He cast out
as wanting, saying to him, ‘Thou wicked servant! oughtest thou not to
have put My money to the exchangers? then at My coming I should have
received Mine own with interest. Take, therefore, from him the talent,
and give it to him that hath ten talents. For to every one that hath
shall be given, and he shall have more abundantly; but from him that
hath not, shall be taken away even that which he hath. And cast ye the
unprofitable servant into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth <span id="fr_4091"></span>[4092](#fn_4091.md) .’ For it
is not His will that the grace we have received should be unprofitable;
but He requires us to take pains to render Him His own fruits, as the
blessed Paul saith; ‘The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, and
peace <span id="fr_4092"></span>[4093](#fn_4092.md) .’ Having therefore
this right resolution, and owing no man anything, but rather giving
everything to every man, he was a teacher of the like rightness of
principle, saying, ‘Render to all their dues <span
id="fr_4093"></span>[4094](#fn_4093.md) .’ He was like those sent by the
householder to receive the fruits of the vineyard from the
husbandmen <span id="fr_4094"></span>[4095](#fn_4094.md) ; for he exhorted
all men to render a return. But Israel despised and would not render,
for their will was not right, nay moreover they killed those that were
sent, and not even before the Lord of the vineyard were they ashamed,
but even He was slain by them. Verily, when He came and found no fruit
in them, He cursed them through the fig-tree, saying, ‘Let there be
henceforth no fruit from thee <span id="fr_4095"></span>[4096](#fn_4095.md)
;’ and the fig-tree was dead and fruitless so that even the disciples
wondered when it withered away.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p32"></span>6. Then was fulfilled that which
was spoken by the prophet; ‘I will take away from them the voice of joy
and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of
the bride, the scent of myrrh, and the light of a lamp, and the whole
land shall be destroyed <span id="fr_4096"></span>[4097](#fn_4096.md) .’
For the whole service of the law has been abolished from them, and
henceforth and for ever they remain without a feast. And they observe
not the Passover; for how can they? They have no abiding place, but they
wander everywhere. And they eat unleavened bread contrary to the law,
since they are unable first to sacrifice the lamb, as they were
commanded to do when eating unleavened bread. But in every place they
transgress the law, and as the judgments of God require, they keep days
of grief instead of gladness. Now the cause of this to them was the
slaying of the Lord, and that they did not reverence the Only-Begotten.
At this time the altogether wicked heretics and ignorant schismatics are
in the same case; the one in that they slay the Word, the other in that
they rend the coat. They too remain expelled from the feast, because
they live without godliness and knowledge, and emulate the conduct shewn
in the matter of Bar-Abbas the robber, whom the Jews desired instead of
the Saviour. Therefore the Lord cursed them under the figure of the
fig-tree. Yet even thus He spared them in His loving-kindness, not
destroying them root and all. For He did not curse the root, but
\[said\], that no man should eat fruit of it thenceforth. When He did
this, He abolished the shadow, causing it to wither; but preserved the
root, so that we might \[not\] <span
id="fr_4097"></span>[4098](#fn_4097.md) be grafted upon it; ‘they too, if
they abide not in unbelief, may attain to be grafted into their own
olive tree <span id="fr_4098"></span>[4099](#fn_4098.md) .’ Now when the
Lord had cursed them because of their negligence, He removed from them
the new moons, the true lamb, and that which is truly the Passover.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p36"></span>7. But to us it came: there came
too the solemn day, in which we ought to call to the feast with a
trumpet <span id="fr_4099"></span>[4100](#fn_4099.md) , and separate
ourselves to the Lord with thanksgiving, considering it as our own
festival <span id="fr_4100"></span>[4101](#fn_4100.md) . For we are bound
to celebrate it, not to ourselves but to the Lord; and to rejoice, not
in ourselves but in the Lord, who bore our griefs and said, ‘My soul is
sorrowful unto death <span id="fr_4101"></span>[4102](#fn_4101.md) .’ For
the heathen, and all those who are strangers to our faith, keep feasts
according to their own wills, and have no peace, since they commit evil
against God. But the saints, as they live to the Lord also keep the
feast to Him, saying, ‘I will rejoice in Thy salvation,’ and, ‘my soul
shall be joyful in the Lord.’ The commandment is common to them,
‘Rejoice, ye righteous, in the Lord <span
id="fr_4102"></span>[4103](#fn_4102.md) ’—so that they also may be gathered
together, to sing that common and festal Psalm, ‘Come, let us
rejoice <span id="fr_4103"></span>[4104](#fn_4103.md) ,’ not in ourselves,
but, ‘in the Lord.’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p42"></span><span id="page_522">p. 522</span>
<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-Page_522"></span>8. For thus the patriarch
Abraham rejoiced not to see his own day, but that of the Lord; and thus
looking forward ‘he saw it, and was glad <span
id="fr_4104"></span>[4105](#fn_4104.md) .’ And when he was tried, by faith
he offered up Isaac, and sacrificed his only-begotten son—he who had
received the promises. And, in offering his son, he worshipped the Son
of God. And, being restrained from sacrificing Isaac, he saw the Messiah
in the ram <span id="fr_4105"></span>[4106](#fn_4105.md) , which was
offered up instead as a sacrifice to God. The patriarch was tried,
through Isaac, not however that he was sacrificed, but He who was
pointed out in Isaiah; ‘He shall be led as a lamb to the slaughter, and
as a sheep before her shearers he shall be speechless <span
id="fr_4106"></span>[4107](#fn_4106.md) ;’ but He took away the sin of the
world. And on this account \[Abraham\] was restrained from laying his
hand on the lad, lest the Jews, taking occasion from the sacrifice of
Isaac, should reject the prophetic declarations concerning our Saviour,
even all of them, but more especially those uttered by the Psalmist;
‘Sacrifice and offering Thou wouldest not; a body Thou hast prepared
Me <span id="fr_4107"></span>[4108](#fn_4107.md) ;’ and should refer all
such things as these to the son of Abraham.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p47"></span>9. For the sacrifice was not
properly the setting to rights <span
id="fr_4108"></span>[4109](#fn_4108.md) of Isaac, but of Abraham who also
offered, and by that was tried. Thus God accepted the will of the
offerer, but prevented that which was offered from being sacrificed. For
the death of Isaac did not procure freedom to the world, but that of our
Saviour alone, by whose stripes we all are healed <span
id="fr_4109"></span>[4110](#fn_4109.md) . For He raised up the falling,
healed the sick, satisfied those who were hungry, and filled the poor,
and, what is more wonderful, raised us all from the dead; having
abolished death, He has brought us from affliction and sighing to the
rest and gladness of this feast, a joy which reacheth even to heaven.
For not we alone are affected by this, but because of it, even the
heavens rejoice with us, and the whole church of the firstborn, written
in heaven <span id="fr_4110"></span>[4111](#fn_4110.md) , is made glad
together, as the prophet proclaims, saying, ‘Rejoice, ye heavens, for
the Lord hath had mercy upon Israel. Shout, ye foundations of the earth.
Cry out with joy, ye mountains, ye high places, and all the trees which
are in them, for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and Israel hath been
glorified <span id="fr_4111"></span>[4112](#fn_4111.md) .’ And again;
‘Rejoice, and be glad, ye heavens; let the hills melt into gladness, for
the Lord hath had mercy on His people, and comforted the oppressed of
the people <span id="fr_4112"></span>[4113](#fn_4112.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p53"></span>10. The whole creation keeps a
feast, my brethren, and everything that hath breath praises the
Lord <span id="fr_4113"></span>[4114](#fn_4113.md) , as the Psalmist
\[says\], on account of the destruction of the enemies, and our
salvation. And justly indeed; for if there is joy in heaven over one
sinner that repenteth <span id="fr_4114"></span>[4115](#fn_4114.md) , what
should there not be over the abolition of sin, and the resurrection of
the dead? Oh what a feast and how great the gladness in heaven! how must
all its hosts joy and exult, as they rejoice and watch in our
assemblies, those that are held continually, and especially those at
Easter? For they look on sinners while they repent; on those who have
turned away their faces, when they become converted; on those who
formerly persisted in lusts and excess, but who now humble themselves by
fastings and temperance; and, finally, on the enemy who lies weakened,
lifeless, bound hand and foot, so that we may mock at him; ‘Where is thy
victory, O Death? where is thy sting, O Grave <span
id="fr_4115"></span>[4116](#fn_4115.md) ?’ Let us then sing unto the Lord a
song of victory.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p57"></span>11. Who then will lead us to such a
company of angels as this? Who, coming with a desire for the heavenly
feast, and the angelic holiday, will say like the prophet, ‘I will pass
to the place of the wondrous tabernacle, unto the house of God; with the
voice of joy and praise, with the shouting of those who keep
festival <span id="fr_4116"></span>[4117](#fn_4116.md) ?’ To this course
the saints also encourage us, saying, ‘Come, let us go up to the
mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob <span
id="fr_4117"></span>[4118](#fn_4117.md) .’ But not for the impure is this
feast, nor is the ascent thereto for sinners; but it is for the virtuous
and diligent; and for those who live according to the aim of the saints;
for, ‘Who shall ascend to the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in
His holy place, but he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath
not devoted his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour.
For he,’ as the Psalmist adds, when he goes up, ‘shall receive a
blessing from the Lord <span id="fr_4118"></span>[4119](#fn_4118.md) .’ Now
this clearly also refers to what the Lord gives to them at the right
hand, saying, ‘Come, ye blessed, inherit the kingdom prepared for
you <span id="fr_4119"></span>[4120](#fn_4119.md) .’ But the deceitful, and
he that is not pure of heart, and possesses nothing that is pure (as the
Proverb saith, ‘To a deceitful man there is nothing good <span
id="fr_4120"></span>[4121](#fn_4120) ’.md), shall assuredly, being a
stranger, and of a different race from the saints, be accounted unworthy
to eat the Passover, for ‘a foreigner shall not <span id="page_523">p.
523</span> <span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-Page_523"></span>eat of it <span
id="fr_4121"></span>[4122](#fn_4121.md) .’ Thus Judas, when he thought he
kept the Passover, because he plotted deceit against the Saviour, was
estranged from the city which is above, and from the apostolic company.
For the law commanded the Passover to be eaten with due observance; but
he, while eating it, was sifted of the devil <span
id="fr_4122"></span>[4123](#fn_4122.md) , who had entered his soul.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p65"></span>12. Wherefore let us not celebrate
the feast after an earthly manner, but as keeping festival in heaven
with the angels. Let us glorify the Lord, by chastity, by righteousness,
and other virtues. And let us rejoice, not in ourselves, but in the
Lord, that we may be inheritors with the saints. Let us keep the feast
then, as Moses. Let us watch like David who rose seven times, and in the
middle of the night gave thanks for the righteous judgments of God. Let
us be early, as he said, ‘In the morning I will stand before Thee, and
Thou wilt look upon me: in the morning Thou wilt hear my voice <span
id="fr_4123"></span>[4124](#fn_4123.md) .’ Let us fast like Daniel; let us
pray without ceasing, as Paul commanded; all of us recognising the
season of prayer, but especially those who are honourably married; so
that having borne witness to these things, and thus having kept the
feast, we may be able to enter into the joy of Christ in the kingdom of
heaven <span id="fr_4124"></span>[4125](#fn_4124.md) . But as Israel, when
going up to Jerusalem, was first purified in the wilderness, being
trained to forget the customs of Egypt, the Word by this typifying to us
the holy fast of forty days, let us first be purified and freed from
defilement <span id="fr_4125"></span>[4126](#fn_4125.md) , so that when we
depart hence, having been careful of fasting, we may be able to ascend
to the upper chamber <span id="fr_4126"></span>[4127](#fn_4126.md) with the
Lord, to sup with Him; and may be partakers of the joy which is in
heaven. In no other manner is it possible to go up to Jerusalem, and to
eat the Passover, except by observing the fast of forty days.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p70"></span>13. We begin the fast of forty days
on the first day of the month Phamenoth (Feb. 25); and having prolonged
it till the fifth of Pharmuthi (Mar. 31<span
id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p70.1"></span>), suspending it upon the Sundays and
the Saturdays <span id="fr_4127"></span>[4128](#fn_4127.md) preceding them,
we then begin again on the holy days of Easter, on the sixth of
Pharmuthi (Apr, 1), and cease on the eleventh of the same month (Apr.
6), late in the evening <span id="fr_4128"></span>[4129](#fn_4128.md) of
the Saturday, whence dawns on us the holy Sunday, on the twelfth of
Pharmuthi (Apr. 7), which extends its beams, with unobscured grace, to
all the seven weeks of the holy Pentecost. Resting on that day, let us
ever keep Easter joy in Christ Jesus our Lord, through Whom, to the
Father, be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. All the brethren
who are with me salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vi-p73"></span>Here endeth the sixth Festal Letter
of the holy and God-clad Athanasius.
