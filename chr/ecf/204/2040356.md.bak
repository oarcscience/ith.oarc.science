<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—<span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p1.2"></span>Texts Explained; And First,</span> [Phil.
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010.md)<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p1.3"></span>
*Various texts which are alleged against the Catholic doctrine: e.g.*
<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p1.4"></span>*[Phil.
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p1.5"></span>. Whether the words ‘Wherefore God hath
highly exalted’ prove moral probation and advancement. Argued against,
first, from the force of the word ‘Son;’ which is inconsistent with such
an interpretation. Next, the passage examined. Ecclesiastical sense of
‘highly exalted,’ and ‘gave,’ and ‘wherefore;’ viz. as being spoken with
reference to our Lord’s manhood. Secondary sense; viz. as implying the
Word’s ‘exaltation’ through the resurrection in the same sense in which
Scripture speaks of His descent in the Incarnation; how the phrase does
not derogate from the nature of the Word.*

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p2"></span>37. <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p2.1"></span>But</span> since they allege the divine
oracles and force on them a misinterpretation, according to their
private sense <span id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022.md) , it becomes
necessary to meet them just so far as to vindicate these passages, and
to shew that they <span id="page_328">p. 328</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-Page_328"></span>bear an orthodox sense, and that our
opponents are in error. They say then, that the Apostle writes,
‘Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a Name which
is above every name; that in the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth <span
id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023.md) ;’ and David, ‘Wherefore God even
Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy
fellows <span id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024.md) .’ Then they urge, as
something acute: ‘If He was exalted and received grace, on a
‘wherefore,’ and on a ‘wherefore’ He was anointed, He received a reward
of His purpose; but having acted from purpose, He is altogether of an
alterable nature.’ This is what Eusebius <span
id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025.md) and Arius have dared to say, nay to
write; while their partizans do not shrink from conversing about it in
full market-place, not seeing how mad an argument they use. For if He
received what He had as a reward of His purpose, and would not have had
it, unless He had needed it, and had His work to shew for it, then
having gained it from virtue and promotion, with reason had He
‘therefore’ been called Son and God, without being very Son. For what is
from another by nature, is a real offspring, as Isaac was to Abraham,
and Joseph to Jacob, and the radiance to the sun; but the so called sons
from virtue and grace, have but in place of nature a grace by
acquisition, and are something else besides <span
id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026.md) the gift itself; as the men who
have received the Spirit by participation, concerning whom Scripture
saith, ‘I begat and exalted children, and they rebelled against Me <span
id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027.md) .’ And of course, since they were
not sons by nature, therefore, when they altered, the Spirit was taken
away and they were disinherited; and again on their repentance that God
who thus at the beginning gave them grace, will receive them, and give
light, and call them sons again.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p9"></span>38. But if they say this of the Saviour
also, it follows that He is neither very God nor very Son, nor like the
Father, nor in any wise has God for a Father of His being according to
essence, but of the mere grace given to Him, and for a Creator of His
being according to essence, after the similitude of all others. And
being such, as they maintain, it will be manifest further that He had
not the name ‘Son’ from the first, if so be it was the prize of works
done and of that very same advance which He made when He became man, and
took the form of the servant; but then, when, after becoming ‘obedient
unto death,’ He was, as the text says, ‘highly exalted,’ and received
that ‘Name’ as a grace, ‘that in the Name of Jesus every knee should
bow <span id="fr_2028"></span>[2029](#fn_2028.md) .’ What then was before
this, if then He was exalted, and then began to be worshipped, and then
was called Son, when He became man? For He seems Himself not to have
promoted the flesh at all, but rather to have been Himself promoted
through it, if, according to their perverseness, He was then exalted and
called Son, when He became man. What then was before this? One must urge
the question on them again, to make it understood what their irreligious
doctrine results in <span id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029.md) . For if
the Lord be God, Son, Word, yet was not all these before He became man,
either He was something else beside these, and afterwards became
partaker of them for His virtue’s sake, as we have said; or they must
adopt the alternative (may it return upon their heads!) that He was not
before that time, but is wholly man by nature and nothing more. But this
is no sentiment of the Church. but of the Samosatene and of the present
Jews. Why then, if they think as Jews, are they not circumcised with
them too, instead of pretending Christianity, while they are its foes?
For if He was not, or was indeed, but afterwards was promoted, how were
all things made by Him, or how in Him, were He not perfect, did the
Father delight <span id="fr_2030"></span>[2031](#fn_2030.md) ? And He, on
the other hand, if now promoted, how did He before rejoice in the
presence of the Father? And, if He received His worship after dying, how
is Abraham seen to worship Him in the tent <span
id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031.md) , and Moses in the bush? and, as
Daniel saw, myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands were
ministering unto Him? And if, as they say, He had His promotion now, how
did the Son Himself make mention of that His glory before and above the
world, when He said, ‘Glorify Thou Me, O Father, with the glory which I
had with Thee before the world was <span
id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032.md) .’ If, as they say, He was then
exalted, how did He before that ‘bow the heavens and come down;’ and
again, ‘The Highest gave His thunder <span
id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033.md) ?’ Therefore, if, even before the
world was made, the Son had <span id="page_329">p. 329</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-Page_329"></span>that glory, and was Lord of glory and
the Highest, and descended from heaven, and is ever to be worshipped, it
follows that He had not promotion from His descent, but rather Himself
promoted the things which needed promotion; and if He descended to
effect their promotion, therefore He did not receive in reward the name
of the Son and God, but rather He Himself has made us sons of the
Father, and deified men by becoming Himself man.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p16"></span>39. Therefore He was not man, and then
became God, but He was God, and then became man, and that to deify
us <span id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034.md) . Since, if when He became
man, only then He was called Son and God, but before He became man, God
called the ancient people sons, and made Moses a god of Pharaoh (and
Scripture says of many, ‘God standeth in the congregation of Gods <span
id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035) ’.md), it is plain that He is called
Son and God later than they. How then are all things through Him, and He
before all? or how is He ‘first-born of the whole creation <span
id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036.md) ,’ if He has others before Him who
are called sons and gods? And how is it that those first partakers <span
id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037.md) do not partake of the Word? This
opinion is not true; it is a device of our present Judaizers. For how in
that case can any at all know God as their Father? for adoption there
could not be apart from the real Son, who says, ‘No one knoweth the
Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him <span
id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038.md) .’ And how can there be deifying
apart from the Word and before Him? yet, saith He to their brethren the
Jews, ‘If He called them gods, unto whom the Word of God came <span
id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039.md) .’ And if all that are called sons
and gods, whether in earth or in heaven, were adopted and deified
through the Word, and the Son Himself is the Word, it is plain that
through Him are they all, and He Himself before all, or rather He
Himself only is very Son <span id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040.md) ,
and He alone is very God from the very God, not receiving these
prerogatives as a reward for His virtue, nor being another beside them,
but being all these by nature and according to essence. For He is
Offspring of the Father’s essence, so that one cannot doubt that after
the resemblance of the unalterable Father, the Word also is unalterable.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p24"></span>40. Hitherto we have met their
irrational conceits with the true conceptions <span
id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041.md) implied in the Word ‘Son,’ as the
Lord Himself has given us. But it will be well next to cite the divine
oracles, that the unalterableness of the Son and His unchangeable
nature, which is the Father’s, as well as their perverseness, may be
still more fully proved. The Apostle then, writing to the Philippians,
says, ‘Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who, being
in the form of God, thought it not a prize to be equal with God; but
emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the
likeness of men. And, being found in fashion as a man, He humbled
Himself, becoming obedient to death, even the death of the cross.
Wherefore God also highly exalted Him, and gave Him a Name which is
above every name; that in the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and
that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory
of God the Father <span id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042.md) .’ Can
anything be plainer and more express than this? He was not from a lower
state promoted: but rather, existing as God, He took the form of a
servant, and in taking it, was not promoted but humbled Himself. Where
then is there here any reward of virtue, or what advancement and
promotion in humiliation? For if, being God, He became man, and
descending from on high He is still said to be exalted, where is He
exalted, being God? this withal being plain, that, since God is highest
of all, His Word must necessarily be highest also. Where then could He
be exalted higher, who is in the Father and like the Father in all
things <span id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043.md) ? Therefore He is
beyond the need of any addition; nor is such as the Arians think Him.
For though the Word has descended in order to be exalted, and so it is
written, yet what need was there that He should humble Himself, as if to
seek that which He had already? And what grace did He receive who is the
Giver of grace <span id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044.md) ? or how did
He receive that Name for worship, who is always worshipped by His Name?
Nay, certainly before He became man, the sacred writers invoke Him,
‘Save me, O God, for Thy Name’s sake <span
id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045.md) ;’and again, ‘Some put their trust
in chariots, and some in horses, but we will remember the Name of the
Lord our God <span id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046.md) .’ And while He
was wor<span id="page_330">p. 330</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-Page_330"></span>shipped by the Patriarchs, concerning
the Angels it is written, ‘Let all the Angels of God worship Him <span
id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047.md) .’

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p32"></span>41. And if, as David says in the 71st
Psalm, ‘His Name remaineth before the sun, and before the moon, from one
generation to another <span id="fr_2048"></span>[2049](#fn_2048.md) ,’ how
did He receive what He had always, even before He now received it? or
how is He exalted, being before His exaltation the Most High? or how did
He receive the right of being worshipped, who before He now received it,
was ever worshipped? It is not a dark saying but a divine mystery <span
id="fr_2049"></span>[2050](#fn_2049.md) . ‘In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;’ but for our sakes
afterwards the ‘Word was made flesh <span
id="fr_2050"></span>[2051](#fn_2050.md) .’ And the term in question,
‘highly exalted,’ does not signify that the essence of the Word was
exalted, for He was ever and is ‘equal to God <span
id="fr_2051"></span>[2052](#fn_2051.md) ,’ but the exaltation is of the
manhood. Accordingly this is not said before the Word became flesh; that
it might be plain that ‘humbled’ and ‘exalted’ are spoken of His human
nature; for where there is humble estate, there too may be exaltation;
and if because of His taking flesh ‘humbled’ is written, it is clear
that ‘highly exalted’ is also said because of it. For of this was man’s
nature in want, because of the humble estate of the flesh and of death.
Since then the Word, being the Image of the Father and immortal, took
the form of the servant, and as man underwent for us death in His flesh,
that thereby He might offer Himself for us through death to the Father;
therefore also, as man, He is said because of us and for us to be highly
exalted, that as by His death we all died in Christ, so again in the
Christ Himself we might be highly exalted, being raised from the dead,
and ascending into heaven, ‘whither the forerunner Jesus is for us
entered, not into the figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now
to appear in the presence of God for us <span
id="fr_2052"></span>[2053](#fn_2052.md) .’ But if now for us the Christ is
entered into heaven itself, though He was even before and always Lord
and Framer of the heavens, for us therefore is that present exaltation
written. And as He Himself, who sanctifies all, says also that He
sanctifies Himself to the Father for our sakes, not that the Word may
become holy, but that He Himself may in Himself sanctify all of us, in
like manner we must take the present phrase, ‘He highly exalted Him,’
not that He Himself should be exalted, for He is the highest, but that
He may become righteousness for us <span
id="fr_2053"></span>[2054](#fn_2053.md) , and we may be exalted in Him, and
that we may enter the gates of heaven, which He has also opened for us,
the forerunners saying, ‘Lift up your gates, O ye rulers, and be ye lift
up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shall come in <span
id="fr_2054"></span>[2055](#fn_2054.md) .’ For here also not on Him were
shut the gates, as being Lord and Maker of all, but because of us is
this too written, to whom the door of paradise was shut. And therefore
in a human relation, because of the flesh which He bore, it is said of
Him, ‘Lift up your gates,’ and ‘shall come in,’ as if a man were
entering; but in a divine relation on the other hand it is said of Him,
since ‘the Word was God,’ that He is the ‘Lord’ and the ‘King of Glory.’
Such our exaltation the Spirit foreannounced in the eighty-ninth Psalm,
saying, ‘And in Thy righteousness shall they be exalted, for Thou art
the glory of their strength <span id="fr_2055"></span>[2056](#fn_2055.md)
.’ And if the Son be Righteousness, then He is not exalted as being
Himself in need, but it is we who are exalted in that Righteousness,
which is He <span id="fr_2056"></span>[2057](#fn_2056.md) .

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p42"></span>42. And so too the words ‘gave Him’
are not written because of the Word Himself; for even before He became
man He was worshipped, as we have said, by the Angels and the whole
creation in virtue of being proper to the Father; but because of us and
for us this too is written of Him. For as Christ died and was exalted as
man, so, as man, is He said to take what, as God, He ever had, that even
such a grant of grace might reach to us. For the Word was not impaired
in receiving a body, that He should seek to receive a grace, but rather
He deified that which He put on, and more than that, ‘gave’ it
graciously to the race of man. For as He was ever worshipped as being
the Word and existing in the form of God, so being what He ever was,
though become man and called Jesus, He none the less has the whole
creation under foot, and bending their knees to Him in this Name, and
confessing that the Word’s becoming flesh, and undergoing death in
flesh, has not happened against the glory of His Godhead, but ‘to the
glory of God the Father.’ For it is the Father’s glory that man, made
and then lost, should <span id="page_331">p. 331</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-Page_331"></span>be found again; and, when dead, that he
should be made alive, and should become God’s temple. For whereas the
powers in heaven, both Angels and Archangels, were ever worshipping the
Lord, as they are now worshipping Him in the Name of Jesus, this is our
grace and high exaltation, that even when He became man, the Son of God
is worshipped, and the heavenly powers will not be astonished at seeing
all of us, who are of one body with Him <span
id="fr_2057"></span>[2058](#fn_2057.md) , introduced into their realms. And
this had not been, unless He who existed in the form of God had taken on
Him a servant’s form, and had humbled Himself, yielding His body to come
unto death.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p44"></span>43. Behold then what men considered
the foolishness of God because of the Cross, has become of all things
most honoured. For our resurrection is stored up in it; and no longer
Israel alone, but henceforth all the nations, as the Prophet hath
foretold, leave their idols and acknowledge the true God, the Father of
the Christ. And the illusion of demons is come to nought, and He only
who is really God is worshipped in the Name of our Lord Jesus
Christ <span id="fr_2058"></span>[2059](#fn_2058.md) . For the fact that
the Lord, even when come in human body and called Jesus, was worshipped
and believed to be God’s Son, and that through Him the Father was known,
shows, as has been said, that not the Word, considered as the Word,
received this so great grace, but we. For because of our relationship to
His Body we too have become God’s temple, and in consequence are made
God’s sons, so that even in us the Lord is now worshipped, and beholders
report, as the Apostle says, that God is in them of a truth <span
id="fr_2059"></span>[2060](#fn_2059.md) . As also John says in the Gospel,
‘As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become children of
God <span id="fr_2060"></span>[2061](#fn_2060.md) ;’ and in his Epistle he
writes, ‘By this we know that He abideth in us by His Spirit which He
hath given us <span id="fr_2061"></span>[2062](#fn_2061.md) .’ And this too
is an evidence of His goodness towards us that, while we were exalted
because that the Highest Lord is in us, and on our account grace was
given to Him, because that the Lord who supplies the grace has become a
man like us, He on the other hand, the Saviour, humbled Himself in
taking ‘our body of humiliation <span
id="fr_2062"></span>[2063](#fn_2062.md) ,’ and took a servant’s form,
putting on that flesh which was enslaved to sin <span
id="fr_2063"></span>[2064](#fn_2063.md) . And He indeed has gained nothing
from us for His own promotion: for the Word of God is without want and
full; but rather we were promoted from Him; for He is the ‘Light, which
lighteneth every man, coming into the world <span
id="fr_2064"></span>[2065](#fn_2064.md) .’ And in vain do the Arians lay
stress upon the conjunction ‘wherefore,’ because Paul has said,
‘Wherefore, hath God highly exalted Him.’ For in saying this he did not
imply any prize of virtue, nor promotion from advance <span
id="fr_2065"></span>[2066](#fn_2065.md) , but the cause why the exaltation
was bestowed upon us. And what is this but that He who existed in form
of God, the Son of a noble <span id="fr_2066"></span>[2067](#fn_2066.md)
Father, humbled Himself and became a servant instead of us and in our
behalf? For if the Lord had not become man, we had not been redeemed
from sins, not raised from the dead, but remaining dead under the earth;
not exalted into heaven, but lying in Hades. Because of us then and in
our behalf are the words, ‘highly exalted’ and ‘given.’

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p54"></span>44. This then I consider the sense of
this passage, and that, a very ecclesiastical sense <span
id="fr_2067"></span>[2068](#fn_2067.md) . <span id="page_332">p. 332</span>
<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-Page_332"></span>However, there is another way in
which one might remark upon it, giving the same sense in a parallel way;
viz. that, though it does not speak of the exaltation of the Word
Himself, so far as He is Word <span id="fr_2068"></span>[2069](#fn_2068.md)
(for He is, as was just now said, most high and like His Father), yet by
reason of His becoming man it indicates His resurrection from the dead.
For after saying, ‘He hath humbled Himself even unto death,’ He
immediately added, ‘Wherefore He hath highly exalted Him;’ wishing to
shew, that, although as man He is said to have died, yet, as being Life,
He was exalted on the resurrection; for ‘He who descended, is the same
also who rose again <span id="fr_2069"></span>[2070](#fn_2069.md) .’ He
descended in body, and He rose again because He was God Himself in the
body. And this again is the reason why according to this meaning he
brought in the conjunction ‘Wherefore;’ not as a reward of virtue nor of
advancement, but to signify the cause why the resurrection took place;
and why, while all other men from Adam down to this time have died and
remained dead, He only rose in integrity from the dead. The cause is
this, which He Himself has already taught us, that, being God, He has
become man. For all other men, being merely born of Adam, died, and
death reigned over them; but He, the Second Man, is from heaven, for
‘the Word was made flesh <span id="fr_2070"></span>[2071](#fn_2070.md) ,’
and this Man is said to be from heaven and heavenly <span
id="fr_2071"></span>[2072](#fn_2071.md) , because the Word descended from
heaven; wherefore He was not held under death. For though He humbled
Himself, yielding His own Body to come unto death, in that it was
capable of death <span id="fr_2072"></span>[2073](#fn_2072.md) , yet He was
highly exalted from earth, because He was God’s Son in a body.
Accordingly what is here said, ‘Wherefore God also hath highly exalted
Him,’ answers to Peter’s words in the Acts, ‘Whom God raised up, having
loosed the bonds of death, because it was not possible that He should be
holden of it <span id="fr_2073"></span>[2074](#fn_2073.md) .’ For as Paul
has written, ‘Since being in form of God He became man, and humbled
Himself unto death, therefore God also hath highly exalted Him,’ so also
Peter says, ‘Since, being God, He became man, and signs and wonders
proved Him to beholders to be God, therefore it was not possible that He
should be holden of death.’ To man it was not possible to succeed in
this; for death belongs to man; wherefore, the Word, being God, became
flesh, that, being put to death in the flesh, He might quicken all men
by His own power.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p62"></span>45. But since He Himself is said to be
‘exalted,’ and God ‘gave’ Him, and the heretics think this a
defect <span id="fr_2074"></span>[2075](#fn_2074.md) or affection in the
essence <span id="fr_2075"></span>[2076](#fn_2075.md) of the Word, it
becomes necessary to explain how these words are used. He is said to be
exalted from the lower parts of the earth, because death is ascribed
even to Him. Both events are reckoned His, since it was His Body <span
id="fr_2076"></span>[2077](#fn_2076.md) , and none other’s, that was
exalted from the dead and taken up into heaven. And again, the Body
being His, and the Word not being external to it, it is natural that
when the Body was exalted, He, as man, should, because of the body, be
spoken of as exalted. If then He did not become man, let this not be
said of Him: but if the Word became flesh, of necessity the resurrection
and exaltation, as in the case of a man, must be ascribed to Him, that
the death which is ascribed to Him may be a redemption of the sin of men
and an abolition of death, and that the resurrection and exaltation may
for His sake remain secure for us. In both respects he hath said of Him,
‘God hath highly exalted Him,’ and ‘God hath given to Him;’ that herein
moreover he may show that it is not the Father that hath become flesh,
but it is His Word, who has become man, and receives after the manner of
men from the Father, and is exalted by Him, as has been said. And it is
plain, nor would any one <span id="page_333">p. 333</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-Page_333"></span>dispute it, that what the Father gives,
He gives through. the Son. And it is marvellous and overwhelming verily;
for the grace which the Son gives from the Father, that the Son Himself
is said to receive; and the exaltation, which the Son bestows from the
Father, with that the Son is Himself exalted. For He who is the Son of
God, became Himself the Son of Man; and, as Word, He gives from the
Father, for all things which the Father does and gives, He does and
supplies through Him; and as the Son of Man, He Himself is said after
the manner of men to receive what proceeds from Him, because His Body is

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p11"></span> The Arians perhaps more than other
heretics were remarkable for bringing objections against the received
view, rather than forming a consistent theory of their own. Indeed the
very vigour and success of their assault upon the truth lay in its being
a mere assault, not a positive and substantive teaching. They therefore,
even more than others, might fairly be urged on to the consequences of
their positions. Now the text in question, as it must be interpreted if
it is to serve as an objection, was an objection also to the received
doctrine of the Arians. They considered that our Lord was above and
before all creatures from the first, and their Creator; how then could
He be exalted above all? They surely, as much as Catholics, were obliged
to explain it of our Lord’s manhood. They could not then use it as a
weapon against the Church, until they took the ground of Paul of
Samosata.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p20"></span> In this passage Athan. considers that
the participation of the Word is deification, as communion with the Son
is adoption: also that the old Saints, inasmuch as they are called
‘gods’ and ‘sons,’ did partake of the Divine Word and Son, or in other
words were gifted with the Spirit. He asserts the same doctrine very
strongly in *Orat.* iv. §22. On the other hand, infr. 47, he says
expressly that Christ received the Spirit in Baptism ‘that He might give
it to man.’ There is no real contradiction in such statements; what was
given in one way under the Law, was given in another and fuller under
the Gospel.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p34"></span> Scripture is full of mysteries, but
they are mysteries of *fact,* not of words. Its dark sayings or ænigmata
are such, because in the nature of things they cannot be expressed
clearly. Hence contrariwise, *Orat.* ii. §77 fin. he calls <span

Sept. In like manner S. Ambrose says, Mare est scriptura divina, habens
in se sensus profundos, et altitudinem propheticorum *ænigmatum,* &c.
*Ep*. ii. 3. What is commonly called ‘explaining away’ Scripture, is
this transference of the obscurity from the subject to the words used.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p38"></span> When Scripture says that our Lord was
exalted, it means in that sense in which He could be exalted; just as,
in saying that a man walks or eats, we speak of him not as a spirit, but
as in that system of things to which the ideas of walking and eating
belong. Exaltation is not a word which can belong to God; it is
unmeaning, and *therefore* is *not* applied to Him in the text in
question. Thus, e.g. S. Ambrose: ‘Ubi humiliatus, ibi obediens. Ex eo
enim nascitur obedientia, ex quo humilitas *et in eo desinit,*’ &c. *Ap.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p50"></span> It was usual to say against the
Apollinarians, that, unless our Lord took on Him our nature, *as it is,*
He had not purified and changed it, as it is, but another nature; ‘The
Lord came not to save Adam as free from sin, that He should become like
unto him; but as, in the net of sin and now fallen, that God’s mercy
might raise him up with Christ.’ Leont. *contr. Nestor.* &c. ii. p. 996.
Accordingly, Athan. says elsewhere, ‘Had not sinlessness appeared \[cf.
[Rom. viii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p50.2"></span>, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p50.4"></span>πέμψας</span>\] “in the nature which had
sinned,” how was sin condemned in the flesh?’ in *Apoll.* ii. 6. ‘It was
necessary for our salvation,’ says S. Cyril, ‘that the Word of God
should become man, that human flesh “subject to corruption” and “sick
with the lust of pleasures,” He might make His own; and, “whereas He is
life and lifegiving,” He might “destroy the corruption,” &c.…For by this
means, might sin in our flesh become dead.’ Ep. ad *Success.* i. p. 138.
And S. Leo, ‘Non alterius naturæ erat ejus caro quam nostra, nec alio
illi quam cæteris hominibus anima est inspirata principio, quæ
excelleret, non diversitate generis, sed sublimitate virtutis.’ *Ep.* 35
fin. vid. also *Ep.* 28. 3. *Ep.* 31. 2. *Ep.* 165. 9. *Serm.* 22. 2.
and 25. 5. It may be asked whether this doctrine does not interfere with
that of the immaculate conception \[i.e. that *Christ* was conceived
sinless\]; but that miracle was wrought in order that our Lord might not
be born in original sin, and does not affect, or rather includes, His
taking flesh of the substance of the Virgin, i.e. of a fallen nature. If
indeed sin were ‘of the substance’ of our fallen nature, as some
heretics have said, then He could not have taken our nature without
partaking our sinfulness; but if sin be, as it is, a fault of the
*will,* then the Divine Power of the Word could sanctify the human will,
and keep it from swerving in the direction of evil. Hence ‘We say not
that Christ by the felicity of a flesh separated from sense *could not*
feel the desire of sin, but that by perfection of virtue, and by a flesh
not begotten through concupiscence of the flesh, He *had not* the desire
of sin;’ Aug. *Op. Imperf.* iv. 48. On the other hand, S. Athanasius
expressly calls it Manichean doctrine to consider <span

the flesh <span class="Greek"><span

i. 14 fin. His argument in the next ch. is on the ground that all
*natures* are from God, but God made man upright nor is the author of
evil (vid. also *Vit. Anton*. 20); ‘not as if,’ he says, ‘the devil
wrought in man a nature (God forbid!) for of a nature the evil cannot be
maker (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p50.13"></span>δημιουργὸς</span>) as is the impiety of
the Manichees, but he wrought a bias of nature by transgression, and ‘so
death reigned over all men.’ Wherefore, saith he, ‘the Son of God came
to destroy the works of the devil;’ what works? that nature, which God
made sinless, and the devil biassed to the transgression of God’s
command and the finding out of sin which is death, did God the Word
raise again, so as to be secure from the devil’s bias and the finding
out of sin. And therefore the Lord said, “The prince of this world
cometh and findeth nothing in Me.”’ vid. also §19. Ibid. ii. 6. he
speaks of the devil having ‘introduced the *law* of sin.’ vid. also §9.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p60"></span> It was a point in controversy with
the extreme Monophysites, that is, the Eutychians, whether our Lord’s
body was naturally subject to death, the Catholics maintaining the
affirmative, as Athanasius here. Eutyches asserted that our Lord had not
a human nature, by which he meant among other things that His manhood
was not subject to the *laws* of a body, but so far as He submitted to
them, He did so by an act of will in each particular case; and this,
lest it should seem that He was moved by the <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p60.2"></span>πάθη</span> against His will <span
class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p60.4"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p60.5"></span>κουσίως</span>; and
consequently that His manhood was not subject to death. But the
Catholics maintained that He had voluntarily placed Himself *under*
those laws, and died *naturally,* vid. Athan. *contr. Apol.* i. 17, and
that after the resurrection His body became incorruptible, not according
to nature, but by grace. vid. Leont. *de Sect.* x. p. 530. Anast.
*Hodeg.* c. 23. To express their doctrine of the <span

Lord’s manhood the Eutychians made use of the Catholic expression ‘ut
voluit.’ vid. Athan. l.c. Eutyches *ap. Leon. Ep.* 21. ‘quomodo voluit

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p64"></span> At first sight it would seem as if S.
Athanasius here used <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p64.2"></span>οὐσία</span> *essence* for subsistence, or
person; but this is not true except with an explanation. Its *direct*
meaning is here, as usual, essence, though *indirectly* it comes to
imply subsistence. He is speaking of that Divine Essence which, though
also the Almighty Father’s, is as simply and entirely the Word’s as if
it were only His. Nay, even when the Essence of the Father is spoken of
in a sort of contrast to that of the Son, as in the phrase <span
class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p64.5"></span>οὐσία ἐξ
οὐσίας</span>, harsh as such expressions are, it is not accurate to say
that <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p64.7"></span>οὐσία</span> is used for subsistence or
person, or that two <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p64.9"></span>οὐσίαι</span> are spoken of (vid. *de
Syn.* 52, note 8), except, that is, by Arians, as Eusebius, supr. *Ep.
Eus.* §6 \[or by Origen, Prolegg. ii. §3 (2) a.\] Just below we find

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p65"></span> This was the question which came into
discussion in the Nestorian controversy, when, as it was then expressed,
all that took place in respect to the Eternal Word as man, belonged to
His *Person,* and therefore might be predicated of Him; so that it was
heretical not to confess the Word’s body (or the body of God in the
Person of the Word), the Word’s death (as Athan, in the text), the
Word’s exaltation, and the Word’s, or God’s, Mother, who was in
consequence called <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.xi-p65.2"></span>θεοτόκος</span>, which was the expression
on which the controversy mainly turned. Cf. *Orat.* iii. 31, a passage
as precise as if it had been written after the Nestorian and Eutychian
controversies, though without the technical words then adopted.

[Next: Texts Explained; Secondly, Psalm xlv. 7, 8. Whether the words
'therefore,' 'anointed,' &c., imply that the Word has been rewarded.
Argued against first from the word 'fellows' or 'partakers.' He is
anointed with the Spirit in His manhood to sanctify human nature.
Therefore the Spirit descended on Him in Jordan, when in the flesh. And
He is said to sanctify Himself for us, and give us the glory He has
received. The word 'wherefore' implies His divinity. 'Thou hast loved
righteousness,' &c., do not imply trial or choice.](2040357.md)
