<span id="xvi.ii.xliii-p1"></span> 91. But he, knowing the custom, and
fearing that his body would be treated this way, hastened, and having
bidden farewell to the monks in the outer mountain entered the inner
mountain, where he was accustomed to abide. And after a few months he
fell sick. Having summoned those who were there—they were two in number
who had remained in the mountain fifteen years, practising the
discipline and attending on Antony on account of his age—he said to
them, ‘I, as it is written <span id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142) ,
go the way of the fathers, for I perceive that I am called by the Lord.
And do you be watchful and destroy not your long discipline, but as
though now making a beginning, zealously preserve your determination.
For ye know the treachery of the demons, how fierce they are, but how
little power they have. Wherefore fear them not, but rather ever breathe
Christ, and trust Him. Live as though dying daily. Give heed to
yourselves, and remember the admonition you have heard from me. Have no
fellowship with the schismatics, nor any dealings at all with the
heretical Arians. For you know how I shunned them on account of their
hostility to Christ, and the strange doctrines of their heresy.
Therefore be the more earnest always to be followers first of God and
then of the Saints; that after death they also may receive you as
well-known friends into the eternal habitations. Ponder over these
things and think of them, and if you have any care for me and are
mindful of me as of a father, suffer no one to take my body into Egypt,
lest haply they place me in the houses <span
id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143) , for to avoid this I entered into
the mountain and came here. Moreover you know how I always put to rebuke
those who had this custom, and exhorted them to cease from it. Bury my
body, therefore, and hide it underground yourselves, and let my words be
observed by you that no one may know the place <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144) but you alone. For at the
resurrection of the dead I shall receive it incorruptible from the
Saviour. And divide my garments. To Athanasius the bishop give one
sheepskin and the garment whereon I am laid, which he himself gave me
new, but which with me has grown old. To Serapion the bishop give the
other sheepskin, and keep the hair garment yourselves <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145) . For the rest fare ye well, my
children, for Antony is departing, and is with you no more.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xliii-p4"></span> The body of Antony was discovered ‘by
a revelation’ in 561, and translated to Alexandria. When the Saracens
conquered Egypt it was transferred to Constantinople, and lastly in the
tenth century was carried to Vienne by a French Seigneur. The first and
last links of this history are naturally precarious. The translation to
Alexandria is vouched for by Victor of Tunis (*Chron.*) who was in the
neighbourhood at the time.

<span id="xvi.ii.xliii-p5"></span> Jerome, in his life of Paul of
Thebes, relates that Antony received from Paul, and ever afterwards wore
on festivals, his tunic of palm-leaves. If this ‘legacy more glorious
than the purple of a king’ (*Vit. Paul.* c. 13) had any existence, it
would certainly not have been forgotten by Antony in disposing of his
worldly goods. The silence of the Life of Antony throws discredit on
Jerome’s whole account of Paul.
