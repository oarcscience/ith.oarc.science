<span id="xix.ii.xi-p1"></span> 11. *Examples of Scripture Saints in
defence of flight.*

<span id="xix.ii.xi-p2"></span>Perhaps they have not read these
histories; as being out of date; yet have they no recol<span

of what is written in the Gospel? For the disciples also withdrew and
hid themselves for fear of the Jews; and Paul, when he was sought after
by the governor at Damascus, was let down from the wall in a basket, and
so escaped his hands. As the Scripture then relates these things of the
Saints, what excuse will they be able to invent for their wickedness? To
reproach them with cowardice would be an act of madness, and to accuse
them of acting contrary to the will of God, would be to shew themselves
entirely ignorant of the Scriptures. For there was a command under the
law <span id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) that cities of refuge
should be appointed, in order that they who were sought after to be put
to death, might at least have some means of saving themselves. And when
He Who spake unto Moses, the Word of the Father, appeared in the end of
the world, He also gave this commandment, saying, ‘But when they
persecute you in this city, flee ye into another:’ and shortly after He
says, ‘When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken
of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (whoso readeth, let
him understand); then let them which be in Judæa flee into the
mountains: let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any
thing out of his house: neither let him which is in the field return
back to take his clothes <span id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md) .’
Knowing these things, the Saints regulated their conduct accordingly.
For what our Lord has now commanded, the same also He spoke by His
Saints before His coming in the flesh: and this is the rule which is
given unto men to lead them to perfection—what God commands, that to do.
