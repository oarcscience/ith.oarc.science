<span id="xxi.ii.vi.ii-p1"></span> *§§6, 7. When the Word and Son
hungered, wept, and was wearied, He acted as our Mediator, taking on Him
what was ours, that He might impart to us what was His.*

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.ii-p2"></span>6. But in answer to the weak and human
notion of the Arians, their supposing that the Lord is in want, when He
says, ‘Is given unto Me,’ and ‘I received,’ and if Paul says, ‘Wherefore
He highly exalted Him,’ and ‘He set Him at the right hand <span
id="fr_3303"></span>[3304](#fn_3303.md) ,’ and the like, we must say that
our Lord, being Word and Son of God, bore a body, and became Son of Man,
that, having become Mediator between God, and men, He might minister the
things of God to us, and ours to God. When then He is said to hunger and
weep and weary, and to cry Eloi, Eloi, which are our human affections,
He receives them from us and offers to the Father <span
id="fr_3304"></span>[3305](#fn_3304.md) , interceding for us, that in Him
they may be annulled <span id="fr_3305"></span>[3306](#fn_3305.md) . And
when it is said, ‘All power is given unto Me,’ and ‘I received,’ and
‘Wherefore God highly exalted Him,’ these are gifts given from God to us
through Him. For the Word was never in want <span
id="fr_3306"></span>[3307](#fn_3306.md) , nor has come into being <span
id="fr_3307"></span>[3308](#fn_3307.md) ; nor again were men sufficient to
minister these things for themselves, but through the Word they are
given to us; therefore, as if given to Him, they are imparted to us. For
this was the reason of His becoming man, that, as being given to Him,
they might pass on to us <span id="fr_3308"></span>[3309](#fn_3308.md) .
For of such gifts mere man had not become worthy; and again the mere
Word had not needed them <span id="fr_3309"></span>[3310](#fn_3309.md) ;
the Word then was united to us, and then imparted to us power, and
highly exalted us <span id="fr_3310"></span>[3311](#fn_3310.md) . For the
Word being in man, highly exalted man himself; and, when the Word was in
man, man himself received. Since then, the Word being in flesh, man
himself was exalted, and received power, therefore these things are
referred to the Word, since they were given on His account; for on
account of the Word in man were these gifts given. And as ‘the Word
became flesh <span id="fr_3311"></span>[3312](#fn_3311.md) ,’ so also man
himself received the gifts which came through the Word. For all that man
himself has received, the Word is said to have received <span
id="fr_3312"></span>[3313](#fn_3312.md) ; that it might be shewn, that man
himself, being unworthy to receive, as far as his own nature is
concerned, yet has received because of the Word become flesh. Wherefore
if anything be said to be given to the Lord, or the like, we must
consider that it is given, not to Him as needing it, but to man himself
through the Word. For every one interceding for another, receives the
gift in his own person, not as needing, but on his account for whom he
intercedes.

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.ii-p13"></span>7. For as He takes our infirmities,
not being infirm <span id="fr_3313"></span>[3314](#fn_3313.md) , and
hungers not hungering, but sends up what is ours that it may be
abolished, so the gifts which come from God instead of our infirmities,
doth He too Himself receive, that man, being united to Him, may be able
to partake them. Hence it is that the Lord says, ‘All things whatsoever
Thou hast given Me, I have given them,’ and again, ‘I pray for
them <span id="fr_3314"></span>[3315](#fn_3314.md) .’ For He prayed for us,
taking on Him what is ours, and He was giving what He received. Since
then, the Word being united to man himself, the Father, regarding Him,
<span id="page_436">p. 436</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.vi.ii-Page_436"></span>vouchsafed to man to be exalted, to
have all power and the like; therefore are referred to the Word Himself,
and are as if given to Him, all things which through Him we receive. For
as He for our sake became man, so we for His sake are exalted. It is no
absurdity then, if, as for our sake He humbled Himself, so also for our
sake He is said to be highly exalted. So ‘He gave to Him,’ that is, ‘to
us for His sake;’ ‘and He highly exalted Him <span
id="fr_3315"></span>[3316](#fn_3315.md) ,’ that is, ‘us in Him.’ And the
Word Himself, when we are exalted, and receive, and are succoured, as if
He Himself were exalted and received and were succoured, gives thanks to
the Father, referring what is ours to Himself, and saying, ‘All things,
whatsoever Thou hast given Me, I have given unto them <span
id="fr_3316"></span>[3317](#fn_3316.md) .’
