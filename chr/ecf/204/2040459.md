id="xxv.iii.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXII</span>.—*To John and
Antiochus*. <span id="fr_4796"></span>[4797](#fn_4796)

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xvii-p3"></span>Athanasius to John and Antiochus,
our beloved sons and fellow-presbyters in the Lord, greeting.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xvii-p4"></span>I was glad to receive your letter
just now, the more so as you wrote from Jerusalem. I thank you for
informing me about the brethren that there assembled, and about those
who wish, on account of disputed points, to disturb the simple. But
about these things let the Apostle charge them not to give heed to those
who contend about words, and seek nothing else than to tell and hear
some new thing <span id="fr_4797"></span>[4798](#fn_4797) . But do you,
having your foundation sure, even <span id="page_580">p. 580</span>
<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xvii-Page_580"></span>Jesus Christ our Lord, and
the confession of the fathers concerning the faith, avoid those who wish
to say anything more or less than that, and rather aim at the profit of
the brethren, that they may fear God and keep His commandments, in order
that both by the teaching of the fathers, and by the keeping of the
commandments, they may be able to appear well-pleasing to the Lord in
the day of judgment. But I have been utterly astonished at the boldness
of those who venture to speak against our beloved Basil the bishop, a
true servant of God. For from such vain talk they can be convicted of
not loving even the confession of the fathers.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xvii-p6"></span>Greet the brethren. They that are
with me greet you. I pray that ye may be well in the Lord, beloved and
much-desired sons.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xvii-p2"></span> Of John and Antiochus nothing is
known, unless the latter is the later bishop of Ptolemais and enemy of
Chrysostom. Both men seem to belong to the class of well-meaning
mischief-makers, given to retailing invidious stories. Hence the polite
reserve of our little note (Migne xxvi. 115, and its laconic dismissal
of the gossip about Basil, the new bishop of the Cappadocian Cæsarea
(*supr.* p. 449). The main interest of this and the following letter,
which seem to date from the winter 371–372, consists in the testimony of
the high esteem of Athanasius for Basil, as well as his indifference to
words where no essential principle was involved. The two recipients of
this letter either lived or were visitors at Jerusalem. On Basil’s
difficulties at this time, see D.C.B. i. 288 a, 293, and on his
relations with Athan., cf. Prolegg. ch. ii. §10.
