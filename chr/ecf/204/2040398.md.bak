id="xxiii.ii-p1.1"></span>Tome or Synodal Letter to the People of
Antioch.</span>

<span id="xxiii.ii-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xxiii.ii-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxiii.ii-p3.1"></span>To</span> our beloved and much-desired
fellow-ministers Eusebius <span id="fr_3673"></span>[3674](#fn_3673.md) ,
Lucifer <span id="fr_3674"></span>[3675](#fn_3674.md) , Asterius <span
id="fr_3675"></span>[3676](#fn_3675.md) , Kymatius, and Anatolius,
Athanasius and the bishops present in Alexandria from Italy and Arabia,
Egypt and Libya; Eusebius, Asterius, Gaius, Agathus, Ammonius,
Agathodæmon, Dracontius, Adelphius, Hermæon, Marcus, Theodorus, Andreas,
Paphnutius, another Marcus, Zoilus, Menas, George, Lucius, Macarius and
the rest, all greeting in Christ.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p7"></span>We are persuaded that being ministers of
God and good stewards ye are sufficient to order the affairs of the
Church in every respect. But since it has come to us, that many who were
formerly separated from us by jealousy now wish for peace, while many
also having severed their connection with the Arian madmen are desiring
our communion, we think it well to write to your courtesy what ourselves
and the beloved Eusebius and Asterius have drawn up: yourselves being
our beloved and truly most-desired fellow-ministers. We rejoice at the
said tidings, and pray that even if any be left still far from us, and
if any appear to be in agreement with the Arians, he may promptly leave
their madness, so that for the future all men everywhere may say, ‘One
Lord, one faith <span id="fr_3676"></span>[3677](#fn_3676.md) .’ For as the
psalmist says, what is so good or pleasant as for brethren to dwell in
unity <span id="fr_3677"></span>[3678](#fn_3677.md) . But our dwelling is
the Church, and our mind ought to be the same. For thus we believe that
the Lord also will dwell with us, who says, ‘I will dwell with them and
walk in them <span id="fr_3678"></span>[3679](#fn_3678.md) ’ and ‘Here will
I dwell for I have a delight therein <span
id="fr_3679"></span>[3680](#fn_3679.md) .’ But by ‘here’ what is meant but
there where one faith and religion is preached?

<span id="xxiii.ii-p12"></span>2. *Mission of Eusebius and Asterius.*

<span id="xxiii.ii-p13"></span>We then of Egypt truly wished to go to
you along with our beloved Eusebius and Asterius, for many reasons, but
chiefly that we might embrace your affection and together enjoy the said
peace and concord. But since, as we declared in our other letters, and
as ye may learn from our fellow-ministers, the needs of the church
detain us, with much regret we begged the same fellow-ministers of ours,
Eusebius and Asterius, to go to you in our stead. And we thank their
piety in that although they might have gone at once to their dioceses,
they preferred to go to you at all costs, on account of the pressing
need of the Church. They therefore having consented, we consoled
ourselves with the consideration that you and they being there, we all
were present with you in mind.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p14"></span>3. *The ‘Meletians’ to be acknowledged,
and all who renounce heresy, especially as to the Holy Spirit.*

<span id="xxiii.ii-p15"></span>As many then as desire peace with us, and
specially those who assemble in the Old \[Church\] <span
id="fr_3680"></span>[3681](#fn_3680.md) and those again who are seceding
<span id="page_484">p. 484</span> <span
id="xxiii.ii-Page_484"></span>from the Arians, do ye call to yourselves,
and receive them as parents their sons, and welcome them as tutors and
guardians; and unite them to our beloved Paulinus and his people,
without requiring more from them than to anathematise the Arian heresy
and confess the faith confessed by the holy fathers at Nicæa, and to
anathematise also those who say that the Holy Spirit is a Creature and
separate from the Essence of Christ. For this is in truth a complete
renunciation of the abominable heresy of the Arians, to refuse to divide
the Holy Trinity, or to say that any part of it is a creature. For those
who, while pretending to cite the faith confessed at Nicæa, venture to
blaspheme the Holy Spirit, do nothing more than in words deny the Arian
heresy while they retain it in thought. But let the impiety of Sabellius
and of Paul of Samosata also be anathematised by all, and the madness of
Valentinian and Basilides, and the folly of the Manichæans. For if this
be done, all evil suspicion will be removed on all hands, and the faith
of the Catholic Church alone be exhibited in purity.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p17"></span>4. *The parties at Antioch to unite.*

<span id="xxiii.ii-p18"></span>But that we, and they who have ever
remained in communion with us, hold this faith, we think no one of
yourselves nor any one else is ignorant. But since we rejoice with all
those who desire re-union, but especially with those that assemble in
the Old \[church\], and as we glorify the Lord exceedingly, as for all
things so especially for the good purpose of these men, we exhort you
that concord be established with them on these terms, and, as we said
above, without further conditions, without namely any further demand
upon yourselves on the part of those who assemble in the Old \[church\],
or Paulinus and his fellows propounding anything else, or aught beyond
the Nicene definition.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p19"></span>5. *The creed of Sardica not an
authorised formula. Question of ‘hypostasis.’*

<span id="xxiii.ii-p20"></span>And prohibit even the reading or
publication of the paper, much talked of by some, as having been drawn
up concerning the Faith at the synod of Sardica. For the synod made no
definition of the kind. For whereas some demanded, on the ground that
the Nicene synod was defective, the drafting of a creed, and in their
haste even attempted it <span id="fr_3681"></span>[3682](#fn_3681.md) , the
holy synod assembled in Sardica was indignant, and decreed that no
statement of faith should be drafted, but that they should be content
with the Faith confessed by the fathers at Nicæa, inasmuch as it lacked
nothing but was full of piety, and that it was undesirable for a second
creed to be promulged, lest that drafted at Nicæa should be deemed
imperfect, and a pretext be given to those who were often wishing to
draft and define a creed. So that if a man propound the above or any
other paper, stop them, and persuade them rather to keep the peace. For
in such men we perceive no motive save only contentiousness. For as to
those whom some were blaming for speaking of three Subsistences <span
id="fr_3682"></span>[3683](#fn_3682.md) , on the ground that the phrase is
unscriptural and therefore suspicious, we thought it right indeed to
require nothing beyond the confession of Nicæa, but on account of the
contention we made enquiry of them, whether they meant, like the Arian
madmen, subsistences foreign and strange, and alien in essence from one
another, and that each Subsistence was divided apart by itself, as is
the case with creatures in general and in particular with those begotten
of men, or like different substances, such as gold, silver, or brass;—or
whether, like other heretics, they meant three Beginnings and three
Gods, by speaking of three Subsistences.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p23"></span>They assured us in reply that they
neither meant this nor had ever held it. But upon our asking them ‘what
then do you mean by it, or why do you use such expressions?’ they
replied, Because they believed in a Holy Trinity, not a trinity in name
only, but existing and subsisting in truth, ‘both a Father truly
existing and subsisting, and a Son truly substantial and subsisting, and
a Holy Spirit subsisting and really existing do we acknowledge,’ and
that neither had they said there were three Gods or three beginnings,
nor would they at all tolerate such as said or held so, but that they
acknowledged a Holy Trinity but One Godhead, and one Beginning, and that
the Son is coessential with the Father, as the fathers said; while the
Holy Spirit is not a creature, nor external, but proper to and
inseparable from the Essence of the Father and the Son.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p24"></span>6. *The question of one Subsistence
(Hypostasis) or three, not to be pressed.*

<span id="xxiii.ii-p25"></span>Having accepted then these men’s
interpretation and defence of their language, we made enquiry of those
blamed by them for speaking of One Subsistence, whether they use the
expression in the sense of Sabellius, to the nega<span id="page_485">p.
485</span> <span id="xxiii.ii-Page_485"></span>tion of the Son and the
Holy Spirit, or as though the Son were non-substantial, or the Holy
Spirit impersonal <span id="fr_3683"></span>[3684](#fn_3683.md) . But they
in their turn assured us that they neither meant this nor had ever held
it, but ‘we use the word Subsistence thinking it the same thing to say
Subsistence or Essence;’ ‘But we hold that there is One, because the Son
is of the Essence of the Father, and because of the identity of nature.
For we believe that there is one Godhead, and that it has one nature,
and not that there is one nature of the Father, from which that of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit are distinct.’ Well, thereupon they who had
been blamed for saying there were three Subsistences agreed with the
others, while those who had spoken of One Essence, also confessed the
doctrine of the former as interpreted by them. And by both sides Arius
was anathematised as an adversary of Christ, and Sabellius, and Paul of
Samosata, as impious men, and Valentinus and Basilides as aliens from
the truth, and Manichæus as an inventor of mischief. And all, by God’s
grace, and after the above explanations, agree together that the faith
confessed by the fathers at Nicæa is better than the said phrases, and
that for the future they would prefer to be content to use its language.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p27"></span>7. *The human Nature of Christ complete,
not Body only.*

<span id="xxiii.ii-p28"></span>But since also certain seemed to be
contending together concerning the fleshly Economy of the Saviour, we
enquired of both parties. And what the one confessed, the others also
agreed to, that the Word did not, as it came to the prophets, so dwell
in a holy man at the consummation of the ages, but that the Word Himself
was made flesh, and being in the Form of God, took the form of a
servant <span id="fr_3684"></span>[3685](#fn_3684.md) , and from Mary after
the flesh became man for us, and that thus in Him the human race is
perfectly and wholly delivered from sin and quickened from the dead, and
given access to the kingdom of the heavens. For they confessed also that
the Saviour had not a body without a soul, nor without sense or
intelligence; for it was not possible, when the Lord had become man for
us, that His body should be without intelligence: nor was the salvation
effected in the Word Himself a salvation of body only, but of soul also.
And being Son of God in truth, He became also Son of Man, and being
God’s Only-begotten Son, He became also at the same time ‘firstborn
among many brethren <span id="fr_3685"></span>[3686](#fn_3685.md) .’
Wherefore neither was there one Son of God before Abraham, another after
Abraham <span id="fr_3686"></span>[3687](#fn_3686.md) : nor was there one
that raised up Lazarus, another that asked concerning him; but the same
it was that said as man, ‘Where does Lazarus lie <span
id="fr_3687"></span>[3688](#fn_3687.md) ;’ and as God raised him up: the
same that as man and in the body spat, but divinely as Son of God opened
the eyes of the man blind from his birth <span
id="fr_3688"></span>[3689](#fn_3688.md) ; and while, as Peter says <span
id="fr_3689"></span>[3690](#fn_3689.md) , in the flesh He suffered, as God
opened the tomb and raised the dead. For which reasons, thus
understanding all that is said in the Gospel, they assured us that they
held the same truth about the Word’s Incarnation and becoming Man.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p35"></span>8. *Questions of words must not be
suffered to divide those who think alike.*

<span id="xxiii.ii-p36"></span>These things then being thus confessed,
we exhort you not hastily to condemn those who so confess, and so
explain the phrases they use, nor to reject them, but rather to accept
them as they desire peace and defend themselves, while you check and
rebuke, as of suspicious views, those who refuse so to confess and to
explain their language. But while you refuse toleration to the latter,
counsel the others also who explain and hold aright, not to enquire
further into each other’s opinions, nor to fight about words to no
useful purpose, nor to go on contending with the above phrases, but to
agree in the mind of piety. For they who are not thus minded, but only
stir up strife with such petty phrases, and seek something beyond what
was drawn up at Nicæa, do nothing except ‘give their neighbour turbid
confusion to drink <span id="fr_3690"></span>[3691](#fn_3690.md) ,’ like
men who grudge peace and love dissensions. But do ye, as good men and
faithful servants and stewards of the Lord, stop and check what gives
offence and is strange, and value above all things peace of that kind,
faith being sound. Perhaps God will have pity on us, and unite what is
divided, and, there being once more one flock <span
id="fr_3691"></span>[3692](#fn_3691.md) , we shall all have one leader,
even our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p39"></span>9. *The above terms unanimously agreed
upon.*

<span id="xxiii.ii-p40"></span>These things, albeit there was no need to
require anything beyond the synod of Nicæa, nor to tolerate the language
of contention, yet for the sake of peace, and to prevent the rejection
of men who wish to believe aright, we enquired into. And what they
confessed, we put briefly into writing, we namely who are left in
Alexandria, in common <span id="page_486">p. 486</span> <span
id="xxiii.ii-Page_486"></span>with our fellow-ministers, Asterius and
Eusebius. For most of us had gone away to our dioceses. But do you on
your part read this in public where you are wont to assemble, and be
pleased to invite all to you thither. For it is right that the letter
should be there first read, and that there those who desire and strive
for peace should be re-united. And then, when they are re-united, in the
spot where all the laity think best, in the presence of your courtesy,
the public assemblies should be held, and the Lord be glorified by all
together. The brethren who are with me greet you. I pray that you may be
well, and remember us to the Lord; both I, Athanasius, and likewise the
other bishops assembled, sign, and those sent by Lucifer, bishop of the
island of Sardinia, two deacons, Herennius and Agapetus; and from
Paulinus, Maximus and Calemerus, deacons also. And there were present
certain monks of Apolinarius <span id="fr_3692"></span>[3693](#fn_3692.md)
the bishop, sent from him for the purpose.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p42"></span>10. *Signatures.*

<span id="xxiii.ii-p43"></span>The names of the several bishops to whom
the letter is addressed are: Eusebius of the city of Virgilli in
Gaul <span id="fr_3693"></span>[3694](#fn_3693.md) , Lucifer of the island
of Sardinia, Asterius of Petra, Arabia, Kymatius of Paltus, Cœle-Syria,
Anatolius of Eubœa.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p45"></span>Senders: the Pope Athanasius, and those
present with him in Alexandria, viz.: Eusebius, Asterius, and the others
above-mentioned, Gaius of Paratonium <span
id="fr_3694"></span>[3695](#fn_3694.md) in Hither Libya, Agathus of
Phragonis and part of Elearchia in Egypt, Ammonius of Pachnemunis <span
id="fr_3695"></span>[3696](#fn_3695.md) and the rest of Elearchia,
Agathodæmon of Schedia <span id="fr_3696"></span>[3697](#fn_3696.md) and
Menelaitas, Dracontius of Lesser Hermupolis, Adelphius of Onuphis <span
id="fr_3697"></span>[3698](#fn_3697.md) in Lychni, Hermion of Tanes <span
id="fr_3698"></span>[3699](#fn_3698.md) , Marcus of Zygra <span
id="fr_3699"></span>[3700](#fn_3699.md) , Hither Libya, Theodorus of
Athribis <span id="fr_3700"></span>[3701](#fn_3700.md) , Andreas of
Arsenoe, Paphnutius of Sais, Marcus of Philæ, Zoilus of Andrôs <span
id="fr_3701"></span>[3702](#fn_3701.md) , Menas of Antiphra <span
id="fr_3702"></span>[3703](#fn_3702.md) .

<span id="xxiii.ii-p55"></span>Eusebius also signs the following in
Latin, of which the translation is:

<span id="xxiii.ii-p56"></span>I Eusebius, according to your exact
confession made on either side by agreement concerning the Subsistences,
also add my agreement; further concerning the Incarnation of our
Saviour, namely that the Son of God has become Man, taking everything
upon Himself without sin, like the composition of our old man, I ratify
the text of the letter. And whereas the Sardican paper is ruled out, to
avoid the appearance of issuing anything beyond the creed of Nicæa, I
also add my consent, in order that the creed of Nicæa may not seem by it
to be excluded, and \[I agree\] that it should not be published. I pray
for your health in the Lord.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p57"></span>I Asterius agree to what is above
written, and pray for your health in the Lord.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p58"></span>11. *The ‘Tome’ signed at Antioch.*

<span id="xxiii.ii-p59"></span>And after this Tome was sent off from
Alexandria, thus signed by the aforesaid, \[the recipients\] in their
turn signed it:

<span id="xxiii.ii-p60"></span>I Paulinus hold thus, as I received from
the fathers, that the Father perfectly exists and subsists, and that the
Son perfectly subsists, and that the Holy Spirit perfectly subsists.
Wherefore also I accept the above explanation concerning the Three
Subsistences, and the one Subsistence, or rather Essence, and those who
hold thus. For it is pious to hold and confess the Holy Trinity in one
Godhead. And concerning the Word of the Father becoming Man for us, I
hold as it is written, that, as John says, the Word was made Flesh, not
in the sense of those most impious persons who say that He has undergone
a change, but that He has become Man for us, being born of the holy
Virgin Mary and of the Holy Spirit. For the Saviour had a body neither
without soul, nor without sense, nor without intelligence. For it were
impossible, the Lord being made Man for us, that His body should be
without intelligence. Wherefore I anathematise those who set aside the
Faith confessed at Nicæa, and who do not say that the Son is of the
Father’s Essence, and coessential with the Father. Moreover I
anathematise those who say that the Holy Spirit is a Creature made
through the Son. Once more I anathematise the heresy of Sabellius and of
Photinus <span id="fr_3703"></span>[3704](#fn_3703.md) , and every heresy,
walking in the Faith of Nicæa, and in all that is above written. I
Karterius <span id="fr_3704"></span>[3705](#fn_3704.md) pray for your
health.
