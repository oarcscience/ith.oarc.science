Athanasius</span>

<span id="v.iii.i-p3"></span>§1. <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p3.1"></span>It</span> will be attempted to give a complete
list of his writings in chronological order; those included in this

id="v.iii.i-p4.24"></span>Ad Luciferum</span> (Letters 50, 51). (22)
Id.? <span class="c10"><span id="v.iii.i-p4.25"></span>Ad
Serapionem</span> Orationes IV. (Migne xxvi. 529, *sqq*.). These <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.i-p4.26"></span>λόγοι</span> or dogmatic
letters are the most important work omitted in the present volume.
Serapion of Thmuis, who appears from the silence respecting him in the
lists of exiles to have escaped banishment in 356–7, reported to
Athanasius the growth of the doctrine that, while the Son was
co-essential with the Father, the Spirit was merely a creature superior
to Angels. Athanasius replied in a long dogmatic letter, upon receiving
which Serapion was begged to induce the author to abridge it for the
benefit of the simple. After some hesitation Athanasius sent two more
letters, the second drawing out the proofs of the Godhead of the Son,
the third restating more concisely the argument of the first. The
objections by which these letters were met were replied to in a fourth
letter which Athanasius declared to be his last word. The persons
combated are not the Macedonians, who only formed a party on this
question at a later date, and whose position was not quite that combated
in these letters. Athanasius calls them <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p4.27"></span>Τροπικοί</span>, or ‘Figurists<span
class="c10"><span id="v.iii.i-p4.28"></span>,’</span> from the sense in
which they understood passages of Scripture which seemed to deify the
Holy Spirit. It is not within our compass to summarise the treatises,
but it may be noted that Ath. argues that where <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.i-p4.29"></span>πνεῦμα</span> is absolute
or anarthrous in Scripture it never refers to the Holy Spirit unless the
context already supplies such reference (i. 4, *sqq*.). He meets the
objection that the Spirit, if God and of God, must needs be a Son, by
falling back upon the language of Scripture as our guide where human
analogies fail us. He also presses his opponents with the consequence
that they substitute a Dyad for a Trinity. <span id="page_lxiv">p.
lxiv</span> <span id="v.iii.i-Page_lxiv"></span>In the fourth letter, at
the request of Serapion, he gives an explanation of the words of Christ
about <span class="c10"><span id="v.iii.i-p4.30"></span>Sin Against the
Spirit</span>. Rejecting the view (Origen, Theognostus) that
post-baptismal sin is meant (§§9, *sqq*.), as favouring Novatianist
rigour, he examines the circumstances under which our Lord uttered the
warning. The Pharisees refused to regard the Lord as divine when they
saw His miracles, but ascribed them to Beelzebub. They blasphemed ‘the
Spirit,’ i.e. the Divine Personality of Christ (§19, cf. [Lam. iv.
20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020)<span id="v.iii.i-p4.31"></span>,
LXX.). So far as the words relate to the Holy Spirit, it is not because
the Spirit worked through Him (as through a prophet) but because He
worked through the Spirit (20). Blasphemy against the Spirit, then, is
blasphemy against Christ in its worst form (see also below, ch. iv.,
§6). It may be noted lastly that he refers to Origen in the same terms
of somewhat measured praise (ὁ πολυμαθὴς καὶ φιλόπονος), as in the *De
Decretis*.

<span id="v.iii.i-p5"></span>(23) 359–60. \*<span class="c10"><span

(30) Id.? \*Letter to <span class="c10"><span

<span class="c10"><span id="v.iii.i-p5.9"></span>Adelphius</span> and
<span class="c10"><span id="v.iii.i-p5.10"></span>Maximus</span> (60,
61). (32) 363–372 ? \*Letter to <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p5.11"></span>Diodorus of Tyre</span> (fragment, Letter 64).
(33) 372: \*Letters to <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p5.12"></span>John and Antiochus</span> and to <span
class="c10"><span id="v.iii.i-p5.13"></span>Palladius</span> (62, 63).
(34) 372? Two books against Apollinarianism (Migne xxvi. 1093, *sqq*.
Translated with notes, &c., in Bright, *Later Treatises of St. Athan*.).
The two books are also known under separate titles: Book I. as ‘<span
class="c10"><span id="v.iii.i-p5.14"></span>De Incarnatione D.N.J.C.
contra Apollinarium</span>,’ Book II. as ‘<span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p5.15"></span>De Salutari Adventu</span> D.N.J.C.’ The
Athanasian authorship has been doubted, chiefly on the ground of certain
peculiar expressions in the opening of Book I.; a searching
investigation of the question has not yet been made, but on the whole
the favourable verdict of Montfaucon holds the field. He lays stress on
the affinity of the work to letters 59–61. I would add that the studious
omission of any personal reference to Apollinarius is highly
characteristic.) In the first book Athanasius insists on the reality of
the human nature of Christ in the Gospels, and that it cannot be
co-essential with the Godhead. ‘We do not worship a creature?’ No; for
we worship not the Flesh of Christ as such but the Person who wears it,
viz. the Son of God. Lastly, he urges that the reality of redemption is
destroyed if the Incarnation does not extend to the spirit of man, the
seat of that sin which Christ came to atone for (§19), and seeks to
fasten upon his opponents a renewal (§§20, 21) of the system of Paul of
Samosata.

<span id="v.iii.i-p6"></span>The second book is addressed to the
question of the compatibility of the entire manhood with the entire
sinlessness of Christ. This difficulty he meets by insisting that the
Word took in our nature all that God had made, and nothing that is the
work of the devil. This excludes sin, and includes the totality of our
nature.

<span id="v.iii.i-p7"></span>This closes the list of the *dated* works
which can be ascribed with fair probability to Athanasius.

<span id="v.iii.i-p8"></span>The remainder of the writings of Athanasius
may be enumerated under groups, to which the ‘dated’ works will also be
assigned by their numbers as given above. Works falling into more than
one class are given under each.

<span id="v.iii.i-p9"></span>a. <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p9.1"></span>Letters</span>. ([Num.
3:0](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#000), [Num.
7:0](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#000), [Num.

id="v.iii.i-p9.2"></span>–28, 30–33; spurious letters, see *infr*. p.
581.)

<span id="v.iii.i-p10"></span>b. <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p10.1"></span>Dogmatic</span>. (2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 14, 20,
22–24, 26, 27, 29–31, 34.)

<span id="v.iii.i-p11"></span>(35.) *De Trinitate et Spiritu Sancto*
(Migne xxvi. 1191). Preserved in Latin only, but evidently from the
Greek. Pronounced genuine by Montfaucon, and dated (?) 365.

<span id="v.iii.i-p12"></span>(36) *De Incarnatione et Contra Arianos*
(ib. 984). The Athanasian authorship of this short tract is very
questionable. It is quoted as genuine by Theodoret *Dial*. ii. and by
Gelasius *de duabus naturis*. In some councils it is referred to as ‘On
the Trinity against Apollinarius;’ by Facundus as ‘On the Trinity.’ The
tract is in no sense directed against Apollinarius. In reality it is an
argument, mainly from Scripture, for the divinity of Christ, with a
digression (13–19) on that of the Holy Spirit. On the whole the evidence
is against the favourable verdict of Montfaucon, Ceillier, &c. That
Athanasius should, at any date possible for this tract, have referred to
the Trinity as ‘the three Hypostases’ is out of the question (§10): his
explanation of [Prov. viii. 22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022)<span
id="v.iii.i-p12.1"></span> in *Orat*. ii. 44 *sqq*. is in sharp contrast
with its reference *to the Church* in §6; at a time when the ideas of
Apollinarius were in the air and were combated by Athanasius (since 362)
he would not have used language savouring of that system (§§2, 3, 5, 7,
&c.). It has been thought that we have here one of the Apollinarian
tracts which were so industriously and successfully circulated under
celebrated names (*infra*, on No. 40); the express insistence on *two
wills* in Christ (§21), if not in favour of Athanasian might seem
decisive against Apollinarian authorship, but the peculiar turn of the
passage, which correlates the one will with <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p12.2"></span>σάρξ</span> the other with <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.i-p12.3"></span>πνεῦμα</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.i-p12.4"></span>θεός</span> is not
incompatible with the latter, which is, moreover, supported by the
constant insistance on God having come, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p12.5"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p12.6"></span>ν σαρκὶ</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p12.7"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p12.8"></span>ν ὁμοιώματι ἀνθρώπου</span>. The <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.i-p12.9"></span>ἄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.i-p12.10"></span>νθρωπος τέλειος</span> of
§8 and the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p12.11"></span>ὡ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p12.12"></span>μοιώθη κατὰ πάντα</span> of §11 lose their
edge in the context of those passages. The first part of §7 could
scarcely have been written by an earnest opponent of Apollinarianism.
This evidence is not conclusive, but it is worth considering, and, at
any rate, leaves it very difficult to meet the strong negative case
against the genuineness of the Tract. (Best discussion of the latter in
Bright, *Later Treatises of St. A*., p. 143; he is supported by Card.
Newman in a private letter.)

<span id="v.iii.i-p13"></span>(37) *The Sermo Maior de Fide*. (Migne
xxvi. 1263 *sqq*., with an additional fragment p. 1292 from Mai *Bibl.
nov*.). This is a puzzling document in many ways. It has points of
contact with the earliest works of Ath. (especially pieces nearly
verbatim from the *de Incarn*., see notes there), also with the *Expos.
Fid*. Card. Newman calls it with some truth ‘Hardly more than a set of
small fragments from Ath.’s other works.’ However this may be, it is
quoted by Theodoret as Athanasian more than once. The peculiarity lies
in the *constant* iteration of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p13.1"></span>῎</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p13.2"></span>Α</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p13.3"></span>νθρωπος</span> for the Lord’s human nature
(see note on *Exp. Fid*.), and in some places as though it were merely
the equivalent to <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p13.4"></span>σῶμα</span> or <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p13.5"></span>σάρξ</span>, while in others the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.i-p13.6"></span>῎</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.i-p13.7"></span>Α</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.i-p13.8"></span>νθρωπος</span> might be
taken as the seat of Personality (26, 32). Accordingly the tract might
be taken advantage of either by Nestorians, or still more by
Apollinarians. The ‘syllogistic method,’ praised in the work by
Montfaucon, was not unknown to the last-mentioned school. ([Prov. viii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022)<span id="v.iii.i-p13.9"></span> is
explained in the Athanasian way. For a fuller discussion, result
unfavourable, see Bright, *ubi supr*. p. 145.)

<span id="v.iii.i-p14"></span>(38) <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p14.1"></span>Fragments</span> against Paul of Samosata,
Macedonians, Novatians (Migne xxvi. 1293, 1313–1317). The first of these
may well be genuine. It repeats the (mistaken) statement of *Hist. Ar*.
71, that Zenobia was a Jewess. Of the second, all that can be said is
that it attacks the Macedonians in language borrowed <span
id="page_lxv">p. lxv</span> <span id="v.iii.i-Page_lxv"></span>from *Ep.
Æg*. 11. The third, consisting of a somewhat larger group of five
fragments, comprise a short sentence comparing the instrumentality of
the priest in absolving to his instrumentality in baptizing.

<span id="v.iii.i-p15"></span>It may be observed that fragments of this
brevity rarely furnish a decisive criterion of genuineness.

<span id="v.iii.i-p16"></span>(39) *Interpretatio Symboli* (ib. 1232,
Hahn, §66). Discussed fully by Caspari, *Ungedruckte u.s.w. Quellen* i.
pp. 1–72, and proved to be an adaptation of a baptismal creed drawn up
by Epiphanius (*Ancor. ad fin.*) in 374. It may be Alexandrian, and, if
so, by Bishop Peter or Theophilus about 380. It is a <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.i-p16.1"></span>῾</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.i-p16.2"></span>Ε</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.i-p16.3"></span>ρμηνεία</span>, or rather
an expansion, of the Nicene, not as Montf. says, of the Apostles’(!),
Creed.

<span id="v.iii.i-p17"></span>(40) *De Incarnatione Verbi Dei* (Migne
xxviii. 25–29). Quoted as Athanasian by Cyril of Alex., &c., and famous
as containing the phrase <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p17.1"></span>Μίαν φύσιν τοῦ Λόγου σέσαρκωμένην</span>
Apollinarian; one of the many forgeries from this school circulated
under the names of Athanasius, Gregory Thaumaturgus, Julius, &c. See
Caspari, *ubi supra* 151, Loofs, *Leontius*, p. 82, *sqq*. Caspari’s
proof is full and conclusive. See also Hahn, §120.

<span id="v.iii.i-p18"></span>(41) Verona Creed (Hahn, §41, *q.v.*), a
Latin fragment of a Western creed; nothing Athanasian but the <span
class="c10"><span id="v.iii.i-p18.1"></span>ms.</span> title.

<span id="v.iii.i-p19"></span>(42) ‘Damasine’ Creed (Opp. ed. Ben. ii.
626, Migne P.L lxii. 237 in *Vig. Thaps*.) forms the ‘eighth’ of the
*Libri de Trinitate* ascribed now to Athan. now to Damasus, &c., &c.:
see Hahn, §128 and note.

<span id="v.iii.i-p20"></span>(43) ‘*de Incarnatione*’ (Migne xxviii.
89), Anti-Nestorian: fifth century.

<span id="v.iii.i-p21"></span>c. <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p21.1"></span>Historical</span>, or historico-polemical (6,
8–10, 13–19, 23).

<span id="v.iii.i-p22"></span>(44) <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p22.1"></span>Fragment</span> concerning Stephen and the
Envoys at Antioch (Migne xxvi. 1293). Closely related (relative priority
not clear) to the account in Thdt. *H. E*., ii. 9.

<span id="v.iii.i-p23"></span>d. <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p23.1"></span>Apologetic</span>. To this class belong only
the works under No. (1).

<span id="v.iii.i-p24"></span>e. <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p24.1"></span>Exegetical</span> (5). The other exegetical
works attributed to Athan. are mainly in Migne, vol. xxvii.

<span id="v.iii.i-p25"></span>(45) <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p25.1"></span>Ad Marcellinum</span> de Interpretatione
Psalmorum. Certainly genuine. A thoughtful and devout tract on the
devotional use of the Psalter. He lays stress on its universality, as
summing up the spirit of all the other elements of Scripture, and as
applying to the spiritual needs of every soul in all conditions. He
remarks that the Psalms are sung not for musical effect, but that the
worshippers may have longer time to dwell upon their meaning. The whole
is presented as the discourse <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p25.2"></span>τινὸς φιλοπόνου γέροντος</span>, possibly an
ideal character.

<span id="v.iii.i-p26"></span>(46) <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p26.1"></span>Expositiones in Psalmos</span>, with an
Argumentum (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p26.2"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.i-p26.3"></span>πόθεσις</span>) prefixed. The latter notices
the arrangement of the Hebrew Psalter, the division into books, &c., and
accounts for the absence of logical order by the supposition that during
the Captivity some prophet collected as best he could the Scriptures
which the carelessness of the Israelites had allowed to fall into
disorder. The titles are to be followed as regards authorship.
Imprecatory passages relate to our ghostly enemies. In the Expositions
each Psalm is prefaced by a short statement of the general subject. He
occasionally refers to the rendering of Aquila, Theodotion, and
Symmachus.

<span id="v.iii.i-p27"></span>(47) <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p27.1"></span>Fragmenta in Psalmos</span>. Published by
Felckmann from the Catena of Nicetas Heracleota, who has used his
materials somewhat freely, often combining the comments of more than one
Father into a single whole.

<span id="v.iii.i-p28"></span>(48) <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p28.1"></span>De Titulis Psalmorum</span>. First published
by Antonelli in 1746. This work, consisting of very brief notes on the
Psalter verse by verse, is spoken of disparagingly by Alzog, *Patrol*.,
p. 229, and regarded as spurious, on good *prima facie* grounds, by
Gwatkin, p. 69, note. Eichhorn, *de Vit. Ascet*., p. 43, note, threatens
the latter (1886) with a refutation which, however, I have not seen.

<span id="v.iii.i-p29"></span>(49) <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p29.1"></span>Fragmentum in Cantica</span>. (Photius
mentions a Commentary on Eccles. and Cant.) From a Catena published by
Meursius in 1617. Very brief (on [Cant.
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007), [Cant.
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001),

6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001)<span id="v.iii.i-p29.2"></span>).
A spurious homily is printed (pp. 1349–1361) as an appendix to it.

Contain a remarkable reference to the Eucharist (p. 1380, on [Matt. vii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006)<span id="v.iii.i-p30.3"></span>) and
a somewhat disparaging reference to Origen (*infr*. p. 33) in reference
to [Matt. xii. 32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032)<span
id="v.iii.i-p30.4"></span>, which passage is explained as in Serap. iv.
(*vide supra* 22). The extracts purport in some cases to be taken from a
homiletical or expository work of Athanasius divided into separate <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iii.i-p30.5"></span>λόγοι</span>. The passage
‘on the nine incurable diseases of Herod’ is grotesque (Migne xxvi.
1252), but taken from Joseph., *B. J.* I. xxiii. 5. Cf. Euseb. *H. E*.
i. 8.

departed.

Contains little remarkable. ‘Behemoth’ is Satan, as elsewhere in Athan.

<span id="v.iii.i-p33"></span>(53) <span class="c10"><span

on [1 Cor. vii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001)<span

6.18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018)<span id="v.iii.i-p33.3"></span>,
somewhat inadequately explained.

<span id="v.iii.i-p34"></span>f. <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p34.1"></span>Moral and Ascetic</span>, (11–13, \[25\], 28).

id="v.iii.i-p35.1"></span>Sermo de Patientia</span>. (Migne xxvi. 1295.)
Of doubtful genuineness (Montf., Gwatkin).

<span id="v.iii.i-p36"></span>(55) <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p36.1"></span>De Virginitate</span>. (Migne xxviii. 251).
Pronounced dubious by Montf., spurious by Gwatkin, genuine by Eichhorn
(*ubi supr*., pp. 27, *sqq*.), who rightly lays stress on the early
stage of feminine asceticism which is implied. But I incline to agree
with Mr. Gwatkin as to its claims to come from Athanasius. ‘Three
hypostases’ are laid down in a way incompatible with Athanasius’ way of
speaking in later life.

<span id="v.iii.i-p37"></span>(56) <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p37.1"></span>Miscellaneous Fragments</span>. These are too
slight and uncertain to be either classed or discussed here. *De
Amuletis* (xxvi. 1319); *de Azymis*, (1327), very dubious; *In Ramos
palmarum* (1319), also dubious; various small homiletical and
controversial pieces (pp. 1224–1258) of various value and claims to
genuineness. (See also Migne xxv. p. xiv. No. xx.)

<span id="v.iii.i-p38"></span>(57) Of <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p38.1"></span>Lost Works</span> (in addition to those of
which fragments have been mentioned above) a Refutation of Arianism is
referred to in *Letter* 52. We also hear of a treatise against heresies
(a fragment above, No. 56). A ‘Synodicon,’ with the names of all Bishops
present at Nicæa, is quoted by Socr. i. 13, but is referred by Revillout
to his alleged Acts of the Synod of Alexandria in 362, which he supposes
to have reissued the Acts of Nicæa. See above, p. lix. A consolatory
address to the Virgins maltreated by George is mentioned by Theodoret,
*H. E.* ii. 14; he quotes a few words, referring to the fact that the
Arians would not even allow them peaceable burial, but ‘sit about the
tombs like demons’ to prevent it. The *Oratio de defunctis (infra*, ch.
iv. §6, fragment above, 56) is ascribed to him by John Damasc., but by
others to Cyril of Alexandria. <span id="page_lxvi">p. lxvi</span> <span
id="v.iii.i-Page_lxvi"></span>Many of his letters must have been lost.
The Festal Letters are still very incomplete, and his letters to S.
Basil would be a welcome discovery if they exist anywhere. A doctrinal
letter against the Arians, not preserved to us, is mentioned *de Decr*.
5. (See also Montfaucon’s *Præf*. ii. (Migne xxv. p. xxv., *sqq*), and
Jerome, *de Vir. illustr*. 87, a somewhat careless and scanty list.)

<span id="v.iii.i-p39"></span>The above enumeration includes all the
writings attributed with any probability to S. Athanasius. The
fragmentary character of many of them is no great presumption against
their genuineness. The Abbat Cosmas in the sixth century advised all who
met with anything by Athanasius to copy it, and if they had no paper, to
use their clothes for the purpose. This will readily explain (if
explanation is needed) the transmission of such numerous scraps of
writing under the name of the great bishop. It will also partly explain
the large body of <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p39.1"></span>Spurious Works</span> which have sheltered
themselves under his authority. To this class we have already assigned
several writings (25, 36, 37? 39–43, 44? 48? 53? 55, 56 in part). Others
whose claims are even less strong may be passed over, with only the
mention of one or two of the more important. They are all printed in
Migne, vol. xxviii., and parallels to some, especially the ‘dubious’ *In
passionem et crucem Domini*, are marked in Williams’ notes to the Festal
Letters, partly incorporated in this volume. The *epistola catholica*
and *Synopsis Scripturæ sacræ* are among the better known, and are
classed with a few others as ‘dubia’ by Montfaucon, the fictitious
*Disputatio habita in concilio Nicæno contra Arium*, among the ‘spuria.’
The silly tale *de Imagine Berytensi* seems to have enjoyed a wide
circulation in the middle ages. Of the other undoubtedly ‘spurious’
works the most famous is the ‘Athanasian Creed’ or *Quicunque Vult*. It
is needless to say that it is unconnected with Athanasius: its origin is
still *sub judice*. The second part of it bears traces of the period
*circa* 430 <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p39.2"></span>a.d.</span>, and the question which still
awaits a last word is whether the Symbol is or is not a fusion of two
originally independent documents. Messrs. Lumby, Swainson and others
have ably maintained this, but the difficulties of their hypothesis that
the fusion took place as late as about 800 <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p39.3"></span>a.d.</span> are very great, and I incline to
think will eventually prove fatal to it. But the discussion does not
belong to our present subject.
