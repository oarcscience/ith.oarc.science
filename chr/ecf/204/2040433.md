<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>From Letter XXIX <span
id="fr_4528"></span>[4529](#fn_4528) .</span>—*(For 357..md) From the
twenty-ninth Letter, of which the beginning is, ‘Sufficient for this
present time is that which we have already written.’*

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xxii-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xxii-p3.1"></span>The</span> Lord proved the
disciples <span id="fr_4529"></span>[4530](#fn_4529.md) , when He was
asleep on the pillow, at which time a miracle was wrought, which is
especially calculated to put even the wicked to shame. For when He
arose, and rebuked the sea, and silenced the storm, He plainly shewed
two things; that the storm of the sea was not from the winds, but from
fear of its Lord Who walked upon it, and that the Lord Who rebuked it
was not a creature, but rather its Creator, since a creature is not
obedient to another creature. For although the Red Sea was divided
before by Moses <span id="fr_4530"></span>[4531](#fn_4530.md) , yet it was
not Moses who did it, for it came to pass, not because he spoke, but
because God commanded. And if the sun stood still in Gibeon <span
id="fr_4531"></span>[4532](#fn_4531.md) , and the moon in the valley of
Ajalon, yet this was the work, not of the son of Nun, but of the Lord,
Who heard his prayer. He it was Who both rebuked the sea, and on the
cross caused the sun to be darkened <span
id="fr_4532"></span>[4533](#fn_4532.md) .
