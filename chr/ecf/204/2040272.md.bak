<span id="xviii.ii.vii-p1"></span> 7. *This charge utterly incredible
and absurd.*

<span id="xviii.ii.vii-p2"></span>Is it not mere madness in my accuser
even to suspect me of such a thing? What, I ask again, could induce me
to place confidence in this man? What trait did I perceive in his
character on which I could rely? He had <span id="page_241">p.
241</span> <span id="xviii.ii.vii-Page_241"></span>murdered his own
master; he had proved faithless to his friends; he had violated his
oath; he had blasphemed God, by consulting poisoners and sorcerers <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309.md) contrary to his Law. And with what
conscience could I send greeting to such a man, whose madness and
cruelty had afflicted not me only, but all the world around me? To be
sure, I was very greatly indebted to him for his conduct, that when your
departed brother had filled our churches with sacred offerings, he
murdered him. For the wretch was not moved by the sight of these his
gifts, nor did he stand in awe of the divine grace which had been given
to him in baptism: but like an accursed and devilish spirit, he raged
against him, till your blessed brother suffered martyrdom at his hands;
while he, henceforth a criminal like Cain, was driven from place to
place, ‘groaning and trembling <span
id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310.md) ,’ to the end that he might follow
the example of Judas in his death, by becoming his own executioner, and
so bring upon himself a double weight of punishment in the judgment to
come.
