<span id="vii.ii.vii-p1"></span> §7. *On the other hand there was the
consistency of God’s nature, not to be sacrificed for our profit. Were
men, then, to be called upon to repent? But repentance cannot avert the
execution of a law; still less can it remedy a fallen nature. We have
incurred corruption and need to be restored to the Grace of God’s Image.
None could renew but He Who had created. He alone could (1) recreate
all, (2) suffer for all, (3) represent all to the Father.*

<span id="vii.ii.vii-p2"></span>But just as this consequence must needs
hold, so, too, on the other side the just claims <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) of God lie against it: that God should
appear true to the law He had laid down concerning death. For it were
monstrous for God, the Father of truth, to appear a liar for our profit
and preservation. 2. So here, once more, what possible course was God to
take? To demand repentance of men for their transgression? For this one
might pronounce worthy of God; as <span id="page_40">p. 40</span> <span
id="vii.ii.vii-Page_40"></span>though, just as from transgression men
have become set towards corruption, so from repentance they may once
more be set in the way of incorruption. 3. But repentance would,
firstly, fail to guard the just claim <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) of God. For He would still be none the
more true, if men did not remain in the grasp of death; nor, secondly,
does repentance call men back from what is their nature—it merely stays
them from acts of sin. 4. Now, if there were merely a misdemeanour in
question, and not a consequent corruption, repentance were well enough.
But if, when transgression had once gained a start, men became involved
in that corruption which was their nature, and were deprived of the
grace which they had, being in the image of God, what further step was
needed? or what was required for such grace and such recall, but the
Word of God, which had also at the beginning made everything out of
nought? 5. For His it was once more both to bring the corruptible to
incorruption, and to maintain intact the just claim <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) of the Father upon all. For being Word
of the Father, and above all, He alone of natural fitness was both able
to recreate everything, and worthy to suffer on behalf of all and to be
ambassador for all with the Father.

[Next: The Word, then, visited that earth in which He was yet always
present ; and saw all these evils. He takes a body of our Nature, and
that of a spotless Virgin, in whose womb He makes it His own, wherein to
reveal Himself, conquer death, and restore life.](2040105.md)
