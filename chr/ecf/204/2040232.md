<span id="xvi.ii.xxi-p1"></span> 57. Wherefore a man, Fronto by name,
who was an officer of the Court and had a terrible disease, for he used
to bite his own tongue and was in danger of injury to his eyes, having
come to the mountain, asked Antony to pray for him. But Antony said to
him, ‘Depart and thou shalt be healed.’ But when he was violent and
remained within some days, Antony waited and said, ‘If thou stayest
here, thou canst not be healed. Go, and having come into Egypt thou
shalt see the sign wrought in thee.’ And he believed and went. And as
soon as he set eyes on Egypt his sufferings ceased, and the man became
whole according to the word of Antony, which the Saviour had revealed to
him in prayer.
