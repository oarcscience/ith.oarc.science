<span id="vi.ii.i.iv-p1"></span> §4. *The gradual abasement of the Soul
from Truth to Falsehood by the abuse of her freedom of Choice.*

<span id="vi.ii.i.iv-p2"></span>Having departed from the contemplation
of the things of thought, and using to the full the several activities
of the body, and being pleased with the contemplation of the body, and
seeing that pleasure is good for her, she was misled and abused the name
of good, and thought that pleasure was the very es<span id="page_6">p.

though a man out of his mind and asking for a sword to use against all
he met, were to think that soundness of mind. 2. But having fallen in
love with pleasure, she began to work it out in various ways. For being
by nature mobile, even though she have turned away from what is good,
yet she does not lose her mobility. She moves then, no longer according
to virtue or so as to see God, but imagining false things, she makes a
novel use of her power, abusing it as a means to the pleasures she has
devised, since she is after all made with power over herself. 3. For she
is able, as on the one hand to incline to what is good, so on the other
to reject it; but in rejecting the good she of course entertains the
thought of what is opposed to it, for she cannot at all cease from
movement, being, as I said before, mobile by nature. And knowing her own
power over herself, she sees that she is able to use the members of her
body in either direction, both toward what is, or toward what is not. 4.
But good is, while evil is not; by what is, then, I mean what is good,
inasmuch as it has its pattern in God Who is. But by what is not I mean
what is evil, in so far as it consists in a false imagination in the
thoughts of men. For though the body has eyes so as to see Creation, and
by its entirely harmonious construction to recognise the Creator; and
ears to listen to the divine oracles and the laws of God; and hands both
to perform works of necessity and to raise to God in prayer; yet the
soul, departing from the contemplation of what is good and from moving
in its sphere, wanders away and moves toward its contraries. 5. Then
seeing, as I said before, and abusing her power, she has perceived that
she can move the members of the body also in an opposite way: and so,
instead of beholding the Creation, she turns the eye to lusts, shewing
that she has this power too; and thinking that by the mere fact of
moving she is maintaining her own dignity, and is doing no sin in doing
as she pleases; not knowing that she is made not merely to move, but to
move in the right direction. For this is why an apostolic utterance
assures us “All things are lawful, but not all things are
expedient <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) .”
