<span id="vi.ii.iii.i-p1"></span> <span class="c8"><span
id="vi.ii.iii.i-p1.1"></span>Part III.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.iii.i-p2"></span>§35. *Creation a revelation of God;
especially in the order and harmony pervading the whole*.

<span id="vi.ii.iii.i-p3"></span>For God, being good and loving to
mankind, and caring for the souls made by Him,—since He is by nature
invisible and incomprehensible, having His being beyond all created
existence <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) , for which reason the
race of mankind was likely to miss the way to the knowledge of Him,
since they are made out of nothing while He is unmade,—for this cause
God by His own Word gave the Universe the Order it has, in order that
since He is by nature invisible, men might be enabled to know Him at any
rate by His works <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) . For often
the artist even when not seen is known by his works. 2. And as they tell
of Phidias the Sculptor that his works of art by their symmetry and by
the proportion of their parts betray Phidias to those who see them
although he is not there, so by the order of the Universe one ought to
perceive God its maker and artificer, even though He be not seen with
the bodily eyes. For God did not take His stand upon His invisible
nature (let none plead that as an excuse) and leave Himself utterly
unknown to men; but as I said above, He so ordered Creation that
although He is by nature invisible He may yet be known by His works. 3.
And I say this not on my own authority, but on the strength of what I
learned from men who have spoken of God, among them Paul, who thus
writes to the Romans <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) : “for the
invisible things of Him since the creation of the world are clearly
seen, being understood by the things that are made;” while to the
Lycaonians he speaks out and says <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) : “We also are men of like passions
with you, and bring you good tidings, to turn from these <span
id="page_23">p. 23</span> <span id="vi.ii.iii.i-Page_23"></span>vain
things unto a Living God, Who made the heaven and the earth and the sea,
and all that in them is, Who in the generations gone by suffered all
nations to walk in their own ways. And yet He left not Himself without
witness, in that He did good, and gave you <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) from heaven rains and fruitful
seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.” 4. For who that
sees the circle of heaven and the course of the sun and the moon, and
the positions and movements of the other stars, as they take place in
opposite and different directions, while yet in their difference all
with one accord observe a consistent order, can resist the conclusion
that these are not ordered by themselves, but have a maker distinct from
themselves who orders them? or who that sees the sun rising by day and
the moon shining by night, and waning and waxing without variation
exactly according to the same number of days, and some of the stars
running their courses and with orbits various and manifold, while others
move <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) without wandering, can fail
to perceive that they certainly have a creator to guide them?
