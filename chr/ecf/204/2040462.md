<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xx-Page_581"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Memorandum</span>.—*On other Letters
ascribed to Athanasius.*

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xx-p2"></span>The above Collection of Letters is
complete upon the principle stated in the Introduction (*supr.,* p.
495). But one or two fragments have been excluded which may be specified
here.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xx-p3"></span>(1.) Fragment of a letter ‘to
Eupsychius;’ probably the Nicene Father referred to *Ep. Æg.* 8, (cf.
D.C.B. ii. 299 (4)). The Greek is given by Montf. in Ath. *Opp.* 1. p.
1293 (Latin, *ib.* p. 1287). It was cited in *Conc. Nic.* II. [Act
vi.](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#000.md)<span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xx-p3.1"></span>, but although it has affinities with
*Orat.* ii. 8 (‘high-priestly *dress*’), it has the appearance of a
polemical argument against Monophysitism. (Migne xxvi. 1245.)

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xx-p4"></span>(2.) ‘To Epiphanius’ (Migne xxvi.
1257). Against certain, who contentiously follow the Jews in celebrating
Easter. (From ‘*Chron. Pasch.* pag. 4 postremæ editionis.’)

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xx-p5"></span>(3.) Fragments of an ‘Epistola ad
Antiochenos’ (not our ‘Tomus,’ *supr.,* p. 483): also a polemic against
Monophysitism, and almost Nestorian in doctrine: ‘Jesus Christus…non est
Ipse’ \[i.e. ante sæcula et in sæcula, [Heb. xiii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008.md)<span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xx-p5.1"></span>\], and ‘duas personas’ asserted of
Christ. From Facundus, who says the letter was written against the
Apollinarians, and who gives it on the authority of Peter, Ath.’s
successor (Migne xxvi. 1259).

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xx-p6"></span>(4.) ‘Ad Eusebium, Lucinianum, et
socios.’ (In Migne xxvi. 1325 *sq.,* from Mai, *Script. Vet.* 11. 583
*sq.*) A minute fragment. Cf. *supr., Letter* 55, notes 1, 7.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xx-p7"></span>(5.) Spurious letters (in Migne
xxviii.) to Jovian, to Castor (2), to a ‘bishop of the Persians,’ and to
and from popes Liberius, Marcus, Julius and Felix (made up out of late
and spurious decretals, &c., &c.).
