id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p3.5"></span></span> *Introduction. The doctrine of the
coinherence. The Father and the Son Each whole and perfect God. They are
in Each Other, because their Essence is One and the Same. They are Each
Perfect and have One Essence, because the Second Person is the Son of
the First. Asterius’s evasive explanation of the text under review;
refuted. Since the Son has all that the Father has, He is His Image; and
the Father is the One God, because the Son is in the Father.*

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p4"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p4.1"></span>The</span> Ario-maniacs, as it appears,
having once made up their minds to transgress and revolt from the Truth,
are strenuous in appropriating the words of Scripture, ‘When the impious
cometh into a depth of evils, he despiseth <span
id="fr_2785"></span>[2786](#fn_2785.md) ;’ for refutation does not stop
them, nor perplexity abash them; but, as having ‘a whore’s forehead,’
they ‘refuse to be ashamed <span id="fr_2786"></span>[2787](#fn_2786.md) ’
before all men in their irreligion. For whereas the passages which they
alleged, ‘The Lord created me <span id="fr_2787"></span>[2788](#fn_2787.md)
,’ and ‘Made better than the Angels <span
id="fr_2788"></span>[2789](#fn_2788.md) ,’ and ‘First-born <span
id="fr_2789"></span>[2790](#fn_2789.md) ,’ and ‘Faithful to Him that made
Him <span id="fr_2790"></span>[2791](#fn_2790.md) ’ have a right
sense <span id="fr_2791"></span>[2792](#fn_2791.md) , and inculcate
religiousness towards Christ, so it is that these men still, as if
bedewed with the serpent’s poison, not seeing what they ought to see,
nor understanding what they read, as if in vomit from the depth of their
irreligious heart, have next proceeded to disparage our Lord’s words, ‘I
in the Father and the Father in Me <span
id="fr_2792"></span>[2793](#fn_2792.md) ;’ saying, ‘How can the One be
contained in the Other and the Other in the One?’ or ‘How at all can the
Father who is the greater be contained in the Son who is the less?’ or
‘What wonder, if the Son is in the Father,’ considering it is written
even of us, ‘In Him we live and move and have our being <span
id="fr_2793"></span>[2794](#fn_2793.md) ?’ And this state of mind is
consistent with their perverseness, who think God to be material, and
understand not what <span id="page_394">p. 394</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-Page_394"></span>is ‘True Father’ and ‘True Son,’ nor
‘Light Invisible’ and ‘Eternal,’ and Its ‘Radiance Invisible,’ nor
‘Invisible Subsistence,’ and ‘Immaterial Expression’ and ‘Immaterial
Image.’ For did they know, they would not dishonour and ridicule the
Lord of glory, nor interpreting things immaterial after a material
manner, pervert good words. It were sufficient indeed, on hearing only
words which are the Lord’s, at once to believe, since the faith of
simplicity is better than an elaborate process of persuasion; but since
they have endeavoured to profane even this passage to their own heresy,
it becomes necessary to expose their perverseness and to shew the mind
of the truth, at least for the security of the faithful. For when it is
said, ‘I in the Father and the Father in Me,’ They are not therefore, as
these suppose, discharged into Each Other, filling the One the Other, as
in the case of empty vessels, so that the Son fills the emptiness of the
Father and the Father that of the Son <span
id="fr_2794"></span>[2795](#fn_2794.md) , and Each of Them by Himself is
not complete and perfect (for this is proper to bodies, and therefore
the mere assertion of it is full of irreligion), for the Father is full
and perfect, and the Son is the Fulness of Godhead. Nor again, as God,
by coming into the Saints, strengthens them, thus is He also in the Son.
For He is Himself the Father’s Power and Wisdom, and by partaking of Him
things originate are sanctified in the Spirit; but the Son Himself is
not Son by participation, but is the Father’s own Offspring <span
id="fr_2795"></span>[2796](#fn_2795.md) . Nor again is the Son in the
Father, in the sense of the passage, ‘In Him we live and move and have
our being;’ for, He as being from the Fount <span
id="fr_2796"></span>[2797](#fn_2796.md) of the Father is the Life, in which
all things are both quickened and consist; for the Life does not live in
life <span id="fr_2797"></span>[2798](#fn_2797.md) , else it would not be
Life, but rather He gives life to all things.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p18"></span>2. But now let us see what Asterius
the Sophist says, the retained pleader <span
id="fr_2798"></span>[2799](#fn_2798.md) for the heresy. In imitation then
of the Jews so far, he writes as follows; ‘It is very plain that He has
said, that He is in the Father and the Father again in Him, for this
reason, that neither the word on which He was discoursing is, as He
says, His own, but the Father’s, nor the works belong to Him, but to the
Father who gave Him the power.’ Now this, if uttered at random by a
little child, had been excused from his age; but when one who bears the
title of Sophist, and professes universal knowledge <span
id="fr_2799"></span>[2800](#fn_2799.md) , is the writer, what a serious
condemnation does he deserve! And does he not shew himself a stranger to
the Apostle <span id="fr_2800"></span>[2801](#fn_2800.md) , as being puffed
up with persuasive words of wisdom, and thinking thereby to succeed in
deceiving, not understanding himself what he says nor whereof he
affirms <span id="fr_2801"></span>[2802](#fn_2801.md) ? For what the Son
has said as proper and suitable to a Son only, who is Word and Wisdom
and Image of the Father’s Essence, that he levels to all the creatures,
and makes common to the Son and to them; and he says, lawless <span
id="fr_2802"></span>[2803](#fn_2802.md) man, that the Power of the Father
receives power, that from this his irreligion it may follow to say that
in a son <span id="fr_2803"></span>[2804](#fn_2803.md) the Son was made a
son, and the Word received a word’s authority; and, far from granting
that He spoke this as a Son, He ranks Him with all things made as having
learned it as they have. For if the Son said, ‘I am in the Father and
the Father in Me,’ because His discourses were not His own words but the
Father’s, and so of His works, then,—since David says, ‘I will hear what
the Lord God shall say in me <span id="fr_2804"></span>[2805](#fn_2804.md)
,’ and again Solomon <span id="fr_2805"></span>[2806](#fn_2805.md) , ‘My
words are spoken by God,’ and since Moses was minister of words which
were from God, and each of the Prophets spoke not what was his own but
what was from God, ‘Thus saith the Lord,’ and since the works of the
Saints, as they professed, were not their own but God’s who gave the
power, Elijah for instance and Elisha invoking God that He Himself would
raise the dead, and Elisha saying to Naaman, on cleansing him from the
<span id="page_395">p. 395</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-Page_395"></span>leprosy, ‘that thou mayest know that
there is a God in Israel <span id="fr_2806"></span>[2807](#fn_2806.md) ,’
and Samuel too in the days of the harvest praying to God to grant rain,
and the Apostles saying that not in their own power they did miracles
but in the Lord’s grace—it is plain that, according to Asterius such a
statement must be common to all, so that each of them is able to say, ‘I
in the Father and the Father in me;’ and as a consequence that He is no
longer one Son of God and Word and Wisdom, but, as others, is only one
out of many.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p28"></span>3. But if the Lord said this, His
words would not rightly have been, ‘I in the Father and the Father in
Me,’ but rather, ‘I too am in the Father, and the Father is in Me too,’
that He may have nothing of His own and by prerogative <span
id="fr_2807"></span>[2808](#fn_2807.md) , relatively to the Father, as a
Son, but the same grace in common with all. But it is not so, as they
think; for not understanding that He is genuine Son from the Father,
they belie Him who is such, whom alone it befits to say, ‘I in the
Father and the Father in Me.’ For the Son is in the Father, as it is
allowed us to know, because the whole Being of the Son is proper to the
Father’s essence <span id="fr_2808"></span>[2809](#fn_2808.md) , as
radiance from light, and stream from fountain; so that whoso sees the
Son, sees what is proper to the Father, and knows that the Son’s Being,
because from the Father, is therefore in the Father. For the Father is
in the Son, since the Son is what is from the Father and proper to Him,
as in the radiance the sun, and in the word the thought, and in the
stream the fountain: for whoso thus contemplates the Son, contemplates
what is proper to the Father’s Essence, and knows that the Father is in
the Son. For whereas the Form <span id="fr_2809"></span>[2810](#fn_2809.md)
and Godhead of the Father is the Being of the Son, it follows that the
Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son <span
id="fr_2810"></span>[2811](#fn_2810.md) .

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p33"></span>4. On this account and reasonably,
having said before, ‘I and the Father are One,’ He added, ‘I in the
Father and the Father in Me, <span id="fr_2811"></span>[2812](#fn_2811.md)
’ by way of shewing the identity <span
id="fr_2812"></span>[2813](#fn_2812.md) of Godhead and the unity of
Essence. For they are one, not <span
id="fr_2813"></span>[2814](#fn_2813.md) as one thing divided into two
parts, and these nothing but one, nor as one thing twice named, so that
the Same becomes at one time Father, at another His own Son, for this
Sabellius holding was judged an heretic. But They are two, because the
Father is Father and is not also Son, and the Son is Son and not also
Father <span id="fr_2814"></span>[2815](#fn_2814.md) ; but the nature is
one; (for the offspring is not unlike <span
id="fr_2815"></span>[2816](#fn_2815) its parent, for it is his image.md),
and all that is the Father’s, is the Son’s <span
id="fr_2816"></span>[2817](#fn_2816.md) . Wherefore neither is the Son
another God, for He was not procured from without, else were there many,
if a godhead be procured foreign from the Father’s <span
id="fr_2817"></span>[2818](#fn_2817.md) ; for if the Son be other, as an
Offspring, still He is the Same as God; and He and the Father are one in
propriety and peculiarity of nature, and in the identity of the one
Godhead, as has been said. For the radiance also is light, not second to
the sun, nor a different light, nor from participation of it, but a
whole and proper offspring of it. And such an offspring is necessarily
one light; and no one would say that they are two lights <span
id="fr_2818"></span>[2819](#fn_2818.md) , but sun and radiance two, yet one
the light from the sun enlightening in its radiance all things. So also
the Godhead of the Son is the Father’s; whence also it is indivisible;
and thus there is one God and none other but He. And so, since they are
one, and the Godhead itself one, the same things are said of the Son,
which are said of the Father, except His being said to be Father <span
id="fr_2819"></span>[2820](#fn_2819.md) :—for instance <span
id="fr_2820"></span>[2821](#fn_2820.md) , that He is God, ‘And the Word was
God <span id="fr_2821"></span>[2822](#fn_2821.md) ;’ Almighty, ‘Thus saith
He which was and is and is to come, the Almighty <span
id="fr_2822"></span>[2823](#fn_2822.md) ;’ Lord, ‘One Lord Jesus
Christ <span id="fr_2823"></span>[2824](#fn_2823.md) ;’ that He is Light,
‘I am the Light <span id="fr_2824"></span>[2825](#fn_2824.md) ;’ that He
wipes out sins, ‘that ye may know,’ He says, ‘that the Son of man hath
power upon earth to forgive sins <span
id="fr_2825"></span>[2826](#fn_2825.md) ;’ and so with other attributes.
For ‘all things,’ says the Son Himself, ‘whatsoever the Father hath, are
Mine <span id="fr_2826"></span>[2827](#fn_2826.md) ;’ and again, ‘And Mine
are Thine.’

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p50"></span>5. And on hearing the attributes of
the Father spoken of a Son, we shall thereby see the Father in the Son;
and we shall contemplate the Son in the Father, when what is said of the
Son is said of the Father also. <span id="page_396">p. 396</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-Page_396"></span>And why are the attributes of the
Father ascribed to the Son, except that the Son is an Offspring from
Him? and why are the Son’s attributes proper to the Father, except again
because the Son is the proper Offspring of His Essence? And the Son,
being the proper Offspring of the Father’s Essence, reasonably says that
the Father’s attributes are His own also; whence suitably and
consistently with saying, ‘I and the Father are One,’ He adds, ‘that ye
may know that I am in the Father and the Father in Me <span
id="fr_2827"></span>[2828](#fn_2827.md) .’ Moreover, He has added this
again, ‘He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father <span
id="fr_2828"></span>[2829](#fn_2828.md) ;’ and there is one and the same
sense in these three <span id="fr_2829"></span>[2830](#fn_2829.md)
passages. For he who in this sense understands that the Son and the
Father are one, knows that He is in the Father and the Father in the
Son; for the Godhead of the Son is the Father’s, and it is in the Son;
and whoso enters into this, is convinced that ‘He that hath seen the
Son, hath seen the Father;’ for in the Son is contemplated the Father’s
Godhead. And we may perceive this at once from the illustration of the
Emperor’s image. For in the image is the shape and form of the Emperor,
and in the Emperor is that shape which is in the image. For the likeness
of the Emperor in the image is exact <span
id="fr_2830"></span>[2831](#fn_2830.md) ; so that a person who looks at the
image, sees in it the Emperor; and he again who sees the Emperor,
recognises that it is he who is in the image <span
id="fr_2831"></span>[2832](#fn_2831.md) . And from the likeness not
differing, to one who after the image wished to view the Emperor, the
image might say, ‘I and the Emperor are one; for I am in him, and he in
me; and what thou seest in me, that thou beholdest in him, and what thou
hast seen in him, that thou holdest in me <span
id="fr_2832"></span>[2833](#fn_2832.md) .’ Accordingly he who worships the
image, in it worships the Emperor also; for the image is his form and
appearance. Since then the Son too is the Father’s Image, it must
necessarily be understood that the Godhead and propriety of the Father
is the Being of the Son.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p57"></span>6. And this is what is said, ‘Who
being in the form of God <span id="fr_2833"></span>[2834](#fn_2833.md) ,’
and ‘the Father in Me.’ Nor is this Form <span
id="fr_2834"></span>[2835](#fn_2834.md) of the Godhead partial merely, but
the fulness of the Father’s Godhead is the Being of the Son, and the Son
is whole God. Therefore also, being equal to God, He ‘thought it not a
prize to be equal to God;’ and again since the Godhead and the Form of
the Son is none other’s than the Father’s <span
id="fr_2835"></span>[2836](#fn_2835.md) , this is what He says, ‘I in the
Father.’ Thus ‘God was in Christ reconciling the world unto
Himself <span id="fr_2836"></span>[2837](#fn_2836.md) ;’ for the propriety
of the Father’s Essence is that Son, in whom the creation was then
reconciled with God. Thus what things the Son then wrought are the
Father’s works, for the Son is the Form of that Godhead of the Father,
which wrought the works. And thus he who looks at the Son, sees the
Father; for in the Father’s Godhead is and is contemplated the Son; and
the Father’s Form which is in Him shews in Him the Father; and thus the
Father is in the Son. And that propriety and Godhead which is from the
Father in the Son, shews the Son in the Father, and His inseparability
from Him; and whoso hears and beholds that what is said of the Father is
also said of the Son, not as accruing to His Essence by grace or
participation, but because the very Being of the Son is the proper
Offspring of the Father’s Essence, will fitly understand the words, as I
said before, ‘I in the Father, and the Father in Me;’ and ‘I and the
Father are One <span id="fr_2837"></span>[2838](#fn_2837.md) .’ For the Son
is such as the Father is, because He has all that is the Father’s.
Wherefore also is He implied together with the Father. For, a son not
being, one cannot say father; whereas when we call God a Maker, we do
not of necessity intimate the things which have come to be; for a maker
is before his works <span id="fr_2838"></span>[2839](#fn_2838.md) . <span
id="page_397">p. 397</span> <span id="xxi.ii.iv.i-Page_397"></span>But
when we call God Father, at once with the Father we signify the Son’s
existence. Therefore also he who believes in the Son, believes also in
the Father: for he believes in what is proper to the Father’s Essence;
and thus the faith is one in one God. And he who worships and honours
the Son, in the Son worships and honours the Father; for one is the
Godhead; and therefore one <span id="fr_2839"></span>[2840](#fn_2839.md)
the honour and one the worship which is paid to the Father in and
through the Son. And he who thus worships, worships one God; for there
is one God and none other than He. Accordingly when the Father is called
the only God, and we read that there is one God <span
id="fr_2840"></span>[2841](#fn_2840.md) , and ‘I am,’ and ‘beside Me there
is no God,’ and ‘I the first and I the last <span
id="fr_2841"></span>[2842](#fn_2841.md) ,’ this has a fit meaning. For God
is One and Only and First; but this is not said to the denial of the
Son <span id="fr_2842"></span>[2843](#fn_2842.md) , perish the thought; for
He is in that One, and First and Only, as being of that One and Only and
First the Only Word and Wisdom and Radiance. And He too is the First, as
the Fulness of the Godhead of the First and Only, being whole and full
God <span id="fr_2843"></span>[2844](#fn_2843.md) . This then is not said
on His account, but to deny that there is other such as the Father and
His Word.

28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p13.1"></span>. Vid. *supr.* ii. 41, note 11. The
doctrine of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p13.3"></span>περιχώρησις</span>, which this objection
introduces, is the test of orthodoxy opposed to Arianism. Cf. *de Syn.*
15, n. 4. This is seen clearly in the case of Eusebius, whose language
approaches to Catholic more nearly than Arians in general. After all his
strong assertions, the question recurs, is our Lord a distinct being
from God, as we are, or not? he answers in the affirmative, vid. *supr.*
p. 75, n. 7, whereas we believe that He is literally and numerically one
with the Father, and therefore His Person dwells in the Father’s Person
by an ineffable union. And hence the language of Dionysius \[of Rome\]
*supr. de Decr.* 26. ‘the Holy Ghost must repose and habitate in God,’
<span class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p13.5"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p13.6"></span>μφιλοχωρεῖν τῷ θεῷ καὶ
ἐνδιαιτᾶσθαι</span>. And hence the strong figure of S. Jerome (in which
he is followed by S. Cyril, *Thesaur.* p. 51), ‘Filius locus est Patris,
sicut et Pater locus est Filii.’ in [Ezek. iii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p13.8"></span>. So Athan. contrasts the creatures who
are <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p13.10"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p13.11"></span>ν μεμερισμένοις τόποις</span> and the
Son. *Serap.* iii. 4. Cf. even in the Macrostich Creed, language of this
character, viz. ‘All the Father embosoming the Son, and all the Son
hanging and adhering to the Father, and alone resting on the Father’s
breast continually.’ *De Syn.* 26 (7), where vid. note 3.

<span id="fn_2794"></span>[394:2795](2040371.htm#fr_2794.md) <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p13.13"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p14"></span> This is not inconsistent with S.
Jerome as quoted in the foregoing note. Athan. merely means that such
illustrations cannot be taken literally, as if spoken of natural
subjects. The Father is the <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p14.2"></span>τόπος</span> or locus of the Son, because
when we contemplate the Son in His fulness as <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p14.4"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p14.5"></span>λος θεός</span>, we merely view the Father
as that Person in whom God the Son is; our mind abstracts His Essence
which is the Son for the moment from Him, and regards Him merely as
Father. Thus *in* *Illud. Omn.* 4, *supr.* p. 89. It is, however, but an
operation of the mind, and not a real emptying of Godhead from the
Father, if such words may be used. Father and Son are both the same God,
though really and eternally distinct from each other; and Each is full
of the Other, that is, their Essence is one and the same. This is
insisted on by S. Cyril, *in Joan.* p. 28. And by S. Hilary, *Trin.*

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p30"></span> Since the Father and the Son are the
numerically One God, it is but expressing this in other words to say
that the Father is in the Son and the Son in the Father, for all They
have and all They are is common to Each, excepting Their being Father
and Son. A <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p30.2"></span>περιχώρησις</span> of Persons is implied
in the Unity of Essence. This is the connexion of the two texts so often
quoted; ‘the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son,’ because
‘the Son and the Father are one.’ And the cause of this unity and <span
class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p30.4"></span>περιχώρησις</span> is
the Divine <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.i-p56"></span> Athanasius guards against what is
defective in this illustration in the next chapter, but independent of
such explanation a mistake as to his meaning would be impossible; and
the passage affords a good instance of the imperfect and partial
character of all illustrations of the Divine Mystery. What it is taken
to symbolize is the unity of the Father and Son, for the Image is not a
Second Emperor but the same. vid. *Sabell. Greg.* 6. But no one, who
bowed before the Emperor’s Statue can be supposed to have really
worshipped it; whereas our Lord is the Object of supreme worship, which
terminates in Him, as being really one with Him whose Image He is. From
the custom of paying honour to the Imperial Statues, the Cultus Imaginum
was introduced into the Eastern Church. The Western Church, not having
had the civil custom, resisted. vid. Döllinger, *Church History,* vol.
3. p. 55. E. Tr. The Fathers, e.g. S. Jerome, set themselves against the
civil custom, as idolatrous, comparing it to that paid to
Nebuchadnezzar’s statue. vid. Hieron. in [Dan. iii.

[Next: Texts Explained; Eighthly, John xvii. 3. and the Like. Our Lord's
divinity cannot interfere with His Father's prerogatives, as the One
God, which were so earnestly upheld by the Son. 'One' is used in
contrast to false gods and idols, not to the Son, through whom the
Father spoke. Our Lord adds His Name to the Father's, as included in
Him. The Father the First, not as if the Son were not First too, but as
Origin.](2040372.md)
