<span id="vii.ii.viii-p1"></span> §8. *The Word, then, visited that
earth in which He was yet always present ; and saw all these evils. He
takes a body of our Nature, and that of a spotless Virgin, in whose womb
He makes it His own, wherein to reveal Himself, conquer death, and
restore life.*

<span id="vii.ii.viii-p2"></span>For this purpose, then, the incorporeal
and incorruptible and immaterial Word of God comes to our realm, howbeit
he was not far from us <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) before.
For no part of Creation is left void of Him: He has filled all things
everywhere, remaining present with His own Father. But He comes in
condescension to shew loving-kindness upon us, and to visit us. 2. And
seeing the race of rational creatures in the way to perish, and death
reigning over them by corruption; seeing, too, that the threat against
transgression gave a firm hold to the corruption which was upon us, and
that it was monstrous that <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md)
before the law was fulfilled it should fall through: seeing, once more,
the unseemliness of what was come to pass: that the things whereof He
Himself was Artificer were passing away: seeing, further, the exceeding
wickedness of men, and how by little and little they had increased it to
an intolerable pitch against themselves: and seeing, lastly, how all men
were under penalty of death: He took pity on our race, and had mercy on
our infirmity, and condescended to our corruption, and, unable to bear
that death should have the mastery—lest the creature should perish, and
His Father’s handiwork in men be spent for nought—He takes unto Himself
a body, and that of no different sort from ours. 3. For He did not
simply will to become embodied, or will merely to appear <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) . For if He willed merely to appear,
He was able to effect His divine appearance by some other and higher
means as well. But He takes a body of our kind, and not merely so, but
from a spotless and stainless virgin, knowing not a man, a body clean
and in very truth pure from intercourse of men. For being Himself
mighty, and Artificer of everything, He prepares the body in the Virgin
as a temple unto Himself, and makes it His very own <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) as an instrument, in it manifested,
and in it dwelling. 4. And thus taking from our bodies one of like
nature, because all were under penalty of the corruption of death He
gave it over to death in the stead of all, and offered it to the
Father—doing this, moreover, of His loving-kindness, to the end that,
firstly, all being held to have died in Him, the law involving the ruin
of men might be undone (inasmuch as its power was fully spent in the
Lord’s body, and had no longer holding-ground against men, his peers),
and that, secondly, whereas men had turned toward corruption, He might
turn them again toward incorruption, and quicken them from death by the
appropriation <span id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) of His body and by
the grace of the Resurrection, banishing death from them like straw from
the fire <span id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) .

[Next: The Word, since death alone could stay the plague, took a mortal
body which, united with Him, should avail for all, and by partaking of
His immortality stay the corruption of the Race. By being above all, He
made His Flesh an offering for our souls; by being one with us all, he
clothed us with immortality. Simile to illustrate this.](2040106.md)
