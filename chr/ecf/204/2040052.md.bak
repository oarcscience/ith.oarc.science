<span id="vi.ii.i.vii-p1"></span> §7. *Refutation of dualism from
reason. Impossibility of two Gods. The truth as to evil is that which
the Church teaches: that it originates, and resides, in the perverted
choice of the darkened soul.*

<span id="vi.ii.i.vii-p2"></span>More especially, they are exposed to
the following reply. If visible things are the work of the evil god,
what is the work of the good God? for nothing is to be seen except the
work of the Artificer. Or what evidence is there that the good God
exists at all, if there are no works of His by which He may be known?
for by his works the artificer is known. 2. Or how could two principles
exist, contrary one to another: or what is it that divides them, for
them to exist apart? For it is impossible for them to exist together,
because they are mutually destructive. But neither can the one be
included in the other, their nature being unmixed and unlike.
Accordingly that which divides them will evidently be of a third nature,
and itself God. But of what nature could this third something be? good
or evil? It will be impossible to determine, for it cannot be of the
nature of both. 3. This conceit of theirs, then, being evidently rotten,
the truth of the Church’s theology must be manifest: that evil has not
from the beginning been with God or in God, nor has any substantive
existence; but that men, in default of the vision of good, began to
devise and imagine for themselves what was not, after their own
pleasure. 4. For as if a man, when the sun is shining, and the whole
earth illumined by his light, were to shut fast his eyes and imagine
darkness where no darkness exists, and then walk wandering as if in
darkness, often falling and going down steep places, thinking it was
dark and not light,—for, imagining that he sees, he does not see at
all;—so, too, the soul of man, shutting fast her eyes, by which she is
able to see God, has imagined evil for herself, and moving therein,
knows not that, thinking she is doing something, she is doing nothing.
For she is imagining what is not, nor is she abiding in her original
nature; but what she is is evidently the product of her own disorder. 5.
For she is made to see God, and to be enlightened by Him; but of her own
accord in God’s stead she has sought corruptible things and darkness, as
the Spirit says somewhere in writing, “God made man upright, but they
have sought out many inventions <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md)
.” Thus it has been then that men from the first discovered and
contrived and imagined evil for themselves. But it is now time to say
how they came down to the madness of idolatry, that you may know that
the invention of idols is wholly due, not to good but to evil. But what
has its origin in evil can never be pronounced good in any point,—being
evil altogether.

[Next: The origin of idolatry is similar. The soul, materialised by
forgetting God, and engrossed in earthly things, makes them into gods.
The race of men descends into a hopeless depth of delusion and
superstition.](2040053.md)
