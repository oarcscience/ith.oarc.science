<span id="xii.ii.iv-p1"></span> §4. *Outrages on Good Friday and Easter
Day, 339.*

<span id="xii.ii.iv-p2"></span>In addition to all this, after such a
notable and illustrious entry into the city, the Arian Gregory, taking
pleasure in these calamities, and as if desirous to secure to the
heathens and Jews, and those who had wrought these evils upon us, a
prize and price of their iniquitous success, gave up the church to be
plundered by them. Upon this license of iniquity and disorder, their
deeds were worse than in time of war, and more cruel than those of
robbers. Some of them were plundering whatever fell in their way; others
dividing among themselves the sums which some had laid up there <span
id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457) ; the wine, of which there was a large
quantity, they either drank or emptied out or carried away; they
plundered the store of oil, and every one took as his spoil the doors
and chancel rails; the candlesticks they forthwith laid aside in the
wall <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458) , and lighted the candles
of the Church before their idols: in a word, rapine and death pervaded
the Church. And the impious Arians, so far from feeling shame that such
things should be done, added yet further outrages and cruelty.
Presbyters and laymen had their flesh torn, virgins were stript of their
veils <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459) , and led away to the
tribunal of the governor, and then cast into prison; others had their
goods confiscated, and were scourged; the bread of the ministers and
virgins was intercepted. And these things were done even during the holy
season of Lent <span id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460) , about the time
of Easter; a time when the brethren were keeping fast, while this
notable Gregory exhibited the disposition of a Caiaphas, and, together
with Pilate the Governor, furiously raged against the pious worshippers
of Christ. Going into one of the churches on the Preparation <span
id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461) , in company with the Governor and the
heathen multitude, when he saw that the people regarded with abhorrence
his forcible entry among them, he caused that most cruel person, the
Governor, publicly to scourge in one hour, four and thirty virgins and
married women, and men of rank, and to cast them into prison. Among them
there was one virgin, who, being fond of study, had the Psalter in her
hands, at the time when he caused her to be publicly scourged: the book
was torn in pieces by the officers, and the virgin herself shut up in
prison.

<span id="xii.ii.iv-p3"></span> Churches, as heathen temples before
them, were used for deposits. At the sack of Rome, Alaric spared the
Churches and their possessions; nay, he himself transported the costly
vessels of St. Peter into his Church.
