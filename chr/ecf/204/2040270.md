<span id="xviii.ii.v-p1"></span> 5. *No possible time or place for the
alleged offence.*

<span id="xviii.ii.v-p2"></span>Now what place and time does my accuser
specify, at which I made use of these expressions according to his
slanderous imputation? In whose presence was I so mad as to give
utterance to the words which he has falsely charged me with speaking?
Who is there ready to support the charge, and to testify to the fact?
What his own eyes have seen that ought he to speak <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md) , as holy Scripture enjoins. But
no; he will find no witnesses of that which never took place. But I take
your Piety to witness, together with the Truth, that I lie not. I
request you, for I know you to be a person of excellent memory, to call
to mind the conversation I had with you, when you condescended to see
me, first at Viminacium <span id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md) , a
second time at Cæsarea in Cappadocia, and a third <span
id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md) time at Antioch. Did I speak evil
before you even of Eusebius and his fellows who had persecuted me? Did I
cast imputations upon any of those that have done me wrong? If then I
imputed nothing to any of those against whom I had a right to speak, how
could I be so possessed with madness as to slander an Emperor before an
Emperor, and to set a brother at variance with a brother? I beseech you,
either cause me to appear before you that the thing may be proved, or
else condemn these calumnies, and follow the example of David, who says,
‘Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I destroy <span
id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304.md) .’ As much as in them lies, they
have slain me; for ‘the mouth that belieth, slayeth the soul <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305.md) .’ But your long-suffering has
prevailed against them, and given me confidence to defend myself, that
they may suffer condemnation, as contentious and slanderous persons.
Concerning your most religious brother, of blessed memory, this may
suffice: for you will be able, according to the wisdom which God has
given you, to gather much from the little I have said, and to recognise
the fictitious charge.
