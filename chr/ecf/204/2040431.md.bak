<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>From Letter XXVIII <span

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xx-p3"></span>…<span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xx-p3.1"></span>In</span> order that while He might
become a sacrifice for us all, we, nourished up in the words of truth,
and partaking of His living doctrine, might be able with the saints to
receive also the joy of Heaven. For thither, as He called the disciples
to the upper chamber, so does the Word call us with them to the divine
and incorruptible banquet; having suffered for us here, but there,
preparing the heavenly tabernacles for those who most readily hearken to
the summons, and unceasingly, and \[gazing\] at the goal, pursue the
prize of their high calling; where for them who come to the banquet, and
strive with those who hinder them, there is laid up both a crown, and
incorruptible joy. For even though, humanly speaking, the labour of such
a journey is great, yet the Saviour Himself has rendered even it light
and kindly.
