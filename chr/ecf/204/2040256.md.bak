<span id="xvi.ii.xlv-p1"></span> 93. This is the end of Antony’s life in
the body <span id="page_221">p. 221</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.xlv-Page_221"></span>and the above was the beginning of the
discipline. Even if this account is small compared with his merit, still
from this reflect how great Antony, the man of God, was. Who from his
youth to so great an age preserved a uniform zeal for the discipline,
and neither through old age was subdued by the desire of costly food,
nor through the infirmity of his body changed the fashion of his
clothing, nor washed even his feet with water, and yet remained entirely
free from harm. For his eyes were undimmed and quite sound and he saw
clearly; of his teeth he had not lost one, but they had become worn to
the gums through the great age of the old man. He remained strong both
in hands and feet; and while all men were using various foods, and
washings and divers garments, he appeared more cheerful and of greater
strength. And the fact that his fame has been blazoned everywhere; that
all regard him with wonder, and that those who have never seen him long
for him, is clear proof of his virtue and God’s love of his soul. For
not from writings, nor from worldly wisdom, nor through any art, was
Antony renowned, but solely from his piety towards God. That this was
the gift of God no one will deny. For from whence into Spain and into
Gaul, how into Rome and Africa, was the man heard of who abode hidden in
a mountain, unless it was God who maketh His own known everywhere, who
also promised this to Antony at the beginning? For even if they work
secretly, even if they wish to remain in obscurity, yet the Lord shows
them as lamps to lighten all, that those who hear may thus know that the
precepts of God are able to make men prosper and thus be zealous in the
path of virtue.
