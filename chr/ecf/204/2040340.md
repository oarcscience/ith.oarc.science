<span id="xx.ii.vii"></span>

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c8"><span
id="xx.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>Part VII.</span>

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p2"></span><span class="c40"><span
id="xx.ii.vii-p2.1"></span>Persecution at Alexandria</span>

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p3"></span>47. ‘After’ he had accomplished all that
he desired against the Churches in Italy, and the other parts; after he
had banished some, and violently oppressed others, and filled every
place with fear, he at last turned his fury, as it had been some
pestilential disorder, against Alexandria. This was artfully contrived
by the enemies of Christ; for in order that they might have a show of
the signatures of many Bishops, and that Athanasius might not have a
single Bishop in his persecution to whom he could even complain, they
therefore anticipated his proceedings, and filled every place with
terror, which they kept up to second them in the prosecution of their
designs. But herein they perceived not through their folly that they
were not exhibiting the deliberate choice of the Bishops, but rather the
violence which themselves had employed; and that, although his brethren
should desert him, and his friends and acquaintance stand afar off, and
no one be found to sympathise with him and console him, yet far above
all these, a refuge with his God was sufficient for him. For Elijah also
was alone in his persecution, and God was all in all to the holy man.
And the Saviour has given us an example herein, who also was left alone,
and exposed to the designs of His enemies, to teach us, that when we are
persecuted and deserted by men, we must not faint, <span
id="page_288">p. 288</span> <span id="xx.ii.vii-Page_288"></span>but
place our hope in Him, and not betray the Truth. For although at first
truth may seem to be afflicted, yet even they who persecute shall
afterwards acknowledge it.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p4"></span>48. *Attacks upon the Alexandrian
Church.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p5"></span>Accordingly they urge on the Emperor, who
first writes a menacing letter, which he sends to the Duke and the
soldiers. The Notaries Diogenius and Hilarius <span
id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670.md) , and certain Palatines with them,
were the bearers of it; upon whose arrival those terrible and cruel
outrages were committed against the Church, which I have briefly related
a little above <span id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671.md) , and which
are known to all men from the protests put forth by the people, which
are inserted at the end of this history, so that any one may read them.
Then after these proceedings on the part of Syrianus, after these
enormities had been perpetrated, and violence offered to the Virgins, as
approving of such conduct and the infliction of these evils upon us, he
writes again to the senate and people of Alexandria, instigating the
younger men, and requiring them to assemble together, and either to
persecute Athanasius, or consider themselves as his enemies. He however
had withdrawn before these instructions reached them, and from the time
when Syrianus broke into the Church; for he remembered that which was
written, ‘Hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the
indignation be overpast <span id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672.md) .’
One Heraclius, by rank a Count, was the bearer of this letter, and the
precursor of a certain George that was despatched by the Emperor as a
spy, for one that was sent from him cannot be a Bishop <span
id="fr_1673"></span>[1674](#fn_1673.md) ; God forbid. And so indeed his
conduct and the circumstances which preceded his entrance sufficiently
prove.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p10"></span>49 and 50. *Hypocrisy of the pretended
respect of Constantius for his brother’s memory.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p11"></span>Heraclius then published the letter,
which reflected great disgrace upon the writer. For whereas, when the
great Hosius wrote to Constantius, he had been unable to make out any
plausible pretext for his change of conduct, he now invented an excuse
much more discreditable to himself and his advisers. He said, ‘From
regard to the affection I entertained towards my brother of divine and
pious memory, I endured for a time the coming of Athanasius among you.’
This proves that he has both broken his promise, and behaved
ungratefully to his brother after his death. He then declares him to be,
as indeed he is, ‘deserving of divine and pious remembrance;’ yet as
regards a command of his, or to use his own language, the ‘affection’ he
bore him, even though he complied merely ‘for the sake’ of the blessed
Constans, he ought to deal fairly by his brother, and make himself heir
to his sentiments as well as to the Empire. But, although, when seeking
to obtain his just rights, he deposed Vetranio, with the question, ‘To
whom does the inheritance belong after a brother’s death <span
id="fr_1674"></span>[1675](#fn_1674.md) ?’ yet for the sake of the accursed
heresy of the enemies of Christ, he disregards the claims of justice,
and behaves undutifully towards his brethren. Nay, for the sake of this
heresy, he would not consent to observe even his father’s wishes without
infringement; but, in what he may gratify these impious men, he pretends
to adopt his intention, while in order to distress the others, he cares
not to shew the reverence which is due unto a father. For in consequence
of the calumnies of Eusebius and his fellows, his father sent the Bishop
for a time into Gaul to avoid the cruelty of his persecutors (this was
shewn by the blessed Constantine, the brother of the former, after their
father’s death, as appears by his letters <span
id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675) .md), but he would not be persuaded by
Eusebius and his fellows to send the person whom they desired for a
Bishop, but prevented the accomplishment of their wishes, and put a stop
to their attempts with severe threats.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p14"></span>51. *How Constantius shews his respect
for his father and brother.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p15"></span>If therefore, as he declares in his
letters, he desired to observe his sire’s practice, why did he first
send out Gregory, and now this George, the eater of stores <span
id="fr_1676"></span>[1677](#fn_1676.md) ? Why does he endeavour so
earnestly to introduce into the Church these Arians, whom his father
named Porphyrians <span id="fr_1677"></span>[1678](#fn_1677.md) , and
banish others while he patronises them? Although his father admitted
Arius to his presence, yet when Arius perjured himself and burst
asunder <span id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678.md) he lost the
compassion of his father; who, on learning the truth, condemned him as
an heretic. Why moreover, while pretending to respect the Canon of the
Church, has he ordered the whole course of his conduct in opposition to
them? For where is there a Canon that a Bishop should be appointed from
Court? Where is there a Canon <span id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679.md)
that permits soldiers to invade Churches? What tradition is there
allowing counts and ignorant <span id="page_289">p. 289</span> <span
id="xx.ii.vii-Page_289"></span>eunuchs to exercise authority in
Ecclesiastical matters, and to make known by their edicts the decisions
of those who bear the name of Bishops? He is guilty of all manner of
falsehood for the sake of this unholy heresy. At a former time he sent
out Philagrius as Prefect a second time <span
id="fr_1680"></span>[1681](#fn_1680.md) , in opposition to the opinion of
his father, and we see what has taken place now. Nor ‘for his brother’s
sake’ does he speak the truth. For after his death he wrote not once nor
twice, but three times to the Bishop, and repeatedly promised him that
he would not change his behaviour towards him, but exhorted him to be of
good courage, and not suffer any one to alarm him, but to continue to
abide in his Church in perfect security. He also sent his commands by
Count Asterius, and Palladius the Notary, to Felicissimus, who was then
Duke, and to the Prefect Nestorius, that if either Philip the Prefect,
or any other should venture to form any plot against Athanasius, they
should prevent it.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p21"></span>52. *The Emperor has no right to rule
the Church.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p22"></span>Wherefore when Diogenes came, and
Syrianus laid in wait for us, both he and we <span
id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681.md) and the people demanded to see the
Emperor’s letters, supposing that, as it is written, ‘Let not a
falsehood be spoken before the king <span
id="fr_1682"></span>[1683](#fn_1682.md) ;’ so when a king has made a
promise, he will not lie, nor change. If then ‘for his brother’s sake he
complied,’ why did he also write those letters upon his death? And if he
wrote them for ‘his memory’s sake,’ why did he afterwards behave so very
unkindly towards him, and persecute the man, and write what he did,
alleging a judgment of Bishops, while in truth he acted only to please
himself? Nevertheless his craft has not escaped detection, but we have
the proof of it ready at hand. For if a judgment had been passed by
Bishops, what concern had the Emperor with it? Or if it was only a
threat of the Emperor, what need in that case was there of the so-named
Bishops? When was such a thing heard of before from the beginning of the
world? When did a judgment of the Church receive its validity from the
Emperor? or rather when was his decree ever recognised by the Church?
There have been many Councils held heretofore; and many judgments passed
by the Church; but the Fathers never sought the consent of the Emperor
thereto, nor did the Emperor busy himself with the affairs of the
Church <span id="fr_1683"></span>[1684](#fn_1683.md) . The Apostle Paul had
friends among them of Cæsar’s household, and in his Epistle to the
Philippians he sent salutations from them; but he never took them as his
associates in Ecclesiastical judgments. Now however we have witnessed a
novel spectacle, which is a discovery of the Arian heresy. Heretics have
assembled together with the Emperor Constantius, in order that he,
alleging the authority of the Bishops, may exercise his power against
whomsoever he pleases, and while he persecutes may avoid the name of
persecutor; and that they, supported by the Emperor’s government, may
conspire the ruin of whomsoever they will <span
id="fr_1684"></span>[1685](#fn_1684.md) and these are all such as are not
as impious as themselves. One might look upon their proceedings as a
comedy which they are performing on the stage, in which the pretended
Bishops are actors, and Constantius the performer of their behests, who
makes promises to them, as Herod did to the daughter of Herodias, and
they dancing before him accomplish through false accusations the
banishment and death of the true believers in the Lord.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p27"></span>53. *Despotic interference of
Constantius.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p28"></span>Who indeed has not been injured by their
calumnies? Whom have not these enemies of Christ conspired to destroy?
Whom has Constantius failed to banish upon charges which they have
brought against them? When did he refuse to hear them willingly? And
what is most strange, when did he permit any one to speak against them,
and did not more readily receive their testimony, of whatever kind it
might be? Where is there a Church which now enjoys the privilege of
worshipping Christ freely? If a Church be a maintainer of true piety, it
is in danger; if it dissemble, it abides in fear. Every place is full of
hypocrisy and impiety, so far as he is concerned; and wherever there is
a pious person and a lover of Christ (and there are many such
everywhere, as were the prophets and the great Elijah) they hide
themselves, if so be that they can find a faithful friend like Obadiah,
and either they withdraw into caves and dens of the earth, or pass their
lives in wandering about in the deserts. These men in their madness
prefer such calumnies against them <span id="page_290">p. 290</span>
<span id="xx.ii.vii-Page_290"></span>as Jezebel invented against Naboth,
and the Jews against the Saviour; while the Emperor, who is the patron
of the heresy, and wishes to pervert the truth, as Ahab wished to change
the vineyard into a garden of herbs, does whatever they desire him to
do, for the suggestions he receives from them are agreeable to his own
wishes.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p29"></span>54. *Constantius gives up the
Alexandrian Churches to the heretics.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p30"></span>Accordingly he banished, as I said
before the genuine Bishops, because they would not profess impious
doctrines, to suit his own pleasure; and so he now sent Count Heraclius
to proceed against Athanasius, who has publicly made known his decrees,
and announced the command of the Emperor to be, that unless they
complied with the instructions contained in his letters, their
bread <span id="fr_1685"></span>[1686](#fn_1685.md) should be taken away,
their idols overthrown, and the persons of many of the city-magistrates
and people delivered over to certain slavery. After threatening them in
this manner, he was not ashamed to declare publicly with a loud voice,
‘The Emperor disclaims Athanasius, and has commanded that the Churches
be given up to the Arians.’ And when all wondered to hear this, and made
signs to one another, exclaiming, ‘What! has Constantius become a
heretic?’ instead of blushing as he ought, the man all the more obliged
the senators and heathen magistrates and wardens <span
id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686.md) of the idol temples to subscribe to
these conditions, and to agree to receive as their Bishop
whomsoever <span id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687.md) the Emperor should
send them. Of course Constantius was strictly upholding the Canon of the
Church, when he caused this to be done; when instead of requiring
letters from the Church, he demanded them of the market-place, and
instead of the people he asked them of the wardens of the temples. He
was conscious that he was not sending a Bishop to preside over
Christians, but a certain intruder for those who subscribed to his
terms.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p34"></span>55. *Irruption into the great Church.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p35"></span>The Gentiles accordingly, as purchasing
by their compliance the safety of their idols, and certain of the
trades <span id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688.md) , subscribed, though
unwillingly, from fear of the threats which he had held out to them;
just as if the matter had been the appointment of a general, or other
magistrate. Indeed what as heathen, were they likely to do, except
whatever was pleasing to the Emperor? But the people having assembled in
the great Church (for it was the fourth day of the week), Count
Heraclius on the following day <span
id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689.md) takes with him Cataphronius the
Prefect of Egypt, and Faustinus the Receiver-General <span
id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690.md) , and Bithynus a heretic; and
together they stir up the younger men of the common multitude <span
id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691.md) who worshipped idols, to attack the
Church, and stone the people, saying that such was the Emperor’s
command. As the time of dismissal however had arrived, the greater part
had already left the Church, but there being a few women still
remaining, they did as the men had charged them, whereupon a piteous
spectacle ensued. The few women had just risen from prayer and had sat
down when the youths suddenly came upon them naked with stones and
clubs. Some of them the godless wretches stoned to death; they scourged
with stripes the holy persons of the Virgins, tore off their veils and
exposed their heads, and when they resisted the insult, the cowards
kicked them with their feet. This was dreadful, exceedingly dreadful;
but what ensued was worse, and more intolerable than any outrage.
Knowing the holy character of the virgins, and that their ears were
unaccustomed to pollution, and that they were better able to bear stones
and swords than expressions of obscenity, they assailed them with such
language. This the Arians suggested to the young men, and laughed at all
they said and did; while the holy Virgins and other godly women fled
from such words as they would from the bite of asps, but the enemies of
Christ assisted them in the work, nay even, it may be, gave utterance to
the same; for they were well-pleased with the obscenities which the
youths vented upon them.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p40"></span>56. *The great Church pillaged.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p41"></span>After this, that they might fully
execute the orders they had received (for this was what they earnestly
desired, and what the Count and the Receiver-General instructed them to
do), they seized upon the seats, the throne, and <span id="page_291">p.
291</span> <span id="xx.ii.vii-Page_291"></span>the table which was of
wood <span id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692.md) , and the curtains <span
id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693.md) of the Church, and whatever else
they were able, and carrying them out burnt them before the doors in the
great street, and cast frankincense upon the flame. Alas! who will not
weep to hear of these things, and, it may be, close his ears, that he
may not have to endure the recital, esteeming it hurtful merely to
listen to the account of such enormities? Moreover they sang the praises
of their idols, and said, ‘Constantius hath become a heathen, and the
Arians have acknowledged our customs;’ for indeed they scruple not even
to pretend heathenism, if only their heresy may be established. They
even were ready to sacrifice a heifer which drew the water for the
gardens in the Cæsareum <span id="fr_1694"></span>[1695](#fn_1694.md) ; and
would have sacrificed it, had it not been a female <span
id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695.md) ; for they said that it was
unlawful for such to be offered among them.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p46"></span>57. Thus acted the impious <span
id="fr_1696"></span>[1697](#fn_1696.md) Arians in conjunction with the
heathens, thinking that these things tended to our dishonour. But Divine
justice reproved their iniquity, and wrought a great and remarkable
sign, thereby plainly shewing to all men, that as in their acts of
impiety they had dared to attack none other but the Lord, so in these
proceedings also they were again attempting to do dishonour unto Him.
This was more manifestly proved by the marvellous event which now came
to pass. One of these licentious youths ran into the Church, and
ventured to sit down upon the throne; and as he sat there the wretched
man uttered with a nasal sound some lascivious song. Then rising up he
attempted to pull away the throne, and to drag it towards him; he knew
not that he was drawing down vengeance upon himself. For as of old the
inhabitants of Azotus, when they ventured to touch <span
id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697.md) the Ark, which it was not lawful
for them even to look upon, were immediately destroyed by it, being
first grievously tormented by emerods; so this unhappy person who
presumed to drag the throne, drew it upon himself, and, as if Divine
justice had sent the wood to punish him, he struck it into his own
bowels; and instead of carrying out the throne, he brought out by his
blow his own entrails; so that the throne took away his life, instead of
his taking it away. For, as it is <span
id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698.md) written of Judas, his bowels gushed
out; and he fell down and was carried away, and the day after he died.
Another also entered the Church with boughs of trees <span
id="fr_1699"></span>[1700](#fn_1699.md) and, as in the Gentile manner he
waved them in his hands and mocked, he was immediately struck with
blindness, so as straightway to lose his sight, and to know no longer
where he was; but as he was about to fall, he was taken by the hand and
supported by his companions out of the place, and when on the following
day he was with difficulty brought to his senses, he knew not either
what he had done or suffered in consequence of his audacity.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p51"></span>58. *General Persecution at Alexandria.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p52"></span>The Gentiles, when they beheld these
things, were seized with fear, and ventured on no further outrage; but
the Arians were not even yet touched with shame, but, like the Jews when
they saw the miracles, were faithless and would not believe, nay, like
Pharaoh, they were hardened; they too having placed their hopes below,
on the Emperor and his eunuchs. They permitted the Gentiles, or rather
the more abandoned of the Gentiles, to act in the manner before
described; for they found that Faustinus, who is the Receiver-General by
style, but is a vulgar <span id="fr_1700"></span>[1701](#fn_1700.md) person
in habits, and profligate in heart, was ready to play his part with them
in these proceedings, and to stir up the heathen. Nay, they undertook to
do the like themselves, that as they had modelled their heresy upon all
other heresies together <span id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701.md) , so
they might share their wickedness with the more depraved of mankind.
What they did through the instrumentality of others I described above;
the enormities they committed themselves surpass the bounds of all
wickedness; and they exceed the malice of any hangman. Where is there a
house which they did not ravage? where is there a family they did not
plunder on pretence of searching for their opponents? where is there a
garden they did not trample under foot? what tomb <span
id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702.md) did they not open, pretending they
were seeking for Athanasius, though their sole object was to plunder and
spoil all that came in their way? How many men’s houses were sealed
up <span id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703.md) ! The contents of how many
persons’ lodgings did they give away to the soldiers who assis<span
id="page_292">p. 292</span> <span id="xx.ii.vii-Page_292"></span>ted
them! Who had not experience of their wickedness? Who that met them but
was obliged to hide himself in the market-place? Did not many an one
leave his house from fear of them, and pass the night in the desert? Did
not many an one, while anxious to preserve his property from them, lose
the greater part of it? And who, however inexperienced of the sea, did
not choose rather to commit himself to it, and to risk all its dangers,
than to witness their threatenings? Many also changed their residences,
and removed from street to street, and from the city to the suburbs. And
many submitted to severe fines, and when they were unable to pay,
borrowed of others, merely that they might escape their machinations.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p57"></span>59. *Violence of Sebastianus.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p58"></span>For they made themselves formidable to
all men, and treated all with great arrogance, using the name of the
Emperor, and threatening them with his displeasure. They had to assist
them in their wickedness the Duke Sebastianus, a Manichee, and a
profligate young man; the <span id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704.md)
Prefect, the Count, and the Receiver-General as a dissembler. Many
Virgins who condemned their impiety, and professed the truth, they
brought out from the houses; others they insulted as they walked along
the streets, and caused their heads to be uncovered by their young men.
They also gave permission to the females of their party to insult whom
they chose; and although the holy and faithful women withdrew on one
side, and gave them the way, yet they gathered round them like
Bacchanals and Furies <span id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705.md) , and
esteemed it a misfortune if they found no means to injure them, and
spent that day sorrowfully on which they were unable to do them some
mischief. In a word, so cruel and bitter were they against all, that all
men called them hangmen, murderers, lawless, intruders, evil-doers, and
by any other name rather than that of Christians.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p61"></span>60. *Martyrdom of Eutychius.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p62"></span>Moreover, imitating the savage practices
of Scythians, they seized upon Eutychius a Subdeacon, a man who had
served the Church honourably, and causing him to be scourged on the back
with a leather whip, till he was at the point of death, they demanded
that her should be sent away to the mines; and not simply to any mine,
but to that of Phæno <span id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706.md) , where
even a condemned murderer is hardly able to live a few days. And what
was most unreasonable in their conduct, they would not permit him even a
few hours to have his wounds dressed, but caused him to be sent off
immediately, saying, ‘If this is done, all men will be afraid, and
henceforward will be on our side.’ After a short interval, however,
being unable to accomplish his journey to the mine on account of the
pain of his stripes, he died on the way. He perished rejoicing, having
obtained the glory of martyrdom. But the miscreants were not even yet
ashamed, but in the words of Scripture, ‘having bowels without
mercy <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707.md) ,’ they acted
accordingly, and now again perpetrated a satanic deed. When the people
prayed them to spare Eutychius and besought them for him, they caused
four honourable and free citizens to be seized, one of whom was Hermias
who washed the beggars’ feet <span id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708.md)
; and after scourging them very severely, the Duke cast them into the
prison. But the Arians, who are more cruel even than Scythians, when
they had seen that they did not die from the stripes they had received,
complained of the Duke and threatened, saying, ‘We will write and tell
the eunuchs <span id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709.md) , that he does
not flog as we wish.’ Hearing this he was afraid, and was obliged to
beat the men a second time; and they being beaten, and knowing for what
cause they suffered and by whom they had been accused, said only, ‘We
are beaten for the sake of the Truth, but we will not hold communion
with the heretics: beat us now as thou wilt; God will judge thee for
this.’ The impious men wished to expose them to danger in the prison,
that they might die there; but the people of God observing their time,
besought him for them, and after seven days or more they were set at
liberty.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p67"></span>61. *Ill-treatment of the poor.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p68"></span>But the Arians, as being grieved at
this, again devised another yet more cruel and unholy deed; cruel in the
eyes of all men, but well suited to their antichristian heresy. The Lord
commanded that we should remember the poor; He said, ‘Sell that ye have,
and give alms’ and again ‘I was a hungred, and ye gave Me meat; I was
thirsty, and ye gave Me drink; for inasmuch as ye have done it unto
<span id="page_293">p. 293</span> <span
id="xx.ii.vii-Page_293"></span>one of these little ones, ye have done it
unto Me <span id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710.md) .’ But these men, as
being in truth opposed to Christ, have presumed to act contrary to His
will in this respect also. For when the Duke gave up the Churches to the
Arians, and the destitute persons and widows were unable to continue any
longer in them, the widows sat down in places which the Clergy entrusted
with the care of them appointed. And when the Arians saw that the
brethren readily ministered unto them and supported them, they
persecuted the widows also, beating them on the feet, and accused those
who gave to them before the Duke. This was done by means of a certain
soldier named Dynamius. And it was well-pleasing to Sebastian <span
id="fr_1711"></span>[1712](#fn_1711.md) , for there is no mercy in the
Manichæans; nay, it is considered a hateful thing among them to shew
mercy to a poor man <span id="fr_1712"></span>[1713](#fn_1712.md) . Here
then was a novel subject of complaint; and a new kind of court now first
invented by the Arians. Persons were brought to trial for acts of
kindness which they had performed; he who shewed mercy was accused, and
he who had received a benefit was beaten; and they wished rather that a
poor man should suffer hunger, than that he who was willing to shew
mercy should give to him. Such sentiments these modern Jews, for such
they are, have learned from the Jews of old, who when they saw him who
had been blind from his birth recover his sight, and him who had been a
long time sick of the palsy made whole, accused <span
id="fr_1713"></span>[1714](#fn_1713.md) the Lord who had bestowed these
benefits upon them, and judged them to be transgressors who had
experienced His goodness <span id="fr_1714"></span>[1715](#fn_1714.md) .

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p74"></span>62. *Ill-treatment of the poor.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p75"></span>Who was not struck with astonishment at
these proceedings? Who did not execrate both the heresy, and its
defenders? Who failed to perceive that the Arians are indeed more cruel
than wild beasts? For they had no prospect of gain <span
id="fr_1715"></span>[1716](#fn_1715.md) from their iniquity, for the sake
of which they might have acted in this manner; but they rather increased
the hatred of all men against themselves. They thought by treachery and
terror to force certain persons into their heresy, so that they might be
brought to communicate with them; but the event turned out quite the
contrary. The sufferers endured as martyrdom whatever they inflicted
upon them, and neither betrayed nor denied the true faith in Christ. And
those who were without and witnessed their conduct, and at last even the
heathen, when they saw these things, execrated them as antichristian, as
cruel executioners; for human nature is prone to pity and sympathise
with the poor. But these men have lost even the common sentiments of
humanity; and that kindness which they would have desired to meet with
at the hands of others, had themselves been sufferers, they would not
permit others to receive, but employed against them the severity and
authority of the magistrates, and especially of the Duke.

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p77"></span>63. *Ill-treatment of the Presbyters and
Deacons.*

<span id="xx.ii.vii-p78"></span>What they have done to the Presbyters
and Deacons; how they drove them into banishment under sentence passed
upon them by the Duke and the magistrates, causing the soldiers to bring
out their kinsfolk from the houses <span
id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716.md) , and Gorgonius, the commander of
the police <span id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717.md) to beat them with
stripes; and how (most cruel act of all) with much insolence they
plundered the loaves <span id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718.md) of these
and of those who were now dead; these things it is impossible for words
to describe, for their cruelty surpasses all the powers of language.
What terms could one employ which might seem equal to the subject? What
circumstances could one mention first, so that those next recorded would
not be found more dreadful, and the next more dreadful still? All their
attempts and iniquities <span id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719.md) were
full of murder and impiety; and so unscrupulous and artful are they,
that they endeavour to deceive by promises of protection, and by bribing
with money <span id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720.md) , that so, since
they cannot recommend themselves by fair means, they may thereby make
some display to impose on the simple.

had done \[the parallels refute this, apart from linguistic grounds\].
