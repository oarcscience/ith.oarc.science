<span id="vii.ii.xxxix-p1"></span> §39. *Do you look for another? But
Daniel foretells the exact time. Objections to this removed.*

<span id="vii.ii.xxxix-p2"></span>But perhaps, being unable, even they,
to fight continually against plain facts, they will, without denying
what is written, maintain that they are looking for these things, and
that the Word of God is not yet come. For this it is on which they are
for ever harping, not blushing to brazen it out in the face of plain
facts. 2. But on this one point, above all, they shall be all the more
refuted, not at our hands, but at those of the most wise Daniel, who
marks both the actual date, and the divine sojourn of the Saviour,
saying: “Seventy <span id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302) weeks are cut
short upon thy people, and upon the holy city, for a full end to be made
of sin, and for sins to be sealed up, and to blot out iniquities, and to
make atonement for iniquities, and to bring everlasting righteousness,
and to seal vision and prophet, and to anoint a Holy of Holies; and thou
shalt know and understand from the going forth of the word to
restore <span id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303) and to build Jerusalem
unto Christ the Prince” 3. Perhaps with regard to the other (prophecies)
they may be able even to find excuses and to put off what is written to
a future time. But what can they say to this, or can they face it at
all? Where not only is the Christ referred to, but He that is to be
anointed is declared to be not man simply, but Holy of Holies; and
Jerusalem is to stand till His coming, and thenceforth, prophet and
vision cease in Israel. 4. David was anointed of old, and Solomon and
Ezechias; but then, nevertheless, Jerusalem and the place stood, and
prophets were prophesying: God and Asaph and Nathan; and, later, Esaias
and Osee and Amos and others. And again, the actual men that were
anointed were called holy, and not Holy of Holies. 5. But if they shield
themselves with the captivity, and say that because of it Jerusalem was
not, what can they say about the prophets too? For in fact when first
the people went down to Babylon, Daniel and Jeremy were there, and
Ezechiel and Aggæus and Zachary were prophesying.

Jerusalem, (2) from the conversion of the Gentiles, and that to the God

done?](2040137)
