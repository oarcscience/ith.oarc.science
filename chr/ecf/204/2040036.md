<span id="v.v.i-p3"></span>§1. *Sources.*

<span id="v.v.i-p4"></span>(1) The *Festal Letters* of Athanasius with
their *Index* and the *Historia Acephala* constitute our primary source
for chronological details (see below, §2). (2) Along with these come the
chronological notices scattered up and down the other writings of
Athanasius. These are of course of the utmost importance, but too often
lack definiteness. (3) The chronological data in the fifth-century
historians, headed by Socrates, are a mass of confusion, and have been a
source of confusion ever since, until the discovery of the primary
sources, No. (1) mentioned above. They must, therefore, be used only in
strict subordination to the latter. (4) More valuable but less abundant
secondary notices are to be derived from the Life of Pachomius, from the
letter of Ammon (*infra*, p. 487), and from other writers of the day.
(5) For the movements of the Emperors the laws in the *Codex
Theodosianus* (ed. Hänel in *Corpus Juris Ante-Justiniani*) give many
dates, but the text is not in a satisfactory condition.

<span id="v.v.i-p5"></span>(6) *Modern discussions*. The conflicting
attempts at an Athanasian chronology prior to the discovery of the
Festal Letters are tabulated in the Appendix to Newman’s *Arians*, and
discussed by him in his introduction to the *Historical Tracts* (Oxf.
Lib. Fathers). The notes to Dr. Bright’s article <span class="c10"><span
id="v.v.i-p5.1"></span>Athanasius</span> in D.C.B., and his introduction
to the *Hist. Writings of S. Ath*., may be profitably consulted, as also
may Larsow’s *Fest-briefe* (Leipz., 1852), with useful calendar
information by Dr. J. G. Galle, the veteran professor of Astronomy at
Breslau, and Sievers on the *Hist. Aceph*. (*Supr*. ch. i. §3.)

<span id="v.v.i-p6"></span>But by far the most valuable chronological
discussions are those of Prof. Gwatkin in his *Studies of Arianism*. He
has been the first to make full use of the best data, and moreover gives
very useful lists of the great officials of the Empire and of the
movements of the Eastern Emperors. Mr. Gwatkin’s results were criticised
in the *Church Quarterly Review*, vol. xvi. pp. 392–398, 1883, by an
evidently highly-qualified hand <span id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) .
The criticisms of the Reviewer have been most carefully weighed by the
present writer, although they quite fail to shake him in his general
agreement with Mr. Gwatkin’s results.

<span id="v.v.i-p8"></span><span id="page_lxxxi">p. lxxxi</span> <span
id="v.v.i-Page_lxxxi"></span>For the general chronology of the period we
may mention Weingarten’s *Zeit-tafeln* (ed. 3, 1888) as useful, though
not especially so for our purpose, and above all Clinton’s *Fasti
Romani*, which, however, were drawn up in the dark ages before the
discovery of the *Festal Letters*, and are therefore antiquated so far
as the life of Athanasius is concerned.

### Footnotes

id="v.v.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p7"></span> The candid, but friendly, and often just,
criticisms on Mr. Gwatkin’s book do not concern us here. But the
Reviewer’s chronological strictures are his weakest point: he uses his
texts without criticism, and falls far short of Mr. Gwatkin’s standard
of searching historical method.
