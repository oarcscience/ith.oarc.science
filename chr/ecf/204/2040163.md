<span id="x.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="x.i-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="x.i-p3.1"></span>The</span> date of this highly interesting document
is quite uncertain, but there is every ground for placing it earlier
than the explicitly anti-Arian treatises. Firstly, the absence of any
express reference to the controversy against Arians, while yet it is
clearly in view in §§3 and 4, which lay down the rule afterwards
consistently adopted by Athanasius with regard to texts which speak of
the Saviour as created. Secondly, the untroubled use of <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.i-p3.2"></span>ὅ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.i-p3.3"></span>μοιος</span> (§1, note 4) to
express the Son’s relation to the Father. Thirdly, the close affinity of
this Statement to the *Sermo Major de Fide* which in its turn has very
close points of contact with the pre-Arian treatises. But see Prolegg.
ch. iii. §1 (37).

<span id="x.i-p4"></span>If we are to hazard a conjecture, we may see in
this “<span class="Greek"><span id="x.i-p4.1"></span>ἔ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.i-p4.2"></span>κθεσις</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.i-p4.3"></span>”</span> a statement of faith
published by Athanasius upon his accession to the Episcopate, <span
class="c10"><span id="x.i-p4.4"></span>a.d.</span> 328. The statement
proper (Hahn §119) consists of §1. §§2–4 are an explanatory comment
insisting on the distinct Existence of the Son, and on His essential
uncreatedness.

<span id="x.i-p5"></span>The translation which follows has been
carefully compared with one made by the late Prof. Swainson in his work
on the Creeds, pp. 73–76. Dr. Swainson there refers to a former
‘imperfect and misleading’ translation (in Irons’ *Athanasius contra
Mundum*) which the present editor has not seen. Dr. Swainson expresses
doubts as to the Athanasian authorship of the Ecthesis, but without any
cogent reason. The only point of importance is one which acquaintance
with the usual language of Athanasius shews to make distinctly in favour
of, and not against, the genuineness of this little tract. Three times
in the course of it the Human Body, or Humanity of the Lord is spoken of
as <span class="Greek"><span id="x.i-p5.1"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.i-p5.2"></span>Κυριακός ἄνθρωπυς</span>. Dr.
Swainson exaggerates the strangeness of the expression by the barbarous
rendering ‘*Lordly* man’ (How would he translate <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.i-p5.3"></span>κυριακὸν δεῖπνον</span>?). But
the phrase certainly requires explanation, although the explanation is
not difficult. (1) It is quoted by Facundus of Hermiane from the present
work (*Def. Tr. Cap.* xi. 5), and by Rufinus from an unnamed work of
Athanasius (‘libellus’), probably the present one. Moreover, Athanasius
himself uses the phrase, frequently in the *Sermo Major de Fide,* and in
his exposition of [Psalm xl.](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#000)<span
id="x.i-p5.4"></span> (xli.). Epiphanius uses it at least twice
(*Ancor.* 78 and 95); and from these Greek Fathers the phrase
(‘Dominicus Homo’) passed on to Latin writers such as Cassian and
Augustine (below, note 5), who, however, subsequently cancelled his
adoption of the expression (*Retr.* I. xix. 8). The phrase, therefore,
is not to be objected to as un-Athanasian. In fact (2) it is founded
upon the profuse and characteristic use by Ath. of the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.i-p5.5"></span>ἄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.i-p5.6"></span>νθρωπος</span> to designate the
manhood of our Lord (see *Orat. c. Ar.* i. 41, 45, ii. 45, note 2. Dr.
Swainson appears unaware of this in his unsatisfactory paragraph p. 77,
lines 14 and foll.). If the human nature of Christ may be called <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.i-p5.7"></span>ἄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.i-p5.8"></span>νθρωπος</span> ([1 Tim. ii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005)<span id="x.i-p5.9"></span>) at all,
there is no difficulty in its being called <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.i-p5.10"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.i-p5.11"></span>ἄνθρ. τοῦ σωτῆρος</span> (*Serm. M. de F.* 24 and
30), or <span class="Greek"><span id="x.i-p5.12"></span>κυριακὸς
ἄνθρωπος</span>, a phrase equated with <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.i-p5.13"></span>τὸ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.i-p5.14"></span>\[</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="x.i-p5.15"></span>κυριακὸν</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="x.i-p5.16"></span>\]</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.i-p5.17"></span>σῶμα</span> in *Serm. M. de F.* 19 and 28–31 (see
also a discussion in Thilo *Athan. Opp. Dogm. select.* p. 2). This use
of the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.i-p5.18"></span>ἄ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="x.i-p5.19"></span>νθρωπος</span>, if carelessly employed, might lend
itself to a Nestorian sense. But Athanasius does not employ it
carelessly, nor in an ambiguous context; although of course he might
have used different language had he foreseen the controversies of the
fifth century. At any rate, enough has been said to shew that its use in
the present treatise does not expose its genuineness to cavil.
