<span id="xxv.iii.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Letter V</span>.—*For 333.
Easter-day* <span id="fr_4049"></span>[4050](#fn_4049.md) *, Coss.
Dalmatius and Zenophilus; Præfect, Paternus <span
id="fr_4050"></span>[4051](#fn_4050.md) ; vi Indict.; xvii Kal. Maii, xx
Pharmuthi; xv Moon; vii Gods; Æra Dioclet. 49.*

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.v-p4"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.v-p4.1"></span>We</span> duly proceed, my brethren, from
feasts to feasts, duly from prayers to prayers, we advance from fasts to
fasts, and join holy-days to holy-days. Again the time has arrived which
brings to us a new beginning <span id="fr_4051"></span>[4052](#fn_4051.md)
, even the announcement of the blessed Passover, in which the Lord was
sacrificed. We eat, as it were, the food of life, and constantly
thirsting we delight our souls at all times, as from a fountain, in His
precious blood. For we continually and ardently desire; He stands ready
for those who thirst; and for those who thirst there is the word of our
Saviour, which, in His loving-kindness, He uttered on the day of the
feast; ‘If any man thirst, let him come to Me and drink <span
id="fr_4052"></span>[4053](#fn_4052.md) .’ Nor was it then alone when any
one drew near to Him, that He cured his thirst; but whenever any one
seeks, there is free access for him to the Saviour. For the grace of the
feast is not limited to one time, nor does its splendid brilliancy
decline; but it is always near, enlightening the minds of those who
earnestly desire it <span id="fr_4053"></span>[4054](#fn_4053.md) . For
therein is constant virtue, for those who are illuminated in their
minds, and meditate on the divine Scriptures day and night, like the man
to whom a blessing is given, as it is written in the sacred Psalms;
‘Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,
nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of corrupters. But
his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law doth he meditate
day and night <span id="fr_4054"></span>[4055](#fn_4054.md) .’ For it is
not the sun, or the moon, or the host of those other stars which
illumines him, but he glitters with the high effulgence of God over all.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.v-p9"></span>2. For it is God, my beloved, even
the God Who at first established the feast for us, Who vouchsafes the
celebration of it year by year. He both brought about the slaying of His
Son for salvation, and gave us this reason for the holy feast, to which
every year bears witness, as often as at this season the feast is
proclaimed. This also leads us on from the cross through this world to
that which is before us, and God produces even now from it the <span
id="page_518">p. 518</span> <span id="xxv.iii.iii.v-Page_518"></span>joy
of glorious salvation, bringing us to the same assembly, and in every
place uniting all of us in spirit; appointing us common prayers, and a
common grace proceeding from the feast. For this is the marvel of His
loving-kindness, that He should gather together in the same place those
who are at a distance; and make those who appear to be far off in the
body, to be near together in unity of spirit.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.v-p10"></span>3. Wherefore then, my beloved, do we
not acknowledge the grace as becometh the feast? Wherefore do we not
make a return to our Benefactor? It is indeed impossible to make an
adequate return to God; still, it is a wicked thing for us who receive
the gracious gift, not to acknowledge it. Nature itself manifests our
inability; but our own will reproves our unthankfulness. Therefore the
blessed Paul, when admiring the greatness of the gift of God, said, ‘And
who is sufficient for these things <span
id="fr_4055"></span>[4056](#fn_4055.md) ?’ For He made the world free by
the blood of the Saviour; then, again, He has caused the grave to be
trodden down by the Saviour’s death, and furnished a way to the heavenly
gates free from obstacles to those who are going up <span
id="fr_4056"></span>[4057](#fn_4056.md) . Wherefore, one of the saints,
while he acknowledged the grace, but was insufficient to repay it, said,
‘What shall I render unto the Lord for all He has done unto me <span
id="fr_4057"></span>[4058](#fn_4057.md) ?’ For instead of death he had
received life, instead of bondage <span
id="fr_4058"></span>[4059](#fn_4058.md) , freedom, and instead of the
grave, the kingdom of heaven. For of old time, ‘death reigned from Adam
to Moses;’ but now the divine voice hath said, ‘To-day shalt thou be
with Me in Paradise.’ And the saints, being sensible of this, said,
‘Except the Lord had helped me, my soul had almost dwelt in hell. <span
id="fr_4059"></span>[4060](#fn_4059.md) .’ Besides all this, being
powerless to make a return, he yet acknowledged the gift, and wrote
finally, saying, ‘I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name
of the Lord; precious in His sight is the death of His saints <span
id="fr_4060"></span>[4061](#fn_4060.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.v-p17"></span>With regard to the cup, the Lord
said, ‘Are ye able to drink of that cup which I am about to drink of?’
And when the disciples assented, the Lord said, ‘Ye shall indeed drink
of My cup; but that ye should sit on My right hand, and on My left, is
not Mine to give; but to those for whom it is prepared <span
id="fr_4061"></span>[4062](#fn_4061.md) .’ Therefore, my beloved, let us be
sensible of the gift, though we are found insufficient to repay it. As
we have ability, let us meet the occasion. For although nature is not
able, with things unworthy of the Word, to return a recompense for such
benefits, yet let us render Him thanks while we persevere in piety. And
how can we more abide in piety than when we acknowledge God, Who in His
love to mankind has bestowed on us such benefits? (For thus we shall
obediently keep the law, and observe its commandments. And, further, we
shall not, as unthankful persons, be accounted transgressors of the law,
or do those things which ought to be hated, for the Lord loveth the
thankful); when too we offer ourselves to the Lord, like the saints,
when we subscribe ourselves entirely \[as\] living henceforth not to
ourselves, but to the Lord Who died for us, as also the blessed Paul
did, when he said, ‘I am crucified with Christ, yet I live; yet not I,
but Christ liveth in me <span id="fr_4062"></span>[4063](#fn_4062.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.v-p20"></span>4. Now our life, my brethren, truly
consists in our denying all bodily things, and continuing stedfast in
those only of our Saviour. Therefore the present season requires of us,
that we should not only utter such words, but should also imitate the
deeds of the saints. But we imitate them, when we acknowledge Him who
died, and no longer live unto ourselves, but Christ henceforth lives in
us; when we render a recompense to the Lord to the utmost of our power,
though when we make a return we give nothing of our own, but those
things which we have before received from Him, this being especially of
His grace, that He should require, as from us, His own gifts. He bears
witness to this when He says, ‘My offerings are My own gifts <span
id="fr_4063"></span>[4064](#fn_4063.md) .’ That is, those things which you
give Me are yours, as having received them from Me, but they are the
gifts of God. And let us offer to the Lord every virtue, and that true
holiness which is in Him, and in piety let us keep the feast to Him with
those things which He has hallowed for us. Let us thus engage in the
holy fasts, as having been prescribed by Him, and by means of which we
find the way to God. But let us not be like the heathen, or the ignorant
Jews, or as the heretics and schismatics of the present time. For the
heathen think the accomplishment of the feast is in the abundance of
food; the Jews, erring in the type and shadow, think it still such; the
schismatics keep it in separate places, and with vain imaginations. But
let us, my brethren, be superior to the heathen, in keeping the feast
with sincerity of soul, and purity of body; to the Jews, in no longer
receiving the type and the shadow, but <span id="page_519">p. 519</span>
<span id="xxv.iii.iii.v-Page_519"></span>as having been gloriously
illumined with the light of truth, and as looking upon the Sun of
Righteousness <span id="fr_4064"></span>[4065](#fn_4064.md) ; to the
schismatics, in not rending the coat of Christ, but in one house, even
in the Catholic Church, let us eat the Passover of the Lord, Who, by
ordaining His holy laws, guided us towards virtue, and counselled the
abstinence of this feast. For the Passover is indeed abstinence from
evil for exercise of virtue, and a departure from death unto life. This
may be learnt even from the type of old time. For then they toiled
earnestly to pass from Egypt to Jerusalem, but now we depart from death
to life; they then passed from Pharaoh to Moses, but now we rise from
the devil to the Saviour. And as, at that time, the type of deliverance
bore witness every year, so now we commemorate our salvation. We fast
meditating on death, that we may be able to live; and we watch, not as
mourners, but as they that wait for the Lord, when He shall have
returned from the wedding, so that we may vie with each other in the
triumph, hastening to announce the sign of victory over death.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.v-p23"></span>5. Would therefore, O my beloved,
that as the word requires, we might here so govern ourselves at all
times and entirely, and so live, as never to forget the noble acts of
God, nor to depart from the practice of virtue! As also the Apostolic
voice exhorts; ‘Remember Jesus Christ, that He rose from the dead <span
id="fr_4065"></span>[4066](#fn_4065.md) .’ Not that any limited season of
remembrance was appointed, for at all times He should be in our
thoughts. But because of the slothfulness of many, we delay from day to
day. Let us then begin in these days. To this end a time of remembrance
is permitted, that it may show forth to the saints the reward of their
calling, and may exhort the careless while reproving them <span
id="fr_4066"></span>[4067](#fn_4066.md) . Therefore in all the remaining
days, let us persevere in virtuous conduct, repenting as is our duty, of
all that we have neglected, whatever it may be; for there is no one free
from defilement, though his course may have been but one hour on the
earth, as Job, that man of surpassing fortitude, testifies. But,
‘stretching forth to those things that are to come <span
id="fr_4067"></span>[4068](#fn_4067.md) ,’ let us pray that we may not eat
the Passover unworthily, lest we be exposed to dangers. For to those who
keep the feast in purity, the Passover is heavenly food; but to those
who observe it profanely and contemptuously, it is a danger and
reproach. For it is written, ‘Whosoever shall eat and drink unworthily,
is guilty of the death of our Lord <span
id="fr_4068"></span>[4069](#fn_4068.md) .’ Wherefore, let us not merely
proceed to perform the festal rites, but let us be prepared to draw near
to the divine Lamb, and to touch heavenly food. Let us cleanse our
hands, let us purify the body. Let us keep our whole mind from guile;
not giving up ourselves to excess, and to lusts, but occupying ourselves
entirely with our Lord, and with divine doctrines; so that, being
altogether pure, we may be able to partake of the Word. <span
id="fr_4069"></span>[4070](#fn_4069.md)

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.v-p29"></span>6. We begin the holy fast on the
fourteenth of Pharmuthi (Apr. 9), on the \[first\] evening of the
week <span id="fr_4070"></span>[4071](#fn_4070.md) ; and having ceased on
the nineteenth of the same month Pharmuthi (Apr. 14), the first day of
the holy week dawns upon us on the twentieth of the same month Pharmuthi
(Apr. 15), to which we join the seven weeks of Pentecost; with prayers,
and fellowship with our neighbour, and love towards one another, and
that peaceable will which is above all. For so shall we be heirs of the
kingdom of heaven, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom to the
Father be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. All the brethren
who are with me salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.v-p31"></span>Here endeth the fifth Festal Letter
of holy Athanasius.
