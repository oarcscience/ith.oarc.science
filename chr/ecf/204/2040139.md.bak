<span id="vii.ii.xlii-p1"></span> §42. *His union with the body is based
upon His relation to Creation as a whole. He used a human body, since to
man it was that He wished to reveal Himself.*

<span id="vii.ii.xlii-p2"></span>For just as, while the whole body is
quickened and illumined by man, supposing one said it were absurd that
man’s power should also be in the toe, he would be thought foolish;
because, while granting that he pervades and works in the whole, he
demurs to his being in the part also; thus he who grants and believes
that the Word of God is in the whole Universe, and that the whole is
illumined and moved by Him, should not think it absurd that a single
human body also should receive movement and light from Him. 2. But if it
is because the human race is a thing created and has been made out of
nothing, that they regard that manifestation of the Saviour in man,
which we speak of, as not seemly, it is high time for them to eject Him
from creation also; for it too has been brought into existence by the
Word out of nothing. 3. But if, even though creation be a thing made, it
is not absurd that the Word should be in it, then neither is it absurd
that He should be in man. For whatever idea they form of the whole, they
must necessarily apply the like idea to the part. For man also, as I
said before, is a part of the whole. 4. Thus it is not at all unseemly
that the Word should be in man, while all things are deriving from Him
their light and movement and light, as also their authors say, “In <span
id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) him we live and move and have our
being.” 5. So, then, what is there to scoff at in what we say, if the
Word has used that, wherein He is, as an instrument to manifest Himself?
For were He not in it, neither could He have used it; but if we have
previously allowed that He is in the whole and in its parts, what is
there incredible in His manifesting Himself in that wherein He is? 6.
For by His own power He is united <span
id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md) wholly with each and all, and orders
all things without stint, so that no one could have called it out of
place for Him to speak, and make known Himself and His Father, by means
of sun, if He so willed, or moon, or heaven, or earth, or waters, or
fire <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) ; inasmuch as He holds in
one all things at once, and is in fact not only in all but also in the
part in question, and there invisibly manifests Himself. In like manner
it cannot be absurd if, ordering as He does the whole, and giving life
to all things, and having willed to make Himself known through men, He
has used as His instrument a human body to manifest the truth and
knowledge of the Father. For humanity, too, is an actual part of the
whole. 7. And as Mind, pervading man all through, is interpreted by a
part of the body, I mean the tongue, without any one saying, I suppose,
that the essence of the mind is on that account lowered, so if the Word,
pervading all things, has used a human instrument, this cannot appear
unseemly. For, as I have said previously, if it be unseemly to have used
a body as an instrument, it is unseemly also for Him to be in the Whole.

[Next: He came in human rather than in any nobler form, because (I) He
came to save, not to impress ; (2) man alone of creatures had sinned. As
men would not recognise His works in the Universe, He came and worked
among them as Man; in the sphere to which they had limited
themselves.](2040140.md)
