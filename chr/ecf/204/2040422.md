<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Letter XIII</span>.—*(For 341.) Coss.
Marcellinus, Probinus; Præf. Longinus; Indict. xiv; Easter-day, xiii
Kal. Maii, xxiv Pharmuthi; Æra Dioclet. 57.*

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-p2.1"></span>Again</span>, my beloved brethren, I am
ready to notify to you the saving feast <span
id="fr_4363"></span>[4364](#fn_4363.md) , which will take place according
to annual custom. For although the opponents of Christ <span
id="fr_4364"></span>[4365](#fn_4364.md) have oppressed you together with us
with afflictions and sorrows; yet, God having comforted us by our mutual
faith <span id="fr_4365"></span>[4366](#fn_4365.md) , behold, I write to
you even from Rome. Keeping the feast here with the brethren, still I
keep it with you also in will and in spirit, for we send up prayers in
common to God, ‘Who hath granted us not only to believe in Him, but also
now to suffer for His sake <span id="fr_4366"></span>[4367](#fn_4366.md) .’
For troubled as we are, because we are so far from you, He moves us to
write, that by a letter we might comfort ourselves, and provoke one
another to good <span id="fr_4367"></span>[4368](#fn_4367.md) . For,
indeed, numerous afflictions and bitter persecutions directed against
the Church have been against us. For heretics, corrupt in their mind,
untried in the faith, rising against the truth, violently persecute the
Church, and of the brethren, some are scourged and others torn with
stripes, and hardest of all, their insults reach even to the Bishops.
Nevertheless, it is not becoming, on this account, that we should
neglect the feast. But we should especially remember it, and not at all
forget its commemoration from time to time. Now the unbelievers do not
consider that there is a season for feasts, because they spend all their
lives in revelling and follies; and the feasts which they keep are an
occasion of grief rather than of joy. But to us in this present life
they are above all an uninterrupted passage \[to heaven\]—it is indeed
our season. For such things as these serve for exercise and trial, so
that, having approved ourselves zealous and chosen servants of Christ,
we may be fellow-heirs with the saints <span
id="fr_4368"></span>[4369](#fn_4368.md) . For thus Job: ‘The whole world is
a place of trial to men upon the earth <span
id="fr_4369"></span>[4370](#fn_4369.md) .’ Nevertheless, they are proved in
this world by afflictions, labours, and sorrows, to the end that each
one may receive of God such reward as is meet for him, as He saith by
the prophet, ‘I am the Lord, Who trieth the hearts, and searcheth the
reins, to give to every one according to his ways <span
id="fr_4370"></span>[4371](#fn_4370.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-p11"></span>2. Not that He first knows the
things of a man on his being proved (for He knows them all before they
come to pass), but because He is good and philanthropic, He distributes
to each a due reward according to his actions, so that every man may
exclaim, Righteous is the judgment of God! As the prophet says again,
‘The Lord trieth the just, and discerneth the reins <span
id="fr_4371"></span>[4372](#fn_4371.md) .’ Again, for this cause He tries
each one of us, either that to those who know it not, virtue may be
manifested by means of those who are proved, as was said respecting Job;
‘Thinkest thou that I was revealed to thee for any other cause, than
that thou shouldest be seen righteous <span
id="fr_4372"></span>[4373](#fn_4372.md) ?’ or that, when men come to a
sense of their deeds, they may be able to know of what manner they are,
and so may either repent of their wickedness, or abide confirmed in the
faith. Now the blessed Paul, when troubled by afflictions, and
persecutions, and hunger and thirst, ‘in everything was a conqueror,
through Jesus Christ, Who loved us <span
id="fr_4373"></span>[4374](#fn_4373.md) .’ Through suffering he was weak
indeed in body, yet, believing and hoping, he was made strong <span
id="page_540">p. 540</span> <span id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-Page_540"></span>in
spirit, and his strength was made perfect in weakness <span
id="fr_4374"></span>[4375](#fn_4374.md) .

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-p16"></span>3. The other saints also, who had a
like confidence in God, accepted a like probation with gladness, as Job
said, ‘Blessed be the name of the Lord <span
id="fr_4375"></span>[4376](#fn_4375.md) .’ But the Psalmist, ‘Search me, O
Lord, and try me: prove my reins and my heart <span
id="fr_4376"></span>[4377](#fn_4376.md) .’ For since, when the strength is
proved, it convinceth the foolish, they perceiving the cleansing and the
advantage resulting from the divine fire, were not discouraged in trials
like these, but they rather delighted in them, suffering no injury at
all from the things which happened, but being seen to shine more
brightly, like gold from the fire <span
id="fr_4377"></span>[4378](#fn_4377.md) , as he said, who was tried in such
a school of discipline as this; ‘Thou hast tried my heart, Thou hast
visited me in the night-season; Thou hast proved me, and hast not found
iniquity in me, so that my mouth shall not speak of the works of
men <span id="fr_4378"></span>[4379](#fn_4378.md) .’ But those whose
actions are not restrained by law, who know of nothing beyond eating and
drinking and dying, account trials as danger. They soon stumble at them,
so that, being untried in the faith, they are given over to a reprobate
mind, and do those things which are not seemly <span
id="fr_4379"></span>[4380](#fn_4379.md) . Therefore the blessed Paul, when
urging us to such exercises as these, and having before measured himself
by them, says, ‘Therefore I take pleasure in afflictions, in
infirmities.’ And again, ‘Exercise thyself unto godliness <span
id="fr_4380"></span>[4381](#fn_4380.md) .’ For since he knew the
persecutions that befel those who chose to live in godliness, he wished
his disciples to meditate beforehand on the difficulties connected with
godliness; that when trials should come, and affliction arise, they
might be able to bear them easily, as having been exercised in these
things. For in those things wherewith a man has been conversant in mind,
he ordinarily experiences a hidden joy. In this way, the blessed
martyrs, becoming at first conversant with difficulties, were quickly
perfected in Christ, regarding as nought the injury of the body, while
they contemplated the expected rest.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-p23"></span>4. But all those who ‘call their
lands by their own names <span id="fr_4381"></span>[4382](#fn_4381.md) ,’
and have wood, and hay, and stubble <span
id="fr_4382"></span>[4383](#fn_4382.md) in their thoughts; such as these,
since they are strangers to difficulties, become aliens from the kingdom
of heaven. Had they however known that ‘tribulation perfecteth patience,
and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not
ashamed,’ they would have exercised themselves, after the example of
Paul, who said, ‘I keep under my body and bring it into subjection, lest
when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway <span
id="fr_4383"></span>[4384](#fn_4383.md) .’ They would easily have borne the
afflictions which were brought upon them to prove them from time to
time, if the prophetic admonition <span
id="fr_4384"></span>[4385](#fn_4384.md) had been listened to by them; ‘It
is good for a man to take up Thy yoke in his youth; he shall sit alone
and shall be silent, because he hath taken Thy yoke upon him. He will
give his cheek to him who smiteth him; he will be filled with
reproaches. Because the Lord does not cast away for ever; for when He
abases, He is gracious, according to the multitude of His tender
mercies <span id="fr_4385"></span>[4386](#fn_4385.md) .’ For though all
these things should proceed from the enemies, stripes, insults,
reproaches, yet shall they avail nothing against the multitude of God’s
tender mercies; for we shall quickly recover from them since they are
merely temporal, but God is always gracious, pouring out His tender
mercies on those who please \[Him\]. Therefore, my beloved brethren, we
should not look at these temporal things, but fix our attention on those
which are eternal. Though affliction may come, it will have an end,
though insult and persecution, yet are they nothing to the hope which is
set \[before us\]. For all present matters are trifling compared with
those which are future; the sufferings of this present time not being
worthy to be compared with the hope that is to come <span
id="fr_4386"></span>[4387](#fn_4386.md) . For what can be compared with the
kingdom? or what is there in comparison with life eternal? Or what is
all we could give here, to that which we shall inherit yonder? For we
are ‘heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ <span
id="fr_4387"></span>[4388](#fn_4387.md) .’ Therefore it is not right, my
beloved, to consider afflictions and persecutions, but the hopes which
are laid up for us because of persecutions.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-p31"></span>5. Now to this the example of
Issachar, the patriarch, may persuade, as the Scripture <span
id="fr_4388"></span>[4389](#fn_4388.md) saith, ‘Issachar desires that which
is good, resting between the heritages; and when he saw that the rest
was good, and the land fertile <span
id="fr_4389"></span>[4390](#fn_4389.md) , he bowed his shoulder to labour,
and became a husbandman.’ Being consumed by divine love, like the spouse
in the Canticles, he gathered abundance from the holy Scriptures, for
his mind was captivated not by the old alone, but by both the heritages.
And hence as it were, spreading his wings, he beheld afar off ‘the rest’
which is in heaven, and,—<span id="page_541">p. 541</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-Page_541"></span>since this ‘land’ consists of such
beautiful works,—how much more truly the heavenly \[country\] must also
\[consist\] of such <span id="fr_4390"></span>[4391](#fn_4390.md) ; for the
other is ever new, and grows not old. For this ‘land’ passes away, as
the Lord said; but that which is ready to receive the saints is
immortal. Now when Issachar, the patriarch, saw these things, he
joyfully made his boast of afflictions and toils, bowing his shoulders
that he might labour. And he did not contend with those who smote him,
neither was he disturbed by insults; but like a strong man triumphing
the more by these things, and the more earnestly tilling his land, he
received profit from it. The Word scattered the seed, but he watchfully
cultivated it, so that it brought forth fruit, even a hundred-fold.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-p35"></span>6. Now what does this mean, my
beloved, but that we also, when the enemies are arrayed against us,
should glory in afflictions <span id="fr_4391"></span>[4392](#fn_4391.md) ,
and that when we are persecuted, we should not be discouraged, but
should the rather press after the crown of the high calling <span
id="fr_4392"></span>[4393](#fn_4392.md) in Christ Jesus our Lord? and that
being insulted, we should not be disturbed, but should give our cheek to
the smiter, and bow the shoulder? For the lovers of pleasure and the
lovers of enmity are tried, as saith the blessed Apostle James, ‘when
they are drawn away by their own lusts and enticed <span
id="fr_4393"></span>[4394](#fn_4393.md) .’ But let us, knowing that we
suffer for the truth, and that those who deny the Lord smite and
persecute us, ‘count it all joy, my brethren,’ according to the words of
James, ‘when we fall into trials of various temptations, knowing that
the trial of our faith worketh patience <span
id="fr_4394"></span>[4395](#fn_4394.md) .’ Let us rejoice as we keep the
feast, my brethren, knowing that our salvation is ordered in the time of
affliction. For our Saviour did not redeem us by inactivity, but by
suffering for us He abolished death. And respecting this, He intimidated
to us before, saying, ‘In the world ye shall have tribulation <span
id="fr_4395"></span>[4396](#fn_4395.md) .’ But He did not say this to every
man, but to those who diligently and faithfully perform good service to
Him, knowing beforehand, that they should be persecuted who would live
godly toward Him.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-p41"></span>7. ‘But evil-doers and sorcerers
will wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived <span
id="fr_4396"></span>[4397](#fn_4396.md) .’ If therefore, like those
expounders of dreams and false prophets who professed to give signs,
these ignorant men being drunk, not with wine, but with their own
wickedness, make a profession of priesthood, and glory in their threats,
believe them not; but since we are tried, let us humble ourselves, not
being drawn away by them. For so God warned His people by Moses, saying,
‘If there shall rise up among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and
shall give signs and tokens, and the sign or the token shall come to
pass which he spake to thee, saying, Let us go and serve strange gods,
which ye have not known; ye shall not hearken unto the words of that
prophet or that dreamer of dreams. For the Lord your God trieth you,
that He may know whether you will love the Lord your God with all your
heart <span id="fr_4397"></span>[4398](#fn_4397.md) .’ So we, when we are
tried by these things, will not separate ourselves from the love of God.
But let us now keep the feast, my beloved, not as introducing a day of
suffering, but of joy in Christ, by Whom we are fed every day. Let us be
mindful of Him Who was sacrificed in the days of the Passover; for we
celebrate this, because Christ the Passover was sacrificed <span
id="fr_4398"></span>[4399](#fn_4398.md) . He Who once brought His people
out of Egypt, and hath now abolished death, and him that had the power
of death, that is the devil <span id="fr_4399"></span>[4400](#fn_4399.md) ,
will likewise now turn him to shame, and again grant aid to those who
are troubled, and cry unto God day and night <span
id="fr_4400"></span>[4401](#fn_4400.md) .

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-p47"></span>8. We begin the fast of forty days
on the thirteenth of Phamenoth (9 Mar.), and the holy week of Easter on
the eighteenth of Pharmuthi (Apr. 13); and resting on the seventh day,
being the twenty-third (Apr. 18), and the first of the great week having
dawned on the twenty-fourth of the same month Pharmuthi (Apr. 19), let
us reckon from it till Pentecost. And at all times let us sing praises,
calling on Christ, being delivered from our enemies by Christ Jesus our
Lord, through Whom to the Father be glory and dominion for ever and
ever. Amen. Greet one another with a holy kiss. All those who are here
with me salute you. I pray, my beloved brethren, that ye may have health
in the Lord.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-p48"></span>He wrote this also from Rome. Here
endeth the thirteenth Letter.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xi-p33"></span> Jarchi interprets the passage
figuratively of Issachar being strong to bear the yoke of the law. The
Jerusalem Targum thus paraphrases the verse. ‘And he saw the rest of the
world to come, that it was good, and the portion of the land of Israel,
that it was pleasant; therefore he inclined his shoulders to work in the
law, and his brethren brought gifts unto him.
