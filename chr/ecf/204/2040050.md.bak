<span id="vi.ii.i.v-p1"></span> §5. *Evil, then consists essentially in
the choice of what is lower in preference to what is higher.*

<span id="vi.ii.i.v-p2"></span>But the audacity of men, having regard
not to what is expedient and becoming, but to what is possible for it,
began to do the contrary; whence, moving their hands to the contrary, it
made them commit murder, and led away their hearing to disobedience, and
their other members to adultery instead of to lawful procreation; and
the tongue, instead of right speaking, to slander and insult and
perjury; the hands again, to stealing and striking fellow-men; and the
sense of smell to many sorts of lascivious odours; the feet, to be swift
to shed blood, and the belly to drunkenness and insatiable
gluttony <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) . 2. All of which
things are a vice and sin of the soul: neither is there any cause of
them at all, but only the rejection of better things. For just as if a
charioteer <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) , having mounted his
chariot on the race-course, were to pay no attention to the goal, toward
which he should be driving, but, ignoring this, simply were to drive the
horse as he could, or in other words as he would, and often drive
against those he met, and often down steep places, rushing wherever he
impelled himself by the speed of the team, thinking that thus running he
has not missed the goal,—for he regards the running only, and does not
see that he has passed wide of the goal;—so the soul too, turning from
the way toward God, and driving the members of the body beyond what is
proper, or rather, driven herself along with them by her own doing, sins
and makes mischief for herself, not seeing that she has strayed from the
way, and has swerved from the goal of truth, to which the Christ-bearing
man, the blessed Paul, was looking when he said, “I press on toward the
goal unto the prize of the high calling of Christ Jesus <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) :” so that the holy man, making the
good his mark, never did what was evil.
