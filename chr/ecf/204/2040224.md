<span id="xvi.ii.xiii-p1"></span> 45. Antony, however, according to his
custom, returned alone to his own cell, increased his discipline, and
sighed daily as he thought of the mansions in Heaven, having his desire
fixed on them, and pondering over the shortness of man’s life. And he
used to eat and sleep, and go about all other bodily necessities with
shame when he thought of the spiritual faculties of the soul. So often,
when about to eat with any other hermits, recollecting the spiritual
food, he begged to be excused, and departed far off from them, deeming
it a matter for shame if he should be seen eating by others. He used,
however, when by himself, to eat through bodily necessity, but often
also with the brethren; covered with shame on these occasions, yet
speaking boldly words of help. And he used to say that it behoved a man
to give all his time to his soul rather than his body, yet to grant a
short space to the body through its necessities; but all the more
earnestly to give up the whole remainder to the soul and seek its
profit, that it might not be dragged down by the pleasures of the body,
but, on the contrary, the body might be in subjection to the soul. For
this is that which was spoken by the Saviour: ‘Be not anxious for your
life what ye shall eat, nor for your body what ye shall put on. And do
ye seek not what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, and be not of a
doubtful mind. For all these things the nations of the world seek after.
But your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. Howbeit
seek ye first His Kingdom, and all these things shall be added unto
you <span id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md) .’
