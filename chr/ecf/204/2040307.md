<span id="xix.ii.iv-p1"></span> 4. *Proceedings after the Council of
Milan.*

<span id="xix.ii.iv-p2"></span>Are they then satisfied with all this,
and content to be quiet for the future? By no means; they have not given
over yet, but like the horseleach <span
id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402.md) in the Proverbs, they revel more
and more in their wickedness, and fix themselves upon the larger
dioceses. Who can adequately describe the enormities they have already
perpetrated? who is able to recount all the deeds that they have done?
Even very lately, while the Churches were at peace, and the people
worshipping in their congregations, Liberius, Bishop of Rome,
Paulinus <span id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403.md) , Metropolitan of
Gaul, Dionysius <span id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404.md) ,
Metropolitan of Italy, Lucifer <span
id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405.md) , Metropolitan of the Sardinian
islands, and Eusebius <span id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406.md) of
Italy, all of them good Bishops and preachers of the truth, were seized
and banished <span id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407.md) , on no pretence
whatever, except that they would not unite themselves to the Arian
heresy, nor subscribe to the false accusations and calumnies which they
had invented against me.
