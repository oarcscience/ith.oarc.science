id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Texts Explained;
Eleventhly,</span> <span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p1.2"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p1.3"></span>[Mark xiii.
32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032.md)<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p1.4"></span>
and [Luke ii. 52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p1.5"></span></span> *Arian explanation of the former
text is against the Regula Fidei; and against the context. Our Lord said
He was ignorant of the Day, by reason of His human nature. If the Holy
Spirit knows the Day, therefore the Son knows; if the Son knows the
Father, therefore He knows the Day; if He has all that is the Father’s,
therefore knowledge of the Day; if in the Father, He knows the Day in
the Father; if He created and upholds all things, He knows when they
will cease to be. He knows not as Man, argued from* <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p1.6"></span>*[Matt. xxiv.
42](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#042.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p1.7"></span>. As He asked about Lazarus’s grave, &c.,
yet knew, so He knows; as S. Paul says, ‘whether in the body I know
not,’ &c., yet knew, so He knows. He said He knew not for our profit,
that we be not curious (as in* <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p1.8"></span>*[Acts i.
7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md)<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p1.9"></span>,
where on the contrary He did not say He knew not). As the Almighty asks
of Adam and of Cain, yet knew, so the Son knows\[as God\]. Again, He
advanced in wisdom also as man, else He made Angels perfect before
Himself. He advanced, in that the Godhead was manifested in Him more
fully as time went on.*

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p2"></span>42. <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p2.1"></span>These</span> things being so, come let us
now examine into ‘But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, neither
the Angels of God, nor the Son <span
id="fr_3096"></span>[3097](#fn_3096.md) ;’ for being in great ignorance as
regards these words, and being stupefied <span
id="fr_3097"></span>[3098](#fn_3097.md) about them, they think they have in
them an important argument for their heresy. But I, when the heretics
allege it and prepare themselves with it, see in them the giants <span
id="fr_3098"></span>[3099](#fn_3098.md) again fighting against God. For the
Lord of heaven and earth, by whom all things were made, has to litigate
before them about day and hour; and the Word who knows all things is
accused by them of ignorance about a day; and the Son who knows the
Father is said to be ignorant of an hour of a day; now what can be
spoken more contrary to sense, or what madness can be likened to this?
Through the Word all things have been made, times and seasons and night
and day and the whole creation; and is the Framer of all said to be
ignorant of His work? And the very context of the lection shews that the
Son of God knows that hour and that day, though the Arians fall headlong
in their ignorance. For after saying, ‘nor the Son,’ He relates to the
disciples what precedes the day, saying, ‘This and that shall be, and
then the end.’ But He who speaks of what precedes the day, knows
certainly the day also, which shall be manifested subsequently to the
things foretold. But if He had not known the hour, He had not signified
the events before it, as not knowing when it should be. And as any one,
who, by way of pointing out a house or city to those who were ignorant
of it, gave an <span id="page_417">p. 417</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-Page_417"></span>account of what comes before the house
or city, and having described all, said, ‘Then immediately comes the
city or the house,’ would know of course where the house or the city was
(for had he not known, he had not described what comes before lest from
ignorance he should throw his hearers far out of the way, or in speaking
he should unawares go beyond the object), so the Lord saying what
precedes that day and that hour, knows exactly, nor is ignorant, when
the hour and the day are at hand.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p6"></span>43. Now why it was that, though He
knew, He did not tell His disciples plainly at that time, no one may be
curious <span id="fr_3099"></span>[3100](#fn_3099.md) where He has been
silent; for ‘Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His
counsellor <span id="fr_3100"></span>[3101](#fn_3100.md) ?’ but why, though
He knew, He said, ‘no, not the Son knows,’ this I think none of the
faithful is ignorant, viz. that He made this as those other declarations
as man by reason of the flesh. For this as before is not the Word’s
deficiency <span id="fr_3101"></span>[3102](#fn_3101.md) , but of that
human nature <span id="fr_3102"></span>[3103](#fn_3102.md) whose property
it is to be ignorant. And this again will be well seen by honestly
examining into the occasion, when and to whom the Saviour spoke thus.
Not then when the heaven was made by Him, nor when He was with the
Father Himself, the Word ‘disposing all things <span
id="fr_3103"></span>[3104](#fn_3103.md) ,’ nor before He became man did He
say it, but when ‘the Word became flesh <span
id="fr_3104"></span>[3105](#fn_3104.md) .’ On this account it is reasonable
to ascribe to His manhood everything which, after He became man, He
speaks humanly. For it is proper to the Word to know what was made, nor
be ignorant either of the beginning or of the end of these (for the
works are His), and He knows how many things He wrought, and the limit
of their consistence. And knowing of each the beginning and the end, He
knows surely the general and common end of all. Certainly when He says
in the Gospel concerning Himself in His human character, ‘Father, the
hour is come, glorify Thy Son <span id="fr_3105"></span>[3106](#fn_3105.md)
,’ it is plain that He knows also the hour of the end of all things, as
the Word, though as man He is ignorant of it, for ignorance is proper to
man <span id="fr_3106"></span>[3107](#fn_3106.md) , and especially
ignorance of these things. Moreover this is proper to the Saviour’s love
of man; for since He was made man, He is not ashamed, because of the
flesh which is ignorant <span id="fr_3107"></span>[3108](#fn_3107.md) , to
say ‘I know not,’ that He may shew that knowing as God, He is but
ignorant according to the flesh <span
id="fr_3108"></span>[3109](#fn_3108.md) . And therefore He said not, ‘no,
not the Son of God knows,’ lest the Godhead should seem ignorant, but
simply, ‘no, not the Son,’ that the ignorance might be the Son’s as born
from among men.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p17"></span>44. On this account, He alludes to
the Angels, but He did not go further and say, ‘not the Holy Ghost;’ but
He was silent, with a double intimation; first that if the Spirit knew,
much more must the Word know, considered as the Word, from whom the
Spirit receives <span id="fr_3109"></span>[3110](#fn_3109.md) ; and next by
His silence about the Spirit, He made it clear, that He said of His
human ministry, ‘no, not the Son.’ And a proof of it is this; that, when
He had spoken humanly <span id="fr_3110"></span>[3111](#fn_3110.md) ‘No,
not the Son knows,’ <span id="page_418">p. 418</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-Page_418"></span>He yet shews that divinely He knew all
things. For that Son whom He declares not to know the day, Him He
declares to know the Father; for ‘No one,’ He says, ‘knoweth the Father
save the Son <span id="fr_3111"></span>[3112](#fn_3111.md) .’ And all men
but the Arians would join in confessing, that He who knows the Father,
much more knows the whole of the creation; and in that whole, its end.
And if already the day and the hour be determined by the Father, it is
plain that through the Son are they determined, and He knows Himself
what through Him has been determined <span
id="fr_3112"></span>[3113](#fn_3112.md) , for there is nothing but has come
to be and has been determined through the Son. Therefore He, being the
Framer of the universe, knows of what nature, and of what magnitude, and
with what limits, the Father has willed it to be made; and in the how
much and how far is included its period. And again, if all that is the
Father’s, is the Son’s (and this He Himself has <span
id="fr_3113"></span>[3114](#fn_3113) said.md), and it is the Father’s
attribute to know the day, it is plain that the Son too knows it, having
this proper to Him from the Father. And again, if the Son be in the
Father and the Father in the Son, and the Father knows the day and the
hour, it is clear that the Son, being in the Father and knowing the
things of the Father, knows Himself also the day and the hour. And if
the Son is also the Father’s Very Image, and the Father knows the day
and the hour, it is plain that the Son has this likeness <span
id="fr_3114"></span>[3115](#fn_3114.md) also to the Father of knowing them.
And it is not wonderful if He, through whom all things were made, and in
whom the universe consists, Himself knows what has been brought to be,
and when the end will be of each and of all together; rather is it
wonderful that this audacity, suitable as it is to the madness of the
Ario-maniacs, should have forced us to have recourse to so long a
defence. For ranking the Son of God, the Eternal Word, among things
originate, they are not far from venturing to maintain that the Father
Himself is second to the creation; for if He who knows the Father knows
not the day nor the hour, I fear lest the knowledge of the creation, or
rather of the lower portion of it, be greater, as they in their madness
would say, than knowledge concerning the Father.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p24"></span>45. But for them, when they thus
blaspheme the Spirit, they must expect no remission ever of such
irreligion, as the Lord has said <span
id="fr_3115"></span>[3116](#fn_3115.md) ; but let us, who love Christ and
bear Christ within us, know that the Word, not as ignorant, considered
as Word, has said ‘I know not,’ for He knows, but as shewing His
manhood <span id="fr_3116"></span>[3117](#fn_3116.md) , in that to be
ignorant is proper to man, and that He had put on flesh that was
ignorant <span id="fr_3117"></span>[3118](#fn_3117.md) , being in which, He
said according to the flesh, ‘I know not.’ And for this reason, after
saying, ‘No not the Son knows,’ and mentioning the ignorance of the men
in Noah’s day, immediately He added, ‘Watch therefore, for ye know not
in what hour your Lord doth come,’ and again, ‘In such an hour as ye
think not, the Son of man cometh <span
id="fr_3118"></span>[3119](#fn_3118.md) .’ For I too, having become as you
for you, said ‘no, not the Son.’ For, had He been ignorant divinely, He
must have said, ‘Watch therefore, for I know not,’ and, ‘In an hour when
I think not;’ but in fact this hath He not said; but by saying ‘Ye know
not’ and ‘When ye think not,’ He has signified that it belongs to man to
be ignorant; for whose sake He too having a flesh like theirs and having
become man, said ‘No, not the Son knows,’ for He knew not in flesh,
though knowing as Word. And again the <span id="page_419">p. 419</span>
<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-Page_419"></span>example from Noah exposes the
shamelessness of Christ’s enemies; for there too He said not, ‘I knew
not,’ but ‘They knew not until the flood came <span
id="fr_3119"></span>[3120](#fn_3119.md) .’ For men did not know, but He who
brought the flood (and it was the Saviour Himself) knew the day and the
hour in which He opened the cataracts of heaven and broke up the great
deep, and said to Noah, ‘Come thou and all thy house into the ark <span
id="fr_3120"></span>[3121](#fn_3120.md) .’ For were He ignorant, He had not
foretold to Noah, ‘Yet seven days and I will bring a flood upon the
earth.’ But if in describing the day He makes use of the parallel of
Noah’s time, and He did know the day of the flood, therefore He knows
also the day of His own coming.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p31"></span>46. Moreover, after narrating the
parable of the Virgins, again He shews more clearly who they are who are
ignorant of the day and the hour, saying, ‘Watch therefore, for ye know
neither the day nor the hour <span id="fr_3121"></span>[3122](#fn_3121.md)
.’ He who said shortly before, ‘No one knoweth, no not the Son,’ now
says not ‘I know not,’ but ‘ye know not.’ In like manner then, when His
disciples asked about the end, suitably said He then, ‘no, nor the Son,’
according to the flesh because of the body; that He might shew that, as
man, He knows not; for ignorance is proper to man <span
id="fr_3122"></span>[3123](#fn_3122.md) . If however He is the Word, if it
is He who is to come, He to be Judge, He to be the Bridegroom, He
knoweth when and in what hour He cometh, and when He is to say, ‘Awake,
thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
light <span id="fr_3123"></span>[3124](#fn_3123.md) .’ For as, on becoming
man, He hungers and thirsts and suffers with men, so with men as man He
knows not; though divinely, being in the Father Word and Wisdom, He
knows, and there is nothing which He knows not. In like manner also
about Lazarus <span id="fr_3124"></span>[3125](#fn_3124.md) He asks
humanly, who was on His way to raise him, and knew whence He should
recall Lazarus’s soul; and it was a greater thing to know where the soul
was, than to know where the body lay; but He asked humanly, that He
might raise divinely. So too He asks of the disciples, on coming into
the parts of Cæsarea, though knowing even before Peter made answer. For
if the Father revealed to Peter the answer to the Lord’s question, it is
plain that through the Son <span id="fr_3125"></span>[3126](#fn_3125.md)
was the revelation, for ‘No one knoweth the Son,’ saith He, ‘save the
Father, neither the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son
will reveal Him <span id="fr_3126"></span>[3127](#fn_3126.md) .’ But if
through the Son is revealed the knowledge both of the Father and the
Son, there is no room for doubting that the Lord who asked, having first
revealed it to Peter from the Father, next asked humanly; in order to
shew, that asking after the flesh, He knew divinely what Peter was about
to say. The Son then knew, as knowing all things, and knowing His own
Father, than which knowledge nothing can be greater or more perfect.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p38"></span>47. This is sufficient to confute
them; but to shew still further that they are hostile to the truth and
Christ’s enemies, I could wish to ask them a question. The Apostle in
the Second Epistle to the Corinthians writes, ‘I knew a man in Christ,
above fourteen years ago, whether in the body I do not know, or whether
out of the body I do not know; God knoweth <span
id="fr_3127"></span>[3128](#fn_3127.md) .’ What now say ye? Knew the
Apostle what had happened to him in the vision, though he says ‘I know
not,’ or knew he not? If he knew not, see to it, lest, being familiar
with error, ye err in the trespass <span
id="fr_3128"></span>[3129](#fn_3128.md) of the Phrygians <span
id="fr_3129"></span>[3130](#fn_3129.md) , who say that the Prophets and the
other ministers of the Word know neither what they do nor concerning
what they announce. But if he knew when he said ‘I know not,’ for he had
Christ within him revealing to him all things, is not the heart of God’s
enemies indeed perverted and ‘self-condemned?’ for when the Apostle
says, ‘I know not,’ they say that he knows; but when the Lord says, ‘I
know not,’ they say that He does not know. For if since Christ was
within him, Paul knew that of which he says, ‘I know not,’ does not much
more Christ Himself know, though He say, ‘I know not?’ The Apostle then,
the Lord revealing it to him, knew what happened to him; for on this
account he says, ‘I knew a man in Christ;’ and knowing the man, he knew
also how the man was caught away. Thus Elisha, who beheld Elijah, knew
<span id="page_420">p. 420</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-Page_420"></span>also how he was taken up; but though
knowing, yet when the sons of the Prophets thought that Elijah was cast
upon one of the mountains by the Spirit, he knowing from the first what
he had seen, tried to persuade them; but when they urged it, he was
silent, and suffered them to go after him. Did he then not know, because
he was silent? he knew indeed, but as if not knowing, he suffered them,
that they being convinced, might no more doubt about the taking up of
Elijah. Therefore much more Paul, himself being the person caught away,
knew also how he was caught; for Elijah knew; and had any one asked, he
would have said how. And yet Paul says ‘I know not,’ for these two
reasons, as I think at least; one, as he has said himself, lest because
of the abundance of the revelations any one should think of him beyond
what he saw; the other, because, our Saviour having said ‘I know not,’
it became him also to say ‘I know not,’ lest the servant should appear
above his Lord, and the disciple above his Master.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p42"></span>48. Therefore He who gave to Paul to
know, much rather knew Himself; for since He spoke of the antecedents of
the day, He also knew, as I said before, when the Day and when the Hour,
and yet though knowing, He says, ‘No, not the Son knoweth.’ Why then
said He at that time ‘I know not,’ what He as Lord <span
id="fr_3130"></span>[3131](#fn_3130.md) , knew? as we may by searching
conjecture, for our profit <span id="fr_3131"></span>[3132](#fn_3131.md) ,
as I think at least, did He this; and may He grant to what we are now
proposing a true meaning! On both sides did the Saviour secure our
advantage; for He has made known what comes before the end, that, as He
said Himself, we might not be startled nor scared, when they happen, but
from them may expect the end after them. And concerning the day and the
hour He was not willing to say according to His divine nature, ‘I know,’
but after the flesh, ‘I know not,’ for the sake of the flesh which was
ignorant <span id="fr_3132"></span>[3133](#fn_3132.md) , as I have said
before; lest they should ask Him further, and then either He should have
to pain the disciples by not speaking, or by speaking might act to the
prejudice of them and us all. For whatever He does, that altogether He
does for our sakes, since also for us ‘the Word became flesh.’ For us
therefore He said ‘No, not the Son knoweth;’ and neither was He untrue
in thus saying (for He said humanly, as man, ‘I know not’), nor did He
suffer the disciples to force Him to speak, for by saying ‘I know not’
He stopped their inquiries. And so in the Acts of the Apostles it is
written, when He went upon the Angels, ascending as man, and carrying up
to heaven the flesh which He bore, on the disciples seeing this, and
again asking, ‘When shall the end be, and when wilt Thou be present?’ He
said to them more clearly, ‘It is not for you to know the times or the
seasons which the Father hath put in His own power <span
id="fr_3133"></span>[3134](#fn_3133.md) .’ And He did not then say, ‘No,
not the Son,’ as He said before humanly, but, ‘It is not for you to
know.’ For now the flesh had risen and put off its mortality and been
deified; and no longer did it become Him to answer after the flesh when
He was going into the heavens; but henceforth to teach after a divine
manner, ‘It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father
hath put in His own power; but ye shall receive Power <span
id="fr_3134"></span>[3135](#fn_3134.md) .’ And what is that Power of the
Father but the Son? for Christ is ‘God’s Power and God’s Wisdom.’

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p48"></span>49. The Son then did know, as being
the Word; for He implied this in what He said,—‘I know but it is not for
you to know;’ for it was for your sakes that sitting also on the mount I
said according to the flesh, ‘No, not the Son knoweth,’ for the profit
of you and all. For it is profitable to you to hear so much both of the
Angels and of the Son, because of the deceivers which shall be
afterwards; that though demons should be transfigured as Angels, and
should attempt to speak concerning the end, you should not believe,
since they are ignorant; and that, if Antichrist too, disguising
himself, should say, ‘I am Christ,’ and should try in his turn to speak
of that day and end, to deceive the hearers, ye, having these words from
Me, ‘No, not the Son,’ may disbelieve him also. And further, not to know
when the end is, or when the day of the end, is expedient for man, lest
knowing, they might become negligent of the time between, awaiting the
days near the end; for they will argue that then only must they attend
to themselves <span id="fr_3135"></span>[3136](#fn_3135.md) . Therefore
also has He been silent of the time when each shall die, lest men, being
elated on the ground of knowledge, should forthwith neglect themselves
for the greater part of their time. Both then, the end of all things and
the limit of each of us hath the Word concealed from us (for in the end
of all is the end of each, and in the end of each the end of all is
comprehended), that, whereas it is uncertain and <span id="page_421">p.
421</span> <span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-Page_421"></span>always in prospect,
we may advance day by day as if summoned, reaching forward to the things
before us and forgetting the things behind <span
id="fr_3136"></span>[3137](#fn_3136.md) . For who, knowing the day of the
end, would not be dilatory with the interval? but, if ignorant, would
not be ready day by day? It was on this account that the Saviour added,
‘Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come;’ and,
‘In such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh <span
id="fr_3137"></span>[3138](#fn_3137.md) .’ For the advantage then which
comes of ignorance has He said this; for in saying it, He wishes that we
should always be prepared; ‘for you,’ He says, ‘know not; but I, the
Lord, know when I come, though the Arians do not wait for Me, who am the
Word of the Father.’

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p52"></span>50. The Lord then, knowing what is
good for us beyond ourselves, thus secured the disciples; and they,
being thus taught, set right those of Thessalonica <span
id="fr_3138"></span>[3139](#fn_3138.md) when likely on this point to run
into error. However, since Christ’s enemies do not yield even to these
considerations, I wish, though knowing that they have a heart harder
than Pharaoh, to ask them again concerning this. In Paradise God asks,
‘Adam, where art Thou <span id="fr_3139"></span>[3140](#fn_3139.md) ’ and
He inquires of Cain also, ‘Where is Abel thy brother <span
id="fr_3140"></span>[3141](#fn_3140.md) ?’ What then say you to this? for
if you think Him ignorant and therefore to have asked, you are already
of the party of the Manichees, for this is their bold thought; but if,
fearing the open name, ye force yourselves to say, that He asks knowing,
what is there extravagant or strange in the doctrine, that ye should
thus fall, on finding that the Son, in whom God then inquired, that same
Son who now is clad in flesh, inquires of the disciples as man? unless
forsooth, having become Manichees, you are willing to blame <span
id="fr_3141"></span>[3142](#fn_3141.md) the question then put to Adam and
all that you may give full play <span
id="fr_3142"></span>[3143](#fn_3142.md) to your perverseness. For being
exposed on all sides, you still make a whispering <span
id="fr_3143"></span>[3144](#fn_3143.md) from the words of Luke, which are
rightly said, but ill understood by you. And what this is, we must
state, that so also their corrupt <span
id="fr_3144"></span>[3145](#fn_3144.md) meaning may be shewn.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p60"></span>51. Now Luke says, ‘And Jesus
advanced in wisdom and stature, and in grace with God and man <span
id="fr_3145"></span>[3146](#fn_3145.md) .’ This then is the passage, and
since they stumble in it, we are compelled to ask them, like the
Pharisees and the Sadducees, of the person concerning whom Luke speaks.
And the case stands thus. Is Jesus Christ man, as all other men, or is
He God bearing flesh? If then He is an ordinary <span
id="fr_3146"></span>[3147](#fn_3146.md) man as the rest, then let Him, as a
man, advance; this however is the sentiment of the Samosatene, which
virtually indeed you entertain also, though in name you deny it because
of men. But if He be God bearing flesh, as He truly is, and ‘the Word
became flesh,’ and being God descended upon earth, what advance had He
who existed equal to God? or how had the Son increase, being ever in the
Father? For if He who was ever in the Father, advanced, what, I ask, is
there beyond the Father from which His advance might be made? Next it is
suitable here to repeat what was said upon the point of His receiving
and being glorified. If He advanced <span
id="fr_3147"></span>[3148](#fn_3147.md) when He became man, it is plain
that, before He became man, He was imperfect; and rather the flesh
became to Him a cause of perfection, than He to the flesh. And again,
if, as being the Word, He advances, what has He more to become than Word
and Wisdom and Son and God’s Power? For the Word is all these, of which
if one can anyhow partake as it were one ray, such a man becomes all
perfect among men, and equal to Angels. For Angels, and Archangels, and
Dominions, and all the Powers, and Thrones, as partaking the Word,
behold always the face of His Father. How then does He who to others
supplies perfection, Himself advance later than they? For Angels even
ministered to His human birth, and the passage from Luke comes later
than the ministration of the Angels. How then at all can it even come
into thought of man? or how did Wisdom advance in wisdom? or how did He
who to others gives grace (as Paul says in every Epistle, knowing that
through Him grace is given, ‘The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
you all’), how did He advance in grace? for either let them say that the
Apostle is untrue, and presume to say that the Son is not Wisdom, or
else if He is Wisdom as Solomon said, and if Paul wrote, ‘Christ God’s
Power and God’s Wisdom,’ of what advance did Wisdom admit further?

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p64"></span>52. For men, creatures as they are,
are <span id="page_422">p. 422</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-Page_422"></span>capable in a certain way of reaching
forward and advancing in virtue <span
id="fr_3148"></span>[3149](#fn_3148.md) . Enoch, for instance, was thus
translated, and Moses increased and was perfected; and Isaac ‘by
advancing became great <span id="fr_3149"></span>[3150](#fn_3149.md) ;’ and
the Apostle said that he ‘reached forth <span
id="fr_3150"></span>[3151](#fn_3150.md) ’ day by day to what was before
him. For each had room for advancing, looking to the step before him.
But the Son of God, who is One and Only, what room had He for reaching
forward? for all things advance by looking at Him; and He, being One and
Only, is in the Only Father, from whom again He does not reach forward,
but in Him abideth ever <span id="fr_3151"></span>[3152](#fn_3151.md) . To
men then belongs advance; but the Son of God, since He could not
advance, being perfect in the Father, humbled Himself for us, that in
His humbling we on the other hand might be able to increase. And our
increase is no other than the renouncing things sensible, and coming to
the Word Himself; since His humbling is nothing else than His taking our
flesh. It was not then the Word, considered as the Word, who advanced;
who is perfect from the perfect Father <span
id="fr_3152"></span>[3153](#fn_3152.md) , who needs nothing, nay brings
forward others to an advance; but humanly is He here also said to
advance, since advance belongs to man <span
id="fr_3153"></span>[3154](#fn_3153.md) . Hence the Evangelist, speaking
with cautious exactness <span id="fr_3154"></span>[3155](#fn_3154.md) , has
mentioned stature in the advance; but being Word and God He is not
measured by stature, which belongs to bodies. Of the body then is the
advance; for, it advancing, in it advanced also the manifestation <span
id="fr_3155"></span>[3156](#fn_3155.md) of the Godhead to those who saw it.
And, as the Godhead was more and more revealed, by so much more did His
grace as man increase before all men. For as a child He was carried to
the Temple; and when He became a boy, He remained there, and questioned
the priests about the Law. And by degrees His body increasing, and the
Word manifesting Himself <span id="fr_3156"></span>[3157](#fn_3156.md) in
it, He is confessed henceforth by Peter first, then also by all, ‘Truly
this is the Son of God <span id="fr_3157"></span>[3158](#fn_3157.md) ;’
however wilfully the Jews, both the ancient and these modern <span
id="fr_3158"></span>[3159](#fn_3158.md) , shut fast their eyes, lest they
see that to advance in wisdom is not the advance of Wisdom Itself, but
rather the manhood’s advance in It. For ‘Jesus advanced in wisdom and
grace;’ and, if we may speak what is explanatory as well as true, He
advanced in Himself; for ‘Wisdom builded herself an house,’ and in
herself she gave the house advancement.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p76"></span>53. (What moreover is this advance
that is spoken of, but, as I said before, the deifying and grace
imparted from Wisdom to men, sin being obliterated in them and their
inward corruption, according to their likeness and relationship to the
flesh of the Word?) For thus, the body increasing in stature, there
developed in it the manifestation of the Godhead also, and to all was it
displayed that the body was God’s Temple <span
id="fr_3159"></span>[3160](#fn_3159.md) , and that God was in the body. And
if they urge, that ‘The Word become flesh’ is called Jesus, and refer to
Him the term ‘advanced,’ they must be told that neither does this
impair <span id="fr_3160"></span>[3161](#fn_3160.md) the Father’s
Light <span id="fr_3161"></span>[3162](#fn_3161.md) , which is the Son, but
that it still shews that the Word has become man, and bore true flesh.
And as we said <span id="fr_3162"></span>[3163](#fn_3162.md) that He
suffered in the flesh, and hungered in the flesh, and was fatigued in
the flesh, so also reasonably may He be said to have advanced in the
flesh; for neither did the advance, such as we have described it, take
place with the Word external to the flesh, for in Him was the flesh
which advanced and His is it called, and that as before, that man’s
advance might abide <span id="fr_3163"></span>[3164](#fn_3163.md) and fail
not, because of the Word which is with it. Neither then was the advance
the Word’s, nor was the flesh Wisdom, but the flesh became the body of
Wisdom <span id="fr_3164"></span>[3165](#fn_3164.md) . Therefore, as we
have already said, not Wisdom, as Wisdom, advanced in respect of Itself;
but the manhood advanced in Wisdom, transcending by degrees human
nature, and being deified, and becoming and appearing to all as the
organ <span id="fr_3165"></span>[3166](#fn_3165.md) of Wisdom for the
operation and the shining forth <span
id="fr_3166"></span>[3167](#fn_3166.md) of the Godhead. Wherefore neither
said he, ‘The Word advanced,’ but Jesus, by which Name the Lord was
called when He became man; so that the advance is of the human nature in
such wise as we explained above.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p14"></span> Though our Lord, as having two
natures, had a human as well as a divine knowledge, and though that
human knowledge was not only limited because human, but liable to
ignorance in matters in which greater knowledge was possible; yet it is
the doctrine of the \[later\] Church, that *in fact* He was not ignorant
even in His human nature, according to its capacity, since it was from
the first taken out of its original and natural condition, and ‘deified’
by its union with the Word. As then (*supr.* ii. 45, note 1) His manhood
was created, yet He may not be called a creature even in His manhood,
and as (*supr.* ii. 14, note 5) His flesh was in its abstract nature a
servant, yet He is not a servant in fact, even as regards the flesh; so,
though He took on Him a soul which left to itself had been partially
ignorant, as other human souls, yet as ever enjoying the beatific vision
from its oneness with the Word, it never was ignorant really, but knew
all things which human soul can know. vid. Eulog. *ap. Phot.* 230. p.
884. As Pope Gregory expresses it, ‘Novit in natura, non ex natura
humanitatis.’ *Epp.* x. 39. However, this view of the sacred subject was
received by the Church only after S. Athanasius’s day, and it cannot be
denied that others of the most eminent Fathers seem to impute ignorance
to our Lord as man, as Athan. in this passage. Of course it is not meant
that our Lord’s soul has the same perfect knowledge as He has as God.
This was the assertion of a General of the Hermits of S. Austin at the
time of the Council of Basel, when the proposition was formally
condemned, animam Christi Deum videre tam clare et intense quam clare et
intense Deus videt seipsum. vid. Berti *Opp.* t. 3. p. 42. Yet
Fulgentius had said, ‘I think that in no respect was full knowledge of
the Godhead wanting to that Soul, whose Person is one with the Word:
whom Wisdom so assumed that it is itself that same Wisdom.’ *ad
Ferrand.* iii. p. 223. ed. 1639. Yet, *ad Trasmund.* i. 7. he speaks of
ignorance attaching to our Lord’s human nature.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p16"></span> And so Athan. *ad Serap.* ii. 9. S.
Basil on the question being asked him by S. Amphilochius, says that he
shall give him the answer he had ‘heard from a boy from the fathers,’
but which was more fitted for pious Christians than for cavillers, and
that is, that ‘our Lord says many things to men in His human aspect; as
“Give me to drink,”…yet He who asked was not flesh without a soul, but
Godhead using flesh which had one.’ *Ep.* 236, 1. He goes on to suggest
another explanation which has been mentioned §42, note 1. Cf. Cyril
*Trin.* pp. 623, 4. vid. also *Thes.* p. 220. ‘As he submitted as man to
hunger and thirst, so.…to be ignorant.” p. 221. vid. also Greg. Naz.
*Orat.* 30, 15. Theodoret expresses the same opinion very strongly,
speaking of a gradual revelation to the manhood from the Godhead, but in
an argument where it was to his point to do so; in *Anath.* 4. t. v. p.
23. ed. Schulze. Theodore of Mopsuestia also speaks of a revelation made
by the Word. ap. Leont. *c. Nest* (Canis. i. p. 579.)

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p19"></span> Leporius, in his Retractation, which
S. Augustine subscribed, writes, ‘That I may in this respect also leave
nothing to be cause of suspicion to any one, I then said, nay I answered
when it was put to me, that our Lord Jesus Christ was ignorant as He was
man, (secundum hominem). But now not only do I not presume to say so,
but I even anathematize my former opinion expressed on this point,’ *ap.
Sirm.* t. i. p. 210. A subdivision also of the Eutychians were called by
the name of Agnoetæ from their holding that our Lord was ignorant of the
day of judgment. ‘They said,’ says Leontius, ‘that He was ignorant of
it, as we say that He underwent toil.’ *de Sect.* 5. circ. fin. Felix of
Urgela held the same doctrine according to Agobard’s testimony, see §46,
n. 2. Montfaucon observes on the text, that the assertion of our Lord’s
ignorance ‘seems to have been condemned in no one in ancient times,
unless joined to other error.’ And Petavius, after drawing out the
authorities for and against it, says, ‘Of these two opinions, the
latter, which is now received both by custom and by the agreement of
divines, is deservedly preferred to the former. For it is more agreeable
to Christ’s dignity, and more befitting His character and office of
Mediator and Head, that is, Fountain of all grace and wisdom, and
moreover of Judge, who is concerned in knowing the time fixed for
exercising that function. In consequence, the former opinion, though
formerly it received the countenance of some men of high eminence, was
afterwards marked as a heresy.’ *Incarn.* xi. 1. §15.

id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p25.2"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p26"></span> It is a question to be decided,
whether our Lord speaks of actual ignorance in His human Mind, or of the
natural ignorance of that Mind considered as human; ignorance *in* or
*ex* natura; or, which comes to the same thing, whether He spoke of a
real ignorance, or of an economical or professed ignorance, in a certain
view of His incarnation or office, as when He asked, ‘How many loaves
have ye?’ when ‘He Himself knew what He would do,’ or as He is called
sin, though sinless. Thus it has been noticed, *supr.* ii. 55, n. 7,
that Ath. seems to make His infirmities altogether only imputative, not
real, as if shewing that the subject had not in his day been thoroughly
worked out. In like manner S. Hilary, who, if the passage be genuine,
states so clearly our Lord’s ignorance, *de Trin.* ix. fin. yet, as
Petavius observes, seems elsewhere to deny to Him those very affections
of the flesh to which he has there paralleled it. And this view of
Athan.’s meaning is favoured by the turn of his expressions. He says
such a defect belongs to ‘*that human nature* whose property it is to be
ignorant;’ §43. that ‘since He was made man, He is not *ashamed,*
because of the flesh which is ignorant, *to say,* “I know not;”’ ibid.
and, as here, that ‘as *shewing* His manhood, in that to be ignorant is
*proper* to man, and that He had *put on* a flesh *that was ignorant,*
being in which, He *said* according to the flesh, “I know not;”’ ‘that
He might *shew* that as man He knows not;’ §46. that ‘*as* man’ (i.e. on
the *ground* of being man, not in the *capacity* of man), ‘He knows
not;’ ibid. and that, ‘He *asks* about Lazarus humanly,’ even when ‘He
was *on His way* to raise him,’ which implied surely knowledge in His
human nature. The reference to the parallel of S. Paul’s professed
ignorance when he really knew, §47. leads us to the same suspicion. And
so ‘for *our profit* as I think, did He this.’ §§48–50. The natural want
of precision on such questions in the early ages was shewn or fostered
by such words as <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p26.2"></span>οἰκονομικῶς</span>, which, in respect of
this very text, is used by S. Basil to denote both our Lord’s
Incarnation, *Ep.* 236, 1 fin. and His gracious accommodation of Himself
and His truth, *Ep.* 8, 6. and with the like variety of meaning, with
reference to the same text, by Cyril. *Trin.* p. 623. and *Thesaur.* p.
224. (And the word *dispensatio* in like manner, Ben. note on *Hil.* x.
8.) In the latter *Ep.* S. Basil suggests that our Lord ‘economizes by a
feigned ignorance.’ §6. And S. Cyril. *Thesaur.* p. 224. And even in *de
Trin.* vi. he seems to recognise the distinction laid down just now
between the natural and actual state of our Lord’s humanity; and so
Hilary, *Trin.* ix. 62. And he gives reasons why He professed ignorance,
n. 67. viz. as S. Austin words it, Christum se dixisse nescientem, in
quo alios facit occultando nescientes. *Ep.* 180, 3. S. Austin follows
him, saying, Hoc nescit quod nescienter facit. *Trin.* i. 23. Pope
Gregory says that the text ‘is most certainly to be referred to the Son
not as He is Head, but as to His body which we are.’ *Ep* x. 39. And S.
Ambrose *de fid.* v. 222. And so Cæsarius, Qu. 20. and Photius *Epp.* p.
366. Chrysost. in Matt. *Hom.* 77, 3. Theodoret, however, but in
controversy, is very severe on the principle of Economy. ‘If He knew the
day, and wishing to conceal it, said He was ignorant, see what a
blasphemy is the result. Truth tells an untruth.’ l. c, pp. 23, 4.

ignorant of the day of judgment; and was *truly* ignorant what the two
disciples were saying, as they walked by the way, of what had been done
at Jerusalem; and was *truly* ignorant whether He was more loved by

‘Whatever the prophets have said, they spoke with understanding,

i.e. they were the first heretics who professed to prophesy and to
introduce a new or additional revelation.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p65"></span> It is the doctrine of the \[medieval
and modern\] Church that Christ, as man, was perfect in knowledge from
the first, as if ignorance were hardly separable from sin, and were the
direct consequence or accompaniment of original sin. Cf. Aug. *de Pecc.
Mer.* ii. 48. As to the limits of Christ’s perfect knowledge as man,
Petavius observes, that we must consider ‘that the soul of Christ knew
all things that are or ever will be or ever have been, but not what are
only *in posse*, not in fact.’ *Incarn.* xi. 3, 6.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.vi-p73"></span> It is remarkable, considering the
tone of his statements in the present chapter, that here and in what
follows Athan. should resolve our Lord’s advance in wisdom merely to its
gradual manifestation through the flesh \[but he says expressly ‘the
Manhood advanced in wisdom!’\] and it increases the proof that his
statements are not to be taken in the letter, and as if fully brought
out and settled. Naz. says the same, *Ep. ad Cled.* 101. p. 86. which is
the more remarkable since he is chiefly writing against the
Apollinarians, who considered a <span class="Greek"><span

Lord’s coming; and Cyril. *c. Nest.* iii. p. 87. Theod. *Hor.* v. 13. On
