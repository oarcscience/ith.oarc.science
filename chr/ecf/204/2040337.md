<span id="xx.ii.iv"></span>

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c8"><span
id="xx.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Part IV.</span>

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p2"></span><span class="c40"><span
id="xx.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>Second Arian Persecution under
Constantius</span>

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p3"></span>28. But the inheritors of the opinions and
impiety of Eusebius and his fellows, the eunuch Leontius <span
id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md) , who ought not to remain in
communion even as a layman <span id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md) ,
because he mutilated himself that he might henceforward be at liberty to
sleep with one Eustolium, who is a wife as far as he is concerned, but
is called a virgin; and George and Acacius, and Theodorus, and
Narcissus, who are deposed by the Council; when they heard and saw these
things, were greatly ashamed. And when they perceived the unanimity and
peace that existed between Athanasius and the Bishops (they were more
than four hundred <span id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600.md) , from
great Rome, and all Italy, from Calabria, Apulia, Campania, Bruttia,
Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and the whole of Africa; and those from Gaul,
Britain, and Spain, with the great Confessor Hosius; and also those from
Pannonia, Noricum, Siscia, Dalmatia, Dardania, Dacia, Mœsia, Macedonia,
Thessaly, and all Achaia, and from Crete, Cyprus, and Lycia, with most
of those from Palestine, Isauria, Egypt, the Thebais, the whole of
Libya, and Pentapolis); when I say they perceived these things, they
were possessed with envy and fear; with envy, on account of the
communion of so many together; and with fear, lest those who had been
entrapped by them should be brought over by the unanimity of so great a
number, and henceforth their heresy should be triumphantly exposed, and
everywhere proscribed.

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p7"></span>29. *Relapse of Ursacius and Valens.*

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p8"></span>First of all they persuade Ursacius,
Valens and their fellows to change sides again, and like dogs <span
id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md) to return to their own vomit, and
like swine to wallow again in the former mire of their impiety; and they
make this excuse for their retractation, that they did it through fear
of the most religious Constans. And yet even had there been cause for
fear, yet if they had confidence in what they had done, they ought not
to have become traitors to their friends. But when there was no cause
for fear, and yet they were guilty of a lie, are they not deserving of
utter condemnation? For no soldier was present, no Palatine or
Notary <span id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md) had been sent, as they
now send them, nor yet was the Emperor there, nor had they been invited
by any one, when they wrote their recantation. But they voluntarily went
up to Rome, and of their own accord recanted and wrote it down in the
Church, where there was no fear from without, where the only fear is the
fear of God, and where every one has liberty of conscience. And yet
although they have a second time become Arians, and then have devised
this unseemly excuse for their conduct, they are still without shame.

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p11"></span>30. *Constantius changes sides again.*

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p12"></span>In the next place they went in a body to
the Emperor Constantius, and besought him, saying, ‘When we first made
our request to you, we were not believed; for we told you, when you sent
for Athanasius, that by inviting him to come forward, you are expelling
our heresy. For he has been opposed to it from the very first, and never
ceases to anathematize it. He has already written letters against us
into all parts of the world, and the majority of men have embraced
communion with him; and <span id="page_280">p. 280</span> <span
id="xx.ii.iv-Page_280"></span>even of those who seemed to be on our
side, some have been gained over by him, and others are likely to be.
And we are left alone, so that the fear is, lest the character of our
heresy become known, and henceforth both we and you gain the name of
heretics. And if this come to pass, you must take care that we be not
classed with the Manichæans. Therefore begin again to persecute, and
support the heresy, for it accounts you its king.’ Such was the language
of their iniquity. And the Emperor, when in his passage through the
country on his hasty march against Magnentius <span
id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md) , he saw the communion of the
Bishops with Athanasius, like one set on fire, suddenly changed his
mind, and no longer remembered his oaths, but was alike forgetful of
what he had written and regardless of the duty he owed his brother. For
in his letters to him, as well as in his interview with Athanasius, he
took oaths that he would not act otherwise than as the people should
wish, and as should be agreeable to the Bishops. But his zeal for
impiety caused him at once to forget all these things. And yet one ought
not to wonder that after so many letters and so many oaths Constantius
had altered his mind, when we remember that Pharaoh of old, the tyrant
of Egypt, after frequently promising and by that means obtaining a
remission of his punishments, likewise changed, until he at last
perished together with his associates.

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p14"></span>31. *Constantius begins to persecute.*

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p15"></span>He compelled then the people in every
city to change their party; and on arriving at Arles and Milan <span
id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604.md) , he proceeded to act entirely in
accordance with the designs and suggestions of the heretics; or rather
they acted themselves, and receiving authority from him, furiously
attacked every one. Letters and orders were immediately sent hither to
the Prefect, that for the future the corn should be taken from
Athanasius and given to those who favoured the Arian doctrines, and that
whoever pleased might freely insult them that held communion with him;
and the magistrates were threatened if they did not hold communion with
the Arians. These things were but the prelude to what afterwards took
place under the direction of the Duke Syrianus. Orders were sent also to
the more distant parts, and Notaries despatched to every city, and
Palatines, with threats to the Bishops and Magistrates, directing the
Magistrates to urge on the Bishops, and informing the Bishops that
either they must subscribe against Athanasius, and hold communion with
the Arians, or themselves undergo the punishment of exile, while the
people who took part with them were to understand that chains, and
insults, and scourgings, and the loss of their possessions, would be
their portion. These orders were not neglected, for the commissioners
had in their company the Clergy of Ursacius and Valens, to inspire them
with zeal, and to inform the Emperor if the Magistrates neglected their
duty. The other heresies, as younger sisters of their own <span
id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605.md) , they permitted to blaspheme the
Lord, and only conspired against the Christians, not enduring to hear
orthodox language concerning Christ. How many Bishops in consequence,
according to the words of Scripture, were brought before rulers and
kings <span id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md) , and received this
sentence from magistrates, ‘Subscribe, or withdraw from your churches,
for the Emperor has commanded you to be deposed!’ How many in every city
were roughly handled, lest they should accuse them as friends of the
Bishops! Moreover letters were sent to the city authorities, and a
threat of a fine was held out to them, if they did not compel the
Bishops of their respective cities to subscribe. In short, every place
and every city was full of fear and confusion, while the Bishops were
dragged along to trial, and the magistrates witnessed the lamentations
and groans of the people.

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p19"></span>32. *Persecution by Constantius.*

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p20"></span>Such were the proceedings of the Palatine
commissioners; on the other hand, those admirable persons, confident in
the patronage which they had obtained, display great zeal, and cause
some of the Bishops to be summoned before the Emperor, while they
persecute others by letters, inventing charges against them; to the
intent that the one might be overawed by the presence of Constantius,
and the other, through fear of the commissioners and the threats held
out to them in these pretended accusations, might be brought to renounce
their orthodox and pious opinions. In this manner it was that the
Emperor forced so great a multitude of Bishops, partly by threats, and
partly by promises, to declare, ‘We will no longer hold communion with
Athanasius.’ For those who came for an interview, were not admitted to
his presence, nor allowed any relaxation, not so much as to go out of
their dwellings, until they had either subscribed, or refused and
incurred banishment thereupon. And this he did because he saw that the
heresy was hateful to all men. For this reason especially he compelled
so many to add their names to the small number <span
id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) of the Arians, his earnest desire
being to collect together a crowd of names, both from <span
id="page_281">p. 281</span> <span id="xx.ii.iv-Page_281"></span>envy of
the Bishop, and for the sake of making a shew in favour of the Arian
impiety, of which he is the patron; supposing that he will be able to
alter the truth, as easily as he can influence the minds of men. He
knows not, nor has ever read, how that the Sadducees and the Herodians,
taking unto them the Pharisees, were not able to obscure the truth;
rather it shines out thereby more brightly every day, while they crying
out, ‘We have no king but Cæsar <span
id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608.md) ,’ and obtaining the judgment of
Pilate in their favour, are nevertheless left destitute, and wait in
utter shame, expecting shortly <span
id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609.md) to become bereft, like the
partridge <span id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610.md) , when they shall
see their patron near his death.

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p25"></span>33. *Persecution is from the Devil.*

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p26"></span>Now if it was altogether unseemly in any
of the Bishops to change their opinions merely from fear of these
things, yet it was much more so, and not the part of men who have
confidence in what they believe, to force and compel the unwilling. In
this manner it is that the Devil, when he has no truth on his side <span
id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611.md) , attacks and breaks down the doors
of them that admit him with axes and hammers <span
id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md) . But our Saviour is so gentle that
He teaches thus, ‘If any man wills to come after Me,’ and, ‘Whoever
wills to be My disciple <span id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) ;’
and coming to each He does not force them, but knocks at the door and
says, ‘Open unto Me, My sister, My spouse <span
id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md) ;’ and if they open to Him, He
enters in, but if they delay and will not, He departs from them. For the
truth is not preached with swords or with darts, nor by means of
soldiers; but by persuasion and counsel. But what persuasion is there
where fear of the Emperor prevails? or what counsel is there, when he
who withstands them receives at last banishment and death? Even David,
although he was a king, and had his enemy in his power, prevented not
the soldiers by an exercise of authority when they wished to kill his
enemy, but, as the Scripture says, David persuaded his men by arguments,
and suffered them not to rise up and put Saul to death <span
id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615.md) . But he, being without arguments
of reason, forces all men by his power, that it may be shewn to all,
that their wisdom is not according to God, but merely human, and that
they who favour the Arian doctrines have indeed no king but Cæsar; for
by his means it is that these enemies of Christ accomplish whatsoever
they wish to do. But while they thought that they were carrying on their
designs against many by his means, they knew not that they were making
many to be confessors, of whom are those who have lately <span
id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md) made so glorious a confession,
religious men, and excellent Bishops, Paulinus <span
id="fr_1617"></span>[1618](#fn_1617.md) Bishop of Treveri, the metropolis
of the Gauls, Lucifer, Bishop of the metropolis of Sardinia, Eusebius of
Vercelli in Italy, and Dionysius of Milan, which is the metropolis of
Italy. These the Emperor summoned before him, and commanded them to
subscribe against Athanasius, and to hold communion with the heretics;
and when they were astonished at this novel procedure, and said that
there was no Ecclesiastical Canon to this effect, he immediately said,
‘Whatever I will, be that esteemed a Canon; the “Bishops” of Syria let
me thus speak. Either then obey, or go into banishment.’

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p34"></span>34. *Banishment of the Western Bishops
spread the knowledge of the truth.*

<span id="xx.ii.iv-p35"></span>When the Bishops heard this they were
utterly amazed, and stretching forth their hands to God, they used great
boldness of speech against him teaching him that the kingdom was not
his, but God’s, who had given it to him, Whom also they bid him fear,
lest He should suddenly take it away from him. And they threatened him
with the day of judgment, and warned him against infringing
Ecclesiastical order, and mingling Roman sovereignty with the
constitution <span id="fr_1618"></span>[1619](#fn_1618.md) of the Church,
and against introducing the Arian heresy into the Church of God. But he
would not listen to them, nor permit them to speak further, but
threatened them so much the more, and drew his sword against them, and
gave orders for some of them to be led to execution; although
afterwards, like Pharaoh, he repented. The holy men therefore shaking
off the dust, and looking up to God, neither feared the threats of the
Emperor, nor betrayed their cause before his drawn sword; but received
their banishment, as a service pertaining to their ministry. And as they
passed along, they preached the Gospel in every place and city <span
id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619.md) , although they were in bonds,
proclaiming the orthodox faith, anathematizing the Arian heresy, and
stigmatizing the recantation of Ursacius and Valens. But this was
contrary to the intention of their enemies; for the greater was the
distance of their place of banishment, so much the more was the hatred
against them increased, while the wanderings of these men were but the
heralding of their impiety. For who that saw them as they passed along,
did not greatly admire them <span id="page_282">p. 282</span> <span
id="xx.ii.iv-Page_282"></span>as Confessors, and renounce and abominate
the others, calling them not only impious men, but executioners and
murderers, and everything rather than Christians?
