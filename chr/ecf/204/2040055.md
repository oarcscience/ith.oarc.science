<span id="vi.ii.i.x"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i.x-p1"></span> §10. *Similar human origin of the Greek
gods, by decree of Theseus. The process by which mortals became
deified.*

<span id="vi.ii.i.x-p2"></span>But this custom is not a new one, nor did
it begin from the Roman Senate: on the contrary, it had existed
previously from of old, and was formerly practised for the devising of
idols. For the gods renowned from of old among the Greeks, Zeus,
Poseidon, Apollo, Hephæstus, Hermes, and, among females, Hera and
Demeter and Athena and Artemis, were decreed the title of gods by the
order of Theseus, of whom Greek history tells us <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120) ; and so the men who pass such decrees
die like men and are mourned for, while those in whose favour they are
passed are worshipped as gods. What a height of inconsistency and
madness! knowing who passed the decree, they pay greater honour to those
who are the subjects of it. 2. And would that their idolatrous madness
had stopped short at males, and that they had not brought down the title
of deity to females. For even women, whom it is not safe to admit to
deliberation about public affairs, they worship and serve with the
honour due to God, such as those enjoined by Theseus as above stated,
and among the Egyptians <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121) Isis and
the Maid and the Younger one <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122) ,
and among others Aphrodite. For the names of the others I do not
consider it modest even to mention, full as they are of all kind of
grotesqueness. 3. For many, not only in ancient times but in our own
also, having lost their beloved ones, brothers and kinsfolk and wives;
and many women who had lost their husbands, all of whom nature proved to
be mortal men, made representations of them and devised sacrifices, and
consecrated them; while later ages, moved by the figure and the
brilliancy of the artist, worshipped them as gods, thus falling into
inconsistency with nature <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123) . For
whereas their parents had mourned for them, not regarding them as gods
(for had they known them to be gods they would not have lamented them as
if they had perished; for this was why they represented them in an
image, namely, because they not only did not think them gods, but did
not believe them to exist at all, and in order that the sight of their
form in the image might console them for their being no more), yet the
foolish people pray to them as gods and invest them with the honour of
the true God. 4. For example, in Egypt, even to this day, the
death-dirge is celebrated for Osiris and Horus and Typho and the others.
And the caldrons <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124) at Dodona, and
the Corybantes in Crete, prove that Zeus is no god but a man, and a man
born of a cannibal father. And, strange to say, even Plato, the sage
admired among the Greeks, with all his vaunted understanding about God,
goes down with Socrates to <span id="page_10">p. 10</span> <span
id="vi.ii.i.x-Page_10"></span>Peiræus <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125) to worship Artemis, a figment of man’s
art.

<span id="vi.ii.i.x-p4"></span> Cf. de la Saussaye, §51. Isis, as

<span id="vi.ii.i.x-p5"></span> The Ν<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.i.x-p5.1"></span>εωτέρα</span> is a puzzle. The most likely
suggestion is that of Montfaucon, who refers it to Cleopatra, who <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.i.x-p5.3"></span>νέα ῎Ισις
ἐχρήματιζε</span> (Plut. *Vit. Anton.*). He cites also a coin of M.
Antony, on which Cleopatra is figured as <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.i.x-p5.5"></span>θέα νεωτέρα</span>. Several such are given by
Vaillant, *de Numism. Cleopatr.* 189. She was not the first of her name
to adopt this style, see Head *Hist. Num.* pp. 716, 717. The text might
be rendered ‘Isis, *both* the Maid and the Younger.’
