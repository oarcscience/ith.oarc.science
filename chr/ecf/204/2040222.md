<span id="xvi.ii.xi"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p1"></span> 16. One day when he had gone forth
because all the monks had assembled to him and asked to hear words from
him, he spoke to them in the Egyptian tongue as follows: ‘The Scriptures
are enough for instruction <span id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018.md) ,
but it is a good thing to encourage one another in the faith, and to
stir up with words. Wherefore you, as children, carry that which you
know to your father; and I as the elder share my knowledge and what
experience has taught me with you. Let this especially be the common aim
of all, neither to give way having once begun, nor to faint in trouble,
nor to say: We have lived in the discipline a long time: but rather as
though making a beginning daily let us increase our earnestness. For the
whole life of man is very short, measured by the ages to come, wherefore
all our time is nothing compared with eternal life. And in the world
everything is sold at its price, and a man exchanges one equivalent for
another; but the promise of eternal life is bought for a trifle. For it
is written, “The days of our life in them are threescore years and ten,
but if they are in strength, fourscore years, and what is more than
these is labour and sorrow <span id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019.md) .”
Whenever, therefore, we live full fourscore years, or even a hundred in
the discipline, not for a hundred years only shall we reign, but instead
of a hundred we shall reign for ever and ever. And though we fought on
earth, we shall not receive our inheritance on earth, but we have the
promises in heaven; and having put off the body which is corrupt, we
shall receive it incorrupt.

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p4"></span>17. ‘Wherefore, children, let us not
faint nor deem that the time is long, or that we are doing something
great, “for the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020.md) .” Nor let us think, as we look at
the world, that we have renounced anything of much consequence, for the
whole earth is very small compared with all the heaven. Wherefore if it
even chanced that we were lords of all the earth and gave it all up, it
would be nought worthy of comparison with the kingdom of heaven. For as
if a man should despise a copper drachma to gain a hundred drachmas of
gold; so if a man were lord of all the earth and were to renounce it,
that which he gives up is little, and he receives a hundredfold. But if
not even the whole earth is equal in value to the heavens, then he who
has given up a few acres leaves as it were nothing; and even if he have
given up a house or much gold he ought not to boast nor be low-spirited.
Further, we should consider that even if we do not relinquish them for
virtue’s sake, still afterwards when we die we shall leave them
behind—very often, as the Preacher saith <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021.md) , to those to whom we do not wish.
Why then should we not give them up for virtue’s sake, that we may
inherit even a kingdom? Therefore let the <span id="page_201">p.
201</span> <span id="xvi.ii.xi-Page_201"></span>desire of possession
take hold of no one, for what gain is it to acquire these things which
we cannot take with us? Why not rather get those things which we can
take away with us—to wit, prudence, justice, temperance, courage,
understanding, love, kindness to the poor, faith in Christ, freedom from
wrath, hospitality? If we possess these, we shall find them of
themselves preparing for us a welcome there in the land of the
meek-hearted.

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p7"></span>18. ‘And so from such things let a man
persuade himself not to make light of it, especially if he considers
that he himself is the servant of the Lord, and ought to serve his
Master. Wherefore as a servant would not dare to say, because I worked
yesterday, I will not work today; and considering the past will do no
work in the future; but, as it is written in the Gospel, daily shows the
same readiness to please his master, and to avoid risk: so let us daily
abide firm in our discipline, knowing that if we are careless for a
single day the Lord will not pardon us, for the sake of the past, but
will be wrath against us for our neglect. As also we have heard in
Ezekiel <span id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022.md) ; and as Judas
because of one night destroyed his previous labour.

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p9"></span>19. ‘Wherefore, children, let us hold
fast our discipline, and let us not be careless. For in it the Lord is
our fellow-worker, as it is written, “to all that choose the good, God
worketh with them for good <span id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023.md) .”
But to avoid being heedless, it is good to consider the word of the
Apostle, “I die daily <span id="fr_1024"></span>[1025](#fn_1024.md) .” For
if we too live as though dying daily, we shall not sin. And the meaning
of that saying is, that as we rise day by day we should think that we
shall not abide till evening; and again, when about to lie down to
sleep, we should think that we shall not rise up. For our life is
naturally uncertain, and Providence allots it to us daily. But thus
ordering our daily life, we shall neither fall into sin, nor have a lust
for anything, nor cherish wrath against any, nor shall we heap up
treasure upon earth. But, as though under the daily expectation of
death, we shall be without wealth, and shall forgive all things to all
men, nor shall we retain at all the desire of women or of any other foul
pleasure. But we shall turn from it as past and gone, ever striving and
looking forward to the day of Judgment. For the greater dread and danger
of torment ever destroys the ease of pleasure, and sets up the soul if
it is like to fall.

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p12"></span>20. ‘Wherefore having already begun and
set out in the way of virtue, let us strive the more that we may attain
those things that are before. And let no one turn to the things behind,
like Lot’s wife, all the more so that the Lord hath said, “No man,
having put his hand to the plough, and turning back, is fit for the
kingdom of heaven <span id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025.md) .” And this
turning back is nought else but to feel regret, and to be once more
worldly-minded. But fear not to hear of virtue, nor be astonished at the
name. For it is not far from us, nor is it without ourselves, but it is
within us, and is easy if only we are willing. That they may get
knowledge, the Greeks live abroad and cross the sea, but we have no need
to depart from home for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, nor to cross
the sea for the sake of virtue. For the Lord aforetime hath said, “The
kingdom of heaven is within you <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[1027](#fn_1026.md) .” Wherefore virtue hath need at
our hands of willingness alone, since it is in us and is formed from us.
For when the soul hath its spiritual faculty in a natural state virtue
is formed. And it is in a natural state when it remains as it came into
existence. And when it came into existence it was fair and exceeding
honest. For this cause Joshua, the son of Nun, in his exhortation said
to the people, “Make straight your heart unto the Lord God of
Israel <span id="fr_1027"></span>[1028](#fn_1027.md) ,” and John, “Make
your paths straight <span id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028.md) .” For
rectitude of soul consists in its having its spiritual part in its
natural state as created. But on the other hand, when it swerves and
turns away from its natural state, that is called vice of the soul. Thus
the matter is not difficult. If we abide as we have been made, we are in
a state of virtue, but if we think of ignoble things we shall be
accounted evil. If, therefore, this thing had to be acquired from
without, it would be difficult in reality; but if it is in us, let us
keep ourselves from foul thoughts. And as we have received the soul as a
deposit, let us preserve it for the Lord, that He may recognise His work
as being the same as He made it.

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p17"></span>21. ‘And let us strive that wrath rule
us not nor lust overcome us, for it is written, “The wrath of man
worketh not the righteousness of God. And lust, when it hath conceived,
beareth sin, and the sin when it is full grown bringeth forth
death <span id="fr_1029"></span>[1030](#fn_1029.md) .” Thus living, let us
keep guard carefully, and as it is written, “keep our hearts with all
watchfulness <span id="fr_1030"></span>[1031](#fn_1030.md) .” For we have
terrible and crafty foes—the evil spirits—and against them we wrestle,
as the Apostle said, “Not against flesh and blood, but against the
principalities and against the powers, against the world-rulers of this
darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly
places <span id="fr_1031"></span>[1032](#fn_1031.md) .” Great is their
<span id="page_202">p. 202</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.xi-Page_202"></span>number in the air around us <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[1033](#fn_1032.md) , and they are not far from us. Now
there are great distinctions among them; and concerning their nature and
distinctions much could be said, but such a description is for others of
greater powers than we possess. But at this time it is pressing and
necessary for us only to know their wiles against ourselves.

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p22"></span>22. ‘First, therefore, we must know
this: that the demons have not been created like what we mean when we
call them by that name; for God made nothing evil, but even they have
been made good. Having fallen, however, from the heavenly wisdom, since
then they have been grovelling on earth. On the one hand they deceived
the Greeks with their displays, while out of envy of us Christians they
move all things in their desire to hinder us from entry into the
heavens; in order that we should not ascend up thither from whence they
fell. Thus there is need of much prayer and of discipline, that when a
man has received through the Spirit the gift of discerning spirits, he
may have power to recognise their characteristics: which of them are
less and which more evil; of what nature is the special pursuit of each,
and how each of them is overthrown and cast out. For their villainies
and the changes in their plots are many. The blessed Apostle and his
followers knew such things when they said, “for we are not ignorant of
his devices <span id="fr_1033"></span>[1034](#fn_1033.md) ;” and we, from
the temptations we have suffered at their hands, ought to correct one
another under them. Wherefore I, having had proof of them, speak as to
children.

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p24"></span>23. ‘The demons, therefore, if they see
all Christians, and monks especially, labouring cheerfully and
advancing, first make an attack by temptation and place hindrances to
hamper our way, to wit, evil thoughts. But we need not fear their
suggestions, for by prayer, fasting, and faith in the Lord their attack
immediately fails. But even when it does they cease not, but knavishly
by subtlety come on again. For when they cannot deceive the heart openly
with foul pleasures they approach in different guise, and thenceforth
shaping displays they attempt to strike fear, changing their shapes,
taking the forms of women, wild beasts, creeping things, gigantic
bodies, and troops of soldiers. But not even then need ye fear their
deceitful displays. For they are nothing and quickly disappear,
especially if a man fortify himself beforehand with faith and the sign
of the cross <span id="fr_1034"></span>[1035](#fn_1034.md) . Yet are they
bold and very shameless, for if thus they are worsted they make an
onslaught in another manner, and pretend to prophesy and foretell the
future, and to shew themselves of a height reaching to the roof and of
great breadth; that they may stealthily catch by such displays those who
could not be deceived by their arguments. If here also they find the
soul strengthened by faith and a hopeful mind, then they bring their
leader to their aid.

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p26"></span>24. ‘And he said they often appeared as
the Lord revealed the devil to Job, saying, “His eyes are as the morning
star. From his mouth proceed burning lamps and hearths of fire are cast
forth. The smoke of a furnace blazing with the fire of coals proceeds
from his nostrils. His breath is coals and from his mouth issues
flame <span id="fr_1035"></span>[1036](#fn_1035.md) .” When the prince of
the demons appears in this wise, the crafty one, as I said before,
strikes terror by speaking great things, as again the Lord convicted him
saying to Job, for “he counteth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood,
yea he counteth the sea as a pot of ointment, and the depth of the abyss
as a captive, and the abyss as a covered walk <span
id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036.md) .” And by the prophet, “the enemy
said, I will pursue and overtake <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037.md) ,” and again by another, “I will
grasp the whole world in my hand as a nest, and take it up as eggs that
have been left <span id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md) .” Such, in a
word, are their boasts and professions that they may deceive the godly.
But not even then ought we, the faithful, to fear his appearance or give
heed to his words. For he is a liar and speaketh of truth never a word.
And though speaking words so many and so great in his boldness, without
doubt, like a dragon he was drawn with a hook by the Saviour <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039.md) , and as a beast of burden he
received the halter round his nostrils, and as a runaway his nostrils
were bound with a ring, and his lips bored with an armlet <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040.md) . And he was bound by the Lord as a
sparrow, that we should mock him. And with him are placed the demons his
fellows, like serpents and scorpions to be trodden underfoot by us
Christians. And the proof of this is that we now live opposed to him.
For he who threatened to dry the sea and seize upon the world, behold
now cannot stay our discipline, nor even me speaking against him. Let us
then heed not his words, for he is a liar: and let us not fear his
visions, seeing that they themselves are deceptive. For that which
appears in them is no true light, but they are rather the preludes and
likenesses of the fire prepared for the demons who attempt to terrify
men with those flames in which they themselves will be burned.
Doubt<span id="page_203">p. 203</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.xi-Page_203"></span>less they appear; but in a moment
disappear again, hurting none of the faithful, but bringing with them
the likeness of that fire which is about to receive themselves.
Wherefore it is unfitting that we should fear them on account of these
things; for through the grace of Christ all their practices are in vain.

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p33"></span>25. ‘Again they are treacherous, and are
ready to change themselves into all forms and assume all appearances.
Very often also without appearing they imitate the music of harp and
voice, and recall the words of Scripture. Sometimes, too, while we are
reading they immediately repeat many times, like an echo, what is read.
They arouse us from our sleep to prayers; and this constantly, hardly
allowing us to sleep at all. At another time they assume the appearance
of monks and feign the speech of holy men, that by their similarity they
may deceive and thus drag their victims where they will. But no heed
must be paid them even if they arouse to prayer, even if they counsel us
not to eat at all, even though they seem to accuse and cast shame upon
us for those things which once they allowed. For they do this not for
the sake of piety or truth, but that they may carry off the simple to
despair; and that they may say the discipline is useless, and make men
loathe the solitary life as a trouble and burden, and hinder those who
in spite of them walk in it.

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p34"></span>26. ‘Wherefore the prophet sent by the
Lord declared them to be wretched, saying: “Wo is he who giveth his
neighbours to drink muddy destruction <span
id="fr_1041"></span>[1042](#fn_1041.md) .” For such practices and devices
are subversive of the way which leads to virtue. And the Lord Himself,
even if the demons spoke the truth,—for they said truly “Thou art the
Son of God <span id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042.md) ”—still bridled
their mouths and suffered them not to speak; lest haply they should sow
their evil along with the truth, and that He might accustom us never to
give heed to them even though they appear to speak what is true. For it
is unseemly that we, having the holy Scriptures and freedom from the
Saviour, should be taught by the devil who hath not kept his own order
but hath gone from one mind to another <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043.md) . Wherefore even when he uses the
language of Scripture He forbids him, saying: “But to the sinner said
God, Wherefore dost thou declare My ordinances and takest My covenant in
thy mouth <span id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044.md) ?” For the demons
do all things—they prate, they confuse, they dissemble, they confound—to
deceive the simple. They din, laugh madly, and whistle; but if no heed
is paid to them forthwith they weep and lament as though vanquished.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p39"></span>27. ‘The Lord therefore, as God, stayed
the mouths of the demons: and it is fitting that we, taught by the
saints, should do like them and imitate their courage. For they when
they saw these things used to say: “When the sinner rose against me, I
was dumb and humble, and kept silence from good words <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md) .” And again: “But I was as a deaf
man and heard not, and as a dumb man who openeth not his mouth, and I
became as a man who heareth not <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046.md) .” So let us neither hear them as
being strangers to us, nor give heed to them even though they arouse us
to prayer and speak concerning fasting. But let us rather apply
ourselves to our resolve of discipline, and let us not be deceived by
them who do all things in deceit, even though they threaten death. For
they are weak and can do nought but threaten.

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p42"></span>28. ‘Already in passing I have spoken on
these things, and now I must not shrink from speaking on them at greater
length, for to put you in remembrance will be a source of safety. Since
the Lord visited earth <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047.md) , the
enemy is fallen and his powers weakened. Wherefore although he could do
nothing, still like a tyrant, he did not bear his fall quietly, but
threatened, though his threats were words only. And let each one of you
consider this, and he will be able to despise the demons. Now if they
were hampered with such bodies as we are, it would be possible for them
to say, “Men when they are hidden we cannot find, but whenever we do
find them we do them hurt.” And we also by lying in concealment could
escape them, shutting the doors against them. But if they are not of
such a nature as this, but are able to enter in, though the doors be
shut, and haunt all the air, both they and their leader the devil, and
are wishful for evil and ready to injure; and, as the Saviour said,
“From the beginning the devil is a manslayer and a father of vice <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048.md) ;” while we, though this is so, are
alive, and spend our lives all the more in opposing him; it is plain
they are powerless. For place is no hindrance to their plots, nor do
they look on us as friends that they should spare us; nor are they
lovers of good that they should amend. But on the contrary they are
evil, and nothing is so much sought after by them as wounding them that
love virtue and fear God. But since they have no power to effect
anything, they do nought but threaten. But if they could, they would not
<span id="page_204">p. 204</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.xi-Page_204"></span>hesitate, but forthwith work evil (for
all their desire is set on this), and especially against us. Behold now
we are gathered together and speak against them, and they know when we
advance they grow weak. If therefore they had power they would permit
none of us Christians to live, for godliness is an abomination to a
sinner <span id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md) . But since they can
do nothing they inflict the greater wounds on themselves; for they can
fulfil none of their threats. Next this ought to be considered, that we
may be in no fear of them: that if they had the power they would not
come in crowds, nor fashion displays, nor with change of form would they
frame deceits. But it would suffice that one only should come and
accomplish that which he was both able and willing to do: especially as
every one who has the power neither slays with display nor strikes fear
with tumult, but forthwith makes full use of his authority as he wishes.
But the demons as they have no power are like actors on the stage
changing their shape and frightening children with tumultuous apparition
and various forms: from which they ought rather to be despised as
shewing their weakness. At least the true angel of the Lord sent against
the Assyrian had no need for tumults nor displays from without, nor
noises nor rattlings, but in quiet he used his power and forthwith
destroyed a hundred and eighty-five thousand. But demons like these, who
have no power, try to terrify at least by their displays <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050.md) .

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p47"></span>29. ‘But if any one having in mind the
history of Job <span id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051.md) should say,
Why then hath the devil gone forth and accomplished all things against
him; and stripped him of all his possessions, and slew his children, and
smote him with evil ulcers? let such a one, on the other hand, recognise
that the devil was not the strong man, but God who delivered Job to him
to be tried. Certainly he had no power to do anything, but he asked, and
having received it, he hath wrought what he did. So also from this the
enemy is the more to be condemned, for although willing he could not
prevail against one just man. For if he could have, he would not have
asked permission. But having asked not once but also a second time, he
shows his weakness and want of power. And it is no wonder if he could do
nothing against Job, when destruction would not have come even on his
cattle had not God allowed it. And he has not the power over swine, for
as it is written in the Gospel, they besought the Lord, saying, “Let us
enter the swine <span id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md) .” But if
they had power not even against swine, much less have they any over men
formed <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053.md) in the image of God.

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p51"></span>30. ‘So then we ought to fear God only,
and despise the demons, and be in no fear of them. But the more they do
these things the more let us intensify our discipline against them, for
a good life and faith in God is a great weapon. At any rate they fear
the fasting, the sleeplessness, the prayers, the meekness, the
quietness, the contempt of money and vainglory, the humility, the love
of the poor, the alms, the freedom from anger of the ascetics, and,
chief of all, their piety towards Christ. Wherefore they do all things
that they may not have any that trample on them, knowing the grace given
to the faithful against them by the Saviour, when He says, “Behold I
have given to you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and upon
all the power of the enemy <span id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054.md) .”

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p53"></span>31. ‘Wherefore if they pretend to
foretell the future, let no one give heed, for often they announce
beforehand that the brethren are coming days after. And they *do* come.
The demons, however, do this not from any care for the hearers, but to
gain their trust, and that then at length, having got them in their
power, they may destroy them. Whence we must give no heed to them, but
ought rather to confute them when speaking, since we do not need them.
For what wonder is it, if with more subtle bodies than men have <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md) , when they have seen them start on
their journey, they surpass them in speed, and announce their coming?
Just as a horseman getting a start of a man on foot announces the
arrival of the latter beforehand, so in this there is no need for us to
wonder at them. For they know none of those things which are not yet in
existence; but God only is He who knoweth all things before their
birth <span id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md) . But these, like
thieves, running off first with what they see, proclaim it: to how many
already have they announced our business—that we are assembled together,
and discuss measures against them, before any one of us could go and
tell these things. This in good truth a fleet-footed boy could do,
getting far ahead of one less swift. But what I mean is this. If any one
begins to walk from the Thebaid, or from any other district, before he
begins to walk, they do not know whether he will walk. But when they
have seen him walking they run on, and before he comes up report his
approach. And so it <span id="page_205">p. 205</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.xi-Page_205"></span>falls out that after a few days the
travellers arrive. But often the walkers turn back, and the demons prove
false.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p56"></span>32. ‘So, too, with respect to the water
of the river, they sometimes make foolish statements. For having seen
that there has been much rain in the regions of Ethiopia, and knowing
that they are the cause of the flood of the river before the water has
come to Egypt they run on and announce it. And this men could have told,
if they had as great power of running as the demons. And as David’s
spy <span id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md) going up to a lofty place
saw the man approaching better than one who stayed down below, and the
forerunner himself announced, before the others came up, not those
things which had not taken place, but those things which were already on
the way and were being accomplished, so these also prefer to labour, and
declare what is happening to others simply for the sake of deceiving
them. If, however, Providence meantime plans anything different for the
waters or wayfarers—for Providence can do this—the demons are deceived,
and those who gave heed to them cheated.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p58"></span>33. ‘Thus in days gone by arose the
oracles of the Greeks, and thus they were led astray by the demons. But
thus also thenceforth their deception was brought to an end by the
coming of the Lord <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) , who
brought to nought the demons and their devices. For they know nothing of
themselves, but, like thieves, what they get to know from others they
pass on, and guess at rather than foretell things. Therefore if
sometimes they speak the truth, let no one marvel at them for this. For
experienced physicians also, since they see the same malady in different
people, often foretell what it is, making it out by their acquaintance
with it. Pilots, too, and farmers, from their familiarity with the
weather, tell at a glance the state of the atmosphere, and forecast
whether it will be stormy or fine. And no one would say that they do
this by inspiration, but from experience and practice. So if the demons
sometimes do the same by guesswork, let no one wonder at it or heed
them. For what use to the hearers is it to know from them what is going
to happen before the time? Or what concern have we to know such things,
even if the knowledge be true? For it is not productive of virtue, nor
is it any token of goodness. For none of us is judged for what he knows
not, and no one is called blessed because he hath learning and
knowledge. But each one will be called to judgment in these
points—whether he have kept the faith and truly observed the
commandments.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p60"></span>34. ‘Wherefore there is no need to set
much value on these things, nor for the sake of them to practise a life
of discipline and labour; but that living well we may please God. And we
neither ought to pray to know the future, nor to ask for it as the
reward of our discipline; but our prayer should be that the Lord may be
our fellow-helper for victory over the devil. And if even once we have a
desire to know the future, let us be pure in mind, for I believe that if
a soul is perfectly pure and in its natural state, it is able <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md) , being clear-sighted, to see more
and further than the demons—for it has the Lord who reveals to it—like
the soul of Elisha, which saw what was done <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md) by Gehazi, and beheld the
hosts <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md) standing on its side.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p64"></span>35. ‘When, therefore, they come by night
to you and wish to tell the future, or say, “we are the angels,” give no
heed, for they lie. Yea even if they praise your discipline and call you
blessed, hear them not, and have no dealings with them; but rather sign
yourselves and your houses, and pray, and you shall see them vanish. For
they are cowards, and greatly fear the sign of the Lord’s Cross, since
of a truth in it the Saviour stripped them, and made an example of
them <span id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md) . But if they
shamelessly stand their ground, capering and changing their forms of
appearance, fear them not, nor shrink, nor heed them as though they were
good spirits. For the presence either of the good or evil by the help of
God can easily be distinguished. The vision of the holy ones is not
fraught with distraction: “For they will not strive, nor cry, nor shall
any one hear their voice <span id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063.md) .”
But it comes so quietly and gently that immediately joy, gladness and
courage arise in the soul. For the Lord who is our joy is with them, and
the power of God the Father. And the thoughts of the soul remain
unruffled and undisturbed, so that it, enlightened as it were with rays,
beholds by itself those who appear. For the love of what is divine and
of the things to come possesses it, and willingly it would be wholly
joined with them if it could depart along with them. But if, being men,
some fear the vision of the good, those who appear immediately take fear
away; as Gabriel <span id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064.md) did in the
case of Zacharias, and as the angel <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065.md) did who appeared to the women at
the holy <span id="page_206">p. 206</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.xi-Page_206"></span>sepulchre, and as He did who said to the
shepherds in the Gospel, “Fear not.” For their fear arose not from
timidity, but from the recognition of the presence of superior beings.
Such then is the nature of the visions of the holy ones.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p69"></span>36. ‘But the inroad and the display of
the evil spirits is fraught with confusion, with din, with sounds and
cryings such as the disturbance of boorish youths or robbers would
occasion. From which arise fear in the heart, tumult and confusion of
thought, dejection, hatred towards them who live a life of discipline,
indifference, grief, remembrance of kinsfolk and fear of death, and
finally desire of evil things, disregard of virtue and unsettled habits.
Whenever, therefore, ye have seen ought and are afraid, if your fear is
immediately taken away and in place of it comes joy unspeakable,
cheerfulness, courage, renewed strength, calmness of thought and all
those I named before, boldness and love toward God,—take courage and
pray. For joy and a settled state of soul show the holiness of him who
is present. Thus Abraham beholding the Lord rejoiced <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066.md) ; so also John <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067.md) at the voice of Mary, the
God-bearer <span id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md) , leaped for
gladness. But if at the appearance of any there is confusion, knocking
without, worldly display, threats of death and the other things which I
have already mentioned, know ye that it is an onslaught of evil
spirits.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p73"></span>37. ‘And let this also be a token for
you: whenever the soul remains fearful there is a presence of the
enemies. For the demons do not take away the fear of their presence as
the great archangel Gabriel did for Mary and Zacharias, and as he did
who appeared to the women at the tomb; but rather whenever they see men
afraid they increase their delusions that men may be terrified the more;
and at last attacking they mock them, saying, “fall down and worship.”
Thus they deceived the Greeks, and thus by them they were considered
gods, falsely so called. But the Lord did not suffer us to be deceived
by the devil, for He rebuked him whenever he framed such delusions
against Him, saying: “Get behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069.md) .” More and more, therefore, let
the deceiver be despised by us; for what the Lord hath said, this for
our sakes He hath done: that the demons hearing like words from us may
be put to flight through the Lord who rebuked them in those words.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p75"></span>38. ‘And it is not fitting to boast at
the casting forth of the demons, nor to be uplifted by the healing of
diseases: nor is it fitting that he who casts out devils should alone be
highly esteemed, while he who casts them not out should be considered
nought. But let a man learn the discipline of each one and either
imitate, rival, or correct it. For the working of signs is not ours but
the Saviour’s work: and so He said to His disciples: “Rejoice not that
the demons are subject to you, but that your names are written in the
heavens <span id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md) .” For the fact that
our names are written in heaven is a proof of our virtuous life, but to
cast out demons is a favour of the Saviour who granted it. Wherefore to
those who boasted in signs but not in virtue, and said: “Lord, in Thy
name did we not cast out demons, and in Thy name did many mighty
works <span id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md) ?” He answered, “Verily
I say unto you, I know you not;” for the Lord knoweth not the ways of
the wicked. But we ought always to pray, as I said above, that we may
receive the gift of discerning spirits; that, as it is written <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md) , we may not believe every spirit.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p79"></span>39. ‘I should have liked to speak no
further and to say nothing from my own promptings, satisfied with what I
have said: but lest you should think that I speak at random and believe
that I detail these things without experience or truth; for this cause
even though I should become as a fool, yet the Lord who heareth knoweth
the clearness of my conscience, and that it is not for my own sake, but
on account of your affection towards me and at your petition that I
again tell what I saw of the practices of evil spirits. How often have
they called me blessed and I have cursed them in the name of the Lord!
How often have they predicted the rising of the river, and I answered
them, “What have you to do with it?” Once they came threatening and
surrounded me like soldiers in full armour. At another time they filled
the house with horses, wild beasts and creeping things, and I sang:
“Some in chariots and some in horses, but we will boast in the name of
the Lord our God <span id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md) ;” and at
the prayers they were turned to flight by the Lord. Once they came in
darkness, bearing the appearance of a light, and said, “We are come to
give thee a light, Antony.” But I closed my eyes and prayed, and
immediately the light of the wicked ones was quenched. And a few months
after they came as though singing psalms and babbling the words of
Scripture, “But I like a deaf man, heard not <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074.md) .” Once they shook the cell <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) with an earthquake, but I continued
praying with unshaken heart. And <span id="page_207">p. 207</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.xi-Page_207"></span>after this they came again making noises,
whistling and dancing. But as I prayed and lay singing psalms to myself
they forthwith began to lament and weep, as if their strength had failed
them. But I gave glory to the Lord who had brought down and made an
example of their daring and madness.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p83"></span>40. ‘Once a demon exceeding high
appeared with pomp, and dared to say, “I am the power of God and I am
Providence, what dost thou wish that I shall give thee?” But I then so
much the more breathed upon him <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md) , and spoke the name of Christ, and
set about to smite him. And I seemed to have smitten him, and forthwith
he, big as he was, together with all his demons, disappeared at the name
of Christ. At another time, while I was fasting, he came full of craft,
under the semblance of a monk, with what seemed to be loaves, and gave
me counsel, saying, “Eat and cease from thy many labours. Thou also art
a man and art like to fall sick.” But I, perceiving his device, rose up
to pray; and he endured it not, for he departed, and through the door
there seemed to go out as it were smoke. How often in the desert has he
displayed what resembled gold, that I should only touch it and look on
it. But I sang psalms against him, and he vanished away. Often they
would beat me with stripes, and I repeated again and again, “Nothing
shall separate me from the love of Christ <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md) ,” and at this they rather fell to
beating one another. Nor was it I that stayed them and destroyed their
power, but it was the Lord, who said, “I beheld Satan as lightning fall
from Heaven; <span id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md) ” but I,
children, mindful of the Apostle’s words, transferred <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md) this to myself, that you might
learn not to faint in discipline, nor to fear the devil nor the
delusions of the demons.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p88"></span>41. ‘And since I have become a fool in
detailing these things, receive this also as an aid to your safety and
fearlessness; and believe me for I do not lie. Once some one knocked at
the door of my cell, and going forth I saw one who seemed of great size
and tall. Then when I enquired, “Who art thou?” he said, “I am Satan.”
Then when I said, “Why art thou here?” he answered, “Why do the monks
and all other Christians blame me undeservedly? Why do they curse me
hourly?” Then I answered, “Wherefore dost thou trouble them?” He said,
“I am not he who troubles them, but they trouble themselves, for I am
become weak. Have they not read <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) ,” “The swords of the enemy have
come to an end, and thou hast destroyed the cities?” “I have no longer a
place, a weapon, a city. The Christians are spread everywhere, and at
length even the desert is filled with monks. Let them take heed to
themselves, and let them not curse me undeservedly.” Then I marvelled at
the grace of the Lord, and said to him: “Thou who art ever a liar and
never speakest the truth, this at length, even against thy will, thou
hast truly spoken. For the coming of Christ hath made thee weak, and He
hath cast thee down and stripped thee.” But he having heard the
Saviour’s name, and not being able to bear the burning from it,
vanished.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p90"></span>42. ‘If, therefore, the devil himself
confesses that his power is gone, we ought utterly to despise both him
and his demons; and since the enemy with his hounds has but devices of
this sort, we, having got to know their weakness, are able to despise
them. Wherefore let us not despond after this fashion, nor let us have a
thought of cowardice in our heart, nor frame fears for ourselves,
saying, I am afraid lest a demon should come and overthrow me; lest he
should lift me up and cast me down; or lest rising against me on a
sudden he confound me. Such thoughts let us not have in mind at all, nor
let us be sorrowful as though we were perishing; but rather let us be
courageous and rejoice always, believing that we are safe. Let us
consider in our soul that the Lord is with us, who put the evil spirits
to flight and broke their power. Let us consider and lay to heart that
while the Lord is with us, our foes can do us no hurt. For when they
come they approach us in a form corresponding to the state in which they
discover us <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md) , and adapt their
delusions to the condition of mind in which they find us. If, therefore,
they find us timid and confused, they forthwith beset the place, like
robbers, having found it unguarded; and what we of ourselves are
thinking, they do, and more also. For if they find us faint-hearted and
cowardly, they mightily increase our terror, by their delusions and
threats; and with these the unhappy soul is thenceforth tormented. But
if they see us rejoicing in the Lord, contemplating the bliss of the
future, mindful of the Lord, deeming all things in His hand, and that no
evil spirit has any strength against the Christian, nor any power at all
over any one—when they behold the soul fortified with these
thoughts—they are discomfited and turned backwards. Thus the enemy,
seeing Job fenced round with them, withdrew from him; but finding Judas
unguarded, him he took captive. Thus if we are wishful to despise the
enemy, let us ever ponder over the things of the Lord, and let the soul
ever rejoice in hope. And we <span id="page_208">p. 208</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.xi-Page_208"></span>shall see the snares of the demon are
like smoke, and the evil ones themselves flee rather than pursue. For
they are, as I said before, exceeding fearful, ever looking forward to
the fire prepared for them.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p92"></span>43. ‘And for your fearlessness against
them hold this sure sign—whenever there is any apparition, be not
prostrate with fear, but whatsoever it be, first boldly ask, Who art
thou? And from whence comest thou? And if it should be a vision of holy
ones they will assure you, and change your fear into joy. But if the
vision should be from the devil, immediately it becomes feeble,
beholding your firm purpose of mind. For merely to ask, Who art
thou <span id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md) ? and whence comest
thou? is a proof of coolness. By thus asking, the son of Nun learned who
his helper was; nor did the enemy escape the questioning of Daniel <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) .’

<span id="xvi.ii.xi-p54"></span> This materialistic view of demons may
be paralleled from Origen and other fathers (D.C.B. i. 809), but is not
Athanasian. But it would be congenial to the Coptic mind; compare the
story told by Cassian of the Monk Serapion, who, on being convinced that
‘God is a Spirit,’ cried out, ‘You have taken my God from me’ (and see
D.C.B. 1. p. 120).

This quite goes beyond any teaching of Athanasius himself; at the same
time it finds a point of contact in what he says about dreams in *c.
Gent.* 30 (<span class="Greek"><span
