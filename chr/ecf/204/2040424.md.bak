Id. Apr., xii Pharmuthi; Moon 19; Æra Dioclet. 61.*

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Athanasius</span> to the Presbyters
and Deacons of Alexandria, and to the beloved brethren, greeting in
Christ.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xiii-p3"></span>According to custom, I give you
notice respecting Easter, my beloved, that you also may notify the same
to the districts of those who are at a distance, as is usual. Therefore,
after this present festival <span id="fr_4434"></span>[4435](#fn_4434.md) ,
I mean this which is on the twentieth of the month Pharmuthi, the
Easter-day following will be on the vii Id. April, or according to the
Alexandrians on the twelfth of Pharmuthi. Give notice therefore in all
those districts, that Easter-day will be on the vii Id. April, or
according to the Alexandrian reckoning on the twelfth of Pharmuthi. That
you may be in health in Christ, I pray, my beloved brethren.
