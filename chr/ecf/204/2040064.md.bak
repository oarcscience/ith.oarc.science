<span id="vi.ii.i.xix-p1"></span> §19. *The inconsistency of image
worship. Arguments in palliation. (1) The divine nature must be
expressed in a visible sign. (2) The image a means of supernatural
communications to men through angels.*

<span id="vi.ii.i.xix-p2"></span>For what other form do they give them
by sculpture but that of men and women and of creatures lower yet and of
irrational nature, all manner of birds, beasts both tame and wild, and
creeping things, whatsoever land and sea and the whole realm of the
waters produce? For men having fallen into the unreasonableness of their
passions and pleasures, and unable to see anything beyond pleasures and
lusts of the flesh, inasmuch as they keep their mind in the midst of
these irrational things, they imagined the divine principle to be in
irrational things, and carved a number of gods to match the variety of
their passions. 2. For there are with them images of beasts and creeping
things and birds, as the interpreter of the divine and true religion
says, “They became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart
was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and
changed the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image
of corruptible man, and of birds and four-footed beasts and creeping
things, wherefore God gave them up unto vile passions.” For having
previously infected their soul, as I said above, with the
irrationalities of pleasures, they then came down to this making of
gods; and, once fallen, thenceforward as though abandoned in their
rejection of God, thus they wallow <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) in them, and portray God, the Father
of the Word, in irrational shapes. 3. As to which those who pass for
philosophers and men of knowledge <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) among the Greeks, while driven to
admit that their visible gods are the forms and figures of men and of
irrational objects, say in defence that they have such things to the end
that by their means the deity may answer them and be made manifest;
because otherwise they could not know the invisible God, save by such
statues and rites. 4. While those <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) who profess to give still deeper and
more philosophical reasons than these say, that the reason of idols
being prepared and fashioned is for the invocation and manifestation of
divine angels and powers, that appearing by these means they may teach
men concerning the knowledge of God; and that they serve as letters for
men, by referring to which they may learn to apprehend God, from the
manifestation of the divine angels effected by their means. Such then is
their mythology,—for far be it from us to call it a theology. But if one
examine the argument with care, he will find that the opinion of these
persons also, not less than that of those previously spoken of, is
false.

<span id="vi.ii.i.xix-p4"></span> This may refer to Maximus of Tyre
(Saussaye, §11), or to the lost treatise of ‘the divine Iamblichus’
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.i.xix-p4.2"></span>Περὶ
ἀγαλμάτων</span>, which was considered worth answering by Christian
writers as late as the seventh century (Philoponus in Phot. Bibl. *Cod.*
215).

<span id="fn_135"></span>[14:136](2040064.htm#fr_135.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i.xix-p4.4"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i.xix-p5"></span> This is in effect the defence of the
‘Scriptor de Mysteriis’ (possibly Iamblichus, see Bernays ‘2
Abhandlungen’ 1880, p. 37): material means of worship are a means of
access directly to the lower (or quasi-material) gods, and so indirectly
to the higher. Few men can reach the latter without the aid of their
manifestation in the lower; <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.i.xix-p5.2"></span>πάρεστιν ἀ& 204·λως τοῖς ἐνύλοις τὰ ἄ&
203·λα</span> (v. 23, cf. 14).
