<span id="ix.iii-p4"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="ix.iii-p4.1"></span>On the meaning of the phrase</span> ἐξ ἑτέρας
ὑποστάσεως ἢ οὐσίας <span class="c10"><span id="ix.iii-p4.2"></span>in
the Nicene Anathema.</span>

<span id="ix.iii-p5"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="ix.iii-p5.1"></span>Bishop Bull</span> has made it a question,
whether these words in the Nicene Creed mean the same thing, or are to
be considered distinct from each other, advocating himself the latter
opinion against Petavius. The history of the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p5.2"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p5.3"></span>πόστασις</span> is of too
intricate a character to enter upon here; but a few words may be in
place in illustration of its sense as it occurs in the Creed, and with
reference to the view taken of it by the great divine, who has commented
on it.

<span id="ix.iii-p6"></span>Bishop Bull, as I understood him (*Defens.
F. N.* ii. 9. §11.), considers that two distinct ideas are intended by
the words <span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p6.1"></span>οὐσία</span>
and <span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p6.2"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p6.3"></span>πόστασις</span>, in the
clause <span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p6.4"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p6.5"></span>ξ ἑτέρας ὑποστάσεως ἢ
οὐσίας</span>; as if the Creed condemned those who said that the Son was
not from the Father’s essence, and those also who said that He was not
from the Father’s hypostasis or subsistence; as if a man might hold at
least one of the two without holding the other. And in matter of fact,
he does profess to assign two parties of heretics, who denied this or
that proposition respectively.

<span id="ix.iii-p7"></span>Petavius, on the other hand (*de Trin.* iv.
I.), considers that the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p7.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p7.2"></span>πόστασις</span> is but another term for <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p7.3"></span>οὐσία</span>, and that not
two but one proposition is contained in the clause in question; the word
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p7.4"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p7.5"></span>πόστασις</span> not being
publicly recognised in its present meaning till the Council of
Alexandria, in the year 362. Coustant. (*Epist. Pont. Rom.* pp. 274.
290. 462.) Tillemont (*Memoires* S. Denys. d’Alex. §15.), Huet
(*Origenian.* ii. 2. n. 3.), Thomassin (*de Incarn.* iii. 1.), and
Morinus (*de Sacr. Ordin.* ii. 6.), take substantially the same view;
while Maranus (*Præf. ad S. Basil.* §1. tom. 3. ed. Bened.), Natalis
Alexander, *Hist.* (Sæc. 1. *Diss.* 22. circ. fin.), Burton
(*Testimonies to the Trinity,* No. 71), and \[Routh\] (*Reliqu. Sacr.*
vol. iii. p. 189.), differ from Petavius, if they do not agree with
Bull.

<span id="ix.iii-p8"></span>Bull’s principal argument lies in the strong
fact, that S. Basil expressly asserts, that the Council did mean the two
terms to be distinct, and this when he is answering the Sabellians, who
grounded their assertion that there was but one <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p8.1"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p8.2"></span>πόστασις</span>, on the
alleged fact that the Council had used <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p8.3"></span>οὐσία</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p8.4"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p8.5"></span>πόστασις</span> indifferently.

<span id="ix.iii-p9"></span>Bull refers also to Anastasius *Hodeg.* 21.
(22. p. 343.?) who says, that the Nicene Fathers defined that there are
three hypostases or Persons in the Holy Trinity. Petavius considers that
he derived this from Gelasius of Cyzicus, a writer of no great
authority; but, as the passage occurs in Anastasius, they are the words
of Andrew of Samosata. But what is more important, elsewhere Anastasius
quotes a passage from Amphilochius to something of the same effect. c.
10. p. 164. He states it besides himself, c. 9. p. 150. and c. 24. p.
364. In addition, Bull quotes passages from S. Dionysius of Alexandria,
S. Dionysius of Rome (vid. below, *de Decr.* 25–27 and notes), Eusebius
of Cæsarea, and afterwards Origen; in all of which three hypostases
being spoken of, whereas antiquity, early or late, never speaks in the
same way of three <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p9.1"></span>οὐσίαι</span>, it is plain that <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p9.2"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p9.3"></span>πόστασις</span> then
conveyed an idea which <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p9.4"></span>οὐσία</span> did not. To these may be added a
passage in Athanasius, *in Illud, Omnia,* §6.

<span id="ix.iii-p10"></span><span id="page_78">p. 78</span> <span
id="ix.iii-Page_78"></span>Bishop Bull adds the following explanation of
the two words as they occur in the Creed: he conceives that the one is
intended to reach the Arians, and the other the Semi-arians; that the
Semi-arians did actually make a distinction between <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p10.1"></span>οὐσία</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p10.2"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p10.3"></span>πόστασις</span>, admitting
in a certain sense that the Son was from the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p10.4"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p10.5"></span>πόστασις</span> of the Father, while they
denied that He was from His <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p10.6"></span>οὐσία</span>. They then are anathematized in
the words <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p10.7"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p10.8"></span>ξ ἑτέρας οὐσίας</span>; and, as he would seem
to mean, the Arians in the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p10.9"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p10.10"></span>ξ ἑτέρας ὑποστάσεως</span>.

<span id="ix.iii-p11"></span>Now I hope it will not be considered any
disrespect to so great an authority, if I differ from this view, and
express my reasons for doing so.

<span id="ix.iii-p12"></span>1. First then, supposing his account of the
Semi-arian doctrine ever so free from objection, granting that they
denied the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p12.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p12.2"></span>ξ οὐσίας</span>, and admitted the <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p12.3"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p12.4"></span>ξ ὑποστάσεως</span>, yet
*who* are they who, according to his view, *denied* the <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p12.5"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p12.6"></span>ξ ὑποστάσεως</span>, or
said that the Son was <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p12.7"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p12.8"></span>ξ ἑτέρας ὑποστάσεως</span>? he does not assign
any parties, though he implies the Arians. Yet though, as is notorious,
they denied the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p12.9"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p12.10"></span>ξ οὐσίας</span>, there is nothing to shew that
they or any other party of Arians maintained specifically that the Son
was not \[from\] the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p12.11"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p12.12"></span>πόστασις</span>, or subsistence of the Father.
That is, the hypothesis supported by this eminent divine does not answer
the very question which it raises. It professes that those who denied
the <span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p12.13"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p12.14"></span>ξ ὑποστάσεως</span>, were
not the same as those who denied the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p12.15"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p12.16"></span>ξ οὐσίας</span>; yet it fails to tell us who
did deny the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p12.17"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p12.18"></span>ξ ὑποστάσεως</span>, in a sense distinct from
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p12.19"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p12.20"></span>ξ οὐσίας</span>.

<span id="ix.iii-p13"></span>2. Next, his only proof that the
Semi-arians did hold the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p13.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p13.2"></span>ξ ὑποστάσεως</span> as distinct from the <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p13.3"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p13.4"></span>ξ οὐσίας</span>, lies in
the circumstance, that the three (commonly called) Semi-arian
confessions of <span class="c10"><span
id="ix.iii-p13.5"></span>a.d.</span> 341, 344, 351, known as Mark’s of
Arethusa \[i.e. the ‘fourth Antiochene’\], the Macrostich, and the first
Sirmian, anathematize those who say that the Son is <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p13.6"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p13.7"></span>ξ ἑτέρας ὑποστάσεως</span>,
not anathematizing the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p13.8"></span>καὶ μὴ ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ</span>, which he thence
infers was their own belief. Another explanation of this passage will be
offered presently; meanwhile, it is well to observe, that Hilary, in
speaking of the confession of Philippopolis which was taken from Mark’s,
far from suspecting that the clause involved an omission, defends it on
the *ground of its retaining the Anathema (de Synod.* 35.), thus
implying that <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p13.9"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p13.10"></span>ξ ἑτέρας ὑποστάσεως καὶ μὴ ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ</span>
was equivalent to <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p13.11"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p13.12"></span>ξ ἑτέρας ὑποστάσεως ἢ οὐσίας</span>. And it
may be added, that Athanasius in like manner, in his account of the
Nicene Council (*de Decret.* §20. fin.), when repeating its anathema,
drops the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p13.13"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p13.14"></span>ξ ὑποστάσεως</span> altogether, and reads
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p13.15"></span>τοὺς δὲ λέγοντας ἐξ
οὐκ ὄντων</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p13.16"></span>,.…</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p13.17"></span>ἢ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p13.18"></span>ποίημα, ἢ ἐξ ἑτέρας οὐσίας, τούτους
ἀναθεματίζει κ. τ. λ</span>.

<span id="ix.iii-p14"></span>3. Further, Bull gives us no proof whatever
that the Semi-arians *did* deny the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p14.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p14.2"></span>ξ οὐσίας</span>; while it is very clear, if it
is right to contradict so great a writer, that most of them did not deny
it. He says that it is “certissimum” that the heretics who wrote the
three confessions above noticed, that is, the Semi-arians, “*nunquam
fassos,* nunquam fassuros fuisse filium <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p14.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p14.4"></span>ξ οὐσίας</span>, e substantia, Patris
progenitum.” His reason for not offering any proof for this naturally
is, that Petavius, with whom he is in controversy, maintains it also,
and he makes use of Petavius’s admission against himself. Now it may
seem bold in a writer of this day to differ not only with Bull, but with
Petavius; but the reason for doing so is simple; it is because
Athanasius asserts the very thing which Petavius and Bull deny, and
Petavius admits that he does; that is, he allows it by implication when
he complains that Athanasius had not got to the bottom of the doctrine
of the Semi-arians, and thought too favourably of them. “Horum
Semi-arianorum, quorum antesignanus fuit Basilius Ancyræ episcopus,
prorsus obscura fuit hæresis..…ut ne ipse quidem Athanasius satis illam
exploratam habuerit.” *de Trin.* i. x. §7.

<span id="ix.iii-p15"></span>Now S. Athanasius’s words are most distinct
and express; “As to those who receive all else that was defined at
Nicæa, but dispute about the ‘One in essence’ only, we must not feel as
towards enemies.…for, as *confessing that the Son is from the essence of
the Father* and not of other subsistence, <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p15.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p15.2"></span>κ τῆς οὐσίας τοῦ πατρὸς εἶναι, καὶ μὴ ἐξ ἑτέρας
ὑποστάσεως τὸν υἱον</span>,…they are not far from receiving the phrase
‘One in essence’ also. Such is Basil of Ancyra, in what he has written
about the faith” *de Syn*. §41;—a passage, not only express for <span
id="page_79">p. 79</span> <span id="ix.iii-Page_79"></span>the matter in
hand, but remarkable too, as apparently using <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p15.3"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p15.4"></span>πόστασις</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p15.5"></span>οὐσία</span> as synonymous, which is the main
point which Bull denies. What follows in Athanasius is equally to the
purpose: he urges the Semi-arians to accept the <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p15.6"></span>ὁμοούσιον</span>, in
consistency, *because* they maintain the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p15.7"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p15.8"></span>ξ οὐσίας</span> and the <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p15.9"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p15.10"></span>μοιούσιον</span> would not
sufficiently secure it.

<span id="ix.iii-p16"></span>Moreover Hilary, while defending the
Semi-arian decrees of Ancyra or Sirmium, says expressly, that according
to them, among other truths, “non creatura est Filius genitus, sed *a
natura Patris* indiscreta substantia est.” *de Syn.* 27.

<span id="ix.iii-p17"></span>Petavius, however, in the passage to which
Bull appeals, refers in proof of this view of Semi-arianism, to those
Ancyrene documents, which Epiphanius has preserved, *Hær.* 73. and which
he considers to shew, that according to the Semi-arians the Son was not
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.2"></span>ξ οὐσίας τοῦ πατρός</span>.
He says, that it is plain from their own explanations that they
considered our Lord to be, not <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p17.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p17.4"></span>κ τῆς οὐσίας</span>, but <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.5"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.6"></span>κ τῆς ὁμοιότητος</span> (he
does not say <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p17.7"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p17.8"></span>ποστάσεως</span>, as Bull wishes) <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.9"></span>τοῦ πατρὸς</span> and that,
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.10"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.11"></span>νεργεί& 139·
γεννητικῇ</span>, which was one of the divine <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p17.12"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p17.13"></span>νέργειαι</span>, as creation, <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.14"></span>ἡ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.15"></span>κτιστικὴ</span>, was
another. Yet surely Epiphanius does not bear out this representation
better than Athanasius; since the Semi-arians, whose words he reports,
speak of “<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.16"></span>υἱ& 232·ν
ὅμοιον καὶ κατ᾽ οὐσίαν ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς</span>, p. 825 b, <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.17"></span>ὡ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.18"></span>ς</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.19"></span>ἡ σοφία τοῦ σοφοῦ υἱ&
232·ς, οὐσία οὐσίας</span>, p. 853 c, <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p17.20"></span>κατ᾽ οὐσίαν υἱ& 232·ν τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ
πατρός,</span> p. 854 c, <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p17.21"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p17.22"></span>ξουσί& 139· ὁμοῦ καὶ οὐσί& 139· πατρὸς
μονογενοῦς υἱοῦ</span>. p. 858 d, besides the strong word <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p17.23"></span>γνήσιος</span>, ibid. and
Athan. *de Syn.* §41. not to insist on other of their statements.

<span id="ix.iii-p18"></span>The same fact is brought before us even in
a more striking way in the conference at Constantinople, <span
class="c10"><span id="ix.iii-p18.1"></span>a.d.</span> 360, before
Constantius, between the Anomœans and Semi-arians, where the latter,
according to Theodoret, shew no unwillingness to acknowledge even the
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p18.2"></span>ὁμοούσιον</span>,
*because* they acknowledge the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p18.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p18.4"></span>ξ οὐσίας</span>. When the Anomœans wished the
former condemned, Silvanus of Tarsus said, “If God the Word be not out
of nothing, nor a creature, *nor of other essence*, οὐσίας, therefore is
He one in essence, <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p18.5"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p18.6"></span>μοούσιος</span>, with God who begot Him, as God
from God, and Light from Light, and He has the same nature with His
Father.” *H. E.* ii. 23. Here again it is observable, as in the passage
from Athanasius above, that, while apparently reciting the Nicene
Anathema, he omits <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p18.7"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p18.8"></span>ξ ἑτέρας ὑποστάσεως</span>, as if it were
superfluous to mention a synonym.

<span id="ix.iii-p19"></span>At the same time there certainly is reason
to suspect that the Semi-arians approximated towards orthodoxy as time
went on; and perhaps it is hardly fair to determine what they held at
Nicæa by their statements at Ancyra, though to the latter Petavius
appeals. Several of the most eminent among them, as Meletius, Cyril, and
Eusebius of Samosata conformed soon after; on the other hand in
Eusebius, who is their representative at Nicæa, it will perhaps be
difficult to find a clear admission of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p19.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p19.2"></span>ξ οὐσίας</span>. But at any rate he does not
maintain the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p19.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p19.4"></span>ξ ὑποστάσεως</span>, which Bull’s theory
requires.

<span id="ix.iii-p20"></span>On various grounds then, because the
Semi-arians as a body did not deny the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p20.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p20.2"></span>ξ οὐσίας</span>, nor confess the <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p20.3"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p20.4"></span>ξ ὑποστάσεως</span>, nor
the Arians deny it, there is reason for declining Bishop Bull’s
explanation of these words as they occur in the Creed; and now let us
turn to the consideration of the authorities on which that explanation
rests.

<span id="ix.iii-p21"></span>As to Gelasius, Bull himself does not
insist upon his testimony, and Anastasius \[about 700 <span
class="c10"><span id="ix.iii-p21.1"></span>a.d.</span>\] is too late to
be of authority. The passage indeed which he quotes from Amphilochius is
important, but as he was a friend of S. Basil, perhaps it does not very
much increase the weight of S. Basil’s more distinct and detailed
testimony to the same point, and no one can say that that weight is
inconsiderable.

<span id="ix.iii-p22"></span>Yet there is evidence the other way which
overbalances it. Bull, who complains of Petavius’s rejection of S.
Basil’s testimony concerning a Council which was held before his birth,
cannot maintain his own explanation of its Creed without rejecting
Athanasius’s testimony respecting the doctrine of his contemporaries,
the Semi-arians; and moreover the more direct evidence, as we shall see,
of the Council of Alexandria, <span class="c10"><span
id="ix.iii-p22.1"></span>a.d.</span> 362, S. Jerome, Basil of Ancyra,
and Socrates.

<span id="ix.iii-p23"></span><span id="page_80">p. 80</span> <span
id="ix.iii-Page_80"></span>First, however, no better comment upon the
sense of the Council can be required than the incidental language of
Athanasius and others, who in a foregoing extract exchanges <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p23.1"></span>οὐσία</span> for <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p23.2"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p23.3"></span>πόστασις</span> in a way
which is natural only on the supposition that he used them as synonyms.
Elsewhere, as we have seen, he omits the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p23.4"></span>ἢ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p23.5"></span>ὑποστάσεως</span> in the Nicene Anathema, while
Hilary considers the Anathema sufficient *with* that omission.

<span id="ix.iii-p24"></span>In like manner Hilary expressly translates
the clause in the Creed by ex altera substantia vel essentia. *Fragm.*
ii. 27. And somewhat in the same way Eusebius says in his letter, <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p24.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p24.2"></span>ξ ἑτέρας τινὸς ὑποστάσεώς
τε καὶ οὐσίας</span>.

<span id="ix.iii-p25"></span>But further, Athanasius says expressly, *ad
Afros*,—“Hypostasis is essence, <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p25.1"></span>οὐσία</span>, and means nothing else than
simply being, which Jeremiah calls existence when he says,” &c. §4. It
is true, he elsewhere speaks of three Hypostases, but this only shews
that he attached no fixed sense to the word. \[Rather, he abandons the
latter usage in his middle and later writings.\] This is just what I
would maintain; its sense must be determined by the context; and,
whereas it always stands in all Catholic writers for the Una Res (as the
4th Lateran speaks), which <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p25.2"></span>οὐσία</span> denotes, when Athanasius says,
“three hypostases,” he takes the word to mean <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p25.3"></span>οὐσία</span> in that particular sense in which
it is three, and when he makes it synonymous with <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p25.4"></span>οὐσία</span>, he uses it to
signify Almighty God in that sense in which He is one.

<span id="ix.iii-p26"></span>Leaving Athanasius, we have the following
evidence concerning the history of the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p26.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p26.2"></span>πόστασις</span>. S. Jerome says, “The whole
school of secular learning understanding nothing else by hypostasis than
usia, essence,” *Ep*. xv. 4, where, speaking of the Three Hypostases he
uses the strong language, “If you desire it, then be a *new* faith
framed *after* the Nicene, and let the orthodox confess in terms like
the Arian.”

<span id="ix.iii-p27"></span>In like manner, Basil of Ancyra, George,
and the other Semi-arians, say distinctly, “This hypostasis our Fathers
called essence,” <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p27.1"></span>οὐσία</span>. Epiph. *Hær*. 74. 12. fin.; in
accordance with which is the unauthorized addition to the Sardican
Epistle, “<span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p27.2"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p27.3"></span>πόστασιν, ἣν αὐτοὶ οἱ αἱρετικοὶ οὐσίαν
προσαγορεύουσι</span>.” Theod. *H. E.* ii. 6.

<span id="ix.iii-p28"></span>If it be said that Jerome from his Roman
connection, and Basil and George as Semi-arians, would be led by their
respective theologies for distinct reasons thus to speak, it is true,
and may have led them to too broad a statement of the fact; but then on
the other hand it was in accordance also with the theology of S. Basil,
so strenuous a defender of the formula of the Three Hypostases, to
suppose that the Nicene Fathers meant to distinguish <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p28.1"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p28.2"></span>πόστασις</span> from <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p28.3"></span>οὐσία</span> in their
anathema.

<span id="ix.iii-p29"></span>Again, Socrates informs us that, though
there was some dispute about hypostasis at Alexandria shortly before the
Nicene Council, yet the Council itself “devoted not a word to the
question,” *H. E.* iii. 7.; which hardly consists with its having
intended to rule that <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p29.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p29.2"></span>ξ ἑτέρας ὑποστάσεως</span> was distinct from
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p29.3"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p29.4"></span>ξ ἑτέρας οὐσίας</span>.

<span id="ix.iii-p30"></span>And in like manner the Council of
Alexandria, <span class="c10"><span id="ix.iii-p30.1"></span>a.d.</span>
362, in deciding that the sense of Hypostasis was an open question, not
only from the very nature of the case goes on the supposition that the
Nicene Council had not closed it, but says so in words again and again
in its Synodal Letter. If the Nicene Council had already used
“hypostasis” in its present sense, what remained to Athanasius at
Alexandria but to submit to it?

<span id="ix.iii-p31"></span>Indeed the history of this Council is
perhaps the strongest argument against the supposed discrimination of
the two terms by the Council of Nicæa. Bull can only meet it by
considering that an innovation upon the “veterem vocabuli usum” began at
the date of the Council of Sardica, though Socrates mentions the dispute
as existing at Alexandria before the Nicene Council, *H. E.* iii. 4. 5.
while the supposititious confession of Sardica professes to have
received the doctrine of the one hypostasis by tradition as Catholic.

<span id="ix.iii-p32"></span>Nor is the use of the word in earlier times
inconsistent with these testimonies; though it occurs so seldom, in
spite of its being a word of S. Paul \[i.e. [Heb. i.
3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)<span id="ix.iii-p32.1"></span>\],
that testimony is our principal evidence. Socrates’ remarks deserve to
be quoted; “Those among the Greeks who <span id="page_81">p. 81</span>
<span id="ix.iii-Page_81"></span>have treated of the Greek philosophy,
have defined essence, <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p32.2"></span>οὐσία</span>, in many ways, but they had made
no mention at all of hypostasis. Irenæus the Grammarian, in his
alphabetical Atticist, even calls the term barbarous; because it is not
used by any of the ancients, and if anywhere found, it does not mean
what it is now taken for. Thus in the Phœnix of Sophocles it means an
‘ambush;’ but in Menander, ‘preserves,’ as if one were to call the
wine-lees in a cask ‘hypostasis.’ However it must be observed, that, in
spite of the old philosophers being silent about the term, the more
modern continually use it for essence, <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p32.3"></span>οὐσίας</span>, *H. E.* iii. 7. The word
principally occurs in Origen among Ante-Nicene writers, and he, it must
be confessed uses it, as far as the context decides its sense, to mean
subsistence or person. In other words, it was the word of a certain
school in the Church, which afterwards was accepted by the Church; but
this proves nothing about the sense in which it was used at Nicæa. The
three Hypostases are spoken of by Origen, his pupil Dionysius, as
afterwards by Eusebius of Cæsarea (though he may notwithstanding have
considered hypostasis synonymous with essence), and Athanasius (Origen
*in Joan.* ii. 6. Dionys. ap. Basil *de Sp. S.* n. 72. Euseb. *ap.
Socr*. i. 23. Athan. *in Illud Omnia,* &c. 6); and the Two Hypostases of
the Father and the Son, by Origen, Ammonius, and Alexander (Origen *c.
Cels.* viii. 2. Ammon. *ap. Caten. in Joan*. x. 30. Alex. *ap. Theod*.
i. 3. p. 740). As to the passage in which two hypostases are spoken of
in Dionysius’ letter to Paul of Samosata, that letter certainly is not
genuine, as might be shewn on a fitting occasion, though it is
acknowledged by very great authorities.

<span id="ix.iii-p33"></span>I confess that to my mind there is an
antecedent probability that the view which has here been followed is
correct. Judging by the general history of doctrine, one should not
expect that the formal ecclesiastical meaning of the word should have
obtained everywhere so early. Nothing is more certain than that the
doctrines themselves of the Holy Trinity and the Incarnation were
developed, or, to speak more definitely, that the propositions
containing them were acknowledged, from the earliest times; but the
particular terms which now belong to them are most uniformly of a later
date. Ideas were brought out, but technical phrases did not obtain. Not
that these phrases did not exist, but either not as technical, or in use
in a particular School or Church, or with a particular writer, or as
ἅπαξ λεγόμενα*,* as words discussed, nay resisted, perhaps used by some
local Council, and then at length accepted generally from their obvious
propriety. Thus the words of the Schools pass into the service of the
Catholic Church. Instead then of the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p33.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p33.2"></span>πόστασις</span> being, as Maran says, received
in the East “summo consensu,” from the date of Noetus or at least
Sabellius, or of Bull’s opinion “apud *Catholicos* Dionysii ætate *ratum
et fixum* illud fuisse, tres esse in divinis hypostases,” I would
consider that the present use of the word was in the first instance
Alexandrian, and that it was little more than Alexandrian till the
middle of the fourth century.

<span id="ix.iii-p34"></span>Lastly, it comes to be considered how the
two words are to be accounted for in the Creed, if they have not
distinct senses. Coustant supposes that <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p34.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p34.2"></span>ξ οὐσίας</span> was added to explain <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p34.3"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p34.4"></span>ξ ὑποστάσεως</span>, lest
the latter should be taken in a Sabellian sense. On which we may perhaps
remark besides, that the reason why <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p34.5"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p34.6"></span>πόστασις</span> was selected as the principal
term was, that it was agreeable to the Westerns as well as admitted by
the Orientals. Thus, by way of contrast, we find the Second General
Council, at which there were no Latins, speaking of Three Hypostases,
and Pope Damasus and the Roman Council speaking a few years sooner of
the Holy Ghost as of the same hypostasis and usia with the Father and
the Son. Theod. *H. E.* ii. 17. Many things go to make this probable.
For instance, Coustant acutely points out, though Maran and the
President of Magdalen \[Routh, *Rel. Sac.* iii. 383\] dissent, that this
probably was a point of dispute between the two Dionysii; the Bishop of
Alexandria asserting, as we know he did assert, Three Hypostases, the
Bishop of Rome protesting in reply against “Three *partitive*
Hypostases,” as involving tritheism, and his namesake rejoining, “If
because there are Three Hypostases, any say that they are partitive,
three there are, though they like it not.” Again, the influence of the
West shews itself in the language of Athanasius, who, <span
id="page_82">p. 82</span> <span id="ix.iii-Page_82"></span>contrary to
the custom of his Church, of Origen, Dionysius, and his own immediate
patron and master Alexander, so varies his own use of the word, as to
make his writings almost an example of that freedom which he vindicated
in the Council of Alexandria. Again, when Hosius went to Alexandria
before the Nicene Council, and a dispute arose with reference to
Sabellianism about the words <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p34.7"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p34.8"></span>πόστασις</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p34.9"></span>οὐσία</span>, what is this too, but the
collision of East and West? It should be remembered moreover that Hosius
presided at Nicæa, a Latin in an Eastern city; and again at Sardica,
where, though the decree in favour of the One Hypostasis was not passed,
it seems clear from the history that he was resisting persons with whom
in great measure he agreed. Further, the same consideration accounts for
the omission of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p34.10"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p34.11"></span>ξ οὐσίας</span> from the Confession of Mark
and the two which follow, on which Bull relies in proof that the
Semi-arians rejected this formula. These three Semi-arian Creeds, and
these only, were addressed to the Latins, and therefore their compilers
naturally select that synonym which was most pleasing to them, as the
means of securing a hearing; just as Athanasius on the other hand in his
*de Decretis,* writing to the Greeks, omits <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p34.12"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii-p34.13"></span>ποστάσεως</span> and writes <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii-p34.14"></span>οὐσίας</span>.
