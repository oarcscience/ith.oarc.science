<span id="xix.ii.vi-p1"></span> 6. *Outrages of George upon the
Alexandrians.*

<span id="xix.ii.vi-p2"></span>After this they again fastened themselves
upon Alexandria, seeking anew to put us to death: and their proceedings
were now worse than before. For on a sudden the Church <span
id="page_257">p. 257</span> <span id="xix.ii.vi-Page_257"></span>was
surrounded by soldiers, and sounds of war took the place of prayers.
Then George <span id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412.md) of Cappadocia who
was sent by them, having arrived during the season of Lent <span
id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413.md) , brought an increase of evils
which they had taught him. For after Easter week, Virgins were thrown
into prison; Bishops were led away in chains by soldiers; houses of
orphans and widows were plundered, and their loaves taken away; attacks
were made upon houses, and Christians thrust forth in the night, and
their dwellings sealed up: brothers of clergymen were in danger of their
lives on account of their brethren. These outrages were sufficiently
dreadful, but more dreadful than these followed. For on the week that
succeeded the Holy Pentecost \[May 11\], when the people after their
fast had gone out to the cemetery to pray, because that all refused
communion with George, that abandoned person, on learning this, stirred
up against them the commander Sebastian, a Manichee; who straightway
with a multitude of soldiers with arms, drawn swords, bows, and spears,
proceeded to attack the people, though it was the Lord’s day <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414.md) : and finding a few praying (for
the greater part had already retired on account of the lateness of the
hour), he committed such outrages as became a disciple of these men.
Having lighted a pile, he placed certain virgins near the fire, and
endeavoured to force them to say that they were of the Arian faith: and
when he saw that they were getting the mastery, and cared not for the
fire, he immediately stripped them naked, and beat them in the face in
such a manner, that for some time they could hardly be recognised.
