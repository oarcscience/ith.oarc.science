<span id="vi.i-p3"></span> ————————————

<span id="vi.i-p4"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="vi.i-p4.1"></span>This</span> treatise and that which follows it
form in reality two parts of a single work. Jerome (*De Script. Eccl.*)
refers to them as ‘Adversus Gentes Libri Duo.’ They are, however, more
commonly distinguished by the titles given them in the present volume.
Both books, indeed, are mainly directed against the Gentiles, but in the
present treatise the refutation is carried out with more special
reference to the beliefs and worship of the heathen. The two books
belong to the earlier years of Athanasius. The Arian controversy which
broke out (319 <span class="c10"><span
id="vi.i-p4.2"></span>a.d.</span>) probably before his twenty-second
year has left no trace upon them (not even *c. Gent.* 46. 8, see note
there). How long before the limit thus fixed the work was composed it is
impossible to say with certainty. The hint (*c. Gent.* 9. 5) that the
time for the deification of emperors by decree of the Senate might have
come to an end points to the conversion of Constantine as a *terminus a
quo.* And the full maturity of power which marks out the *de
Incarnatione* as a masterpiece of Christian theology inclines us to put
the composition as late as we can. Hence the date usually adopted, viz.
in or shortly before 318 <span class="c10"><span
id="vi.i-p4.3"></span>b.c.</span>, the twenty-first year (probably) of
Athanasius’ age.

<span id="vi.i-p5"></span>The position of the book in relation to the
general history of the theology of Athanasius and of the Church has been
pointed out in the Prolegomena. It remains to sketch its argument, and
tabulate its arrangement: a somewhat more extended summary is prefixed
to each section.

<span id="vi.i-p6"></span>His aim is to vindicate (§1) the Dignity and
reasonableness of the Christian Faith. The main vindication of the Faith
is seen in its practical results. But, that these may produce their
proper effect, a removal of error from the mind is needed. Hence the
necessity of refuting idolatry, which is deduced from the same cause as
evil in general, namely, the departure of man from his original
exemplar, the Logos (§§2–5). By the misuse of his power of conscious
choice, man fell (6–8) into the degradation and illusions (9–15) of
idolatry. He then examines the popular and learned pleas on behalf of
idolatry (16–26), and thus arrives at the central problem of the
conception of God. That God is not Nature is shewn (27–29) by the mutual
dependence of the various constituents of the Universe: no one of these,
therefore, can be God: nor can their totality; for God is not compounded
of parts on which He depends, but is Himself the cause of existence to
all. Such a God as this, the soul of man (30–33) can and, if purified
from sin, will (34) recognise; if her imperfections hinder this, the
spectacle of Reason and Order in the Universe (35–46) will assist her to
recognise the handiwork of God, and the presence of the Logos, and
through him the Father. The reclamation and restoration of sinful and
degraded man can only be effected (47) by a return to the Logos. This
opens the question dealt with in the second book, *de Incarnatione*.

<span id="vi.i-p7"></span>Such is the general drift of the *c. Gentes,*
and its high interest is beyond question. At the same time it may be
admitted that to modern readers much of it fails to commend itself. In
the two-fold work before us Athanasius ‘looks before and after.’ The
second portion, on the Incarnation, waxes rather than wanes in its
significance for modern theology. <span id="page_2">p. 2</span> <span
id="vi.i-Page_2"></span>It is more modern to us than the theology of any
generation since then. But the *c. Gentes,* with its retrospect upon a
past utterly dead <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) to the human
spirit, its arguments addressed to a range of ideas widely remote from
our own, its inadequate view of the genesis and history of heathen
religions, its antiquated physics (36, 44, and the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.i-p8.2"></span>φυσικὸς λόγος</span> of 39),
its occasional glaring fallacies of argument (16 *sub fin.,* 33. 1), is
apt to disappoint the modern student who reads it for the first time.
This may explain its not having been translated before now. But while
the defects of the book are evident at a glance, it grows upon the
reader with repeated study. The moral elevation of its tone,—the firm
grasp of central Christian truths,—the sure insight in dealing with such
problems as evil and sin,—the relation of God to Nature,—the ethical
contrast of Christian theism and heathen polytheism,—the grave humour of
such passages as 16. 5; 10. 4 *fin.;* II. 2 *fin.,* &c.,—and beyond all
this a certain largeness of mind and simple unostentatious fervour of
conviction, stamp the book as a great one, and as the worthy complement
of its more renowned companion.

<span id="vi.i-p9"></span>The two together ‘are, next to Origen’s *de
Principiis,* the first attempt to construct a scientific system of the
Christian religion upon certain fundamental ideas of God and world, sin
and redemption; and they form the ripe fruit of the positive apology in
the Greek Church.’ (Schaff, Nicene Christianity, p. 82.) The polemic
against idolatry and heathen mythology is common to the general class of
Christian apologists, and is to be found in heathen writers like Lucian
and even Porphyry (letter to Anebo). But what distinguishes Athanasius
from previous apologists (excepting Origen) is the novel nature of his
problem. The alliance between philosophy and gross popular idolatry had
given Christian apology a new task. From Porphyry downwards (Porphyry
himself was not consistent in this respect) the Neo-platonist school, in
alarm at the progress of Christianity, had taken up the defence of
popular paganism, endeavouring to subsume its grosser manifestations,
its images, sacrifices, &c., under philosophico-religious principles
(*infra* §19, &c.). The idea of ‘theurgy’ as the necessary initiation
into the higher life colours the teaching of Porphyry, but more strongly
that of his pupil Iamblichus, who died early in the fourth century, and
whose pupils (Ædesius, &c.) were contemporaries of Athanasius. This
degeneration of Platonism, however, went along with the continued study
of Plato, whose dialogues are to some extent common ground between
Athanasius and his opponents (Phædrus, §5, 33, Laws, 33, Timæus, 41,
&c., &c.; but it is not in every case easy to say whether Athan. quotes
Plato merely at second hand, or directly, as he certainly does 10. 4).

<span id="vi.i-p10"></span>It may be remarked finally that in these
early treatises the influence of Origen and his school is more distinct
than in the later works of Athanasius. Not to lay too much stress on his
proof of God’s existence and unity from the Cosmos (cf. Orig. *c. Cels.*
I. 23), the prominence of the philosophic doctrine of the Logos as a
cosmic mediatorial Principle (compare Alexander’s <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.i-p10.1"></span>μεσιτεύουσα φύσις
μονογενής</span>) stands in contrast with his later insistence (cf.
*Orat*. ii. 24, *sq*.) on the directness of the personal agency of God
(see also below, note on *‘In Illud’* 2). The Platonist idea of the
Logos is utilised (*de Incarn.* 41) without sufficient explanation of
its fundamental difference from the Christian doctrine. The influence of
Origenism is traceable in his theory of the nature of evil as purely
negative (cf. §5 with Orig. *c. Cels.* iv. 66), in the explanation (to
which I recall nothing parallel in his later works) of the garden of
Eden as figurative (2. 4, cf. 3. 3), the stress laid on the restoration
of *knowledge* of God through the Logos, and perhaps in the deification
of man through Christ (Orig. *c. Cels.* iii. 28 *sub. fin*.), a thought
which Athanasius brings forward in his later at least as often as in his
earlier writings (see note on *de Incarn.* 54. 3). On the whole,
however, the tendency of Athanasius in the course of the Arian
controversy is to move away from Origen and toward the Western habit of
thought: this is especially exemplified in the history of the term <span
id="page_3">p. 3</span> <span id="vi.i-Page_3"></span>Hypostasis (see
above, Prolegg. chap. II. §3 (2) b, and below Introd. to *Tom. ad Ant*.;
cf. also Introductions to *de Sent. Dionys*. and *ad Afros*). Some of
the more characteristic speculations of Origen have left no trace even
on the earliest works of Athanasius (see Introd. to the next Treatise).
The translation (here as elsewhere, except where it is otherwise stated)
is from the Benedictine text.
