<span id="vii.ii.v-p1"></span> §5. For God has not only made us out of
nothing; but He gave us freely, by the Grace of the Word, a life in
correspondence with God. But men, having rejected things eternal, and,
by counsel of the devil, turned to the things of corruption, became the
cause <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) of their own corruption in
death, being, as I said before, by nature corruptible, but destined, by
the grace following from partaking of the Word, to have escaped their
natural state, had they remained good. 2. For because of the Word
dwelling with them, even their natural corruption did not come near
them, as Wisdom also says <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) : “God
made man for incorruption, and as an image of His own eternity; but by
envy of the devil death came into the world.” But when this was come to
pass, men began to die, while corruption thence-forward prevailed
against them, gaining even more than its natural power over the whole
race, inasmuch as it had, owing to the transgression of the commandment,
the threat of the Deity as a further advantage against them.

<span id="vii.ii.v-p4"></span>3. For even in their misdeeds men had not
stopped short at any set limits; but gradually <span id="page_39">p.
39</span> <span id="vii.ii.v-Page_39"></span>pressing forward, have
passed on beyond all measure: having to begin with been inventors of
wickedness and called down upon themselves death and corruption; while
later on, having turned aside to wrong and exceeding all lawlessness,
and stopping at no one evil but devising all manner of new evils in
succession, they have become insatiable in sinning. 4. For there were
adulteries everywhere and thefts, and the whole earth was full of
murders and plunderings. And as to corruption and wrong, no heed was
paid to law, but all crimes were being practised everywhere, both
individually and jointly. Cities were at war with cities, and nations
were rising up against nations; and the whole earth was rent with civil
commotions and battles; each man vying with his fellows in lawless
deeds. 8. Nor were even crimes against nature far from them, but, as the
Apostle and witness of Christ says: “For their <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) women changed the natural use into
that which is against nature: and likewise also the men, leaving the
natural use of the women, burned in their lust one toward another, men
with men working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that
recompense of their error which was meet.”

[Next: The human race then was wasting, God's image was being effaced,
and His work ruined. Either, then, God must forego His spoken word by
which man had incurred ruin; or that which had shared in the being of
the Word must sink back again into destruction, in which case God's
design would be defeated. What then? was God's goodness to suffer this?
But if so, why had man been made? It could have been weakness, not
goodness on God's part.](2040103.md)
