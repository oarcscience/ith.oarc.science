<span id="xix.ii.xxi-p1"></span> 21. *The Saints fled for our sakes.*

<span id="xix.ii.xxi-p2"></span>The flight of the saints therefore was
neither blameable nor unprofitable. If they had not avoided their
persecutors, how would it have come to pass that the Lord should spring
from the seed of David? Or who would have preached the glad tidings of
the word of truth? It was for this that the persecutors sought after the
saints, that there might be no one to teach, as the Jews charged the
Apostles; but for this cause they endured all things, that the Gospel
might be preached. Behold, therefore, in that they were thus engaged in
conflict with their enemies, they passed not the time of their flight
unprofitably, nor while they were persecuted, did they forget the
welfare of others: but as being ministers of the good word, they grudged
not to communicate it to all men; so that even while they fled, they
preached the Gospel, and gave warning of the wickedness of those who
conspired against them, and confirmed the faithful by their
exhortations. Thus the blessed Paul, having found it so by experience,
declared beforehand, ‘As many as will live godly in Christ, shall suffer
persecution <span id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487.md) .’ And so he
straightway prepared them that fled for the trial, saying, ‘Let us run
with patience the race that is set before us <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488.md) ;’ for although there be continual
tribulations, ‘yet tribulation worketh patience, and patience
experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md) .’ And the Prophet Isaiah when
such-like affliction was expected, exhorted and cried aloud, ‘Come, my
people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors; hide thyself
as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast <span
id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) .’ And so also the Preacher, <span
id="page_263">p. 263</span> <span id="xix.ii.xxi-Page_263"></span>who
knew the conspiracies against the righteous, and said, ‘If thou seest
the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and
justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for He that is higher
than the highest regardeth, and there be higher than they: moreover
there is the profit of the earth <span
id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) .’ He had his own father David for
an example, who had himself experienced the sufferings of persecution,
and who supports them that suffer by the words, ‘Be of good courage, and
He shall strengthen your heart, all ye that put your trust in the
Lord <span id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) ;’ for them that so
endure, not man, but the Lord Himself (he says), ‘shall help them, and
deliver them, because they put their trust in Him:’ for I also ‘waited
patiently for the Lord, and He inclined unto me, and heard my calling;
He brought me up also out of the lowest pit, and out of the mire and
clay <span id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) .’ Thus is shewn how
profitable to the people and productive of good is the flight of the
Saints, howsoever the Arians may think otherwise.
