Epistola Encyclica.</span>

<span id="xvii.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xvii.i-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xvii.i-p3.1"></span>Written A.D.</span> 356.

<span id="xvii.i-p4"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xvii.i-p4.1"></span>This</span> letter was addressed by St.
Athanasius to the bishops of his Province after his expulsion by
Syrianus (Feb. 8, 356), and when the nomination of George the contractor
to the Alexandrian See was already known (§7). But no details of the
persecution of the orthodox in Egypt had reached Athanasius when he
wrote, in fact he mentions it as only beginning (§5). This points to
about the Easter of 356; see Prolegg. ch. ii. §8 (1). The tract thus
opens the series of anti-Arian works composed during the ‘third exile.’
It has indeed been inferred (by Baronius and others) from §22 that the
letter was written thirty-six years after the Nicene Synod, i.e. in 361.
But it was certainly written before the arrival of George, and in the
passage referred to it is the first condemnation of Arius by Alexander,
and not the Council of Nicæa, that is placed thirty-six years ago. The
primary purpose of the letter is to warn the bishops against a formulary
which was on the point of being circulated for their acceptance on pain
of banishment (§5). The creed in question cannot now be identified,—but
it was very possibly the Sirmian Creed of 351 (*de Synod.* 27), not
formally Arian, but evading the Nicene test (§10). He begins,
accordingly, after a general warning (1–4) against being imposed upon by
mere words, and a statement (5) of the tactics of his opponents, by
urging the bishops to hold to the faith of Nicæa, in contrast to the
shifting professions of its opponents (6–8), and to be satisfied with
nothing short of an explicit repudiation of Arianism (9–11). In the
Second Part of the Letter he turns to doctrine. He states (12) the
original Arian position, and confronts it (13) with passages from
Scripture. He challenges the Arians (14) to state any clear belief as to
the nature of the Word, which shall reconcile their premises with the
language of Holy Writ (15, 16). He explains [Prov. viii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)<span id="xvii.i-p4.2"></span> of
the Incarnation, and taxes the Arians with denying this truth, like the
heathen (17). He next taxes them with dissimulation, especially Arius in
his profession to Constantine (18); he describes the death of Arius, and
presses the charge of complicity with a man already judged by God (19).
He urges the bishops (20, 21) to steadfastness and confessorship,
reprobates the coalition of Meletians (22) and Arians, and finally
expresses the conviction (23) that the Emperor Constantius will put an
end to these outrages when informed of the true facts of the case.

<span id="xvii.i-p5"></span>The last section is an anticipation of the
*Apol. ad Constantium*, which Athanasius was probably preparing at the
same time. Not till two years later does he cast aside all hope of the
Emperor and launch out in the bitter invective of the ‘Arian History’
(see *Apol. pro Fuga* 26, note 7).

<span id="xvii.i-p6"></span>The place where this Encyclical was written
is quite uncertain, but it was most probably in the Libyan desert, or in
Cyrenaica (Prolegg. *ubi supr.* note 10). His language (*infr.* §5, note
7) would naturally be such as not to give, through so public a document,
a clue to his pursuers.

<span id="xvii.i-p7"></span>It may be added that in many <span
class="c10"><span id="xvii.i-p7.1"></span>mss.</span>, and in the
editions previous to 1698, this tract was counted as the first of the
‘five’ (or in some cases ‘six’) *Orationes contra Arianos*. For a
discussion of this error, see Montfaucon’s *Monita* to this tract and to
the four *Orationes*.
