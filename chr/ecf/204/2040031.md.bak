<span id="v.iv.iii-p1"></span> §3. *Fundamental Ideas of God, the World,
and Creation.*

<span id="v.iv.iii-p2"></span>The Athanasian idea of God has been
singled out for special recognition in recent times; he has been
claimed, and on the whole with justice, as a witness for the immanence
of God in the universe in contrast to the insistence in many Christian
systems on God’s transcendence or remoteness from all created things.
(Fiske, *Idea of God*, discussed by Moore in *Lux Mundi* (ed. 1) pp.
95–102.) The problem was one which Christian thought was decisively
compelled to face by the Arian controversy (*supra*, p. xxix. *sq.*).
The Apologists and Alexandrians had partially succeeded in the problem
expressed in the dying words of Plotinus, ‘to bring the God which is
within into harmony with the God which is in the universe,’ or rather to
reconcile the transcendence with the immanence of God. But their success
was only partial: the immanence of the Word had been emphasised, but in
contrast with the transcendence of the Father. This could not be more
than a temporary resting-place for the Christian mind, and Arius forced
a solution. That solution was found by Athanasius. The mediatorial work
of the Logos is not necessary as though nature could not bear the
untempered hand of the Father. The Divine Will is the direct and sole
source of all things, and the idea of a *mediatorial nature* is
inconsistent with the true idea of God (pp. 87, 155, 362, comparing
carefully p. 383). ‘All things created are capable of sustaining God’s
absolute hand. The hand which fashioned Adam now also and ever is
fashioning and giving entire consistence to those who come after him.’
The immanence, or intimate presence and unceasing agency of God in
nature, does not belong to the Word as distinct from the Father, but to
the Father in and through the Word, in a word to God as *God* (cf. *de
Decr*. 11, where the language of *de Incarn*. 17 about the Word is
applied to God *as such*). This is a point which marks an advance upon
anything that we find in the earliest writings of Athanasius, and upon
the theology of his preceptor Alexander, to whom, amongst other not very
clear formulæ, the Word is a <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.iii-p2.1"></span>μεσιτεύουσα φύσις μονογενής</span> (Thdt. *H.
E.* ii. 4; Alexander cannot distinguish <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.iii-p2.2"></span>φύσις</span> from <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.iii-p2.3"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.iii-p2.4"></span>πόστασις</span> or <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.iii-p2.5"></span>οὐσία</span>; Father and Son are <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.iii-p2.6"></span>δύο ἀχώριστα
πράγματα</span>, but yet <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.iii-p2.7"></span>τῇ ὑποστάσει δύο φύσεις</span>). This is
indeed the principal particular in which Athanasius left the modified
Origenism of his age, and of his own school, behind. If on the other
hand he resembled Arius in drawing a sharper line than had been drawn
previously between the one God and the World, it must also be remembered
that his God was not the far off purely transcendent God of Arius, but a
God not far from every one of us (*Orat.* ii. p. 361 *sq*.).

<span id="v.iv.iii-p3"></span>That God is beyond all essence <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.iii-p3.1"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.iii-p3.2"></span>περέκεινα πάσης
οὐσίας</span> (*c. Gent*. 2. 2, 40. 2, 35. I <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.iii-p3.3"></span>γενητῆς οὐσίας</span>) is a thought common to
Origen and the Platonists, but adopted by Athanasius with a difference,
marked by the addition of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.iii-p3.4"></span>γενητῆς</span>. That God created all things
out of pure bounty of being (*c. Gent.* §2. 2, §41. 2, *de Incarn.* §3.
3, and note there) is common to Origen and Philo, being taken by the
latter from Plato’s *Timæus*. The Universe, and especially the human
soul, reflects the being of its Author (*c. Gent.* passim). Hence there
are two main paths by which man can arrive at the knowledge of God, the
book of the Universe (*c. Gent.* 34 *fin*.), and the contemplation or
self-knowledge of the soul itself (*ib.* 33, 34). So far Athanasius is
on common ground with the Platonists (cf. Fialon, pp. 270, *sqq.*); but
he takes up distinctively Christian ground, firstly, in emphasising the
insufficiency of these proofs after sin has clouded the soul’s vision,
and, above all, in insisting on the divine Incarnation as the sole
remedy for this inability, as the sole means by which man as he is can
reach a true knowledge of God. Religion not philosophy is the sphere in
which the God of Athanasius is manifest to man. <span
id="page_lxxiii">p. lxxiii</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii-Page_lxxiii"></span>Here, again, Athanasius is
‘Christo-centric.’ With Origen, Athanasius refuses to allow evil any
substantive existence (*c. Gent.* §§2, 6, *de Incarn.* §4. 5); evil
resides in the will only, and is the result of the abuse of its power of
free choice (*c. Gent.* 5 and 7). The evil in the Universe is mainly the
work of demons, who have aggravated the consequences of human sin also
(*de Incarn.* 52. 4). On the other hand, the evil does not extend beyond
the sphere of personal agency, and the Providence of God (upon which
Athanasius insists with remarkable frequency, especially in the *de
Fuga* and *c. Gent.* and *de Incarn.,* also in *Vit. Anton.*) exercises
untiring care over the whole. The problem of suffering and death in the
animal creation is not discussed by him; he touches very incidentally,
*Orat.* ii. 63, on the deliverance of creation in connection with [Rom.
viii. 19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md)<span
