<span id="vi.ii.i.xvii-p1"></span> §17. *The truth probably is, that the
scandalous tales are true, while the divine attributes ascribed to them
are due to the flattery of the poets.*

<span id="vi.ii.i.xvii-p2"></span>What inference then is left to us,
save that while the panegyrics are false and flattering, the actions
told of them are true? And the truth of this one can ascertain by common
practice. For nobody who pronounces a panegyric upon anyone accuses his
conduct at the same time, but rather, if men’s actions are disgraceful,
they praise them up with panegyrics, on account of the scandal they
cause, so that by extravagant praise they may impose upon their hearers,
and hide the misconduct of the others. 2. Just as if a man who has to
pronounce a panegyric upon someone cannot find material for it in their
conduct or in any personal qualities, on account of the scandal
attaching to these, he praises them up in another manner, flattering
them with what does not belong to them, so have their marvellous poets,
put out of countenance by the scandalous actions of their so-called
gods, attached to them the superhuman title, not knowing that they
cannot by their superhuman fancies veil their human actions, but that
they will rather succeed in shewing, by their human shortcomings, that
the attributes of God do not fit them. 3. And I am disposed to think
that they have recounted the passions and the actions of the gods even
in spite of themselves. For since they were endeavouring to invest with
what Scripture calls the incommunicable name and honour of <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) God them that are no gods but mortal
men, and since this venture of theirs was great and impious, for this
reason even against their will they were forced by truth to set forth
the passions of these persons, so that their passions recorded in the
writings concerning them might be in evidence for all posterity as a
proof that they were no gods.

having invented the Arts of Life.' But this is a human and natural, not
a divine, achievement. And why, on this principle, are not all inventors
deified?](2040063.md)
