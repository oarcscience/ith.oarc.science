<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xxix-p1.1"></span>From Letter XLIV</span>.—*(For 372.)
And again, from the forty-fourth Letter, of which the commencement is,
‘All that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ did instead of us and for
us <span id="fr_4556"></span>[4557](#fn_4556) .’*

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xxix-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xxix-p3.1"></span>When</span> therefore the servants of
the Chief Priests and the Scribes saw these things, and heard from
Jesus, ‘Whosoever is athirst, let him come to Me and drink <span
id="fr_4557"></span>[4558](#fn_4557) ;’ they perceived that this was not
a mere man like themselves, but that this was He Who gave water to the
saints, and that it was He Who was announced by the prophet Isaiah. For
He was truly the splendour of the light <span
id="fr_4558"></span>[4559](#fn_4558) , and the Word of God. And thus as
a river from the fountain he gave drink also of old to Paradise; but now
to all men He gives the same gift of the Spirit, and says, ‘If any man
thirst, let him come to Me and drink.’ Whosoever ‘believeth on Me, as
saith the Scripture, rivers of living water shall flow out of his
belly <span id="fr_4559"></span>[4560](#fn_4559) .’ This was not for man
to say, but for the living God, Who truly vouchsafes life, and gives the
Holy Spirit.
