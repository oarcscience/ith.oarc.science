<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Letter VII</span>.—*For 335. Easter-day
iv Pharmuthi, iii Kal. April; xx Moon; Ær. Dioclet. 51; Coss. Julius
Constantius, the brother of Augustus, Rufinus Albinus; Præfect, the same
Philagrius; viii Indict.*

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p2.1"></span>The</span> blessed Paul <span
id="fr_4129"></span>[4130](#fn_4129.md) wrote to the Corinthians <span
id="fr_4130"></span>[4131](#fn_4130.md) that he always bore in his body the
dying of Jesus, not as though he alone should make that boast, but also
they and we too, and in this let us be followers of him, my brethren.
And let this be the customary boast of all of us at all times. In this
David participated, saying in the Psalms, ‘For thy sake we die all the
day; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter <span
id="fr_4131"></span>[4132](#fn_4131.md) .’ Now this is becoming in us,
especially in the days of the feast, when a commemoration of the death
of our Saviour is held. For he who is made like Him in His death, is
also diligent in virtuous practices, having mortified his members which
are upon the earth <span id="fr_4132"></span>[4133](#fn_4132.md) , and
crucifying the flesh with the affections and lusts, he lives in the
Spirit, and is conformed to the Spirit <span
id="fr_4133"></span>[4134](#fn_4133.md) . He is always mindful of God, and
forgets Him not, and never does the deeds of death. Now, in order that
we may bear in our body the dying of Jesus, he immediately adds the way
of such fellowship, saying, ‘we having the same spirit of faith, as it
is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe,
and therefore speak <span id="fr_4134"></span>[4135](#fn_4134.md) .’ He
adds also, speaking of the grace that arises from knowledge; ‘For He
that raised up Jesus, will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present
us before Him with you <span id="fr_4135"></span>[4136](#fn_4135.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p10"></span>2. When by such faith and
knowledge the saints have embraced this true life, they receive,
doubtless, the joy which is in heaven; for which the wicked not caring,
are deservedly <span id="page_524">p. 524</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-Page_524"></span>deprived of the blessedness arising
from it. For, ‘let the wicked be taken away, so that he shall not see
the glory of the Lord <span id="fr_4136"></span>[4137](#fn_4136.md) .’ For
although, when they shall hear the universal proclamation of the
promise, ‘Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead <span
id="fr_4137"></span>[4138](#fn_4137.md) ,’ they shall rise and shall come
even to heaven, knocking and saying, ‘Open to us <span
id="fr_4138"></span>[4139](#fn_4138.md) ;’ nevertheless the Lord will
reprove them, as those who put the knowledge of Himself far from them,
saying, ‘I know you not.’ But the holy Spirit cries against them, ‘The
wicked shall be turned into hell, even all the nations that forget
God. <span id="fr_4139"></span>[4140](#fn_4139.md) .’ Now we say that the
wicked are dead, but not in an ascetic life opposed to sin; nor do they,
like the saints, bear about dying in their bodies. But it is the soul
which they bury in sins and follies, drawing near to the dead, and
satisfying it with dead nourishment; like young eagles which, from high
places, fly upon the carcases of the dead, and which the law prohibited,
commanding figuratively, ‘Thou shalt not eat the eagle, nor any other
bird that feedeth on a dead carcase <span
id="fr_4140"></span>[4141](#fn_4140.md) ;’ and it pronounced unclean
whatsoever eateth the dead. But these kill the soul with lusts, and say
nothing but, ‘let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die <span
id="fr_4141"></span>[4142](#fn_4141.md) .’ And the kind of fruit those have
who thus love pleasures, he immediately describes, adding, ‘And these
things are revealed in the ears of the Lord of Hosts, that this sin
shall not be forgiven you until ye die <span
id="fr_4142"></span>[4143](#fn_4142.md) .’ Yea, even while they live they
shall be ashamed, because they consider their belly their lord; and when
dead, they shall be tormented, because they have made a boast of such a
death. To this effect also Paul bears witness, saying, ‘Meats for the
belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and
them <span id="fr_4143"></span>[4144](#fn_4143.md) .’ And the divine word
declared before concerning them; ‘The death of sinners is evil, and
those who hate the righteous commit sin <span
id="fr_4144"></span>[4145](#fn_4144.md) .’ For bitter is the worm, and
grievous the darkness, which wicked men inherit.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p20"></span>3. But the saints, and they who
truly practise virtue, ‘mortify their members which are upon the earth,
fornication, uncleanness passions, evil concupiscence <span
id="fr_4145"></span>[4146](#fn_4145.md) ;’ and, as the result of this, are
pure and without spot, confiding in the promise of our Saviour, who
said, ‘Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God <span
id="fr_4146"></span>[4147](#fn_4146.md) .’ These, having become dead to the
world, and renounced the merchandise of the world, gain an honourable
death; for, ‘precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His
saints <span id="fr_4147"></span>[4148](#fn_4147.md) .’ They are also able,
preserving the Apostolic likeness, to say, ‘I am crucified with Christ,
nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me <span
id="fr_4148"></span>[4149](#fn_4148.md) .’ For that is the true life, which
a man lives in Christ; for although they are dead to the world, yet they
dwell as it were in heaven, minding those things which are above, as he
who was a lover of such a habitation said, ‘While we walk on earth, our
dwelling is in heaven <span id="fr_4149"></span>[4150](#fn_4149.md) .’ Now
those who thus live, and are partakers in such virtue, are alone able to
give glory to God, and this it is which essentially constitutes a feast
and a holiday <span id="fr_4150"></span>[4151](#fn_4150.md) . For the feast
does not consist in pleasant intercourse at meals, nor splendour <span
id="fr_4151"></span>[4152](#fn_4151.md) of clothing, nor days of leisure,
but in the acknowledgment of God, and the offering of thanksgiving and
of praise to Him <span id="fr_4152"></span>[4153](#fn_4152.md) . Now this
belongs to the saints alone, who live in Christ; for it is written, ‘The
dead shall not praise Thee, O Lord, neither all those who go down into
silence; but we who live will bless the Lord, from henceforth even for
ever <span id="fr_4153"></span>[4154](#fn_4153.md) .’ So was it with
Hezekiah, who was delivered from death, and therefore praised God,
saying, ‘Those who are in hades cannot praise Thee; the dead cannot
bless Thee; but the living shall bless Thee, as I also do <span
id="fr_4154"></span>[4155](#fn_4154.md) .’ For to praise and bless God
belongs to those only who live in Christ, and by means of this they go
up to the feast; for the Passover is not of the Gentiles, nor of those
who are yet Jews in the flesh; but of those who acknowledge the truth in
Christ <span id="fr_4155"></span>[4156](#fn_4155.md) , as he declares who
was sent to proclaim such a feast; ‘Our Passover, Christ, is
sacrificed <span id="fr_4156"></span>[4157](#fn_4156.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p33"></span>4. Therefore, although wicked men
press forward to keep the feast, and as at a feast praise God, and
intrude into the Church of the saints, yet God expostulates, saying to
the sinner, ‘Why dost thou talk of My ordinances?’ And the gentle Spirit
rebukes them, saying, ‘Praise is not comely in the mouth of a
sinner <span id="fr_4157"></span>[4158](#fn_4157.md) .’ Neither hath sin
any place in common with the praise of God; for the sinner has a mouth
speaking perverse things, as the Proverb saith, ‘The mouth of the wicked
answereth evil things <span id="fr_4158"></span>[4159](#fn_4158.md) .’ For
how is it possible for us to praise God with an impure mouth? since
things which are contrary to each other cannot coexist. For what
communion has righteousness with iniquity? or, what fellowship is there
between light and darkness? So exclaims Paul, a minister of the
Gospel <span id="fr_4159"></span>[4160](#fn_4159.md) .

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p37"></span><span id="page_525">p. 525</span>
<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-Page_525"></span>Thus it is that sinners, and
all those who are aliens from the Catholic Church, heretics, and
schismatics, since they are excluded from glorifying (God) with the
saints, cannot properly even continue observers of the feast. But the
righteous man, although he appears dying to the world, uses boldness of
speech, saying, ‘I shall not die, but live, and narrate all Thy
marvelous deeds <span id="fr_4160"></span>[4161](#fn_4160.md) .’ For even
God is not ashamed to be called the God <span
id="fr_4161"></span>[4162](#fn_4161.md) of those who truly mortify their
members which are upon the earth <span
id="fr_4162"></span>[4163](#fn_4162.md) , but live in Christ; for He is the
God of the living, not of the dead. And He by His living Word quickeneth
all men, and gives Him to be food and life to the saints; as the Lord
declares, ‘I am the bread of life <span
id="fr_4163"></span>[4164](#fn_4163.md) .’ The Jews, because they were weak
in perception, and had not exercised the senses of the soul in virtue,
and did not comprehend this discourse about bread, murmured against Him,
because He said, ‘I am the bread which came down from heaven, and giveth
life unto men <span id="fr_4164"></span>[4165](#fn_4164.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p43"></span>5. For sin has her own special
bread, of her death, and calling to those who are lovers of pleasure and
lack understanding, she saith, ‘Touch with delight secret bread, and
sweet waters which are stolen <span id="fr_4165"></span>[4166](#fn_4165.md)
;’ for he who merely touches them knows not that that which is born from
the earth perishes with her. For even when the sinner thinks to find
pleasure, the end of that food is not pleasant, as the Wisdom of God
saith again, ‘Bread of deceit is pleasant to a man; but afterwards his
mouth shall be filled with gravel <span
id="fr_4166"></span>[4167](#fn_4166.md) .’ And, ‘Honey droppeth from the
lips of a whorish woman, which for a time is sweet to thy palate; but at
the last thou shalt find it more bitter than gall, and sharper than a
two-edged sword <span id="fr_4167"></span>[4168](#fn_4167.md) .’ Thus then
he eats and rejoices for a little time; afterwards he spurneth it when
he hath removed his soul afar. For the fool knoweth not that those who
depart far from God shall perish. And besides, there is the restraint of
the prophetic admonition which says, ‘What hast thou to do in the way of
Egypt, to drink the waters of Gihon? And what hast thou to do in the way
of Asshur, to drink the waters of the rivers <span
id="fr_4168"></span>[4169](#fn_4168.md) ?’ And the Wisdom of God which
loves mankind forbids these things, crying, ‘But depart quickly, tarry
not in the place, neither fix thine eye upon it; for thus thou shalt
pass over strange waters, and depart quickly from the strange
river <span id="fr_4169"></span>[4170](#fn_4169.md) .’ She also calls them
to herself, ‘For wisdom hath builded her house, and supported it on
seven pillars; she hath killed her sacrifices, and mingled her wine in
the goblets, and prepared her table; she hath sent forth her servants,
inviting to the goblet with a loud proclamation, and saying, Whoso is
foolish, let him turn in to me; and to them that lack understanding she
saith, Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine I have mingled for
you <span id="fr_4170"></span>[4171](#fn_4170.md) .’ And what hope is there
instead of these things? ‘Forsake folly that ye may live, and seek
understanding that ye may abide <span
id="fr_4171"></span>[4172](#fn_4171.md) .’ For the bread of Wisdom is
living fruit, as the Lord said; ‘I am the living bread which came down
from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever <span
id="fr_4172"></span>[4173](#fn_4172.md) .’ For when Israel ate of the
manna, which was indeed pleasant and wonderful, yet he died, and he who
ate it did not in consequence live for ever, but all that multitude died
in the wilderness. The Lord teaches, saying, ‘I am the bread of life:
your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the
bread which came down from heaven, that a man should eat thereof, and
not die <span id="fr_4173"></span>[4174](#fn_4173.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p53"></span>6. Now wicked men hunger for bread
like this, for effeminate souls will hunger; but the righteous alone,
being prepared, shall be satisfied, saying, ‘I shall behold Thy face in
righteousness; I shall be satisfied when Thy glory is seen by me <span
id="fr_4174"></span>[4175](#fn_4174.md) .’ For he who partakes of divine
bread always hungers with desire; and he who thus hungers has a
never-failing gift, as Wisdom promises, saying, ‘The Lord will not slay
the righteous soul with famine.’ He promises too in the Psalms, ‘I will
abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread.’ We
may also hear our Saviour saying, ‘Blessed are they who hunger and
thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled <span
id="fr_4175"></span>[4176](#fn_4175.md) .’ Well then do the saints and
those who love the life which is in Christ raise themselves to a longing
after this food. And one earnestly implores, saying, ‘As the hart
panteth after the fountains of waters, so panteth my soul after Thee, O
God! My soul thirsteth for the living God, when shall I come and see the
face of God?’ And another; ‘My God, my God, I seek Thee early; my soul
thirsteth for Thee; often does my flesh, in a dry and pathless land, and
without water. So did I appear before Thee in holiness to see Thy power
and Thy glory <span id="fr_4176"></span>[4177](#fn_4176.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p57"></span>7. Since these things are so, my
brethren, let us mortify our members which are on the earth <span
id="fr_4177"></span>[4178](#fn_4177.md) , and be nourished with living
bread, by faith and love to God, knowing that without faith it is
impossible to be partakers of such bread as this. For our Saviour, when
He called all men to him, and said, ‘If any man <span id="page_526">p.
526</span> <span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-Page_526"></span>thirst, let him
\[come\] to Me and drink <span id="fr_4178"></span>[4179](#fn_4178.md) ,’
immediately spoke of the faith without which a man cannot receive such
food; ‘He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture saith, out of his belly
shall flow rivers of living water <span
id="fr_4179"></span>[4180](#fn_4179.md) .’ To this end He continually
nourished His believing disciples with His words, and gave them life by
the nearness of His divinity, but to the Canaanitish woman, because she
was not yet a believer, He deigned not even a reply, although she stood
greatly in need of food from Him. He did this not from scorn, far from
it (for the Lord is loving to men and good, and on that account He went
into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon); but because of her unbelief, and
because she was of those who had not the word. And He did it
righteously, my brethren; for there would have been nothing gained by
her offering her supplication before believing, but by her faith she
would support her petition; ‘For He that cometh to God, must first
believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that seek Him;’
and that ‘without faith it is impossible for a man to please Him <span
id="fr_4180"></span>[4181](#fn_4180.md) .’ This Paul teaches. Now that she
was hitherto an unbeliever, one of the profane, He shews, saying, ‘It is
not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs <span
id="fr_4181"></span>[4182](#fn_4181.md) .’ She then, being convinced by the
power of the word, and having changed her ways, also gained faith; for
the Lord no longer spoke to her as a dog, but conversed with her as a
human being, saying, ‘O woman, great is thy faith <span
id="fr_4182"></span>[4183](#fn_4182.md) !’ As therefore she believed, He
forthwith granted to her the fruit of faith, and said, ‘Be it to thee as
thou desirest. And her daughter was healed in the self-same hour.’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p64"></span>8. For the righteous man, being
nurtured in faith and knowledge, and the observance of divine precepts,
has his soul always in health. Wherefore it is commanded to ‘receive to
ourselves him who is weak in the faith <span
id="fr_4183"></span>[4184](#fn_4183.md) ,’ and to nourish him, even if he
is not yet able to eat bread, but herbs, ‘for he that is weak eateth
herbs.’ For even the Corinthians were not able to partake of such bread,
being yet babes, and like babes they drank milk. ‘For every one that
partaketh of milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness <span
id="fr_4184"></span>[4185](#fn_4184.md) ,’ according to the words of that
divine man. The Apostle exhorts his beloved son Timothy, in his first
Epistle, ‘to be nourished with the word of faith, and the good doctrine
whereto he had attained.’ And in the second, ‘Preserve thou the form of
sound words which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which are in
Christ Jesus <span id="fr_4185"></span>[4186](#fn_4185.md) .’ And not only
here, my brethren, is this bread the food of the righteous, neither are
the saints on earth alone nourished by such bread and such blood; but we
also eat them in heaven, for the Lord is the food even of the exalted
spirits, and the angels, and He is the joy of all the heavenly
host <span id="fr_4186"></span>[4187](#fn_4186.md) . And to all He is
everything, and He has pity upon all according to His loving-kindness.
Already hath the Lord given us angels’ food <span
id="fr_4187"></span>[4188](#fn_4187.md) , and He promises to those who
continue with Him in His trials, saying, ‘And I promise to you a
kingdom, as My Father hath promised to Me; that ye shall eat and drink
at My table in My kingdom, and sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve
tribes of Israel <span id="fr_4188"></span>[4189](#fn_4188.md) .’ O what a
banquet is this, my brethren, and how great is the harmony and gladness
of those who eat at this heavenly table! For they delight themselves not
with that food which is cast out, but with that which produces life
everlasting. Who then shall be deemed worthy of that assembly? Who is so
blessed as to be called, and accounted worthy of that divine feast?
Truly, ‘blessed is he who shall eat bread in Thy kingdom <span
id="fr_4189"></span>[4190](#fn_4189.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p72"></span>9. Now he who has been counted
worthy of the heavenly calling, and by this calling has been sanctified,
if he grow negligent in it, although washed becomes defiled: ‘counting
the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a profane thing,
and despising the Spirit of grace,’ he hears the words, ‘Friend, how
camest thou in hither, not having wedding garments?’ For the banquet of
the saints is spotless and pure; ‘for many are called, but few
chosen <span id="fr_4190"></span>[4191](#fn_4190.md) .’ Judas to wit,
though he came to the supper, because he despised it went out from the
presence of the Lord, and having abandoned his Life <span
id="fr_4191"></span>[4192](#fn_4191.md) , hanged himself. But the disciples
who continued with the Redeemer shared in the happiness of the feast.
And that young man who went into a far country, and there wasted his
substance, living in dissipation, if he receive a desire for this divine
feast, and, coming to himself, shall say, ‘How many hired servants of my
father have bread to spare, while I perish here with hunger!’ and shall
next arise and come to his father, and confess to him, saying, ‘I have
sinned against heaven and before thee, and am not worthy to be called
thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants <span
id="fr_4192"></span>[4193](#fn_4192.md) ;’—when he shall thus confess, then
he shall be counted worthy of more than he prayed for. For the father
does not receive him as a hired servant, neither does he look upon him
as a stranger, but he kisses him as a son, he brings him <span
id="page_527">p. 527</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-Page_527"></span>back to life as from the dead, and
counts him worthy of the divine feast, and gives him his former and
precious robe. So that, on this account, there is singing and gladness
in the paternal home.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p76"></span>10. For this is the work of the
Father’s loving-kindness and goodness, that not only should He make him
alive from the dead, but that He should render His grace illustrious
through the Spirit. Therefore, instead of corruption, He clothes him
with an incorruptible garment; instead of hunger, He kills the fatted
calf; instead of far journeys, \[the Father\] watched for his return,
providing shoes for his feet; and, what is most wonderful, placed a
divine signet-ring upon his hand; whilst by all these things He begot
him afresh in the image of the glory of Christ. These are the gracious
gifts of the Father, by which the Lord honours and nourishes those who
abide with Him, and also those who return to Him and repent. For He
promises, saying, ‘I am the bread of life; he that cometh unto Me shall
not hunger, and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst <span
id="fr_4193"></span>[4194](#fn_4193.md) .’ We too shall be counted worthy
of these things, if at all times we cleave to our Saviour, and if we are
pure, not only in these six days of Easter <span
id="fr_4194"></span>[4195](#fn_4194.md) , but consider the whole course of
our life as a feast <span id="fr_4195"></span>[4196](#fn_4195.md) , and
continue near and do not go far off, saying to Him, ‘Thou hast the words
of eternal life, and whither shall we go <span
id="fr_4196"></span>[4197](#fn_4196.md) ?’ Let those of us who are far off
return, confessing our iniquities, and having nothing against any man,
but by the spirit mortifying the deeds of the body <span
id="fr_4197"></span>[4198](#fn_4197.md) . For thus, having first nourished
the soul here, we shall partake with angels at that heavenly and
spiritual table; not knocking and being repulsed like those five foolish
virgins <span id="fr_4198"></span>[4199](#fn_4198.md) , but entering with
the Lord, like those who were wise and loved the bridegroom; and shewing
the dying of Jesus in our bodies <span
id="fr_4199"></span>[4200](#fn_4199.md) , we shall receive life and the
kingdom from Him.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p84"></span>11. We begin the fast of forty
days on the twenty-third of Mechir (Feb. 17), and the holy fast of the
blessed feast on the twenty-eighth of Phamenoth (Mar. 24<span
id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p84.1"></span>); and having joined to these six days
after them, in fastings and watchings, as each one is able, let us rest
on the third of the month Pharmuthi (Mar. 29<span
id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p84.2"></span>), on the evening of the seventh day.
Also that day which is holy and blessed in everything, which possesses
the name of Christ, namely the Lord’s day <span
id="fr_4200"></span>[4201](#fn_4200.md) , having risen upon us on the
fourth of Pharmuthi (Mar. 30<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p85.7"></span>),
let us afterwards keep the holy feast of Pentecost. Let us at all times
worship the Father in Christ, through Whom to Him and with Him be glory
and dominion by the Holy Ghost for ever and ever. Amen. All the brethren
who are with me salute you: salute one another with a holy kiss.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p86"></span>There is no eighth or ninth, for
he did not send them, for the reason before mentioned <span
id="fr_4201"></span>[4202](#fn_4201.md) .

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p88"></span>Here endeth the seventh Festal
Letter of holy Athanasius the Patriarch.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.vii-p3"></span> The twentieth Letter, as far as it
is extant, bears a great resemblance with this. In both, the comparison
between natural and spiritual food is enlarged upon, and several of the
same quotations are adduced in them, to illustrate the character of
sinners and their food, as contrasted with righteous, and the
nourishment they derive from God.
