<span id="xix.ii.xviii-p1"></span> 18. *The Saints who fled were no
cowards.*

<span id="xix.ii.xviii-p2"></span>Of a truth no one can possibly doubt
that they were well furnished with the virtue of fortitude. For the
Patriarch Jacob who had before fled from Esau, feared not death when it
came, but at that very time blessed the Patriarchs, each according to
his deserts. And the great Moses, who previously had hid himself from
Pharaoh, and had withdrawn into Midian for fear of him, when he received
the commandment, ‘Return into Egypt <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470.md) ,’ feared not to do so. And again,
when he was bidden to go up into the mountain Abarim <span
id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471.md) and die, he delayed not through
cowardice, but even joyfully proceeded thither. And David, who had
before fled from Saul, feared not to risk his life in war in defence of
his people; but having the choice of death or of flight set before him,
when he might have fled and lived, he wisely preferred death. And the
great Elijah, who had at a former time hid himself from Jezebel, shewed
no cowardice when he was commanded by the Spirit to meet Ahab, and to
reprove Ahaziah. And Peter, who had hid himself for fear of the Jews,
and the Apostle Paul who was let down in a basket, and fled, when they
were told, ‘Ye must bear witness at Rome <span
id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472.md) ,’ deferred not the journey; yea,
rather, they departed rejoicing <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473.md) ; the one as hastening to meet his
friends, received his death with exultation; and the other shrunk not
from the time when it came, but gloried in it, saying, ‘For I am now
ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474.md) .’
