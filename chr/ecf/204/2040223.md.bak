<span id="xvi.ii.xii-p1"></span> 44. While Antony was thus speaking all
rejoiced; in some the love of virtue increased, in others carelessness
was thrown aside, the self-conceit of others was stopped; and all were
persuaded to despise the assaults of the Evil One, and marvelled at the
grace given to Antony from the Lord for the discerning of spirits. So
their cells were in the mountains, like filled with holy bands of men
who sang psalms, loved reading, fasted, prayed, rejoiced in the hope of
things to come, laboured in alms-giving, and preserved love and harmony
one with another. And truly it was possible, as it were, to behold a
land set by itself, filled with piety and justice. For then there was
neither the evil-doer, nor the injured, nor the reproaches of the
tax-gatherer: but instead a multitude of ascetics; and the one purpose
of them all was to aim at virtue. So that any one beholding the cells
again, and seeing such good order among the monks, would lift up his
voice and say, ‘How goodly are thy dwellings, O Jacob, and thy tents, O
Israel; as shady glens and as a garden <span

hath pitched, and like cedars near waters <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) .’
