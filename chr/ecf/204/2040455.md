<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Letter LVIII</span>.—*Second Letter to
Orsisius*.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiii-p2"></span>‘<span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xiii-p2.1"></span>But</span> the most holy Archbishop
Athanasius, when he heard about our father Theodorus, was grieved, and
sent this letter to the Abbat Orsisius and the brethren to console them
for his decease, as follows:’—

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiii-p3"></span>Athanasius to Orsisius, Abbat,
father of monks, and to all with him who practise the solitary life, and
are settled in faith in God, beloved brethren most longed for in the
Lord, greeting.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiii-p4"></span>I have heard about the decease of
the blessed Theodorus <span id="fr_4694"></span>[4695](#fn_4694.md) , and
the tidings caused me great anxiety, knowing as I did his value to you.
Now if it had not been Theodorus, I should have used many words to you,
with tears, considering what follows after death. But since it is
Theodorus whom you and I have known, what need I say in my letter save
‘Blessed is’ Theodorus, ‘who hath not walked in the council of the
ungodly <span id="fr_4695"></span>[4696](#fn_4695.md) ?’ But if ‘he is
blessed that feareth the Lord <span id="fr_4696"></span>[4697](#fn_4696.md)
,’ we may now confidently call him blessed, having the firm assurance
that he has reached as it were a haven, and has a life without care.
Would that the same had also befallen each one of us; would that each of
us in his running might thus arrive; would that each of us, on his
voyage, might moor his own bark there in the stormless haven, so that,
at rest with the fathers, he might say, ‘here will I dwell, for I have a
delight therein <span id="fr_4697"></span>[4698](#fn_4697.md) .’ Wherefore,
brethren beloved and most longed-for, weep not for Theodorus, for he ‘is
not dead, but sleepeth <span id="fr_4698"></span>[4699](#fn_4698.md) .’
<span id="page_570">p. 570</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xiii-Page_570"></span>Let none weep when he remembers
him, but imitate his life. For one must not grieve over one that is gone
to the place where grief is not. This I write to you all in common; but
especially to you, beloved and most longed for Orsisius, in order that
now that he is fallen asleep, you may take up the whole charge, and take
his place among the brethren. For while he survived, you two were as
one, and when one was away, the work of both was carried on: and when
both were there you were as one, discoursing to the beloved ones what
made for their good. Thus act, then, and so doing write and tell me of
the safety of yourself and of the brotherhood. And I exhort you all to
pray together that the Lord may grant further peace to the Churches. For
we now kept festival with joy, both Easter and Pentecost, and we rejoice
in the benefits of the Lord. I write to you all. Greet all who fear the
Lord. Those with me greet you. I pray that you may be well in the Lord,
beloved and much-longed-for brethren.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xiii-p5"></span> On Theodore see Amelineau, *S.
Pakhôme,* &c., pp. xcv.–xcvii. The death of Theodore is fixed for April
27, 364, on the following grounds. He died (*Vit. Pachom.* 95) of a
short and sudden illness, on Pachon 2 (April 27), and shortly after
Easter. Moreover his death took place 18 years after that of Pachomius.
But Ammon (as he tells us himself, *supr.* p. 487) became a Christian
and a monk ‘a year and more’ after March 15, 351 (proclamation of Gallus
as Cæsar), and six years after the death of Pachomius. (*Ep. Amm.* 4,
5.) This dates the latter event *a little less than five years before*
March 15, 351. But Pachomius died, according to his *Life,* on Pachon 14
(May 9), of an epidemic which attacked the community after Easter. This
double condition is satisfied by the year 346, in which Easter fell on
Pharm. 4, forty days before the day of Pachomius’ decease. If then
Pachomius died in 346, Theodore died in 364. Against this result we have
(1) the fact that in that year April 27 was twenty-three days after
Easter; but the Easter gathering of the monks would last over April 11
(Low Sunday), and the death of Theodore would come suddenly enough a
fortnight later; (2) the fragment (*supr.* p. 551) probably belonging to
Letter 39, which a coptic life of Theodore makes him state that he
received before his last Easter. But this cannot be correct; for all
known data forbid us to place the death of Theodore as late as 367.
(Tillemont’s tentative opinion, vii. 691, 761, is bound up with an
obsolete chronology of the exiles of Athan.) On the other hand Theodore
cannot have died as early as 363. Athanasius was with him (*supr.* p.
487) in the summer of that year, and when our present letter was written
Ath. had clearly kept Easter at home, which suits 364, but excludes 363.
