<span id="vi.ii.i.xiv-p1"></span> §14. *Image worship condemned by
Scripture.*

<span id="vi.ii.i.xiv-p2"></span>But better testimony about all this is
furnished by Holy Scripture, which tells us beforehand when it
says <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) , “Their idols are silver
and gold, the work of men’s hands. Eyes have they and will not see; a
mouth have they and will not speak; ears have they and will not hear;
noses have they and will not smell; hands have they and will not handle;
feet have they and will not walk; they will not speak through their
throat. Like unto them be they that make them.” Nor have they escaped
prophetic censure; for there also is their refutation, where the Spirit
says <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) , “they shall be ashamed
that have formed a god, and carved all of them that which is vain: and
all by whom they were made are dried up: and let the deaf ones among men
all assemble and stand up together, and let them be confounded and put
to shame together; for the carpenter sharpened iron, and worked it with
an adze, and fashioned it with an auger, and set it up with the arm of
his strength: and he shall hunger and be faint, and drink no water. For
the carpenter chose out wood, and set it by a rule, and fashioned it
with glue, and made it as the form of a man and as the beauty of man,
and set it up in his house, wood which he had cut from the grove and
which the Lord planted, and the rain gave it growth that it might be for
men to burn, and that he might take thereof and warm himself, and
kindle, and bake bread upon it, but the residue they made into gods, and
worshipped them, the half whereof they had burned in the fire. And upon
the half thereof he roasted flesh and ate and was filled, and was warmed
and said: ‘It is pleasant to me, because I am warmed and have seen the
fire.’ But the residue thereof he worshipped, saying, ‘Deliver me for
thou art my god.’ They <span id="page_12">p. 12</span> <span
id="vi.ii.i.xiv-Page_12"></span>knew not nor understood, because their
eyes were dimmed that they could not see, nor perceive with their heart;
nor did he consider in his heart nor know in his understanding that he
had burned half thereof in the fire, and baked bread upon the coals
thereof, and roasted flesh and eaten it, and made the residue thereof an
abomination, and they worship it. Know that their heart is dust and they
are deceived, and none can deliver his soul. Behold and will ye not say,
‘There is a lie in my right hand?’” 2. How then can they fail to be
judged godless by all, who even by the divine Scripture are accused of
impiety? or how can they be anything but miserable, who are thus openly
convicted of worshipping dead things instead of the truth? or what kind
of hope have they? or what kind of excuse could be made for them,
trusting in things without sense or movement, which they reverence in
place of the true God?
