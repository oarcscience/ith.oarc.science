<span id="xvi.ii.vi-p1"></span> 7. This was Antony’s first struggle
against the devil, or rather this victory was the Saviour’s work in
Antony <span id="fr_1004"></span>[1005](#fn_1004.md) , ‘Who condemned sin
in the flesh that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us who
walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.’ But neither did Antony,
although the evil one had fallen, henceforth relax his care and despise
him; nor did the enemy as though conquered cease to lay snares for him.
For again he went round as a lion seeking some occasion against him. But
Antony having learned from the Scriptures that the devices <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005.md) of the devil are many, zealously
continued the discipline, reckoning that though the devil had not been
able to deceive his heart by bodily pleasure, he would endeavour to
ensnare him by other means. For the demon loves sin. Wherefore more and
more he repressed the body and kept it in subjection <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[1007](#fn_1006.md) , lest haply having conquered on
one side, he should be dragged down on the other. He therefore planned
to accustom himself to a severer mode of life. And many marvelled, but
he himself used to bear the labour easily; for the eagerness of soul,
through the length of time it had abode in him, had wrought a good habit
in him, so that taking but little initiation from others he shewed great
zeal in this matter. He kept vigil to such an extent that he often
continued <span id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vi-Page_198"></span>the whole night without sleep; and this
not once but often, to the marvel of others. He ate once a day, after
sunset, sometimes once in two days, and often even in four. His food was
bread and salt, his drink, water only. Of flesh and wine it is
superfluous even to speak, since no such thing was found with the other
earnest men. A rush mat served him to sleep upon, but for the most part
he lay upon the bare ground. He would not anoint himself with oil,
saying it behoved young men to be earnest in training and not to seek
what would enervate the body; but they must accustom it to labour,
mindful of the Apostle’s words <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007.md) , ‘when I am weak, then am I
strong.’ ‘For,’ said he, ‘the fibre of the soul is then sound when the
pleasures of the body are diminished.’ And he had come to this truly
wonderful conclusion, ‘that progress in virtue, and retirement from the
world for the sake of it, ought not to be measured by time, but by
desire and fixity of purpose.’ He at least gave no thought to the past,
but day by day, as if he were at the beginning of his discipline,
applied greater pains for advancement, often repeating to himself the
saying of Paul <span id="fr_1008"></span>[1009](#fn_1008.md) : ‘Forgetting
the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which
are before.’ He was also mindful of the words spoken by the prophet
Elias <span id="fr_1009"></span>[1010](#fn_1009.md) , ‘the Lord liveth
before whose presence I stand to-day.’ For he observed that in saying
‘to-day’ the prophet did not compute the time that had gone by: but
daily as though ever commencing he eagerly endeavoured to make himself
fit to appear before God, being pure in heart and ever ready to submit
to His counsel, and to Him alone. And he used to say to himself that
from the life of the great Elias the hermit ought to see his own as in a
mirror.
