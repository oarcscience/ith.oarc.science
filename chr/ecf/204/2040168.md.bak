<span id="xi.ii.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xi.ii.i-p3"></span>§*1. This text refers not to the eternal
Word but to the Incarnate.*

<span id="xi.ii.i-p4"></span>“All things were delivered to Me by My
Father. And none knoweth Who the Son is, save the Father; and Who the
Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal
Him.”

<span id="xi.ii.i-p5"></span>And from not perceiving this they of the
sect of Arius, Eusebius and his fellows, indulge impiety against the
Lord. For they say, if all things were delivered (meaning by ‘all’ the
Lordship of Creation), there was once a time when He had them not. But
if He had them not, He is not of the Father, for if He were, He would on
that account have had them always, and would not have required to
receive them. But this point will furnish all the clearer an exposure of
their folly. For the expression in question does not refer to the
Lordship over Creation, nor to presiding over the works of God, but is
meant to reveal in part the intention of the Incarnation (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.i-p5.1"></span>τῆς οἰκονομίας</span>). For
if when He was speaking they ‘were delivered’ to Him, clearly before He
received them, creation was void of the Word. What then becomes of the
text “in Him all things consist” ([Col. i.
17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017)<span id="xi.ii.i-p5.2"></span>.md)?
But if simultaneously with the origin of the Creation it was all
‘delivered’ to Him, such delivery were superfluous, for ‘all things were
made by Him’ ([Joh. i. 3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md)<span
id="xi.ii.i-p5.3"></span>), and it would be unnecessary for those things
of which the Lord Himself was the artificer to be delivered over to Him.
For in making them He was Lord of the things which were being
originated. But even supposing they were ‘delivered’ to Him after they
were originated, see the monstrosity. For if they ‘were delivered,’ and
upon His receiving them the Father retired, then we are in peril of
falling into the fabulous tales which some tell, that He gave over \[His
works\] to the Son, and Himself departed. Or if, while the Son has them,
the Father has them also, we ought to say, not ‘were delivered,’ but
that He took Him as partner, as Paul did Silvanus. But this is even more
monstrous; for God is not imperfect <span
id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) , nor did He summon the Son to help
Him in His need; but, being Father of the Word, He makes all things by
His means, and without delivering creation over to Him, by His means and
in Him exercises Providence over it, so that not even a sparrow falls to
the ground without the Father ([Matt. x.
29](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029)<span id="xi.ii.i-p6.2"></span>.md),
nor is the grass clothed without God ([Matt.
6.30](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#030)<span id="xi.ii.i-p6.3"></span>.md),
but at once the Father worketh, and the Son worketh hitherto (cf. [Joh.
v. 17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017)<span id="xi.ii.i-p6.4"></span>.md).
Vain, therefore, is the opinion of the impious. For the expression is
not what they think, but designates the Incarnation.
