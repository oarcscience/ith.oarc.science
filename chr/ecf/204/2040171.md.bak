<span id="xi.ii.iv-p1"></span> §4. *The text* <span
id="xi.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>*[John xvi.
15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#015.md)<span id="xi.ii.iv-p1.2"></span>,
shews clearly the essential relation of the Son to the Father.*

<span id="xi.ii.iv-p2"></span>As then the light from the Sun which
illumines the world could never be supposed, by men of sound mind, to do
so without the Sun, since the Sun’s light is united to the Sun by
nature; and as, if the Light <span id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md)
were to say: I have received from the Sun the power of illumining all
things, and of giving growth and strength to them by the heat that is in
me, no one will be mad enough to think that the mention of the Sun is
meant to separate him from what is his nature, namely the light; so
piety would have us perceive that the Divine Essence of the Word is
united by nature to His own Father. For the text before us will put our
problem in the clearest possible light, seeing that the Saviour said,
‘All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine;’ which shews that He is
ever with the Father. For ‘whatsoever He hath’ shews that the Father
wields the Lordship, while ‘are Mine’ shews the inseparable union. It is
necessary, then, that we should perceive that in the Father reside
Everlastingness, Eternity, Immortality. Now these reside in Him not as
adventitious attributes, but, as it were, in a well-spring they reside
in Him, and in the Son. When then you wish to perceive what relates to
the Son, learn what is in the Father, for this is what you must believe
to be in the Son. If then the Father is a thing created or made, these
qualities belong also to the Son. And if it is permissible to say of the
Father ‘there was once a time when He was not,’ or ‘made of nothing,’
let these words be applied also to the Son. But if it is impious to
ascribe these attributes to the Father, grant that it is impious also to
ascribe them to the Son. For what belongs to the Father, belongs to the
Son. For he that honoureth the Son, honoureth the Father that sent Him,
and he that receiveth the Son, receiveth the Father with Him, because he
that hath seen the Son hath seen the Father ([Matt.
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040.md), [John
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009)<span id="xi.ii.iv-p3.2"></span>.md).
As then the Father is not a creature, so neither is the Son; and as it
is not possible to say of Him ‘there was a time when He was not,’ nor
‘made of nothing,’ so it is not proper to say the like of the Son
either. But rather, as the Father’s attributes are Everlastingness,
Immortality, Eternity, and the being no creature, it follows that thus
also we must think of the Son. For as it is written ([Joh. v.
26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026)<span id="xi.ii.iv-p3.3"></span>.md),
‘As the Father hath life in Himself, so gave He to the Son also to have
life in Himself.’ But He uses the word ‘gave’ in order to point to the
Father who gives. As, again, life is in the Father, so also is it in the
Son, so as to shew Him to be inseparable and everlasting. For this is
why He speaks with exactness, ‘whatsoever the Father hath,’ in order
namely that by thus mentioning the Father He may avoid being thought to
be the Father Himself. For He does not say ‘I am the Father,’ but
‘whatsoever the Father hath.’
