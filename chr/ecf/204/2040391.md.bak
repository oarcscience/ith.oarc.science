<span id="xxii.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xxii.i-p3"></span>(<span class="c10"><span
id="xxii.i-p3.1"></span>Written</span> 359, <span class="c10"><span
id="xxii.i-p3.2"></span>Added to After</span> 361.)

<span id="xxii.i-p4"></span>The *de Synodis* is the last of the great
and important group of writings of the third exile. With the exception
of §§30, 31, which were inserted at a later recension after the death of
Constantius (cf. *Hist. Ar.* 32 end), the work was all written in 359,
the year of the ‘dated’ creed (§4 <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxii.i-p4.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xxii.i-p4.2"></span>πὸ τῆς νῦν ὑπατείας</span>) and of the fateful
assemblies of Rimini and Seleucia. It was written moreover after the
latter council had broken up (Oct. 1), but before the news had reached
Athanasius of the Emperor’s chilling reception of the Ariminian
deputies, and of the protest of the bishops against their long detention
at that place. The documents connected with the last named episode
reached him only in time for his postscript (§55). Still less had he
heard of the melancholy surrender of the deputies of Ariminum at Niké on
Oct. 10, or of the final catastrophe (cf. the allusion in the inserted
§30, also *Prolegg.* ch. ii. §8 (2) *fin.*).

<span id="xxii.i-p5"></span>The first part only (see Table *infra*) of
the letter is devoted to the history <span
id="fr_3445"></span>[3446](#fn_3445.md) of the twin councils. Athanasius is
probably mistaken in ascribing the movement for a great council to the
Acacian or Homœan anxiety to eclipse and finally set aside the Council
of Nicæa. The Semi-Arians, who were ill at ease and anxious to
dissociate themselves from the growing danger of Anomœanism, and who at
this time had the ear of Constantius, were the persons who desired a
doctrinal settlement. It was the last effort of Eastern ‘Conservatism’
(yet see Gwatkin, *Studies,* p. 163) to formulate a position which
without admitting the obnoxious <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxii.i-p6.4"></span>ὁμοούσιον</span> should yet condemn Arianism,
conciliate the West, and restore peace to the Christian world. The
failure of the attempt, gloomy and ignominious as it was, was yet the
beginning of the end, the necessary precursor of the downfall of
Arianism as a power within the Church. The cause of this failure is to
be found in the intrigues of the Homœans, Valens in the West, Eudoxius
and Acacius in the East. Nicæa was chosen by Constantius for the *venue*
of the great Synod. But Basil, then in high favour, suggested Nicomedia,
and thither the bishops were summoned. Before they could meet, the city
was destroyed by an earthquake, and the *venue* was changed to Nicæa
again. Now the Homœans saw their opportunity. Their one chance of
escaping disaster was in the principle ‘divide et impera.’ The Council
was divided into two: the Westerns were to meet at Ariminum, the
Easterns at Seleucia in Cilicia, a place with nothing to recommend it
excepting the presence of a strong military force. Hence also the
conference of Homœan and Semi-Arian bishops at Sirmium, who drew up in
the presence of Constantius, on Whitsun-Eve, the famous ‘dated’ or
‘third Sirmian’ Creed. Its wording (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xxii.i-p6.5"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xxii.i-p6.6"></span>μοιου κατὰ πάντα</span>) shows the predominant
influence of the Semi-Arians, in spite of the efforts of Valens to get
rid of the test words, upon which the Emperor insisted. Basil moreover
issued a separate memorandum to explain the sense in which he signed the
creed, emphasising the absolute likeness of the Son to the Father
(Bright, *Introd.,* lxxxiii., Gwatkin, pp. 168 *sq.*), and accepting the
Nicene doctrine in everything but the name. But for all Basil might say,
the Dated Creed by the use of the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxii.i-p6.7"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xxii.i-p6.8"></span>μοιον</span> had opened the door to any evasion
that an Arian could desire: for <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxii.i-p6.9"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xxii.i-p6.10"></span>μοιον</span> is a relative term admitting of
degrees: what is only ‘like’ is *ipso facto* to some extent *un*like
(see below, §53). The party of Basil, then, entered upon the decisive
contest already outmanœuvred, and doomed to failure. The events which
followed are described by Athanasius (§§8–12). At Ariminum the Nicene,
at Seleucia the Semi-Arian cause carried all before it. The Dated Creed,
rejected with scorn at Ariminum, was unsuccessfully propounded in an
altered form by Acacius at Seleucia. The rupture between Homœans and
Semi-Arians was complete. So far only does Athanasius carry his account
of the Synods: at this point he steps in with a fresh blow at the link
which united Eastern Conservatism with the mixed multitude of original
Arians like Euzoius and Valens, ultra Arians like Aetius and <span
id="page_449">p. 449</span> <span id="xxii.i-Page_449"></span>Eunomius,
and Arianising opportunists like Acacius, Eudoxius, and their tribe. In
the latter he recognises deadly foes who are to be confuted and exposed
without any thought of compromise; in the former, brethren who
misunderstand their own position, and whom explanation will surely bring
round to their natural allies. In this twofold aim the *de Synodis*
stands in the lines of the great anti-Arian discourses (*supra,* p.
304). But with the eye of a general Athanasius suits his attack to the
new position. With the Arians, he has done with theological argument; he
points indignantly to their intrigues and their brow-beating, to their
lack of consistent principle, their endless synods and formularies
(§§21–32); concisely he exposes the hollowness of their objection to the
Nicene formula, the real logical basis upon which their position rests
(§33–40, see Bright, xc.–xcii.). But to the Semi-Arians he turns with a
serious and carefully stated vindication of the <span
class="Greek"><span id="xxii.i-p6.11"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xxii.i-p6.12"></span>μοούσιον</span>. The time
has come to press it earnestly upon them as the only adequate expression
of what they really mean, as the only rampart which can withstand the
Arian invasion. This, the last portion (§§41–54) of the letter, is the
*raison d’être* of the whole: the account of the Synods is merely a
means to this end, not his main purpose; the exposure of Arian
principles and of Arian variations subserves the ultimate aim of
detaching from them those of whom Athanasius was now hoping better
things. It may be said that he over-rated the hopefulness of affairs as
far as the immediate future was concerned. The weak acceptance by the
Seleucian majority (or rather by their delegates) of the Arian creed of
Niké, the triumph of Acacius, Eudoxius and their party as Constantius
drifted in the last two years of his life nearer and nearer to
ultra-Arianism (*de Syn.* 30, 31, his rupture with Basil, *Theodt.* ii.
27), the ascendancy of Arianism under Valens, and the eventual
consolidation of a Semi-Arian sect under the name of Macedonius, all
this at the first glance is a sad commentary upon the hopefulness of the
*de Synodis.* But (1) even if this were all the truth, Athanasius was
right: he was acting a noble part. In the *de Synodis* ‘even Athanasius
rises above himself.’ Driven to bay by the pertinacity of his enemies,
exasperated as we see him in the *de Fuga* and *Arian History,* ‘yet no
sooner is he cheered with the news of hope than the importunate
jealousies of forty years are hushed (contrast *Ep. Æg.* 7) in a moment,
as though the Lord had spoken peace to the tumult of the grey old
exile’s troubled soul’ (Gwatkin, *Studies,* p. 176, *Arian Controv.,* p.
98). The charity that hopeth all things is always justified of her
works. (2) Athanasius, however, was right in his estimate of the
position. Not only did many of the Semi-Arians (e.g. the fifty-nine in
365) accept the <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxii.i-p6.13"></span>ὁμοούσιον</span>, but it was from the ranks of
the Semi-Arians that the men arose who led the cause of Nicæa to its
ultimate victory in the East. There accompanied Basil of Ancyra from the
Seleucian Synod to Constantinople a young deacon and ascetic, who read
and welcomed the appeal of Athanasius. Writing a few months later, this
young theologian, Basil of Cæsarea, adopts the words of the *de
Synodis:* ‘one God we confess, one in nature not in number, for number
belongs to the category of quantity,…neither Like nor Unlike, for these
terms belong to the category of quality (cf. below, §53)…He that is
essentially God is Coessential with Him that is essentially God.…If I am
to state my own opinion, I accept “Like in essence” with the addition of
“exactly” as identical in sense with “Coessential”…but “exactly like”
\[without “essence”\] I suspect.…Accordingly since “Coessential” is the
term less open to abuse, on this ground I too adopt it’ (*Epp.* 8, 9,
the Greek in Gwatkin, *Studies,* p. 242) <span
id="fr_3446"></span>[3447](#fn_3446.md) . Basil the Great is, not indeed
the only, but the conspicuous and abundant justification of the insight
of Athanasius in the *de Synodis.*

<span id="xxii.i-p8"></span>Turning to subordinate parts of the Letter,
we may note the somewhat unfair use made of the unlucky blunder of the
Dated Creed, as though its compilers thereby admitted that their faith
had no earlier origin. The dating of the creed was doubtless ‘an offence
against good taste as well as ecclesiastical propriety’ (as sad a
blunder in its way as Macaulay’s celebrated letter to his constituents
from ‘Windsor Castle’), and it was only in human nature to make the most
of it. More serious is the objection taken to the revolting title <span
class="Greek"><span id="xxii.i-p8.1"></span>Αὐγούστου τοῦ αἰωνίου</span>
(which set a bad precedent for later times, Bright, lxxxiv, note 4) in
contrast to the denial of the eternity of the Son. At any rate, lending
itself as it did to such obvious criticisms, we are not surprised to
read (§29) that the copies of the creed were hastily called in and a
fresh recension substituted for it.

<span id="xxii.i-p9"></span>Lastly it must be remembered that Athanasius
does not aim at giving a complete catalogue of Arian or Arianising
creeds, any more than at giving a full history of the double council.
Accordingly we miss (1) the confession of Arius and Euzoius, presented
to Constantine in 330; (2) The confession ‘colourless in wording, but
heterodox in aim,’ drawn up at Sirmium <span
id="fr_3447"></span>[3448](#fn_3447.md) against Photinus in 347 (Hil.
*Fragm.* 2. 21 sq. Hefele, vol. i. p. 192); (3) The formulary propounded
by the Emperor at Milan in 355 (Hil. *Syn.* 78); (4) The confession of
the council of Ancyra <span id="fr_3448"></span>[3449](#fn_3448.md) , 358,
alluded to §41, see n. 9); (5) The Anomœan Ecthesis of Eudoxius and
Aetius, Constantinople 359 (Thdt. *H. E*. ii. 27).

<span id="xxii.i-p12"></span><span id="page_450">p. 450</span> <span
id="xxii.i-Page_450"></span>In the *de Synodis* we have a worthy
conclusion of the anti-Arian writings which are the legacy and the
record of the most stirring and eventful period of the noble life of our
great bishop.

<span id="xxii.i-p13"></span>The translation of this tract by Newman has
been more closely revised than those of the ‘de Decretis’ and the first
three ‘Discourses,’ as it appeared somewhat less exact in places. In
§§10, 11, the Athanasian version has been followed, as, inaccurate as
the version certainly is in places, this seemed more suitable to an
edition of Athanasius; moreover, it appears to preserve some more
original readings than the Hilarian text. The notes have been curtailed
to some extent, especially those containing purely historical matter.

ill-founded tradition that, ubiquitious and untiring in his exile, he

distant gatherings. (So Gibbon and, as far as Seleucia is concerned,
Tillemont. Montfaucon, as usual, takes the more sober and likely view.)
