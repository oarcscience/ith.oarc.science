id="xxv.iii.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Another Fragment <span
id="fr_4534"></span>[4535](#fn_4534.md) </span>.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xxiv-p3"></span>*Here begins a letter of S.
Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, to his children.* May God comfort you.
I know moreover that not only this thing saddens you, but also the fact
that while others have obtained the churches by violence, you are
meanwhile cast out from your places. For they hold the places, but you
the Apostolic Faith. They are, it is true, in the places, but outside of
the true Faith; while you are <span id="page_551">p. 551</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xxiv-Page_551"></span>outside the places indeed, but the
Faith, within you. Let us consider whether is the greater, the place or
the Faith. Clearly the true Faith. Who then has lost more, or who
possesses more? He who holds the place, or he who holds the Faith? Good
indeed is the place, when the Apostolic Faith is preached there, holy is
it if the Holy One dwell there. (*After a little:*) But ye are blessed,
who by faith are in the Church, dwell upon the foundations of the faith,
and have full satisfaction, even the highest degree of faith which
remains among you unshaken. For it has come down to you from Apostolic
tradition, and frequently has accursed envy wished to unsettle it, but
has not been able. On the contrary, they have rather been cut off by
their attempts to do so. For this is it that is written, ‘Thou art the
Son of the Living God <span id="fr_4535"></span>[4536](#fn_4535.md) ,’
Peter confessing it by revelation of the Father, and being told,
‘Blessed art thou Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood did not reveal it
to thee,’ but ‘My Father Who is in heaven,’ and the rest. No one
therefore will ever prevail against your Faith, most beloved brethren.
For if ever God shall give back the churches (for we think He will) yet
without <span id="fr_4536"></span>[4537](#fn_4536.md) such restoration of
the churches the Faith is sufficient for us. And lest, speaking without
the Scriptures, I should \[seem to\] speak too strongly, it is well to
bring you to the testimony of Scriptures, for recollect that the Temple
indeed was at Jerusalem; the Temple was not deserted, aliens had invaded
it, whence also the Temple being at Jerusalem, those exiles went down to
Babylon by the judgment of God, who was proving, or rather correcting
them; while manifesting to them in their ignorance punishment \[by
means\] of blood-thirsty enemies <span
id="fr_4537"></span>[4538](#fn_4537.md) . And aliens indeed had held the
Place, but knew not the Lord of the Place, while in that He neither gave
answer nor spoke, they were deserted by the truth. What profit then is
the Place to them?

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xxiv-p7"></span>For behold they that hold the
Place are charged by them that love God with making it a den of thieves,
and with madly making the Holy Place a house of merchandise, and a house
of judicial business for themselves to whom it was unlawful to enter
there. For this and worse than this is what we have heard, most beloved,
from those who are come from thence. However really, then, they seem to
hold the church, so much the more truly are they cast out. And they
think themselves to be within the truth, but are exiled, and in
captivity, and \[gain\] no advantage by the church alone. For the truth
of things is judged…

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xxiv-p2"></span> The following fragment (Migne,
*ib.* p. 1189), was published by Montfaucon from a Colbertine Latin
<span class="c10"><span id="xxv.iii.iii.xxiv-p2.2"></span>ms.</span> of
about 800 <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xxiv-p2.3"></span>a.d.</span> He conjectured that it
belonged to a Festal Letter. On this hypothesis, which is, however, as
Mai observes, by no means self-evident, we append it to the above
fragments of *Letter* 29, since internal evidence connects it with the
handing over of the churches at Alexandria to the partisans of George,
June, 356. At any rate, in spite of the heading of the fragment, its
beginning is clearly not preserved.
