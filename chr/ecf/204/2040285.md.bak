<span id="xviii.ii.xx-p1"></span> 20. *History of his disobeying it.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xx-p2"></span>Now I ask again, whence have my
accusers obtained this letter also? I would learn of them who it was
that put it into their hands? Do you cause them to answer. By this you
may perceive that they have forged this, as they spread abroad also the
former letter, which they published against me, with reference to the
ill-named Magnentius. And being convicted in this instance also, on what
pretence next will they bring me to make my defence? Their only concern
is, to throw everything into disorder and confusion; and for this end I
perceive they exercise their zeal. Perhaps they think that by frequent
repetition of their charges, they will at last exasperate you against
me. But you ought to turn away from such persons, and to hate them; for
such as themselves are, such also they imagine those to be who listen to
them; and they think that their calumnies will prevail even before you.
The accusation of Doeg <span id="fr_1344"></span>[1345](#fn_1344.md)
prevailed of old against the priests of God: but it was the unrighteous
Saul, who hearkened unto him. And Jezebel was able to injure the most
religious Naboth <span id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345.md) by her false
accusations; but then it was the wicked and apostate Ahab who hearkened
unto her. But the most holy David, whose example it becomes you to
follow, as all pray that you may, favours not such men, but was wont to
turn away from them and avoid them, as raging dogs. He says, ‘Whoso
privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I destroy <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346.md) .’ For he kept the commandment
which says, ‘Thou shalt not receive a false report <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347.md) .’ And false are the reports of
these men in your sight. You, like Solomon, have required of the Lord
(and you ought to believe yourself to have obtained your desire), that
it would seem good unto Him to remove far from you vain and lying
words <span id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md) .
