<span id="xviii.ii.xxv-p1"></span> 25. *The irruption of Syrianus.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xxv-p2"></span>All demanded that the letters of your
Piety should be exhibited. For although the bare word of a King is of
equal weight and authority with his written command, especially if he
who reports it, boldly affirms in writing that it has been given him;
yet when they neither openly declared that they had received any
command, nor, as they were requested to do, gave me assurance of it in
writing, but acted altogether as by their own authority; I confess, I
say it boldly, I was suspicious of them. For there were many Arians
about them, who were their companions at table, and their counsellors;
and while they attempted nothing openly, they were preparing to assail
me by stratagem and treachery. Nor did they act at all as under the
authority of a royal command, but, as their conduct betrayed, at the
solicitation of enemies. This made me demand more urgently that they
should produce letters from you, seeing that all their undertakings and
designs were of a suspicious nature; and because it was unseemly that
after I had entered the Church, under the authority of so many letters
from you, I should retire from it without such a sanction. When however
Syrianus gave his promise, all the people assembled together in the
Churches with feelings of joyfulness and security. But three and twenty
days after <span id="fr_1356"></span>[1357](#fn_1356.md) , he burst into
the Church with his soldiers, while we were engaged in our usual
services, as those who entered in there witnessed; for it was a vigil,
preparatory to a communion on the morrow. And such things were done that
night as the Arians desired and had beforehand denounced against us. For
the <span id="page_248">p. 248</span> <span
id="xviii.ii.xxv-Page_248"></span>General brought them with him; and
they were the instigators and advisers of the attack. This is no
incredible story of mine, most religious Augustus; for it was not done
in secret, but was noised abroad everywhere. When therefore I saw the
assault begun, I first exhorted the people to retire, and then withdrew
myself after them, God hiding and guiding me, as those who were with me
at the time witness. Since then, I have remained by myself, though I
have all confidence to answer for my conduct, in the first place before
God, and also before your Piety, for that I did not flee and desert my
people, but can point to the attack of the General upon us, as a proof
of persecution. His proceedings have caused the greatest astonishment
among all men; for either he ought not to have made a promise, or not to
have broken it after he had made it.
