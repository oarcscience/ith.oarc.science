Lucifer <span id="fr_4632"></span>[4633](#fn_4632.md) .*

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.v-p3"></span>To our lord, and most beloved brother
the Bishop and Confessor Lucifer. Athanasius greeting in the Lord.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.v-p4"></span>Being well in body by God’s favour, we
have now sent our most beloved deacon Eutyches, that your most pious
holiness, as is much desired by us, may be pleased to inform us of the
safety of yourself and those with you. For we believe it is by the life
of you Confessors and servants of God that the state of the Catholic
Church is renewed; and that what heretics have assayed to rend in
pieces, our Lord Jesus Christ by your means restores whole.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.v-p5"></span>For although the forerunners of
Antichrist have by the power of this world done everything to put out
the lantern of truth, yet the Deity by your confession shews its light
all the clearer, so that none can fail to see their deceit. Heretofore
perhaps they were able to dissimulate: now they are called Antichrists.
For who can but execrate them, and fly from their communion like a
taint, or the poison of a serpent? The whole Church everywhere is
mourning, every city groans, aged bishops are suffering in exile, and
heretics dissembling, who while denying Christ have made themselves
publicans, sitting in the Churches and exacting revenue <span
id="fr_4633"></span>[4634](#fn_4633.md) . O new kind of men and of
persecution which the devil has devised, namely to use such cruelty, and
even ministers as the agents of evil. But although they act thus, and
have gone all lengths in pride and blasphemy, yet your confession, your
piety and wisdom, will be the very greatest comfort and solace to the
brotherhood. For it has been reported to us that your holiness has
written to Constantius Augustus; and we wonder more and more that
dwelling as it were among scorpions you yet preserve freedom of spirit,
in order, by advice or teaching or correction, to bring those in error
to the light of truth. I ask then, and all confessors join me in asking,
that you will be good enough to send us a copy; so that all may
perceive, not by hearsay only but by letters, the valour of your spirit,
and the confidence and firmness of your faith. Those who are with me
salute your holiness. I salute all those who are with you. May the deity
ever keep you safe and sound and mindful of us, most beloved lord, and
true man of God.

Lucifer sent the books which he had addressed to Constantius; and when
he had read them Athanasius sent the following letter:*

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.v-p2"></span> Lucifer, bishop of Calaris (Cagliari)
in Sardinia, exiled by Constantius after the Council of Milan (Prolegg.
ch. ii. §7), first to Germanicia, then to Eleutheropolis in Palestine,
at both of which places he was subjected to harsh treatment, lastly to
the Thebaid. The violence of his advocacy of the Nicene faith, coupled
with extreme personal abusiveness, may have aggravated his sufferings.
On his part in the events of 362, see Prolegg. ch. ii. §9. The present
letters exist only in Latin (Migne xxvi. 1181), and are probably a
translation from the Greek. Athan. may have known Latin, but there is no
evidence that he ever wrote in that language. The play on the name
Lucifer in *Letter* 51 proves nothing to the contrary. Dr. Bright (in
D.C.B. i. 198, note) expresses a doubt as to the genuineness of our
letters which is I think unsupported by internal evidence. The main
difficulty is in the reconciliation of the apparent references (51
init.) to the events of 356 as recent with the clear references to the
*de Athanasio* and *Moriendum pro Filio Dei* of Lucifer, neither of
which works were penned before 358, while the latter in its final form
mentions the translation of Eudoxius to CP., and therefore falls as late
as 360 (for proof of this, see Krüger, *Lucifer,* pp. 102–109). But on
close examination, the language of *Letter* 51 is satisfied by the
events of 359, the vindictive commission of Paul Catena and the search
for Athanasius among the Monasteries (cf. *Letter* 53, note 1). The
respectful reference to Constantius in *Letter* 50 is of a purely formal
character. The reference to the parents of Athanasius as still living is
of great interest as one of the very few notices of the family of the
great bishop (Prolegg. ch. ii. §1). The agitated tone of the Epistles
reminds us of the *Arian History,* and they may be set down to about the
year 359. On Lucifer, the monograph of Krüger is the standard authority.
