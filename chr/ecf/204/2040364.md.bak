class="c10"><span id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-p1.2"></span>Introduction to</span>
<span id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-p1.3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-p1.4"></span>[Proverbs viii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-p1.5"></span></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-p1.6"></span>continued</span>. *Absurdity of supposing
a Son or Word created in order to the creation of other creatures; as to
the creation being unable to bear God’s immediate hand, God condescends
to the lowest. Moreover, if the Son a creature, He too could not bear
God’s hand, and an infinite series of media will be necessary. Objected,
that, as Moses who led out the Israelites was a man, so our Lord; but
Moses was not the Agent in creation:—again, that unity is found in
created ministrations, but all such ministrations are defective and
dependent:—again, that He learned to create, yet could God’s Wisdom need
teaching? and why should He learn, if the Father worketh hitherto? If
the Son was created to create us, He is for our sake, not we for His.*

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-p2"></span>24 (*continued*). <span
class="c10"><span id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-p2.1"></span>And</span> here it were
well to ask them also this question <span
id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359.md) , for a still clearer refutation of
their heresy;—Wherefore, when all things are creatures, and all are
brought into consistence from nothing, and the Son Himself, according to
you, is creature and work, and once was not, wherefore has He made ‘all
things through Him’ alone, ‘and without Him was made not one thing <span
id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360.md) ?’ or why is it, when ‘all things’
are spoken of, that no one thinks the Son is signified in the number,
but only things originate; whereas when Scripture speaks of the Word, it
does not understand Him as being in the number of ‘all,’ but places Him
with the Father, as Him in whom Providence and salvation for ‘all’ are
wrought and effected by the Father, though all things surely might at
the same command have come to be, at which He was brought into being by
God alone? For God is not wearied by commanding <span
id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361.md) , nor is His strength unequal to
the making of all things, that He should alone create the only Son <span
id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362.md) , and need His ministry and aid for
the framing of the rest. For He lets nothing stand over, which He wills
to be done; but He willed only <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363.md) , and all things subsisted, and no
one ‘hath resisted His will <span id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364.md)
.’ Why then were not all things brought into being by God alone at that
same command, at which the Son came into being? Or let them tell us, why
did all things through Him come to be, who was Himself but originate?
How void of reason! however, they say concerning Him, that ‘God willing
to create originate nature, when He saw that it could not endure the
untempered hand of the Father, and to be created by Him, makes and
creates first and alone one only, and calls Him Son and Word, that,
through Him as a medium, all things might thereupon be brought to
be <span id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365.md) .’ This they not only have
said, but they have dared to put it into writing, namely, Eusebius,
Arius, and Asterius who sacrificed <span
id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md) .

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-p11"></span>25. Is not this a full proof of that
irreligion, <span id="page_362">p. 362</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-Page_362"></span>with which they have drugged
themselves with much madness, till they blush not to be intoxicate
against the truth? For if they shall assign the toil of making all
things as the reason why God made the Son only, the whole creation will
cry out against them as saying unworthy things of God; and Isaiah too
who has said in Scripture, ‘The Everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator
of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary: there is no
searching of His understanding <span
id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) .’ And if God made the Son alone,
as not deigning to make the rest, but committed them to the Son as an
assistant, this on the other hand is unworthy of God, for in Him there
is no pride. Nay the Lord reproves the thought, when He says, ‘Are not
two sparrows sold for a farthing?’ and ‘one of them shall not fall on
the ground without your Father which is in heaven.’ And again, ‘Take no
thought for your life, what ye shall eat, nor yet for your body, what ye
shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor
gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them; are ye not
much better than they? Which of you by taking thought, can add one cubit
unto his stature? And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the
lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed like one of these. Wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the
field which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall He not
much more clothe you, O ye of little faith <span
id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368.md) ?’ If then it be not unworthy of
God to exercise His Providence, even down to things so small, a hair of
the head, and a sparrow, and the grass of the field, also it was not
unworthy of Him to make them. For what things are the subjects of His
Providence, of those He is Maker through His proper Word. Nay a worse
absurdity lies before the men who thus speak; for they distinguish <span
id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369.md) between the creatures and the
framing; and consider the latter the work of the Father, the creatures
the work of the Son; whereas either all things must be brought to be by
the Father with the Son, or if all that is originate comes to be through
the Son, we must not call Him one of the originated things.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-p15"></span>26. Next, their folly may be exposed
thus:—if even the Word be of originated nature, how, whereas this nature
is too feeble to be God’s own handywork, could He alone of all endure to
be made by the unoriginate and unmitigated Essence of God, as ye say?
for it follows either that, if He could endure it, all could endure it,
or, it being endurable by none, it was not endurable by the Word, for
you say that He is one of originate things. And again, if because
originate nature could not endure to be God’s own handywork, there arose
need of a mediator <span id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370.md) , it must
follow, that, the Word being originate and a creature, there is need of
medium in His framing also, since He too is of that originate nature
which endures not to be made of God, but needs a medium. But if some
being as a medium be found for Him, then again a fresh mediator is
needed for that second, and thus tracing back and following out, we
shall invent a vast crowd of accumulating mediators; and thus it will be
impossible that the creation should subsist, as ever wanting a mediator,
and that medium not coming into being without another mediator; for all
of them will be of that originate nature which endures not to be made of
God alone, as ye say. How abundant is that folly, which obliges them to
hold that what has already come into being, admits not of coming! Or
perhaps they opine that they have not even come to be, as still seeking
their mediator; for, on the ground of their so irreligious and futile
notion <span id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371.md) , what is would not
have subsistence, for want of the medium.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-p18"></span>27. But again they allege
this:—‘Behold, through Moses too did He lead the people from Egypt, and
through him He gave the Law, yet he was a man; so that it is possible
for like to be brought into being by like.’ They should veil their face
when they say this, to save their much shame. For Moses was not sent to
frame the world, nor to call into being things which were not, or to
fashion men like himself, but only to be the minister of words to the
people, and to King Pharaoh. And this is a very different thing, for to
minister is of things originate as of servants, but to frame and to
create is of God alone, and of His proper Word and His Wisdom.
Wherefore, in the matter of framing, we shall find none but God’s Word;
for ‘all things are made in Wisdom,’ and ‘without the Word was made not
one thing.’ But as regards ministrations there are, not one only, but
man out of their whole number, whomever the Lord will send. For there
are many Archangels, many Thrones, and Authorities, and Dominions,
thousands of thousands, and myriads of myriads, standing before
Him <span id="fr_2372"></span>[2373](#fn_2372.md) , minis<span
id="page_363">p. 363</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-Page_363"></span>tering and ready to be sent. And many
Prophets, and twelve Apostles, and Paul. And Moses himself was not
alone, but Aaron with him, and next other seventy were filled with the
Holy Ghost. And Moses was succeeded by Joshua the son of Nun, and he by
the Judges, and they not by one, but by a number of Kings. If then the
Son were a creature and one of things originate, there must have been
many such sons, that God might have many such ministers, just as there
is a multitude of those others. But if this is not to be seen, but while
the creatures are many, the Word is one, any one will collect from this,
that the Son differs from all, and is not on a level with the creatures,
but proper to the Father. Hence there are not many Words, but one only
Word of the one Father, and one Image of the one God <span
id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373.md) . ‘But behold,’ they say, ‘there is
one sun only <span id="fr_2374"></span>[2375](#fn_2374.md) , and one
earth.’ Let them maintain, senseless as they are, that there is one
water and one fire, and then they may be told that everything that is
brought to be, is one in its own essence; but for the ministry and
service committed to it, by itself it is not adequate nor sufficient
alone. For God said, ‘Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven, to
give light upon the earth and to divide the day from the night; and let
them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years.’ And then he
says, ‘And God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night: He made the stars also. And God
set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth,
and to rule over the day and over the night <span
id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375.md) .’

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-p23"></span>28. Behold there are many lights,
and not the sun only, nor the moon only, but each is one in essence, and
yet the service of all is one and common; and what each lacks, is
supplied by the other, and the office of lighting is performed by
all <span id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376.md) . Thus the sun has
authority to shine throughout the day and no more; and the moon through
the night; and the stars together with them accomplish the seasons and
years, and become for signs, each according to the need that calls for
it. Thus too the earth is not for all things, but for the fruits only,
and to be a ground to tread on for the living things that inhabit it.
And the firmament is to divide between waters and waters, and to be a
place to set the stars in. So also fire and water, with other things,
have been brought into being to be the constituent parts of bodies; and
in short no one thing is alone, but all things that are made, as if
members of each other, make up as it were one body, namely, the world.
If then they thus conceive of the Son, let all men throw stones <span
id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377.md) at them, considering the Word to be
a part of this universe, and a part insufficient without the rest for
the service committed to Him. But if this be manifestly irreligious, let
them acknowledge that the Word is not in the number of things originate,
but the sole and proper Word of the Father, and their Framer. ‘But,’ say
they, ‘though He is a creature and of things originate; yet as from a
master and artificer has He <span id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378.md)
learned to frame, and thus ministered <span
id="fr_2379"></span>[2380](#fn_2379.md) to God who taught Him.’ For thus
the Sophist Asterius, on the strength of having learned to deny the
Lord, has dared to write, not observing the absurdity which follows. For
if framing be a thing to be taught, let them beware lest they say that
God Himself be a Framer not by nature but by science, so as to admit of
His losing the power. Besides, if the Wisdom of God attained to frame by
teaching, how is He still Wisdom, when He needs to learn? and what was
He before He learned? For it was not Wisdom, if it needed teaching; it
was surely but some empty thing, and not essential Wisdom <span
id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380.md) , but from advancement it had the
name of Wisdom, and will be only so long Wisdom as it can keep what it
has learned. For what has accrued not by any nature, but from learning,
admits of being one time unlearned. But to speak thus of the Word of
God, is not the part of Christians but of Greeks.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-p29"></span>29. For if the power of framing
accrues to anyone from teaching, these insensate men are ascribing
jealousy and weakness <span id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381.md) to
God;—jealousy, in that He has not taught many how to frame, so that
there may be around Him, as Archangels and Angels many, so framers many;
and weakness, in that He could not make by Himself, but needed a
fellow-worker, or under-worker; and that, though it has been already
shewn that created nature admits of being made by God alone, since they
consider the Son to be of such a nature and so made. But God is
deficient in nothing: perish the thought! for He has said Himself, ‘I am
full <span id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382.md) .’ Nor did the Word
become Framer of all from teaching; but being the Image and Wisdom of
the Father, He does the things of the Father. Nor hath He made the Son
for the making of things created; for behold, though the Son exists,
still <span id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383.md) the Father is seen to
work, as the Lord Himself says, ‘My Father worketh hitherto and I
work <span id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384.md) .’ If <span
id="page_364">p. 364</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-Page_364"></span>however, as you say, the Son came
into being for the purpose of making the things after Him, and yet the
Father is seen to work even after the Son, you must hold even in this
light the making of such a Son to be superfluous. Besides, why, when He
would create us, does He seek for a mediator at all, as if His will did
not suffice to constitute whatever seemed good to Him? Yet the
Scriptures say, ‘He hath done whatsoever pleased Him <span
id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385.md) ,’ and ‘Who hath resisted His
will <span id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386.md) ?’ And if His mere
will <span id="fr_2387"></span>[2388](#fn_2387.md) is sufficient for the
framing of all things, you make the office of a mediator superfluous;
for your instance of Moses, and the sun and the moon has been shewn not
to hold. And here again is an argument to silence you. You say that God,
willing the creation of originated nature, and deliberating concerning
it, designs and creates the Son, that through Him He may frame us; now,
if so, consider how great an irreligion <span
id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388.md) you have dared to utter.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.iv-p38"></span>30. First, the Son appears rather to
have been for us brought to be, than we for Him; for we were not created
for Him, but He is made for us <span
id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389.md) ; so that He owes thanks to us, not
we to Him, as the woman to the man. ‘For the man,’ says Scripture, ‘was
not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.’ Therefore, as
‘the man is the image and glory of God, and the woman the glory of the
man <span id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390.md) ,’ so we are made God’s
image and to His glory; but the Son is our image, and exists for our
glory. And we were brought into being that we might be; but God’s Word
was made, as you must hold, not that He might be <span
id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391.md) ; but as an instrument <span
id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392.md) for our need, so that not we from
Him, but He is constituted from our need. Are not men who even conceive
such thoughts, more than insensate? For if for us the Word was made, He
has not precedence <span id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393.md) of us with
God; for He did not take counsel about us having Him within Him, but
having us in Himself, counselled, as they say, concerning His own Word.
But if so, perchance the Father had not even a will for the Son at all;
for not as having a will for Him, did He create Him, but with a will for
us, He formed Him for our sake; for He designed Him after designing us;
so that, according to these irreligious men, henceforth the Son, who was
made as an instrument, is superfluous, now that they are made for whom
He was created. But if the Son alone was made by God alone, because He
could endure it, but we, because we could not, were made by the Word,
why does He not first take counsel about the Word, who could endure His
making, instead of taking counsel about us? or why does He not make more
of Him who was strong, than of us who were weak? or why making Him
first, does He not counsel about Him first? or why counselling about us
first, does He not make us first, His will being sufficient for the
constitution of all things? But He creates Him first, yet counsels first
about us; and He wills us before the Mediator; and when He wills to
create us, and counsels about us, He calls us creatures; but Him, whom
He frames for us, He calls Son and proper Heir. But we, for whose sake
He made Him, ought rather to be called sons; or certainly He, who is His
Son, is rather the object of His previous thoughts and of His will, for
whom He makes all us. Such the sickness, such the vomit <span
id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394.md) of the heretics.

[Next: Introduction to Proverbs viii. 22 continued. Contrast between the
Father's operations immediately and naturally in the Son, instrumentally
by the creatures; Scripture terms illustrative of this. Explanation of
these illustrations; which should be interpreted by the doctrine of the
Church; perverse sense put on them by the Arians, refuted. Mystery of
Divine Generation. Contrast between God's Word and man's word drawn out
at length. Asterius betrayed into holding two Unoriginates; his
inconsistency. Baptism how by the Son as well as by the Father. On the
Baptism of heretics. Why Arian worse than other heresies.](2040365.md)
