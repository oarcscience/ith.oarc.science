<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>An</span> Index of the months of each year,
and of the days, and of the Indictions, and of the Consulates, and of
the Governors in Alexandria, and of all the Epacts, and of those
\[days\] which are named ‘of the Gods <span
id="fr_3822"></span>[3823](#fn_3822.md) ,’ and the reason \[any Letter\]
was not sent, and the returns from exile <span
id="fr_3823"></span>[3824](#fn_3823.md) —from the Festal Letters of Pope
Athanasius.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p5"></span>The Festal Letters of Athanasius, Bishop
of Alexandria, which he sent year by year, to the several cities and all
the provinces subject to him; that is, from Pentapolis, and on to Libya,
Ammoniaca, the greater and the lesser Oasis, Egypt, and Augustamnica,
with the Heptanomis of <span id="fr_3824"></span>[3825](#fn_3824.md) the
upper and middle Thebais; \[commencing\] from the 44th <span
id="fr_3825"></span>[3826](#fn_3825.md) year of the Diocletian Era, in
which the Paschal Festival was on xvi <span
id="fr_3826"></span>[3827](#fn_3826.md) Pharmuthi; xviii Kal. Mai; xviii
Moon; when Alexander, his predecessor, having departed this life on xxii
Pharmuthi <span id="fr_3827"></span>[3828](#fn_3827.md) , he \[Athan.\]
succeeded him after the Paschal festival on xiv Pauni, Indict. i,
Januarius and Justus being Consuls, the governor Zenius of Italy being
the Præfect of Egypt, Epact xxv; Gods, i.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p10"></span>I. (Aug. 29, 328, to Aug. 28, <span
class="c10"><span id="xxv.iii.ii-p10.1"></span>a.d.</span> 329.) In this
year, Easter-day was on xi Pharmuthi; viii. Id. Ap.; xxii Moon; Coss.
Constantinus Aug. viii, Constantinus Cæs. IV; the same governor Zenius
being Præfect of Egypt; Indict. ii; Epact vi; Gods, ii. This was the
first Letter he \[Athan.\] sent; for he was ordained Bishop in the
preceding year after the Paschal feast, Alexander, as is known, having
despatched one for that year, before he was released from life. This was
in the 45th of the Diocletian era.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p11"></span>II. (329–330.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xxiv Pharmuthi; xiii Kal. Mai; xv Moon; Coss. Gallicianus,
Symmachus; the governor Magninianus the Cappadocian being Præfect of
Egypt; Indict. iii; Epact xvii; Gods, iii. In this year he went through
the Thebais.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p12"></span>III. (330–331.) In this year,
Easter-day was on xvi Pharmuthi; xviii Moon; iii Id. Ap.; Coss. Annius
Bassus, Ablavius; the governor Hyginus <span
id="fr_3828"></span>[3829](#fn_3828.md) of Italy, Præfect of Egypt; Epact
xxviii; Indict. iv. He sent this Letter while journeying on his return
from the Imperial Court. For in this year he went to the Imperial Court
to the Emperor Constantine the Great, having been summoned before him,
on account of an accusation his enemies made, that he had been appointed
when too young. He appeared, was thought worthy of favour and honour,
and returned <span id="fr_3829"></span>[3830](#fn_3829.md) when the fast
was half finished.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p15"></span>IV. (331–332.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xvii <span id="fr_3830"></span>[3831](#fn_3830.md) Pharmuthi; xx
Moon; iv Non. Apr.; Epact ix; Gods, vi; Coss. Pacatianus, Hilarianus;
the same governor Hyginus, Præfect of Egypt; Indict. v. In this year he
went through Pentapolis, and was in Ammoniaca.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p17"></span>V. (332–333.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xx Pharmuthi; xv Moon; xvii Kal. Mai; Epact xx; Gods, vii; Coss.
Dalmatius, Zenophilus; the governor Paternus <span
id="fr_3831"></span>[3832](#fn_3831.md) , Præfect of Egypt; Indict. vi.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p19"></span>VI. (333–334.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xii Pharmuthi; xvii Moon; vii Id. Apr.; Indict. vii; Epact i;
Gods, i; Coss. Optatus, Paulinus; the same governor Paternus <span
id="fr_3832"></span>[3833](#fn_3832.md) Præfect of Egypt. In this year he
went through the lower country. In it he was summoned to a Synod, his
enemies having previously devised mischief against him in Cæsarea of
Palestine; but becoming aware of the conspiracy, he excused himself from
attending.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p21"></span>VII. (334–335.) In this year,
Easter-day was on xiv <span id="fr_3833"></span>[3834](#fn_3833.md)
Pharmuthi; xx Moon; iii Kal. Ap.; Indict. viii; Epact xii; Gods, ii;
Coss. Constantius <span id="fr_3834"></span>[3835](#fn_3834.md) , Albinus;
the same governor Paternus, Præfect of Egypt.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p24"></span>VIII. (335–336.) In this year,
Easter-day was on xxiii Pharmuthi, xx Moon; xiv Kal. Mai; Indict. ix;
Epact xxiii; Gods, iv; Coss. Nepotianus, Facundus; the governor
Philagrius, the Cappadocian, Præfect of Egypt. In this year he went to
that Synod of his enemies which was assembled at Tyre. Now he journeyed
from this place on xvii Epiphi <span
id="fr_3835"></span>[3836](#fn_3835.md) , but when a discovery was made of
the plot against him, he removed thence and fled in an open boat to
Constantinople. Arriving there on ii Athyr <span
id="fr_3836"></span>[3837](#fn_3836.md) , after eight days he presented
himself before the Emperor Constantine, and spoke plainly. But his
enemies, by various secret devices, influenced the Emperor, who suddenly
condemned him to exile, and he set out on the tenth of Athyr <span
id="fr_3837"></span>[3838](#fn_3837.md) to Gaul, to Constans Cæsar, the son
of Augustus. On this account he wrote no Festal Letter.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p28"></span>IX. (336–7.) In this year, Easter-day
was on viii Pharmuthi; xvi Moon; iv <span
id="fr_3838"></span>[3839](#fn_3838.md) Non. Ap.; Indict. x; Epact iv;
Gods, v; Coss. Felicianus, Titianus; the governor Philagrius, the
Cappadocian, Præfect of Egypt. He was in Treviri of Gaul, and on this
account was unable to write a Festal Letter.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p30"></span>X. (337–8.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xxx Phamenoth; vii Kal. Ap.; xix <span
id="fr_3839"></span>[3840](#fn_3839.md) Moon, Indict. xi; Epact xv; Gods,
vi; Coss. Ursus, Polemius; the governor Theodorus <span
id="fr_3840"></span>[3841](#fn_3840.md) , of Heliopolis, Præfect of Egypt.
In this year, Constantine having died on xxvii Pachon <span
id="fr_3841"></span>[3842](#fn_3841.md) , Athanasius, now liberated,
returned from Gaul triumphantly on xxvii <span
id="fr_3842"></span>[3843](#fn_3842.md) Athyr. In this year, too, there
were many events. Antony, the great leader, came to Alexandria, and
though he remained there only two days, shewed himself wonderful in many
things, and healed many. He went away on the third of Messori. <span
id="fr_3843"></span>[3844](#fn_3843.md)

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p36"></span>XI. (338–9.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xx Pharmuthi; xx Moon; xvii Kal. Mai; Epact xxvi; Gods, vii;
Indict. xii; Coss. Constantius II, Constans I <span
id="fr_3844"></span>[3845](#fn_3844.md) ; the governor Philagrius, the
Cappadocian, Præfect of Egypt. In this year, again, there were many
tumults. On the xxii Phamenoth <span
id="fr_3845"></span>[3846](#fn_3845.md) he was pursued in the night, and
the next day he fled from the Church of Theonas, after he had baptized
many. Then, four days after, Gregorius the Cappadocian entered the city
as Bishop.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p39"></span>XII. (339–340.) In this year,
Easter-day was on xiv <span id="fr_3846"></span>[3847](#fn_3846.md)
Pharmuthi; xv Moon; iii Kal. Ap.; Epact vii; Gods, ii; Indict. xiii;
Coss. Acyndinus, Proclus; the same governor Philagrius, Præfect of
Egypt. Gregorius continued his acts of violence, and therefore \[Ath.\]
wrote no Festal Letter. The Arians proclaimed \[Easter\] on xxvii
Phamenoth, and were much ridiculed on account of this error. Then
altering it in the middle of the fast, they kept it with us on iv <span
id="fr_3847"></span>[3848](#fn_3847.md) Pharmuthi, as above. He
\[Athanasius\] gave notice of it to the presbyters of Alexandria in a
short note, not being able to send a letter as usual, on account of his
flight and the treachery.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p42"></span>XIII. (340–341.) In this year,
Easter-day was on xxiv Pharmuthi; xvi Moon; xiii. Kal. Mai; Epact xviii;
<span id="page_504">p. 504</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.ii-Page_504"></span>Gods, iii; Indict. xiv; Coss.
Marcellinus, Probinus; the governor Longinus, of Nicæa, Præfect of
Egypt. Augustamnica was separated. <span
id="fr_3848"></span>[3849](#fn_3848.md) On account of Gregorius continuing
in the city, and exercising violence, although this illness commenced,
the Pope did not write a Festal Letter even this time <span
id="fr_3849"></span>[3850](#fn_3849.md) .

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p45"></span>XIV. (341–2.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xvi Pharmuthi; xx <span id="fr_3850"></span>[3851](#fn_3850.md)
Moon; iii Id. Ap.; Epact xxix; Gods, iv; Indict. xv; Coss. Constantius
III, Constans II; the governor Longinus of Nicæa, Præfect of Egypt.
Because Gregorius was in the city, \[though\] severely ill, the Pope was
unable to send \[any Letter\].

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p47"></span>XV. (342–3.) In this year, Easter-day
was on i Pharmuthi; xv Moon; vi Kal. Ap.; Epact xi; Gods, v; Indict. i;
Coss. Placidus, Romulus; the same governor Longinus, of Nicæa, Præfect
of Egypt. In this year the Synod of Sardica was held <span
id="fr_3851"></span>[3852](#fn_3851.md) ; and when the Arians had arrived,
they returned to Philippopolis, for Philagrius gave them this advice
there. In truth, they were blamed everywhere, and were even
anathematised by the Church of Rome, and having written a recantation to
Pope Athanasius, Ursacius and Valens were put to shame. There was an
agreement made at Sardica respecting Easter, and a decree was issued to
be binding for fifty years, which the Romans and Alexandrians everywhere
announced in the usual manner. Again he \[Athan.\] wrote a Festal
Letter.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p49"></span>XVI. (343–4.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xx Pharmuthi; xix Moon; xvii Kal. Mai; Epact xxi; Gods, vi\[i\],
Coss. Leontius, Sallustius; the governor Palladius, of Italy, Præfect of
Egypt; Indict. ii. Being at Naissus on his return from the Synod, he
there celebrated Easter <span id="fr_3852"></span>[3853](#fn_3852.md) . Of
this Easter-day he gave notice in few words to the presbyters of
Alexandria, but he was unable to do so to the country.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p51"></span>XVII. (344–5.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xii Pharmuthi; xviii Moon; vii. Id. Ap.; Epact ii; Gods, i;
Indict. iii; Coss. Amantius, Albinus; the governor Nestorius of Gaza,
Præfect of Egypt. Having travelled to Aquileia, he kept Easter there. Of
this Easter-day, he gave notice in few words to the presbyters of
Alexandria, but not to the country.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p52"></span>XVIII. (345–6.) In this year,
Easter-day was on iv Pharmuthi; xxi <span
id="fr_3853"></span>[3854](#fn_3853.md) Moon; iii Kal. Ap.; Epact xiv;
Gods, ii; Indict. iv; Coss. Constantius <span
id="fr_3854"></span>[3855](#fn_3854.md) Aug. IV, Constans Aug. III; the
same governor Nestorius of Gaza, Præfect of Egypt. Gregorius having died
on the second of Epiphi <span id="fr_3855"></span>[3856](#fn_3855.md) , he
returned from Rome and Italy, and entered the city and the Church.
Moreover he was thought worthy of a grand reception, for on the xxiv
Paophi <span id="fr_3856"></span>[3857](#fn_3856.md) , the people and all
those in authority met him a hundred miles distant, and he continued in
honour. He had already sent the Festal Letter for this year, in few
words, to the presbyters.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p57"></span>XIX. (346–7.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xvii Pharmuthi xv. Moon; Prid. Id. Apr.; Epact xxv; Gods, iii;
Indict. v; Coss. Rufinus, Eusebius; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza,
Præfect of Egypt. He wrote this Letter while residing here in
Alexandria, giving notice of some things which he had not been able to
do before.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p58"></span>XX. (347–8.) In this year, Easter-day
was on vii Pharmuthi; xviii Moon; iii Non. Ap.; Epact vi; Gods, v <span
id="fr_3857"></span>[3858](#fn_3857.md) Indict. vi; Coss. Philippus, Salia;
the same governor Nestorius of Gaza, Præfect of Egypt. This Letter also
he sent while residing in Alexandria.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p60"></span>XXI. (348–9.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xxx Phamenoth;…xix Moon,…vii Kal. Ap.; Epact xvii; Gods, vi;
Indict. vii. But because the Romans refused, for they said they held a
tradition from the Apostle Peter not to pass the twenty-sixth day of
Pharmuthi, nor..the thirtieth of Phamenoth, xxi Moon,……………… <span
id="fr_3858"></span>[3859](#fn_3858.md) , vii Kal. Ap.; Coss. Limenius,
Catullinus; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza, Præfect of Egypt. He
sent this also while residing in Alexandria.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p62"></span>XXII. (349–50.) In this year,
Easter-day was on xiii Pharmuthi; xix Moon, the second hour; vi Id. Ap.;
Epact xxviii; Gods, vii; Indict. viii; Coss. Sergius, Nigrianus; the
same governor Nestorius of Gaza, Præfect of Egypt. In this year,
Constans was slain by Magnentius, and Constantius held the empire alone;
then he wrote to the Pope \[Athan.\], telling him to fear nothing
because of the death of Constans, but to confide in him as he had done
in Constans while living.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p63"></span>XXIII. (350–1.) In this year, Easter
day was on v Pharmuthi; Moon xviii; Prid. Kal. Ap.; Epact ix; Gods, i;
Indict. ix; the Consulship after that of Sergius and Nigrianus; the same
governor Nestorius of Gaza, again Præfect of Egypt.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p64"></span>XXIV. (351–2.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xxiv Pharmuthi; xviii Moon; xiii Kal. Mai, Epact xx; Gods, iii;
Indict. x, Coss. Constantius Aug. V, Constantius Cæsar I; the same
governor Nestorius of Gaza, Præfect of Egypt. Gallus was proclaimed
Cæsar <span id="fr_3859"></span>[3860](#fn_3859.md) , and his name changed
into Constantius.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p66"></span>XXV. (352–3.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xvi Pharmuthi; xxi Moon; iii Id. Ap.; Epact i; Gods, iv; Indict.
xi; Coss. Constantius Aug. VI, Constantius Cæsar II; the governor
Sebastianus of Thrace, præfect of Egypt. In this year, Serapion <span
id="fr_3860"></span>[3861](#fn_3860.md) , Bishop of Thmuis, and Triadelphus
of Nicion, and the presbyters Petrus and Astricius, with others, were
sent to the emperor Constantius, through fear of mischief from the
Arians. They returned, having effected nothing. In this year, Montanus,
Silentiarius of the Palace, \[was sent\]…against \[the\] <span
id="fr_3861"></span>[3862](#fn_3861.md) Bishop, but, a tumult having been
excited, he retired, having failed to effect anything.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p69"></span>XXVI. (353–4.) In this year, Easter-day
was on i <span id="fr_3862"></span>[3863](#fn_3862.md) Pharmuthi; xvii
Moon; vi Kal. Ap.; Epact xii; Gods, v; Indict. xii; Coss. Constantius
Aug. VII, Constantius Cæsar III.; the same governor Sebastianus of
Thrace, Præfect of Egypt.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p71"></span>XXVII. (354–5.) In this year,
Easter-day was on xxi Pharmuthi; xviii Moon; xvi Kal. Mai; Epact xxiii;
Gods, vi; Indict. xiii; Coss. Arbetion, Lollianus; the governor Maximus
the Elder of Nicæa, Prefect of Egypt. In this year, Diogenes, the
Secretary of the Emperor, entered with the design of seizing the Bishop.
But he, too, having raged in vain, went away quietly.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p72"></span>XXVIII. (355–6.) In this year,
Easter-day was on xii Pharmuthi; xvii Moon; vii Id. Ap.; Epact iv; Gods,
i; Indict. xiv, Coss. Constantius Aug. VIII, Julianus Cæsar I; the same
governor Maximus the <span id="page_505">p. 505</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.ii-Page_505"></span>Elder of Nicæa, Præfect of Egypt, who
was succeeded by Cataphronius of Byblus. In this year, Syrianus Dux,
having excited a tumult in the Church on the thirteenth of Mechir, on
the fourteenth <span id="fr_3863"></span>[3864](#fn_3863.md) at night
entered Theonas with his soldiers; but he was unable to capture
\[Athanasius\], for he escaped in a miraculous manner.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p74"></span>XXIX (356–7.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xxvii Phamenoth; xvii Moon; x Kal. Ap., Epact xv; Gods, ii;
Indict. xv; Coss. Constantius Aug. IX, Julianus Cæsar II; the same
governor Cataphronius, of Byblus, Præfect of Egypt, to whom succeeded
Parnassius. Then Georgius entered on the thirtieth of Mechir, and acted
with excessive violence. But Athanasius, the Bishop, had fled, and was
sought for in the city with much oppression, many being in danger on
this account. Therefore no Festal Letter was written <span
id="fr_3864"></span>[3865](#fn_3864.md) .

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p76"></span>XXX. (357–8.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xvii Pharmuthi; Prid. Id. Ap.; xvii Moon; Epact xxvi; Gods, iii;
Indict. i; Coss. Tatianus, Cerealis; the governor Parius of Corinth,
Præfect of Egypt. Athanasius, the Bishop, lay concealed in the city of
Alexandria. But Georgius left on the fifth of Paophi <span
id="fr_3865"></span>[3866](#fn_3865.md) being driven away by the multitude.
On this account, neither this year was the Pope able to send a Festal
Letter.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p78"></span>XXXI. (358–9.) In this year, Easter-day
was on ix <span id="fr_3866"></span>[3867](#fn_3866.md) Pharmuthi; Prid.
Non. Ap.; xx Moon; Epact vii; Gods, iv; Indict. ii; Coss. Eusebius,
Hypatius; the same governor Parius, who was succeeded by Italicianus of
Italy for three months; after him Faustinus, of Chalcedon. Neither this
year did the Pope write \[any Letter\].

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p80"></span>XXXII. (359–60.) In this year,
Easter-day was on xxviii Pharmuthi; ix Kal. Mai; xxi Moon; Epact xviii;
Gods, vi; Indict. iii; Coss. Constantius Aug. X, Julianus Cæsar III; the
governor Faustinus, of Chalcedon, Præfect of Egypt. This Præfect and
Artemius Dux, having entered a private house and a small cell, in search
of Athanasius the Bishop, bitterly tortured Eudæmonis, a perpetual
virgin. On this account no \[Letter\] was written this year.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p81"></span>XXXIII. (360–1.) In this year,
Easter-day was on xiii Pharmuthi, vi Id. Ap.; xvii Moon; Epact xxix;
Gods, vii; Indict. iv; Coss. Taurus, Florentius; the same governor
Faustinus <span id="fr_3867"></span>[3868](#fn_3867.md) , Præfect of Egypt,
who was succeeded by Gerontius the Armenian. He was unable to send \[a
Letter\]. In this year, Constantius died <span
id="fr_3868"></span>[3869](#fn_3868.md) , and Julianus holding the empire
alone, there was a cessation of the persecution against the Orthodox.
For commands were issued everywhere from the emperor Julianus, that the
Orthodox ecclesiastics who had been persecuted in the time of
Constantius should be let alone.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p84"></span>XXXIV. (361–2.) In this year,
Easter-day was on v <span id="fr_3869"></span>[3870](#fn_3869.md)
Pharmuthi; Prid. Kal. Ap.; xxv Moon; Epact x; Gods, i; Indict. v; Coss.
Mamertinus, Nevitta; the same governor Gerontius, who was succeeded by
Olympus of Tarsus. In this year, in Mechir, Athanasius the Bishop
returned to the Church, after his flight, by the command of Julianus
Augustus, who pardoned all the Bishops and Clergy in exile, as was
before said. This year, then, he wrote \[a Letter\].

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p86"></span>XXXV. (362–3.) In this year, Easter-day
was on xxv Pharmuthi; xii Kal. Mai; xx Moon; Epact xxi; Gods, ii;
Indict. vi; Coss. Julianus Augustus IV, Sallustius; the same governor
Olympus, Præfect of Egypt. Pythiodorus Trico of Thebes, a Philosopher,
brought a decree of Julianus on the twenty-seventh of Paophi, and set it
in action against the Bishop first, and uttered many threats. So he
\[Athan.\] left the city at once, and went up to the Thebais. And when
after eight months Julianus died, and his death was announced,
Athanasius returned secretly by night to Alexandria. Then on the eighth
of Thoth, he embarked <span id="fr_3870"></span>[3871](#fn_3870.md) at the
Eastern Hierapolis, and met the emperor Jovian, by whom he was dismissed
with honour. He sent this festal Letter to all the country, while being
driven by persecution from Memphis to the Thebais, and it was delivered
as usual.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p88"></span>XXXVI. (363–4). In this year,
Easter-day was on ix Pharmuthi; Prid. Non. Ap.; xvi Moon; Epact iii;
Gods, iv; Indict. vii; Coss. Jovianus Aug., Varronianus; the governor
Aerius, of Damascus, Præfect; who was succeeded by Maximus of Rapheotis,
and he again by Flavianus the Illyrian. In this year, the Pope returned
to Alexandria and the Church on the twenty-fifth of Mechir. He sent the
Festal Letter, according to custom, from Antioch to all the Bishops in
all the province.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p89"></span>XXXVII. (364–5.) In this year,
Easter-day was on i Pharmuthi; v\[i\] Kal. Ap.; xix Moon; Epact xiv;
Gods, v; Indict. viii; Coss. Valentinianus Aug. I, Valens Aug.; the same
Flavianus, the Illyrian, being governor. We received the Cæsareum; but
again, the Pope being persecuted <span
id="fr_3871"></span>[3872](#fn_3871.md) with accusations, withdrew <span
id="fr_3872"></span>[3873](#fn_3872.md) to the garden of the new river. But
a few days <span id="fr_3873"></span>[3874](#fn_3873.md) after, Barasides,
the notary, came to him with the Præfect and obtained an entrance for
him into the Church. Then, an earthquake happening on the twenty-seventh
of Epiphi <span id="fr_3874"></span>[3875](#fn_3874.md) , the sea returned
from the East, and destroyed many persons, and much damage was caused.

<span id="xxv.iii.ii-p94"></span>XXXVIII. (365–6.) In this year,
Easter-day was on xxi Pharmuthi; xvi Kal. Mai; xx Moon; Epact xxv; Gods,
vi; Indict. ix; in the first year of the Consulship of Gratianus, the
son of Augustus, and Daglaiphus; the same governor Flavianus, Præfect.
On the twenty-seventh of Epiphi, the heathen made an attack, and the
Cæsareum was burnt and consequently many of the citizens suffered great
distress, while the authors of the calamity were condemned and exiled.

an entrance on the twenty-sixth of Thoth <span

house on the side of the enclosure of the Church; and when Tatianus the
Præfect and Trajanus Dux brought him out, he left the city, and was
