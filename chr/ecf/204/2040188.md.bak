<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p3"></span><span class="c40"><span
id="xiii.ii.i.i-p3.1"></span>Introduction.</span>

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p4"></span>1. I supposed that, after so many
proofs of my innocence had been given, my enemies would have shrunk from
further enquiry, and would now have condemned themselves for their false
accusations of others. But as they are not yet abashed, though they have
been so clearly convicted, but, as insensible to shame, persist in their
slanderous reports against me, professing to think that the whole matter
ought to be tried over again (not that they may have judgment passed on
them, for that they avoid, but in order to harass me, and to disturb the
minds of the simple); I therefore thought it necessary to make my
defence unto you, that you may listen to their murmurings no longer, but
may denounce their wickedness and base calumnies. And it is only to you,
who are men of sincere minds, that I offer a defence: as for the
contentious, I appeal confidently to the decisive proofs which I have
against them. For my cause needs no further judgment; for judgment has
already been given, and not once or twice only, but many times. First of
all, it was tried in my own country in an assembly of nearly one hundred
of its Bishops <span id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) ; a second time
at Rome, when, in consequence of letters from Eusebius, both they and we
were summoned, and more than fifty Bishops met <span
id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) ; and a third time in the great
Council assembled at Sardica by order of the most religious Emperors
Constantius and Constans, when my enemies were degraded as false
accusers, and the sentence that was passed in my favour received the
suffrages of more than three hundred Bishops, out of the provinces of
Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis, Palestine, Arabia, Isauria, Cyprus,
Pamphylia, Lycia, Galatia, Dacia, Mœsia, Thrace, Dardania, Macedonia,
Epirus, Thessaly, Achaia, Crete, Dalmatia, Siscia, Pannonia, Noricum,
Italy, Picenum, Tuscany, Campania, Calabria, Apulia, Bruttia, Sicily,
the whole of Africa, Sardinia, Spain, Gaul, and Britain.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p7"></span>Added to these was the testimony <span
id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md) of Ursacius and Valens, who had
formerly calumniated me, but afterwards changed their minds, and not
only gave their assent to the sentence that was passed in my favour, but
also confessed that they themselves and the rest of my enemies were
false accusers; for men who make such a change and such a recantation of
course reflect upon Eusebius and his fellows, for with them they had
contrived the plot against me. Now after a matter has been examined and
decided on such clear evidence by so many eminent Bishops, every one
will confess that further discussion is unnecessary; else, if an
investigation be instituted at this time, it may be again discussed and
again investigated, and there will be no end to such trifling.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p9"></span>2. Now the decision of so many Bishops
was sufficient to confound those who would still fain pretend some
charge against me. But when my enemies also bear testimony in my favour
and against themselves, declaring that the proceedings against me were a
conspiracy, who is there that would not be ashamed to doubt any longer?
The law requires that in the mouth of two or three witnesses <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) judgments shall be settled, and we
have here this great multitude of witnesses in my favour, with the
addition of the proofs afforded by my enemies; so much so that those who
still continue opposed to me no longer attach any importance to their
own arbitrary <span id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md) judgment, but now
have recourse to violence, and in the place of fair reasoning seek to
injure <span id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md) those by whom they were
<span id="page_101">p. 101</span> <span
id="xiii.ii.i.i-Page_101"></span>exposed. For this is the chief cause of
vexation to them, that the measures they carried on in secret, contrived
by themselves in a corner, have been brought to light and disclosed by
Valens and Ursacius; for they are well aware that their recantation
while it clears those whom they have injured, condemns themselves.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p13"></span>Indeed this led to their degradation
in the Council of Sardica, as mentioned before; and with good reason;
for, as the Pharisees of old, when they undertook the defence of
Paul <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md) , fully exposed the
conspiracy which they and the Jews had formed against him; and as the
blessed David was proved to be persecuted unjustly when the persecutor
confessed, ‘I have sinned, my son David <span
id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md) ;’ so it was with these men; being
overcome by the truth they made a request, and delivered it in writing
to Julius, Bishop of Rome. They wrote also to me requesting to be on
terms of peace with me, though they have spread such reports concerning
me; and probably even now they are covered with shame, on seeing that
those whom they sought to destroy by the grace of the Lord are still
alive. Consistently also with this conduct they anathematized Arius and
his heresy; for knowing that Eusebius and his fellows had conspired
against me in behalf of their own misbelief, and of nothing else, as
soon as they had determined to confess their calumnies against me, they
immediately renounced also that antichristian heresy for the sake of
which they had falsely asserted them.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p16"></span>The following are the letters written
in my favour by the Bishops in the several Councils and first the letter
of the Egyptian Bishops.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p17"></span>Encyclical Letter of the Council of
Egypt.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p18"></span>The holy Council assembled at
Alexandria out of Egypt, the Thebais, Libya, and Pentapolis, to the
Bishops of the Catholic Church everywhere, brethren beloved and greatly
longed for in the Lord, greeting.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p19"></span>3. Dearly beloved brethren, we might
have put forth a defence of our brother Athanasius as respects the
conspiracy of Eusebius and his fellows against him, and complained of
his sufferings at their hands, and have exposed all their false charges,
either at the beginning of their conspiracy or upon his arrival at
Alexandria. But circumstances did not permit it then, as you also know;
and lately, after the return of the Bishop Athanasius, we thought that
they would be confounded and covered with shame at their manifest
injustice: in consequence we prevailed with ourselves to remain silent.
Since, however, after all his severe sufferings, after his retirement
into Gaul, after his sojourn in a foreign and far distant country in the
place of his own, after his narrow escape from death through their
calumnies, but thanks to the clemency of the Emperor,—distress which
would have satisfied even the most cruel enemy,—they are still
insensible to shame, are again acting insolently against the Church and
Athanasius; and from indignation at his deliverance venture on still
more atrocious schemes against him, and are ready with an accusation,
fearless of the words in holy Scripture <span
id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md) , ‘A false witness shall not be
unpunished;’ and, ‘The mouth that belieth slayeth the soul;’ we
therefore are unable longer to hold our peace, being amazed at their
wickedness and at the insatiable love of contention displayed in their
intrigues.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p21"></span>For see, they cease not to disturb the
ear of royalty with fresh reports against us; they cease not to write
letters of deadly import, for the destruction of the Bishop who is the
enemy of their impiety. For again have they written to the Emperors
against him; again they wish to conspire against him, charging him with
a butchery which has never taken place; again they wish to shed his
blood, accusing him of a murder that never was committed (for at that
former time would they have murdered him by their calumnies, had we not
had a kind Emperor); again they are urgent, to say the least, that he
should be sent into banishment, while they pretend to lament the
miseries of those alleged to have been exiled by him. They lament before
us things that have never been done, and, not satisfied with what has
been done to him, desire to add thereto other and more cruel treatment.
So mild are they and merciful, and of so just a disposition; or rather
(for the truth shall be spoken) so wicked are they and malicious;
obtaining respect through fear and by threats, rather than by their
piety and justice, as becomes Bishops. They have dared in their letters
to the Emperors to pour forth language such as no contentious person
would employ even among those that are without; they have charged him
with a number of murders and butcheries, and that not before a Governor,
or any other superior officer, but before the three Augusti; nor shrink
they from any journey however long, provided only all greater courts may
be filled with their accusations. For indeed, dearly beloved, their
business consists in accusations, and that of the most solemn character,
forasmuch as the <span id="page_102">p. 102</span> <span
id="xiii.ii.i.i-Page_102"></span>tribunals to which they make their
appeal are the most solemn of any upon earth. And what other end do they
propose by these investigations, except to move the Emperor to capital
punishment?

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p22"></span>4. Their own conduct therefore, and
not that of Athanasius, is the fittest subject for lamentation and
mourning, and one would more properly lament them, for such actions
ought to be bewailed, since it is written, ‘Weep ye not for the dead,
neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goeth away, for he shall
return no more <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md) .’ For their
whole letter contemplates nothing but death; and their endeavour is to
kill, whenever they may be permitted, or if not, to drive into exile.
And this they were permitted to do by the most religious father of the
Emperors, who gratified their fury by the banishment of Athanasius <span
id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) , instead of his death. Now that this
is not the conduct even of ordinary Christians, scarcely even of
heathens, much less of Bishops, who profess to teach others
righteousness, we suppose that your Christian consciences must at once
perceive. How can they forbid others to accuse their brethren, who
themselves become their accusers, and that to the Emperors? How can they
teach compassion for the misfortunes of others, who cannot rest
satisfied even with our banishment? For there was confessedly a general
sentence of banishment against us Bishops, and we all looked upon
ourselves as banished men: and now again we consider ourselves as
restored with Athanasius to our native places, and instead of our former
lamentations and mourning over him, as having the greatest encouragement
and grace,—which may the Lord continue to us, nor suffer Eusebius and
his fellows to destroy?

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p25"></span>Even if their charges against him were
true, here is a certain charge against them, that against the precept of
Christianity, and after his banishment and trials, they have assaulted
him again, and accuse him of murder, and butchery, and other crimes,
which they sound in the royal ears against the Bishops. But how manifold
is their wickedness, and what manner of men think you them, when every
word they speak is false, every charge they bring a calumny, and there
is no truth whatever either in their mouths or their writings! Let us
then at length enter upon these matters, and meet their last charges.
This will prove, that in their former representations in the
Council <span id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) and at the trial their
conduct was dishonourable, or rather their words untrue, besides
exposing them for what they have now advanced.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p27"></span>5. We are indeed ashamed to make any
defence against such charges. But since our reckless accusers lay hold
of any charge, and allege that murders and butcheries were committed
after the return of Athanasius, we beseech you to bear with our answer
though it be somewhat long; for circumstances constrain us. No murder
has been committed either by Athanasius or on his account, since our
accusers, as we said before, compel us to enter upon this humiliating
defence. Slaughter and imprisonment are foreign to our Church. No one
did Athanasius commit into the hands of the executioner; and the prison,
so far as he was concerned, was never disturbed. Our sanctuaries are
now, as they have always been, pure, and honoured only with the Blood of
Christ and His pious worship. Neither Presbyter nor Deacon was destroyed
by Athanasius; he perpetrated no murder, he caused the banishment of no
one. Would that they had never caused the like to him, nor given him
actual experience of it! No one here has been banished on his account;
no one at all except Athanasius himself, the Bishop of Alexandria, whom
they banished, and whom, now that he is restored, they again seek to
entangle in the same or even a more cruel plot than before, setting
their tongues to speak all manner of false and deadly words against him.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p28"></span>For, behold, they now attribute to him
the acts of the magistrates; and although they plainly confess in their
letter that the Prefect of Egypt passed sentence upon certain persons,
they now are not ashamed to impute this sentence to Athanasius; and
that, though he had not at the time entered Alexandria, but was yet on
his return from his place of exile. Indeed he was then in Syria; since
we must needs adduce in defence his length of way from home, that a man
may not be responsible for the actions of a Governor or Prefect of
Egypt. But supposing Athanasius had been in Alexandria, what were the
proceedings of the Prefect to Athanasius? However, he was not even in
the country; and what the Prefect of Egypt did was not done on
ecclesiastical grounds, but for reasons which you will learn from the
records, which, after we understood what they had written, we made
diligent enquiry for, and have transmitted to you. Since then they now
raise a cry against certain things which were never done either by him
or for him, as though they had certainly taken place, and testify
against such evils as though they were assured of their existence; let
them <span id="page_103">p. 103</span> <span
id="xiii.ii.i.i-Page_103"></span>inform us from what Council they
obtained their knowledge of them, from what proofs, and from what
judicial investigation? But if they have no such evidence to bring
forward, and nothing but their own mere assertion, we leave it to you to
consider as regards their former charges also, how the things took
place, and why they so speak of them. In truth, it is nothing but
calumny, and a plot of our enemies, and a temper of ungovernable mood,
and an impiety in behalf of the Arian madmen which is frantic against
true godliness, and desires to root out the orthodox, so that henceforth
the advocates of impiety may preach without fear whatever doctrines they
please. The history of the matter is as follows:—

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p29"></span>6. When Arius, from whom the heresy of
the Arian madmen has its name, was cast out of the Church for his
impiety by Bishop Alexander, of blessed memory, Eusebius and his
fellows, who are the disciples and partners of his impiety, considering
themselves also to have been ejected, wrote frequently to Bishop
Alexander, beseeching him not to leave the heretic Arius out of the
Church <span id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) . But when Alexander in
his piety towards Christ refused to admit that impious man, they
directed their resentment against Athanasius, who was then a Deacon,
because in their busy enquiries they had heard that he was much in the
familiarity of Bishop Alexander, and much honoured by him. And their
hatred of him was greatly increased after they had experience of his
piety towards Christ, in the Council assembled at Nicæa <span
id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) , wherein he spoke boldly against the
impiety of the Arian madmen. But when God raised him to the Episcopate,
their long-cherished malice burst forth into a flame, and fearing his
orthodoxy and resistance of their impiety, they (and especially
Eusebius <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) , who was smitten with
a consciousness of his own evil doings), engaged in all manner of
treacherous designs against him. They prejudiced the Emperor against
him; they frequently threatened him with Councils; and at last assembled
at Tyre; and to this day they cease not to write against him, and are so
implacable that they even find fault with his appointment to the
Episcopate <span id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md) , taking every means
of shewing their enmity and hatred towards him, and spreading false
reports for the sole purpose of thereby vilifying his character.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p34"></span>However, the very misrepresentations
which they now are making do but convict their former statements of
being falsehoods, and a mere conspiracy against him. For they say, that
‘after the death of Bishop Alexander, a certain few having mentioned the
name of Athanasius, six or seven Bishops elected him clandestinely in a
secret place:’ and this is what they wrote to the Emperors, having no
scruple about asserting the greatest falsehoods. Now that the whole
multitude and all the people of the Catholic Church assembled together
as with one mind and body, and cried, shouted, that Athanasius should be
Bishop of their Church, made this the subject of their public prayers to
Christ, and conjured us to grant it for many days and nights, neither
departing themselves from the Church, nor suffering us to do so; of all
this we are witnesses, and so is the whole city, and the province too.
Not a word did they speak against him, as these persons represented, but
gave him the most excellent titles they could devise, calling him good,
pious, Christian, an ascetic <span id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) , a
genuine Bishop. And that he was elected by a majority of our body in the
sight and with the acclamations of all the people, we who elected him
also testify, who are surely more credible witnesses than those who were
not present, and now spread these false accounts.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p36"></span>But yet Eusebius finds fault with the
appointment of Athanasius,—he who perhaps never received any appointment
to his office at all; or if he did, has himself rendered it
invalid <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) . For he had first the
See of Berytus, but leaving that he came to Nicomedia. He left the one
contrary to the law, and contrary to the law invaded the other; having
deserted his own without affection, and holding possession of another’s
without reason; he <span id="page_104">p. 104</span> <span
id="xiii.ii.i.i-Page_104"></span>lost his love for the first in his lust
for another, without even keeping to that which he obtained at the
prompting of his lust. For, behold, withdrawing himself from the second,
again he takes possession of another’s <span
id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) , casting an evil eye all around him
upon the cities of other men, and thinking that godliness <span
id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) consists in wealth and in the
greatness of cities, and making light of the heritage of God to which he
had been appointed; not knowing that ‘where’ even ‘two or three are
gathered in the name of the’ Lord, ‘there’ is the Lord ‘in the midst of
them;’ not considering the words of the Apostle, ‘I will not boast in
another man’s labours;’ not perceiving the charge which he has given,
‘Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed.’ For if this
expression applies to a wife, how much more does it apply to a Church,
and to the same Episcopate; to which whosoever is bound ought not to
seek another, lest he prove an adulterer according to holy Scripture.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p40"></span>7. But though conscious of these his
own misdoings, he has boldly undertaken to arraign the appointment of
Athanasius, to which honourable testimony has been borne by all, and he
ventures to reproach him with his deposition, though he has been deposed
himself, and has a standing proof of his deposition in the appointment
of another in his room. How could either he or Theognius <span
id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) depose another, after they had been
deposed themselves, which is sufficiently proved by the appointment of
others in their room? For you know very well that there were appointed
instead of them Amphion to Nicomedia and Chrestus to Nicæa, in
consequence of their own impiety and connection with the Arian madmen,
who were rejected by the Ecumenic Council. But while they desire to set
aside that true Council, they endeavour to give that name to their own
unlawful combination <span id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) ; while
they are unwilling that the decrees of the Council should be enforced,
they desire to enforce their own decisions; and they use the name of a
Council, while they refuse to submit themselves to one so great as this.
Thus they care not for Councils, but only pretend to do so in order that
they may root out the orthodox, and annul the decrees of the true and
great Council against the Arians, in support of whom, both now and
heretofore, they have ventured to assert these falsehoods against the
Bishop Athanasius. For their former statements resembled those they now
falsely make, viz., that disorderly meetings were held at his
entrance <span id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) , with lamentation and
mourning, the people indignantly refusing to receive him. Now such was
not the case, but, quite the contrary, joy and cheerfulness prevailed,
and the people ran together, hastening to obtain the desired sight of
him. The churches were full of rejoicings, and thanksgivings were
offered up to the Lord everywhere; and all the Ministers and Clergy
beheld him with such feelings, that their souls were possessed with
delight, and they esteemed that the happiest day of their lives. Why
need we mention the inexpressible joy that prevailed among us Bishops,
for we have already said that we counted ourselves to have been
partakers in his sufferings?

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p44"></span>8. Now this being confessedly the
truth of the matter, although it is very differently represented by
them, what weight can be attached to that Council or trial of which they
make their boast? Since they presume thus to interfere in a case which
they did not witness, which they have not examined, and for which they
did not meet, and to write as though they were assured of the truth of
their statements, how can they claim credit respecting these matters for
the consideration of which they say that they did meet together? Will it
not rather be believed that they have acted both in the one case and in
the other out of enmity to us? For what kind of a Council of Bishops was
then held? Was it an assembly which aimed at the truth? Was not almost
every one among them our enemy <span id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) ?
Did not the attack of Eusebius and his fellows upon us proceed from
their zeal for the Arian madness? Did they not urge on the others of
their party? Have we not always written against them as professing the
doctrines of Arius? Was not Eusebius of Cæsarea in Palestine accused by
our confessors of sacrificing to idols <span
id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) ? Was not George proved to have been
deposed by the blessed Alexander <span id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md)
? Were not they charged with various offences, some with this, some with
that?

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p48"></span>How then could such men entertain the
purpose of holding a meeting against us? <span id="page_105">p.
105</span> <span id="xiii.ii.i.i-Page_105"></span>How can they have the
boldness to call that a Council, at which a Count presided, which an
executioner attended, and where an usher <span
id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) instead of the Deacons of the Church
introduced us into Court; and where the Count only spoke, and all
present held their peace, or rather obeyed his directions <span
id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md) ? The removal of those Bishops who
seemed to deserve it was prevented at his desire; and when he gave the
order we were dragged about by soldiers;—or rather Eusebius and his
fellows gave the order, and he was subservient to their will. In short,
dearly beloved, what kind of Council was that, the object of which was
banishment and murder at the pleasure of the Emperor? And of what nature
were their charges?—for here is matter of still greater astonishment.
There was one Arsenius whom they declared to have been murdered; and
they also complained that a chalice belonging to the sacred mysteries
had been broken.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p51"></span>Now Arsenius is alive, and prays to be
admitted to our communion. He waits for no other testimony to prove that
he is still living, but himself confesses it, writing in his own person
to our brother Athanasius, whom they positively asserted to be his
murderer. The impious wretches were not ashamed to accuse him of having
murdered a man who was at a great distance from him, being separated by
so great a distance, whether by sea or land, and whose abode at that
time no one knew. Nay, they even had the boldness to remove him out of
sight, and place him in concealment, though he had suffered no injury;
and, if it had been possible, they would have transported him to another
world, nay, or have taken him from life in earnest, so that either by a
true or false statement of his murder they might in good earnest destroy
Athanasius. But thanks to divine Providence for this also which
permitted them not to succeed in their injustice, but presented
Arsenius <span id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md) alive to the eyes of
all men, who has clearly proved their conspiracy and calumnies. He does
not withdraw from us as murderers, nor hate us as having injured him
(for indeed he has suffered no evil at all); but he desires to hold
communion with us; he wishes to be numbered among us, and has written to
this effect.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p53"></span>9. Nevertheless they laid their plot
against Athanasius, accusing him of having murdered a person who was
still alive; and those same men are the authors of his banishment <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) . For it was not the father of the
Emperors, but their calumnies, that sent him into exile. Consider
whether this is not the truth. When nothing was discovered to the
prejudice of our fellow-minister Athanasius, but still the Count
threatened him with violence, and was very zealous against him, the
Bishop <span id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) fled from this violence
and went up <span id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md) to the most
religious Emperor, where he protested against the Count and their
conspiracy against him, and requested either that a lawful Council of
Bishops might be assembled, or that the Emperor would himself receive
his defence concerning the charges they brought against him. Upon this
the Emperor wrote in anger, summoning them before him, and declaring
that he would hear the cause himself, and for that purpose he also
ordered a Council to be held. Whereupon Eusebius and his fellows went up
and falsely charged Athanasius, not with the same offences which they
had published against him at Tyre, but with an intention of detaining
the vessels laden with corn, as though Athanasius had been the man to
pretend that he could stop the exports of corn from Alexandria to
Constantinople <span id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) .

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p58"></span>Certain of our friends were present at
the palace with Athanasius, and heard the threats of the Emperor upon
receiving this report. And when Athanasius cried out upon the calumny,
and positively declared that it was not true, (for how, he argued,
should he a poor man, and in a private station, be able to do such a
thing?) Eusebius did not hesitate publicly to repeat the charge, and
swore that Athanasius was a rich man, and powerful, and able to do
anything; in order that it might thence be supposed that he had used
this language. Such was the accusation these venerable Bishops proffered
against him. But the grace of God proved superior to their wickedness,
for it moved the pious Emperor to mercy, who instead of death passed
upon him the sentence of banishment. Thus their calumnies, and nothing
else, were the cause of this. For the Emperor, in the letter which he
previously wrote, complained of their conspiracy, censured their
machinations, and condemned the Meletians as unscrupulous and deserving
of execration; in short, expressed himself in the severest terms
concerning them. For he was greatly moved when he heard the story of the
dead alive; he was moved at hearing of <span id="page_106">p. 106</span>
<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-Page_106"></span>murder in the case of one alive,
and not deprived of life. We have sent you the letter.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p59"></span>10. But these marvellous men, Eusebius
and his fellows, to make a show of refuting the truth of the case, and
the statements contained in this letter, put forward the name of a
Council, and ground its proceedings upon the authority of the Emperor.
Hence the attendance of a Count at their meeting, and the soldiers as
guards of the Bishops, and royal letters compelling the attendance of
any persons whom they required. But observe here the strange character
of their machinations, and the inconsistency of their bold measures, so
that by some means or other they may take Athanasius away from us. For
if as Bishops they claimed for themselves alone the judgment of the
case, what need was there for the attendance of a Count and soldiers? or
how was it that they assembled under the sanction of royal letters? Or
if they required the Emperor’s countenance and wished to derive their
authority from him, why were they then annulling his judgment? and when
he declared in the letter which he wrote, that the Meletians were
calumniators, unscrupulous, and that Athanasius was most innocent, and
made much stir about the pretended murder of the living, how was it that
they determined that the Meletians had spoken the truth, and that
Athanasius was guilty of the offence; and were not ashamed to make the
living dead, living both after the Emperor’s judgment, and at the time
when they met together, and who even until this day is amongst us? So
much concerning the case of Arsenius.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p60"></span>11. And as for the cup belonging to
the mysteries, what was it, or where was it broken by Macarius? for this
is the report which they spread up and down. But as for Athanasius, even
his accusers would not have ventured to blame him, had they not been
suborned by them. However, they attribute the origin of the offence to
him; although it ought not to be imputed even to Macarius who is clear
of it. And they are not ashamed to parade the sacred mysteries before
Catechumens, and worse than that, even before heathens <span
id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) : whereas, they ought to attend to
what is written, ‘It is good to keep close the secret of a king <span
id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) ;’ and as the Lord has charged us,
‘Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls
before swine <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) .’ We ought not
then to parade the holy mysteries before the uninitiated, lest the
heathen in their ignorance deride them, and the Catechumens being
over-curious be offended. However, what was the cup, and where and
before whom was it broken? It is the Meletians who make the accusation,
who are not worthy of the least credit, for they have been schismatics
and enemies of the Church, not of a recent date, but from the times of
the blessed Peter, Bishop and Martyr <span
id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) . They formed a conspiracy against
Peter himself; they calumniated his successor Achillas; they accused
Alexander even before the Emperor; and being thus well versed in these
arts, they have now transferred their enmity to Athanasius, acting
altogether in accordance with their former wickedness. For as they
slandered those that have been before him, so now they have slandered
him. But their calumnies and false accusations have never prevailed
against him until now, that they have got Eusebius and his fellows for
their assistants and patrons, on account of the impiety which these have
adopted from the Arian madmen, which has led them to conspire against
many Bishops, and among the rest Athanasius.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p65"></span>Now the place where they say the cup
was broken, was not a Church; there was no Presbyter in occupation of
the place; and the day on which they say that Macarius did the deed, was
not the Lord’s day. Since then there was no church there; since there
was no one to perform the sacred office; and since the day did not
require the use of it <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) ; what was
this cup belonging to the mysteries, and when, or where was it broken?
There are many cups, it is plain, both in private houses, and in the
public market; and if a person breaks one of them, he is not guilty of
impiety. But the cup which belongs to the mysteries, and which if it be
broken intentionally, makes the perpetrator of the deed an impious
person, is found only among those who lawfully preside. This is the only
description that can be given of this kind of cup; there is none other;
this you legally give to the people to drink; this you have received
according to the canon of the Church <span
id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) ; this belongs only to those who
preside over the Catholic Church, for to you only it appertains to
administer the Blood of Christ, and to none besides. But as he who
breaks the cup belonging to the mysteries is an impious person, much
more impious is he who treats the <span id="page_107">p. 107</span>
<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-Page_107"></span>Blood of Christ with contumely:
and he does so who ‘does this <span id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) ’
contrary to the rule of the Church. (We say this, not as if a cup even
of the schismatics was broken by Macarius, for there was no cup there at
all; how should there be? where there was neither Lord’s house nor any
the belonging to the Church, nay, it was not the time of the celebration
of the mysteries). Now such a person is the notorious Ischyras, who was
never appointed to his office by the Church, and when Alexander admitted
the Presbyters that had been ordained by Meletius, he was not even
numbered amongst them; and therefore did not receive ordination even
from that quarter.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p69"></span>12. By what means then did Ischyras
become a Presbyter? who was it that ordained him? was it Colluthus? for
this is the only supposition that remains. But it is well known and no
one has any doubt about the matter that Colluthus died a Presbyter, and
that every ordination of his was invalid, and that all that were
ordained by him during the schism were reduced to the condition of
laymen, and in that rank appear in the congregation. How then can it be
believed that a private person, occupying a private house had in his
possession a sacred chalice? But the truth is, they gave the name of
Presbyter at the time to a private person, and gratified him with this
title to support him in his iniquitous conduct towards us; and now as
the reward of his accusations they procure for him the erection of a
Church <span id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) . So that this man had
then no Church; but as the reward of his malice and subserviency to them
in accusing us, he receives now what he had not before; nay, perhaps
they have even remunerated his services with the Episcopate, for so he
goes about reporting, and accordingly behaves towards us with great
insolence. Thus are such rewards as these now bestowed by Bishops upon
accusers and calumniators though indeed it is reasonable, in the case of
an accomplice, that as they have made him a partner in their
proceedings, so they should also make him their associate in their own
Episcopate. But this is not all; give ear yet further to their
proceedings at that time.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p71"></span>13. Being unable to prevail against
the truth, though they had thus set themselves in array against it, and
Ischyras having proved nothing at Tyre, but being shewn to be a
calumniator, and the calumny ruining their plot, they defer proceedings
for fresh evidence, and profess that they are going to send to the
Mareotis certain of their party to enquire diligently into the matter.
Accordingly they dispatched secretly, with the assistance of the civil
power, persons to whom we openly objected on many accounts, as being of
the party of Arius, and therefore our enemies; namely, Diognius <span
id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) , Maris, Theodorus, Macedonius, and
two others, young both in years and mind <span
id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md) , Ursacius and Valens from Pannonia;
who, after they had undertaken this long journey for the purpose of
sitting in judgment upon their enemy, set out again from Tyre for
Alexandria. They did not shrink from becoming witnesses themselves,
although they were the judges, but openly adopted every means of
furthering their design, and undertook any labour or journey whatsoever
in order to bring to a successful issue the conspiracy which was in
progress. They left the Bishop Athanasius detained in a foreign country
while they themselves entered their enemy’s city, as if to have their
revel both against his Church and against his people. And what was more
outrageous still, they took with them the accuser Ischyras, but would
not permit Macarius, the accused person, to accompany them, but left him
in custody at Tyre. For ‘Macarius the Presbyter of Alexandria’ was made
answerable for the charge far and near.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p74"></span>14. They therefore entered Alexandria
alone with the accuser, their partner in lodging, board, and cup; and
taking with them Philagrius the Prefect of Egypt they proceeded to the
Mareotis, and there carried on the so-called investigation by
themselves, all their own way, with the forementioned person. Although
the Presbyters frequently begged that they might be present, they would
not permit them. The Presbyters both of the city and of the whole
country desired to attend, that they might detect who and whence the
persons were who were suborned by Ischyras. But they forbade the
Ministers to be present, while they carried on the examination
concerning church, cup, table, and the holy things, before the heathen;
nay, worse than that, they summoned heathen witnesses during the enquiry
concerning a cup belonging to the mysteries; and those persons who they
affirmed were taken out of the way by Athanasius by summons of the
Receiver-general, and they knew not where in the world they were, these
same individuals they brought forward before themselves and the Prefect
only, and avowedly used their testimony, whom they affirmed without
shame to have been secreted by the Bishop Athanasius.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p75"></span><span id="page_108">p. 108</span>
<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-Page_108"></span>But here too their only object is
to effect his death, and so they again pretend that persons are dead who
are still alive, following the same method they adopted in the case of
Arsenius. For the men are living, and are to be seen in their own
country; but to you who are at a great distance from the spot they make
a great stir about the matter as though they had disappeared, in order
that, as the evidence is so far removed from you, they may falsely
accuse our brother-minister, as though he used violence and the civil
power; whereas they themselves have in all respects acted by means of
that power and the countenance of others. For their proceedings in the
Mareotis were parallel to those at Tyre; and as there a Count attended
with military assistance, and would permit nothing either to be said or
done contrary to their pleasure, so here also the Prefect of Egypt was
present with a band of men, frightening all the members of the Church,
and permitting no one to give true testimony. And what was the strangest
thing of all, the persons who came, whether as judges or witnesses, or,
what was more likely, in order to serve their own purposes and those of
Eusebius, lived in the same place with the accuser, even in his house,
and there seemed to carry on the investigation as they pleased.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p76"></span>15. We suppose you are not ignorant
what outrages they committed at Alexandria; for they are reported
everywhere. Naked swords <span id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) were at
work against the holy virgins and brethren; scourges were at work
against their persons, esteemed honourable in the sight of God, so that
their feet were lamed by the stripes, whose souls are whole and sound in
purity and all good works <span id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) . The
trades were excited against them; and the heathen multitude was set to
strip them naked, to beat them, wantonly to insult them, and to threaten
them with their altars and sacrifices. And one coarse fellow, as though
license had now been given them by the Prefect in order to gratify the
Bishops, took hold of a virgin by the hand, and dragged her towards an
altar that happened to be near, imitating the practice of compelling to
offer sacrifice in time of persecution. When this was done, the virgins
took to flight, and a shout of laughter was raised by the heathen
against the Church; the Bishops being in the place, and occupying the
very house where this was going on; and from which, in order to obtain
favour with them, the virgins were assaulted with naked swords, and were
exposed to all kinds of danger, and insult, and wanton violence. And
this treatment they received on a fast-day <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md) , and at the hands of persons who
themselves were feasting with the Bishops indoors.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p80"></span>16. Foreseeing these things, and
reflecting that the entrance of enemies into a place is no ordinary
calamity, we protested against this commission. And Alexander <span
id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517.md) , Bishop of Thessalonica, considering
the same, wrote to the people residing there, discovering the
conspiracy, and testifying of the plot. They indeed reckon him to be one
of themselves, and account him a partner in their designs; but they only
prove thereby the violence they have exercised towards him. For even the
profligate Ischyras himself was only induced by fear and violence to
proceed in the matter, and was obliged by force to undertake the
accusation. As a proof of this, he wrote himself to our brother
Athanasius <span id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md) , confessing that
nothing of the kind that was alleged had taken place there, but that he
was suborned to make a false statement. This declaration he made, though
he was never admitted by Athanasius as a Presbyter, nor received such a
title of grace from him, nor was entrusted by way of recompense with the
erection of a Church, nor expected the bribe of a Bishopric; all of
which he obtained from them in return for undertaking the accusation.
Moreover, his whole family held communion with us <span
id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519.md) , which they would not have done had
they been injured in the slightest degree.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p84"></span>17. Now to prove that these things are
facts and not mere assertions, we have the testimony <span
id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md) of all the Presbyters of the
Mareotis <span id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521.md) , who always accompany
the Bishop in his visitations, and who also wrote at the time against
Ischyras. But neither those of them who came to Tyre were allowed to
declare the truth <span id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522.md) , nor could
those who remained in the Mareotis obtain permission to refute the
calumnies of Ischyras <span id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523.md) . The
copies also of the letters of Alexander, and of the Presbyters, and of
Ischyras will prove the same thing. We have sent also the letter of the
father of the Emperors, in which he expresses his indignation that the
murder of Arsenius was charged upon any one while the man was still
alive; as also his astonishment at the variable and in<span
id="page_109">p. 109</span> <span
id="xiii.ii.i.i-Page_109"></span>consistent character of their
accusations with respect to the cup; since at one time they accused the
Presbyter Macarius, at another the Bishop Athanasius, of having broken
it with his hands. He declares also on the one hand that the Meletians
are calumniators, and on the other that Athanasius is perfectly
innocent.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p89"></span>And are not the Meletians
calumniators, and above all John <span id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524.md)
, who after coming into the Church, and communicating with us, after
condemning himself, and no longer taking any part in the proceedings
respecting the cup, when he saw Eusebius and his fellows zealously
supporting the Arian madmen, though they had not the daring to
co-operate with them openly, but were attempting to employ others as
their masks, undertook a character, as an actor in the heathen
theatres <span id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md) ? The subject of the
drama was a contest of Arians; the real design of the piece being their
success, but John and his partizans being put on the stage and playing
the parts, in order that under colour of these, the supporters of the
Arians in the garb of judges might drive away the enemies of their
impiety, firmly establish their impious doctrines, and bring the Arians
into the Church. And those who wish to drive out true religion strive
all they can to prevail by irreligion; they who have chosen the part of
that impiety which wars against Christ, endeavour to destroy the enemies
thereof, as though they were impious persons; and they impute to us the
breaking of the cup, for the purpose of making it appear that
Athanasius, equally with themselves, is guilty of impiety towards
Christ.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p92"></span>For what means this mention of a cup
belonging to the mysteries by them? Whence comes this religious regard
for the cup among those who support impiety towards Christ? Whence comes
it that Christ’s cup is known to them who know not Christ? How can they
who profess to honour that cup, dishonour the God of the cup? or how can
they who lament over the cup, seek to murder the Bishop who celebrates
the mysteries therewith? for they would have murdered him, had it been
in their power. And how can they who lament the loss of the throne that
was Episcopally covered <span id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md) , seek
to destroy the Bishop that sat upon it, to the end that both the throne
may be without its Bishop, and that the people may be deprived of godly
doctrine? It was not then the cup, nor the murder, nor any of those
portentous deeds they talk about, that induced them to act thus; but the
forementioned heresy of the Arians, for the sake of which they conspired
against Athanasius and other Bishops, and still continue to wage war
against the Church.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p94"></span>Who are they that have really been the
cause of murders and banishments? Is it not these? Who are they that,
availing themselves of external support, conspire against the Bishops?
Are not Eusebius and his fellows the men, and not Athanasius, as they
say in their letters? Both he and others have suffered at their hands.
Even at the time of which we speak, four Presbyters <span
id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) of Alexandria, though they had not
even proceeded to Tyre, were banished by their means. Who then are they
whose conduct calls for tears and lamentations? Is it not they, who
after they have been guilty of one course of persecution, do not scruple
to add to it a second, but have recourse to all manner of falsehood, in
order that they may destroy a Bishop who will not give way to their
impious heresy? Hence arises the enmity of Eusebius and his fellows;
hence their proceedings at Tyre; hence their pretended trials; hence
also now the letters which they have written even without any trial,
expressing the utmost confidence in their statements; hence their
calumnies before the father of the Emperors, and before the most
religious Emperors themselves.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p96"></span>18. For it is necessary that you
should know what is now reported to the prejudice of our fellow-minister
Athanasius, in order that you may thereby be led to condemn their
wickedness, and may perceive that they desire nothing else but to murder
him. A quantity of corn was given by the father of the Emperors for the
support of certain widows, partly of Libya, and partly certain out of
Egypt. They have all received it up to this time, Athanasius getting
nothing therefrom, but the trouble of assisting them. But now, although
the recipients themselves make no complaint, but acknowledge that they
have received it, Athanasius has been accused of selling all the corn,
and appropriating the profits to his own use: and the Emperor wrote to
this effect about it, charging him with the offence in consequence of
the calumnies which had been raised against him. Now who are they which
have raised these calumnies? Is it not those who after they have been
guilty of one course of persecution, scruple not to set on foot another?
Who are the authors of those letters which are said to have come from
the Emperor? Are not the Arians, who are so zealous against Athanasius,
and scruple not to speak and write anything against him? No one would
pass over persons <span id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span
id="xiii.ii.i.i-Page_110"></span>who have acted as they have done, in
order to entertain suspicion of others. Nay, the proof of their calumny
appears to be most evident for they are anxious under cover of it, to
take away the corn from the Church, and to give it to the Arians. And
this circumstance more than any other, brings the matter home to the
authors of this design and their principals, who scrupled neither to set
on foot a charge of murder against Athanasius, as a base means of
prejudicing the Emperor against him, nor yet to take away from the
Clergy of the Church the subsistence of the poor, in order that in fact
they might make gain for the heretics.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p97"></span>19. We have sent also the testimony of
our fellow-ministers in Libya, Pentapolis, and Egypt, from which
likewise you may learn the false accusations which have been brought
against Athanasius. And these things they do, in order that, the
professors of true godliness being henceforth induced by fear to remain
quiet, the heresy of the impious Arians may be brought in in its stead.
But thanks be to your piety, dearly beloved, that you have frequently
anathematized the Arians in your letters, and have never given them
admittance into the Church. The exposure of Eusebius and his fellows is
also easy and ready at hand. For behold, after their former letters
concerning the Arians, of which also we have sent you copies, they now
openly stir up the Arian madmen against the Church, though the whole
Catholic Church has anathematized them; they have appointed a
Bishop <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) over them; they distract
the Churches with threats and alarms, that they may gain assistants in
their impiety in every part. Moreover, they send Deacons to the Arian
madmen, who openly join their assemblies; they write letters to them,
and receive answers from them, thus making schisms in the Church, and
holding communion with them; and they send to every part, commending
their heresy, and repudiating the Church, as you will perceive from the
letters they have addressed to the Bishop of Rome <span
id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) and perhaps to yourselves also. You
perceive therefore, dearly beloved, that these things are not
undeserving of vengeance: they are indeed dreadful and alien from the
doctrine of Christ.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p100"></span>Wherefore we have assembled together,
and have written to you, to request of your Christian wisdom to receive
this our declaration and sympathize with our brother Athanasius, and to
shew your indignation against Eusebius and his fellows who have essayed
such things, in order that such malice and wickedness may no longer
prevail against the Church. We call upon you to be the avengers of such
injustice, reminding you of the injunction of the Apostle, ‘Put away
from among yourselves that wicked person <span
id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) .’ Wicked indeed is their conduct, and
unworthy of your communion. Wherefore give no further heed to them,
though they should again write to you against the Bishop Athanasius (for
all that proceeds from them is false); not even though they subscribe
their letter with names <span id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md) of
Egyptian Bishops. For it is evident that it will not be we who write,
but the Meletians <span id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md) , who have
ever been schismatics, and who even unto this day make disturbances and
raise factions in the Churches. For they ordain improper persons, and
all but heathens; and they are guilty of such actions as we are ashamed
to set down in writing, but which you may learn from those whom we have
sent unto you, who will also deliver to you our letter.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p104"></span>20. Thus wrote the Bishops of Egypt
to all Bishops, and to Julius, Bishop of Rome.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p33"></span> The Eusebians alleged that,
fifty-four Bishops of the two parties of S. Alexander and Meletius being
assembled for the election, and having sworn to elect by the common
voice, six or seven of these broke their oaths in favour of S.
Athanasius, whom no one had thought of, and consecrated him in secret to
the great surprise and scandal of both ecclesiastical and lay persons.
vid. Socr. ii. 17. Philostorgius (<span class="c10"><span
id="xiii.ii.i.i-p33.2"></span>a.d.</span> 425) adds particulars,
explanatory or corrective of this statement, of which the Bishops in the
text do not seem to have heard; viz., that Athanasius with his party one
night seized on the Church of St. Dionysius, and compelled two Bishops
whom he found there to consecrate him against their will; that he was in
consequence anathematized by all the other Bishops, but that, fortifying
himself in his position, he sent in his election to the Emperor, and by
this means obtained its confirmation. *H. E.* ii. 16. It appears, in
matter of fact, that S. Athan. was absent at time of his election; as
Socrates says, in order to avoid it, or as Epiphanius, on business at
the Court; these reasons are compatible. \[Cf. Prolegg. ch. ii. §4, and
Gwatkin’s note, quoted there.\]

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p35"></span> It is contested whether S. Athan. was

in different <span class="c10"><span

those who lived a life, as afterwards followed in Monasteries, in the

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p55"></span> The circumstances of this appeal,
which are related by Athan. below, §86, are thus summed up by Gibbon;
“Before the final sentence could be pronounced at Tyre, the intrepid
primate threw himself into a bark which was ready to hoist sail for the
imperial city. The request of a formal audience might have been opposed
or eluded; but Athanasius concealed his arrival, watched the moment of
Constantine’s return from an adjacent villa, and boldly encountered his
angry sovereign as he passed on horseback through the principal street
of Constantinople. So strange an apparition excited his surprise and
indignation; and the guards were ordered to remove the importunate
suitor; but his resentment was subdued by involuntary respect; and the
haughty spirit of the Emperor was awed by the courage and eloquence of a
Bishop, who implored his justice and awakened his conscience.” *Decl.
and Fall,* xxi. Athan. was a small man in person.

<span id="xiii.ii.i.i-p61"></span> This period, when Christianity was
acknowledged by the state but not embraced by the population, is just
the time when we hear most of this Reserve as a principle. While
Christians were but a sect, persecution enforced a discipline, and when
they were commensurate with the nation, faith made it unnecessary. We
are now returned to the state of the fourth century.
