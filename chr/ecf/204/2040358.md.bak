<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—<span
class="c10"><span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p1.2"></span>Texts Explained;
Thirdly, [Hebrews i. 4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p1.3"></span>.</span> *Additional texts brought as
objections; e.g.* <span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p1.4"></span>*[Heb. i.
4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p1.5"></span>; vii. 22. Whether the word ‘better’
implies likeness to the Angels; and ‘made’ or ‘become’ implies creation.
Necessary to consider the circumstances under which Scripture speaks.
Difference between ‘better’ and ‘greater;’ texts in proof. ‘Made’ or
‘become’ a general word. Contrast in* <span
id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p1.6"></span>*[Heb. i.
4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p1.7"></span>, between the Son and the Works in point
of nature. The difference of the punishments under the two Covenants
shews the difference of the natures of the Son and the Angels. ‘Become’
relates not to the nature of the Word, but to His manhood and office and
relation towards us. Parallel passages in which the term is applied to
the Eternal Father.*

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p2"></span>53. <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p2.1"></span>But</span> it is written, say they, in
the Proverbs, ‘The Lord created me the beginning of His ways, for His
Works <span id="fr_2133"></span>[2134](#fn_2133.md) ;’ and in the Epistle
to the Hebrews the Apostle says, ‘Being made so much better than the
Angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than
they <span id="fr_2134"></span>[2135](#fn_2134.md) .’ And soon after,
‘Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider
the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus, who was
faithful to Him that made Him <span id="fr_2135"></span>[2136](#fn_2135.md)
.’ And in the Acts, ‘Therefore let all the house of Israel know
assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified
both Lord and Christ <span id="fr_2136"></span>[2137](#fn_2136.md) .’ These
passages they brought forward at every turn, mistaking their sense,
under the idea that they proved that the Word of God was a creature and
work and one of things originate; and thus they deceive the thoughtless,
making the language of Scripture their pretence, but instead of the true
sense sowing upon it the poison of their own heresy. For had they known,
they would not have been irreligious against ‘the Lord of glory <span
id="fr_2137"></span>[2138](#fn_2137.md) ,’ nor have wrested the good words
of Scripture. If then henceforward openly adopting Caiaphas’s way, they
have determined on judaizing, and are ignorant of the text, that verily
God shall dwell upon the earth <span
id="fr_2138"></span>[2139](#fn_2138.md) , let them not inquire into the
Apostolical sayings; for this is not the manner of Jews. But if, mixing
themselves up with the godless Manichees <span
id="fr_2139"></span>[2140](#fn_2139.md) , they deny that ‘the Word was made
flesh,’ and His Incarnate presence, then let them not bring forward the
Proverbs, for this is out of place with the Manichees. But if for
preferment-sake, and the lucre of avarice which follows <span
id="fr_2140"></span>[2141](#fn_2140.md) , and the desire for good repute,
they venture not on denying the text, ‘The Word was made flesh,’ since
so it is written, either let them rightly interpret the words of
Scripture, of the embodied presence of the Saviour, or, if they deny
their sense, let them deny that the Lord became man at all. For it is
unseemly, while confessing that ‘the Word became flesh,’ yet to be
ashamed at what is written of Him, and on that account to corrupt the
sense.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p11"></span>54. For it is written, ‘So much
better than <span id="page_338">p. 338</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-Page_338"></span>the Angels;’ let us then first
examine this. Now it is right and necessary, as in all divine Scripture,
so here, faithfully to expound the time of which the Apostle wrote, and
the person <span id="fr_2141"></span>[2142](#fn_2141.md) , and the point;
lest the reader, from ignorance missing either these or any similar
particular, may be wide of the true sense. This understood that
inquiring eunuch, when he thus besought Philip, ‘I pray thee, of whom
doth the Prophet speak this? of himself, or of some other man <span
id="fr_2142"></span>[2143](#fn_2142.md) ?’ for he feared lest, expounding
the lesson unsuitably to the person, he should wander from the right
sense. And the disciples, wishing to learn the time of what was
foretold, besought the Lord, ‘Tell us,’ said they, ‘when shall these
things be? and what is the sign of Thy coming <span
id="fr_2143"></span>[2144](#fn_2143.md) ?’ And again, hearing from the
Saviour the events of the end, they desired to learn the time of it,
that they might be kept from error themselves, and might be able to
teach others; as, for instance, when they had learned, they set right
the Thessalonians <span id="fr_2144"></span>[2145](#fn_2144.md) , who were
going wrong. When then one knows properly these points, his
understanding of the faith is right and healthy; but if he mistakes any
such points, forthwith he falls into heresy. Thus Hymenæus and Alexander
and their fellows <span id="fr_2145"></span>[2146](#fn_2145.md) were beside
the time, when they said that the resurrection had already been; and the
Galatians were after the time, in making much of circumcision now. And
to miss the person was the lot of the Jews, and is still, who think that
of one of themselves is said, ‘Behold, the Virgin shall conceive, and
bear a Son, and they shall call his Name Emmanuel, which is being
interpreted, God with us <span id="fr_2146"></span>[2147](#fn_2146.md) ;’
and that, ‘A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you <span
id="fr_2147"></span>[2148](#fn_2147.md) ,’ is spoken of one of the
Prophets; and who, as to the words, ‘He was led as a sheep to the
slaughter <span id="fr_2148"></span>[2149](#fn_2148.md) ,’ instead of
learning from Philip, conjecture them spoken of Isaiah or some other of
the former Prophets <span id="fr_2149"></span>[2150](#fn_2149.md) .

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p21"></span>55. (3.) Such has been the state of
mind under which Christ’s enemies have fallen into their execrable
heresy. For had they known the person, and the subject, and the season
of the Apostle’s words, they would not have expounded of Christ’s
divinity what belongs to His manhood, nor in their folly have committed
so great an act of irreligion. Now this will be readily seen, if one
expounds properly the beginning of this lection. For the Apostle says,
‘God who at sundry times and divers manners spake in times past unto the
fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His
Son <span id="fr_2150"></span>[2151](#fn_2150.md) ;’ then again shortly
after he says, ‘when He had by Himself purged our sins, He sat down on
the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become so much better than
the Angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name
than they <span id="fr_2151"></span>[2152](#fn_2151.md) .’ It appears then
that the Apostle’s words make mention of that time, when God spoke unto
us by His Son, and when a purging of sins took place. Now when did He
speak unto us by His Son, and when did purging of sins take place? and
when did He become man? when, but subsequently to the Prophets in the
last days? Next, proceeding with his account of the economy in which we
were concerned, and speaking of the last times, he is naturally led to
observe that not even in the former times was God silent with men, but
spoke to them by the Prophets. And, whereas the prophets ministered, and
the Law was spoken by Angels, while the Son too came on earth, and that
in order to minister, he was forced to add, ‘Become so much better than
the Angels,’ wishing to shew that, as much as the son excels a servant,
so much also the ministry of the Son is better than the ministry of
servants. Contrasting then the old ministry and the new, the Apostle
deals freely with the Jews, writing and saying, ‘Become so much better
than the Angels.’ This is why throughout he uses no comparison, such as
‘become greater,’ or ‘more honourable,’ lest we should think of Him and
them as one in kind, but ‘better’ is his word, by way of marking the
difference of the Son’s nature from things originated. And of this we
have proof from divine Scripture; David, for instance, saying in the
Psalm, ‘One day in Thy courts is better than a thousand <span
id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152.md) :’ and Solomon crying out, ‘Receive
my instruction and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.
For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired
are not to be compared to it <span id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153.md)
.’ Are not wisdom and stones of the earth different in essence and
separate in nature? Are heavenly courts at all akin to earthly houses?
Or is there any similarity between things eternal and spiritual, and
things temporal and mortal? And this is what Isaiah says, ‘Thus saith
the Lord unto the eunuchs that keep My sabbaths, and choose the things
that please Me, and take hold of My Covenant; even unto them will I
<span id="page_339">p. 339</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-Page_339"></span>give in Mine house, and within My
walls, a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will
give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off <span
id="fr_2154"></span>[2155](#fn_2154.md) .’ In like manner there is nought
akin between the Son and the Angels; so that the word ‘better’ is not
used to compare but to contrast, because of the difference of His nature
from them. And therefore the Apostle also himself, when he interprets
the word ‘better,’ places its force in nothing short of the Son’s
excellence over things originated, calling the one Son, the other
servants; the one, as a Son with the Father, sitting on the right; and
the others, as servants, standing before Him, and being sent, and
fulfilling offices.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p27"></span>56. Scripture, in speaking thus,
implies, O Arians, not that the Son is originate, but rather other than
things originate, and proper to the Father, being in His bosom. (4.)
Nor <span id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155.md) does even the expression
‘become,’ which here occurs, shew that the Son is originate, as ye
suppose. If indeed it were simply ‘become’ and no more, a case might
stand for the Arians; but, whereas they are forestalled with the word
‘Son’ throughout the passage, shewing that He is other than things
originate, so again not even the word ‘become’ occurs absolutely <span
id="fr_2156"></span>[2157](#fn_2156.md) , but ‘better’ is immediately
subjoined. For the writer thought the expression immaterial, knowing
that in the case of one who was confessedly a genuine Son, to say
‘become’ is the same with saying that He had been made, and is,
‘better.’ For it matters not even if we speak of what is generate, as
‘become’ or ‘made;’ but on the contrary, things originate cannot be
called generate, God’s handiwork as they are, except so far as after
their making they partake of the generate Son, and are therefore said to
have been generated also, not at all in their own nature, but because of
their participation of the Son in the Spirit <span
id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157.md) . And this again divine Scripture
recognises; for it says in the case of things originate, ‘All things
came to be through Him, and without Him nothing came to be <span
id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158.md) ,’ and, ‘In wisdom hast Thou made
them all <span id="fr_2159"></span>[2160](#fn_2159.md) ;’ but in the case
of sons which are generate, ‘To Job there came to be seven sons and
three daughters <span id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160.md) ,’ and,
‘Abraham was an hundred years old when there came to be to him Isaac his
son <span id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161.md) ;’ and Moses said <span
id="fr_2162"></span>[2163](#fn_2162.md) , ‘If to any one there come to be
sons.’ Therefore since the Son is other than things originate, alone the
proper offspring of the Father’s essence, this plea of the Arians about
the word ‘become’ is worth nothing.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p36"></span>(5.) If moreover, baffled so far,
they should still violently insist that the language is that of
comparison, and that comparison in consequence implies oneness of kind,
so that the Son is of the nature of Angels, they will in the first place
incur the disgrace of rivalling and repeating what Valentinus held, and
Carpocrates, and those other heretics, of whom the former said that the
Angels were one in kind with the Christ, and Carpocrates that Angels are
framers of the world <span id="fr_2163"></span>[2164](#fn_2163.md) .
Perchance it is under the instruction of these masters that they compare
the Word of God with the Angels.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p38"></span>57. Though surely amid such
speculations, they will be moved by the sacred poet, saying, ‘Who is he
among the gods that shall be like unto the Lord <span
id="fr_2164"></span>[2165](#fn_2164.md) ,’ and, ‘Among the gods there is
none like unto Thee, O Lord <span id="fr_2165"></span>[2166](#fn_2165.md)
.’ However, they must be answered, with the chance of their profiting by
it, that comparison confessedly does belong to subjects one in kind, not
to those which differ. No one, for instance, would compare God with man,
or again man with brutes, nor wood with stone, because their natures are
unlike; but God is beyond comparison, and man is compared to man, and
wood to wood, and stone to stone. Now in such cases we should not speak
of ‘better,’ but of ‘rather’ and ‘more;’ thus Joseph was comely rather
than his brethren, and Rachel than Leah; star <span
id="fr_2166"></span>[2167](#fn_2166.md) is not better than star, but is the
rather excellent in glory; whereas in bringing together things which
differ in kind, then ‘better’ is used to mark the difference, as has
been said in the case of wisdom and jewels. Had then the Apostle said,
‘by so much has the Son precedence of the Angels,’ or ‘by so much
greater,’ you would have had a plea, as if the Son were compared with
the Angels; but, as it is, in saying that He is ‘better,’ and differs as
far as Son from servants, the Apostle shews that He is other than the
Angels in nature.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p42"></span><span id="page_340">p. 340</span>
<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-Page_340"></span>(6.) Moreover by saying that He
it is who has ‘laid the foundation of all things <span
id="fr_2167"></span>[2168](#fn_2167.md) ,’ he shews that He is other than
all things originate. But if He be other and different in essence from
their nature, what comparison of His essence can <span
id="fr_2168"></span>[2169](#fn_2168.md) there be, or what likeness to them?
though, even if they have any such thoughts, Paul shall refute them, who
speaks to the very point, ‘For unto which of the Angels said He at any
time, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee? And of the Angels
He saith, Who maketh His Angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of
fire <span id="fr_2169"></span>[2170](#fn_2169.md) .’

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p46"></span>58. Observe here, the word ‘made’
belongs to things originate, and he calls them things made; but to the
Son he speaks not of making, nor of becoming, but of eternity and
kingship, and a Framer’s office, exclaiming, ‘Thy Throne, O God, is for
ever and ever;’ and, ‘Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the
foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Thine hands;
they shall perish, but Thou remainest.’ From which words even they, were
they but willing, might perceive that the Framer is other than things
framed, the former God, the latter things originate, made out of
nothing. For what has been said, ‘They shall perish,’ is said, not as if
the creation were destined for destruction, but to express the nature of
things originate by the issue to which they tend <span
id="fr_2170"></span>[2171](#fn_2170.md) . For things which admit of
perishing, though through the grace <span
id="fr_2171"></span>[2172](#fn_2171.md) of their Maker they perish not, yet
have come out of nothing, and themselves witness that they once were
not. And on this account, since their nature is such, it is said of the
Son, ‘Thou remainest,’ to shew His eternity; for not having the capacity
of perishing, as things originate have, but having eternal duration, it
is foreign to Him to have it said, ‘He was not before His generation,’
but proper to Him to be always, and to endure together with the Father.
And though the Apostle had not thus written in his Epistle to the
Hebrews, still his other Epistles, and the whole of Scripture, would
certainly forbid their entertaining such notions concerning the Word.
But since he has here expressly written it, and, as has been above
shewn, the Son is Offspring of the Father’s essence, and He is Framer,
and other things are framed by Him, and He is the Radiance and Word and
Image and Wisdom of the Father, and things originate stand and serve in
their place below the Triad, therefore the Son is different in kind and
different in essence from things originate, and on the contrary is
proper to the Father’s essence and one in nature with it <span
id="fr_2172"></span>[2173](#fn_2172.md) . And hence it is that the Son too
says not, ‘My Father is better than I <span
id="fr_2173"></span>[2174](#fn_2173.md) ,’ lest we should conceive Him to
be foreign to His Nature, but ‘greater,’ not indeed in greatness, nor in
time, but because of His generation from the Father Himself <span
id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174.md) , nay, in saying ‘greater’ He again
shows that He is proper to His essence.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p52"></span>59. (7). And the Apostle’s own
reason for saying, ‘so much better than the Angels,’ was not any wish in
the first instance to compare the essence <span
id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175.md) of the Word to things originate
(for He cannot be compared, rather they are incommeasurable), but
regarding the Word’s visitation in the flesh, and the Economy which He
then sustained, he wished to show that He was not like those who had
gone before Him; so that, as much as He excelled in nature those who
were sent afore by Him, by so much also the grace which came from and
through Him was better than the ministry through Angels <span
id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176.md) . For it is the function of
servants, to demand the fruits and no more; but of the Son and Master to
forgive the debts and to transfer the vineyard.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p55"></span>(8.) Certainly what the Apostle
proceeds to say shews the excellence of the Son over things originate;
‘Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we
have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. For if the word
spoken by Angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience
received a just recompense of reward; how shall we escape, if we neglect
so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord,
and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him <span
id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177.md) .’ But if the Son were in the
number of things originate, He was not better than they, nor did
disobedience involve increase of punishment because of Him; any more
than in the Ministry of Angels there was not, according to each Angel,
greater or less guilt in the transgressors, but the Law was one, and one
was its vengeance on transgressors. But, whereas the Word is not in the
number of originate things, but is Son of the Father, therefore, as He
Himself is better and His acts better and transcendent, so also the
punishment is worse. Let them contemplate then the grace which is
through the Son, and let them acknowledge the witness which He gives
even from His works, that He is other than things originated, and alone
the very Son in the Father and the Father in Him. <span id="page_341">p.
341</span> <span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-Page_341"></span>And the Law <span
id="fr_2178"></span>[2179](#fn_2178.md) was spoken by Angels, and perfected
no one <span id="fr_2179"></span>[2180](#fn_2179.md) , needing the
visitation of the Word, as Paul hath said; but that visitation has
perfected the work of the Father. And then, from Adam unto Moses death
reigned <span id="fr_2180"></span>[2181](#fn_2180.md) ; but the presence of
the Word abolished death <span id="fr_2181"></span>[2182](#fn_2181.md) .
And no longer in Adam are we all dying <span
id="fr_2182"></span>[2183](#fn_2182.md) ; but in Christ we are all
reviving. And then, from Dan to Beersheba was the Law proclaimed, and in
Judæa only was God known; but now, unto all the earth has gone forth
their voice, and all the earth has been filled with the knowledge of
God <span id="fr_2183"></span>[2184](#fn_2183.md) , and the disciples have
made disciples of all the nations <span
id="fr_2184"></span>[2185](#fn_2184.md) , and now is fulfilled what is
written, ‘They shall be all taught of God <span
id="fr_2185"></span>[2186](#fn_2185.md) .’ And then what was revealed was
but a type; but now the truth has been manifested. And this again the
Apostle himself describes afterwards more clearly, saying, ‘By so much
was Jesus made a surety of a better testament;’ and again, ‘But now hath
He obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also He is the
Mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better
promises.’ And, ‘For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in
of a better hope did.’ And again he says, ‘It was therefore necessary
that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with
these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than
these <span id="fr_2186"></span>[2187](#fn_2186.md) .’ Both in the verse
before us, then, and throughout, does he ascribe the word ‘better’ to
the Lord, who is better and other than originated things. For better is
the sacrifice through Him, better the hope in Him; and also the promises
through Him, not merely as great compared with small, but the one
differing from the other in nature, because He who conducts this
economy, is ‘better’ than things originated.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p66"></span>60. (9.) Moreover the words ‘He is
become surety’ denote the pledge in our behalf which He has provided.
For as, being the ‘Word,’ He ‘became flesh <span
id="fr_2187"></span>[2188](#fn_2187.md) ’ and ‘become’ we ascribe to the
flesh, for it is originated and created, so do we here the expression
‘He is become,’ expounding it according to a second sense, viz. because
He has become man. And let these contentious men know, that they fail in
this their perverse purpose; let them know that Paul does not signify
that His essence <span id="fr_2188"></span>[2189](#fn_2188.md) has become,
knowing, as he did, that He is Son and Wisdom and Radiance and Image of
the Father; but here too he refers the word ‘become’ to the ministry of
that covenant, in which death which once ruled is abolished. Since here
also the ministry through Him has become better, in that ‘what the Law
could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own
Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the
flesh <span id="fr_2189"></span>[2190](#fn_2189.md) ,’ ridding it of the
trespass, in which, being continually held captive, it admitted not the
Divine mind. And having rendered the flesh capable of the Word, He made
us walk, no longer according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit,
and say again and again, ‘But we are not in the flesh but in the
Spirit,’ and, ‘For the Son of God came into the world, not to judge the
world, but to redeem all men, and that the world might be saved through
Him <span id="fr_2190"></span>[2191](#fn_2190.md) .’ Formerly the world, as
guilty, was under judgment from the Law; but now the Word has taken on
Himself the judgment, and having suffered in the body for all, has
bestowed salvation to all <span id="fr_2191"></span>[2192](#fn_2191.md) .
With a view to this has John exclaimed, ‘The law was given by Moses, but
grace and truth came by Jesus Christ <span
id="fr_2192"></span>[2193](#fn_2192.md) .’ Better is grace than the Law,
and truth than the shadow.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p73"></span>61. (10.) ‘Better’ then, as has been
said, could not have been brought to pass by any other than the Son, who
sits on the right hand of the Father. And what does this denote but the
Son’s genuineness, and that the Godhead of the Father is the same as the
Son’s <span id="fr_2193"></span>[2194](#fn_2193.md) ? For in that the Son
reigns in His Father’s kingdom, is seated upon the same throne as the
Father, and is contemplated in the Father’s Godhead, therefore is the
Word God, and whoso beholds the Son, beholds the Father; and thus there
is one God. Sitting then on the right, yet He does not place His Father
on the left <span id="fr_2194"></span>[2195](#fn_2194.md) ; but whatever is
right <span id="fr_2195"></span>[2196](#fn_2195.md) and precious in the
Father, that also the Son has, and says, ‘All things that the Father
hath are Mine <span id="fr_2196"></span>[2197](#fn_2196.md) .’ Wherefore
also the Son, though sitting on the right, also sees the Father on the
right, though it be as become man that He says, ‘I saw the Lord always
before My face, for He is on My right hand, therefore I shall not
fall <span id="fr_2197"></span>[2198](#fn_2197.md) .’ This shews moreover
that the Son is in the Father <span id="page_342">p. 342</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-Page_342"></span>and the Father in the Son; for the
Father being on the right, the Son is on the right; and while the Son
sits on the right of the Father, the Father is in the Son. And the
Angels indeed minister ascending and descending; but concerning the Son
he saith, ‘And let all the Angels of God worship Him <span
id="fr_2198"></span>[2199](#fn_2198.md) .’ And when Angels minister, they
say, ‘I am sent unto thee,’ and, ‘The Lord has commanded;’ but the Son,
though He say in human fashion, ‘I am sent <span
id="fr_2199"></span>[2200](#fn_2199.md) ,’ and comes to finish the work and
to minister, nevertheless says, as being Word and Image, ‘I am in the
Father, and the Father in Me;’ and, ‘He that hath seen Me, hath seen the
Father;’ and, ‘The Father that abideth in Me, He doeth the works <span
id="fr_2200"></span>[2201](#fn_2200.md) ;’ for what we behold in that Image
are the Father’s works.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p82"></span>(11.) What has been already said
ought to shame those persons who are fighting against the very truth;
however, if, because it is written, ‘become better,’ they refuse to
understand ‘become,’ as used of the Son, as ‘has been and is <span
id="fr_2201"></span>[2202](#fn_2201.md) ;’ or again as referring to the
better covenant having come to be <span
id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202.md) , as we have said, but consider
from this expression that the Word is called originate, let them hear
the same again in a concise form, since they have forgotten what has
been said.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p85"></span>62. If the Son be in the number of
the Angels, then let the word ‘become’ apply to Him as to them, and let
Him not differ at all from them in nature; but be they either sons with
Him, or be He an Angel with them; sit they one and all together on the
right hand of the Father, or be the Son standing with them all as a
ministering Spirit, sent forth to minister Himself as they are. But if
on the other hand Paul distinguishes the Son from things originate,
saying, ‘To which of the Angels said He at any time, Thou art My Son?’
and the one frames heaven and earth, but they are made by Him; and He
sitteth with the Father, but they stand by ministering, who does not see
that he has not used the word ‘become’ of the essence of the Word, but
of the ministration come through Him? For as, being the ‘Word,’ He
‘became flesh,’ so when become man, He became by so much better in His
ministry, than the ministry which came by the Angels, as Son excels
servants and Framer things framed. Let them cease therefore to take the
word ‘become’ of the substance of the Son, for He is not one of
originated things; and let them acknowledge that it is indicative of His
ministry and the Economy which came to pass.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p86"></span>(12.) But how He became better in
His ministry, being better in nature than things originate, appears from
what has been said before, which, I consider, is sufficient in itself to
put them to shame. But if they carry on the contest, it will be proper
upon their rash daring to close with them, and to oppose to them those
similar expressions which are used concerning the Father Himself. This
may serve to shame them to refrain their tongue from evil, or may teach
them the depth of their folly. Now it is written, ‘Become my strong rock
and house of defence, that Thou mayest save me <span
id="fr_2203"></span>[2204](#fn_2203.md) .’ And again, ‘The Lord became a
defence for the oppressed <span id="fr_2204"></span>[2205](#fn_2204.md) ,’
and the like which are found in divine Scripture. If then they apply
these passages to the Son, which perhaps is nearest to the truth, then
let them acknowledge that the sacred writers ask Him, as not being
originate, to become to them ‘a strong rock and house of defence;’ and
for the future let them understand ‘become,’ and ‘He made,’ and ‘He
created,’ of His incarnate presence. For then did He become ‘a strong
rock and house of defence,’ when He bore our sins in His own body upon
the tree, and said, ‘Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest <span
id="fr_2205"></span>[2206](#fn_2205.md) .’

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p90"></span>63. But if they refer these passages
to the Father, will they, when it is here also written, ‘Become’ and ‘He
became,’ venture so far as to affirm that God is originate? Yea, they
will dare, as they thus argue concerning His Word; for the course of
their argument carries them on to conjecture the same things concerning
the Father, as they devise concerning His Word. But far be such a notion
ever from the thoughts of all the faithful! for neither is the Son in
the number of things originated, nor do the words of Scripture in
question, ‘Become,’ and ‘He became,’ denote beginning of being, but that
succour which was given to the needy. For God is always, and one and the
same; but men have come to be afterwards through the Word, when the
Father Himself willed it; and God is invisible and inaccessible to
originated things, and especially to men upon earth. When then men in
infirmity invoke Him, when in persecution they ask help, when under
injuries they pray, then the Invisible, being a lover of man, shines
forth upon them with His beneficence, which He exercises through and in
His proper Word. And forthwith the divine manifestation is made to every
one according to his need, and is made to the weak health, and to the
persecuted a ‘refuge’ and ‘house of defence;’ and to the injured He
says, ‘While thou speakest I <span id="page_343">p. 343</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-Page_343"></span>will say, Here I am <span
id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206.md) .’ Whatever defence then comes to
each through the Son, that each says that God has come to be to himself,
since succour comes from God Himself through the Word. Moreover the
usage of men recognises this, and every one will confess its propriety.
Often succour comes from man to man; one has undertaken toil for the
injured, as Abraham for Lot; and another has opened his home to the
persecuted, as Obadiah to the sons of the prophets; and another has
entertained a stranger, as Lot the Angels; and another has supplied the
needy, as Job those who begged of him. And then, should one and the
other of these benefited persons say, ‘Such a one became an assistance
to me,’ and another ‘and to me a refuge,’ and ‘to another a supply,’ yet
in so saying would not be speaking of the original becoming or of the
essence of their benefactors, but of the beneficence coming to
themselves from them; so also when the saints say concerning God, ‘He
became’ and ‘become Thou,’ they do not denote any original becoming, for
God is without beginning and unoriginate, but the salvation which is
made to be unto men from Him.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.xiii-p92"></span>64. This being so understood, it is
parallel also respecting the Son, that whatever, and however often, is
said, such as, ‘He became’ and ‘become,’ should ever have the same
sense: so that as, when we hear the words in question, ‘become better
than the Angels’ and ‘He became,’ we should not conceive any original
becoming of the Word, nor in any way fancy from such terms that He is
originate; but should understand Paul’s words of His ministry and
Economy when He became man. For when ‘the Word became flesh and dwelt
among us <span id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207.md) ’ and came to
minister and to grant salvation to all, then He became to us salvation,
and became life, and became propitiation; then His economy in our behalf
became much better than the Angels, and He became the Way and became the
Resurrection. And as the words ‘Become my strong rock’ do not denote
that the essence of God Himself became, but His lovingkindness, as has
been said, so also here the ‘having become better than the Angels,’ and,
‘He became,’ and, ‘by so much is Jesus become a better surety,’ do not
signify that the essence of the Word is originate (perish the thought!),
but the beneficence which towards us came to be through His becoming
Man; unthankful though the heretics be, and obstinate in behalf of their
irreligion.

heresies concerning the Person of Christ to explain away or deny the
Atonement. The Arians, after the Platonists, insisted on the
pre-existing Priesthood, as if the incarnation and crucifixion were not
of its essence. The Apollinarians resolved the Incarnation into a
manifestation, Theod. *Eran.* i. The Nestorians denied the Atonement,
