<span id="xvi.ii.xxii-p1"></span> 58. There was also a maiden from
Busiris Tripolitana, who had a terrible and very hideous disorder. For
the runnings of her eyes, nose, and ears fell to the ground and
immediately became worms. She was paralysed also and squinted. Her
parents having heard of monks going to Antony, and believing on the Lord
who healed <span id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102.md) the woman with the
issue of blood, asked to be allowed, together with their daughter, to
journey with them. And when they suffered them, the parents together
with the girl, remained outside the mountain with Paphnutius, the
confessor and monk; but the monks went in to Antony. And when they only
wished to tell about the damsel, he anticipated them, and detailed both
the sufferings of the child and how she journeyed with them. Then when
they asked that she should be admitted, Antony did not allow it, but
said, ‘Go, and if she be not dead, you will find her healed: for the
accomplishment of this is not mine, that she should come to me, wretched
man that I am, <span id="page_212">p. 212</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.xxii-Page_212"></span>but her healing is the work of the
Saviour, who in every place sheweth His pity to them that call upon Him.
Wherefore the Lord hath inclined to her as she prayed, and His
loving-kindness hath declared to me that He will heal the child where
she now is.’ So the wonder took place; and going out they found the
parents rejoicing and the girl whole.
