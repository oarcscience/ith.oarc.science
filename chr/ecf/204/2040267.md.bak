<span id="xviii.ii.ii-p1"></span> 2. *The first charge, of setting
Constans against Constantius.*

<span id="xviii.ii.ii-p2"></span>But as to the slanderous charge which
has been preferred against me before your Grace, respecting
correspondence with the most pious Augustus, your brother Constans <span
id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md) , of blessed and everlasting memory
(for my enemies report this of me, and have ventured to assert it in
writing), the former events <span id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287.md)
are sufficient to prove this also to be untrue. Had it been alleged by
another set of persons, the matter would indeed have been a fit subject
of enquiry, but it would have required strong evidence, and open proof
in presence of both parties: but when the same persons who invented the
former charge, are the authors also of this, is it not reasonable to
conclude from the issue of the one, the falsehood of the other? For this
cause they again conferred together in private, thinking to be able to
deceive your Piety before I was aware. But in this they failed: you
would not listen to them as they desired, but patiently gave me an
opportunity to make my defence. And, in that you were not immediately
moved to demand vengeance, you acted only as was righteous in a Prince,
whose duty it is to wait for the defence of the injured party. Which if
you will vouchsafe to hear, I am confident that in this matter also you
will condemn those reckless men, who have no fear of that God, who has
commanded us not to speak falsely before the king <span
