<span id="vii.ii.iii-p1"></span> §3. *The true doctrine. Creation out of
nothing, of God’s lavish bounty of being. Man created above the rest,
but incapable of independent perseverance. Hence the exceptional and
supra-natural gift of being in God’s Image, with the promise of bliss
conditionally upon his perseverance in grace.*

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p2"></span>Thus do they vainly speculate. But the
godly teaching and the faith according to Christ brands their foolish
language as godlessness. For it knows that it was not spontaneously,
because forethought is not absent; nor of existing matter, because God
is not weak; but that out of nothing, and without its having any
previous existence, God made the universe to exist through His word, as
He says firstly through Moses: “In <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) the beginning God created the heaven
and the earth;” secondly, in the most edifying book of the Shepherd,
“First <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) of all believe that God
is one, which created and framed all things, and made them to exist out
of nothing.” 2. To which also Paul refers when he says, “By <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) faith we understand that the worlds
have been framed by the Word of God, so that what is seen hath not been
made out of things which do appear.” 3. For God is good, or rather is
essentially the source of goodness: nor <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) could one that is good be niggardly of
anything: whence, grudging existence to none, He has made all things out
of nothing by His own Word, Jesus Christ our Lord. And among these,
having taken especial pity, above all things on earth, upon the race of
men, and having perceived its inability, by virtue of the condition of
its origin, to continue in one stay, He gave them a further gift, and He
did not barely create man, as He did all the irrational creatures on the
earth, but made them after His own image, giving them a portion even of
the power of His own Word; so that having as it were a kind of reflexion
of the Word, and being made rational, they might be able to abide ever
in blessedness, living the true life which belongs to the saints in
paradise. 4. But knowing once more how the will of man could <span
id="page_38">p. 38</span> <span id="vii.ii.iii-Page_38"></span>sway to
either side, in anticipation He secured the grace given them by a law
and by the spot where He placed them. For He brought them into His own
garden, and gave them a law: so that, if they kept the grace and
remained good, they might still keep the life in paradise without sorrow
or pain or care besides having the promise of incorruption in heaven;
but that if they transgressed and turned back, and became evil, they
might know that they were incurring that corruption in death which was
theirs by nature: no longer to live in paradise, but cast out of it from
that time forth to die and to abide in death and in corruption. 5. Now
this is that of which Holy Writ also gives warning, saying in the Person
of God: “Of every tree <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) that is
in the garden, eating thou shalt eat: but of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, ye shall not eat of it, but on the day that ye eat,
dying ye shall die.” But by “dying ye shall die,” what else could be
meant than not dying merely, but also abiding ever in the corruption of
death?

[Next: Our creation and God's Incarnation most intimately connected. As
by the Word man was called from non-existence into being, and further
received the grace of a divine life, so by the one fault which forfeited
that life they again incurred corruption and untold sin and misery
filled the world.](2040101.md)
