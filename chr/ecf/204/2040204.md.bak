<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—<span class="c10"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p1.2"></span>Authorities in Support of the Council</span>.
*Theognostus; Dionysius of Alexandria; Dionysius of Rome; Origen.*

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p2"></span>25. <span class="c10"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p2.1"></span>This</span> then is the sense in which they
who met at Nicæa made use of these expressions. But next that they did
not invent them for themselves (since this is one of their excuses), but
spoke what they had received from their predecessors, proceed we to
prove this also, to cut off even this excuse from them. Know then, O
Arians, foes of Christ, that Theognostus <span
id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md) , a learned man, did not decline the
phrase ‘of the essence,’ for in the second book of his Hypotyposes, he
writes thus of the Son:—

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p4"></span>“The essence of the Son is not one
procured <span id="page_167">p. 167</span> <span
id="xiv.ii.vi-Page_167"></span>from without, nor accruing out of
nothing <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md) , but it sprang from the
Father’s essence, as the radiance of light, as the vapour <span
id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md) of water; for neither the radiance,
nor the vapour, is the water itself or the sun itself, nor is it alien;
but it is an effluence of the Father’s essence, which, however, suffers
no partition. For as the sun remains the same, and is not impaired by
the rays poured forth by it, so neither does the Father’s essence suffer
change, though it has the Son as an Image of Itself <span
id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md) .”

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p8"></span>Theognostus then, after previously
investigating in the way of an exercise <span
id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925.md) , proceeds to lay down his sentiments
in the foregoing words. Next, Dionysius, who was Bishop of Alexandria,
upon his writing against Sabellius and expounding at large the Saviour’s
Economy according to the flesh, and thence proving against the
Sabellians that not the Father but His Word became flesh, as John has
said, was suspected of saying that the Son as a thing made and
originated, and not one in essence with the Father; on this he writes to
his namesake Dionysius, Bishop of Rome, to allege in his defence that
this was a slander upon him. And he assured him that he had not called
the Son made, nay, did confess Him to be even one in essence. And his
words ran thus:—

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p10"></span>“And I have written in another letter a
refutation of the false charge they bring against me, that I deny that
Christ was one in essence with God. For though I say that I have not
found this term anywhere in Holy Scripture, yet my remarks which follow,
and which they have not noticed, are not inconsistent with that belief.
For I instanced human birth as being evidently homogeneous, and I
observed that undeniably parents differed from their children only in
not being the same individuals, otherwise there could be neither parents
nor children. And my letter, as I said before, owing to present
circumstances I am unable to produce; or I would have sent you the very
words I used, or rather a copy of it all, which, if I have an
opportunity, I will do still. But I am sure from recollection that I
adduced parallels of things kindred with each other; for instance, that
a plant grown from seed or from root, was other than that from which it
sprang, yet was altogether one in nature with it <span
id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926.md) : and that a stream flowing from a
fountain, gained a new name, for that neither the fountain was called
stream, nor the stream fountain, and both existed, and the stream was
the water from the fountain”

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p12"></span>26. And that the Word of God is not a
work or creature, but an offspring proper to the Father’s essence and
indivisible, as the great Council wrote, here you may see in the words
of Dionysius, Bishop of Rome, who, while writing against the Sabellians,
thus inveighs against those who dared to say so:—

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p13"></span>“Next, I may reasonably turn to those
who divide and cut to pieces and destroy that most sacred doctrine of
the Church of God, the Divine Monarchy <span
id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927.md) , making it as it were three powers
and partitive subsistences <span id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928.md) and
god-heads three. I am told that some among you who are catechists and
teachers of the Divine Word, take the lead in this tenet, who are
diametrically opposed, so to speak, to Sabellius’s opinions; for he
blasphemously says that the Son is the Father, and the Father the Son,
but they in some sort preach three Gods, as dividing the sacred Monad
into three subsistences foreign to each other and utterly separate. For
it must needs be that with the God of the Universe, the Divine Word is
united, and the Holy Ghost must repose <span
id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929.md) and habitate in God; thus in one as in
a summit, I mean the God of the Universe, must the Divine Triad <span
id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930.md) be gathered up and brought together.
<span id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span
id="xiv.ii.vi-Page_168"></span>For it is the doctrine of the
presumptuous Marcion, to sever and divide the Divine Monarchy into three
origins,—a devil’s teaching, not that of Christ’s true disciples and
lovers of the Saviour’s lessons. For they know well that a Triad is
preached by divine Scripture, but that neither Old Testament nor New
preaches three Gods. Equally must one censure those who hold the Son to
be a work, and consider that the Lord has come into being, as one of
things which really came to be; whereas the divine oracles witness to a
generation suitable to Him and becoming, but not to any fashioning or
making. A blasphemy then is it, not ordinary, but even the highest, to
say that the Lord is in any sort a handiwork. For if He came to be Son,
once He was not; but He was always, if (that is) He be in the Father, as
He says Himself, and if the Christ be Word and Wisdom and Power (which,
as ye know, divine Scripture says), and these attributes be powers of
God. If then the Son came into being, once these attributes were not;
consequently there was a time, when God was without them; which is most
absurd. And why say more on these points to you, men full of the Spirit
and well aware of the absurdities which come to view from saying that
the Son is a work? Not attending, as I consider, to this circumstance,
the authors of this opinion have entirely missed the truth, in
explaining, contrary to the sense of divine and prophetic Scripture in
the passage, the words, ‘The Lord created me a beginning of His ways
unto His works <span id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931.md) .’ For the sense
of ‘He created,’ as ye know, is not one, for we must understand ‘He
created’ in this place, as ‘He set over the works made by Him,’ that is,
‘made by the Son Himself.’ And ‘He created’ here must not be taken for
‘made,’ for creating differs from making. ‘Is not He thy Father that
hath bought thee? hath He not made thee and created thee <span
id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932.md) ?’says Moses in his great song in
Deuteronomy. And one may say to them, O reckless men, is He a work, who
is ‘the First-born of every creature, who is born from the womb before
the morning star <span id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933.md) ,’ who said, as
Wisdom, ‘Before all the hills He begets me <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934.md) ?’ And in many passages of the divine
oracles is the Son said to have been <span
id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935.md) generated, but nowhere to have <span
id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936.md) come into being; which manifestly
convicts those of misconception about the Lord’s generation, who presume
to call His divine and ineffable generation a making <span
id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937.md) . Neither then may we divide into
three Godheads the wonderful and divine Monad; nor disparage with the
name of ‘work’ the dignity and exceeding majesty of the Lord; but we
must believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Christ Jesus His Son,
and in the Holy Ghost, and hold that to the God of the universe the Word
is united <span id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938.md) . For ‘I,’ says He,
‘and the Father are one;’ and, ‘I in the Father and the Father in Me.’
For thus both the Divine Triad, and the holy preaching of the Monarchy,
will be preserved.”

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p26"></span>27. And concerning the everlasting
co-existence of the Word with the Father, and that He is not of another
essence or subsistence, but proper to the Father’s, as the Bishops in
the Council said, you may hear again from the labour-loving <span
id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939.md) Origen also. For what he has written
as if inquiring and by way of exercise, that let no one take as
expressive of his own sentiments, but of parties who are contending in
investigation, but what he <span id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940.md)
definitely declares, that is the sentiment of the labour-loving man.
After his prolusions then (so to speak) against the heretics,
straightway he introduces his personal belief, thus:—

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p29"></span>“If there be an Image of the Invisible
God, it is an invisible Image; nay, I will be bold to add, that, as
being the likeness of the Father, never was it not. For when was that
God, who, according to John, is called Light (for ‘God is Light’),
without a radiance of His proper glory, that a man should presume to
assert the Son’s origin of existence, as if before He was not? But when
was not that Image of the Father’s Ineffable and Nameless and
Unutterable subsistence, that Expression and Word, and He that knows the
Father? for let him understand well who dares to say, ‘Once the Son was
not,’ that he is saying, ‘Once Wisdom was not,’ and ‘Word was not,’ and
‘Life was not.’”

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p30"></span>And again elsewhere he says:—

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p31"></span>“But it is not innocent nor without
peril, if because of our weakness of understanding we deprive God, as
far as in us lies, of the Only-begotten Word ever co-existing with Him;
and the Wisdom in which He rejoiced; else He must be conceived as not
always possessed of joy.”

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p32"></span>See, we are proving that this view has
been transmitted from father to father; but ye, O modern Jews and
disciples of Caiaphas, how many fathers can ye assign to your phrases?
Not one of the understanding and wise; for all abhor you, but the devil
alone <span id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941.md) ; none but he is your
father in this apostasy, who both in the beginning sowed you with the
seed of this <span id="page_169">p. 169</span> <span
id="xiv.ii.vi-Page_169"></span>irreligion, and now persuades you to
slander the Ecumenical Council <span id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942.md) ,
for committing to writing, not your doctrines, but that which from the
beginning those who were eye-witnesses and ministers of the Word have
handed down to us <span id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943.md) . For the
faith which the Council has confessed in writing, that is the faith of
the Catholic Church; to assert this, the blessed Fathers so expressed
themselves while condemning the Arian heresy; and this is a chief reason
why these apply themselves to calumniate the Council. For it is not the
terms which trouble them <span id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944.md) , but
that those terms prove them to be heretics, and presumptuous beyond
other heresies.

id="xiv.ii.vi-p2.2"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p3"></span> Athanasius elsewhere calls him ‘the
admirable and excellent.’ *ad Serap.* iv. 9. He was Master of the
Catechetical school of Alexandria towards the end of the third century,
being a scholar, or at least a follower of Origen. His seven books of
Hypotyposes treated of the Holy Trinity, of angels, and evil spirits, of
the Incarnation, and the Creation. Photius, who gives this account, Cod.
106, accuses him of heterodoxy on these points; which Athanasius in a
measure admits, as far as the wording of his treatise went, when he
speaks of his ‘investigating by way of exercise.’ Eusebius does not
mention him at all. \[His remains in Routh, *Rell.* iii. 409–414.\]

<span id="fn_922"></span>[167:923](2040204.htm#fr_922.md) <span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p5"></span> Vid. above §15. fin. ‘God was alone,’
says Tertullian, ‘because there was nothing external to Him,
*extrinsecus;* yet not even then alone, for He had with Him, what He had
in Himself, His Reason.’ in *Prax.* 5. Non per adoptionem spiritus
filius fit *extrinsecus,* sed naturâ filius est. Origen. *Periarch.* i.
2. n. 4.

and so Origen, *Periarch.* i. 2. n. 5. and 9. and Athan. *de Sent.
Dionys.* 15.

<span id="fn_924"></span>[167:925](2040204.htm#fr_924.md) <span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p6.3"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p7"></span> It is sometimes erroneously supposed
that such illustrations as this are intended to *explain* how the Sacred
Mystery in question is possible, whereas they are merely intended to
shew that the words we use concerning it are not *self-contradictory,*
which is the objection most commonly brought against them. To say that
the doctrine of the Son’s generation does not intrench upon the Father’s
perfection and immutability, or negative the Son’s eternity, seems at
first sight inconsistent with what the words Father and Son mean, till
another image is adduced, such as the sun and radiance, in which that
alleged inconsistency is seen to exist in fact. Here one image corrects
another; and the accumulation of images is not, as is often thought, the
restless and fruitless effort of the mind to *enter into the Mystery,*
but is a *safeguard* against any one image, nay, any collection of
images being supposed *sufficient.* If it be said that the language used
concerning the sun and its radiance is but popular not philosophical, so
again the Catholic language concerning the Holy Trinity may, nay must
be, economical, not adequate, conveying the truth, not in the tongues of
angels, but under human modes of thought and speech.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[167:926](2040204.htm#fr_925.md) <span

of Origen, <span class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p9.3"></span>ξητῶν

speaks of altercation, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p9.5"></span>φυσικῆς τινος γυμνασίας ἕνεκα</span>. Socr.
i. 7. In somewhat a similar way, Athanasius speaks of Dionysius writing
<span class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p9.7"></span>κατ᾽
οἰκονομίαν</span>, economically, or with reference to certain persons
addressed or objects contemplated, *de Sent.* D. 6. and 26.

<span id="fn_926"></span>[167:927](2040204.htm#fr_926.md) <span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p11"></span> The Arians at Nicæa objected to this
image, *Socr.* i. 8. as implying that the Son was a <span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p11.2"></span>προβολὴ</span>, issue or
development, as Valentinus taught. Epiph. *Hær*. 69. 7. Athanasius
elsewhere uses it himself.

<span id="fn_927"></span>[167:928](2040204.htm#fr_927.md) <span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p14"></span> By the Monarchy is meant the doctrine
that the Second and Third Persons in the Ever-blessed Trinity are ever
to be referred in our thoughts to the First as the Fountain of Godhead,
vid. §15. note 9, and §19, note 6. It is one of the especial senses in
which God is said to be one. Cf. *Orat*. iii. §15. vid. also iv. §1.
‘The Father is *union,* <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p14.2"></span>ἕ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p14.3"></span>νωσις</span>,’ says S. Greg. Naz. ‘from whom
and unto whom are the others.’ *Orat*. 42. 15. also *Orat*. 20. 7. and
Epiph. *Hær*. 57. 5. Tertullian, before Dionysius, uses the word
Monarchia, which Praxeas had perverted into a kind of Unitarianism or
Sabellianism, in *Prax.* 3. Irenæus too wrote on the Monarchy, i.e.
against the doctrine that God is the author of evil. Eus. *Hist.* v. 20.
\[see S. Iren. *fragment* 33, Ante-Nic. Lib.\] And before him was
Justin’s work *de Monarchia,* where the word is used in opposition to
Polytheism. The Marcionites, whom Dionysius presently mentions, are also
specified in the above extract by Athan. vid. also Cyril. *Hier. Cat.*
xvi. 3. Epiphanius says that their three origins were God, the Creator,
and the evil spirit. *Hær*. 42, 3. or as Augustine says, the good, the
just, and the wicked, which may be taken to mean nearly the same thing.
*Hær*. 22. The Apostolical Canons denounce those who baptize into Three
Unoriginate; vid. also Athan. Tom. *ad Antioch*. 5. Naz. *Orat*. 20. 6.
Basil denies <span class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p14.5"></span>τρεῖς
ἀρχικαὶ ὑποστάσεις</span>, *de Sp. S.* 38. which is a Platonic phrase.

<span id="fn_928"></span>[167:929](2040204.htm#fr_928.md) <span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p14.7"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p15"></span> And so Dionysius Alex. in a fragment
preserved by S. Basil, ‘If because the subsistences are three, they say
that they are partitive, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p15.2"></span>μεμερισμένας</span>, still three there are,
though these persons dissent, or they utterly destroy the Divine
Trinity.’ *de Sp. S.* n. 72. Athan. expresses the same more distinctly,
<span class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p15.4"></span>οὐ τρεῖς
ὑποστάσεις μεμερισμένας</span>, Expos. *Fid.* §2. In S. Greg. Naz. we
find <span class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p15.6"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p15.7"></span>μέριστος ἐν
μεμερισμένοις ἡ θεότης</span>. *Orat.* 31. 14. Elsewhere for <span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p15.9"></span>μεμ</span>. he
substitutes <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p15.10"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p15.11"></span>πεῤ& 191·ηγμένας</span>. *Orat.* 20. 6.

class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p15.14"></span>πεξενωμένας ἀλλήλων καὶ

id="xiv.ii.vi-p15.16"></span>ξένας ἀλλήλων παντάπασι

controversy about the <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p15.18"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p15.19"></span>ξ ὑποστάσεως ἢ οὐσίας</span> of the Nicene
Creed, of which infr. on the Creed itself in Eusebius’s Letter.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[167:930](2040204.htm#fr_929.md) <span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p15.21"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p16"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p16.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p16.2"></span>μφιλοχωρεῖν</span>

<span id="fn_930"></span>[167:931](2040204.htm#fr_930.md) <span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p16.3"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p17"></span> The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p17.2"></span>τριὰς</span>, usually translated Trinity, is
first used by Theophilus, *ad Autol.* ii. 15. Gibbon remarks that the
doctrine of ‘a numerical rather than a generical unity,’ which has been
explicitly put forth by the Latin Church, is favoured by the Latin
language; <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p17.4"></span>τριὰς</span> seems to excite the idea of
substance, *trinitas* of qualities.’ ch. 21. note 74. It is certain that
the Latin view of the sacred truth, when perverted, becomes
Sabellianism; and that the Greek, when perverted, becomes Arianism; and
we find Arius arising in the East, Sabellius in the West. It is also
certain that the word Trinitas is properly abstract; and expresses <span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p17.6"></span>τριὰς</span> or ‘a
three,’ only in an ecclesiastical sense. But Gibbon does not seem to
observe that Unitas is abstract as well as Trinitas; and that we might
just as well say in consequence, that the Latins held an abstract unity
or a unity of qualities, while the Greeks by <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p17.8"></span>μονὰς</span> taught the doctrine of ‘a one’
or a numerical unity. ‘Singularitatem hanc dico (says S. Ambrose), quod
Græce <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p17.10"></span>μονότης</span> dicitur; singularitas ad
personam pertinet, unitas ad naturam.’ *de Fid.* v. 1. It is important,
however, to understand, that ‘Trinity’ does not mean the *state* or
*condition* of being three, as humanity is the condition of being man,
but is synonymous with *three persons.* Humanity does not exist and
cannot be addressed, but the Holy Trinity is a three, or a unity which
exists in three. Apparently from not considering this, Luther and Calvin
objected to the word Trinity, ‘It is a common prayer,’ says Calvin:
‘Holy Trinity, one God, have mercy on us. It displeases me, and savours
throughout of barbarism.’ *Ep. ad Polon.* p. 796.

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p25"></span> This extract discloses to us (in
connexion with the passages from Dionysius Alex. here and in the *de
Sent. D.*) a remarkable anticipation of the Arian controversy in the
third century. 1. It appears that the very symbol of <span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.2"></span>ἦ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.3"></span>ν ὅτε οὐκ ἦν</span>,
‘once He was not,’ was asserted or implied; vid. also the following
extract from Origen, §27. and Origen *Periarchon,* iv. 28. where mention
is also made of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.5"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.6"></span>ξ οὐκ ὄντων</span>, ‘out of nothing,’ which
was the Arian symbol in opposition to ‘of the substance.’ Allusions are
made besides, to ‘the Father not being always Father,’ *de Sent. D.* 15.
and ‘the Word being brought to be by the true Word, and Wisdom by the
true Wisdom;’ ibid. 25. 2. The same special text is used in defence of
the heresy, and that not at first sight an obvious one, which is found
among the Arians, <span id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.8"></span>[Prov. viii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.10"></span>.
3. The same texts were used by the Catholics, which occur in the Arian
controversy. e.g. [Deut. 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006.md), [Prov.
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md), [Ps.
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md), [Prov.
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#025.md), [John
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md), [John
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010.md)<span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.12"></span>[Deut. xxxii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006.md)<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.14"></span>.
against [Prov. viii. 22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)<span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.15"></span>. and such as [Ps. cx.
3](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003.md)<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.16"></span>.
[Prov. viii. 25](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#025.md)<span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.17"></span>. and the two [John x.
30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md)<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.18"></span>.
and xiv. 10. 4. The same Catholic symbols and statements are found, e.g.
‘begotten not made,’ ‘one in essence,’ ‘Trinity,’ <span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.20"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p25.21"></span>διαίρετον, ἄναρχον,
ἀειγενες</span>, ‘light from light,’ &c. Much might be said on this
circumstance, as forming part of the proof of the very early date of the
development and formation of the Catholic theology, which we are at
first sight apt to ascribe to the 4th and 5th centuries. \[But see

so styles itself in the opening of its Synodical Letter.

id="xiv.ii.vi-p34.5"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p35"></span> The profession under which the decrees
of Councils come to us is that of setting forth in writing what has ever
been held orally or implicitly in the Church. Hence the frequent use of
such phrases as <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p35.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p35.3"></span>γγραφῶς ἐξετέθη</span> with reference to
them. Thus Damasus, Theod. *H. E.* v. 10. speaks of that ‘apostolical
faith, which was *set forth in writing* by the Fathers in Nicæa.’ On the
other hand, Ephrem of Antioch speaks of the doctrine of our Lord’s
perfect humanity being ‘inculcated by our Holy Fathers, but not as yet
\[i.e. till the Council of Chalcedon\] being *confirmed* by the decree
of an ecumenical Council.’ *Phot.* 229. p. 801. (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p35.5"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.vi-p35.6"></span>γγραφῶς</span>, however,
sometimes relates to the act of subscribing; Phot. *ibid.* or to
Scripture, Clement. *Strom.* i. init. p. 321.) Hence Athan. says *ad
Afros.* 1. and 2. that ‘the Word of the Lord which was given through the
ecumenical Council in Nicæa *remaineth for ever;*’ and uses against its
opposers the texts, ‘Remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers
have set’ (vid. also Dionysius in Eus. *H. E.* vii. 7.), and ‘He that
curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death.’ [Prov.
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#028.md), [Exod.
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#017.md)<span
id="xiv.ii.vi-p35.8"></span>. vid. also Athan. *ad Epict.* 1. And the
Council of Chalcedon professes to ‘drive away the doctrines of error by
a common decree, and *renew* the unswerving faith of the Fathers,’ [Act.
v.](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#000.md)<span id="xiv.ii.vi-p35.10"></span>
p. 452. \[t. iv. 1453 ed. Col.\] ‘as,’ they proceed, ‘from of old the
prophets spoke of Christ, and He Himself instructed us, and the creed of
the Fathers has delivered to us,’ whereas ‘other faith it is not lawful
for any to bring forth, or to write, or to draw up, or to hold, or to
teach.’ p. 456. \[1460 ed. Col.\] vid. S. Leo. supr. p. 5. note m. This,
however, did not interfere with their *adding* without *undoing.* ‘For,’
says Vigilius, ‘if it were unlawful to receive aught further after the
Nicene statutes, on what authority venture we to assert that the Holy
Ghost is of one substance with the Father, which it is notorious was
there omitted?’ *contr. Eutych.* v. init.; he gives other instances,
some in point, others not. vid. also Eulogius, *apud Phot. Cod.* 23. pp.
829. 853. Yet to add to the *confession* of the Church is not to add to
the *faith,* since nothing can be added to the faith. Leo, *Ep.* 124. p.
1237. Nay, Athan. says that the Nicene faith is sufficient to refute
every heresy, *ad Max.* 5. fin. (also Leo. *Ep.* 54. p. 956. and Naz.
*Ep.* 102. init.) *excepting, however,* the doctrine of the Holy Spirit;
which explains his meaning. The Henoticon of Zeno says the same, but
with the intention of dealing a blow at the Council of Chalcedon. Evagr.
iii. 14. p. 345. Aetius at Chalcedon says that at Ephesus and Chalcedon
the Fathers did not profess to draw up an exposition of faith, and that
Cyril and Leo did but *interpret the Creed.* Conc. t. 2. p. 428. \[t.
iv. 1430, 1431 ed. Col. See this whole subject very amply treated in Dr.
Pusey’s *On the Clause, And the Son,* pp. 76 sqq.\] Leo even says that
the Apostles’ Creed is sufficient against all heresies, and that
Eutyches erred on a point ‘of which our Lord wished no one of either sex
in the Church to be ignorant,’ and he wishes Eutyches to take the
plentitude of the Creed ‘puro et simplici corde.’ *Ep.* 31. p. 857, 8.
