<span id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p1"></span> §34. *Prophecies of His passion and
death in all its circumstances.*

<span id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p2"></span>Nor is even His death passed over in
silence: on the contrary, it is referred to in the divine Scriptures,
even exceeding clearly. For to the end that none should err for want of
instruction in the actual events, they feared not to mention even the
cause of His death,—that He suffers it not for His own sake, but for the
immortality and salvation of all, and the counsels of the Jews against
Him and the indignities offered Him at their hands. 2. They say then: “A
man <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286) in stripes, and knowing how
to bear weakness, for his face is turned away: he was dishonoured and
held in no account. He beareth our sins, and is in pain on our account;
and we reckoned him to be in labour, and in stripes, and in ill-usage;
but he was wounded for our sins, and made weak for our wickedness. The
chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his stripes we were
healed.” O marvel at the loving-kindness of the Word, that for our sakes
He is dishonoured, that we may be brought to honour. “For all we,” it
says, “like sheep were gone astray; man had erred in his way; and the
Lord delivered him for our sins; and he openeth not his mouth, because
he hath been evilly entreated. As a sheep was he brought to the
slaughter, and as a lamb dumb before his shearer, so openeth he not his
mouth: in his abasement his judgment was taken away <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287) .” 3. Then lest any should from His
suffering conceive Him to be a common man, Holy Writ anticipates the
surmises of man, and declares the power (which worked) for Him <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288) , and the difference of His nature
compared with ourselves, saying: “But who shall declare his generation?
For his life is taken away <span id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289) from
the earth. From the wickedness of the people was he brought to death.
And I will give the wicked instead of his burial, and the rich instead
of his death; for he did no wickedness, neither was guile found in his
mouth. And the Lord will cleanse him from his stripes.”

<span id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.1"></span>τὴν ὑπὲρ αὐτου δύναμιν</span>. The Ben.

class="Greek"><span id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.3"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.4"></span>περ</span>. Mr. E. N.
Bennett has suggested to me that the true reading may be <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.6"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.7"></span>περά& 203·λον</span>

id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.13"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.14"></span>περαὺλως</span> in Philo). I would add
the suggestion that <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.16"></span>αὐτοῦ</span> stood after <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.18"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.19"></span>περάυλον</span>, and
that the similarity of the five letters in <span class="c10"><span
id="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.21"></span>ms.</span> caused the second word to be
dropped out. *‘His* exceeding immaterial power’ would be the resulting
sense. (See Class. Review, 1890, No. iv. p. 182.)
