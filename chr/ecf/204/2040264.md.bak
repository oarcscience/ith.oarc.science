<span id="xviii.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xviii.i-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xviii.i-p3.1"></span>This</span> address to the Emperor in defence
against certain serious charges (see below) was completed about the time
of the intrusion of George, who arrived at Alexandria on Feb. 24, 357.
The main, or apologetic, part of the letter was probably composed before
George’s actual arrival, in fact at about the same date as the
encyclical letter which immediately precedes; §§27 and following (see
27, note 2) forming an added expostulation upon hearing of the general
expulsion of Catholic Bishops, and of the outrages <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279.md) at Alexandria. It is quite
uncertain whether it ever reached the emperor; whether it did so or not,
his attitude toward Athanasius was in no way affected by it. It had
probably been begun with the idea of its being actually delivered in the
presence of Constantius (see §§3, 6, 8, 16 ‘I see you smile,’ 22), but,
although by a rhetorical fiction the form of an oral defence is kept up
to the end, the concluding sections (27, 32 *init*.) shew that any such
idea had been renounced before the Apology was completed. The first 26
sections are directed to the refutation of four personal charges, quite
different from those of the earlier period, rebutted in the Apology
against the Arians. They were (1) that Athanasius had poisoned the mind
of Constans against his brother (2–5). To this Ath. replies that he had
never spoken to the deceased Augustus except in the presence of
witnesses, and that the history of his own movements when in the West
entirely precluded any such possibility. The third and fourth sections
thus incidentally supply important details for the life of Athanasius.
(2) That he had written letters to the ‘tyrant’ Magnentius (6–13), a
charge absurd in itself, and only to be borne out by forgery, but also
amply disproved by his known affection toward Constans, the victim of
the ‘tyrant.’ (3) That he had (14–18) used the new church in the
‘Cæsareum,’ before it was completed or dedicated, for the Easter
festival of 355 (Tillem. viii. 149). This Athanasius admits, but pleads
necessity and precedent, adding that no disrespect was intended toward
the donor, nor any anticipation of its formal consecration. (4) That he
had disobeyed an imperial order to leave Alexandria and go to Italy
(19–26, see esp. 19, n. 4, and *Fest. Ind.* xxvi. Constantius is at
Milan July 21, 353—Gwatkin p. 292). This charge involves the whole
history of the attempts to dislodge Athanasius from Alexandria, which
culminated in the events of 356. He replies to the charge, that the
summons in question had come in the form of an invitation in reply to an
alleged letter of his own asking leave to go to Italy, a letter which,
as his amanuenses would testify, he had never written. Of the later
visit (355, *Fest. Ind.* xxvii.) of Diogenes, he merely says that
Diogenes brought neither letter nor orders. Syrianus, he seems to allow,
had verbally ordered him to Italy (Constantius was again at
Milan,—Gwatkin *ubi supra*) but without written authority. As against
these supposed orders, Ath. had a letter from the emperor (§23)
exhorting him to remain at Alexandria, whatever reports he might hear.
Syrianus had, at the urgent remonstrance of the clergy and people,
consented to refer the matter back to Constantius (24), but without
waiting to do this, he had suddenly made his famous night attack upon
the bishop when holding a vigil service in the Church of Theonas.
Thereupon Athanasius had set out for Italy to lay the matter before the
emperor in person (27 *init.*). But on reaching, as it would seem, the
Libyan portion of his Province, he was turned back by the news of the
Council of Milan, and the wholesale banishment which followed. Here we
pass to the second part of the Apology. He explains his return to the
desert by the three reports which had reached him: first, that just
mentioned; secondly, that of further military outrages, about Easter 356
(or possibly those of George in 357, see *Apol. Fug.* 6; the clear
statements of *Fest. Ind.* and *Hist. Aceph.* compel us <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280.md) to place these in the latter year,
<span id="page_237">p. 237</span> <span
id="xviii.i-Page_237"></span>although on *à priori* grounds we might
have followed Tillem., Bright, &c., in placing them in 356), and of the
nomination of George; thirdly, of the letters of Constantius to the
Alexandrians and to the Princes of Abyssinia. He had accordingly gone
into hiding, in fear, not of the Emperor, but of the violence of his
officers, and as of bounden duty to all (32). He concludes with an
outspoken denunciation of the treatment of the virgins, and by an urgent
entreaty to Constantius ‘which supposes the imperial listener to be
already more than half appeased’ (Bright). The Apology is the most
carefully written work of Athanasius, and ‘has been justly praised for
its artistic finish and its rhetorical skill’ as well as for the force
and the sustained calmness and dignity of its diction. (So Montfaucon,
Newman, Gwatkin, &c. Fialon, pp. 286, 292, gives some interesting
examples of apparent imitation of Demosthenes in this and in the two
following tracts.) But the violent contrast between its almost
affectionate respectfulness and the chilly reserve of the *Apol. pro
Fuga*, or still more the furious invective of the Arian History, is
startling, and gives a *prima facie* justification to Gibbon, who (vol.
3, p. 87, Smith’s Ed.) charges the great bishop with simulating respect
to the emperor’s face while denouncing him behind his back. But although
the *de Fuga* (see introd. there) was written very soon after our
present Apology, there is no ground for making them simultaneous, while
its tone (see *Ap. Fug.* 26, note 7) is very different from that of the
later *Hist. Arian.* Doubtless much of the material for the invectives
of the latter was already ancient history when the tract before us was
composed. But Constantius was the Emperor, the first personage in the
Christian world, and Athanasius with the feeling of his age, with the
memory of the solemn assurances he had received from the Emperor (§§23,
25, 27, *Apol. Ar.* 51–56, *Hist. Ar.* 21–24), would ‘hope all things,’
even ‘against hope,’ so long as there was any apparent chance of
influencing Constantius for good; would hope in spite of all appearances
that the outrages, banishments, and intrigues against the faith of Nicæa
were the work of the officers, the Arian bishops, the eunuchs of the
Court, and not of ‘Augustus’ himself (see Bright, Introd. to this
Apology, pp. lxiii.–lxv.).
