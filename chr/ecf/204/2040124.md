<span id="vii.ii.xxvii-p1"></span> §27. *The change wrought by the Cross
in the relation of Death to Man.*

<span id="vii.ii.xxvii-p2"></span>For that death is destroyed, and that
the Cross is become the victory over it, and that it has no more power
but is verily dead, this is no small proof, or rather an evident
warrant, that it is despised by all Christ’s disciples, and that they
all take the aggressive against it and no longer fear it; but by the
sign of the Cross and by faith in Christ tread <span id="page_51">p.
51</span> <span id="vii.ii.xxvii-Page_51"></span>it down as dead. 2. For
of old, before the divine sojourn of the Saviour took place, even to the
saints death was terrible <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275) , and
all wept for the dead as though they perished. But now that the Saviour
has raised His body, death is no longer terrible; for all who believe in
Christ tread him under as nought, and choose rather to die than to deny
their faith in Christ. For they verily know that when they die they are
not destroyed, but actually \[begin to\] live, and become incorruptible
through the Resurrection. 3. And that devil that once maliciously
exulted in death, now that its <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276)
pains were loosed, remained the only one truly dead. And a proof of this
is, that before men believe Christ, they see in death an object of
terror, and play the coward before him. But when they are gone over to
Christ’s faith and teaching, their contempt for death is so great that
they even eagerly rush upon it, and become witnesses for the
Resurrection the Saviour has accomplished against it. For while still
tender in years they make haste to die, and not men only, but women
also, exercise themselves by bodily discipline against it. So weak has
he become, that even women who were formerly deceived by him, now mock
at him as dead and paralyzed. 4. For as when a tyrant has been defeated
by a real king, and bound hand and foot, then all that pass by laugh him
to scorn, buffeting and reviling him, no longer fearing his fury and
barbarity, because of the king who has conquered him; so also, death
having been conquered and exposed by the Saviour on the Cross, and bound
hand and foot, all they who are in Christ, as they pass by, trample on
him, and witnessing to Christ scoff at death, jesting at him, and saying
what has been written against him of old: “O death <span
id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277) , where is thy victory? O grave, where
is thy sting.”
