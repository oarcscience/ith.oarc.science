<span id="xvi.ii.ix-p1"></span> 12. Then again as he went on he saw what
was this time not visionary, but real gold scattered in the way. But
whether the devil showed it, or some better power to try the athlete and
show the Evil One that Antony truly cared nought for money, neither he
told nor do we know. But it is certain that that which appeared was
gold. And Antony marvelled at the quantity, but passed it by as though
he were going over fire; so he did not even turn, but hurried on at a
run to lose sight of the place. More and more confirmed in his purpose,
he hurried to the mountain, and having found a fort, so long deserted
that it was full of creeping things, on the other side of the river; he
crossed over to it and dwelt there. The reptiles, as though some one
were chasing them, immediately left the place. But he built up the
entrance completely, having stored up loaves for six months—this is a
custom of the Thebans, and the loaves often remain fresh a whole
year—and as he found water within, he descended as into a shrine, and
abode within by himself, never going forth nor looking at any one who
came. Thus he employed a long time training himself, and received
loaves, let down from above, twice in the year.

<span id="xvi.ii.ix-p2"></span>13. But those of his acquaintances who
came, since he did not permit them to enter, often used to spend days
and nights outside, and heard as it were crowds within clamouring,
dinning, sending forth piteous voices and crying, ‘Go from what is ours.
What dost thou even in the desert? Thou canst not abide our attack.’ So
at first those outside thought there were some men fighting with him,
and that they had entered by ladders; but when stooping down they saw
through a hole there was nobody, they were afraid, accounting them to be
demons, and they called on Antony. Them he quickly heard, though he had
not given a thought to the demons, and coming to the door he besought
them to depart and not to be afraid, ‘for thus,’ said he, ‘the demons
make their seeming onslaughts against those who are cowardly. Sign
yourselves therefore with the cross <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[1014](#fn_1013) , and depart boldly, and let these
make sport for themselves.’ So they departed fortified with the sign of
the Cross. But he remained in no wise harmed by the evil spirits, nor
was he wearied with the contest, for there came to his aid visions from
above, and the weakness of the foe relieved him of much trouble and
armed him with greater zeal. For his acquaintances used often to come
expecting to find him dead, and would hear him singing <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[1015](#fn_1014) , ‘Let God arise and let His
enemies be scattered, let them also that hate Him flee before His face.
As smoke vanisheth, let them vanish; as wax melteth before the face of
fire, so let the sinners perish from the face of God;’ and again, ‘All
nations compassed me about, and in the name of the Lord I requited
them <span id="fr_1015"></span>[1016](#fn_1015) .’
