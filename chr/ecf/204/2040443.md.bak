<span id="xxv.iii.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.i-p2.1"></span>Letter XLVI</span>.—*Letter <span
id="fr_4562"></span>[4563](#fn_4562.md) to the Mareotis from Sardica,*
<span class="c10"><span id="xxv.iii.iv.i-p3.3"></span>a.d</span>. 343–4.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.i-p4"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.i-p4.1"></span>Athanasius</span> to the presbyters and
deacons and the people of the Catholic Church in the Mareotis, brethren
beloved and longed for, greeting in the Lord.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.i-p5"></span>The holy council has praised your
piety in Christ. They have all acknowledged your spirit and fortitude in
all things, in that ye did not fear threats, and though you had to bear
insults and persecutions against your piety you held out. Your letters
when read out to all produced tears and enlisted universal sympathy.
They loved you though absent, and reckoned your persecutions as their
own. Their letter to you is a proof of their affection: and although it
would suffice to include you along with the holy Church of
Alexandria <span id="fr_4563"></span>[4564](#fn_4563.md) , yet the holy
synod has written separately to you in order that ye may be encouraged
not to give way on account of your sufferings, but to give thanks to
God; because your patience shall have good fruit.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.i-p7"></span>Formerly the character of the heretics
was not evident. But now it is revealed and laid open to all. For the
holy synod has taken cognisance of the calumnies these men have
concocted against you, and has had them in abhorrence, and has deposed
Theodore, Valens, Ursacius, in Alexandria <span
id="fr_4564"></span>[4565](#fn_4564.md) and the Mareotis by consent of all.
The same notice has been given to other Churches also. And since the
cruelty and tyranny practised by them against the Churches can no longer
be borne, they have been cast out from the episcopate and expelled from
the communion of all. Moreover of Gregory they were unwilling even to
make mention, for since the man has lacked the very name of bishop, they
thought it superfluous to name him. But on account of those who are
deceived by him they have mentioned his name; not because he seemed
worthy of mention, but that those deceived by him might thereby
recognise his infamy and blush at the kind of man with whom they have
communicated. You will learn what has been written about them from the
previous document <span id="fr_4565"></span>[4566](#fn_4565.md) : and
though not all of the bishops came together to sign, yet it was drawn up
by all, and they signed for all. Salute one another with a holy kiss.
All the brethren salute you.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.i-p10"></span>I, Protogenes <span
id="fr_4566"></span>[4567](#fn_4566.md) , bishop, desire that you may be
preserved in the Lord, beloved and longed for.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.i-p12"></span>I, Athenodorus\*, bishop, desire that
ye may be preserved in the Lord, most beloved brethren. \[Other

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.i-p3"></span> This and the following letters were
first printed by Scipio Maffei from a Latin <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.i-p3.2"></span>ms.</span> in the Chapter Library of
Verona, along with the *Historia Acephala.* They were included in
Galland, *Bibl. Patr.* vol. 5, and in Justiniani’s Ed. of Athanasius
(Padua, 1777). The letters are printed in Migne, xxvi. 1333, *sqq.,*
along with one (from the same source) addressed by the Council to the
Mareotic Churches. Hefele doubts their genuineness, but without reason
(ii. 166, *E. Tra.*) The list of signatures (an independent source of
information, *supr.* p. 147) alone proves the contrary. The two letters
may be taken as a supplement to the documents given, *Apol. c. Ar.*
37–50 (see also p. 147), with which they have many points of
resemblance. The Latin is very bad and occasionally without sense; it
bears clear traces of being a rendering by an unskilful hand from Greek.
