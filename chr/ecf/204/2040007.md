<span id="v.i.ii-p1"></span> §2. <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.ii-p1.1"></span>Translations</span>. The principal Latin
versions have been referred to in §1. Of those in foreign languages it
is not easy to procure adequate information. Fialon, in the work
mentioned below, translates *Apol. Const*. and *Apol. Fug*.; in German
the ‘Bibliothek der Kirchenväter,’ vols. 13–18, *Ausgew. Schriften des
h. Ath*., contains translations of several works by <span
class="c10"><span id="v.i.ii-p1.2"></span>Fisch</span>, Kempten from
1872. The principal English Translations are those in the ‘Library of
the Fathers.’ Of these, those edited or translated by <span
class="c10"><span id="v.i.ii-p1.3"></span>Newman</span> are incorporated
in this volume. Some letters included in this volume, as well as the
work against Apollinarianism, are also comprised in the volume (*Lib.
Fath*. 46, 1881) by <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.ii-p1.4"></span>Bright</span>, with excellent notes, &c., and
with a preface by Dr. Pusey (see below, p. 482). Translations of single
books will be noticed in the respective Introductions.
