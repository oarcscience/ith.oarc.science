<span id="vi.ii.i.xii-p1"></span> §12. *Other shameful actions ascribed
to heathen deities. All prove that they are but men of former times, and
not even good men.*

<span id="vi.ii.i.xii-p2"></span>For, to mention a few instances out of
many to avoid prolixity, who that saw his lawless and corrupt conduct
toward Semele, Leda, Alcmene, Artemis, Leto, Maia, Europe, Danae, and
Antiope, or that saw what he ventured to take in hand with regard to his
own sister, in having the same woman as wife and sister, would not scorn
him and pronounce him worthy of death? For not only did he commit
adultery, but he deified and raised to heaven those born of his
adulteries, contriving the deification as a veil for his lawlessness:
such as Dionysus, Heracles, the Dioscuri, Hermes, Perseus, and Soteira.
2. Who, that sees the so-called gods at irreconcileable strife among
themselves at Troy on account of the Greeks and Trojans, will fail to
recognise their feebleness, in that because of their mutual jealousies
they egged on even mortals to strife? Who, that sees Ares and Aphrodite
wounded by Diomed, or Hera and Aïdoneus from below the earth, whom they
call a god, wounded by Heracles, Dionysus by Perseus, Athena by Arcas,
and Hephæstus hurled down and going lame, will not recognise their real
nature, and, while refusing to call them gods, be assured (when he hears
that they are corruptible and passible) that they are nothing but
men <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) , and feeble men too, and
admire those that inflicted the wounds rather than the wounded? 3. Or
who that sees the adultery of Ares with Aphrodite, and Hephæstus
contriving a snare for the two, and the other so-called gods called by
He<span id="page_11">p. 11</span> <span
id="vi.ii.i.xii-Page_11"></span>phæstus to view the adultery, and coming
and seeing their licentiousness, would not laugh and recognise their
worthless character? Or who would not laugh at beholding the drunken
folly and misconduct of Heracles toward Omphale? For their deeds of
pleasure, and their unconscionable loves, and their divine images in
gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, we need not seriously
expose by argument, since the facts are abominable in themselves, and
are enough taken alone to furnish proof of the deception; so that one’s
principal feeling is pity for those deceived about them. 4. For, hating
the adulterer who tampers with a wife of their own, they are not ashamed
to deify the teachers of adultery; and refraining from incest themselves
they worship those who practise it; and admitting that the corrupting of
children is an evil, they serve those who stand accused of it and do not
blush to ascribe to those they call gods things which the laws forbid to
exist even among men.

<span id="vi.ii.i.xii-p3"></span> This explanation of gods as deified
men is known as Euhemerism, from Euhemerus, who broached the theory in
the third century, <span class="c10"><span
id="vi.ii.i.xii-p3.2"></span>b.c.</span> (*supra,* 10, note 1); but
‘there were Euhemerists in Greece before Euhemerus’ (Jowett’s Plato, 2.
101). The Fathers very commonly adopt the theory, for which, however,
there are very slight grounds. Such cases as those of Antinous and the
Emperors, as well as the legends of heroes and demigods, gave it some
plausibility (see Döllinger; *Gentile and Jew,* vol. i. p. 344, Eng.
Tr.).
