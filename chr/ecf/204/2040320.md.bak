<span id="xix.ii.xvii-p1"></span> 17. *A time to flee and a time to
stay.*

<span id="xix.ii.xvii-p2"></span>And if ever in their flight they came
unto those that sought after them, they did not do so without reason:
but when the Spirit spoke unto them, then as righteous men they went and
met their enemies; by which they also shewed their obedience and zeal
towards God. Such was the conduct of Elijah, when, being commanded by
the Spirit, he shewed himself unto Ahab <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466.md) ; and of Micaiah the prophet when
he came to the same Ahab; and of the prophet who cried against the altar
in Samaria, and rebuked Rehoboam <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467.md) ; and of Paul when he appealed unto
Cæsar. It was not certainly through cowardice that they fled: God
forbid. The flight to which they submitted was rather a conflict and war
against death. For with wise caution they guarded against these two
things; either that they should offer themselves up without reason (for
this would have been to kill themselves, and to become guilty of death,
and to transgress the saying of the Lord, ‘What God hath joined let not
man put asunder <span id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468) ’.md), or that
they should willingly subject themselves to the reproach of negligence,
as if they were unmoved by the tribulations which they met with in their
flight, and which brought with them sufferings greater and more terrible
than death. For he that dies, ceases to suffer; but he that flies, while
he expects daily the assaults of his enemies, esteems death lighter.
They therefore whose course was consummated in their flight did not
perish dishonourably, but attained as well as others the glory of
martyrdom. Therefore it is that Job was accounted a man of mighty
fortitude, because he endured to live under so many and such severe
sufferings, of which he would have had no sense, had he come to his end.
Wherefore the blessed Fathers thus regulated their conduct also; they
shewed no cowardice in fleeing from the persecutor, but rather
manifested their fortitude of soul in shutting themselves up in close
and dark places, and living a hard life. Yet did they not desire to
avoid the time of death when it arrived; for their concern was neither
to shrink from it when it came, nor to forestall the sentence determined
by Providence, nor to resist His dispensation, for which they knew
themselves to be preserved; lest by acting hastily, they should become
to themselves the cause of terror: for thus it is written, ‘He that is
hasty, with his lips, shall bring terror upon himself <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md) .’
