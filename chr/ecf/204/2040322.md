<span id="xix.ii.xix-p1"></span> 19. *The Saints courageous in their
flight, and divinely favoured.*

<span id="xix.ii.xix-p2"></span>These things both prove that their
previous flight was not the effect of cowardice; and testify that their
after conduct also was of no ordinary character: and they loudly
proclaim that they possessed in a high degree the virtue of fortitude.
For neither did they withdraw themselves on account of a slothful
timidity, on the contrary, they were at such times under the practice of
a severer discipline than at others; nor were they con<span

for their flight, or charged with cowardice, by such as are now so fond
of criminating others. Nay they were blessed through that declaration of
our Lord, ‘Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness
sake. <span id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475.md) ’ Nor yet were these
their sufferings without profit to themselves; for having tried them as
‘gold in the furnace,’ as Wisdom has said, God found them worthy of
Himself <span id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476.md) . And then they shone
the more ‘like sparks,’ being saved from them that persecuted them, and
delivered from the designs of their enemies, and preserved to the end
that they might teach the people; so that their flight and escape from
the rage of them that sought after them, was according to the
dispensation of the Lord. And so they became dear in the sight of God,
and had the most glorious testimony to their fortitude.
