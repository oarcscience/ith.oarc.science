<span id="xvi.ii.xxviii-p1"></span> 66. And he had also this favour
granted him. For as he was sitting alone on the mountain, if ever he was
in perplexity in his meditations, this was revealed to him by Providence
in prayer. And the happy man, as it is written, was taught of God <span

discussion with certain men who had come to him concerning the state of
the soul and of what nature its place will be after this life, the
following night one from above called him, saying, ‘Antony, rise, go out
and look.’ Having gone out therefore (for he knew whom he ought to obey)
looking up, he beheld one standing and reaching to the clouds, tall,
hideous, and fearful, and others ascending as though they were winged.
And the figure stretched forth his hands, and some of those who were
ascending were stayed by him, while others flew above, and having
escaped heaven-ward, were borne aloft free from care. At such,
therefore, the giant gnashed his teeth, but rejoiced over those who fell
back. And forthwith a voice came to Antony, ‘Understandest thou what
thou seest?’ And his understanding was <span id="page_214">p. 214</span>
<span id="xvi.ii.xxviii-Page_214"></span>opened, and he understood that
it was the passing of souls, and that the tall being who stood was the
enemy who envies the faithful. And those whom he caught and stopped from
passing through are accountable to him, while those whom he was unable
to hold as they passed upwards had not been subservient to him. So
having seen this, and as it were being reminded, he struggled the more
daily to advance towards those things which were before. And these
visions he was unwilling to tell, but as he spent much time in prayer,
and was amazed, when those who were with him pressed him with questions
and forced him, he was compelled to speak, as a father who cannot
withhold ought from his children. And he thought that as his conscience
was clear, the account would be beneficial for them, that they might
learn that discipline bore good fruit, and that visions were oftentimes
the solace of their labours.
