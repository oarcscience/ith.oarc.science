<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p2"></span>31. <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> the sentiment of Truth <span
id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395.md) in this matter must not be hidden,
but must have high utterance. For the Word of God was not made for us,
but rather we for Him, and ‘in Him all things were created <span
id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396.md) .’ Nor for that we were weak, was
He strong and made by the Father alone, that He might frame us by means
of Him as an instrument; perish the thought! it is not so. For though it
had seemed good to God not to make things originate, still had the Word
been no less with God, and the Father in Him. At the same time, things
originate could not without the Word be brought to be; hence they were
made through Him,—and reasonably. For since the Word is the Son of God
by nature proper to His essence, and is from Him, and in Him <span
id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397.md) , as He said Himself, the creatures
could not have come to be, except through Him. For as the light
enlightens all things by its radiance, and without its radiance nothing
would be illuminated, so also the Father, as by <span id="page_365">p.
365</span> <span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-Page_365"></span>a hand <span
id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398.md) , in the Word wrought all things,
and without Him makes nothing. For instance, God said, as Moses relates,
‘Let there be light,’ and ‘Let the waters be gathered together,’ and
‘let the dry land appear,’ and ‘Let Us make man <span
id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399.md) ;’ as also Holy David in the Psalm,
‘He spake and they were made; He commanded and they were created <span
id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400.md) .’ And He spoke <span
id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401.md) , not that, as in the case of men,
some under-worker might hear, and learning the will of Him who spoke
might go away and do it; for this is what is proper to creatures, but it
is unseemly so to think or speak of the Word. For the Word of God is
Framer and Maker, and He is the Father’s Will <span
id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402.md) . Hence it is that divine Scripture
says not that one heard and answered, as to the manner or nature of the
things which He wished made; but God only said, ‘Let it become,’ and he
adds, ‘And it became;’ for what He thought good and counselled, that
forthwith the Word began to do and to finish. For when God commands
others, whether the Angels, or converses with Moses, or commands
Abraham, then the hearer answers; and the one says, ‘Whereby shall I
know <span id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403.md) ?’ and the other, ‘Send
some one else <span id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404.md) ;’ and again,
‘If they ask me, what is His Name, what shall I say to them <span
id="fr_2405"></span>[2406](#fn_2405.md) ?’ and the Angel said to Zacharias,
‘Thus saith the Lord <span id="fr_2406"></span>[2407](#fn_2406.md) ;’ and
he asked the Lord, ‘O Lord of hosts, how long wilt Thou not have mercy
on Jerusalem?’ and waits to hear good words and comfortable. For each of
these has the Mediator <span id="fr_2407"></span>[2408](#fn_2407.md) Word,
and the Wisdom of God which makes known the will of the Father. But when
that Word Himself works and creates, then there is no questioning and
answer, for the Father is in Him and the Word in the Father; but it
suffices to will, and the work is done; so that the word ‘He said’ is a
token of the will for our sake, and ‘It was so,’ denotes the work which
is done through the Word and the Wisdom, in which Wisdom also is the
Will of the Father. And ‘God said’ is explained in ‘the Word,’ for, he
says, ‘Thou hast made all things in Wisdom;’ and ‘By the Word of the
Lord were the heavens made fast;’ and ‘There is one Lord Jesus Christ,
by whom are all things, and we by Him <span
id="fr_2408"></span>[2409](#fn_2408.md) .’

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p17"></span>32. It is plain from this that the
Arians are not fighting with us about their heresy; but while they
pretend us, their real fight is against the Godhead Itself. For if the
voice were ours which says, ‘This it My Son <span
id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409.md) ,’ small were our complaint of
them; but if it is the Father’s voice, and the disciples heard it, and
the Son too says of Himself, ‘Before all the mountains He begat me <span
id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410.md) ,’ are they not fighting against
God, as the giants <span id="fr_2411"></span>[2412](#fn_2411.md) in story,
having their tongue, as the Psalmist says, a sharp sword <span
id="fr_2412"></span>[2413](#fn_2412.md) for irreligion? For they neither
feared the voice of the Father, nor reverenced the Saviour’s words, nor
trusted the Saints, one of whom writes, ‘Who being the Brightness of His
glory and the Expression of His subsistence,’ and ‘Christ the power of
God and the Wisdom of God <span id="fr_2413"></span>[2414](#fn_2413.md) ;’
and another says in the Psalm, ‘With Thee is the well of life, and in
Thy Light shall we see light,’ and ‘Thou madest all things in
Wisdom <span id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414.md) ;’ and the Prophets
say, ‘And the Word of the Lord came to me <span
id="fr_2415"></span>[2416](#fn_2415.md) ;’ and John, ‘In the beginning was
the Word;’ and Luke, ‘As they delivered them unto us which from the
beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the Word <span
id="fr_2416"></span>[2417](#fn_2416.md) ;’ and as David again says, ‘He
sent His Word and healed them <span id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417.md)
.’ All these passages proscribe in every light the Arian heresy, and
signify the eternity of the Word, and that He is not foreign but proper
to the Father’s Essence. For when saw any one light without radiance? or
who dares to say that the expression can be different from the
subsistence? or has not a man himself lost his mind <span
id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418.md) who even entertains the thought
that God was ever without Reason and without Wisdom? For such
illustrations and such images has Scripture proposed, that, considering
the inability of human nature to comprehend God, we might be able to
form ideas even from these however poorly and dimly, and as far as is
attainable <span id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419.md) . And as the
creation contains <span id="page_366">p. 366</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.v-Page_366"></span>abundant matter for the knowledge of
the being of a God and a Providence (‘for by the greatness and beauty of
the creatures proportionably the Maker of them is seen <span
id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420) ’.md), and we learn from them without
asking for voices, but hearing the Scriptures we believe, and surveying
the very order and the harmony of all things, we acknowledge that He is
Maker and Lord and God of all, and apprehend His marvellous Providence
and governance over all things; so in like manner about the Son’s
Godhead, what has been above said is sufficient, and it becomes
superfluous, or rather it is very mad to dispute about it, or to ask in
an heretical way, How can the Son be from eternity? or how can He be
from the Father’s Essence, yet not a part? since what is said to be of
another, is a part of him; and what is divided, is not whole.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p30"></span>33. These are the evil sophistries of
the heterodox; yet, though we have already shewn their shallowness, the
exact sense of these passages themselves and the force of these
illustrations will serve to shew the baseless nature of their loathsome
tenet. For we see that reason is ever, and is from him and proper to his
essence, whose reason it is, and does not admit a before and an after.
So again we see that the radiance from the sun is proper to it, and the
sun’s essence is not divided or impaired; but its essence is whole and
its radiance perfect and whole <span
id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421.md) , yet without impairing the essence
of light, but as a true offspring from it. We understand in like manner
that the Son is begotten not from without but from the Father, and while
the Father remains whole, the Expression of His Subsistence is ever, and
preserves the Father’s likeness and unvarying Image, so that he who sees
Him, sees in Him the Subsistence too, of which He is the Expression. And
from the operation of the Expression we understand the true Godhead of
the Subsistence, as the Saviour Himself teaches when He says, ‘The
Father who dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works <span
id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422.md) ’ which I do; and ‘I and the Father
are one,’ and ‘I in the Father and the Father in Me <span
id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423.md) .’ Therefore let this
Christ—opposing heresy attempt first to divide <span
id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424.md) the examples found in things
originate, and say, ‘Once the sun was without his radiance,’ or,
‘Radiance is not proper to the essence of light,’ or ‘It is indeed
proper, but it is a part of light by division; and then let it divide
Reason, and pronounce that it is foreign to mind, or that once it was
not, or that it was not proper to its essence, or that it is by division
a part of mind.’ And so of His Expression and the Light and the Power,
let it do violence to these as in the case of Reason and Radiance; and
instead let it imagine what it will <span
id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425.md) . But if such extravagance be
impossible for them, are they not greatly beside themselves,
presumptuously intruding into what is higher than things originate and
their own nature, and essaying impossibilities <span
id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426.md) ?

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p37"></span>34. For if in the case of these
originate and irrational things offsprings are found which are not parts
of the essences from which they are, nor subsist with passion, nor
impair the essences of their originals, are they not mad again in
seeking and conjecturing parts and passions in the instance of the
immaterial and true God, and ascribing divisions to Him who is beyond
passion and change, thereby to perplex the ears of the simple <span
id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427.md) and to pervert them from the Truth?
for who hears of a son but conceives of that which is proper to the
father’s essence? who heard, in his first catechising <span
id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428.md) , that God has a Son and has made
all things by His proper Word, but understood it in that sense in which
we now mean it? who on the rise of this odious heresy of the Arians, was
not at once startled at what he heard, as strange <span
id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429.md) , and a second sowing, besides that
Word which had been sown from the beginning? For what is sown in every
soul from the beginning is that God has a Son, the Word, the Wisdom, the
Power, that is, His Image and Radiance; from which it at once follows
that He is always; that He is from the Father; that He is like; that He
is the eternal offspring of His essence; and there is no idea involved
in these of creature or work. But when the man who is an enemy, while
men slept, made a second sowing <span
id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430.md) , of ‘He is a creature,’ and ‘There
was once when He was not,’ and ‘How can it be?’ thenceforth the wicked
heresy of Christ’s enemies rose as tares, and forthwith, as bereft of
every <span id="page_367">p. 367</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.v-Page_367"></span>right thought, they meddle <span
id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431.md) like robbers, and venture to say,
‘How can the Son always exist with the Father?’ for men come of men and
are sons, after a time; and the father is thirty years old, when the son
begins to be, being begotten; and in short of every son of man, it is
true that he was not before his generation. And again they whisper, ‘How
can the Son be Word, or the Word be God’s Image? for the word of men is
composed of syllables <span id="fr_2432"></span>[2433](#fn_2432.md) , and
only signifies the speaker’s will, and then is over <span
id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433.md) and is lost.’

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p45"></span>35. They then afresh, as if
forgetting the proofs which have been already urged against them,
‘pierce themselves through <span id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434.md) ’
with these bonds of irreligion, and thus argue. But the word of
truth <span id="fr_2435"></span>[2436](#fn_2435.md) confutes them as
follows:—if they were disputing concerning any man, then let them
exercise reason in this human way, both concerning His Word and His Son;
but if of God who created man, no longer let them entertain human
thoughts, but others which are above human nature. For such as he that
begets, such of necessity is the offspring; and such as is the Word’s
Father, such must be also His Word. Now man, begotten in time, in
time <span id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436.md) also himself begets the
child; and whereas from nothing he came to be, therefore his word <span
id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437.md) also is over and continues not. But
God is not as man, as Scripture has said; but is existing and is ever;
therefore also His Word is existing <span
id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438.md) and is everlastingly with the
Father, as radiance of light. And man’s word is composed of syllables,
and neither lives nor operates anything, but is only significant of the
speaker’s intention, and does but go forth and go by, no more to appear,
since it was not at all before it was spoken; wherefore the word of man
neither lives nor operates anything, nor in short is man. And this
happens to it, as I said before, because man who begets it, has his
nature out of nothing. But God’s Word is not merely pronounced, as one
may say, nor a sound of accents, nor by His Son is meant His
command <span id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439.md) ; but as radiance of
light, so is He perfect offspring from perfect <span
id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440.md) . Hence He is God also, as being
God’s Image; for ‘the Word was God <span
id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441.md) ’ says Scripture. And man’s words
avail not for operation; hence man works not by means of words but of
hands, for they have being, and man’s word subsists not. But the ‘Word
of God,’ as the Apostle says, ‘is living and powerful and sharper than
any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts
and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not
manifest in His sight; but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes
of Him with whom we have to do. <span
id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md) ’ He is then Framer of all, ‘and
without Him was made not one thing <span
id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443.md) ,’ nor can anything be made without
Him.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p56"></span>36. Nor must we ask why the Word of
God is not such as our word, considering God is not such as we, as has
been before said; nor again is it right to seek how the word is from
God, or how He is God’s radiance, or how God begets, and what is the
manner of His begetting <span id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444.md) . For
a man must be beside himself to venture on such points; since a thing
ineffable and proper to God’s nature, and known to Him alone and to the
Son, this he demands to be explained in words. It is all one as if they
sought where God is, and how God is, and of what nature the Father is.
But as to ask such questions is irreligious, and argues an ignorance of
God, so it is not holy to venture such questions concerning the
generation of the Son of God, nor to measure God and His Wisdom by our
own nature and infirmity. Nor is a person at liberty on that account to
swerve in his thoughts from the truth, nor, if any one is perplexed in
such inquiries, ought he to disbelieve what is written. For it is better
in perplexity to be silent and believe, than to disbelieve on account of
the perplexity: for he who is perplexed may in some way obtain
mercy <span id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445.md) , because, though he
has questioned, he has yet kept quiet; but when a man is led by his
perplexity into forming for himself doctrines which beseem not, and
utters what is unworthy of God, such daring recurs a sentence without
mercy. For in such perplexities divine Scripture is able to afford him
some relief, so as to take rightly what is written, and to dwell upon
our word as an illustration; that as it is proper to us and is from us,
and not a work external to us, so also God’s Word is proper to Him and
from Him, and is not a work; and yet is not like the word <span
id="page_368">p. 368</span> <span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-Page_368"></span>of
man, or else we must suppose God to be man. For observe, many and
various are men’s words which pass away day by day; because those that
come before others continue not, but vanish. Now this happens because
their authors are men, and have seasons which pass away, and ideas which
are successive; and what strikes them first and second, that they utter;
so that they have many words, and yet after them all nothing at all
remaining; for the speaker ceases, and his word forthwith is spent. But
God’s Word is one and the same, and, as it is written, ‘The Word of God
endureth for ever <span id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446.md) ,’ not
changed, not before or after other, but existing the same always. For it
was fitting, whereas God is One, that His Image should be One also, and
His Word One and One His Wisdom <span
id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md) .

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p61"></span>37. Wherefore I am in wonder how,
whereas God is One, these men introduce, after their private notions,
many images and wisdoms and words <span
id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) , and say that the Father’s proper
and natural Word is other than the Son, by whom He even made the
Son <span id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md) and that He who is really
Son is but notionally <span id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) called
Word, as vine, and way, and door, and tree of life; and that He is
called Wisdom also in name, the proper and true Wisdom of the Father,
which coexist ingenerately <span id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451.md)
with Him, being other than the Son, by which He even made the Son, and
named Him Wisdom as partaking of it. This they have not confined to
words, but Arius composed in his Thalia, and the Sophist Asterius wrote,
what we have stated above, as follows: ‘Blessed Paul said not that he
preached Christ, the Power of God or the Wisdom of God,’ but without the
addition of the article, ‘God’s power’ and ‘God’s wisdom <span
id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452.md) ,’ thus preaching that the proper
Power of God Himself which is natural to Him, and co-existent in Him
ingenerately, is something besides, generative indeed of Christ, and
creative of the whole world, concerning which he teaches in his Epistle
to the Romans thus,—‘The invisible things of Him from the creation of
the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
made, even His eternal Power and Godhead <span
id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453.md) .’ For as no one would say that the
Godhead there mentioned was Christ, but the Father Himself, so, as I
think, ‘His eternal Power and Godhead also is not the Only Begotten Son,
but the Father who begat Him <span id="fr_2454"></span>[2455](#fn_2454.md)
.’ And he teaches that there is another power and wisdom of God,
manifested through Christ. And shortly after the same Asterius says,
‘However His eternal power and wisdom, which truth argues to be without
beginning and ingenerate, the same must surely be one. For there are
many wisdoms which are one by one created by Him, of whom Christ is the
first-born and only-begotten; all however equally depend on their
Possessor. And all the powers are rightly called His who created and
uses them:—as the Prophet says that the locust, which came to be a
divine punishment of human sins, was called by God Himself not only a
power, but a great power; and blessed David in most of the Psalms
invites, not the Angels alone, but the Powers to praise God.’

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p69"></span>38. Now are they not worthy of all
hatred for merely uttering this? for if, as they hold, He is Son, not
because He is begotten of the Father and proper to His Essence, but that
He is called Word only because of things rational <span
id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455.md) , and Wisdom because of things
gifted with wisdom, and Power because of things gifted with power,
surely He must be named a Son because of those who are made sons: and
perhaps because there are things existing, He has even His
existence <span id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456.md) , in our notions
only <span id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md) . And then after all
what is He? for He is none of these Himself, if they are but His
names <span id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) : and He has but a
semblance of being, and is decorated with these names <span
id="page_369">p. 369</span> <span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-Page_369"></span>from
us. Rather this is some recklessness of the devil, or worse, if they are
not unwilling that they should truly subsist themselves, but think that
God’s Word is but in name. Is not this portentous, to say that Wisdom
coexists with the Father, yet not to say that this is the Christ, but
that there are many created powers and wisdoms, of which one is the Lord
whom they go on to compare to the caterpillar and locust? and are they
not profligate, who, when they hear us say that the Word coexists with
the Father, forthwith murmur out, ‘Are you not speaking of two
Unoriginates?’ yet in speaking themselves of ‘His Unoriginate Wisdom,’
do not see that they have already incurred themselves the charge which
they so rashly urge against us <span
id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md) ? Moreover, what folly is there in
that thought of theirs, that the Unoriginate Wisdom coexisting with God
is God Himself! for what coexists does not coexist with itself, but with
some one else, as the Evangelists say of the Lord, that He was together
with His disciples; for He was not together with Himself, but with His
disciples;—unless indeed they would say that God is of a compound
nature, having wisdom a constituent or complement of His Essence,
unoriginate as well as Himself <span
id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460.md) , which moreover they pretend to be
the framer of the world, that so they may deprive the Son of the framing
of it. For there is nothing they would not maintain, sooner than hold
the truth concerning the Lord.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p76"></span>39. For where at all have they found
in divine Scripture, or from whom have they heard, that there is another
Word and another Wisdom besides this Son, that they should frame to
themselves such a doctrine? True, indeed, it is written, ‘Are not My
words like fire, and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in
pieces <span id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461.md) ?’ and in the
Proverbs, ‘I will make known My words unto you <span
id="fr_2462"></span>[2463](#fn_2462.md) ;’ but these are precepts and
commands, which God has spoken to the saints through His proper and only
true Word, concerning which the Psalmist said, ‘I have refrained my feet
from every evil way, that I may keep Thy words <span
id="fr_2463"></span>[2464](#fn_2463.md) .’ Such words accordingly the
Saviour signifies to be distinct from Himself, when He says in His own
person, ‘The words which I have spoken unto you <span
id="fr_2464"></span>[2465](#fn_2464.md) .’ For certainly such words are not
offsprings or sons, nor are there so many words that frame the world,
nor so many images of the One God, nor so many who have become men for
us, nor as if from many such there were one who has become flesh, as
John says; but as being the only Word of God was He preached by John,
‘The Word was made flesh,’ and ‘all things were made by Him <span
id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465.md) .’ Wherefore of Him alone, our Lord
Jesus Christ, and of His oneness with the Father, are written and set
forth the testimonies, both of the Father signifying that the Son is
One, and of the saints, aware of this and saying that the Word is One,
and that He is Only-Begotten. And His works also are set forth; for all
things, visible and invisible, have been brought to be through Him, and
‘without Him was made not one thing <span
id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466.md) .’ But concerning another or any
one else they have not a thought, nor frame to themselves words or
wisdoms, of which neither name nor deed are signified by Scripture, but
are named by these only. For it is their invention and Christ-opposing
surmise, and they make the most <span
id="fr_2467"></span>[2468](#fn_2467.md) of the name of the Word and the
Wisdom; and framing to themselves others, they deny the true Word of
God, and the real and only Wisdom of the Father, and thereby, miserable
men, rival the Manichees. For they too, when they behold the works of
God, deny Him the only and true God, and frame to themselves another,
whom they can shew neither by work, nor in any testimony drawn from the
divine oracles.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p84"></span>40. Therefore, if neither in the
divine oracles is found another wisdom besides this Son, nor from the
fathers <span id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468.md) have we heard of any
such, yet they have confessed and written of the Wisdom coexisting with
the Father unoriginately, proper to Him, and the Framer of the world,
this must be the Son who even according to them is eternally coexistent
with the Father. For He is Framer of all, as it is written, ‘In Wisdom
hast Thou made them all <span id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469.md) .’
Nay, Asterius himself, as if forgetting what he wrote before,
afterwards, in Caiaphas’s <span id="fr_2470"></span>[2471](#fn_2470.md)
fashion, involuntarily, when urging the Greeks, instead of naming many
wisdoms, or the caterpillar, confesses but one, in these words;—‘God the
Word is one, but many are the <span id="page_370">p. 370</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.v-Page_370"></span>things rational; and one is the
essence and nature of Wisdom, but many are the things wise and
beautiful.’ And soon afterwards he says again:—‘Who are they whom they
honour with the title of God’s children? for they will not say that they
too are words, nor maintain that there are many wisdoms. For it is not
possible, whereas the Word is one, and Wisdom has been set forth as one,
to dispense to the multitude of children the Essence of the Word, and to
bestow on them the appellation of Wisdom.’ It is not then at all
wonderful, that the Arians should battle with the truth, when they have
collisions with their own principles and conflict with each other, at
one time saying that there are many wisdoms, at another maintaining one;
at one time classing wisdom with the caterpillar, at another saying that
it coexists with the Father and is proper to Him; now that the Father
alone is unoriginate, and then again that His Wisdom and His Power are
unoriginate also. And they battle with us for saying that the Word of
God is ever, yet forget their own doctrines, and say themselves that
Wisdom coexists with God unoriginately <span
id="fr_2471"></span>[2472](#fn_2471.md) . So dizzied <span
id="fr_2472"></span>[2473](#fn_2472.md) are they in all these matters,
denying the true Wisdom, and inventing one which is not, as the
Manichees who make to themselves another God, after denying Him that is.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p90"></span>41. But let the other heresies and
the Manichees also know that the Father of the Christ is One, and is
Lord and Maker of the creation through His proper Word. And let the
Ario-maniacs know in particular, that the Word of God is One, being the
only Son proper and genuine from His Essence, and having with His Father
the oneness of Godhead indivisible, as we said many times, being taught
it by the Saviour Himself. Since, were it not so, wherefore through Him
does the Father create, and in Him reveal Himself to whom He will, and
illuminate them? or why too in the baptismal consecration is the Son
named together with the Father? For if they say that the Father is not
all-sufficient, then their answer is irreligious <span
id="fr_2473"></span>[2474](#fn_2473.md) , but if He be, for this it is
right to say, what is the need of the Son for framing the worlds, or for
the holy laver? For what fellowship is there between creature and
Creator? or why is a thing made classed with the Maker in the
consecration of all of us? or why, as you hold, is faith in one Creator
and in one creature delivered to us? for if it was that we might be
joined to the Godhead, what need of the creature? but if that we might
be united to the Son a creature, superfluous, according to you, is this
naming of the Son in Baptism, for God who made Him a Son is able to make
us sons also. Besides, if the Son be a creature, the nature of rational
creatures being one, no help will come to creatures from a
creature <span id="fr_2474"></span>[2475](#fn_2474.md) , since all <span
id="fr_2475"></span>[2476](#fn_2475.md) need grace from God. We said a few
words just now on the fitness that all things should be made by Him; but
since the course of the discussion has led us also to mention holy
Baptism, it is necessary to state, as I think and believe, that the Son
is named with the Father, not as if the Father were not all-sufficient,
not without meaning, and by accident; but, since He is God’s Word and
own Wisdom, and being His Radiance, is ever with the Father, therefore
it is impossible, if the Father bestows grace, that He should not give
it in the Son, for the Son is in the Father as the radiance in the
light. For, not as if in need, but as a Father in His own Wisdom hath
God founded the earth, and made all things in the Word which is from
Him, and in the Son confirms the Holy Laver. For where the Father is,
there is the Son, and where the light, there the radiance; and as what
the Father worketh, He worketh through the Son <span
id="fr_2476"></span>[2477](#fn_2476.md) , and the Lord Himself says, ‘What
I see the Father do, that do I also;’ so also when baptism is given,
whom the Father baptizes, him the Son baptizes; and whom the Son
baptizes, he is consecrated in the Holy Ghost <span
id="fr_2477"></span>[2478](#fn_2477.md) . And again as when the sun shines,
one might say that the radiance illuminates, for the light is one and
indivisible, nor can be detached, so where the Father is or is named,
there plainly is the Son also; and is the Father named in Baptism? then
must the Son be named with Him <span
id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478.md) .

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p97"></span><span id="page_371">p. 371</span>
<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-Page_371"></span>42. Therefore, when He made His
promise to the saints, He thus spoke; ‘I and the Father will come, and
make Our abode in him;’ and again, ‘that, as I and Thou are One, so they
may be one in Us.’ And the grace given is one, given from the Father in
the Son, as Paul writes in every Epistle, ‘Grace unto you, and peace
from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ <span
id="fr_2479"></span>[2480](#fn_2479.md) .’ For the light must be with the
ray, and the radiance must be contemplated together with its own light.
Whence the Jews, as denying the Son as well as they, have not the Father
either; for, as having left the ‘Fountain of Wisdom <span
id="fr_2480"></span>[2481](#fn_2480.md) ,’ as Baruch reproaches them, they
put from them the Wisdom springing from it, our Lord Jesus Christ (for
‘Christ,’ says the Apostle, is ‘God’s power and God’s wisdom <span
id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481) .md),’ when they said, ‘We have no
king but Cæsar <span id="fr_2482"></span>[2483](#fn_2482.md) .’ The Jews
then have the penal award of their denial; for their city as well as
their reasoning came to nought. And these too hazard the fulness of the
mystery, I mean Baptism; for if the consecration is given to us into the
Name of Father and Son, and they do not confess a true Father, because
they deny what is from Him and like His Essence, and deny also the true
Son, and name another of their own framing as created out of nothing, is
not the rite administered by them altogether empty and unprofitable,
making a show, but in reality being no help towards religion? For the
Arians do not baptize into Father and Son, but into Creator and
creature, and into Maker and work <span
id="fr_2483"></span>[2484](#fn_2483.md) . And as a creature is other than
the Son, so the Baptism, which is supposed to be given by them, is other
than the truth, though they pretend to name the Name of the Father and
the Son, because of the words of Scripture, For not he who simply says,
‘O Lord,’ gives Baptism; but he who with the Name has also the right
faith <span id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484.md) . On this account
therefore our Saviour also did not simply command to baptize, but first
says, ‘Teach;’ then thus: ‘Baptize into the Name of Father, and Son, and
Holy Ghost;’ that the right faith might follow upon learning, and
together with faith might come the consecration of Baptism.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p104"></span>43. There are many other heresies
too, which use the words only, but not in a right sense, as I have said,
nor with sound faith <span id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485.md) , and in
consequence the water which they administer is unprofitable, as
deficient in piety, so that he who is sprinkled <span
id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486.md) by them is rather polluted <span
id="fr_2487"></span>[2488](#fn_2487.md) by irreligion than redeemed. So
Gentiles also, though the name of God is on their lips, incur the charge
of Atheism <span id="fr_2488"></span>[2489](#fn_2488.md) , because they
know not the real and very God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. So
Manichees and Phrygians <span id="fr_2489"></span>[2490](#fn_2489.md) , and
the disciples of the Samosatene, though using the Names, nevertheless
are heretics, and the Arians follow in the same course, though they read
the words of Scripture, and use the Names, yet they too mock those who
receive the rite from them, being more irreligious than the other
heresies, and advancing beyond them, and making them seem innocent by
their own recklessness of speech. For these other heresies lie against
the truth in some certain respect, either erring concerning the Lord’s
Body, as if He did not take flesh of Mary, or as if He has not died at
all, nor become man, but only appeared, and was not truly, and seemed to
have a body when He had not, and seemed to have the shape of man, as
visions in a dream; but the Arians are without disguise irreligious
against the Father Himself. For hearing from the Scriptures that His
Godhead is represented in the Son as in an image, they blaspheme,
saying, that it is a creature, and everywhere concerning that Image,
they carry about <span id="fr_2490"></span>[2491](#fn_2490.md) with them
the phrase, ‘He was not,’ as mud in a wallet <span
id="fr_2491"></span>[2492](#fn_2491.md) , and spit it forth as
serpents <span id="fr_2492"></span>[2493](#fn_2492.md) their venom. Then,
whereas their doctrine is nauseous to all men, forthwith, as a support
against its fall, they prop up the heresy with human <span
id="fr_2493"></span>[2494](#fn_2493.md) patronage, that the simple, at the
sight or even by the fear may overlook the mischief of their perversity.
Right indeed is it to pity their dupes; well is it to weep over them,
for that they sacrifice their own interest for that immediate phantasy
which pleasures furnish, and forfeit their future hope. In thinking to
be baptized into the name of one who exists not, they will receive
nothing; and ranking themselves with a creature, from the creation they
will have no help, and believing in one unlike <span
id="fr_2494"></span>[2495](#fn_2494.md) and foreign to the Father in
essence, to the <span id="page_372">p. 372</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.v-Page_372"></span>Father they will not be joined, not
having His own Son by nature, who is from Him, who is in the Father, and
in whom the Father is, as He Himself has said; but being led astray by
them, the wretched men henceforth remain destitute and stripped of the
Godhead. For this phantasy of earthly goods will not follow them upon
their death; nor when they see the Lord whom they have denied, sitting
on His Father’s throne, and judging quick and dead, will they be able to
call to their help any one of those who have now deceived them; for they
shall see them also at the judgment-seat, repenting for their deeds of
sin and irreligion.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p31"></span> The Second Person in the Holy
Trinity is not a quality of attribute or relation, but the One Eternal
Substance; not a part of the First Person, but whole or entire God; nor
does the generation impair the Father’s Substance, which is,
antecedently to it, whole and entire God. Thus there are two Persons, in
Each Other ineffably, Each being wholly one and the same Divine
Substance, yet not being merely separate aspects of the Same, Each being
God as absolutely as if there were no other Divine Person but Himself.
Such a statement indeed is not only a contradiction in the terms used,
but in our ideas, yet not therefore a contradiction in fact; unless
indeed any one will say that human words can express in one formula, or
human thought embrace in one idea, the unknown and infinite God. Basil.

nothing, so we are utterly ignorant of the Divine Generation. It is
written, He who believes, not he who knows, has eternal life. The sun’s
radiance itself is but an earthly image, and gives us no true idea of
that which is above all images. *Eccl. Theol.* i. 12. So has S. Greg.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p71"></span> Of course this line of thought
consistently followed, leads to a kind of Pantheism; for what is the
Supreme Being, according to it, but an ideal standard of perfection, the
sum total of all that we see excellent in the world in the highest
degree, a creation of our minds, without real objective existence? The
true view of our Lord’s titles, on the other hand, is that He is That
properly and in perfection, of which in measure and degree the creatures
partake from and in Him. Vid. *supr. de Decr.* 17, n. 5.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p72"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p72.1"></span>κατ᾽ ἐπίνοιαν</span>, in idea or notion.
This is a phrase of very frequent occurrence, both in Athan. and other
writers. We have found it already just above, and *de Syn.* 15. *Or.* i.
9, also *Orat.* iv. 2, 3. *de Sent. D.* 2, *Ep. Æg* 12, 13, 14. It
denotes our idea or conception of a thing in contrast to the thing
itself. Thus, the sun is to a savage a bright circle in the sky; a man
is a ‘rational animal,’ according to a certain process of abstraction; a
herb may be medicine upon one division, food in another; virtue may be
called a mean; and faith is to one man an argumentative conclusion, to
another a moral peculiarity, good or bad. In like manner, the Almighty
is in reality most simple and uncompounded, without parts, passions,
attributes, or properties; yet we speak of Him as good or holy, or as
angry or pleased, denoting some particular aspect in which our infirmity
views, in which also it can view, what is infinite and incomprehensible.
That is, He is <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p72.3"></span>κατ᾽ ἐπίνοιαν</span> holy or merciful,
being in reality a Unity which is all mercifulness and also all
holiness, not in the way of qualities but as one indivisible perfection;
which is too great for us to conceive as It is.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p74"></span> The Anomœan in Max. *Dial.* i. a.
urges against the Catholic that, if the Son exists in the Father, God is
compound. Athan. here retorts that Asterius speaks of Wisdom as a really
existing thing in the Divine Mind. Vid. next note.

<span id="fn_2460"></span>[369:2461](2040365.htm#fr_2460.md) <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p74.2"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p75"></span> On this subject vid. *Orat.* iv. n.
2. Nothing is more remarkable than the confident tone in which Athan.
accuses Arians as here, and \[Marcellus\] in *Orat.* iv. 2. of
considering the Divine Nature as compound, as if the Catholics were in
no respect open to such a charge. Nor are they; though in avoiding it,
they are led to enunciate the most profound and ineffable mystery. Vid.
*supr.* §33, n. 1. The Father is the One Simple Entire Divine Being, and
so is the Son; They do in no sense share divinity between Them; Each is
<span class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p75.2"></span>ὅ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p75.3"></span>λος Θεός</span>. This
is not ditheism or tritheism, for they are the same God; nor is it
Sabellianism, for They are eternally distinct and substantive Persons;
but it is a depth and height beyond our intellect, how what is Two in so
full a sense can also in so full a sense be One, or how the Divine
Nature does not come under number. vid. notes on *Orat.* iii. 27 and 36.
Thus, ‘being uncompounded in nature,’ says Athan. ‘He is Father of One
Only Son.’ *de Decr.* 11. In truth the distinction into Persons, as
Petavius remarks, ‘avails especially towards the unity and simplicity of
God.’ vid. *de Deo,* ii. 4, 8.

Attribute called Wisdom; 2. that the Son was created by and called after
that Attribute; or 1. that Wisdom was ingenerate and eternal, 2. that
there were created wisdoms, words, powers many, of which the Son was
one.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.v-p91"></span> He says that it is contrary to all
our notions of religion that Almighty God cannot create, enlighten,
address, and unite Himself to His creatures immediately. This seems to
be implied in saying that the Son was created for creation,
illumination, &c.; whereas in the Catholic view the Son is but that
Divine Person who in the Economy of grace is creator, enlightener, &c.
God is represented all-perfect but acting according to a certain divine
order. This is explained just below. Here the remark is in point about
the right and wrong sense of the words ‘commanding,’ ‘obeying,’ &c.

such as the one quoted from Athan. *supr.* p. 76, note 3, where it is
said that in ‘Father’ is implied ‘Son,’ i.e. argumentatively as a
correlative. vid. *Sent. D.* 17. *de Decr.* 19, n. 6. The latter
accordingly Eusebius does not scruple to admit *in Sabell.* i. ap. Sirm.

the doctrine of the text, and is *not* the doctrine of an Arian who
considered the Son an instrument. Yet Petavius observes as to the very
*word* <span class="Greek"><span

senses in ecclesiastical writers was this which Arians would not
disclaim; its use to express the Catholic doctrine here spoken of was

[Next: Texts explained; Sixthly, Proverbs viii. 22. Proverbs are of a
figurative nature, and must be interpreted as such. We must interpret
them, and in particular this passage, by the Regula Fidei. 'He created
me' not equivalent to 'I am a creature.' Wisdom a creature so far forth
as Its human body. Again, if He is a creature, it is as 'a beginning of
ways,' an office which, though not an attribute, is a consequence, of a
higher and divine nature. And it is 'for the works,' which implied the
works existed, and therefore much more He, before He was created. Also
'the Lord' not the Father 'created' Him, which implies the creation was
that of a servant.](2040366.md)
