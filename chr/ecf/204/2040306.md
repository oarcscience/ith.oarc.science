id="xix.ii.iii-Page_256"></span>3. *Outrages of the Arians against the
Bishops.*

<span id="xix.ii.iii-p2"></span>For whom have they ever persecuted and
taken, that they have not insulted and injured as they pleased? Whom
have they ever sought after and found, that they have not handled in
such a manner, that either he has died a miserable death, or has been
ill-treated in every way? Whatever the magistrates appear to do, it is
their work; and the others are merely the tools of their will and
wickedness. In consequence, where is there a place that has not some
memorial of their malice? Who has ever opposed them, without their
conspiring against him, inventing pretexts for his ruin after the manner
of Jezebel? Where is there a Church that is not at this moment lamenting
the success of their plots against her Bishops? Antioch is mourning for
the orthodox Confessor Eustathius <span
id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396) ; Balaneæ for the most admirable
Euphration <span id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397) ; Paltus and
Antaradus for Kymatius <span id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398) and
Carterius; Adrianople for that lover of Christ, Eutropius, and his
successor Lucius, who was often loaded with chains by their means, and
so perished; Ancyra mourns for Marcellus, Berrhœa <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399) for Cyrus <span
id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400) , Gaza for Asclepas. Of all these,
after inflicting many outrages, they by their intrigues procured the
banishment; but for Theodulus and Olympius, Bishops of Thrace, and for
us and our Presbyters, they caused diligent search to be made, to the
intent that if we were discovered we should suffer capital punishment:
and probably we should have so perished, had we not fled at that very
time contrary to their intentions. For letters to that effect were
delivered to the Proconsul Donatus against Olympius and his fellows, and
to Philagrius against me. And having raised a persecution against Paul,
Bishop of Constantinople, as soon as they found him, they caused him to
be openly strangled <span id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401) at a
place called Cucusus in Cappadocia, employing as their executioner for
the purpose Philip, who was Prefect. He was a patron of their heresy,
and the tool of their wicked designs.
