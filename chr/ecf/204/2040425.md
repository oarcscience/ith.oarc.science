<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Letter XVIII</span>.—*(For 346.) Coss.
Augustus Constantius IV, Constans III; Præf. the same Nestorius; Indict.
iv; Easter-day iii Kal. Apr., iv Pharmuthi; Moon 21; Æra Dioclet. 62.*

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xiv-p2.1"></span>Athanasius</span>, to the Presbyters
and Deacons of Alexandria, brethren beloved in the Lord, greeting.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xiv-p3"></span>You have done well, dearly beloved
brethren, that you have given the customary notice of the holy Easter in
those districts; for I have seen and acknowledged your exactness. By
other letters I have also given you notice, that when this year is
finished, ye may know concerning the next. Yet now I have thought it
necessary to write the same things that, when you have it exactly, you
also may write with care. Therefore, after the conclusion of this feast,
which is now drawing to its close, on the twelfth of the month
Pharmuthi, which is on the vii Id. Apr. <span
id="fr_4435"></span>[4436](#fn_4435.md) , Easter-day will be on the iii
Kal, April; the fourth of Pharmuthi, according to the Alexandrians. When
therefore the feast is finished, give notice again in these districts,
according to early custom, thus: Easter Sunday is on the iii Kal. April,
which is the fourth of Pharmuthi, according to the Alexandrian
reckoning. And let no man hesitate concerning the day, neither let any
one contend, saying, It is requisite that Easter should be held on the
twenty-seventh of the month Phamenoth; for it was discussed in the holy
Synod <span id="fr_4436"></span>[4437](#fn_4436.md) , and all there settled
it to be on the iii Kal. April. I say then that it is on the fourth of
the month Pharmuthi; for the week before this is much too early <span
id="fr_4437"></span>[4438](#fn_4437.md) . Therefore let there be no
dispute, but let us act as becometh us. For I have thus written to the
Romans also. Give notice then as it has been notified to you, that it is
on the iii Kal. April; the fourth of Pharmuthi, according to the
Alexandrian reckoning.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xiv-p7"></span>That ye may have health in the
Lord, I pray, my dearly beloved brethren.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xiv-p6"></span> The 14th day of the Moon,
reckoning from the time of *mean* New Moon, took place on Sunday the
23rd. According to the rule which obtained in later times and continued
in use until the Gregorian reformation of the Calendar, the 14th day of
the *Ecclesiastical* Moon took place on Saturday the 22nd, which would
make Easter-day happen on the 23rd. It would seem, therefore, that the
decision of the Synod referred to, brought the Ecclesiastical Moon into
closer accordance with that of the heavens, than the later Calendar
would have done. In 357 Easter was apparently kept on Mar. 23<span
