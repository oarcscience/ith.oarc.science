<span id="xix.ii.viii-p1"></span> 8. *If it is wrong to flee, it is
worse to persecute.*

<span id="xix.ii.viii-p2"></span>But although <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423.md) they have done all this, yet they
are not ashamed of the evils they have already contrived against me, but
proceed now to accuse me, because I have been able to escape their
murderous hands. Nay, they bitterly bewail themselves, that they have
not effectually put me out of the way; and so they pretend to reproach
me with cowardice, not perceiving that by thus murmuring against me,
they rather turn the blame upon themselves. For if it be a bad thing to
flee, it is much worse to persecute; for the one party hides himself to
escape death, the other persecutes with a desire to kill; and it is
written in the Scriptures that we ought to flee; but he that seeks to
destroy transgresses the law, nay, and is himself the occasion of the
other’s flight. If then they reproach me with my flight, let them be
more ashamed of their own persecution <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424.md) . Let them cease to conspire, and
they who flee will forthwith cease to do so. But they, instead of giving
over their wickedness, are employing every means to obtain possession of
my person, not perceiving that the flight of those who are persecuted is
a strong argument against those who persecute. For no man flees from the
gentle and the humane, but from the cruel and the evil-<span
id="page_258">p. 258</span> <span
id="xix.ii.viii-Page_258"></span>minded. ‘Every one that was in
distress, and every one that was in debt <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425.md) ,’ fled from Saul, and took refuge
with David. But this is the reason why these men desire to cut off those
who are in concealment, that there may be no evidence forthcoming of
their wickedness. But herein their minds seem to be blinded with their
usual error. For the more the flight of their enemies becomes known, so
much the more notorious will be the destruction or the banishment which
their treachery has brought upon them <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426.md) ; so that whether they kill them
outright, their death will be the more loudly noised abroad against
them, or whether they drive them into banishment, they will but be
sending forth everywhere monuments of their own iniquity.
