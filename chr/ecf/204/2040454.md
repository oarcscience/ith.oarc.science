there, he saith to the Abbat Theodorus: Since the Passover is nigh,
visit the brethren after your manner; and as the Lord shall dispose me,
I will do. And he embraced him, and sent him away, having written a
letter by him to the Abbat Orsisius and the brethren, to the following
effect:’—

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xii-p4"></span>I have seen your fellow-worker and
father of the brethren, Theodorus, and in him the master of our father
Pachomius. And I rejoiced to see the sons of the Church, and they made
me glad by their presence. But the Lord is their recompenser. And as
Theodorus was about to leave me for you, he said to me: Remember me. And
I said to him: If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand be
forgotten, yea let my tongue cleave to my throat if I remember thee
not <span id="fr_4693"></span>[4694](#fn_4693) .

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xii-p2"></span> Orsisius was chosen abbat of
Tabenne in Upper Egypt, <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xii-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span> 347, in succession to
Petronius. Presently, however, he resigned in favour of Theodorus, the
favourite disciple of Pachomius. The two letters which follow are from
the life of Pachomius, §§92, 96, *Acta SS.* for May, vol. iii. (Also in
Migne xxvi. 977.) They belong, the first to the year 363 <span
class="c10"><span id="xxv.iii.iv.xii-p2.3"></span>a.d.</span>, not long
before the death of Julian (D.C.B. i. 199a), the second to the summer of
the following year, 364 (*infr.* note 3). Both letters are
characteristic; the second a moving and simple consolation to mourners.
