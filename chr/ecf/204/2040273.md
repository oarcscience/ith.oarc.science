<span id="xviii.ii.viii-p1"></span> 8. *Disproof of It.*

<span id="xviii.ii.viii-p2"></span>With such a man the slanderer thought
that I had been on terms of friendship, or rather he did not think so,
but like an enemy invented an incredible fiction: for he knows full well
that he has lied. I would that, whoever he is, he were present here,
that I might put the question to him on the word of Truth itself (for
whatever we speak as in the presence of God, we Christians consider as
an oath <span id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311) .md); I say, that I
might ask him this question, which of us rejoiced most in the well-being
of the departed Constans? who prayed for him most earnestly? The facts
of the foregoing charge prove this; indeed it is plain to every one how
the case stands. But although he himself knows full well, that no one
who was so disposed towards the departed Constans, and who truly loved
him, could be a friend to his enemy, I fear that being possessed with
other feelings towards him than I was, he has falsely attributed to me
those sentiments of hatred which were entertained by himself.
