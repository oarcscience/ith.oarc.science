<span id="vii.ii.xvi-p1"></span> §16. *He came then to attract man’s
sense-bound attention to Himself as man, and so to lead him on to know
Him as God.*

<span id="vii.ii.xvi-p2"></span>For men’s mind having finally fallen to
things of sense, the Word disguised Himself <span id="page_45">p.
45</span> <span id="vii.ii.xvi-Page_45"></span>by appearing in a body,
that He might, as Man, transfer men to Himself, and centre their senses
on Himself, and, men seeing Him thenceforth as Man, persuade them by the
works He did that He is not Man only, but also God, and the Word and
Wisdom of the true God. 2. This, too, is what Paul means to point out
when he says: “That ye <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244) being
rooted and grounded in love, may be strong to apprehend with all the
saints what is the breadth and length, and height and depth, and to know
the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto
all the fulness of God.” 3. For by the Word revealing Himself
everywhere, both above and beneath, and in the depth and in the
breadth—above, in the creation; beneath, in becoming man; in the depth,
in Hades; and in the breadth, in the world—all things have been filled
with the knowledge of God. 4. Now for this cause, also, He did not
immediately upon His coming accomplish His sacrifice on behalf of all,
by offering His body to death and raising it again, for by this <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245) means He would have made Himself
invisible. But He made Himself visible enough by what <span
id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246) He did, abiding in it, and doing such
works, and shewing such signs, as made Him known no longer as Man, but
as God the Word. 5. For by His becoming Man, the Saviour was to
accomplish both works of love; first, in putting away death from us and
renewing us again; secondly, being unseen and invisible, in manifesting
and making Himself known by His works to be the Word of the Father, and
the Ruler and King of the universe.
