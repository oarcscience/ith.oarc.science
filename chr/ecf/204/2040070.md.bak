<span id="vi.ii.i.xxv-p1"></span> §25. *Human sacrifice. Its absurdity.
Its prevalence. Its calamitous results.*

<span id="vi.ii.i.xxv-p2"></span>But some have been led by this time to
such a pitch of irreligion and folly as to slay and to offer in
sacrifice to their false gods even actual men, whose figures and forms
the gods are. Nor do they see, wretched men, that the victims they are
slaying are the patterns of the gods they make and worship, and to whom
they are offering the men. For they are offering, one may say, equals to
equals, or rather, the higher to the lower; for they are offering living
creatures to dead, and rational beings to things without motion. 2. For
the Scythians who are called Taurians offer in sacrifice to their
Virgin, as they call her, survivors from wrecks, and such Greeks as they
catch, going thus far in impiety against men of their own race, and thus
exposing the savagery of their gods, in that those whom Providence has
rescued from danger and from the sea, they slay, almost fighting against
Providence; because they frustrate the kindness of Providence by their
own brutal character. But others, when they are returned victorious from
war, thereupon dividing their prisoners into hundreds, and taking a man
from each, sacrifice to Ares the man they have picked out from each
hundred. 3. Nor is it only Scythians who commit these abominations on
account of the ferocity natural to them as barbarians: on the contrary,
this deed is a special result of the wickedness connected with idols and
false gods. For the Egyptians used formerly to offer victims of this
kind to Hera, and the Phœnicians and Cretans used to propitiate Cronos
in their sacrifices of children. And even the ancient Romans used to
worship Jupiter Latiarius, as he was called, with human sacrifices, and
some in one way, some in another, but all <span
id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) without exception committed and
incurred the pollution: they incurred it by the mere perpetration of the
murderous deeds, while they polluted their own temples by filling them
with the smoke of such sacrifices. 4. This then was the ready source of
numerous evils to mankind. For seeing that their false gods were pleased
with these things, they forthwith imitated their gods with like
misdoings, thinking that the imitation of superior beings, as they
considered them, was a credit to themselves. Hence mankind was thinned
by murders of grown men and children, and by licence of all kinds. For
nearly every city is full of licentiousness of all kinds, the result of
the savage character of its gods; nor is there one of sober life in the
idols’ temples <span id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) save only he
whose licentiousness is witnessed to by them all <span
id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) .

the lifeless image is the only one free from vice, although the
worshippers credit him with divine attributes, and therefore, according
to their superstition, with a licentious life.
