id="xxv.iii.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Letter LXIV</span>.—*To Diodorus
(fragment).*

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xix-p2"></span>To my lord, son, and most beloved
fellow-minister Diodorus \[bishop of *Tyre*\] <span
id="fr_4804"></span>[4805](#fn_4804.md) , Athanasius greeting in the Lord.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xix-p4"></span>I thank my Lord, Who is everywhere
establishing His doctrine, and chiefly so by means of His own sons, such
as actual fact shews you to be. For before your Reverence wrote, we knew
how great grace has been brought to pass in Tyre by means of your
perseverance. And we rejoice with you that by your means Tyre also has
learned the right word of piety. And I indeed took an opportunity of
writing to you, longed-for and beloved: but I marvel at your not having
replied to my letter. Be not then slow to write at once, knowing that
you give me refreshment, as a son to his father, and make me exceeding
glad, as a herald of truth. And enter upon no controversy with the
heretics, but overcome their argumentativeness with silence, their
ill-will with courtesy. For thus your speech shall be ‘with grace,
seasoned with salt <span id="fr_4805"></span>[4806](#fn_4805.md) ,’ while
they \[will be judged\] by the conscience of all.…

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xix-p3"></span> This fragment (Migne xxvi. 1261) is
given by Facundus, *Def. Tr. Cap.* iv. 2, who claims it as addressed to
Diodorus of Tarsus, the famous Antiochene confessor and master of
Chrysostom and Theodore. Unfortunately this is impossible, as Diodore
became bishop of Tarsus not before 378, i.e. after Athan. was dead. The
letter itself decides for Diodorus *of Tyre,* whom Paulinus of Antioch
had quite unwarrantably ordained to this see (cf. Rufin, *H. E.* ii.
21). Whether (as has been held on the authority of Rufinus) Diodorus, or
(as Le Quien, *Or. Chr.* ii. 865 *sq.* holds) Zeno, the nominee of
Meletius, was first in the field in the unseemly scramble, is doubtful.
Zeno is already bishop in 365 (Soz. vi. 12); the date of the appointment
of Diodorus, whose claim is at any rate no better than that of Paulinus
himself, is quite uncertain (see also Prolegg. ch. ii. §§9, 10).
Diodorus was the friend and correspondent of Epiphanius, and of Timothy,
bishop of Alexandria, second from Athanasius. Facundus confuses him in
these particulars also with his namesake of Tarsus, but the mistake is
thoroughly sifted by Tillemont, *Mem.* viii. pp. 238, 712. The letter is
important, along with *Letter* 56, and the correspondence of S. Basil,
as illustrating the attitude of Athanasius with regard to the unhappy
schism of Antioch.
