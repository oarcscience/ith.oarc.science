<span id="xix.ii.xiv-p1"></span> 14. *An hour and a time for all men.*

<span id="xix.ii.xiv-p2"></span>Now in so far as He was God and the Word
<span id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span
id="xix.ii.xiv-Page_260"></span>of the Father, He had no time; for He is
Himself the Creator of times <span id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md)
. But being made man, He shews by speaking in this manner that there is
a time allotted to every man; and that not by chance, as some of the
Gentiles imagine in their fables, but a time which He, the Creator, has
appointed to every one according to the will of the Father. This is
written in the Scriptures, and is manifest to all men. For although it
be hidden and unknown to all, what period of time is allotted to each,
and how it is allotted; yet every one knows this, that as there is a
time for spring and for summer, and for autumn and for winter, so, as it
is written <span id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) , there is a time
to die, and a time to live. And so the time of the generation which
lived in the days of Noah was cut short, and their years were
contracted, because the time of all things was at hand. But to Hezekiah
were added fifteen years. And as God promises to them that serve Him
truly, ‘I will fulfil the number of thy days <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) ,’ Abraham dies ‘full of days,’ and
David besought God, saying, ‘Take me not away in the midst of my
days <span id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) .’ And Eliphaz, one of
the friends of Job, being assured of this truth, said, ‘Thou shalt come
to thy grave like ripe corn, gathered in due time, and like as a shock
of corn cometh in in his season <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md) .’ And Solomon confirming his
words, says, ‘The souls of the unrighteous are taken away untimely <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md) .’ And therefore he exhorts in the
book of Ecclesiastes, saying, ‘Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou
hard: why shouldest thou die before thy time <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) ?’
