<span id="xix.ii.xv-p1"></span> 15. *The Lord’s hour and time.*

<span id="xix.ii.xv-p2"></span>Now as these things are written in the
Scriptures, the case is clear, that the saints know that a certain time
is measured to every man, but that no one knows the end of that time is
plainly intimated by the words of David, ‘Declare unto me the shortness
of my days <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454) .’ What he did not
know, that he desired to be informed of. Accordingly the rich man also,
while he thought that he had yet a long time to live, heard the words,
‘Thou fool, this night they are requiring thy soul: then whose shall
those things be which thou hast provided <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455) ?’ And the Preacher speaks
confidently in the Holy Spirit, and says, ‘Man also knoweth not his
time <span id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456) .’ Wherefore the
Patriarch Isaac said to his son Esau, ‘Behold, I am old, and I know not
the day of my death <span id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457) .’ Our
Lord therefore, although as God, and the Word of the Father, He both
knew the time measured out by Him to all, and was conscious of the time
for suffering, which He Himself had appointed also to His own body; yet
since He was made man for our sakes, He hid Himself when He was sought
after before that time came, as we do; when He was persecuted, He fled;
and avoiding the designs of His enemies He passed by, and ‘so went
through the midst of them <span id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458) .’
But when He had brought on that time which He Himself had appointed, at
which He desired to suffer in the body for all men, He announces it to
the Father, saying, ‘Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459) .’ And then He no longer hid
Himself from those who sought Him, but stood willing to be taken by
them; for the Scripture says, He said to them that came unto Him, ‘Whom
seek ye <span id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460) ?’ and when they
answered, ‘Jesus of Nazareth,’ He saith unto them, ‘I am He whom ye
seek.’ And this He did even more than once; and so they straightway led
Him away to Pilate. He neither suffered Himself to be taken before the
time came, nor did He hide Himself when it was come; but gave Himself up
to them that conspired against Him, that He might shew to all men that
the life and death of man depend upon the divine sentence; and that
without our Father which is in heaven, neither a hair of man’s head can
become white or black, nor a sparrow ever fall into the snare <span
id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461) .
