<span id="xvi.ii.vii-p1"></span> 8. Thus tightening his hold upon
himself, Antony departed to the tombs, which happened to be at a
distance from the village; and having bid one of his acquaintances to
bring him bread at intervals of many days, he entered one of the tombs,
and the other having shut the door on him, he remained within alone. And
when the enemy could not endure it, but was even fearful that in a short
time Antony would fill the desert with the discipline, coming one night
with a multitude of demons, he so cut him with stripes that he lay on
the ground speechless from the excessive pain. For he affirmed that the
torture had been so excessive that no blows inflicted by man could ever
have caused him such torment. But by the Providence of God—for the Lord
never overlooks them that hope in Him—the next day his acquaintance came
bringing him the loaves. And having opened the door and seeing him lying
on the ground as though dead, he lifted him up and carried him to the
church in the village, and laid him upon the ground. And many of his
kinsfolk and the villagers sat around Antony as round a corpse. But
about midnight he came to himself and arose, and when he saw them all
asleep and his comrade alone watching, he motioned with his head for him
to approach, and asked him to carry him again to the tombs without
waking anybody.

<span id="xvi.ii.vii-p2"></span>9. He was carried therefore by the man,
and as he was wont, when the door was shut he was within alone. And he
could not stand up on account of the blows, but he prayed as he lay. And
after he had prayed, he said with a shout, Here am I, Antony; I flee not
from your stripes, for even if you inflict more nothing shall separate
me <span id="fr_1010"></span>[1011](#fn_1010.md) from the love of Christ.
And then he sang, ‘though a camp be set against me, my heart shall not
be afraid <span id="fr_1011"></span>[1012](#fn_1011.md) .’ These were the
thoughts and words of this ascetic. But the enemy, who hates good,
marvelling that after the blows he dared to return, called together his
hounds and burst forth, ‘Ye see,’ said he, ‘that neither by the spirit
of lust nor by blows did we stay the man, but that he braves us, let us
attack him in another fashion.’ But changes of form for evil are easy
for the devil, so in the night they made such a din that the whole of
that place seemed to be shaken by an earthquake, and the demons as if
breaking the four walls of the dwelling seemed to enter through them,
coming in the likeness of beasts and creeping things. And the place was
on a sudden filled with the forms of lions, bears, leopards, bulls,
serpents, asps, scorpions, and wolves, and each of them was moving
according to his nature. The lion was roaring, wishing to attack, the
bull seeming to toss with its horns, the serpent writhing but unable to
approach, and the wolf as it rushed on was restrained; altogether the
noises of the apparitions, with their angry ragings, were dreadful. But
Antony, stricken and goaded by them, felt bodily pains severer still. He
lay watching, however, with unshaken soul, groaning from bodily anguish;
but his mind was clear, and as in mockery he said, ‘If there had been
any power in you, it would have sufficed had one of you come, but since
the Lord hath made you weak, you attempt to terrify me by numbers: and a
proof of your weakness is that you take the shapes of brute beasts.’ And
again with boldness he said, ‘If you are able, and have received power
<span id="page_199">p. 199</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vii-Page_199"></span>against me, delay not to attack; but if
you are unable, why trouble me in vain? For faith in our Lord is a seal
and a wall of safety to us.’ So after many attempts they gnashed their
teeth upon him, because they were mocking themselves rather than him.

<span id="xvi.ii.vii-p5"></span>10. Nor was the Lord then forgetful of
Antony’s wrestling, but was at hand to help him. So looking up he saw
the roof as it were opened, and a ray of light descending to him. The
demons suddenly vanished, the pain of his body straightway ceased, and
the building was again whole. But Antony feeling the help, and getting
his breath again, and being freed from pain, besought the vision which
had appeared to him, saying, ‘Where wert thou? Why didst thou not appear
at the beginning to make my pains to cease?’ And a voice came to him,
‘Antony, I was here, but I waited to see thy fight; wherefore since thou
hast endured, and hast not been worsted, I will ever be a succour to
thee, and will make thy name known everywhere.’ Having heard this,
Antony arose and prayed, and received such strength that he perceived
that he had more power in his body than formerly. And he was then about
thirty-five years old.
