<span id="vi.ii.i.xxviii-p1"></span> §28. *But neither can the cosmic
organism be God. For that would make God consist of dissimilar parts,
and subject Him to possible dissolution.*

<span id="vi.ii.i.xxviii-p2"></span>How then can these things be gods,
seeing that they need one another’s assistance? Or how is it proper to
ask anything of them when they too ask help for themselves one from
another? For if it is an admitted truth about God that He stands in need
of nothing, but is self-sufficient and self-contained, and that in Him
all things have their being, and that He ministers to all rather than
they to Him, how <span id="page_19">p. 19</span> <span
id="vi.ii.i.xxviii-Page_19"></span>is it right to proclaim as gods the
sun and moon and other parts of creation, which are of no such kind, but
which even stand in need of one another’s help? 2. But, perhaps, if
divided and taken by themselves, our opponents themselves will admit
that they are dependent, the demonstration being an ocular one. But they
will combine all together, as constituting a single body, and will say
that the whole is God. For the whole once put together, they will no
longer need external help, but the whole will be sufficient for itself
and independent in all respects; so at least the would-be philosophers
will tell us, only to be refuted here once more. 3. Now this argument,
not one whit less than those previously dealt with, will demonstrate
their impiety coupled with great ignorance. For if the combination of
the parts makes up the whole, and the whole is combined out of the
parts, then the whole consists of the parts, and each of them is a
portion of the whole. But this is very far removed from the conception
of God. For God is a whole and not a number of parts, and does not
consist of diverse elements, but is Himself the Maker of the system of
the universe. For see what impiety they utter against the Deity when
they say this. For if He consists of parts, certainly it will follow
that He is unlike Himself, and made up of unlike parts. For if He is
sun, He is not moon, and if He is moon, He is not earth, and if He is
earth, He cannot be sea: and so on, taking the parts one by one, one may
discover the absurdity of this theory of theirs. 4. But the following
point, drawn from the observation of our human body, is enough to refute
them. For just as the eye is not the sense of hearing, nor is the latter
a hand: nor is the belly the breast, nor again is the neck a foot, but
each of these has its own function, and a single body is composed of
these distinct parts,—having its parts combined for use, but destined to
be divided in course of time when nature, that brought them together,
shall divide them at the will of God, Who so ordered it;—thus (but may
He that is above pardon the argument <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143) .md), if they combine the parts of
creation into one body and proclaim it God, it follows, firstly, that He
is unlike Himself, as shewn above; secondly, that He is destined to be
divided again, in accordance with the natural tendency of the parts to
separation.
