unto kings. For Constantine Augustus, and his sons Constantius and
Constans the Augusti wrote letters to him, as to a father, and begged an
answer from him. But he made nothing very much of the letters, nor did
he rejoice at the messages, but was the same as he had been before the
Emperors wrote to him. But when they brought him the letters he called
the monks and said, ‘Do not be astonished if an emperor writes to us,
for he is a man; but rather wonder that God wrote the Law for men and
has spoken to us <span id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129.md) through His
own Son.’ And so he was unwilling to receive the letters, saying that he
did not know how to write an answer to such things. But being urged by
the monks because the emperors were Christians, and lest they should
take offence on the ground that they had been spurned, he consented that
they should be read, and wrote an answer approving them because they
worshipped Christ, and giving them counsel on things pertaining to
salvation: ‘not to think much of the present, but rather to remember the
judgment that is coming, and to know that Christ alone was the true and
Eternal King.’ He begged them to be merciful and to give heed to justice
and the poor. And they having received the answer rejoiced. Thus he was
dear to all, and all desired to consider him as a father.
