<span id="iv-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="iv-p3.1"></span>In</span> preparing the present volume the Editor
has aimed at providing the English reader with the most complete
apparatus for the study of Athanasius, his life, and his theological
influence, which could be brought within the compass of a single volume
of the ‘Nicene and Post-Nicene Library.’ The volume contains all the
most important treatises of Athanasius (in as nearly as possible their
exact chronological order), with the exception of the *ad Serapionem,*
the *contra Apollinarium,* the *ad Marcellinum,* and the exegetical
remains. On these and other treatises omitted from the present
collection the reader is referred to the Prolegomena, ch. iii.

<span id="iv-p4"></span>A great part of the volume, including the bulk
of the historical and anti-Arian works, and the Festal Letters, consists
of a revision of translations and notes comprised in the Oxford Library
of the Fathers. The notes to all, and the translation of most, of the
works in question, excepting the Festal Letters, were prepared for that
series by Mr. (since Cardinal) Newman. It was at first intended to
incorporate his work without any change; but as the volume began to take
shape this intention was inevitably to some extent modified; moreover,
the limits of space demanded the sacrifice of some of the less important
matter. The principles upon which the necessary changes have been made
will be found stated on pp. 304, 305, 450. What is there said applies
also to the *de Decretis* and *Letter of Eusebius,* as well as to the
notes to the historical pieces; it may be added that the translation of
the ‘Fourth Discourse’ has been very carefully revised, in order to
secure the utmost closeness to the somewhat difficult original. In all
the new translations, as well as in the revision of earlier work, the
aim has been to secure the strictest fidelity compatible with clearness.
The easy assumption that distinctions of tenses, constructions, &c.,
count for little or nothing in patristic Greek has been steadily
resisted. Doubtless there are passages where the distinction, for
example, of aorist and perfect, seems to fade away; but generally
speaking, Athanasius is fully sensitive to this and other points of
grammar.

<span id="iv-p5"></span>The incorporation in this volume of so much of
the ample patristic learning of Cardinal Newman has inevitably involved
some sacrifice of uniformity. To provide the new matter with
illustrative notes on anything like the same scale, even had it been
within the present editor’s power, would have involved the crowding out
of many works which the reader will certainly prefer to have before him.
Again, many opinions are expressed by Cardinal Newman which the present
editor is unable to accept. It may not be invidious to specify as an
example the many cases in which the notes enforce views of Church
authority, especially of papal authority, or again of the
justifiableness of religious persecution, which appear to be at any rate
foreign to the mind of Athanasius; or the tacit assumption that the men
of the fourth century can be divided by a broad and fast line into
orthodox and heretical, and that while everything may be believed to the
discredit of the latter, the former were at once uniform in their
convictions and consistently right in practice. Such an assumption
operates with special injustice against men like Eusebius, whose
position does not fall in with so summary a classification. But it has
been thought better to leave the notes in nearly all such cases as they
stand, only very rarely inserting a reference or observation to call
attention to another aspect of the case. And in no instance has the
editor forgotten the respect due to the theological learning and
personal greatness of Cardinal Newman, or to his peculiar eminence as a
religious thinker.

<span id="iv-p6"></span>But this has made it inevitable that many
matters are regarded in one way in the notes of Newman, and in quite
another where the present editor speaks for himself. What the great
Cardinal says of his ‘Historical Sketches’ (Preface to vol. ii.) holds
good to a large extent of his expositions of Athanasius. ‘Though mainly
historical, they are in their form and character polemical, as being
directed against certain Protestant ideas and opinions.’ The aim of the
<span id="page_vii">p. vii</span> <span id="iv-Page_vii"></span>present
editor has been throughout exclusively historical. He has regarded any
polemical purpose as foreign to the spirit in which this series was
undertaken, and moreover as fated in the long run to defeat its own aim.
Whatever results may ultimately be reaped from the field of patristic
studies, whether practical, dogmatic, or controversial, they must be
resolutely postponed or rather ignored, pending the application of
strict method to the criticism and interpretation of the texts, and to
the reconstruction of the history whether of the life or of the doctrine
of the Church. For the latter purpose, ‘lucifera experimenta, non
fructifera quærenda.’ To follow this method, without concealing, but
without obtruding, his personal convictions, has been the endeavour of
the present editor. That he has succeeded, it is not for him to claim:
but his work has been in this respect disinterested, and he ventures to
hope that readers of all opinions will at least recognise in it ‘un
livre de bonne foy.’

<span id="iv-p7"></span>The Prolegomena are not intended to be anything
approaching to a complete treatise upon the history, writings, or
theology of S. Athanasius. They are simply what their title implies, an
attempt to furnish in a connected form a preliminary account of the
matters comprised in the text of the volume, such as on the one hand to
reduce the necessity for a running historical commentary, on the other
hand to prepare the reader for the study of the text itself.

<span id="iv-p8"></span>Full indices have been added for the same
purpose. The general index comprises the leading theological and
historical topics, and a complete register of all personal names. This
latter seemed requisite in order to escape the arbitrariness of any line
which might have been drawn between important and insignificant
characters. The nobodies of history may occasionally be important
witnesses. The index of Scripture texts has been made with painful
attention to detail, and contains no unverified reference. To draw the
line in each case between formal citation and mere reminiscence would
have involved too great an expenditure of time and space; moreover there
are many probable reminiscences of Scripture language which it would
have been endless to include. But on the whole the index in question
claims to be a complete synopsis of the use made of the Bible in the
text of this volume. As such it is hoped that, with whatever occasional
errors, it may be of use to the patristic and the biblical student
alike.

<span id="iv-p9"></span>For the original matter comprised in this volume
the editor disclaims any credit of his own. He has aimed simply at
consulting and comparing the best authorities, at sifting their
conclusions, and at following those which seem best founded. That in
doing so the original sources are ready to hand throughout is the
peculiar good fortune of those who work at Athanasius. It remains, then,
for the editor to express his principal obligations to modern writers.
To mention those of earlier date, such as Montfaucon and Tillemont, is
merely to say that he has not neglected the indispensable foundations of
his task. But Athanasius has also attracted to the study of his works
much of the best patristic scholarship of recent times. Among the names
mentioned in the first chapter of the Prolegomena, that of Cardinal
Newman speaks for itself. No English student will neglect his *Arians,*
however much some of its views may require modification. Pre-eminent for
accurate knowledge of the texts and for vivid presentment of the history
is Dr. Bright, whose works have been constantly open before the present
editor, and have secured him from many an oversight. His occasional
divergence from Dr. Bright’s views, especially on points of chronology,
has gone along with grateful appreciation of this scholar’s genuine
historical interest, large theological grasp, and perhaps unequalled
personal sympathy with Athanasius as a man and as a writer. (On the use
made in this volume of his *Later Treatises of S. Athanasius,* the
reader is referred to what is said, *infr*. p. 482.)

<span id="iv-p10"></span>Last, but not least, the editor must
acknowledge his obligations to Mr. Gwatkin. To say that that writer’s
*Studies of Arianism* have done more than any one work with which he is
acquainted to place the intricate story of the period on a secure
historical footing is saying a great deal, but by no means too much. To
say that whatever historical accuracy has been attained in this volume
has been rendered possible by Mr. Gwatkin’s previous labours is to the
present writer a matter of mere honest acknowledgment. Especially this
is the case in chronological questions. Here Mr. Gwatkin has in no
single instance been blindly followed, or without the attempt to
interrogate the sources independently. But in nearly all cases Mr.
Gwatkin’s results, which, it should be added, are those accepted by the
best continental students also, have held their own. It has been the
editor’s misfortune to differ from Mr. Gwatkin now and then, for example
with regard to the Life of Antony: but even where he has differed as to
conclusions, he has received help and instruction from Mr. Gwatkin’s
ample command of material, and genuinely scientific method.

<span id="iv-p11"></span><span id="page_viii">p. viii</span> <span
id="iv-Page_viii"></span>In addition to the above writers, the manifold
obligations of the editor are recorded in the introductions and notes:
if any have been passed over, it has been due to inadvertence or to the
necessity of condensation. For the suggestions and help of personal
friends the editor’s gratitude may be here expressed without the mention
of names. But he may specially mention the Rev. H. Ellershaw and Miss
Payne Smith, to the former of whom he owes the translation of the Life
of Antony, while the latter has kindly revised the Oxford translation of
the bulk of the Festal Letters. Lastly, the many kindnesses, and uniform
consideration, shewn to him by the English editor of this series call
for his warmest recognition: that they may prove not wholly thrown away
is the utmost that their recipient can venture to hope.
