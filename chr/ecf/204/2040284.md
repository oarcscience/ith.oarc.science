<span id="xviii.ii.xix-p1"></span> 19. *Fourth charge, of having
disobeyed an Imperial order.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xix-p2"></span>And now, if it please you, let us
consider the remaining accusation, and permit me to answer it likewise.
They have dared to charge me with resisting your commands, and refusing
to leave my Church. Truly I wonder they are not weary of uttering their
calumnies; I however am not yet weary of answering them, I rather
rejoice to do so; for the more abundant my defence is, the more entirely
must they be condemned. I did not resist the commands of your Piety, God
forbid; I am not a man that would resist even the Quæstor <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md) of the city, much less so great a
Prince. On this matter I need not many words, for the whole city will
bear witness for me. Nevertheless, permit me again to relate the
circumstances from the beginning; for when you hear them, I am sure you
will be astonished at the presumption of my enemies. Montanus, the
officer of the Palace <span id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340.md) , came
and brought me a letter, which purported to be an answer to one from me,
requesting that I might go into Italy, for the purpose of obtaining a
supply of the deficiencies which I thought existed in the condition of
our Churches. Now I desire to thank your Piety, which condescended to
assent to my request, on the supposition that I had written to you, and
has made provision <span id="fr_1341"></span>[1342](#fn_1341.md) for me to
undertake the journey, and to accomplish it without trouble. But here
again I am astonished at those who have spoken falsehood in your ears,
that they were not afraid, seeing that lying belongs to the Devil, and
that liars are alien from Him who says, ‘I am the Truth <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342.md) .’ For I never wrote to you, nor
will my accuser be able to find any such letter; and though I ought to
have written every day, if I might thereby <span id="page_246">p.
246</span> <span id="xviii.ii.xix-Page_246"></span>behold your gracious
countenance, yet it would neither have been pious to desert the
Churches, nor right to be troublesome to your Piety, especially since
you are willing to grant our requests in behalf of the Church, although
we are not present to make them. Now may it please you to order me to
read what Montanus commanded me to do. This is as follows <span
id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343.md) .\*\*\*
