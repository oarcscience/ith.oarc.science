rejoiced when they heard the anti-Christian heresy anathematised by such
a man. And all the people in the city ran together to see Antony; and
the Greeks and those who are called their Priests, <span

into the church, saying, ‘We ask to see the man of God,’ for so they all
called him. For in that place also the Lord cleansed many of demons, and
healed those who were mad. And many Greeks asked that they might even

as many became Christians in those few days as one would have seen made
in a year. Then when some thought that he was troubled by the crowds,
and on this account turned them all away from him, he said,

were setting him forth on his way, as we <span

Christ, the child was raised whole, for the unclean spirit was gone
forth. And the mother blessed God, and all gave thanks. And Antony
himself also rejoiced, departing to the mountain as though it were to
his own home.
