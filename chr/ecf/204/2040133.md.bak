<span id="vii.ii.xxxvi-p1"></span> §36. *Prophecies of Christ’s
sovereignty, flight into Egypt, &c.*

<span id="vii.ii.xxxvi-p2"></span>But what king that ever was, before he
had strength to call father or mother, reigned and gained triumphs over
his enemies <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) ? Did not David come
to the throne at thirty years of age, and Solomon, when he had grown to
be a young man? Did not Joas enter on the kingdom when seven years old,
and Josias, a still later king, receive the government about the seventh
year of his age? And yet they at that age had strength to call father or
mother. 2. Who, then, is there that was reigning and spoiling his
enemies almost before his birth? Or what king of this sort has ever been
in Israel and in Juda—let the Jews, who have searched out the matter,
tell us—in whom all the nations have placed their hopes and had peace,
instead of being at enmity with them on every side? 3. For as long as
Jerusalem stood there was war without respite betwixt them, and they all
fought with Israel; the Assyrians oppressed them, the Egyptians
persecuted them, the Babylonians fell upon them; and, strange to say,
they had even the Syrians their neighbours at war against them. Or did
not David war against them of Moab, and smite the Syrians, Josias guard
against his neighbours, and Ezechias quail at the boasting of
Senacherim, and Amalek make war against Moses, and the Amorites oppose
him, and the inhabitants of Jericho array themselves against Jesus son
of Naue? And, in a word, treaties of friendship had no place between the
nations and Israel. Who, then, it is on whom the nations are to set
their hope, it is worth while to see. For there must be such an one, as
it is impossible for the prophet to have spoken falsely. 4. But which of
the holy prophets or of the early patriarchs has died on the Cross for
the salvation of all? Or who was wounded and destroyed for the healing
of all? Or which of the righteous men, or kings, went down to Egypt, so
that at his coming the idols of Egypt fell <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) ? For Abraham went thither, but
idolatry prevailed universally all the same. Moses was born there, and
the deluded worship of the people was there none the less.
