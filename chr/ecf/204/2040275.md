<span id="xviii.ii.x-p1"></span> 10. *His loyalty towards Constantius
and his brother.*

<span id="xviii.ii.x-p2"></span>How with this apprehension of such a
design on their part, was there not an additional probability of my
praying for your Grace? Should I feel affection for his murderer, and
entertain dislike towards you his brother who avenged his death? Should
I remember his crime, and forget that kindness of yours which you
vouchsafed to assure me by letter <span
id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md) should remain the same towards me
after your brother’s death of happy memory, as it had been during his
lifetime? How could I have borne to look upon the murderer? Must I not
have thought that the blessed Prince beheld me, when I prayed for your
safety? For brothers are by nature mirrors of each other. Wherefore as
seeing you in him, I never should have slandered you before him; and as
seeing him in you, never should I have written to his enemy, instead of
praying for your safety. Of this my witnesses are, first of all, the
Lord who has heard and has given to you entire the kingdom of your
forefathers: and next those persons who were present at the time,
Felicissimus, who was Duke of <span id="page_242">p. 242</span> <span
id="xviii.ii.x-Page_242"></span>Egypt, Rufinus, and Stephanus, the
former of whom was Receiver-general, the latter, Master there; Count
Asterius, and Palladius Master of the palace, Antiochus and Evagrius
Official Agents <span id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md) . I had only
to say, ‘Let us pray for the safety of the most religious Emperor,
Constantius Augustus,’ and all the people immediately cried out with one
voice, ‘O Christ send help to Constantius;’ and they continued praying
thus for some time <span id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316.md) .

Greek writers Catholici (<span class="Greek"><span

*ad Euseb.* vii. 10.), were the same as the Procurators (Gibbon, *Hist.*
ch. xvii. note 148.), who succeeded the Provincial Quæstors in the early
times of the Empire. They were in the department of the Comes Sacrarum
Largitionum, or High Treasurer of the Revenue (Gothofr. *Cod. Theod.* t.
6. p. 327). Both Gothofr. however and Pancirolus, p. 134. Ed. 1623,
place Rationales also under the Comes Rerum Privatarum. Pancirolus, p.
120. mentions the Comes Rationalis Summarum Ægypti as distinct from
other functionaries. Gibbon, ch. xvii. seems to say that there were in
all 29, of whom 18 were counts. 2. Stephanus, <span class="Greek"><span

‘Master of the camp of Egypt,’ vol. viii. p. 137. 3. The Master of the
offices or of the palace has been noticed above, p. 239, note 4. 4.

agentes in rebus. These were functionaries under the Master of the
offices, whose business it was to announce the names of the consuls and
the edicts or victories of the Empire. They at length became spies of
the Court, vid. Gibbon, ch. xvii. Gothofr. *Cod. Th.* vi. 27.
