the rest of the brethren that they may learn what the life of monks
ought to be; and may believe that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
glorifies those who glorify Him: and leads those who serve Him unto the
end, not only to the kingdom of heaven, but here also—even though they
hide themselves and are desirous of withdrawing from the world—makes
them illustrious and well known everywhere on account of their virtue
and the help they render others. And if need be, read this among the
heathen, that even in this way they may learn that our Lord Jesus Christ
is not only God and the Son of God, but also that the Christians who
truly serve Him and religiously believe on Him, prove, not only that the
demons, whom the Greeks themselves think to be gods, are no gods, but
also tread them under foot and put them to flight, as deceivers and
corrupters of mankind, through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be glory
for ever and ever. Amen.
