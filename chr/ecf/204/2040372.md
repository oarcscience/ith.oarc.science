<span id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—<span
class="c10"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p1.2"></span>Texts Explained;
Eighthly,</span> <span id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p1.3"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p1.4"></span>[John xvii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p1.5"></span></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p1.6"></span>. and the Like.</span> *Our Lord’s
divinity cannot interfere with His Father’s prerogatives, as the One
God, which were so earnestly upheld by the Son. ‘One’ is used in
contrast to false gods and idols, not to the Son, through whom the
Father spoke. Our Lord adds His Name to the Father’s, as included in
Him. The Father the First, not as if the Son were not First too, but as
Origin.*

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p2"></span>7. Now that this is the sense of the
Prophet is clear and manifest to all; but since the irreligious men,
alleging such passages also, dishonour the Lord and reproach us, saying,
‘Behold God is said to be One and Only and First; how say ye that the
Son is God? for if He were God, He had not said, “I Alone,” nor “God is
One <span id="fr_2844"></span>[2845](#fn_2844.md) ;”’ it is necessary to
declare the sense of these phrases in addition, as far as we can, that
all may know from this also that the Arians are really contending with
God <span id="fr_2845"></span>[2846](#fn_2845.md) . If there then is
rivalry of the Son towards the Father, then be such words uttered
against Him; and if according to what is said to David concerning
Adonijah and Absalom <span id="fr_2846"></span>[2847](#fn_2846.md) , so
also the Father looks upon the Son, then let Him utter and urge such
words against Himself, lest He the Son, calling Himself God, make any to
revolt from the Father. But if he who knows the Son, on the contrary,
knows the Father, the Son Himself revealing Him to him, and in the Word
he shall rather see the Father, as has been said, and if the Son on
coming, glorified not Himself but the Father, saying to one who came to
Him, ‘Why callest thou Me good? none is good save One, that is,
God <span id="fr_2847"></span>[2848](#fn_2847.md) ;’ and to one who asked,
what was the great commandment in the Law, answering, ‘Hear, O Israel,
the Lord our God is One Lord <span id="fr_2848"></span>[2849](#fn_2848.md)
;’ and saying to the multitudes, ‘I came down from heaven, not to do My
own will, but the will of Him that sent Me <span
id="fr_2849"></span>[2850](#fn_2849.md) ;’ and teaching the disciples, ‘My
Father is greater than I,’ and ‘He that honoureth Me, honoureth Him that
sent Me <span id="fr_2850"></span>[2851](#fn_2850.md) ;’ if the Son is such
towards His own Father, what is the difficulty <span
id="fr_2851"></span>[2852](#fn_2851.md) , that one must need take such a
view of such passages? and on the other hand, if the Son is the Father’s
Word, who is so wild, besides these Christ-opposers, as to think that
God has thus spoken, as traducing and denying His own Word? This is not
the mind of Christians; perish the thought; for not with reference to
the Son is it thus written, but for the denial of those falsely called
gods, invented by men.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p11"></span>8. And this account of the meaning of
such passages is satisfactory; for since those who are devoted to gods
falsely so called, revolt from the True God, therefore God, being good
and careful for mankind, recalling the wanderers, says, ‘I am Only God,’
and ‘I Am,’ and ‘Besides Me there is no God,’ and the like; that He may
condemn things which are not, and may convert all men to Himself. And
as, supposing in the daytime when the sun was shining, a man were rudely
to paint a piece of wood, which had not even the appearance of light,
and call that image the cause of light, and if the sun with regard to it
were to say, ‘I alone am the light of the day, and there is no other
light of the day but I,’ he would say this, with regard, not to his own
radiance, but to the error arising from the wooden image and the
dissimilitude of that vain representation; so it is with ‘I am,’ and ‘I
am Only God,’ and ‘There is none other besides Me,’ viz. that He may
make men renounce falsely called gods, and that they may recognise Him
the true God <span id="page_398">p. 398</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-Page_398"></span>instead. Indeed when God said this, He
said it through His own Word, unless forsooth the modern <span
id="fr_2852"></span>[2853](#fn_2852.md) Jews add this too, that He has not
said this through His Word; but so hath He spoken, though they rave,
these followers of the devil <span id="fr_2853"></span>[2854](#fn_2853.md)
. For the Word of the Lord came to the Prophet, and this was what was
heard; nor is there a thing which God says or does, but He says and does
it in the Word. Not then with reference to Him is this said, O Christ’s
enemies, but to things foreign to Him and not from <span
id="fr_2854"></span>[2855](#fn_2854.md) Him. For according to the aforesaid
illustration, if the sun had spoken those words, he would have been
setting right the error and have so spoken, not as having his radiance
without him, but in the radiance shewing his own light. Therefore not
for the denial of the Son, nor with reference to Him, are such passages,
but to the overthrow of falsehood. Accordingly God spoke not such words
to Adam at the beginning, though His Word was with Him, by whom all
things came to be; for there was no need, before idols came in; but when
men made insurrection against the truth and named for themselves gods
such as they would <span id="fr_2855"></span>[2856](#fn_2855.md) , then it
was that need arose of such words, for the denial of gods that were not.
Nay I would add, that they were said even in anticipation of the folly
of these Christ-opposers <span id="fr_2856"></span>[2857](#fn_2856.md) ,
that they might know, that whatsoever god they devise external to the
Father’s Essence, he is not True God, nor Image and Son of the Only and
First.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p17"></span>9. If then the Father be called the
only true God, this is said not to the denial of Him who said, ‘I am the
Truth <span id="fr_2857"></span>[2858](#fn_2857.md) ,’ but of those on the
other hand who by nature are not true, as the Father and His Word are.
And hence the Lord Himself added at once, ‘And Jesus Christ whom Thou
didst send <span id="fr_2858"></span>[2859](#fn_2858.md) .’ Now had He been
a creature, He would not have added this, and ranked Himself with His
Creator (for what fellowship is there between the True and the not
true?); but as it is, by adding Himself to the Father, He has shewn that
He is of the Father’s nature; and He has given us to know that of the
True Father He is True Offspring. And John too, as he had learned <span
id="fr_2859"></span>[2860](#fn_2859.md) , so he teaches this, writing in
his Epistle, ‘And we are in the True, even in His Son Jesus Christ; This
is the True God and eternal life <span
id="fr_2860"></span>[2861](#fn_2860.md) .’ And when the Prophet says
concerning the creation, ‘That stretcheth forth the heavens alone <span
id="fr_2861"></span>[2862](#fn_2861.md) ,’ and when God says, ‘I only
stretch out the heavens,’ it is made plain to every one, that in the
Only is signified also the Word of the Only, in whom ‘all things were
made,’ and without whom ‘was made not one thing.’ Therefore, if they
were made through the Word, and yet He says, ‘I Only,’ and together with
that Only is understood the Son, through whom the heavens were made, so
also then, if it be said, ‘One God,’ and ‘I Only,’ and ‘I the First,’ in
that One and Only and First is understood the Word coexisting, as in the
Light the Radiance. And this can be understood of no other than the Word
alone. For all other things subsisted out of nothing through the Son,
and are greatly different in nature; but the Son Himself is natural and
true Offspring from the Father; and thus the very passage which these
insensates have thought fit to adduce, ‘I the First,’ in defence of
their heresy, doth rather expose their perverse spirit. For God says, ‘I
the First and I the Last;’ if then, as though ranked with the things
after Him, He is said to be first of them, so that they come next to
Him, then certainly you will have shewn that He Himself precedes the
works in time only <span id="fr_2862"></span>[2863](#fn_2862.md) ; which,
to go no further, is extreme irreligion; but if it is in order to prove
that He is not from any, nor any before Him, but that He is Origin and
Cause of all things, and to destroy the Gentile fables, that He has said
‘I the First,’ it is plain also, that when the Son is called First-born,
this is done not for the sake of ranking Him with the creation, but to
prove the framing and adoption of all things <span
id="fr_2863"></span>[2864](#fn_2863.md) through the Son. For as the Father
is First, so also is He both First <span
id="fr_2864"></span>[2865](#fn_2864.md) , as <span id="page_399">p.
399</span> <span id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-Page_399"></span>Image of the First,
and because the First is in Him, and also Offspring from the Father, in
whom the whole creation is created and adopted into sonship.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p23"></span> He says that in ‘I the first’ the
question of time does not come in, else creatures would come ‘second’ to
the Creator, as if His and their duration admitted of a common measure.
‘First’ then does not imply succession, but is equivalent to <span
class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p23.2"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p23.3"></span>ρχή</span>; a word
which, as ‘Father,’ does not imply that the Son is not from eternity.

id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p24.2"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p25"></span> It is no inconsistency to say that
the Father is first, and the Son first also, for comparison or number
does not enter into mystery. Since Each is <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p25.2"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.ii-p25.3"></span>λος θεὸς</span>, Each, as contemplated by
our finite reason, at the moment of contemplation excludes the Other.
Though we ‘say’ Three Persons, Person hardly denotes one abstract
‘idea,’ certainly not as containing under it three individual subjects,
but it is a ‘term’ applied to the One God in three ways. It is the
doctrine of the Fathers, that, though we use words expressive of a
Trinity, yet that God is beyond number, and that Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, though eternally distinct from each other, can scarcely be viewed
together in common, except as ‘One’ substance, as if they could not be
generalized into Three Any whatever; and as if it were, strictly
speaking, incorrect to speak of ‘a’ Person, or otherwise than of ‘the’
Person, whether of Father, or of Son, or of Spirit. The question has
almost been admitted by S. Austin, whether it is not possible to say
that God is ‘One’ Person (*Trin.* vii. 8), for He is wholly and entirely
Father, and at the same time wholly and entirely Son, and wholly and
entirely Holy Ghost. Some references to the Fathers shall be given on
that subject, *infr.* 36 fin. vid. also *supr.* §6, n. 11. Meanwhile the
doctrine here stated will account for such expressions as ‘God from
God,’ i.e. the One God (who is the Son) from the One God (who is the
Father); vid. *supr. de Syn.* 52, note 8. Again, <span

[Next: Texts Explained; Ninthly, John x. 30; xvii. 11, &c. Arian
explanation, that the Son is one with the Father in will and judgment;
but so are all good men, nay things inanimate; contrast of the Son.
Oneness between Them is in nature, because oneness in operation. Angels
not objects of prayer, because they do not work together with God, but
the Son; texts quoted. Seeing an Angel, is not seeing God. Arians in
fact hold two Gods, and tend to Gentile polytheism. Arian explanation
that the Father and Son are one as we are one with Christ, is put aside
by the Regula Fidei, and shewn invalid by the usage of Scripture in
illustrations; the true force of the comparison; force of the terms
used. Force of 'in us;' force of 'as;' confirmed by S. John. In what
sense we are 'in God' and His 'sons.'](2040373.md)
