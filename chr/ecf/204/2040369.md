<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—<span
class="c10"><span id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p1.2"></span>Texts Explained;
Sixthly, the Context of</span> [Prov.
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p1.3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p1.4"></span>[Proverbs viii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p1.5"></span> Vz. 22–30</span> *It is right to
interpret this passage by the Regula Fidei. ‘Founded’ is used in
contrast to superstructure; and it implies, as in the case of stones in
building, previous existence. ‘Before the world’ signifies the divine
intention and purpose. Recurrence to* <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p1.6"></span>*[Prov. viii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p1.7"></span>, and application of it to created Wisdom
as seen in the works. The Son reveals the Father, first by the works,
then by the Incarnation.*

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>But</span> since the heretics, reading
the next verse, take a perverse view of that also, because it is
written, ‘He founded me before the world <span
id="fr_2709"></span>[2710](#fn_2709.md) ,’ namely, that this is said of the
Godhead of the Word and not of His incarnate Presence <span
id="fr_2710"></span>[2711](#fn_2710.md) , it is necessary, explaining this
verse also, to shew their error.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p5"></span>73. It is written, ‘The Lord in
Wisdom founded the earth <span id="fr_2711"></span>[2712](#fn_2711.md) ;’
if then by Wisdom the earth is founded, how can He who founds be
founded? nay, this too is said after the manner of proverbs <span
id="fr_2712"></span>[2713](#fn_2712.md) , and we must in like manner
investigate its sense; that we may know that, while by Wisdom the Father
frames and founds the earth to be firm and steadfast <span
id="fr_2713"></span>[2714](#fn_2713.md) , Wisdom Itself is founded for us,
that It may become beginning and foundation of our new creation and
renewal. Accordingly here as before, He says not, ‘Before the world He
hath made me Word or Son,’ lest there should be as it were a beginning
of His making. For this we must seek before all things, whether He is
Son <span id="fr_2714"></span>[2715](#fn_2714.md) , ‘and on this point
specially search the Scriptures <span
id="fr_2715"></span>[2716](#fn_2715.md) ;’ for this it was, when the
Apostles were questioned, that Peter answered, saying, ‘Thou art the
Christ, the Son of the Living God <span
id="fr_2716"></span>[2717](#fn_2716.md) .’ This also the father <span
id="fr_2717"></span>[2718](#fn_2717.md) of the Arian heresy asked as one of
his first questions; ‘If Thou be the Son of God <span
id="fr_2718"></span>[2719](#fn_2718.md) ;’ for he knew that this is the
truth and the sovereign principle of our faith; and that, if He were
Himself the Son, the tyranny of the devil would have its end; but if He
were a creature, He too was one of those descended from that Adam whom
he deceived, and he had no cause for anxiety. For the same reason the
Jews of the day <span id="fr_2719"></span>[2720](#fn_2719.md) were angered,
because the Lord said that He was Son of God, and that God was His
proper Father. For had He called Himself one of the creatures, or said,
‘I am a work,’ they had not been startled at the intelligence, nor
thought such words blasphemy, knowing, as they did, that even Angels had
come among their fathers; but since He called Himself Son, they
perceived that such was not the note of a creature, but of Godhead and
of the Father’s nature <span id="fr_2720"></span>[2721](#fn_2720.md) . The
Arians then ought, even in imitation of their own father the devil, to
take some special pains <span id="fr_2721"></span>[2722](#fn_2721.md) on
this point; and if He has said, ‘He founded me to be Word or Son,’ then
to think as they do; but if He has not so spoken, not to invent for
themselves what is not.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p17"></span>74. For He says not, ‘Before the
world He founded me as Word or Son,’ but simply, ‘He founded me,’ to
shew again, as I have said, that not for His own sake <span
id="fr_2722"></span>[2723](#fn_2722.md) but for those who are built upon
Him does He here also speak, after the way of proverbs. For this
knowing, the Apostle also writes, ‘Other foundation can no man lay than
that is laid, which is Jesus Christ; but let every man take heed how he
buildeth thereupon <span id="fr_2723"></span>[2724](#fn_2723.md) .’ And it
must be that the foundation should be such as the things built on it,
that they may admit of being well compacted together. Being then the
Word, He has not, as Word <span id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724.md) ,
any such as Himself, who may be compacted with Him; for He is
Only-begotten; but having become man, He has the like of Him, those
namely the likeness of whose flesh He has put on. Therefore according to
His manhood He is founded, that we, as precious stones, may admit of
building upon Him, and may become a temple of the Holy Ghost who
dwelleth in us. And as He is a foundation, and we stones built upon Him,
so again He is a Vine and we knit to Him as branches,—not according to
the Essence of the Godhead; for this surely is impossible; but according
to His manhood, for the branches <span id="page_389">p. 389</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-Page_389"></span>must be like the vine, since we are
like Him according to the flesh. Moreover, since the heretics have such
human notions, we may suitably confute them with human resemblances
contained in the very matter they urge. Thus He saith not, ‘He made me a
foundation,’ lest He might seem to be made and to have a beginning of
being, and they might thence find a shameless occasion of irreligion;
but, ‘He founded me.’ Now what is founded is founded for the sake of the
stones which are raised upon it; it is not a random process, but a stone
is first transported from the mountain and set down in the depth of the
earth. And while a stone is in the mountain, it is not yet founded; but
when need demands, and it is transported, and laid in the depth of the
earth, then forthwith if the stone could speak, it would say, ‘He now
founded me, who brought me hither from the mountain.’ Therefore the Lord
also did not when founded take a beginning of existence; for He was the
Word before that; but when He put on our body, which He severed and took
from Mary, then He says ‘He hath founded me;’ as much as to say, ‘Me,
being the Word, He hath enveloped in a body of earth.’ For so He is
founded for our sakes, taking on Him what is ours <span
id="fr_2725"></span>[2726](#fn_2725.md) , that we, as incorporated and
compacted and bound together in Him through the likeness of the flesh,
may attain unto a perfect man, and abide <span
id="fr_2726"></span>[2727](#fn_2726.md) immortal and incorruptible.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p23"></span>75. Nor let the words ‘before the
world’ and ‘before He made the earth’ and ‘before the mountains were
settled’ disturb any one; for they very well accord with ‘founded’ and
‘created;’ for here again allusion is made to the Economy according to
the flesh. For though the grace which came to us from the Saviour
appeared, as the Apostle says, just now, and has come when He sojourned
among us; yet this grace had been prepared even before we came into
being, nay, before the foundation of the world, and the reason why is
kindly and wonderful. It beseemed not that God should counsel concerning
us afterwards, lest He should appear ignorant of our fate. The God of
all then,—creating us by His own Word, and knowing our destinies better
than we, and foreseeing that, being made ‘good <span
id="fr_2727"></span>[2728](#fn_2727.md) ,’ we should in the event be
transgressors of the commandment, and be thrust out of paradise for
disobedience,—being loving and kind, prepared beforehand in His own
Word, by whom also He created us <span
id="fr_2728"></span>[2729](#fn_2728.md) , the Economy of our salvation;
that though by the serpent’s deceit we fell from Him, we might not
remain quite dead, but having in the Word the redemption and salvation
which was afore prepared for us, we might rise again and abide immortal,
what time He should have been created for us ‘a beginning of the ways,’
and He who was the ‘First-born of creation’ should become ‘first-born’
of the ‘brethren,’ and again should rise ‘first-fruits of the dead.’
This Paul the blessed Apostle teaches in his writings; for, as
interpreting the words of the Proverbs ‘before the world’ and ‘before
the earth was,’ he thus speaks to Timothy <span
id="fr_2729"></span>[2730](#fn_2729.md) ; ‘Be partaker of the afflictions
of the Gospel according to the power of God, who hath saved us and
called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according
to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before
the world began, but is now made manifest by the appearing of our
Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and brought to light
life <span id="fr_2730"></span>[2731](#fn_2730.md) .’ And to the Ephesians;
‘Blessed be God even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
blessed us with all spiritual blessing in heavenly places in Christ
Jesus, according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of
the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love,
having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
Himself <span id="fr_2731"></span>[2732](#fn_2731.md) .’

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p29"></span>76. How then has He chosen us,
before we came into existence, but that, as he says himself, in Him we
were represented <span id="fr_2732"></span>[2733](#fn_2732.md) beforehand?
and how at all, before men were created, did He predestinate us unto
adoption, but that the Son Himself was ‘founded before the world,’
taking on Him that economy which was for our sake? or how, as the
Apostle goes on to say, have we ‘an inheritance being predestinated,’
but that the Lord Himself was founded ‘before the world,’ inasmuch as He
had a purpose, for our sakes, to take on Him through the flesh all that
inheritance of judgment which lay against us, and we henceforth were
made sons in Him? and how did we receive it ‘before the world was,’ when
we were not yet in being, but afterwards in time, but that in Christ was
stored the grace which has reached us? Wherefore also in the Judgment,
when every one shall receive according to his conduct, He says, ‘Come,
ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world <span id="fr_2733"></span>[2734](#fn_2733.md) .’
How then, or in whom, was it prepared before we came to be, save in the
Lord who ‘before the world’ was founded for this purpose; that we, as
built upon Him, might partake, as well-compacted stones, the life and
grace which is from Him? And this took place, as natur<span
id="page_390">p. 390</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-Page_390"></span>ally suggests itself to the religious
mind, that, as I said, we, rising after our brief death, may be capable
of an eternal life, of which we had not been capable <span
id="fr_2734"></span>[2735](#fn_2734.md) , men as we are, formed of earth,
but that ‘before the world’ there had been prepared for us in Christ the
hope of life and salvation. Therefore reason is there that the Word, on
coming into our flesh, and being created in it as ‘a beginning of ways
for His works,’ is laid as a foundation according as the Father’s
will <span id="fr_2735"></span>[2736](#fn_2735.md) was in Him before the
world, as has been said, and before land was, and before the mountains
were settled, and before the fountains burst forth; that, though the
earth and the mountains and the shapes of visible nature pass away in
the fulness of the present age, we on the contrary may not grow old
after their pattern, but may be able to live after them, having the
spiritual life and blessing which before these things have been prepared
for us in the Word Himself according to election. For thus we shall be
capable of a life not temporary, but ever afterwards abide <span
id="fr_2736"></span>[2737](#fn_2736.md) and live in Christ; since even
before this our life had been founded and prepared in Christ Jesus.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p35"></span>77. Nor in any other way was it
fitting that our life should be founded, but in the Lord who is before
the ages, and through whom the ages were brought to be; that, since it
was in Him, we too might be able to inherit that everlasting life. For
God is good; and being good always, He willed this, as knowing that our
weak nature needed the succour and salvation which is from Him. And as a
wise architect, proposing to build a house, consults also about
repairing it, should it at any time become dilapidated after building,
and, as counselling about this, makes preparation and gives to the
workmen materials for a repair; and thus the means of the repair are
provided before the house; in the same way prior to us is the repair of
our salvation founded in Christ, that in Him we might even be
new-created. And the will and the purpose were made ready ‘before the
world,’ but have taken effect when the need required, and the Saviour
came among us. For the Lord Himself will stand us in place of all things
in the heavens, when He receives us into everlasting life. This then
suffices to prove that the Word of God is not a creature, but that the
sense of the passage is right <span id="fr_2737"></span>[2738](#fn_2737.md)
. But since that passage, when scrutinized, has a right sense in every
point of view, it may be well to state what it is; perhaps many words
may bring these senseless men to shame. Now here I must recur to what
has been said before, for what I have to say relates to the same proverb
and the same Wisdom. The Word has not called Himself a creature by
nature, but has said in proverbs, ‘The Lord created me;’ and He plainly
indicates a sense not spoken ‘plainly’ but latent <span
id="fr_2738"></span>[2739](#fn_2738.md) , such as we shall be able to find
by taking away the veil from the proverb. For who, on hearing from the
Framing Wisdom, ‘The Lord created me a beginning of His ways,’ does not
at once question the meaning, reflecting how that creative Wisdom can be
created? who on hearing the Only-begotten Son of God say, that He was
created ‘a beginning of ways,’ does not investigate the sense, wondering
how the Only-begotten Son can become a Beginning of many others? for it
is a dark saying <span id="fr_2739"></span>[2740](#fn_2739.md) ; but ‘a man
of understanding,’ says he, ‘shall understand a proverb and the
interpretation, the words of the wise and their dark sayings <span
id="fr_2740"></span>[2741](#fn_2740.md) .’

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p40"></span>78. Now the Only-begotten and very
Wisdom <span id="fr_2741"></span>[2742](#fn_2741.md) of God is Creator and
Framer of all things; for ‘in Wisdom hast Thou made them all <span
id="fr_2742"></span>[2743](#fn_2742.md) ,’ he says, and ‘the earth is full
of Thy creation.’ But that what came into being might not only be, but
be good <span id="fr_2743"></span>[2744](#fn_2743.md) , it pleased God that
His own Wisdom should condescend <span
id="fr_2744"></span>[2745](#fn_2744.md) to the creatures, so as to
introduce an impress and semblance of Its Image on all in common and on
each, that what was made might be manifestly wise works and worthy of
God <span id="fr_2745"></span>[2746](#fn_2745.md) . For as of the Son of
God, considered as the Word, our word is an image, so of the same Son
considered as Wisdom is the wisdom which is implanted in us an image; in
which wisdom we, having the power of knowledge and thought, become
recipients of the All-framing Wisdom; and through It we are able to know
Its Father. ‘For he who hath the Son,’ saith He, ‘hath the Father also;’
and ‘he that receiveth Me, receiveth Him that sent Me <span
id="fr_2746"></span>[2747](#fn_2746.md) .’ Such an impress then of Wisdom
being created in us, and being in all the works, with reason does the
true and framing Wisdom take to Itself what belongs to its own impress,
and say, ‘The Lord created me for His works;’ for what the wisdom in us
says, that <span id="page_391">p. 391</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-Page_391"></span>the Lord Himself speaks as if it were
His own; and, whereas He is not Himself created, being Creator, yet
because of the image of Him created in the works <span
id="fr_2747"></span>[2748](#fn_2747.md) , He says this as if of Himself.
And as the Lord Himself has said, ‘He that receiveth you, receiveth
Me <span id="fr_2748"></span>[2749](#fn_2748.md) ,’ because His impress is
in us, so, though He be not among the creatures, yet because His image
and impress is created in the works, He says, as if in His own person,
‘The Lord created me a beginning of His ways for His works.’ And
therefore has this impress of Wisdom in the works been brought into
being, that, as I said before, the world might recognise in it its own
Creator the Word, and through Him the Father. And this is what Paul
said, ‘Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for
God has shewed it unto them: for the invisible things of Him from the
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things
that are made <span id="fr_2749"></span>[2750](#fn_2749.md) .’ But if so,
the Word is not a creature in essence <span
id="fr_2750"></span>[2751](#fn_2750.md) ; but the wisdom which is in us and
so called, is spoken of in this passage in the Proverbs.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p51"></span>79. But if this too fails to
persuade them, let them tell us themselves, whether there is any wisdom
in the creatures or not <span id="fr_2751"></span>[2752](#fn_2751.md) ? If
not how is it that the Apostle complains, ‘For after that in the Wisdom
of God the world by wisdom knew not God <span
id="fr_2752"></span>[2753](#fn_2752.md) ?’ or how is it if there is no
wisdom, that a ‘multitude of wise men <span
id="fr_2753"></span>[2754](#fn_2753.md) ’ are found in Scripture? for ‘a
wise man feareth and departeth from evil <span
id="fr_2754"></span>[2755](#fn_2754.md) ;’ and ‘through wisdom is a house
builded <span id="fr_2755"></span>[2756](#fn_2755.md) ;’ and the Preacher
says, ‘A man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine;’ and he blames those who
are headstrong thus, ‘Say not thou, what is the cause that the former
days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire in wisdom
concerning this <span id="fr_2756"></span>[2757](#fn_2756.md) .’ But if, as
the Son of Sirach says, ‘He poured her out upon all His works; she is
with all flesh according to His gift, and He hath given her to them that
love Him <span id="fr_2757"></span>[2758](#fn_2757.md) ,’ and this
outpouring is a note, not of the Essence of the Very <span
id="fr_2758"></span>[2759](#fn_2758.md) Wisdom and Only-begotten, but of
that wisdom which is imaged in the world, how is it incredible that the
All-framing and true Wisdom Itself, whose impress is the wisdom and
knowledge poured out in the world, should say, as I have already
explained, as if of Itself, ‘The Lord created me for His works?’ For the
wisdom in the world is not creative, but is that which is created in the
works, according to which ‘the heavens declare the glory of God, and the
firmament sheweth His handywork <span
id="fr_2759"></span>[2760](#fn_2759.md) .’ This if men have within
them <span id="fr_2760"></span>[2761](#fn_2760.md) , they will acknowledge
the true Wisdom of God; and will know that they are made really <span
id="fr_2761"></span>[2762](#fn_2761.md) after God’s Image. And, as some son
of a king, when the father wished to build a city <span
id="fr_2762"></span>[2763](#fn_2762.md) , might cause his own name to be
printed upon each of the works that were rising, both to give security
to them of the works remaining, by reason of the show of his name on
everything, and also to make them remember him and his father from the
name, and having finished the city might be asked concerning it, how it
was made, and then would answer, ‘It is made securely, for according to
the will of my father, I am imaged in each work, for my name was made in
the works;’ but saying this, he does not signify that his own essence is
created, but the impress of himself by means of his name; in the same
manner, to apply the illustration, to those who admire the wisdom in the
creatures, the true Wisdom makes answer, ‘The Lord created me for the
works,’ for my impress is in them; and I have thus condescended for the
framing of all things.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p64"></span>80. Moreover, that the Son should be
speaking of the impress that is within us as if it were Himself, should
not startle any one, considering (for we must not shrink from
repetition <span id="fr_2763"></span>[2764](#fn_2763) .md) that, when Saul
was persecuting the Church, in which was His impress and image, He said,
as if He were Himself under persecution, ‘Saul, why persecutest thou
Me <span id="fr_2764"></span>[2765](#fn_2764.md) ?’ Therefore (as has been
said), as, supposing the impress itself of Wisdom which is in the works
had said, ‘The Lord created me for the works,’ no one would have been
startled, so, if He, the True and Framing Wisdom, the Only-begotten Word
of God, should use what belongs to His image as about Himself, namely,
‘The Lord created me for the works,’ let no one, overlooking the wisdom
created in the world and <span id="page_392">p. 392</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-Page_392"></span>in the works, think that ‘He created’
is said of the Substance of the Very <span
id="fr_2765"></span>[2766](#fn_2765.md) Wisdom, lest, diluting the wine
with water <span id="fr_2766"></span>[2767](#fn_2766.md) , he be judged a
defrauder of the truth. For It is Creative and Framer; but Its impress
is created in the works, as the copy of the image. And He says,
‘Beginning of ways,’ since such wisdom becomes a sort of beginning. and,
as it were, rudiments of the knowledge of God; for a man entering, as it
were, upon this way first, and keeping it in the fear of God (as Solomon
says <span id="fr_2767"></span>[2768](#fn_2767.md) , ‘The fear of the Lord
is the beginning of wisdom’), then advancing upwards in his thoughts and
perceiving the Framing Wisdom which is in the creation, will perceive in
It also Its Father <span id="fr_2768"></span>[2769](#fn_2768.md) , as the
Lord Himself has said, ‘He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father,’ and
as John writes, ‘He who acknowledgeth the Son, hath the Father
also <span id="fr_2769"></span>[2770](#fn_2769.md) .’ And He says, ‘Before
the world He founded me <span id="fr_2770"></span>[2771](#fn_2770.md) ,’
since in Its impress the works remain settled and eternal. Then, lest
any, hearing concerning the wisdom thus created in the works, should
think the true Wisdom, God’s Son, to be by nature a creature, He has
found it necessary to add, ‘Before the mountains, and before the earth,
and before the waters, and before all hills He begets me,’ that in
saying, ‘before every creature’ (for He includes all the creation under
these heads), He may shew that He is not created together with the works
according to Essence. For if He was created ‘for the works,’ yet is
before them, it follows that He is in being before He was created. He is
not then a creature by nature and essence, but as He Himself has added,
an Offspring. But in what differs a creature from an offspring, and how
it is distinct by nature, has been shewn in what has gone before.

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p73"></span>81. But since He proceeds to say,
‘When He prepared the heaven, I was present with Him <span
id="fr_2771"></span>[2772](#fn_2771.md) ,’ we ought to know that He says
not this as if without Wisdom the Father prepared the heaven or the
clouds above (for there is no room to doubt that all things are created
in Wisdom, and without It was made not even one <span
id="fr_2772"></span>[2773](#fn_2772) thing.md); but this is what He says,
‘All things took place in Me and through Me, and when there was need
that Wisdom should be created in the works, in My Essence indeed I was
with the Father, but by a condescension <span
id="fr_2773"></span>[2774](#fn_2773.md) to things originate, I was
disposing over the works My own impress, so that the whole world as
being in one body, might not be at variance but in concord with itself.’
All those then who with an upright understanding, according to the
wisdom given unto them, come to contemplate the creatures, are able to
say for themselves, ‘By Thy appointment all things continue <span
id="fr_2774"></span>[2775](#fn_2774.md) ;’ but they who make light of this
must be told, ‘Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools;’ for
‘that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has
revealed it unto them; for the invisible things of Him from the creation
of the world are clearly seen, being perceived by the things that are
made, even His eternal Power and Godhead, so that they are without
excuse. Because that when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God,
but served the creature more than the Creator of all, who is blessed for
ever. Amen <span id="fr_2775"></span>[2776](#fn_2775.md) .’ And they will
surely be shamed at hearing, ‘For, after that in the wisdom of God (in
the mode we have explained above), the world by wisdom knew not God, it
pleased God by the foolishness of the preaching to save them that
believe <span id="fr_2776"></span>[2777](#fn_2776.md) .’ For no longer, as
in the former times, God has willed to be known by an image and shadow
of wisdom, that namely which is in the creatures, but He has made the
true Wisdom Itself to take flesh, and to become man, and to undergo the
death of the cross; that by the faith in Him, henceforth all that
believe may obtain salvation. However, it is the same Wisdom of God,
which through Its own Image in the creatures (whence also It is said to
be created), first manifested Itself, and through Itself Its own Father;
and afterwards, being Itself the Word, has ‘become flesh <span
id="fr_2777"></span>[2778](#fn_2777.md) ,’ as John says, and after
abolishing death and saving our race, still more revealed Himself and
through Him His own Father, saying, ‘Grant unto them that they may know
Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent <span
id="fr_2778"></span>[2779](#fn_2778.md) .’

<span id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-p82"></span>82. Hence the whole earth is filled
with the knowledge of Him; for the knowledge of Father through Son and
of Son from Father is one and the same, and the Father delights in Him,
and in the same joy the Son rejoices in the Father, saying, ‘I was by
Him, daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him <span
id="fr_2779"></span>[2780](#fn_2779.md) .’ And this again proves that the
Son is not foreign, but proper to the Father’s Essence. For behold, not
because of us has He come to be, <span id="page_393">p. 393</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iii.ix-Page_393"></span>as the irreligious men say, nor is He
out of nothing (for not from without did God procure for Himself a cause
of rejoicing), but the words denote what is His own and like. When then
was it, when the Father rejoiced not? but if He ever rejoiced, He was
ever, in whom He rejoiced. And in whom does the Father rejoice, except
as seeing Himself in His own Image, which is His Word? And though in
sons of men also He had delight, on finishing the world, as it is
written in these same Proverbs <span
id="fr_2780"></span>[2781](#fn_2780.md) , yet this too has a consistent
sense. For even thus He had delight, not because joy was added to Him,
but again on seeing the works made after His own Image; so that even
this rejoicing of God is on account of His Image. And how too has the
Son delight, except as seeing Himself in the Father? for this is the
same as saying, ‘He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father,’ and ‘I am
in the Father and the Father in Me <span
id="fr_2781"></span>[2782](#fn_2781.md) .’ Vain then is your vaunt as is on
all sides shewn, O Christ’s enemies, and vainly did ye parade <span
id="fr_2782"></span>[2783](#fn_2782.md) and circulate everywhere your text,
‘The Lord created me a beginning of His ways,’ perverting its sense, and
publishing, not Solomon’s meaning, but your own comment <span
id="fr_2783"></span>[2784](#fn_2783.md) . For behold your sense is proved
to be but a fantasy; but the passage in the Proverbs, as well as all
that is above said, proves that the Son is not a creature in nature and
essence, but the proper Offspring of the Father, true Wisdom and Word,
by whom ‘all things were made,’ and ‘without Him was made not one
thing. <span id="fr_2784"></span>[2785](#fn_2784.md) ’

that Adam innocent was mortal, yet would not in fact have died; that he
