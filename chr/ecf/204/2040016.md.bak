<span id="v.ii.iv-p1"></span> §3 (2). *The situation after the Council
of Nicæa.*

<span id="v.ii.iv-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>The</span> council (a) had testified, by its
horrified and spontaneous rejection of it, that Arianism was a novelty
subversive of the Christian faith as they had received it from their
fathers. They had (b) banished it from the Church by an inexorable test,
which even the leading supporters of Arius had been induced to
subscribe. In the years immediately following, we find (c) a large
majority of the Eastern bishops, especially of Syria and Asia Minor, the
very regions whence the numerical strength of the council was drawn, in
full reaction against the council; first against the leaders of the
victorious party, eventually and for nearly a whole generation against
the symbol itself; the final victory of the latter in the East being the
result of the slow growth of conviction, a growth independent of the
authority of the council which it eventually was led to recognise. To
understand this paradox of history, which determines the whole story of
the life of Athanasius as bishop, it is necessary to estimate at some
length the theological and ecclesiastical situation at the close of the
council: this will best be done by examining each point in turn (a) the
novelty of Arianism, (b) the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p2.2"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p2.3"></span>μοούσιον</span> as a theological formula, (c)
the materials for reaction.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p3"></span>(a) ‘Arianism was a new doctrine in the
Church’ (Harnack, p. 218); but it claimed to be no novelty. And it was
successful for a long time in gaining ‘conservative’ patronage. Its
novelty, as observed above, is sufficiently shewn by its reception at
the Council of Nicæa. But no novelty springs into existence without
antecedents. What were the antecedents of Arianism? How does it stand
related to the history within the Church of the momentous question,
‘What think ye of Christ?’

<span id="v.ii.iv-p4"></span>In examining such a question, two methods
are possible. We may take as our point of departure the formulated dogma
say of Nicæa, and examine in the light of it variations in theological
statements in preceding periods, to shew that they do not warrant us in
regarding the dogma as an innovation. That is the dogmatic method. Or we
may take our start from the beginning, and trace the history of doctrine
in the order of cause and effect, so as to detect the divergence and
convergence of streams of influence, and arrive at an answer to the
question, How came men to think and speak as they did? That is the
historical method. Both methods have their recommendations, and either
has been ably applied to the problem before us. In electing the latter I
choose the more difficult road; but I do so with the conviction,
firstly, that the former has tended (and especially in the ablest hands)
to obscure our perception of the actual facts, secondly, that the saving
faith of Christ has everything to gain from a method which appeals
directly to our sense of historical truth, and satisfies, not merely
overawes, the mind.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p5"></span>Let us then go back to ‘the beginning of
the Gospel.’ Taking the synoptic gospels as our primary evidence, we
ask, what did Christ our Lord teach about Himself? We do not find formal
definitions of doctrine concerning His Person. Doubtless it may seem
that such a definition on His part would have saved infinite dispute and
searchings of heart in the history of the Church. But recognising in Him
the unique and supreme Revealer of the Father, it is not for us to say
what He should have taught; we must accept His method of teaching as
that which Divine Wisdom chose as the best, and its sequel in history as
the way in which God willed man to learn. We find then in the materials
which we possess for the history of His Life and Teaching fully enough
to explain the belief of His disciples (see below) in His Divinity.
*Firstly,* there is no serious doubt as to His claim to be the Messiah.
(The confession of Peter in all four Gospels, [Matt.
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016.md), [Mark
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#029.md), [Luke
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#027.md), [John
6:69](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#069.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p5.1"></span>;
‘Son of Man,’ [Dan. 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md), [Dan.
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p5.2"></span>,
&c.). In this character He is King in the kingdom of Heaven ([Matt.
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md), [Mark
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038)<span id="v.ii.iv-p5.3"></span>.md),
and revises the Law with full authority ([Matt.
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021.md), [Luke
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#024.md), [Matt.
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#008)<span id="v.ii.iv-p5.4"></span>.md).
It may be added that whatever this claim conveyed to the Jews of His own
time (see Stanton’s *Jewish and Christian Messiah*) it is impossible to
combine in one idea the Old Testament traits of the Coming One if we
stop short of the identification of the Messiah with the God of Israel
(see Delitzsch, *Psalms,* vol. i. pp. 94, 95, last English ed.).
*Secondly,* Christ enjoys *and confers* the full authority of God
([Matt. 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040.md), [Luke
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016.md), [Matt.
24:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#035.md), [Mark
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#031.md), [Luke
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#033)<span id="v.ii.iv-p5.5"></span>.md),
gives and promises the Holy Spirit (‘the Spirit *of the Father,*’ see
[Matt. 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017.md), [Luke
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#012.md), [Luke
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#015.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p5.6"></span>,
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p5.7"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p5.8"></span>γὼ γὰρ δώσω</span>, &c.),
and apparently sends the prophets and holy men of old (cf. [Matt.
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034.md), [Luke
11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p5.9"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p5.10"></span></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p5.11"></span></span>). *Thirdly,* the foundation of all
this is laid in a passage preserved by the first and third gospels, in
which He claims the unqualified possession of the mind of the Father
(<span id="v.ii.iv-p5.12"></span>Luke x. 22; <span id="page_xxii">p.
xxii</span> <span id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxii"></span>Matt. xi. 27), ‘No man
knoweth \[who\] the Son \[is\], save the Father, neither knoweth any man
\[who\] the Father \[is\] save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son
will (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p5.13"></span>βούληται</span>) reveal Him.’ Observe the
*reciprocity* of knowledge between the Son and the Father. This claim is
a decisive *instantia fœderis* between the Synoptics and the Fourth
Gospel, e.g. [John 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#015.md), [John
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p5.14"></span>,
&c. *Fourthly,* we observe the claim made by Him throughout the synoptic
record to absolute confidence, absolute faith, obedience,
self-surrender, such as no frail man is justified in claiming from
another; the absence of any trace in the mind of the ‘meek and lowly’
one of that consciousness of sin, that need of reconciliation with God,
which is to us an indispensable condition of the religious temper, and
the starting-point of Christian faith (contrast [Isa. vi.
5](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005)<span id="v.ii.iv-p5.15"></span>.md).

<span id="v.ii.iv-p6"></span>We now turn to the Apostles. Here a few
brief remarks must suffice. (A suggestive summary in Sanday, ‘What the
first Christians thought about Christ,’ *Oxford House Papers, First
Series.*) That S. Paul’s summary of the Gospel ([1 Cor. xv.
3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p6.1"></span>
*sqq.*) is given by him as common ground between himself and the older
Apostles follows strictly from the fact that the verb used (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p6.2"></span>παρέλαβον</span>) links the
facts of Redemption ([1 Cor. 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#004)<span id="v.ii.iv-p6.3"></span>.md)
with the personal experiences of the original disciples ([1 Cor.
15.5](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p6.4"></span>
*sqq.*). In fact it is not in dispute that the original Jewish nucleus
of the Apostolic Church preached Jesus as the Messiah, and His death as
the ground of forgiveness of sins (Pfleiderer, *Urchrist.* p. 20; [Acts
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036.md),
[38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md), [Acts
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026.md), [Acts
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p6.5"></span>,
&c.; the ‘Hebraic colouring’ of these early chapters is very
characteristic and important). The question is, however, how much this
implied as to the Divine Personality of the Saviour; how far the belief
of the Apostles and their contemporaries was uniform and explicit on
this point. Important light is thrown on this question by the
controversy which divided S. Paul from the mass of Jewish Christians
with respect to the observance of the Law. Our primary source of
knowledge here is [Gal. 2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#000.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p6.6"></span>. We there learn that while S. Paul regarded
this question as involving the whole essence of the Gospel, and resisted
every attempt to impose circumcision on Gentile Christians, the older
Apostles conceded the one point regarded as central, and, while
reserving the obligation of the Law on those born under it (which S.
Paul never directly assailed, [1 Cor. vii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#018)<span id="v.ii.iv-p6.7"></span>.md)
recognised the Gospel of the uncircumcision as legitimate. This
concession, as the event proved, conceded everything; if the ‘gospel of
the uncircumcision’ was sufficient for salvation, circumcision became a
national, not a religious principle. Now this whole question was
fundamentally a question about Christ. Men who believed, or were willing
to grant, that the Law uttered from Sinai by the awful voice of the Most
High Himself was no longer the supreme revelation of God, the one
divinely ordained covenant of righteousness, certainly believed that
some revelation of God different *in kind* (for no revelation of God
*to* man could surpass the *degree* of [Ex. xxxiii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011)<span id="v.ii.iv-p6.8"></span>.md) had
taken place, an unique revelation of God *in* man. The revelation of God
in Christ, not the revelation of God to Moses, was the one fact in the
world’s history; Sinai was dwarfed in comparison of Calvary. But it must
be observed that while the older Apostles, by the very recognition of
the gospel of the uncircumcision, went thus far with S. Paul, S. Paul
realised as a central principle what to others lay at the circumference.
What to the one was a *result* of their belief in Christ was to him the
starting-point, from which logical conclusions were seen to follow,
practical applications made in every direction. At the same time S. Paul
taught nothing about Christ that was not *implied* in the belief of the
older Apostles, or that they would not have felt impelled by their own
religious position to accept. In fact it was their fundamental union in
the implicit belief of the divinity of the Lord that made possible any
agreement between S. Paul and the Jewish Apostles as to the gospel of
the uncircumcision.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p7"></span>The apostles of the circumcision, however,
stood between S. Paul and the zealot mass of Jewish Christians ([Acts
xxi. 20](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p7.1"></span>), many of whom were far from acquiescing in
the recognition of S. Paul’s Gospel. On the same principle that we have
used to determine the belief of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p7.2"></span>Στῦλοι</span> with regard to Christ, we must
needs recognise that where the gospel of the uncircumcision was still
assailed or disparaged, the Divinity of Christ was apprehended faintly,
or not at all.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p8"></span>The name of the ‘Ebionite’ sect testifies
to its continuity with a section of the Jerusalem Church (see
Lightfoot’s Galatians, *S. Paul and the Three*). It should be observed,
however, firstly that between the clear-sighted Apostle of the Gentiles
and the straitest of the zealots, there lay every conceivable gradation
of intermediate positions (Loofs, *Leitf.* §11. 2, 3); secondly, that
while emancipation from legalism in the Apostolic Church implied what
has been said above, a belief in the divinity of Jesus was in itself
compatible with strict Jewish observance.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p9"></span>The divinity of Christ then was firmly held
by S. Paul (the most remarkable passage is [Rom.
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p9.1"></span>,
where <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p9.2"></span>Κύριον
᾽Ιησοῦν</span> = <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p9.3"></span>αὐτόν</span> = <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p9.4"></span>Κύριον</span> = הוהי [Joel ii.
32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032)<span id="v.ii.iv-p9.5"></span>.md),
and his belief was held by him in common with the Jewish Apostles,
although with a clearer illumination as to its consequences. That this
belief was absolutely universal in the Church is not to be maintained,
the elimination of Ebionism was only gradual (Justin, *Dial.* xlviii.
*ad fin.*); but that it, and not Ebionism, represented the common belief
of the Apostles and New Testament writers is not to be doubted.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p10"></span>But taking this as proved, we do not find
an equally clear answer to the question *In what sense* is Christ God?
The synoptic record makes no *explicit* reference to the pre-existence
of Christ: but the witness of John and descent of the Spirit ([Mark i.
7-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#007)<span id="v.ii.iv-p10.1"></span>.md)
at His baptism, coupled with the Virginal Birth ([Matt.
1:0](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#000.md), [Luke
1:0](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#000)<span id="v.ii.iv-p10.2"></span>.md),
*and with the traits of the synoptic portrait of Christ* as collected
above, if they do not compel us to assert, yet forbid us to deny the
presence of this doctrine to the minds of the Evangelists. In the
Pauline (including Hebrews) and Johannine writings the doctrine is
strongly marked, and in the latter ([John
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p10.3"></span>,
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p10.4"></span>μονογενὴς
Θεός</span>) Jesus Christ is expressly identified with the creative Word
(Palestinian *Memra,* rather than Alexandrian or from Philo; see also
[Rev. xix. 13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p10.5"></span>), and the Word with God. Moreover such
passages as [Phil. 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md), [2 Cor.
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p10.6"></span>
(the Apostolic benediction), &c., &c., are significant of the impression
left upon the mind of the infant Churches as they started upon their
history no longer under the personal guidance of the Apostles of the
Lord.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p11"></span>Jesus Christ was God, was one with the
Father and with the Spirit: that was enough for the faith, the love, the
conduct of the primitive Church. The Church was nothing so little as a
society of theologians; monotheists and worshippers of Christ by the
same instinct, to analyse their faith as an intellectual problem was far
from their thoughts: God Himself (and there is but one God) had suffered
for them (Ign. *Rom*. vi.; Tat. *Gr.* 13; Melito *Fr.* 7), God’s
sufferings were before their eyes (Clem. R. I. ii. 1), they desired the
drink of God, even His blood (Ign. *Rom*. vii., cf. [Acts xx.
28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028)<span id="v.ii.iv-p11.1"></span>.md);
if enthusiastic devotion gave way for a moment to reflexion ‘we must
think of Jesus Christ as of God’ (‘Clem. R.’ II. 1).

<span id="v.ii.iv-p12"></span>The ‘Apostolic fathers’ are not
theological in their aim or method. The earliest seat of theological
reflexion in the primitive Church appears to have been Asia Minor, or
rather Western Asia from Antioch to the Ægean. From this region proceed
the Ignatian letters, which stand alone among the literature of their
day in theological depth and reflexion. Their theology ‘is wonderfully
mature in spite of its immaturity, full of reflexions, and yet <span
id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span> <span id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxiii"></span>at
the same time full of intuitive originality’ (Loofs, p. 61). The central
idea is that of the renovation of man (*Eph*. 20), now under the power
of Satan and *Death* (ib. 3, 19), which are undone (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p12.1"></span>κατάλυσις</span>) in
Christ, the risen Saviour (*Smyrn.* 3), who is ‘our true Life,’ and
endows us with immortality (*Smyrn.* 4, *Magn.* 6, *Eph.* 17). This is
by virtue of His Divinity (*Eph.* 19, *Smyrn.* 4) in union with His
perfect Manhood. He is the only utterance of God (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p12.2"></span>λόγος ἀπὸ σιγῆς
προελθών</span>, *Magn.* 8), the ‘unlying mouth by which the Father
spake’ (*Rom*. 8.) ‘God come (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p12.3"></span>γενόμενος</span>) in the flesh,’ ‘our God’
(*Eph*. 7, 18). His flesh partaken mystically in the Eucharist unites
our nature to His, is the ‘medicine of incorruption’ (*Eph.* 20,
*Smyrn.* 7, cf. *Trall.* 1). Ignatius does not distinguish the relation
of the divine to the human in Christ: he is content to insist on both:
‘one Physician, of flesh and of spirit, begotten and unbegotten’ (*Eph.*
7). Nor does he clearly conceive the relation of the Eternal Son to the
Father. He is unbegotten (as God) and begotten (as man): from eternity
with the Father (*Magn.* 6): through Him the One God manifested himself.
The theological depth of Ignatius was perhaps in part called forth by
the danger to the churches from the Docetic heretics, representative of
a Judaic (*Philad.* 5, *Magn.* 8–10) syncretism which had long had a
hold in Asia Minor (<span id="v.ii.iv-p12.4"></span>1 John and Lightfoot
*Coloss.,* p. 73, 81 *sqq.*). To this he opposes what is evidently a
*creed* (*Trall.* 9), with emphasis on the reality (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p12.5"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p12.6"></span>ληθῶς</span>) of all the
facts of Redemption comprised in it.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p13"></span>It was in fact the controversies of the
second century that produced a theology in the Catholic Church,—that in
a sense produced the Catholic Church itself. The idea of the Church as
distinct from and embracing the Churches is a New Testament idea ([Eph.
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md), [1 Cor.
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p13.1"></span>,
&c.), and the name ‘Catholic’ occurs at the beginning of the second
century (Lightfoot’s note on Ign. *Smyrn.* 8); but the Gnostic and
Montanist controversies compelled the Churches which held fast to the
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p13.2"></span>παράδοσις</span> of
the Apostles to close their ranks (episcopal federation) and to reflect
upon their creed. The Baptismal Creed ([Rom.
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009.md), [Acts
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#037.md), [1 Cor.
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003)<span id="v.ii.iv-p13.3"></span>.md)
began to serve as a *tessera* or passport of right belief, and as a
regulative standard, a ‘rule of faith.’ The ‘limits of the Christian
Church’ began to be more clearly defined (Stanton, *ubi supr.* p. 167).

<span id="v.ii.iv-p14"></span>Another influence which during the same
period led to a gradual formation of theology was the necessity of
defending the Church against heathenism. If the Gnostics were ‘the first
Christian theologians’ (Harnack), the <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p14.1"></span>Apologists</span> (120–200) are more directly
important for our present enquiry. The usual title of Justin
‘Philosopher and Martyr’ is significant of his position and typical of
the class of writers to which he belongs. On the one hand the Apologists
are philosophers rather than theologians. Christianity is ‘the only true
philosophy’ (Justin); its doctrines are found piecemeal among the
philosophers (<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p14.2"></span>λόγος
σπερματικός</span>), who are so far Christians, just as the Christians
are the true philosophers (Justin and Minuc. Felix). But the Logos, who
is imparted fragmentarily to the philosophers, is revealed in His entire
divine Personality in Christ (so Justin beyond the others, *Apol*. ii.
8, 10). In the doctrine of God, their thought is coloured by the
eclectic Platonism of the age before Plotinus. God, the Father of all
things, is Creator, Lord, Master, and *as such* known to man, but in
Himself Unoriginate (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p14.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p14.4"></span>γένητος</span>), ineffable, mysterious (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p14.5"></span>ἄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p14.6"></span>ρρητος</span>), without a
name, One and alone, incapable of Incarnation (for references to Justin
and to Plato, D.C.B. iii. 572). His ‘goodness’ is metaphysical
perfection, or beneficence to man, His ‘righteousness’ that of Moral
Governor of the Universe (contrast the deeper sense of St. Paul, [Rom.
iii. 21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p14.7"></span>, &c.). But the abstractness of the conception
of God gives way to personal vividness in the doctrine of the ‘visible
God’ (Tert. *Prax.* 15 sq.), the Logos (the subject of the O.T.
‘theophanies’ according to the Apologists) who was ‘with’ the Father
before all things (Just. *Dial.* 62), but was ‘begotten’ or projected
(<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p14.8"></span>προβληθεις</span>)
by the will of the Father (ib. 128) as God from God, as a flame from
fire. He is, like the Father, ineffable (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p14.9"></span>Χριστός</span>, Just. *Apol*. ii. 6), yet is
the <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p14.10"></span>ἄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p14.11"></span>γγελος, ὑπηρέτης</span>
of the Father. In particular He is the Father’s minister *in Creation:*
to create He proceeded from the Father, a doctrine expressly deduced
from [Prov. viii. 22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p14.12"></span> (*Dial.* 61, 129). Before this He was the
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p14.13"></span>λόγος
ἐνδιάθετος</span>, after it the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p14.14"></span>λόγος προφορικός</span>, the Word uttered
([Ps. xlv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p14.15"></span> LXX; this distinction is not in Justin, but
is found Theophil. *ad Autol.* ii. 10, 22: it is the most marked trace
of philosophic \[Stoic\] influence on the Apologists). The Apologists,
then, conceive of Christian theology *as philosophers.* Especially the
Person of the Saviour is regarded by them from the cosmological, not the
soteriological view-point. From the latter, as we have seen, St. Paul
starts; and his view gradually embraces the distant horizon of the
former ([1 Cor. 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006.md), [Col.
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p14.16"></span>); from the soteriological side also
(*directly*) he reaches the divinity of Christ ([Rom.
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001.md), [1 Cor.
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030.md), [Rom.
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p14.17"></span>, *as above*). Here, as we shall see,
Athanasius meets the Arians substantially by St. Paul’s method. But the
Apologists, under the influence of their philosophy rather than of their
religion, start from the cosmological aspect of the problem. They
engraft upon an Apostolic (Johannine) title of the Saviour an
Alexandrine group of associations: they go far towards transmuting the
Word of St. John to the Logos of Philo and the Eclectics. Hence their
view of His Divinity and of his relation to the Father is embarrassed.
His eternity and His generation are felt to be hardly compatible: His
distinct Personality is maintained at the expense of His true Divinity.
He is God, and not the One God; He can manifest Himself (Theophanies) in
a way the One God cannot; He is an intermediary between God and the
world. The question has become philosophical rather than directly
religious, and philosophy cannot solve it. But on the other hand, Justin
was no Arian. If he was Philosopher, he was also Martyr. The Apologists
are deeply saturated with Christian piety and personal enthusiastic
devotion to Christ. Justin in particular introduces us, as no other so
early writer, into the life, the worship, the simple faith of the
Primitive Church, and we can trace in him influences of the deeper
theology of Asia Minor (Loofs, p. 72 *sq.* but see more fully the noble
article on Justin in D.C.B. vol. iii.). But our concern is with their
influence on the analysis of the object of faith; and here we see that
unconsciously they have severed the Incarnate Son from the Eternal
Father: not God (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p14.18"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p14.19"></span>ὄντως θεός</span>) but a *subordinate* divine
being is revealed in Christ: the Logos, to adopt the words of Ignatius,
is no longer a true breach of the Divine Silence.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p15"></span>We must now glance at the important period
of developed Catholicism marked especially by the names of <span
class="c10"><span id="v.ii.iv-p15.1"></span>Irenæus,</span> <span
class="c10"><span id="v.ii.iv-p15.2"></span>Tertullian,</span> and <span
class="c10"><span id="v.ii.iv-p15.3"></span>Clement,</span> the period
of a consolidated organisation, a (relatively) fixed Canon of the New
Testament, and a catholic rule of faith (see above, and Lumby, *Creeds,*
ch. i.; Heurtley, *Harmonia Symbolica,* i.–viii.). The problem of the
period which now begins (180–250) was that of <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p15.4"></span>Monarchianism;</span> the Divinity of Christ
must be reconciled with the Unity of God. Monarchianism is in itself the
expression of the truth common to all monotheism, that the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p15.5"></span>ἄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p15.6"></span>ρχη</span> or Originative
Principle is strictly and Personally One and one only (in contrast to
the plurality of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p15.7"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p15.8"></span>ρχικαὶ ὑποστάσεις</span>, see Newman,
*Arians*4, p. 112 note). No Christian deliberately maintains the
contrary. The Apologists, as we have seen, tended to emphasise the
distinction of Father and Son; but this tendency makes of necessity in
the direction of ‘subordination;’ and *any* distinction of ‘Persons’ or
Hypostases in the Godhead involves to a Monotheist *some* subordination,
in order to save the principle <span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span> <span
id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxiv"></span>of the Divine Monarchia.’ The Monarchian
denied *any* subordination or distinction of hypostases within the
Godhead. This tendency we have now to follow up. We do not meet with it
as a problem in <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p15.9"></span>Irenæus.</span> (He ‘is said to have written
against it,’ Newman, *Ar.*4, p. 117, citing Dodw. *in Iren.*) This
scholar of pupils of Apostles stands in the lines of the Asiatic
theology. He is the successor of Ignatius and Polycarp. We find him, in
sharp contrast to the Apologists, giving full expression to the
revelation of God in Jesus (the ‘Son is the Measure of the Father, for
He contains Him’), and the union of man with God in the Saviour, as the
carrying out of the original destiny of man, by the destruction of sin,
which had for the time frustrated it (III. xviii. p. 211, Deus antiquam
hominis plasmationem in se recapitulans). Hence the ‘deification’ of
man’s nature by union with Christ (a remarkable point of contact with
Athanasius, see note on *de Incar.* 54. 3); incorruption is attained to
by the knowledge of God (cf. [John xvii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003)<span id="v.ii.iv-p15.10"></span>.md)
through faith ([John 4.20](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#020.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p15.11"></span>.); we cannot comprehend God, but we learn to
know Him by His Love ([John 4.20](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#020.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p15.12"></span>.). At the same time we trace the influence
of the Apologists here and there in his Christology (III. 6, 19, and the
explanation of the ‘Theophanies,’ iv. 20). But in his younger
contemporary <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p15.13"></span>Tertullian,</span> the reaction of
Monarchianism makes itself felt. He is himself one of the Apologists,
and at the same time under *Asiatic* influences. The two trains of
influence converge in the name *Trinitas,* which he is the first to use
(<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p15.14"></span>τρίας</span> first
in the *Asiatic* Apologist Theophilus). In combating the Monarchian
Praxeas (see below) he carries subordinationism very far (cf. *Hermog.*
3. ‘fuit tempus cum Ei filius non fuit’), he distinguishes the Word as
‘rationalis deus’ from eternity, and ‘sermonalis’ not from eternity (cf.
again, Theophilus, *supra*). The Generation of the Son is a <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p15.15"></span>προβολή</span> (also
‘eructare’ from [Ps. xlv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p15.16"></span>), but the divine ‘Substance’ remains the
same (river and fountain, sun and ray, *Prax.* 8, 9). He aims at
reconciling ‘subordination’ with the ‘Monarchia,’ (ib. 4). In the
Incarnate Christ he distinguishes the divine and human as accurately as
Leo the Great (ib. 27, 29). In spite of inconsistencies such as were
inevitable in his strange individuality (Stoic, philosopher, lawyer,
Apologist, ‘Asiatic’ theologian, Catholic, Montanist) we see in
Tertullian the starting-point of Latin Theology (but see also Harnack
ii. 287 note).

<span id="v.ii.iv-p16"></span>We must now examine more closely the
history of <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p16.1"></span>Monarchian</span> tendencies, and firstly in
<span class="c10"><span id="v.ii.iv-p16.2"></span>Rome.</span> The
sub-Apostolic Church, simply holding the Divinity of Christ and the
Unity of God, used language (see above) which may be called ‘naively
Monarchian.’ This holds good even of Asiatic theology, as we find it in
its earlier stage. The baptismal creed (as we find it in the primitive
basis of the Apostles’ Creed) does not solve the problem thus presented
to Christian reflexion. Monarchianism attempted the solution in two
ways. *Either* the One God was simply identified with the Christ of the
Gospels and the Creeds, the Incarnation being a *mode* of the Divine
manifestation (Father as Creator, Son as Redeemer, Spirit as Sanctifier,
or the like): ‘Modalism’ or Modalistic Monarchianism (including
Patripassianism, Sabellianism, and later on the theology of Marcellus);
*or* (this being felt incompatible with the constant personal
distinction of Christ from the Father) a special effluence, influence,
or power of the one God was conceived of as residing in the man Jesus
Christ, who was accordingly *Son* of God by *adoption,* God by
assimilation: ‘dynamic’ Monarchianism or Adoptionism (‘Son’ and ‘Spirit’
not so much modes of the Divine self-realisation as of the Divine
*Action*). This letter, the echo but not the direct survival of
Ebionism, was later on the doctrine of Photinus; we shall find it
exemplified in Paul of Samosata; but our present concern is with its
introduction at Rome by the two Theodoti, the elder of whom (a tanner
from Byzantium) was excommunicated by Bishop Victor, while the younger,
a student of the Peripatetic philosophy and grammatical interpreter of
Scripture, taught there in the time of Zephyrinus. A later
representative of this school, Artemon, claimed that its opinions were
those of the Roman bishops down to Victor (Eus. *H. E.* v. 28). This
statement cannot be accepted seriously; but it appears to be founded on
a real reminiscence of an epoch in the action and teachings of the Roman
bishops at the time. It must be remembered that the two forms of
Monarchianism—modalism and adoptionism—are, while very subtly
distinguished in their essential principle, violently opposed in their
appearance to the popular apprehension. Their doctrine of God is one, at
least in its strict unitarianism; but while to the Modalist Christ is
the one God, to the Adoptionist He is essentially and exclusively
man. <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) In the one case His
Personality is divine, in the other human. Now there is clear proof of a
strong Modalist tendency <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md) in the
Roman Church at this time; this would manifest itself in especial zeal
against the doctrine of such men as Theodotus the younger, and give some
colour to the tale of Artemon. Both Tertullian and Hippolytus complain
bitterly of the ignorance of those responsible for the ascendancy which
this teaching acquired in Rome (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p18.1"></span>Ζεφυρῖνον ἄνδρα ἰδιώτην καὶ ἄπειρον τῶν
ἐκκλησιαστικῶν ὅρων</span>, Hipp. ‘*idiotes* quisque aut perversus,’
‘simplices, ne dicam *imprudentes et idiotæ.*’ Tert.). The utterances of
Zephyrinus support this: ‘I believe in one God, Jesus Christ’ (Hipp.,
see above on the language of the sub-Apost. Church). The Monarchian
influences were strengthened by the arrival of fresh teachers from Asia
(Cleomenes and Epigonus, see note 2) and began to arouse lively
opposition. This was headed by Hippolytus, the most learned of the Roman
presbytery, and eventually bishop <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md)
in opposition to Callistus, the successor of Zephyrinus. The theology of
Hippolytus was not unlike that of Tertullian, and was hotly charged by
Callistus with ‘Ditheism.’ The position of Callistus himself, like that
of his predecessor, was one of compromise between the two forms of
Monarchianism, but somewhat more developed. A distinction was made
between ‘Christ’ (the divine) and Jesus (the human); the latter suffered
actually, the former indirectly (‘filius patitur, pater vero
compatitur.’ (Tert.) <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p19.2"></span>τὸν Πατέρα συμπεπονθέναι τῷ υἱ& 254·</span>,
Hipp.; it is clear that under ‘Praxeas’ Tertullian is combating also the
modified Praxeanism of Callistus. See *adv. Prax.* 27, 29; Hipp. ix. 7);
not without reason does Hippolytus charge Callistus with combining the
errors of Sabellius with those of Theodotus. The compromise of Callistus
was only partially successful. On the one hand the <span
id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span> <span id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxv"></span>strictly
modalist <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p19.3"></span>Sabellius</span>, who from about 215 takes the
place of Cleomenes at the head of Roman Monarchianism (his doctrine of
the <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p19.4"></span>υἱοπάτωρ</span>,
of the Trinity as successive <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p19.5"></span>πρόσωπα</span>, ‘aspects,’ of the One God,
pure modalism as defined above) scorned compromise (he constantly
reproached Callistus with having changed his front, *Hipp.*) was
excommunicated, and became the head of a sect. And the fierce opposition
of Hippolytus failed to command the support of more than a limited
circle of enthusiastic admirers, or to maintain itself after his death.
On the other hand (the process is quite in obscurity: see Harnack1, p.
620) the theology of Hippolytus and Tertullian eventually gained the
day. <span class="c10"><span id="v.ii.iv-p19.6"></span>Novatian,</span>
whose ‘grande volumen’ (Jer.) on the Trinity represents the theology of
Rome about 250 <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p19.7"></span>a.d.</span>, simply ‘epitomises Tertullian,’
and that *in explanation of the Rule of Faith.* As to the Generation of
the Son, he drops the ‘quando Ipse \[Pater\] voluit’ of Tertullian, but
like him combines a (modified) ‘subordination’ with the ‘*communio*
substantiæ’—in other words the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p19.8"></span>ὁμοούσιον</span>. Monarchianism was condemned
in the West; its further history belongs to the East (under the name of
Sabellianism first in Libya: see pp. 173, *sqq.*). But the hold which it
maintained upon the Roman Church for about a generation (190–220) left
its mark. Rome condemned Origen, the ally of Hippolytus; Rome was
invoked against Dionysius of Alexandria; (Rome and) the West formulated
the <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p19.9"></span>ὁμοούσιον</span>
at Nicæa; Rome received Marcellus; Rome rejected the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p19.10"></span>τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις</span>
and supported the Eustathians at Antioch; it was with Rome rather than
with the prevalent theology of the East that Athanasius felt himself
one. (Cf. also Harnack, *Dg.* 11, p. 622 *sqq.*) Monarchianism was too
little in harmony with the New Testament, or with the traditional
convictions of the Churches, to live as a formulated theology. The
‘naive modalism’ of the ‘simplices quae major semper pars credentium
est’ (Tert.) was corrected as soon as the attempt was made to give it
formal expression <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md) . But the attempt
to do so was a valuable challenge to the *conception of God* involved in
the system of the Apologists. To their abstract, transcendent,
philosophical first Principle, Monarchianism opposed a living,
self-revealing, redeeming God, made known in Christ. This was a great
gain. But it was obtained at the expense of the divine immutability. A
God who passed through phases or modes, now Father, now Son, now Spirit,
a God who could suffer, was not the God of the Christians. There is some
justice in Tertullian’s scoff at their ‘Deum versipellem.’

<span id="v.ii.iv-p21"></span>The third great name associated with the
end of the second century, that of Clement, is important to us chiefly
as that of the teacher of <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p21.1"></span>Origen,</span> whose influence we must now
attempt to estimate. Origen (185–254) was the first theologian in the
full sense of the term; the first, that is, to erect upon the basis of
the rule of faith (Preface to *de Princ.*) a complete theological
system, synthesising revealed religion with a theory of the Universe, of
God, of man, which should take into account the entire range of truth
and knowledge, of faith and philosophy. And in this sense for the
Eastern Church he was the last theologian as well. In the case of Origen
the Vincentian epigram, *absolvuntur magistri condemnantur discipuli*
(too often applicable in the history of doctrine) is reversed. In a
modified form his theology from the first took possession of the Eastern
Church; in the Cappadocian fathers it took out a new lease of power, in
spite of many vicissitudes it conquered opposing forces (the sixth
general council crushed the party who had prevailed at the fifth); John
of Damascus, in whom the Eastern Church says its last word, depends upon
the Origenist theology of Basil and the Gregories. But this theology was
Origenism *with a difference.* What was the Origenism *of Origen?* To
condense into the compass of our present purpose the many-sidedness of
Origen is a hopeless task. The reader will turn to the fifth and sixth
of Bigg’s *Bampton Lectures* for the best recent presentation; to
Newman’s *Arians* (I. §3), especially the ‘apology’ at the end); to
Harnack (ed. 1, pp. 510–556) and Loofs (§28); Shedd (vol. i. 288–305,
should be read before Bigg and corrected by him) and Dorner; to the
sections in Bull (*Defens.* ii. 9, iii. 3) and Petavius (who in *Trin.*
I. iv. pursues with fluent malignity ‘omnigenis errorum portentis
infamem scriptorem’); to the *Origeniana* of Huet and the dissertations
of the standard editors; to the article <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p21.2"></span>Origenist Controversies</span>, and to the
comprehensive, exact, and sympathetic article <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p21.3"></span>Origen</span> in the Dictionary of Christian
Biography. The fundamental works of Origen for our purpose are the *de
Principiis,* the *contra Celsum,* and the *de Oratione;* but the
exegetical works are necessary to fill out and correct first
impressions.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p22"></span>The general position of Origen with regard
to the Person of Christ is akin to that of Hippolytus and Tertullian. It
is to some extent determined by opposition to Gnosticism and to
Monarchianism. His visit to Rome (Eus. *H. E.,* vi. 14) coincided with
the battle of Hippolytus against Zephyrinus and his destined successor:
on practical as well as on doctrinal points he was at one with
Hippolytus. His doctrine of God is reached by the soteriological rather
than the cosmological method. God is known to us in the Incarnate Word;
‘his point of view is moral, not…pseudo-metaphysical.’ The impassibility
of the abstract philosophical idea of God is broken into by ‘the passion
of Love’ (Bigg, p. 158). In opposition to the perfection of God lies the
material world, conditioned by evil, the result of the exercise of will.
This cause of evil is antecedent to the genesis of the material
universe, the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p22.1"></span>καταβολὴ κόσμου</span>; materiality is the
penalty and measure of evil. (This part of Origen’s doctrine is markedly
Platonic. Plotinus, we read, refused to observe his own birthday; in
like manner Origen quaintly notes that only wicked men are recorded in
Scripture to have kept their birthdays; Bigg, 203, note; cf. Harnack, p.
523, note.) The soul (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p22.2"></span>ψυχή</span> as if from <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p22.3"></span>ψύχεσθαι</span>) has in a
previous state ‘waxed cold,’ i.e. lost its original integrity, and in
this condition enters the body, i.e. ‘is subjected to vanity’ in common
with the rest of the creature, and needs redemption (qualify this by
Bigg, pp. 202 *sqq.,* on Origen’s belief in Original Sin). To meet this
need the Word takes a Soul (but one that has never swerved from Him in
its pre-existent state: on this antinomy Bigg, 190, note, 199) and
*mediante Anima,* or rather mediante *hac substantia animæ* (*Prin.* II.
vi.) unites the nature of God and of Man in One. (On the union of the
two natures in the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p22.4"></span>θεάνθρωπος</span>, in *Ezek.* iii. 3, he is as
precise as Tertullian: we find the *Hypostatic Union* and *Communicatio
Idiomatum* formally explicit; Bigg, 190.) The Word ‘deifies’ Human
Nature, first His Own, then in others as well (*Cels.* iii. 28, <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p22.5"></span>ἵ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p22.6"></span>να γένητυι θεία</span>: he
does not use <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p22.7"></span>θεοποιεῖσθαι</span>; the thought is subtly but
really different from that which we found in Irenæus: see Harnack, p.
551), by that perfect apprehension of Him <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p22.8"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p22.9"></span>περ ἦν πρὶν γένηται σάρξ</span>, of which
faith in the Incarnate is the earliest but not the final stage (applying
[2 Cor. v. 16](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p22.10"></span>; cf. the Commentary on the Song of Songs).

<span id="v.ii.iv-p23"></span>What account then does Origen give of the
beginning and the end of the great Drama of existence? He starts from
the end, which is the more clearly revealed; ‘God shall be all in all.’
But ‘the end must be like the beginning;’ One is the end of all, One is
the beginning. From [1 Cor. xv](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#000.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p23.1"></span>. he works back to [Romans
viii](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#000.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p23.2"></span>.:
the one is his key to the eternity after, the other, to the eternity
before (Bigg pp. 193 *sq.*). Into this scheme he brings creation, evil,
the history of Revelation, the Church and its life, the final
consummation of all things. <span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span> <span
id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxvi"></span>The Universe is eternal: God is prior to
it in conception, yet He was never other than Creator. But in the
history of the Universe the material world which we know is but a small
episode. It began, and will end. It began with the estrangement of Will
from God, will end with its reconciliation: God, from Whom is the
beginning of all, ‘will be all in all.’ (For Origen’s eschatology see
Bigg, 228–234.) From this point of view we must approach the two-sided
Christology of Origen. To him the two sides were aspects of the same
thing: but if the subtle presupposition as to God and the Universe is
withdrawn, they become alternative and inconsistent Christologies, as we
shall see to have actually happened. As God is eternally Creator, *so He
is eternally Father* (Bigg, 160, note). The Son proceeds from Him not as
*a part* of His Essence, but as the Ray from the Light; it cannot be
rightly or piously said that He had a beginning, <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p23.3"></span>ἦν ὅτε οὐκ ἦν</span> (cf.
*De Princ.* i. 2, iv. 28, and *infr.* p. 168); He is begotten *from the
Essence* of the Father, He is *of the same essence* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p23.4"></span>ὁμοούσιος</span>)
(*Fragm.* 3 *in Heb.,* but see Bigg, p. 179), there is *no unlikeness*
whatever between the Son and the Father (*Princ.* i. 2, 12). He was
begotten <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p23.5"></span>ἐκ τοῦ
θελήματος τοῦ Πατρός</span> (but to Origen the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p23.6"></span>θέλημα</span> was inherent in the Divine
Nature, cf. Bigg. 161, Harnack, p. 534 against Shedd, p. 301, note) *not
by* <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p23.7"></span>προβολή</span>
or emanation (*Princ.* iv. 28, i. 2. 4), as though the Son’s generation
were something that took place once for all, instead of existing
continuously. The Father is in the Son, the Son in the Father: there is
‘coinherence.’ On the other hand, the Word is God *derivatively not
absolutely,* <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p23.8"></span>῾Ο
λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, καὶ Θεὸς ἦν ὁ Λόγος</span>. The Son is <span

Philo’s <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p24.5"></span>δευτερεύων
θεός</span>). As the Son of God, He is contrasted with all <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p24.6"></span>γενητά</span>; as
contrasted with the Ingenerate Father, He stands at the head of the
series of <span class="Greek"><span

139· καὶ τῇ ταύτότητι τοῦ βουλήματος</span>, *Cels.* viii. 12). The Son
takes His place even in the cosmic process from Unity to Unity through
Plurality, ‘God is in every respect One and Simple, but the Saviour by
reason of the Many becomes Many’ (on [John i.
22](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#022.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p25.10"></span>,
cf. Index to this vol., *s.v. Christ*). The Spirit is subordinated to
the Son, the Son to the Father (<span class="Greek"><span

232·ς</span>…<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p25.12"></span>ἔτι δὲ
ἧττον τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον</span>, *Princ.* I. 3, 5 Gk.), while to the
Spirit are subordinated *created* spirits, whose goodness is relative in
comparison with God, and the fall of some of whom led to the creation of
matter (see above). Unlike the Son and the Spirit they are mutable in
will, subject to <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p25.13"></span>προκοπή</span>, capable of embodiment even if
in themselves immaterial.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p26"></span>The above slender sketch of the leading
thoughts of Origen will suffice to show how intimately his doctrine of
the Person of Christ hangs together with his philosophy of Religion and
Nature. That philosophy is the philosophy of his age, and must be judged
relatively. His deeply religious, candid, piercing spirit embodies the
highest effort of the Christian intellect conditioned by the categories
of the best thought of his age. Everywhere, while evading no difficulty,
his strenuous speculative search is steadied by ethical and religious
instinct. As against Valentinian and the Platonists, with both of whom
he is in close affinity, he inexorably insists on the self-consciousness
and moral nature of God, on human freewill. As against all contemporary
non-Christian thought his system is pure monism. Yet the problem of
evil, in which he merges the antithesis of matter and spirit, brings
with it a necessary dualism, a dualism, however, which belongs but to a
moment in the limitless eternity of God’s all-in-allness before and
after. Is he then a pantheist? No, for to him God is Love (*in Ezek*.
vi. 6), and the rational creature is to be made divine and united to God
by the reconciliation of *Will* and by conscious apprehension of Him.
The idea of Will is the pivot of Origen’s system, the centripetal force
which forbids it to follow the pantheistic line which it yet undoubtedly
touches. The ‘moral’ unity of the Father and the Son (see above, <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p26.1"></span>ταὐτότης βουλήματος</span>
and <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p26.2"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p26.3"></span>κ τοῦ θελήματος</span>) is
Unity in that very respect in which the Creator stands over against the
self-determining rational creature. Yet the immutability, the Oneness of
God, must be reconciled with the plurality, the mutability of the
creature; here the Logos mediates; <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p26.4"></span>διὰ τὰ πολλὰ γίνεται πολλά</span>: but this
must be from eternity:—*accordingly creation is eternal too.* Here we
see that the cosmological idea has prevailed over the religious, the
Logos of Origen is still in important particulars the Logos of the
Apologists, of Philo and the philosophers. The difference lies in His
*co-eternity,* upon which Origen insists without wavering. The
resemblance lies in the intermediate <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) position ascribed to Him between the
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p27.10"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p27.11"></span>γέννητος</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p27.12"></span>, (</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p27.13"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p27.14"></span>Θεός</span>), and the
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p27.15"></span>γενητά</span>; He
is, as Hypostasis, subordinate to the Father.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p28"></span>Now it is evident that the mere
intellectual apprehension of a system which combines so many opposite
tendencies, which touches every variety of the theological thought of
the age (even modalism, for to Origen *the Father* is the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p28.1"></span>Μονάς</span>, the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p28.2"></span>αὐτόθεος</span>, while yet
He is no abstraction but a God who exists in moral activity, *supra*)
and subtly harmonises them all, must have involved no ordinary
philosophical power. When we add to this fact the further consideration
that precisely the fundamental ideas of Origen were those which called
forth the liveliest opposition and were gradually dropped by his
followers, we can easily understand that in the next generation
Origenism was no longer either the system of Origen, or a single system
at all.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p29"></span>In one direction it could lend itself to
no compromise; in spite of the justice done by Origen to the fundamental
ideas both of modalism and of emanative adoptionism (cf. Harnack, pp.
548, note, and 586), to Monarchianism in either form he is diametrically
opposed. The hypostatic distinctness of Son and Spirit is once for all
made good for the theology of Eastern Christendom. We see his disciples
exterminate Monarchianism in the East. On the left wing Dionysius
refutes the Sabellians of Libya, on the right Gregory Thaumaturgus,
Firmilian, and their brethren, after a long struggle, oust the
adoptionist Paul from the See of Antioch. But its influence on the
existing Catholic theology, however great (and in the East it was very
great), inevitably made its way in the face of opposition, and at the
cost of its original subtle consistency. The principal opposition came
from Asia Minor, where the traditions of theological thought (see above,
on Ignatius and Irenæus, below on Marcellus) were not in sympathy <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) with Origen. We cannot demonstrate the
existence of a continuous theological school in Asia; but <span
id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span> <span
id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxvii"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p30.2"></span>Methodius</span> (270–300) certainly speaks
with the voice of Ignatius and Irenæus. He deals with Origen much as
Irenæus dealt with the Gnostics, defending against him the current sense
of the *regula fidei,* and especially the literal meaning of Scripture,
the origination of the soul along with the body, the resurrection of the
body in the material sense, and generally opposing *realism* to the
spiritualism of Origen. But in thus opposing Origen, Methodius is not
uninfluenced by him (see Socr. vi. 13). He, too, is a student of Plato
(with ‘little of his style or spirit’); his ‘realism’ is ‘speculative.’
He no longer defends the Asiatic Chiliasm, his doctrine of the Logos is
coloured by Origen as that of Irenæus was by the Apologists. *The legacy
of Methodius and of his Origenist contemporaries to the Eastern Church
was a modified Origenism,* that is a theology systematised on the
intellectual basis of the Platonic philosophy, but expurgated by the
standard of the *regula fidei.* This result was a compromise, and was at
first attended with great confusion. Origen’s immediate following seized
some one side, some another of his system; some were more, some less
influenced by the ‘orthodox’ reaction against his teaching. We may
distinguish an Origenist ‘right’ and an Origenist ‘left.’ If the
Origenist view of the Universe was given up, the coeternity of the Son
and Spirit with the Father was less firmly grasped. Origen had, if we
may use the expression, ‘levelled up.’ The Son was mediator between the
Ingenerate God and the created, but eternal Universe. If the latter was
not eternal, and if at the same time the Word stood in some essential
correlation to the creative energy of God, Origen’s system no longer
implied the strict coeternity of the Word. Accordingly we find Dionysius
(see below, p. 173 sqq.) uncertain on this point, and on the essential
relation of the Son to the Father. More cautious in this respect, but
tenacious of other startling features of Origen, were Pierius and
Theognostus, who presided over the Catechetical School at the end of the
century <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) .

<span id="v.ii.iv-p32"></span>On the other hand, very many of Origen’s
pupils, especially among the bishops, started from the other side of
Origen’s teaching, and held tenaciously to the coeternity of the Son,
while they abandoned the Origenist ‘paradoxes’ with regard to the
Universe, matter, pre-existence, and restitution. Typical of this class
is Gregory Thaumaturgus, also Peter the martyr bishop of Alexandria, who
expressly opposed many of Origen’s positions (though hardly with the
violence ascribed to him in certain supposed fragments in Routh, *Rell.*
iv. 81) and Alexander himself. It was this ‘wing’ of the Origenist
following that, in combination with the opposition represented by
Methodius, bequeathed to the generation contemporary with Nicæa its
average theological tone. The coeternity of the Son with the Father was
not (as a rule) questioned, but the essential relation of the Logos to
the Creation involved a strong subordination of the Son to the Father,
and by consequence of the Spirit to the Son. Monarchianism was the
heresy most dreaded, the theology of the Church was based on the
philosophical categories of Plato applied to the explanation and
systematisation of the rule of faith. This was very far from Arianism.
It lacked the logical definiteness of that system on the one hand, it
rested on the other hand on a different conception of God; the
hypostatic subordination of the Son was insisted upon, but His true
Sonship as of one Nature with the Father, was held fast. In the slow
process of time this neo-Asiatic theology found its way partly to the
Nicene formula, partly to the illogical acceptance of it with regard to
the Son, with refusal to apply it to the Spirit (Macedonius). To the men
who thought thus, the blunt assertion that the Son was a creature, not
coeternal, alien to the Essence of the Father, was a novelty, and wholly
abhorrent. Arius drew a sharper line than they had been accustomed to
draw between God and the creature; so did Athanasius. But Arius drew his
line without flinching between the Father and the Son. This to the
instinct of any Origenist was as revolting as it would have been to the
clear mind and Biblical sympathy of Origen himself. In theological and
philosophical principles alike Arius was opposed even to the tempered
Origenism of the Nicene age. The latter was at the furthest remove from
Monarchianism, Arianism was *in its essential core* Monarchian; the
common theology borrowed its philosophical principles and method from
the Platonists, Arius from Aristotle. To anticipate, Arianism and
(so-called) semi-Arianism have in reality very little in common except
the historical fact of common action for a time. Arianism guarded the
transcendence of the divine nature (at the expense of revelation and
redemption) in a way that ‘semi-Arianism,’ admitting as it did inherent
inequality in the Godhead, did not. They therefore tended in opposite
directions; Arianism to Anomœanism, ‘semi-Arianism’ to the Nicene faith;
their source was different. ‘Aristotle made men Arians,’ says Newman
with truth, ‘Plato, semi-Arians’ (*Arians*4, p. 335, note): but to say
this is to allow that if Arianism goes back to Lucian and so to Paul of
Samosata, semi-Arianism is a fragment from the wreck of Origen.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p33"></span>The Origenist bishops of Syria and Asia
Minor had in the years 269–272, after several efforts, succeeded in
deposing <span class="c10"><span id="v.ii.iv-p33.1"></span>Paul</span>
of Samosata from the See of Antioch. This remarkable man was the ablest
pre-Nicene representative of Adoptionist Monarchianism. The Man Jesus
was inhabited by the ‘Word,’ i.e. by an *impersonal* power of God,
distinct from the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p33.2"></span>Λόγος</span> or reason (wisdom) inherent in
God as an attribute, which descended upon him at His Baptism. His union
with God, a union *of Will,* was unswerving, and by virtue of it He
overcame the sin of mankind, worked miracles, and entered on a condition
of Deification. He is God <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p33.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p33.4"></span>κ προκοπῆς</span> (cf. [Luke ii.
52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052)<span id="v.ii.iv-p33.5"></span>.md) by
virtue of progress in perfection. That is in brief the system of Paul,
and we cannot wonder at his deposition. For the striking points of
contact with Arianism (two ‘Wisdoms,’ two ‘Words,’ <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p33.6"></span>προκοπή</span>: cf. *Orat.
c. Ar.* i. 5, &c.) we have to account <span
id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) . The theology of Arius is a compromise
between the Origenist doctrine of the Person of Christ and the pure
Monarchian Adoptionism of Paul of Samosata; or rather it engrafts the
former upon the latter as the <span id="page_xxviii">p. xxviii</span>
<span id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxviii"></span>foundation principle, seriously
modifying each to suit the necessity of combining the two. This
compromise was not due to Arius himself but to his teacher, <span
class="c10"><span id="v.ii.iv-p34.2"></span>Lucian</span> the Martyr. A
native himself of Samosata, he stood in some relation of attachment (not
clearly defineable) to Paul. Under him, he was at the head of a
critical, exegetical, and theological school at Antioch. Upon the
deposition of Paul he appears not so much to have been formally
excommunicated as to have refused to acquiesce in the new order of
things. Under Domnus and his two successors, he was in a state of
suspended communion <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) ; but
eventually was reconciled with the bishop (Cyril?) and died as a martyr
at Nicomedia, Jan. 7, 312. The latter fact, his ascetic life, and his
learning secured him widespread honour in the Church; his pupils formed
a compact and enthusiastic brotherhood, and filled many of the most
influential Sees after the persecution. That such a man should be
involved in the reproach of having given birth to Arianism is an
unwelcome result of history, but one not to be evaded <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) . The history of the Lucianic compromise
and its result in the Lucianic type of theology, are both matters of
inference rather than of direct knowledge. As to the first, whatever
evidence there is connects Lucian’s original position with Paul. His
reconciliation with Bishop Cyril must have involved a reapproachment to
the formula of the bishops who deposed Paul,—a thoroughly Origenist
document. We may therefore suppose that the *identification* of Christ
with the Logos, or cosmic divine principle, was adopted by him from
Origenist sources. But he could not bring himself to admit that He was
thus essentially identified with God the eternal; he held fast to the
idea of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p36.1"></span>προκοπή</span> as the path by which the Lord
attained to Divinity; he distinguished the Word or Son who was Christ
from the immanent impersonal Reason or Wisdom of God, as an offspring of
the Father’s *Will,* an idea which he may have derived straight from
Origen, with whom of course it had a different sense. For to Origen Will
was the very essence of God; Lucian fell back upon an arid philosophical
Monotheism, upon an abstract God fenced about with negations (Harnack
22, 195, note) and remote from the Universe. It was counted a departure
from Lucian’s principles if a pupil held that the Son was the ‘perfect
Image of the Father’s Essence’ (Philost. ii. 15); Origen’s formula,
‘distinct in hypostasis, but one in will,’ was apparently exploited in a
Samosatene sense to express the relation of the Son to the Father. *The
only two points in fact in which Lucian appears to have modified the
system of Paul* were, *firstly* in hypostatising the Logos, which to
Paul was an impersonal divine power, *secondly* in abandoning Paul’s
purely human doctrine of the historical Christ. To Lucian, the Logos
assumed a body (or rather ‘Deus *sapientiam suam misit* in hunc mundum
*carne* vestitam, *ubi infra,* p. 6), but itself took the place of a
soul <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) ; hence all the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p37.2"></span>ταπειναὶ λέξεις</span> of
the Gospels applied to the Logos *as such,* and the inferiority and
essential difference of the Son from the Father rigidly followed.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p38"></span>The above account of Lucian is based on
that of Harnack, *Dogmg.* ii. 184, sqq. It is at once in harmony with
all our somewhat scanty data (Alexander, Epiphanius, Philostorgius, and
the fragment of his last confession of faith preserved by Rufin. in Eus.
*H. E.* ix. 9, Routh, *Rell.* iv. pp. 5–7, from which Harnack rightly
starts) and is the only one which accounts for the phenomena of the rise
of Arianism. We find a number of leading Churchmen in agreement with
Arius, but in no way dependent on him. They are Eusebius of Nicomedia,
Maris, Theognis, Athanasius of Anazarba, Menophantus; all Lucianists.
The first Arian writer, Asterius (see below), is a Lucianist. (The
Egyptian bishops Secundus and Theonas cannot be put down to any school;
we do not know their history; but they are distinguished from the
Lucianists by Philost. ii. 3.) It has been urged that, although Arius
brought away heresy from the school of Lucian, yet he was not the only
one that did so. True; but then the heresy was *all of the same kind*
(list of pupils of Lucian in Philost. ii. 14, iii. 15). Aetius, the
founder of logical ultra-Arianism and teacher of Eunomius, was taught
the exegesis of the New Testament by the Lucianists Athanasius of
Anazarba and Antony of Tarsus, of the Old by the Lucianist Leontius.
This fairly covers the area of Arianism proper. But it may be noted that
some Origenists of the ‘left wing,’ whose theology emphasized the
subordination, and vacillated as to the eternity of the Son, would find
little to shock them in Arianism (Eusebius of Cæsarea, Paulinus of
Tyre), while on the other hand there are traces of a Lucianist ‘right
wing,’ men like <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p38.1"></span>Asterius</span>, who while essentially Arian,
made concessions to the ‘conservative’ position chiefly by emphasising
the cosmic mediation of the Word and His ‘exact likeness’ to the
Father <span id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) . The Theology of the
Eastern Church was suffering from the effort to assimilate the Origenist
theology: it could not do so without eliminating the underlying and
unifying idea of Origenism; this done, the overwhelming influence of the
great teacher remained, while dissonant fragments of his system, vaguely
comprehended in many cases, permeated some here, some there <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) . Meanwhile the school of Lucian had a
method and a system; they knew their own minds, and relied on reason and
exegesis. This was the secret of their power. Had Arius never existed,
Arianism must have tried its strength under such conditions. But the age
was ready for Arius; and Arius was ready. The system of <span
class="c10"><span id="v.ii.iv-p40.2"></span>Arius</span> was in effect
that of Lucian: its formulation appears to have been as much the work of
Asterius as of Arius himself. (Cf. p. 155, §8, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p40.3"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p40.4"></span>δὲ ᾽Αρ. μεταγράψας δέδωκε τοῖς ἰδίοις</span>.
The extant writings of Arius are his letters to Eus. Nic. and to
Alexander, preserved by Theodoret and Epiph. *Hær.* 69, and the extracts
from the ‘Thalia’ in Ath., pp. 308–311, 457, 458; also the ‘confession’
in Socr. i. 26, Soz. ii. 27. Cf. also references to his dicta in Ath.
pp. 185, 229, &c.) Arius started from the *idea of God* and the
*predicate ‘Son.’* God is above all things uncreated, or unoriginate,
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p40.5"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p40.6"></span>γέν\[ν\]ητος</span>, (the
ambiguity of the derivatives of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p40.7"></span>γεννᾶσθαι</span> and <span id="page_xxix">p.
xxix</span> <span id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxix"></span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p40.8"></span>γενέσθαι</span> are a very
important element in the controversy. See p. 475, note 5, and Lightfoot,
*Ignat.* ii. p. 90 *sqq.*) Everything else is created, <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p40.9"></span>γενητόν</span>. The name
‘Son’ implies an *act* of procreation. Therefore, before such act, there
was no Son, nor was God properly speaking a Father. The Son is not
coeternal with Him. He was originated by the Father’s will, as indeed
were all things. He is, then, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p40.10"></span>τῶν γενητῶν</span>, He came into being from
non-existence (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p40.11"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p40.12"></span>ξ οὐκ ὄντων</span>), and before that did not
exist (<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p40.13"></span>οὐκ ἦν πρὶν
γένηται</span>). But His relation to God differs from that of the
Universe generally. Created nature cannot bear the awful touch of bare
Deity. God therefore created the Son that He in turn might be the agent
in the Creation of the Universe—‘created Him as the beginning of His
ways,’ ([Prov. viii. 22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p40.14"></span>, LXX.). This being so, the nature of the Son
was in the essential point of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p40.15"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p40.16"></span>γεννησία</span> unlike that of the Father;
(<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p40.17"></span>ξένος τοῦ υἱοῦ
κατ᾽ οὐσίαν ὁ Πατὴρ ὅτι ἄναρχος</span>): their substances (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p40.18"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p40.19"></span>ποστάσεις</span>) are
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p40.20"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p40.21"></span>νεπίμικτοι</span>,—have
nothing in common. The Son therefore does not possess the fundamental
property of sonship, identity of nature with the Father. He is a Son by
Adoption, not by Nature; He has advanced by moral probation to be Son,
even to be <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p40.22"></span>μονογενὴς θεός</span> ([Joh. i.
14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)<span id="v.ii.iv-p40.23"></span>.md).
He is not the eternal <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p40.24"></span>Λόγος</span>, reason, of God, but *a* Word
(and God has spoken many): but yet He is *the* Word by grace; is *no
longer,* what He is *by nature,* subject to change. He cannot know the
Father, much less make Him known to others. Lastly, He dwells in flesh,
not in full human nature (see above, p. xxviii. and note 2). The
doctrine of Arius as to the Holy Spirit is not recorded, but probably He
was placed between the Son and the other <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p40.25"></span>κτίσματα</span> (yet see Harnack ii. 199,
note 2).

<span id="v.ii.iv-p41"></span>*Arian Literature.* Beside the
above-mentioned letters and fragments of Arius, our early Arian
documents are scanty. Very important is the letter of Eus. Nic. to
Paulinus, referred to above, §3 (1), pp. xvi., xviii., other fragments
of letters, p. 458 sq. The writings <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md)
of <span class="c10"><span id="v.ii.iv-p42.42"></span>Asterius</span>,
if preserved, would have been an invaluable source of information <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) . Asterius seems to have written before
the Nicene Council; he may have modified his language in later
treatises. He was replied to by Marcellus in a work which brought him
into controversy (336) with Eusebius of Cæsarea. With the creeds and
Arian literature after the death of Constantine we are not at present
concerned.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p44"></span>Arianism was a novelty. Yet it combines in
an inconsistent whole elements of almost every previous attempt to
formulate the doctrine of the Person of Christ. Its sharpest antithesis
was Modalism: yet with the modalist Arius maintained the strict personal
unity of the Godhead. With dynamic monarchianism it held the adoptionist
principle in addition; but it personified the Word and sacrificed the
entire humanity of Christ. In this latter respect it sided with the
Docetæ, most Gnostics, and Manichæans, to all of whom it yet opposes a
sharply-cut doctrine of creation and of the transcendence of God. With
Origen and the Apologists before him it made much of the cosmic
mediation of the Word in contrast to the redemptive work of Jesus; with
the Apologists, though not with Origen, it enthroned in the highest
place the God of the Philosophers: but against both alike it drew a
sharp broad line between the Creator and the Universe, and drew it
between the Father and the Son. Least of all is Arianism in sympathy
with the theology of Asia,—that of Ignatius, Irenæus, Methodius, founded
upon the Joannine tradition. The profound Ignatian idea of Christ as the
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p44.1"></span>Λόγος ἀπὸ σιγῆς
προελθών</span> is in impressive contrast with the shallow challenge of
the *Thalia,* ‘Many words hath God spoken, which of these was manifested
in the flesh?’

<span id="v.ii.iv-p45"></span>Throughout the controversies of the
pre-Nicene age the question felt rather than seen in the background is
that of the <span class="c10"><span id="v.ii.iv-p45.1"></span>Idea of
God</span>. The question of Monotheism and Polytheism which separated
Christians from heathen was not so much a question of abstract theology
as of religion, not one of speculative belief, but of worship. The
Gentile was prepared to recognise in the background of his pantheon the
shadowy form of one supreme God, Father of gods and men, from whom all
the rest derived their being. But his religion required the pantheon as
well; he could not worship a philosophic supreme abstraction. The
Christian on the other hand was prepared in many cases to recognise the
existence of beings corresponding to the gods of the heathen (whether [1
Cor. viii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p45.2"></span> can be quoted here is open to question). But
such beings he would not worship. To him, as an object of religion,
there was one God. The one God of the heathen was no object of practical
personal religion; the One God of the Christian was. He was the God of
the Old Testament, the God who was known to His people not under
philosophical categories, but in His dealings with them as a Father,
Deliverer, He who would accomplish all things for them that waited on
Him, the God of the Covenant. He was the God of the New Testament, God
in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, manifesting His
Righteousness in the Gospel of Christ to whosoever believed. In Christ
the Christian learned that God is Love. Now this knowledge of God is
essentially religious; it lies in a different plane from the speculative
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p45.3"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p45.4"></span>πορίαι</span> as to God’s
transcendence or immanence, while yet it steadies the religious mind in
the face of speculations tending either way. A God who is Love, if
immanent, must yet be personal, if transcendent, must yet manifest His
Love in such a way that we can know it and not merely guess it. Now as
Christian instinct began to be forced to reflexion, in other words, as
faith began to strive for expression in a theology <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) , it could not but be that men, however
personally religious, seized hold of religious problems by their
speculative side. We have seen this exemplified in the influence of
Platonic philosophy on the Apologists and Alexandrine Fathers. But to
Origen, with all his Platonism, belongs the honour of enthroning the God
of Love at the head and centre of a systematic theology. Yet the
theology of the end of the third century assimilated secondary results
of Origen’s system rather than his underlying idea. On the one hand was
the rule of faith with the whole round of Christian life and worship,
determining the religious instinct of the Church; on the other, the
inability to formulate this instinct in a coherent system so long as the
central problem was overlooked or inadequately dealt with. God is One,
not more; yet how is the One God to be conceived of, <span
id="page_xxx">p. xxx</span> <span id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxx"></span>what is
His relation to the Universe of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p46.2"></span>γένεσις</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p46.3"></span>φθόρα</span>? and the Son is God, and the
Spirit; how are they One, and if One how distinct? How do we avoid the
relapse into a polytheism of secondary gods? What is—not the essential
nature of Godhead, for all agreed that that is beyond our ken—but the
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p46.4"></span>πρῶτον ἡμῖν</span>,
the essential idea for *us* to begin from if we are to synthesise belief
and theology, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p46.5"></span>πίστις</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p46.6"></span>γνῶσις</span>?

<span id="v.ii.iv-p47"></span>Arianism stepped in with a summary answer.
God is one, numerically and absolutely. He is beyond the ken of any
created intelligence. Even creation is too close a relation for Him to
enter into with the world. In order to create, he must create an
instrument (pp. 360 sqq.), intermediate between Himself and all else.
This instrument is called Son of God, i.e. He is not coeternal (for what
son was ever as old as his parent?), but the result of an act of
creative will. How then is He different from other creatures? This is
the weak point of the system; He is not really different, but a
difference is created by investing Him with every possible attribute of
glory and divinity except the possession of the incommunicable nature of
deity. He is merely ‘anointed above His fellows.’ His ‘divinity’ is
acquired, not original; relative, not absolute; in His character, not in
His Person. Accordingly He is, as a creature, immeasurably far from the
Creator; He does not know God, cannot declare God to us. The One God
remains in His inaccessible remoteness from the creature. But yet Arians
worshipped Christ; although not very God, He is God to us. Here we have
the exact difficulty with which the Church started in her conflict with
heathenism presented again unsolved. The desperate struggle, the hardly
earned triumph of the Christians, had been for the sake of the essential
principle of heathenism! The One God was, after all, the God of the
philosophers; the idea of pagan polytheism was realised and justified in
Christ <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) ! To this Athanasius returns
again and again (see esp. p. 360); it is the doom of Arianism as a
Christian theology.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p49"></span>If Arianism failed to assist the thought
of the Church to a solution of the great problem of God, its failure was
not less conspicuous with regard to revelation and redemption. The
revelation of the Gospel stopped short in the person of Christ, did not
go back to the Father. God was *not* in Christ reconciling the world to
Himself, we have access in Christ to a created intelligence, not to the
love of God to usward, not to the everlasting Arms, but to a being
neither divine nor human. Sinners against heaven and before God, we must
accept an assurance of reconciliation from one who does not know Him
whom we have offended; the kiss of the Father has never been given to
the prodigal. Men have asked how we are justified in ascribing to the
infinite God the attributes which we men call good: mercy, justice,
love. If Christ is God, the answer lies near; if He is the Christ of
Arius, we are left in moral agnosticism. Apart from Christ, the
philosophical arguments for a God have their force; they proffer to us
an ennobling belief, a grand ‘perhaps’; but the historical inability of
Monotheism to retain a lasting hold among men apart from revelation is
an impressive commentary on their compelling power. In Christ alone does
God lay hold upon the soul with the assurance of His love ([Rom.
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005.md), [Matt.
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md), [John
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003)<span id="v.ii.iv-p49.1"></span>.md).
The God of Arius has held out no hand toward us; he is a far-off
abstraction, not a living nor a redeeming God.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p50"></span>The illogicality of Arianism has often
been pointed out (Gwatkin, pp. 21 *sqq.* esp. p. 28); how, starting from
the Sonship of Christ, it came round to a denial of His Sonship; how it
started with an interest for Monotheism and landed in a vindication of
polytheism; how it began from the incomprehensibility of God even to His
Son, and ended (in its most pronounced form) with the assertion that the
divine Nature is no mystery at all, even to us. It is an insult to the
memory of Aristotle to call such shallow hasty syllogising from
ill-selected and unsifted first principles by his name. Aristotle
himself teaches a higher logic than this. But at this date
Aristotelianism proper was extinct. It only survived in the form of
‘pure’ logic, adopted by the Platonists, but also studied for its own
sake in connection with rhetoric and the art of arguing (cf. Socr. ii.
35). Such an instrument might well be a cause of confusion in the hands
of men who used it without regard to the conditions of the
subject-matter. An illogical compromise between the theology of Paul of
Samosata and of Origen, the marvel is that Arianism satisfied any one
even in the age of its birth. What has been said above with regard to
the conception of God in the early Church may help to explain it; the
germ of ethical insight which is latent in adoptionism, and which when
neglected by the Church has always made itself felt by reaction, must
also receive justice; once again, its inherent intellectualism was in
harmony with the dominant theology of the Eastern Church, that is with
one side of Origenism. Where analogous conditions have prevailed, as for
example in the England of the early eighteenth century, Arianism has
tended to reappear with no one of its attendant incongruities missing.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p51"></span>But for all that, the doom of Arianism was
uttered at Nicæa and verified in the six decades which followed. Every
possible alternative formula of belief as to the Person of Christ was
forced upon the mind of the early Church, was fully tried, and was found
wanting. Arianism above all was fully tried and above all found lacking.
The Nicene formula alone has been found to render possible the life, to
satisfy the instincts of the Church of Christ. The choice lies—nothing
is clearer—between that and the doctrine of Paul of Samosata. The
latter, it has been said, was misunderstood, was never fairly tried. As
a claimant to represent the true sense of Christianity it was I think
once for all rejected when the first Apostles gave the right hand of
fellowship to S. Paul (see above, p. xxii.); its future trial must be in
the form of naturalism, as a rival to Christianity, on the basis of a
denial of the claim of Christ to be the One Saviour of the World, and of
His Gospel to be the Absolute Religion. But Arianism, adding to all the
difficulties of a supernatural Christology the spirit of the shallowest
rationalism and the fundamental postulate of agnosticism, can surely
count for nothing in the Armageddon of the latter days,

<span id="v.ii.iv-p52"></span>Spiacente a Dio ed a’ nemici suoi.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p53"></span>(b) The <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p53.1"></span>ὁμοούσιον</span> as a theological
formula <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) .

<span id="v.ii.iv-p55"></span>The distinction, which in the foregoing
discussion we have frequently had under our notice, between the <span
id="page_xxxi">p. xxxi</span> <span id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxxi"></span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p55.1"></span>πίστις</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p55.2"></span>γνῶσις</span> of the early
Church, the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p55.3"></span>πίστις</span> common to all, and formulated in
the *tessera* or rule of faith, the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p55.4"></span>γνῶσις</span> the property of apologists and
theologians aiming at the expression of faith in terms of the thought of
their age, and at times, though for long only slightly, reacting upon
the rule of faith itself (Aquileia, Cæsarea, Gregory Thaumaturgus),
makes itself felt in the account of the Nicene Council. That the legacy
of the first world-wide gathering of the Church’s rulers is a Rule of
Faith moulded by theological reflexion, one in which the γνῶσις of the
Church supplements her <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p55.5"></span>πίστις</span>, is a momentous fact; a fact for
which we have to thank not Athanasius but Arius. The <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p55.6"></span>πίστις</span> of the
Fathers repudiated Arianism as a novelty; but to exclude it from the
Church some test was indispensable; and to find a test was the task of
theology, of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p55.7"></span>γνῶσις</span>. The Nicene Confession is the
Rule of Faith explained as against Arianism. Arianism started with the
Christian profession of belief in our Lord’s *Sonship*. If the result
was incompatible with such belief, it was inevitable that an explanation
should be given, not indeed of the full meaning of divine Sonship, but
of that element in the idea which was ignored or assailed by the
misconception of Arius. Such an explanation is attempted in the words
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p55.8"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p55.9"></span>κ τῆς οὐσίας τοῦ πατρός,
ὁμοούσιαν τῷ Πατρί</span>, and again in the condemnation of the formula
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p55.10"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p55.11"></span>ξ ἑτέρας ὑποστάσεως ἢ
οὐσίας</span>. This explanation was not adopted without hesitation, nor
would it have been adopted had any other barrier against the heresy,
which all but very few wished to exclude, appeared effective. We now
have to examine firstly the grounds of this hesitation, secondly the
justification of the formula itself.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p56"></span>The objections felt to the word ὁμοούσιον
at the council were (1) philosophical, based on the identification of
οὐσία with either <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p56.1"></span>εἶδος</span> (i.e. as implying a ‘formal
essence’ prior to Father and Son alike) or <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p56.2"></span>ὕ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p56.3"></span>λη</span>; (2) dogmatic, based on the
identification of οὐσία with τόδε τι, and on the consequent Sabellian
sense of the ὁμοούσιον; (3) Scriptural, based on the non-occurrence of
the word in the Bible; (4) Ecclesiastical, based on the condemnation of
the word by the Synod which deposed Paul at Antioch in 269.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p57"></span>All these objections were made and felt
*bona fide*, although Arians would of course make the most of them. The
subsequent history will show that their force was outweighed only for
the moment with many of the fathers, and that to reconcile the
‘conservatism’ of the Asiatic bishops to the new formula must be a
matter of time. The third or Scriptural objection need not now be
discussed at length. Precedent could be pleaded for the introduction
into creeds of words not expressly found in Scripture (e.g. the word
‘catholic’ applied to the Church in many ancient creeds, the creed of
Gregory Thaumaturgus with τρίας τελεία, &c. &c.); the only question was,
were the non-scriptural words expressive of a *Scriptural idea?* This
was the pith of the question debated between Athanasius and his
opponents for a generation after the council; the ‘conservative’
majority eventually came round to the conviction that Athanasius was
right. But the question depends upon the meaning of the word itself.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p58"></span>The word means *sharing in a joint or
common* essence, οὐσία (cf. <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p58.1"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p58.2"></span>μώνυμος</span>, sharing the same name, &c.
&c.). What then is οὐσία? The word was introduced into philosophical
use, so far as we know, by Plato, and its technical value was fixed for
future ages by his pupil Aristotle. Setting aside its use to express
‘existence’ in the abstract, we take the more general use of the word as
indicating that which exists in the concrete. In this sense it takes its
place at the centre of his system of ‘categories,’ as the something to
which all determinations of quality, quantity, relation and the rest
attach, and which itself attaches to nothing; in Aristotle’s words it
alone is self-existent, χωριστόν, whereas all that comes under any of
the other categories is ἀχώριστον, non-existent except as a property of
some οὐσία. But here the difficulty begins. We may look at a concrete
term as denoting either this or that individual simply (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p58.3"></span>τόδε τι</span>), or as
expressing its nature, and so as common to more individuals than one.
Now properly (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p58.4"></span>πρώτως</span>) οὐσία is only appropriate to
the former purpose. But it may be employed in a secondary sense to
designate the latter; in this sense species and genera are δεύτεραι
οὐσίαι, the wider class being less truly οὐσίαι than the narrower. In
fact we here detect the transition of the idea of οὐσία from the
category of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p58.5"></span>οὐσία</span> proper to that of <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p58.6"></span>ποιόν</span> (cf. Athan.
p. 478 *sq.*; he uses <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p58.7"></span>οὐσία</span> freely in the secondary sense for
non-theological purposes in *contra Gentes,* where it is often best
rendered ‘nature’). Aristotle accordingly uses <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p58.8"></span>οὐσία</span> freely to designate what we call
substances, whether simple or compound, such as iron, gold, earth, the
heavens, <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p58.9"></span>τὸ
ἀκίνητον</span>, &c., &c. Corresponding again, to the logical
distinction of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p58.10"></span>γένος</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p58.11"></span>εἶδος</span> is the metaphysical distinction
(not exactly of matter and form, but) of matter simply, regarded as
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p58.12"></span>τὸ
ὑποκειμένον</span>, and matter regarded as existing in this or that
form, <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p58.13"></span>τὸ ποιὸν τὸ
ἐν τῇ οὐσί& 139·, τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι,</span> the meeting-point of logic and
metaphysics in Aristotle’s system. Agreeably to this distinction, <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p58.14"></span>οὐσία</span> is used
sometimes of the latter—the concrete thing regarded in its essential
nature, sometimes of the former <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p58.15"></span>ἡ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p58.16"></span>ὑποκειμένη οὐσία ὡς ὕλη, ὕλη</span> being in
fact the *summum genus* of the material world.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p59"></span>Now the use of the word in Christian
theology had exemplified nearly every one of the above senses. In the
quasi-material sense <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p59.1"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p59.2"></span>μοούσιον</span> had been used in the school of
Valentinian to express the homogeneity of the two factors in the
fundamental dualism of the Universe of intelligent beings. In a somewhat
similar sense it is used in the Clementine Homilies xx. 7. The Platonic
phrase for the Divine Nature, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p59.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p59.4"></span>πέκεινα πάσης οὐσίας</span>, adopted by Origen
and by Athanasius *contra Gentes*, appears to retain something of the
idea of <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p59.5"></span>οὐσία</span>
as implying *material* existence; and this train of associations had to
be expressly disclaimed in defending the Nicene formula. In the sense of
homogeneity the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p59.6"></span>ὀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p59.7"></span>μοούσιον</span> is expressly applied by
Origen, as we have seen, to the Father and the Son: on the other hand,
taking <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p59.8"></span>οὐσία</span>
in the ‘primary’ Aristotelian sense, he has <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p59.9"></span>ἕ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p59.10"></span>τερος κατ᾽ οὐσίαν καὶ ὑποκειμένον</span> In
the West (see above on Tertullian and Novatian) the Latin *substantia*
(Cicero had in vain attempted to give currency to the less euphonious
but more suitable *essentia*) had taken its place in the phrase *unius
substantiæ* or*communio substantiæ,* intended to denote not only the
homogeneity but the Unity of Father and Son. Accordingly we find
Dionysius of Rome pressing the test upon his namesake of Alexandria and
the latter not declining it (below, p. 183). But a few years later we
find the Origenist bishops, who with the concurrence of Dionysius of
Rome deposed Paul of Samosata, expressly repudiating the term. This
fact, which is as certain as any fact in Church history (see Routh
*Rell.* iii. 364 &c., Caspari *Alte u. Neue. Q.,* pp. 161 *sqq.*), was a
powerful support to the Arians in their subsequent endeavours to unite
the conservative East in reaction against the council. Scholars are
fairly equally divided as to the explanation of the fact. Some hold,
following Athanasius <span id="page_xxxii">p. xxxii</span> <span
id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxxii"></span>and Basil, that Paul imputed the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p59.11"></span>ὀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p59.12"></span>μοούσιον</span> (in a
materialising sense) to his opponents, as a consequence of the doctrine
they opposed to his own, and that ‘the 80’ in repudiating the word,
repudiated the idea that the divine nature could be divided by the
emanation of a portion of it in the Logos. Hilary, on the other hand,
tells us that the word was used by Paul himself (‘male <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p59.13"></span>ὀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p59.14"></span>μοούσιον</span> Paulus
confessus est, sed numquid melius Arii negaverunt?’) If so, it must have
been meant to deny the existence of the Logos as an <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p59.15"></span>οὐσία</span> (i.e.
Hypostasis) distinct from the Father. Unfortunately we have not the
original documents to refer to. But in either case the word was
repudiated at Antioch in one sense, enacted at Nicæa in another. The
fact however remains that the term does not exclude ambiguity.
Athanasius is therefore going beyond strict accuracy when he claims (p.
164) that no one who is not an Arian can fail to be in agreement with
the Synod. Marcellus and Photinus alone prove the contrary. But he is
right in regarding the word as rigidly excluding the heresy of Arius.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p60"></span>This brings us to the question in what
sense <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.1"></span>οὐσία</span>
is used in the Nicene definition. We must remember the strong Western
and anti-Origenist influence which prevailed in the council (above, p.
xvii.), and the use of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.2"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.3"></span>πόστασις</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.4"></span>οὐσία</span> as convertible terms in the
anathematism (see Excursus A, pp. 77, *sqq.* below). Now going back for
a moment to the correspondence of the two Dionysii, we see that
Dionysius of Rome had contended not so much against the *subordination*
of the Son to the Father as against their undue *separation* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.5"></span>μεμερισμέναι
ὑποστάσεις</span>). In other words he had pressed the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.6"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.7"></span>μοούσιον</span> upon his
namesake in the interest rather of the *unity* than of the *equality* of
the Persons in the Holy Trinity. At Nicæa, the problem was (as shewn
above) to explain (at least negatively) how the Church understood the
Generation of the Son. Accordingly we find Athanasius in later years
explaining that the Council meant to place beyond doubt the *Essential
Relation* of the Divine Persons to one another (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.8"></span>τὸ ἴδιον τῆς οὐσίας,
ταὐτότης</span>, see *de Decr.* pp. 161, 163 *sq.*, 165, 168, 319; of
course including identity of Nature, pp. 396, 413, 232), and maintaining
to the end (where he expresses his own view, p. 490, &c.) the
convertibility of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.9"></span>οὐσία</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.10"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.11"></span>πόστασις</span> for this purpose. By the word
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.12"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.13"></span>θεός</span> or <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.14"></span>θεός</span> he
understands <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.15"></span>οὐδὲν
ἕτερον ἢ τὴν οὐσίαν τοῦ ὄντος</span> (*de Decr.* 22). The conclusion is
that in their original sense the definitions of Nicæa assert not merely
the *specific* identity of the Son with the Father (as Peter *qua* man
is of one <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.16"></span>οὐσία</span> with Paul, or the Emperor’s
statue of one form with the Emperor himself, p. 396), but the full
unbroken continuation of the Being of the Father in the Son, the
inseparable unity of the Son with the Father in the Oneness of the
Godhead. Here the phrase is ‘balanced’ by the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.17"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.18"></span>κ τῆς</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.19"></span>\[</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.20"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.21"></span>ποστάσεως ἢ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.22"></span>\]</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.23"></span>οὐσίας τοῦ Πατρὸς</span>, not as though
merely one <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.24"></span>οὐσία</span> had given existence to another,
but in the sense that with such origination the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.25"></span>οὐσία</span> remained the
same. This is a ‘first approximation to the mysterious doctrine of the
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.26"></span>περιχώρησις</span>’
coinherence, or ‘circuminsessio,’ which is necessary to guard the
doctrine of the Trinity against tritheism, but which, it must be
observed, lifts it out of the reach of the categories of any system of
thought in which the workings of human intelligence have ever been able
to organise themselves. The doctrine of the Holy Trinity vindicated by
the Nicene formula on the one hand remains, after the exclusion of
others, as the one direction in which the Christian intellect can travel
without frustrating and limiting the movement of faith, without bringing
to a halt the instinct of faith in Christ as Saviour, implanted in the
Church by the teaching of S. Paul and of S. John, of the Lord Himself:
on the other hand it is not a full solution of the intellectual
difficulties with which the analysis of that faith and those instincts
brings us face to face. That God is One, and that the Son is God, are
truths of revelation which the category of ‘substance’ fails to
synthesise. The Nicene Definition furnishes a basis of agreement for the
purpose of Christian devotion, worship, and life, but leaves two
theologies face to face, with mutual recognition as the condition of the
healthy life of either. The theology of Athanasius and of the West is
that of the Nicene formula in its original sense. The inseparable Unity
of the God of Revelation is its pivot. The conception of *personality*
in the Godhead is its difficulty. The distinctness of the Father, Son,
and Spirit is felt (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.27"></span>ἄ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.28"></span>λλος ὁ Πατήρ ἄλλος ὁ υἱ& 231·ς</span>), but
cannot be formulated so as to satisfy our full idea of personality. *For
this Athanasius had no word;* <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.29"></span>πρόσωπον</span> meant too little (implying as
it did no more than an aspect possibly worn but for a special period or
purpose), <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.30"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.31"></span>πόστασις</span> (implying such personality as
separates Peter from Paul) too much. But he recognised the admissibility
of the sense in which the Nicene formula eventually, in the theology of
the Cappadocian fathers, won its way to supremacy in the East. To them
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.32"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.33"></span>πόστασις</span> was an
appropriate term to express the distinction of Persons in the Godhead,
while <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.34"></span>οὐσία</span>
expressed the divine *Nature* which they possessed in common (see
Excursus A. p. 77 *sqq.*). This sense of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.35"></span>οὐσία</span> *approximated* to that of
species, or <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.36"></span>εἶδος</span> (Aristotle’s ‘secondary’ <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.37"></span>οὐσία</span>), while that
of <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.38"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.39"></span>πόστασις</span>
gravitated toward that of personality in the empirical sense. But in
neither case did the approximation amount to complete identity. The idea
of trine personality was limited by the consideration of the Unity; the
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.40"></span>περιχώρησις</span>
was recognised, although in a somewhat different form, the prominent
idea in Athanasius being that of *coinherence* or immanence, whereas the
Cappadocians, while using, of course, the language of <span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.41"></span>John xiv. <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.42"></span>11</span>, yet prefer the metaphor of
*successive dependence* <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.43"></span>ὥ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.44"></span>σπερ ἐξ ἁλύσεω</span>. (Bas. *Ep.* 38, p.
<span class="c10"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.45"></span>11</span>8 D). To
Athanasius, the Godhead is complete not in the Father alone, still less
in the Three Persons *as parts* of the one <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p60.46"></span>οὐσία</span>, but in *each* Person as much as
in *all*. The Cappadocian Fathers go back to the Origenist view that the
Godhead is complete primarily in the Father alone, but *mediately* in
the Son or Spirit, by virtue of their origination from the Father as
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.47"></span>πηγή</span> or
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p60.48"></span>αἰτία τῆς
θεότητος</span>. To Athanasius the *distinct Personality* of Son and
Spirit was the difficulty; his difference from Origen was wide, from
Marcellus subtle. To the Cappadocians the difficulty was the *Unity* of
the Persons; to Marcellus they were *toto cælo* opposed, they are the
pupils of Origen <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) . Accordingly when
Basil makes a distinction between <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p61.4"></span>οὐσία</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p61.5"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p61.6"></span>πόστασις</span> in the Nicene anathematism, he
is giving not historical exegesis but his own opinion.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p62"></span>The Nicene definition in this sense
emphasized the <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p62.1"></span>Unity</span> of the Godhead in Three Persons,
against the Arian *division* of the Son from the Father. How then did it
escape the danger of lending countenance to Monarchianism? Athanasius
feels the difficulty without solving it, for the distinction given by
him, p. 84, between <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p62.2"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p62.3"></span>μοούσιος</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p62.4"></span>μονοούσιος</span> is without real meaning
(*we* say with Tertullian ‘of *one* substance’). On the whole in mature
years he held that the title ‘Son’ was sufficient to secure the Trinity
of Persons. ‘By the name Father we confute Arius, by the name of Son we
overthrow Sabellius’ (p. 434; cf. p. 413); and we find that the council
in its revision of the Cæsarean creed shifted <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p62.5"></span>υἱ& 231·ς</span> to the principal position
where it took the place of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p62.6"></span>λόγος</span>. Beyond this the Creed imposed no
additional test in that direction (the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p62.7"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p62.8"></span>κ τῆς οὐσίας</span> is important but not <span
id="page_xxxiii">p. xxxiii</span> <span
id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxxiii"></span>decisive in this respect). This was felt
as an objection to the Creed, and the objection was pointed by the
influence of Marcellus at the council. The historical position of
Marcellus is in fact, as we shall see, the principal key to the
‘conservative’ reaction which followed. The insertion into the
conservative creeds of a clause asserting the endlessness of Christ’s
Kingdom, which eventually received ecumenical authority, was an
expression of this feeling. But a final explanation between the Nicene
doctrine and Monarchianism could not come about until the idea of
Personality had been tested in the light of the appearance of the Son in
the Flesh. The solution, or rather definition, of the problem is to be
sought in the history of the Christological questions which began with
Apollinarius of Laodicea.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p63"></span>The above account of the anti-Arian test
formulated at Nicæa will suffice to explain the motives for its
adoption, the difficulties which made that adoption reluctant, and the
fact of the reaction which followed. One thing is clear, namely that
given the actual conditions, nothing short of the test adopted would
have availed to exclude the Arian doctrine. It is also I think clear,
that not only was the current theology of the Eastern Church unable to
cope with Arianism, but that it was itself a danger to the Church and in
need of the corrective check of the Nicene definition. Hellenic as was
the system of Origen, it was in its spirit Christian, and saturated with
the influence of Scripture. It could never have taken its place as the
expression of the whole mind of the Church; but it remains as the
noblest monument of a Christian intellect resolutely in love with truth
for its own sake, and bent upon claiming for Christ the whole range of
the legitimate activity of the human spirit. But the age had inherited
only the wreck of Origenism, and its partial victory in the Church had
brought confusion in its train, the leaders of the Church were
characterised by secular knowledge rather than grasp of first
principles, by dogmatic intellectualism rather than central apprehension
of God in Christ. Eusebius of Cæsarea is their typical representative.
The Nicene definition and the work of Athanasius which followed were a
summons back to the simple first principles of the Gospel and the Rule
of Faith. What then is their value to ourselves? Above all, this, that
they have preserved to us what Arianism would have destroyed, that
assurance of Knowledge of, and Reconciliation to, God in Christ of which
the divinity of the Saviour is the indispensable condition; if we are
now Christians in the sense of S. Paul we owe it under God to the work
of the great synod. Not that the synod explained all; or did more than
effectually ‘block off false forms of thought or avenues of unbalanced
inference’ which ‘challenged the acceptance of Christian people.’ The
decisions of councils are ‘primarily not the Church saying “yes” to
fresh truths or developments or forms of consciousness; but rather
saying “no” to untrue and misleading modes of shaping and stating her
truth,’ (*Lux Mundi*, ed. i. p. 240, cf. p. 334). It is objected that
the Nicene Formula, especially as understood by Athanasius, is itself a
‘false form of thought,’ a flat contradiction in terms. That the latter
is true we do not dispute (see Newman’s notes *infra*, p. 336, note 1,
&c.). But before pronouncing the form of thought for that reason a false
one, we must consider what the ‘terms’ are, and to what they are
applied. To myself it appears that a religion which brought the divine
existence into the compass of the categories of any philosophy would by
that very fact forfeit its claim to the character of revelation. The
categories of human thought are the outcome of organised experience of a
sensible world, and beyond the limits of that world they fail us. This
is true quite apart from revelation. The ideas of essence and substance,
personality and will, separateness and continuity, cause and effect,
unity and plurality, are all in different degrees helps which the mind
uses in order to arrange its knowledge, and valid within the range of
experience, but which become a danger when invested with absolute
validity as things in themselves. Even the mathematician reaches real
results by operating with terms which contain a perfect contradiction
(e.g. ·, and to some extent the ‘calculus of operations’). The idea of
Will in man, of Personality in God, present difficulties which reason
cannot reconcile.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p64"></span>The revelation of Christ is addressed
primarily to the will not to the intellect, its appeal is to Faith not
to Theology. Theology is the endeavour of the Christian intellect to
frame for itself conceptions of matters belonging to the immediate
consequences of our faith, matters about which we must believe
something, but as to which the Lord and His Apostles have delivered
nothing formally explicit. Theology has no doubt its certainties beyond
the express teaching of our Lord and the New Testament writers; but its
work is subject to more than the usual limitations of human thought: we
deal with things outside the range of experience, with celestial things;
but ‘we have no celestial language.’ To abandon all theology would be to
acquiesce in a dumb faith: we are to teach, to explain, to defend; the
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p64.1"></span>λόγος σοφίας</span>
and <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p64.2"></span>λόγος
γνώσεως</span> have from the first been gifts of the Spirit for the
building up of the Body. But we know in part and prophesy in part, and
our terms begin to fail us just in the region where the problem of
guarding the faith of the simple ends and the inevitable metaphysic,
into which all pure reflexion merges, begins. <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p64.3"></span>Εἴτε οὖν φιλοσοφητέον εἴτε μὴ φιλοσοφητέον,
φιλοσοφητέον</span>, ‘man is metaphysical *nolens volens:*’ only let us
recollect that when we find ourselves in the region of antinomies we are
crossing the frontier line between revelation and speculation, between
the domain of theology and that of ontology. That this line is
approached in the definition of the great council no one will deny. But
it was reached by the council and by the subsequent consent of the
Church reluctantly and under compulsion. The bold assumption that we can
argue from the revelation of God in Christ to mysteries beyond our
experience was made by the Gnostics, by Arius: the Church met them by a
denial of what struck at the root of her belief, not by the claim to
erect formulæ applied merely for the lack of better into a revealed
ontology. In the terms Person, Hypostasis, Will, Essence, Nature,
Generation, Procession, we have the embodiment of ideas extracted from
experience, and, as applied to God, representing merely the best attempt
we can make to explain what we mean when we speak of God as Father and
of Christ as His Son. Even these last sacred names convey their full
meaning to us only in view of the historical person of Christ and of our
relation to God through Him. That this meaning is based upon an absolute
relation of Christ to the Father is the rock of our faith. That relation
is mirrored in the name Son of God: but what it is in itself, when the
empirical connotations of Sonship are stripped away, we cannot possibly
know. ‘<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p64.4"></span>Ομοούσιος τῷ
Πατρί, ἐκ τῆς οὐσίας τοῦ Πατρός</span>’ these words assert at once our
faith that such relation exists and our ignorance of its nature. To the
simplicity of faith it is enough to know (and this knowledge is what our
formula secures) that in Christ we have not only the perfect Example of
Human Love to God, but the direct expression and assurance of the
Father’s Love to us.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p65"></span>(c) Materials for Reaction.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p66"></span>‘The victory of Nicæa was rather a
surprise than a solid conquest. As it was not the <span
id="page_xxxiv">p. xxxiv</span> <span
id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxxiv"></span>spontaneous and deliberate purpose of the
bishops present, but a revolution which a minority had forced through by
sheer strength of clearer Christian thought, a reaction was inevitable
as soon as the half-convinced conservatives returned home’ (Gwatkin).
The reaction, however, was not for a long time overtly doctrinal. The
defeat, the moral humiliation of Arianism at the council was too signal,
the prestige of the council itself too overpowering, the Emperor too
resolute in supporting its definition, to permit of this. Not till after
the death of Constantine in 337 does the policy become manifest of
raising alternative symbols to a coordinate rank with that of Nicæa; not
till six years after the establishment of Constantius as sole
Emperor,—i.e. not till 357,—did Arianism once again set its mouth to the
trumpet. During the reign of Constantine the reaction, though doctrinal
in its motive, was personal in its ostensible grounds. The leaders of
the victorious minority at Nicæa are one by one attacked on this or that
pretence and removed from their Sees, till at the time of Constantine’s
death the East is in the hands of their opponents. What were the forces
at work which made this possible?

<span id="v.ii.iv-p67"></span>(1) *Persecuted Arians*. Foremost of all,
the harsh measures adopted by Constantine with at least the tacit
approval of the Nicene leaders furnished material for reaction. Arius
and his principal friends were sent into exile, and as we have seen they
went in bitterness of spirit. Arius himself was banished to Illyricum,
and would seem to have remained there five or six years. (The chronology
of his recall is obscure, but see D.C.B. ii. 364, and Gwatkin, p. 86,
note 2). It would be antecedently very unlikely that a religious exile
would spare exertions to gain sympathy for himself and converts to his
opinions. As a matter of fact, Arianism had no more active supporters
during the next half-century than two bishops of the neighbouring
province of Pannonia, <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p67.1"></span>Valens</span> of Mursa (Mitrowitz), and <span
class="c10"><span id="v.ii.iv-p67.2"></span>Ursacius <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34) </span> of Singidunum (Belgrade.md). Valens
and Ursacius are described as pupils of Arius, and there is every reason
to trace their personal relations with the heresiarch to his Illyrian
exile. The seeds sown in Illyria at this time were still bearing fruit
nearly 50 years later (pp. 489, 494, note). Secundus nursed his
bitterness fully thirty years (p. 294; cf. 456). Theognis grasped at
revenge at Tyre in 335 (pp. 104, 114). Eusebius of Nicomedia, recalled
from exile with his friend and neighbour Theognis, not long after the
election of Athanasius in 328, was ready to move heaven and earth to
efface the results of the council. The harsh measures against the Arians
then, if insufficient to account for the reaction, at any rate furnished
it with the energy of personal bitterness and sense of wrong.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p69"></span>(2) *The Eusebians and the Court*. Until
the council of Sardica (i.e. a short time after the death of Eusebius of
Nicomedia), the motive power of the reaction proceeded from the
environment of Eusebius, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p69.1"></span>οἱ περὶ Εὐσέβιον</span>. It should be observed
once for all that the term ‘<span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p69.2"></span>Eusebians</span>’ is the later and inexact
equivalent of the last named Greek phrase, which (excepting perhaps p.
436) has reference to Eusebius of Nicomedia only, and not to his
namesake of Cæsarea. The latter, no doubt, lent his support to the
action of the party, but ought not to suffer in our estimation from the
misfortune of his name. Again, the ‘Eusebians’ are not a heresy, nor a
theological party or school; they are the ‘ring,’ or personal
*entourage,* of one man, a master of intrigue, who succeeded in
combining a very large number of men of very different opinions in more
or less close association for common ecclesiastical action. The
‘Eusebians’ *sensu latiori* are the majority of Asiatic bishops who were
in reaction against the council and its leaders; in the stricter sense
the term denotes the pure Arians like Eusebius, Theognis, and the rest,
and those ‘political Arians’ who without settled adherence to Arian
principles, were, for all practical purposes, hand in glove with
Eusebius and his fellows. To the former class emphatically belong Valens
and Ursacius, whose recantation in 347 is the solitary and insufficient
foundation for the sweeping generalisation of Socrates (ii. 37), that
they ‘always inclined to the party in power,’ and George, the presbyter
of Alexandria, afterwards bishop of the Syrian Laodicea, who, although
he went through a phase of ‘conservatism,’ 357–359, began and ended
(Gwatkin, pp. 181–183) as an Arian, pure and simple. Among ‘political
Arians’ of this period Eusebius of Cæsarea is the chief. He was not, as
we have said above, an Arian theologically, yet whatever allowances may
be made for his conduct during this period (D.C.B., ii. 315, 316) it
tended all in one direction. But on the whole, political Arianism is
more abundantly exemplified in the Homœans of the next generation, whose
activity begins about the time of the death of Constans. The Eusebians
proper were political indeed <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p69.3"></span>εἴ τινες καὶ ἄλλοι</span>, but their essential
Arianism is the one element of principle about them <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) . Above all, the employment of the term
‘Semi-Arians’ as a synonym for Eusebians, or indeed as a designation of
any party at this period, is to be strongly deprecated. It is the
(possibly somewhat misleading, but reasonable and accepted) term for the
younger generation of *convinced* ‘conservatives,’ whom we find in the
sixth decade of the century becoming conscious of their essential
difference in principle from the Arians, whether political or pure, and
feeling their way toward fusion with the Nicenes. These are a definite
party, with a definite theological position, to which nothing in the
earlier period exactly corresponds. The Eusebians proper were not
*semi-*, but *real* Arians. Eusebius *of Cæsarea* and the Asiatic
conservatives are the *predecessors* of the semi-Arians, but their
position is not quite the same. Reserving them for a moment, we must
complete our account of the Eusebians proper. Their nucleus consisted of
the able and influential circle of ‘Lucianists;’ it has been remarked by
an unprejudiced observer that, so far as we know, not one of them was
eminent as a *religious* character (Harnack, ii. 185); their strength
was in fixity of policy and in ecclesiastical intrigue; and their
battery was the imperial court. Within three years of the Council,
Constantine had begun to waver, not in his resolution to maintain the
Nicene Creed, *that* he never relaxed, but in his sternness toward its
known opponents. His policy was dictated by the desire for unity: he was
made to feel the lurking dissatisfaction of the bishops of Asia, perhaps
as his anger was softened by time he missed the ability and ready
counsel of the extruded bishop of his residential city. An Arian
presbyter (‘Eustathius’ or ‘Eutokius’?), who was a kind of chaplain to
Constantia, sister of Constantine and widow of Licinius, is said to have
kept the subject before the Emperor’s mind after her death (in 328, see
Socr. i. 25). At last, as we have seen, first Eusebius and Theognis were
recalled, then Arius himself was pardoned upon his general assurance of
agreement with the faith of the Synod.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p71"></span><span id="page_xxxv">p. xxxv</span> <span
id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxxv"></span>The atmosphere of a court is seldom
favourable to a high standard of moral or religious principle; and the
place-hunters and hangers-on of the imperial courts of these days were
an exceptionally worthless crew (see Gwatkin, p. 60, 100, 234). It is a
tribute to the Nicene cause that their influence was steadily on the
other side, and to the character of Constantine that he was able
throughout the greater part of the period to resist it, at any rate as
far as Athanasius was concerned. But on the whole the court was the
centre whence the webs of Eusebian intrigue extended to Egypt, Antioch,
and many other obscurer centres of attack.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p72"></span>The influences outside the Church were
less directly operative in the campaign, but such as they were they
served the Eusebian plans. The expulsion of a powerful bishop from the
midst of a loyal flock was greatly assisted by the co-operation of a
friendly mob; and Jews (pp. 94, 296), and heathen alike were willing to
aid the Arian cause. The army, the civil service, education, the life of
society were still largely heathen; the inevitable influx of heathen
into the Church, now that the empire had become Christian, brought with
it multitudes to whom Arianism was a more intelligible creed than that
of Nicæa; the influence of the philosophers was a serious factor, they
might well welcome Arianism as a ‘Selbstersetzung des Christentums.’
This is not inconsistent with the instances of persecution of heathenism
by Arian bishops, and of savage heathen reprisals, associated with the
names of George of Alexandria, Patrophilus, Mark of Arethusa, and
others. (For a fuller discussion, with references, see Gwatkin, pp.
53–59.)

<span id="v.ii.iv-p73"></span>(3.) *The Ecclesiastical Conservatives.*
Something has already been said in more than one connection to explain
how it came to pass that the very provinces whose bishops made up the
large numerical majority at Nicæa, also furnished the numbers which
swelled the ranks of the Eusebians at Tyre, Antioch, and Philippopolis.
The actual men were, of course, in many cases <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) changed in the course of years, but the
sees were the same, and there is ample evidence that the staunch Nicene
party were in a hopeless minority in Asia Minor <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) and but little stronger in Syria. The
indefiniteness of this mass of episcopal opinion justifies the title
‘Conservative.’ In adopting it freely, we must not forget, what the
whole foregoing account has gone to shew, that their conservatism was of
the empirical or short-sighted kind, prone to acquiesce in things as
they are, hard to arouse to a sense of a great crisis, reluctant to step
out of its groove. If by conservatism we mean action which really tends
to preserve the vital strength of an institution, then Athanasius and
the leaders of Nicæa were the only conservatives. But it is not an
unknown thing for vulgar conservatism to take alarm at the clear grasp
of principles and facts which alone can carry the State over a great
crisis, and by wrapping itself up in its prejudices to play into the
hands of anarchy. Common men do not easily rise to the level of mighty
issues. Where Demosthenes saw the crisis of his nation’s destiny,
Æschines saw materials for a personal impeachment of his rival. In the
anti-Nicene reaction the want of clearness of thought coincided with the
fatal readiness to magnify personal issues. Here was the opportunity of
the Arian leaders: a confused succession of personal skirmishes, in
which the mass of men saw no religious principle, nor any combined
purpose (Soc. i. 13, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p75.2"></span>νυκτομαχίας τε οὐδὲν ἀπεῖχε τὰ
γινόμενα</span>) was conducted from headquarters with a fixed steady
aim. But their machinations would have been fruitless had the mass of
the bishops been really in sympathy with the council to which they were
still by their own action committed. ‘Arian hatred of the council would
have been powerless if it had not rested on a formidable mass of
conservative discontent: while the conservative discontent might have
died away if the court had not supplied it with the means of action’
(Gwatkin, p. 61. He explains the policy of the court by the religious
sympathies of Asia Minor <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) and its
political importance, pp. 90–91.) But the authority of the council
remained unchallenged during the lifetime of Constantine, and no Arian
raised his voice against it. One doctrinal controversy there was, of
subordinate importance, but of a kind to rivet the conservatives to
their attitude of sullen reaction.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p77"></span>It follows from what has been said of the
influence of Origen in moulding the current theology of the Eastern
Church, that the one theological principle which was most vividly and
generally grasped was the horror of Monarchian and especially of
‘Sabellian’ teaching. Now in replying to Asterius the spokesman of early
Arianism, no less a person than <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p77.1"></span>Marcellus,</span> bishop of Ancyra (Angora) in
Galatia, and one of the principal leaders of Nicæa, had laid himself
open to this charge. It was brought with zeal and learning (in 336) in
two successive works by Eusebius of Cæsarea, which, with Ath., *Orat*.
iv. are our principal source of information as to the tenets of
Marcellus (see D.C.B. ii. 341, sq., Zahn *Marcellus* 99 *sqq*.,
fragments collected by Rettberg *Marcelliana*). On the other hand he was
uniformly supported by the Nicene party, and especially by Athanasius
and the Roman Church. His book was examined at Sardica, and on somewhat
*ex parte* grounds (p. 125) pronounced innocent: a personal estrangement
from Athanasius shortly after (Hilar. *Fragm*. ii. 21, 23) on account of
certain ‘ambiguæ prædicationes eius, in quam Photinus erupit, doctrinæ,’
did not amount to a formal breach of communion (he is mentioned 14 years
later as an exiled Nicene bishop, pp. 256, 271), nor did the anxious
questioning of Epiphanius (see *Hær*. 72. 4.) succeed in extracting from
the then aged Athanasius more than a significant smile. He refuses to
condemn him, and in arguing against opinions which appear to be his, he
refrains from mentioning the name <span id="page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</span>
<span id="v.ii.iv-Page_xxxvi"></span>even of Photinus <span
id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) . It may be well therefore to sketch in a
few touches what we know of the system of Marcellus, in order that we
may appreciate the relative right of Eusebius in attacking, and of
Athanasius and the Romans in supporting him. Marcellus is a
representative of the traditional theology of Asia Minor, as we find it
in Ignatius and Irenæus (see above, pp. xxii.–xxiv., xxvi. fin.), and is
independent of any influence of, or rather in conscious reaction
against, Origenism. We cannot prove that he had studied either Ignatius
or Irenæus, but we find the doctrine of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p78.2"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p78.3"></span>νακεφαλαίωσις</span> with reference to
Creation and the Incarnation, and the Ignatian thought of the Divine
Silence, and a general unmistakeable affinity (cf. Zahn 236–244).
Marcellus ‘appeals from Origen to S. John.’ He begins with the idea of
Sonship, as Arius and the Nicene Council had done. Perceiving that on
the one hand Arians and Origenists alike were led by the idea of Sonship
as dependent on paternal will to infer the inferiority of the Son to the
Father, and in the more extreme case to deny His coeternity, feeling on
the other hand (with Irenæus II. xxviii. 6) our inability to find an
idea to correspond with the relation implied in the eternal Sonship, he
turns to the first chapter of S. John as the classic passage for the
pre-existent nature of Christ. He finds that *before the Incarnation*
the Saviour is spoken of as Logos *only:* accordingly all other
designations, even that of Son, must be reserved for the Incarnate.
Moreover ([Joh. i. 1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p78.4"></span>) the Word is strictly coeternal, and no name
implying an act (such as <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p78.5"></span>γέννησις</span>) can express the relation of
the Word to God. But in view of the Divine Purpose of Creation and
Redemption (for the latter is involved in the former by the doctrine of
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p78.6"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p78.7"></span>νακεφαλαίωσις</span>)
there is a process, a stirring within the divine Monad. The Word which
is potentially (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p78.8"></span>δυναμει</span>) eternally latent in God
proceeds forth in Actuality (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p78.9"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p78.10"></span>νεργεί& 139·</span>), yet without ceasing to
be potentially in God as well. In this <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p78.11"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p78.12"></span>νέργεια δραστική</span>, to which the word
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p78.13"></span>γέννησις</span> may
be applied, begins the great drama of the Universe which rises to the
height of the Incarnation, and which, after the Economy is completed,
and fallen man restored (and more than restored) to the Sonship of God
which he had lost, ends in the return of the Logos to the Father, the
handing over of His Kingdom by the Son, that God may be all in all.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p79"></span>What strikes one throughout the scheme is
the intense difficulty caused to Marcellus by the unsolved problem which
underlies the whole theology of the Nicene leaders, the problem of
*personality.* The Manhood of Christ was to Marcellus *per se*
non-personal. The seat of its personality was the indwelling Logos. But
in what sense was the Logos itself personal? Here Marcellus loses his
footing: in what sense can any idea of personality attach to a merely
potential existence? Again, if it was only in the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p79.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p79.2"></span>νέργεια δραστικὴ</span>
that the personality of the Word was realised, and this only reached its
fulness in the Incarnation of Christ, was the transition difficult to
the plain assertion that the personality of the Son, or of the Word,
originated with the Incarnation? But if this were not so, and if the
Person of the Word was to recede at the consummation of all things into
the Unity of the Godhead, what was to become of the Nature He had
assumed? That it too could merge into a potential existence within the
Godhead was of course impossible; what then was its destiny? The answer
of Marcellus was simple: he did not know (Zahn, 179); for Scripture
taught nothing beyond [1 Cor. xv.
28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028.md)<span id="v.ii.iv-p79.3"></span>.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p80"></span>We now perceive the subtle difference
between Marcellus and Athanasius. Neither of them could formulate the
idea of Personality in the Holy Trinity. But Athanasius, apparently on
the basis of a more thorough intelligence of Scripture (for Marcellus,
though a devout, was a partial and somewhat ignorant biblical
theologian), felt what Marcellus did not, the steady inherent personal
distinctness of the Father and the Son. Accordingly, while Athanasius
laid down and adhered to the doctrine of eternal <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p80.1"></span>γέννησις</span>, Marcellus
involved himself in the mystical and confused idea of a divine <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p80.2"></span>πλατυσμὸς</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p80.3"></span>συστολή</span>. Moreover,
while Athanasius was clearsighted in his apprehension of the problem of
the day, Marcellus was after all merely conservative: he went behind the
conservatism of the Origenists,—behind even that of the West, where
Tertullian had left a sharper sense of personal distinction in the
Godhead,—to an archaic conservatism akin to the ‘naive modalism’ of the
early Church; upon this he engrafted reflexion, in part that of the old
Asiatic theology, in part his own. As the result, his faith was such as
Athanasius could not but recognise as sincere; but in his attempt to
give it theological expression he split upon the rocks of Personality,
of Eschatology, of the divine immutability. His theology was an honest
and interesting but mistaken attempt to grapple with a problem before he
understood another which lay at its base. In doing so he exposed himself
justly to attack; but we may with Athanasius, while acknowledging this,
retain a kindly sympathy for this veteran ally of many confessors and
sturdy opponent of the alliance between science and theology.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p81"></span>The feeling against Marcellus might have
been less strong, at any rate it would have had less show of reason, but
for the fact that he was the teacher of <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p81.1"></span>Photinus</span>. This person became bishop of
Sirmium between 330 and 340, gave great offence by his teaching, and was
deposed by the Arian party ineffectually in 347, finally in 351. After
his expulsion he occupied himself with writing books in Greek and in
Latin, including a work ‘against all heresies,’ in which he expounded
his own (Socr. ii. 30). None of his works have survived, and our
information is very scanty (Zahn, *Marc.* 189–196 is the best account),
but he seems to have solved the central difficulty of Marcellus by
placing the seat of the Personality of Christ in His Human Soul. How
much of the system of his master he retained is uncertain, but the
result was in substance pure Unitarianism. It is instructive to observe
that even Photinus was passively supported for a time by the Nicenes. He
was apparently (Hil. *Fr.* ii. 19, *sqq.*) condemned at a council at
Milan in 345, but not at Rome till 380. Athanasius (pp. 444–447)
abstains from mentioning his name although he refutes his opinions; once
only he mentions him as a heretic, and with apparent reluctance (c.
Apoll. ii. 19, <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iv-p81.2"></span>τοῦ
λεγομένου φωτεινοῦ</span>). The first <span
id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) condemnation of him on the Nicene side in
the East is by Paulinus of Antioch in 362 (p. 486). On the other hand
the Eusebians eagerly caught at so irresistible a weapon. Again and
again they hurled anathemas at Photinus, at first simply identifying him
with Marcellus, but afterwards with full appreciation of his position.
And even to the last the new Nicene party in Asia were aggrieved at the
refusal of the old Nicenes at Alexandria and Rome to anathematise the
master of such a heretic. Photinus was the scandal of Marcellus,
Marcellus of the Council of Nicæa.

left’ of the Origenist body. (‘A reflex of the unsolved problems of the
Church of that time,’ Dorner.) It is as though Dionysius instead of
withdrawing and modifying his incriminated statements, had involved them
in a haze of explanations and biblical phrases which left them where
they were. But this is not so much Arianism as confusion. ‘All is hollow
and empty, precarious and ambiguous. With a vast apparatus of biblical
expressions and the use of every possible formula, Monotheism is indeed
maintained, but practically a created subordinate God is inserted
between God and mankind’ (Harnack, p. 648). See also Dorner, *Lehre der
Pers. Chr.* Pt. 1, pp. 793–798. The language quoted by Ath. below, p.
459, was doubtless meant by Eusebius in an Origenist sense.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p34"></span> The theological genesis of Paul’s system
is obscure. The theory of Newman that he was under strong Jewish
influences is largely based upon the late and apparently quite erroneous
tradition that his patroness Zenobia was a Jewess; see p. 296, note 9a,
and Gwatkin, p. 57, and note 3. Harnack regards him as the
representative of ‘archaic’ East-Syrian adoptionism such as pervades the
‘Discussion of Archelaus with Manes;’ see Routh, *Rell.* v. especially
pp. 178–184. But Paul would not have spoken of Mary as ‘Dei Genetrix,’
p. 128; I cannot see more in these ‘Acta’ than a naive adoptionism
homologous to the ‘naive modalism’ of much early Christian language, but
like it not representative of the entire view of those who use it; we
must also note that the statements of ‘Archelaus’ are coloured by
reaction against the docetism of ‘Manes;’ but Paul may well have taken
up this naive adoptionism, and, *by strict Aristotelian logic,*
developed it as the exclusive basis of his system. Whether Paul’s use of
the idea of the Logos betrays the faintest influence of Origen is to me,
at least, extremely uncertain.

It came to the front in the system of Eunomius, and was much discussed

Conservative Dianius. But Asterius was as ready to compromise with
conservatism as he had formerly been with heathenism, and his anxiety
for a bishopric would carry him to even greater lengths in order to
attend a council under influential patronage.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p46"></span> A theology which aims at consistency must
borrow a method, a philosophy, from outside the sphere of religion. The
most developed system of Catholic theology, that of S. Thomas Aquinas,
borrows its method from the same source as did Arius,—Aristotle.

id="v.ii.iv-p47.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.iv-p48"></span> This illustrates the famous paradox of
Cardinal Newman (*Development,* ed. 1878, pp. 142–4), that the
condemnation of Arian Christology *left vacant* a throne in heaven which
the medieval Church legitimately filled with the Blessed Virgin; that
the Nicene condemnation of the Arian theology is the vindication of the
medieval; that ‘the votaries of Mary do not exceed the true faith,
unless the blasphemers of her Son come up to it.’ But the question here
was one of *worship,* not of *theology.* The Arians *worshipped* Christ,
whom they regarded as a created being: therefore, the Nicene fathers
urge with one consent, they were idolaters. The idea of a created being
*capable of being worshipped* was an Arian legacy to the Church, no
doubt. But this very idea, to Athanasius and Hilary, marked them out as
idolaters. It was reserved for later times ‘to find a subject for an
Arian predicate’ (Mozley). The argument is an astonishing admission.

equally opposed to Arianism and to Origen: see also p. 449 *sq.*

<span id="v.ii.iv-p68"></span> They were probably not yet bishops at
this time, as they were *young* bishops at Tyre in 335; evidently they
are ‘the fairest of God’s youthful flock’ (!) alluded to in Eus. *V. C.*
iv. 43.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p70"></span> At the same time Arius himself and all
his fellow Lucianists (unlike the obscure Secundus and Theonas, and the
later generation of Eunomians) are open to the charge of subserviency at
a pinch.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p74"></span> Alexander of Thessalonica had been at
Nicæa, Dianius of Cæs. Capp. had not. The two are typical of the better
sort of conservatives.

id="v.ii.iv-p74.2"></span>

<span id="v.ii.iv-p75"></span> For Asia besides Marcellus we have only
Diodorus of Tenedos, not at Nicæa, but expelled soon after 330, p. 271;
signs at Sardica, p. 147, banished again p. 276, not in D.C.B.; for
Syria the names p. 271, cf. p. 256.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p76"></span> Always an important factor in the
stability of the Byzantine throne, see, on Justinian, D.C.B. iii. 545a,
*sub fin.* Newman, *Arians,* Appendix v., brings no conclusive proof of
strong Nicene feeling among the masses of the laity in this region. But
‘the people’ in Galatia, according to Basil, remained devoted to
Marcellus.

id="v.ii.iv-p77.2"></span>

<span id="v.ii.iv-p78"></span> At the same time he adopts a certain
reserve in speaking of Marcellus, and his name is absent from the roll
of the orthodox, p. 227.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[xxxvi:41](2040016.htm#fr_40.md) <span
id="v.ii.iv-p81.3"></span>

<span id="v.ii.iv-p82"></span> But he is condemned by name in the
alleged Coptic Acts of the Council of 362; moreover Eustathius appears
to have written against him, see Cowper, *Syr. Misc.* 60.
