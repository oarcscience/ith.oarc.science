<span id="xx.ii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c8"><span
id="xx.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Part V.</span>

<span id="xx.ii.v-p2"></span><span class="c40"><span
id="xx.ii.v-p2.1"></span>Persecution and Lapse of Liberius</span>

<span id="xx.ii.v-p3"></span>35. Now it had been better if from the
first Constantius had never become connected with this heresy at all; or
being connected with it, if he had not yielded so much to those impious
men; or having yielded to them, if he had stood by them only thus far,
so that judgment might come upon them all for these atrocities alone.
But as it would seem, like madmen, having fixed themselves in the bonds
of impiety, they are drawing down upon their own heads a more severe
judgment. Thus from the first <span id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md)
they spared not even Liberius, Bishop of Rome, but extended <span
id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md) their fury even to those parts;
they respected not his bishopric, because it was an Apostolical throne;
they felt no reverence for Rome, because she is the Metropolis of
Romania <span id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622.md) ; they remembered not
that formerly in their letters they had spoken of her Bishops as
Apostolical men. But confounding all things together, they at once
forgot everything, and cared only to shew their zeal in behalf of
impiety. When they perceived that he was an orthodox man and hated the
Arian heresy, and earnestly endeavoured to persuade all persons to
renounce and withdraw from it, these impious men reasoned thus with
themselves: ‘If we can persuade Liberius, we shall soon prevail over
all.’ Accordingly they accused him falsely before the Emperor; and he,
expecting easily to draw over all men to his side by means of Liberius,
writes to him, and sends a certain eunuch called Eusebius with letters
and offerings, to cajole him with the presents, and to threaten him with
the letters. The eunuch accordingly went to Rome, and first proposed to
Liberius to subscribe against Athanasius, and to hold communion with the
Arians, saying, ‘The Emperor wishes it, and commands you to do so.’ And
then shewing him the offerings, he took him by the hand, and again
besought him saying, ‘Obey the Emperor, and receive these.’

<span id="xx.ii.v-p7"></span>36. *The Eunuch Eusebius attempts Liberius
in vain.*

<span id="xx.ii.v-p8"></span>But the Bishop endeavoured to convince him,
reasoning with him thus: ‘How is it possible for me to do this against
Athanasius? how can we condemn a man, whom not one <span
id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md) Council only, but a second <span
id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md) assembled from all parts of the
world, has fairly acquitted, and whom the Church of the Romans dismissed
in peace? who will approve of our conduct, if we reject in his absence
one, whose presence <span id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625.md) amongst
us we gladly welcomed, and admitted him to our communion? This is no
Ecclesiastical Canon; nor have we had transmitted to us any such
tradition <span id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626.md) from the Fathers,
who in their turn received from the great and blessed Apostle
Peter <span id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md) . But if the Emperor is
really concerned for the peace of the Church, if he requires our letters
respecting Athanasius to be reversed, let their proceedings both against
him and against all the others be reversed also; and then let an
Ecclesiastical Council be called at a distance from the Court, at which
the Emperor shall not be present, nor any Count be admitted, nor
magistrate to threaten us, but where only the fear of God and the
Apostolical rule <span id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628.md) shall
prevail; that so in the first place, the faith of the Church may be
secure, as the Fathers defined it in the Council of Nicæa, and the
supporters of the Arian doctrines may be cast out, and their heresy
anathematized. And then after that, an enquiry being made into the
charges brought against Athanasius, and any other besides, as well as
into those things of which the other party is accused, let the culprits
be cast out, and the innocent receive encouragement and support. For it
is impossible that they who maintain an impious creed can be admitted as
members of a Council: nor is it fit that an enquiry into matters of
conduct should precede the enquiry concerning the faith <span
id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629.md) ; but all diversity of opinions on
points of faith ought first to be eradicated, and then the enquiry made
into matters of conduct. Our Lord Jesus Christ did not heal them that
were afflicted, until they shewed and declared what faith they had in
Him. These things we have received from the Fathers; these report to the
Emperor; for they are both profitable for him and edifying to the
Church. But let not Ursacius and Valens be listened to, for they have
retracted their former assertions, and in what they now say they are not
to be trusted.’

<span id="xx.ii.v-p16"></span><span id="page_283">p. 283</span> <span
id="xx.ii.v-Page_283"></span>37. *Liberius refuses the Emperor’s
offering.*

<span id="xx.ii.v-p17"></span>These were the words of the Bishop
Liberius. And the eunuch, who was vexed, not so much because he would
not subscribe, as because he found him an enemy to the heresy,
forgetting that he was in the presence of a Bishop, after threatening
him severely, went away with the offerings; and next commits an offence,
which is foreign to a Christian, and too audacious for a eunuch. In
imitation of the transgression of Saul, he went to the Martyry <span
id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md) of the Apostle Peter, and then
presented the offerings. But Liberius having notice of it, was very
angry with the person who kept the place, that he had not prevented him,
and cast out the offerings as an unlawful sacrifice, which increased the
anger of the mutilated creature against him. Consequently he exasperates
the Emperor against him, saying, ‘The matter that concerns us is no
longer the obtaining the subscription of Liberius, but the fact that he
is so resolutely opposed to the heresy, that he anathematizes the Arians
by name.’ He also stirs up the other eunuchs to say the same; for many
of those who were about Constantius, or rather the whole number of them,
are eunuchs <span id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631.md) , who engross all
the influence with him, and it is impossible to do anything there
without them. The Emperor accordingly writes to Rome, and again
Palatines, and Notaries, and Counts are sent off with letters to the
Prefect, in order that either they may inveigle Liberius by stratagem
away from Rome and send him to the Court to him, or else persecute him
by violence.

<span id="xx.ii.v-p20"></span>38. *The evil influence of Eunuchs at
Court.*

<span id="xx.ii.v-p21"></span>Such being the tenor of the letters, there
also fear and treachery forthwith became rife throughout the whole city.
How many were the families against which threats were held out! How many
received great promises on condition of their acting against Liberius!
How many Bishops hid themselves when they saw these things! How many
noble women retired to country places in consequence of the calumnies of
the enemies of Christ! How many ascetics were made the objects of their
plots! How many who were sojourning there, and had made that place their
home, did they cause to be persecuted! How often and how strictly did
they guard the harbour <span id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md) and
the approaches to the gates, lest any orthodox person should enter and
visit Liberius! Rome also had trial of the enemies of Christ, and now
experienced what before she would not believe, when she heard how the
other Churches in every city were ravaged by them. It was the eunuchs
who instigated these proceedings against all. And the most remarkable
circumstance in the matter is this; that the Arian heresy which denies
the Son of God, receives its support from eunuchs, who, as both their
bodies are fruitless, and their souls barren of virtue, cannot bear even
to hear the name of son. The Eunuch of Ethiopia indeed, though he
understood not what he read <span id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md) ,
believed the words of Philip, when he taught him concerning the Saviour;
but the eunuchs of Constantius cannot endure the confession of
Peter <span id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md) , nay, they turn away
when the Father manifests the Son, and madly rage against those who say,
that the Son of God is His genuine Son, thus claiming as a heresy of
eunuchs, that there is no genuine and true offspring of the Father. On
these grounds it is that the law forbids such persons to be admitted
into any ecclesiastical Council <span
id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) ; notwithstanding which they have
now regarded these as competent judges of ecclesiastical causes, and
whatever seems good to them, that Constantius decrees, while men with
the name of Bishops dissemble with them. Oh! who shall be their
historian? who shall transmit the record of these things to another
generation? who indeed would believe it, were he to hear it, that
eunuchs who are scarcely entrusted with household services (for theirs
is a pleasure-loving race, that has no serious concern but that of
hindering in others what nature has taken from them); that these, I say,
now exercise authority in ecclesiastical matters, and that Constantius
in submission to their will treacherously conspired against all, and
banished Liberius!

<span id="xx.ii.v-p26"></span>39. *Liberius’s speech to Constantius.*

<span id="xx.ii.v-p27"></span>For after the Emperor had frequently
written to Rome, had threatened, sent commissioners, devised schemes, on
the persecution <span id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md) subsequently
breaking out at Alexandria, Liberius is dragged before him, and uses
great boldness of speech towards him. ‘Cease,’ he said, ‘to persecute
the Christians; attempt not by my means to introduce impiety into the
Church. We are ready to suffer anything rather than to be called Arian
madmen. We are Christians; compel us not to become enemies of Christ. We
also give you this counsel: fight not against Him who gave you this
empire, nor shew impiety towards Him instead of thankful<span
id="page_284">p. 284</span> <span
id="xx.ii.v-Page_284"></span>ness <span
id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) ;’ persecute not them that believe
in Him, lest you also hear the words, ‘It is hard for thee to kick
against the pricks <span id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md) .’ Nay, I
would that you might hear them, that you might obey, as the holy Paul
did. Behold, here we are; we are come, before they fabricate charges.
For this cause we hastened hither, knowing that banishment awaits us at
your hands, that we might suffer before a charge encounters us, and that
all may clearly see that all the others too have suffered as we shall
suffer, and that the charges brought against them were fabrications of
their enemies, and all their proceedings were mere calumny and
falsehood.’

<span id="xx.ii.v-p31"></span>40. *Banishment of Liberius and others.*

<span id="xx.ii.v-p32"></span>These were the words of Liberius at that
time, and he was admired by all men for them. But the Emperor instead of
answering <span id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md) , only gave orders
for their banishment, separating each of them from the rest, as he had
done in the former cases. For he had himself devised this plan in the
banishments which he inflicted, that so the severity of his punishments
might be greater than that of former tyrants and persecutors <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) . In the former persecution
Maximian, who was then Emperor, commanded a number of Confessors to be
banished together <span id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641.md) , and thus
lightened their punishment by the consolation which he gave them in each
other’s society. But this man was more savage than he; he separated
those who had spoken boldly and confessed together, he put asunder those
who were united by the bond of faith, that when they came to die they
might not see one another; thinking that bodily separation can disunite
also the affections of the mind, and that being severed from each other,
they would forget the concord and unanimity which existed among them. He
knew not that however each one may remain <span
id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642.md) apart from the rest, he has
nevertheless with him that Lord, whom they confessed in one body
together, who will also provide (as he did in the case of the Prophet
Elisha <span id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643) .md) that more shall be
with each of them, than there are soldiers with Constantius. Of a truth
iniquity is blind; for in that they thought to afflict the Confessors,
by separating them from one another, they rather brought thereby a great
injury upon themselves. For had they continued in each other’s company,
and abode together, the pollutions of those impious men would have been
proclaimed from one place only; but now by putting them asunder, they
have made their impious heresy and wickedness to spread abroad and
become known in every place <span id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644.md) .

<span id="xx.ii.v-p39"></span>41. *Lapse of Liberius.*

<span id="xx.ii.v-p40"></span>Who that shall hear what they did in the
course of these proceedings will not think them to be anything rather
than Christians? When Liberius sent Eutropius, a Presbyter, and
Hilarius, a Deacon, with letters to the Emperor, at the time that
Lucifer and his fellows made their confession, they banished the
Presbyter on the spot, and after stripping Hilarius <span
id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645.md) the Deacon and scourging him on the
back, they banished him too, clamouring at him, ‘Why didst thou not
resist Liberius instead of being the bearer of letters from him.’
Ursacius and Valens, with the eunuchs who sided with them, were the
authors of this outrage. The Deacon, while he was being scourged,
praised the Lord, remembering His words, ‘I gave My back to the
smiters <span id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646.md) ;’ but they while
they scourged him laughed and mocked him, feeling no shame that they
were insulting a Levite. Indeed they acted but consistently in laughing
while he continued to praise God; for it is the part of Christians to
endure stripes, but to scourge Christians is the outrage of a Pilate or
a Caiaphas. Thus they endeavoured at the first to corrupt the Church of
the Romans, wishing to introduce impiety into it as well as others. But
Liberius after he had been in banishment two years gave way, and from
fear of threatened death subscribed. Yet even this only shews their
violent conduct, and the hatred of Liberius against the heresy, and his
support of Athanasius, so long as he was suffered to exercise a free
choice. For that which men are forced by torture to do contrary to their
first judgment, ought not to be considered the willing deed of those who
are in fear, but rather of their tormentors. They however attempted
everything in support of their heresy, while the people in every Church,
preserving the faith which they had learnt, waited for the return of
their teachers, and condemned the Antichristian heresy, and all avoid
it, as they would a serpent.
