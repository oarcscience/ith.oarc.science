<span id="xvi.ii.xviii-p1"></span> 51. So he was alone in the inner
mountain, spending his time in prayer and discipline. And the brethren
who served him asked that they might come every month and bring him
olives, pulse and oil, for by now he was an old man. There then he
passed his life, and endured such great wrestlings, ‘Not against flesh
and blood <span id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093.md) ,’ as it is
written, but against opposing demons, as we learned from those who
visited him. For there they heard tumults, many voices, and, as it were,
the clash of arms. At night they saw the mountain become full of wild
beasts, and him also fighting as though against visible beings, and
praying against them. And those who came to him he encouraged, while
kneeling he contended and prayed to the Lord. Surely it was a marvellous
thing that a man, alone in such a desert, feared neither the demons who
rose up against him, nor the fierceness of the four-footed beasts and
creeping things, for all they were so many. But in truth, as it is
written, ‘He trusted in the Lord as Mount Sion <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094.md) ,’ with a mind unshaken and
undisturbed; so that the demons rather fled from him, and the wild
beasts, as it is written <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095.md) ,
‘kept peace with him.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xviii-p5"></span>52. The devil, therefore, as David
says in the Psalms <span id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096.md) , observed
Antony and gnashed his teeth against him. But Antony was consoled by the
Saviour and continued unhurt by his wiles and varied devices. As he was
watching in the night the devil sent wild beasts against him. And almost
all the hyenas in that desert came forth from their dens and surrounded
him; and he was in the midst, while each one threatened to bite. Seeing
that it was a trick of the enemy he said to them all: ‘If ye have
received power against me I am ready to be devoured by you; but if ye
were sent against me by demons, stay not, but depart, for I am a servant
of Christ.’ When Antony said this they fled, driven by that word as with
a whip.

<span id="xvi.ii.xviii-p7"></span>53. A few days after, as he was
working (for he was careful to work hard), some one stood at the door
and pulled the plait which he was working, for he used to weave baskets,
which he gave to those who came in return for what they brought him. And
rising up he saw a beast like a man to the thighs but having legs and
feet like those of an ass. And Antony only signed himself and said, ‘I
am a servant of Christ. If thou art sent against me, behold I am here.’
But the beast together with his evil spirits fled, so that, through his
speed, he fell and died. And the death of the beast was the fall of the
demons. For they strove in all manner of ways to lead Antony from the
desert and were not able.
