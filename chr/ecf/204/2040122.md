<span id="vii.ii.xxv-p1"></span> §25. *Why the Cross, of all deaths? (1)
He had to bear the curse for us. (2) On it He held out His hands to
unite all, Jews and Gentiles, in Himself. (3) He defeated the “Prince of
the powers of the air” in His own region, clearing the way to heaven and
opening for us the everlasting doors.*

<span id="vii.ii.xxv-p2"></span>And thus much in reply to those without
who pile up arguments for themselves. But if any of our own people also
inquire, not from love of debate, but from love of learning, why He
suffered death in none other way save on the Cross, let him also be told
that no other way than this was good for us, and that it was well that
the Lord suffered this for our sakes. 2. For if He came Himself to bear
the curse laid upon us, how else could He have “become <span
id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265) a curse,” unless He received the death
set for a curse? and that is the Cross. For this is exactly what is
written: “Cursed <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266) is he that
hangeth on a tree.” 3. Again, if the Lord’s death is the ransom of all,
and by His death “the middle <span id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267)
wall of partition” is broken down, and the calling of the nations is
brought about, how would He have called us to Him, had He not been
crucified? For it is only on the cross that a man dies with his hands
spread out. Whence it was fitting for the Lord to bear this also and to
spread out His hands, that with the one He might draw the ancient
people, and with the other those from the Gentiles, and unite both in
Himself. 4. For this is what He Himself has said, signifying by what
manner of death <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span
id="vii.ii.xxv-Page_50"></span>He was to ransom all: “I, when <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268) I am lifted up,” He saith, “shall draw
all men unto Me.” 5. And once more, if the devil, the enemy of our race,
having fallen from heaven, wanders about our lower atmosphere, and there
bearing rule over his fellow-spirits, as his peers in disobedience, not
only works illusions by their means in them that are deceived, but tries
to hinder them that are going up (and about this <span
id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269) the Apostle says: “According to the
prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the
sons of disobedience”); while the Lord came to cast down the devil, and
clear the air and prepare the way for us up into heaven, as said the
Apostle: “Through <span id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270) the veil, that
is to say, His flesh”—and this must needs be by death—well, by what
other kind of death could this have come to pass, than by one which took
place in the air, I mean the cross? for only he that is perfected on the
cross dies in the air. Whence it was quite fitting that the Lord
suffered this death. 6. For thus being lifted up He cleared the
air <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271) of the malignity both of the
devil and of demons of all kinds, as He says: “I beheld <span
id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272) Satan as lightning fall from heaven;”
and made a new opening of the way up into heaven as He says once more:
“Lift <span id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273) up your gates, O ye
princes, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors.” For it was not the
Word Himself that needed an opening of the gates, being Lord of all; nor
were any of His works closed to their Maker; but we it was that needed
it whom He carried up by His own body. For as He offered it to death on
behalf of all, so by it He once more made ready the way up into the
heavens.

[Next: Reasons for His rising on the Third Day. (1) Not sooner for else
His real death would be denied, nor (2) later; to (a) guard the identity
of His body, (b) not to keep His disciples too long in suspense, nor (c)
to wait till the witnesses of His death were dispersed, or its memory
faded.](2040123)
