<span id="xviii.ii.xiv-p1"></span> 14. *The third charge, of using an
undedicated Church.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xiv-p2"></span>But forasmuch as they have informed
against me in the matter of the great Church <span
id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329.md) , that a communion was holden there
before it was completed, I will answer to your Piety on this charge
also; for the parties who are hostile towards me constrain me to do so.
I confess this did so happen; for, as in what I have hitherto said, I
have spoken no lie, I will not now deny this. But the facts are far
otherwise than they have represented them. Suffer me to declare to you,
most religious Augustus, that we kept no day of dedication (it would
certainly have been unlawful to do so, before receiving orders from
you), nor were we led to act as we did through premeditation. No Bishop
or other Clergyman was invited to join in our proceedings; for much was
yet wanting to complete the building. Nay the congregation was not held
on a previous notice, which might give them a reason for informing
against us. Every one knows how it happened; hear me, however, with your
accustomed equity and patience. It was the feast of Easter <span
id="fr_1330"></span>[1331](#fn_1330.md) , and the multitude assembled
together was exceeding great, such as Christian kings would desire to
see in all their cities. Now when the Churches were found to be too few
to contain them, there was no little stir among the people, who desired
that they might be allowed to meet together in the great Church, where
they could all offer up their prayers for your safety. And this they
did; for although I exhorted them to wait awhile, and to hold service in
the other Churches, with whatever inconvenience to themselves, they
would not listen to me; but were ready to go out of the city, and meet
in desert places in the open air, thinking it better to endure the
fatigue of the journey, than to keep the feast in such a state of
discomfort.
