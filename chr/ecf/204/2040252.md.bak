<span id="xvi.ii.xli-p1"></span> 88. For this was the wonderful thing in
Antony’s discipline, that, as I said before, having the gift of
discerning spirits, he recognised their movements, and was not ignorant
whither any one of them turned his energy and made his attack. And not
only was he not deceived by them himself, but cheering those who were
troubled with doubts, he taught them how to defeat their plans, telling
them of the weakness and craft of those who possessed them. Thus each
one, as though prepared by him for battle, came down from the mountain,
braving the designs of the devil and his demons. How many maidens who
had suitors, having but seen Antony from afar, remained maidens for
Christ’s sake. And people came also from foreign parts to him, and like
all others, having got some benefit, returned, as though set forward by
a father. And certainly when he died, all as having been bereft of a
father, consoled themselves solely by their remembrances of him,
preserving at the same time his counsel and advice.
