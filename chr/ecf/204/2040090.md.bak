<span id="vi.ii.iii.ix-p1"></span> §43. *Three similes to illustrate the
Word’s relation to the Universe*.

<span id="vi.ii.iii.ix-p2"></span>And for so great a matter to be
understood by an example, let what we are describing be compared to a
great chorus. As then the chorus is composed of different people,
children, women again, and old men, and those who are still young, and,
when one, namely the conductor, gives the sign, each utters sound
according to his nature and power, the man as a man, the child as a
child, the old man as an old man, and the young man as a young man,
while all make up a single harmony; 2. or as our soul at one time moves
our several senses according to the proper function of each, so that
when some one object is present all alike are put in motion, and the eye
sees, the ear hears, the hand touches, the smell takes in odour, and the
palate tastes,—and often the other parts of the body act too, as for
instance if the feet walk; 3. or, to make our meaning plain by yet a
third example, it is as though a very great city were built, and
administered under the presence of the ruler and king who has built it;
for when he is present and gives orders, and has his eye upon
everything, all obey; some busy themselves with agriculture, others
hasten for water to the aqueducts, another goes forth to procure
provisions,—one goes to senate, another enters the assembly, the judge
goes to the bench, and the magistrate to his court. The workman likewise
settles to his craft, the sailor goes down to the sea, the carpenter to
his workshop, the physician to his treatment, the architect to his
building; and while one is going to the country, another is returning
from the country, and while some walk about the town others are going
out of the town and returning to it again: but all this is going on and
is organised by the presence of the one Ruler, and by his management: 4.
in like manner then we must conceive of the whole of Creation, even
though the example be inadequate, yet with an enlarged idea. For with
the single impulse of a nod as it were of the Word of God, all things
simultaneously fall into order, and each discharge their proper
functions, and a single order is made up by them all together.
