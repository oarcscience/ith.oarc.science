<span id="xviii.ii.xv-p1"></span> 15. *Want of room the cause, precedent
the justification.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xv-p2"></span>Believe me, Sire, and let Truth be my
witness in this also, when I declare that in the congregations held
during the season of Lent, in consequence of the narrow limits of the
places, and the vast multitude of people assembled, a great number of
children, not a few of the younger and very many of the older women,
besides several young men, suffered so much from the pressure of the
crowd, that they were obliged to be carried home; though by the
Providence of God, no one is dead. All however murmured, and demanded
the use of the great Church. And if the pressure was so great during the
days which preceded the feast, what would have been the case during the
feast itself? Of course matters would have been far worse. It did not
therefore become me to change the people’s joy into grief, their
cheerfulness into sorrow, and to make the festival a season of
lamentation.

<span id="xviii.ii.xv-p3"></span>And that the more, because I had a
precedent in the conduct of our Fathers. For the blessed Alexander, when
the other places were too small, and he was engaged in the erection of
what was then considered a very large one, the Church of Theonas <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[1332](#fn_1331.md) , held <span id="page_244">p.
244</span> <span id="xviii.ii.xv-Page_244"></span>his congregations
there on account of the number of the people, while at the same time he
proceeded with the building. I have seen the same thing done at Treveri
and at Aquileia, in both which places, while the building was
proceeding, they assembled there during the feasts, on account of the
number of the people and they never found any one to accuse them in this
manner. Nay, your brother of blessed memory was present, when a
communion was held under these circumstances at Aquileia. I also
followed this course. There was no dedication, but only a service of
prayer. You, at least I am sure, as a lover of God will approve of the
people’s zeal, and will pardon me for being unwilling to hinder the
prayers of so great a multitude.
