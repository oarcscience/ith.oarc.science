<span id="v.v.ii-p1"></span> §2. *Principles and Method.*

<span id="v.v.ii-p2"></span>The determination of the leading Athanasian
dates depends mainly on the value to be assigned to the primary sources,
§1 (1). Reserving the fuller discussion of these texts for the
Introduction to the *Letters* (pp. 495 *sq*., 500 *sq*.), it will
suffice to state here what seem to be the results of an investigation of
their value. (1) The *Historia Acephala* and *Festal Index* are
independent of each other (cf. Sievers, p. 95, misunderstood, I think,
by Mr. Gwatkin, p. 221). (2) They both belong to the generation after
the death of Athanasius, the *H. A.* being apparently the earlier. (3)
The data as to which they agree must, therefore, come from a source
prior to either, i.e., contemporary with Athanasius. (4) In several
important particulars they are confirmed by our secondary Egyptian
sources, such as the *Letter of Ammon* and *Life of Pachomius*. (5) They
verify most of the best results arrived at independently of them (of
this below), and (6) In no case do they agree in fixing a date which can
be proved to be wrong, or which there are sound reasons for distrusting.
On these grounds I have classed the *Historia* and *Index* as primary
sources, and maintain that the dates as to which the two documents agree
must be accepted as certain. This principle at once brings the doubtful
points in the chronology within very moderate limits. The general
chronological table, in which the dates fixed by the agreement of these
sources are printed in black type, will make this plain enough. It
remains to shew that the principle adopted works out well in detail, or
in other words, that the old Alexandrian chronology, transmitted to us
through the twofold channel of the *Historia* and the *Index*,
harmonises the apparent discrepancies, and solves the difficulties, of
the chronological statements of Athanasius, and tallies with the most
trustworthy information derived from other sources. In some cases it has
been found desirable to discuss points of chronology where they occur in
the Life of Athanasius; what will be attempted here is to complete what
is there passed over without thorough discussion, in justification of
the scheme adopted in our general chronological table.
