<span id="xix.ii.v-p1"></span> 5. *In praise of Hosius.*

<span id="xix.ii.v-p2"></span>Of the great Hosius <span
id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408.md) , who answers to his name, that
confessor of a happy old age, it is superfluous for me to speak, for I
suppose it is known unto all men that they caused him also to be
banished; for he is not an obscure person, but of all men the most
illustrious, and more than this. When was there a Council held, in which
he did not take the lead <span id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409.md) ,
and by right counsel convince every one? Where is there a Church that
does not possess some glorious monuments of his patronage? Who has ever
come to him in sorrow, and has not gone away rejoicing? What needy
person ever asked his aid, and did not obtain what he desired? And yet
even on this man they made their assault, because knowing the calumnies
which they invent in behalf of their iniquity, he would not subscribe to
their designs against us. And if afterwards, upon the repeated stripes
above measure that were inflicted upon him, and the conspiracies that
were formed against his kinsfolk, he yielded <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410.md) to them for a time <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411.md) , as being old and infirm in body,
yet at least their wickedness is shewn even in this circumstance; so
zealously did they endeavour by all means to prove that they were not
truly Christians.
