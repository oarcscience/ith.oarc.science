<span id="xvi.ii.v-p1"></span> 5. But the devil, who hates and envies
what is good, could not endure to see such a resolution in a youth, but
endeavoured to carry out against him what he had been wont to effect
against others. First of all he tried to lead him away from the
discipline, whispering to him the remembrance of <span id="page_197">p.
197</span> <span id="xvi.ii.v-Page_197"></span>his wealth, care for his
sister, claims of kindred, love of money, love of glory, the various
pleasures of the table and the other relaxations of life, and at last
the difficulty of virtue and the labour of it; he suggested also the
infirmity of the body and the length of the time. In a word he raised in
his mind a great dust of debate, wishing to debar him from his settled
purpose. But when the enemy saw himself to be too weak for Antony’s
determination, and that he rather was conquered by the other’s firmness,
overthrown by his great faith and falling through his constant prayers,
then at length putting his trust in the weapons which are <span
id="fr_998"></span>[999](#fn_998) ‘in the navel of his belly’ and
boasting in them—for they are his first snare for the young—he attacked
the young man, disturbing him by night and harassing him by day, so that
even the onlookers saw the struggle which was going on between them. The
one would suggest foul thoughts and the other counter them with prayers:
the one fire him with lust, the other, as one who seemed to blush,
fortify his body with faith, prayers, and fasting. And the devil,
unhappy wight, one night even took upon him the shape of a woman and
imitated all her acts simply to beguile Antony. But he, his mind filled
with Christ and the nobility inspired by Him, and considering the
spirituality of the soul, quenched the coal of the other’s deceit. Again
the enemy suggested the ease of pleasure. But he like a man filled with
rage and grief turned his thoughts to the threatened fire and the
gnawing worm, and setting these in array against his adversary, passed
through the temptation unscathed. All this was a source of shame to his
foe. For he, deeming himself like God, was now mocked by a young man;
and he who boasted himself against flesh and blood was being put to
flight by a man in the flesh. For the Lord was working with Antony—the
Lord who for our sake took flesh <span
id="fr_999"></span>[1000](#fn_999) and gave the body victory over the
devil, so that all who truly fight can say <span
id="fr_1000"></span>[1001](#fn_1000) , ‘not I but the grace of God which
was with me.’

<span id="xvi.ii.v-p5"></span>6. At last when the dragon could not even
thus overthrow Antony, but saw himself thrust out of his heart, gnashing
his teeth as it is written, and as it were beside himself, he appeared
to Antony like a black boy, taking a visible shape <span
id="fr_1001"></span>[1002](#fn_1001) in accordance with the colour of
his mind. And cringing to him, as it were, he plied him with thoughts no
longer, for guileful as he was, he had been worsted, but at last spoke
in human voice and said, ‘Many I deceived, many I cast down; but now
attacking thee and thy labours as I had many others, I proved weak.’
When Antony asked, Who art thou who speakest thus with me? he answered
with a lamentable voice, ‘I am the friend of whoredom, and have taken
upon me incitements which lead to it against the young. I am called the
spirit of lust. How many have I deceived who wished to live soberly, how
many are the chaste whom by my incitements I have over-persuaded! I am
he on account of whom also the prophet reproves those who have fallen,
saying <span id="fr_1002"></span>[1003](#fn_1002) , “Ye have been caused
to err by the spirit of whoredom.” For by me they have been tripped up.
I am he who have so often troubled thee and have so often been
overthrown by thee.’ But Antony having given thanks to the Lord, with
good courage said to him, ‘Thou art very despicable then, for thou art
black-hearted and weak as a child. Henceforth I shall have no trouble
from thee <span id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003) , “for the Lord is
my helper, and I shall look down on mine enemies.”’ Having heard this,
the black one straightway fled, shuddering at the words and dreading any
longer even to come near the man.
