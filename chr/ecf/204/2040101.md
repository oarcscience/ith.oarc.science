<span id="vii.ii.iv-p1"></span> §4. *Our creation and God’s Incarnation
most intimately connected. As by the Word man was called from
non-existence into being, and further received the grace of a divine
life, so by the one fault which forfeited that life they again incurred
corruption and untold sin and misery filled the world.*

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p2"></span>You are wondering, perhaps, for what
possible reason, having proposed to speak of the Incarnation of the
Word, we are at present treating of the origin of mankind. But this,
too, properly belongs to the aim of our treatise. 2. For in speaking of
the appearance of the Saviour amongst us, we must needs speak also of
the origin of men, that you may know that the reason of His coming down
was because of us, and that our transgression <span
id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) called forth the loving-kindness of
the Word, that the Lord should both make haste to help us and appear
among men. 3. For of His becoming Incarnate we were the object, and for
our salvation He dealt so lovingly as to appear and be born even in a
human body. 4. Thus, then, God has made man, and willed that he should
abide in incorruption; but men, having despised and rejected the
contemplation of God, and devised and contrived evil for themselves (as
was said <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) in the former
treatise), received the condemnation of death with which they had been
threatened; and from thenceforth no longer remained as they were made,
but <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) were being corrupted
according to their devices; and death had the mastery over them as
king <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) . For transgression of the
commandment was turning them back to their natural state, so that just
as they have had their being out of nothing, so also, as might be
expected, they might look for corruption into nothing in the course of
time. 5. For if, out of a former normal state of non-existence, they
were called into being by the Presence and loving-kindness of the Word,
it followed naturally that when men were bereft of the knowledge of God
and were turned back to what was not (for what is evil is not, but what
is good is), they should, since they derive their being from God who IS,
be everlastingly bereft even of being; in other words, that they should
be disintegrated and abide in death and corruption. 6. For man is by
nature mortal, inasmuch as he is made out of what is not; but by reason
of his likeness to Him that is (and if he still preserved this likeness
by keeping Him in his knowledge) he would stay his natural corruption,
and remain incorrupt; as Wisdom <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md)
says: “The taking heed to His laws is the assurance of immortality;” but
being incorrupt, he would live henceforth as God, to which I suppose the
divine Scripture refers, when it says: “I have <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) said ye are gods, and ye are all sons
of the most Highest; but ye die like men, and fall as one of the
princes.”
