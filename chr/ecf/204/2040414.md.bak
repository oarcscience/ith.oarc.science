<span id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Letter III</span>.—*For 331. Easter-day
xvi Pharmuthi; iii Id. April; Æra Dioclet. 47; Coss. Annius Bassus,
Ablabius; Præfect, Florentius; Indict. iv.*

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>Again</span>, my beloved brethren, the
day of the feast draws near to us, which, above all others, should be
devoted to prayer, which the law commands to be observed, and which it
would be an unholy thing for us to pass over in silence. For although we
have been held under restraint by those who afflict us, that, because of
them, we should not announce to you this season; yet thanks be to ‘God,
who comforteth the afflicted <span id="fr_3974"></span>[3975](#fn_3974.md)
,’ that we have <span id="page_513">p. 513</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-Page_513"></span>not been overcome by the wickedness
of our accusers and silenced; but obeying the voice of truth, we
together with you cry aloud in the day of the feast. For the God of all
hath commanded, saying, ‘Speak <span
id="fr_3975"></span>[3976](#fn_3975.md) , and the children of Israel shall
keep the Passover.’ And the Spirit exhorts in the Psalm; ‘Blow the
trumpet in the new moons <span id="fr_3976"></span>[3977](#fn_3976.md) , in
the solemn day of your feast.’ And the prophet cries; ‘Keep thy feasts,
O Judah <span id="fr_3977"></span>[3978](#fn_3977.md) .’ I do not send word
to you as though you were ignorant; but I publish it to those who know
it, that ye may perceive that although men have separated us, yet God
having made us companions, we approach the same feast, and worship the
same Lord continually. And we do not keep the festival as observers of
days, knowing that the Apostle reproves those who do so, in those words
which he spake; ‘Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years <span
id="fr_3978"></span>[3979](#fn_3978.md) .’ But rather do we consider the
day solemn because of the feast; so that all of us, who serve God in
every place, may together in our prayers be well-pleasing to God. For
the blessed Paul, announcing the nearness of gladness like this, did not
announce days, but the Lord, for whose sake we keep the feast, saying,
‘Christ, our Passover, is sacrificed <span
id="fr_3979"></span>[3980](#fn_3979.md) ;’ so that we all, contemplating
the eternity of the Word, may draw near to do Him service.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-p9"></span>2. For what else is the feast, but
the service of the soul? And what is that service, but prolonged prayer
to God, and unceasing thanksgiving <span
id="fr_3980"></span>[3981](#fn_3980.md) ? The unthankful departing far from
these are rightly deprived of the joy springing therefrom: for ‘joy and
gladness are taken from their mouth <span
id="fr_3981"></span>[3982](#fn_3981.md) .’ Therefore, the \[divine\] word
doth not allow them to have peace; ‘For there is no peace to the wicked,
saith the Lord <span id="fr_3982"></span>[3983](#fn_3982.md) ,’ they labour
in pain and grief. So, not even to him who owed ten thousand talents did
the Gospel grant forgiveness in the sight of the Lord <span
id="fr_3983"></span>[3984](#fn_3983.md) . For even he, having received
forgiveness of great things, was forgetful of kindness in little ones,
so that he paid the penalty also of those former things. And justly
indeed, for having himself experienced kindness, he was required to be
merciful to his fellow servant. He too that received the one talent, and
bound it up in a napkin, and hid it in the earth, was in consequence
cast out for unthankfulness, hearing the words, ‘Thou wicked and
slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather
where I have not strawed; thou oughtest therefore to have put my money
to the exchangers, and on my return, I should have received mine own.
Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten
talents <span id="fr_3984"></span>[3985](#fn_3984.md) .’ For, of course,
when he was required to deliver up to his lord that which belonged to
him, he should have acknowledged the kindness of him who gave it, and
the value of that which was given. For he who gave was not a hard man,
had he been so, he would not have given even in the first instance;
neither was that which was given unprofitable and vain, for then he had
not found fault. But both he who gave was good, and that which was given
was capable of bearing fruit. As therefore ‘he who withholdeth corn in
seed-time is cursed <span id="fr_3985"></span>[3986](#fn_3985.md) ,’
according to the divine proverb, so he who neglects grace, and hides it
without culture, is properly cast out as a wicked and unthankful person.
On this account, he praises those who increased \[their talents\],
saying, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful
in a little, I will place thee over much; enter into the joy of thy
Lord <span id="fr_3986"></span>[3987](#fn_3986.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-p17"></span>3. This was right and reasonable;
for, as the Scripture declares, they had gained as much as they had
received. Now, my beloved, our will ought to keep pace with the grace of
God, and not fall short; lest while our will remains idle, the grace
given us should begin to depart, and the enemy finding us empty and
naked, should enter \[into us\], as was the case with him spoken of in
the Gospel, from whom the devil went out; ‘for having gone through dry
places, he took seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and
returning and finding the house empty, he dwelt there, and the last
state of that man was worse than the first <span
id="fr_3987"></span>[3988](#fn_3987.md) .’ For the departure from virtue
gives place for the entrance of the unclean spirit. There is, moreover,
the apostolic injunction, that the grace given us should not be
unprofitable; for those things which he wrote particularly to his
disciple, he enforces on us through him <span
id="fr_3988"></span>[3989](#fn_3988.md) , saying, ‘Neglect not the gift
that is in thee. For he who tilleth his land shall be satisfied with
bread; but the paths of the slothful are strewn with thorns;’ so that
the Spirit forewarns a man not to fall into them, saying, ‘Break up your
fallow ground, sow not among thorns <span
id="fr_3989"></span>[3990](#fn_3989.md) .’ For when a man despises the
grace given him; and forth<span id="page_514">p. 514</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-Page_514"></span>with falls into the cares of the
world, he delivers himself over to his lusts; and thus in the time of
persecution he is offended <span id="fr_3990"></span>[3991](#fn_3990.md) ,
and becomes altogether unfruitful. Now the prophet points out the end of
such negligence, saying, ‘Cursed is he who doeth the work of the Lord
carelessly <span id="fr_3991"></span>[3992](#fn_3991.md) .’ For a servant
of the Lord should be diligent and careful, yea, moreover, burning like
a flame, so that when, by an ardent spirit, he has destroyed all carnal
sin, he may be able to draw near to God who, according to the expression
of the saints, is called ‘a consuming fire <span
id="fr_3992"></span>[3993](#fn_3992.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-p24"></span>4. Therefore, the God of all, ‘Who
maketh His angels \[spirits\],’ is a spirit, ‘and His ministers a flame
of fire <span id="fr_3993"></span>[3994](#fn_3993.md) .’ Wherefore, in the
departure from Egypt, He forbade the multitude to touch the mountain,
where God was appointing them the law, because they were not of this
character. But He called blessed Moses to it, as being fervent in
spirit, and possessing unquenchable grace, saying, ‘Let Moses alone draw
near <span id="fr_3994"></span>[3995](#fn_3994.md) .’ He entered into the
cloud also, and when the mountain was smoking, he was not injured; but
rather, through ‘the words of the Lord, which are choice silver purified
in the earth <span id="fr_3995"></span>[3996](#fn_3995.md) ,’ he descended
purified. Therefore the blessed Paul, when desirous that the grace of
the Spirit given to us should not grow cold, exhorts, saying, ‘Quench
not the Spirit <span id="fr_3996"></span>[3997](#fn_3996.md) .’ For so
shall we remain partakers of Christ <span
id="fr_3997"></span>[3998](#fn_3997.md) , if we hold fast to the end the
Spirit given at the beginning. For he said, ‘Quench not;’ not because
the Spirit is placed in the power of men, and is able to suffer anything
from them; but because bad and unthankful men are such as manifestly
wish to quench it, since they, like the impure, persecute the Spirit
with unholy deeds. ‘For the holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit,
nor dwell in a body that is subject unto sin; but will remove from
thoughts that are without understanding <span
id="fr_3998"></span>[3999](#fn_3998.md) .’ Now they being without
understanding, and deceitful, and lovers of sin, walk still as in
darkness, not having that ‘Light which lighteth every man that cometh
into the world <span id="fr_3999"></span>[4000](#fn_3999.md) .’ Now a fire
such as this laid hold of Jeremiah the prophet, when the word was in him
as a fire, and he said, ‘I pass away from every place, and am not able
to endure it <span id="fr_4000"></span>[4001](#fn_4000.md) .’ And our Lord
Jesus Christ, being good and a lover of men, came that He might cast
this upon earth, and said, ‘And what? would that it were already
kindled <span id="fr_4001"></span>[4002](#fn_4001.md) !’ For He desired, as
He testified in Ezekiel <span id="fr_4002"></span>[4003](#fn_4002.md) , the
repentance of a man rather than his death; so that evil should be
entirely consumed in all men, that the soul, being purified, might be
able to bring forth fruit; for the word which is sown by Him will be
productive, some thirty, some sixty, some an hundred <span
id="fr_4003"></span>[4004](#fn_4003.md) . Thus, for instance, those who
were with Cleopas <span id="fr_4004"></span>[4005](#fn_4004.md) , although
infirm at first from lack of knowledge, yet afterwards were inflamed
with the words of the Saviour, and brought forth the fruits of the
knowledge of Him. The blessed Paul also, when seized by this fire,
revealed it not to flesh and blood, but having experienced the grace, he
became a preacher of the Word. But not such were those nine lepers who
were cleansed from their leprosy, and yet were unthankful to the Lord
who healed them; nor Judas, who obtained the lot of an apostle, and was
named a disciple of the Lord, but at last, ‘while eating bread with the
Saviour, lifted up his heel against Him, and became a traitor <span
id="fr_4005"></span>[4006](#fn_4005.md) .’ But such men have the due reward
of their folly, since their expectation will be vain through their
ingratitude; for there is no hope for the ungrateful, the last fire,
prepared for the devil and his angels, awaits those who have neglected
divine light. Such then is the end of the unthankful.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-p38"></span>5. But the faithful and true
servants of the Lord, knowing that the Lord loves the thankful, never
cease to praise Him, ever giving thanks unto the Lord. And whether the
time is one of ease or of affliction, they offer up praise to God with
thanksgiving, not reckoning these things of time, but worshipping the
Lord, the God of times <span id="fr_4006"></span>[4007](#fn_4006.md) . Thus
of old time, Job, who possessed fortitude above all men, thought of
these things when in prosperity; and when in adversity, he patiently
endured, and when he suffered, gave thanks. As also the humble David, in
the very time of affliction sang praises and said, ‘I will bless the
Lord at all times <span id="fr_4007"></span>[4008](#fn_4007.md) .’ And the
blessed Paul, in all his Epistles, so to say, ceased not to thank God.
In times of ease, he failed not, and in afflictions he gloried, knowing
that ‘tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and
experience hope, and that hope maketh not ashamed <span
id="fr_4008"></span>[4009](#fn_4008.md) .’ Let us, being followers of such
men, pass no season without thanksgiving, but especially now, when the
time is one of tribulation, which the heretics excite against us, will
we praise the Lord, uttering the words of the saints; ‘All these <span
id="page_515">p. 515</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-Page_515"></span>things have come upon us, yet have
we not forgotten Thee <span id="fr_4009"></span>[4010](#fn_4009.md) .’ For
as the Jews at that time, although suffering an assault from the
tabernacles <span id="fr_4010"></span>[4011](#fn_4010.md) of the Edomites,
and oppressed by the enemies of Jerusalem, did not give themselves up,
but all the more sang praises to God; so we, my beloved brethren, though
hindered from speaking the word of the Lord, will the more proclaim it,
and being afflicted, we will sing Psalms <span
id="fr_4011"></span>[4012](#fn_4011.md) , in that we are accounted worthy
to be despised, and to labour anxiously for the truth. Yea, moreover,
being grievously vexed, we will give thanks. For the blessed Apostle,
who gave thanks at all times, urges us in the same manner to draw near
to God saying, ‘Let your requests, with thanksgiving, be made known unto
God <span id="fr_4012"></span>[4013](#fn_4012.md) .’ And being desirous
that we should always continue in this resolution, he says, ‘At all
times give thanks; pray without ceasing <span
id="fr_4013"></span>[4014](#fn_4013.md) .’ For he knew that believers are
strong while employed in thanksgiving, and that rejoicing they pass over
the walls of the enemy, like those saints who said, ‘Through Thee will
we pierce through our enemies, and by my God I will leap over a
wall <span id="fr_4014"></span>[4015](#fn_4014.md) .’ At all times let us
stand firm, but especially now, although many afflictions overtake us,
and many heretics are furious against us. Let us then, my beloved
brethren, celebrate with thanksgiving the holy feast which now draws
near to us, ‘girding up the loins of our minds <span
id="fr_4015"></span>[4016](#fn_4015.md) ,’ like our Saviour Jesus Christ,
of Whom it is written, ‘Righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins,
and faithfulness the girdle of His reins <span
id="fr_4016"></span>[4017](#fn_4016.md) .’ Each one of us having in his
hand the staff which came out of the root of Jesse, and our feet shod
with the preparation of the Gospel <span
id="fr_4017"></span>[4018](#fn_4017.md) , let us keep the feast as Paul
saith, ‘Not with the old leaven, but with the unleavened bread of
sincerity and truth <span id="fr_4018"></span>[4019](#fn_4018.md) ;’
reverently trusting that we are reconciled through Christ, and not
departing from faith in Him, nor do we defile ourselves together with
heretics, and strangers to the truth, whose conversation and whose will
degrade them. But rejoicing in afflictions, we break through the furnace
of iron and darkness, and pass, unharmed, over that terrible Red Sea.
Thus also, when we look upon the confusion of heretics, we shall, with
Moses, sing that great song of praise, and say, ‘We will sing unto the
Lord, for He is to be gloriously praised <span
id="fr_4019"></span>[4020](#fn_4019.md) .’ Thus, singing praises, and
seeing that the sin which is in us has been cast into the sea, we pass
over to the wilderness. And being first purified by the fast of forty
days, by prayers, and fastings, and discipline, and good works, we shall
be able to eat the holy Passover in Jerusalem.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-p53"></span>6. The beginning of the fast of
forty days is on the fifth of Phamenoth ([Mar.
1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#000.md)<span
id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-p53.1"></span>); and when, as I have said, we have
first been purified and prepared by those days, we begin the holy week
of the great Easter on the tenth of Pharmuthi (Apr. 5), in which, my
beloved brethren, we should use more prolonged prayers, and fastings,
and watchings, that we may be enabled to anoint our lintels with
precious blood, and to escape the destroyer <span
id="fr_4020"></span>[4021](#fn_4020.md) . Let us rest then, on the
fifteenth of the month Pharmuthi (Apr. 10), for on the evening of that
Saturday we hear the angels’ message, ‘Why seek ye the living among the
dead? He is risen <span id="fr_4021"></span>[4022](#fn_4021.md) .’
Immediately afterwards that great Sunday receives us, I mean on the
sixteenth of the same month Pharmuthi (April 11), on which our Lord
having risen, gave us peace towards our neighbours. When then we have
kept the feast according to His will, let us add from that first day in
the holy week, the seven weeks of Pentecost, and as we then receive the
grace of the Spirit, let us at all times give thanks to the Lord;
through Whom to the Father be glory and dominion, in the Holy Ghost, for
ever and ever. Amen.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-p56"></span>Salute one another with a holy
kiss. The brethren who are with me salute you. I pray, brethren beloved
and longed for, that ye may have health, and that ye may be mindful of
us in the Lord.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.iii-p57"></span>Here endeth the third Festal
Letter of holy Athanasius.
