id="xxiv.ii-p2.1"></span>Letter of Ninety Bishops of Egypt and Libya,
including Athanasius.</span>

<span id="xxiv.ii-p3"></span> ————————————

<span id="xxiv.ii-p4"></span>1. *Pre-Eminence of the Council of Nicæa.
Efforts to exalt that of Ariminum at its expense.*

<span id="xxiv.ii-p5"></span>The letters are sufficient which were
written by our beloved fellow-minister Damasus, bishop of the Great
Rome, and the large number of bishops who assembled along with him; and
equally so are those of the other synods which were held, both in Gaul
and in Italy, concerning the sound Faith which Christ gave us, the
Apostles preached, and the Fathers, who met at Nicæa from all this world
of ours, have handed down. For so great a stir was made at that time
about the Arian heresy, in order that they who had fallen into it might
be reclaimed, while its inventors might be made manifest. To that
council, accordingly, the whole world has long ago agreed, and now, many
synods having been held, all men have been put in mind, both in Dalmatia
and Dardania, Macedonia, Epirus and Greece, Crete, and the other
islands, Sicily, Cyprus, Pamphylia, Lycia, and Isauria, all Egypt and
the Libyas, and most of the Arabians have come to know it, and marvelled
at those who signed it, inasmuch as even if there were left among them
any bitterness springing up from the root of the Arians; we mean
Auxentius, Ursacius, Valens and their fellows, by these letters they
have been cut off and isolated. The confession arrived at at Nicæa was,
we say once more, sufficient and enough by itself, for the subversion of
all irreligious heresy, and for the security and furtherance of the
doctrine of the Church. But since we have heard that certain wishing to
oppose it are attempting to cite a synod supposed to have been held at
Ariminum, and are eagerly striving that it should prevail rather than
the other, we think it right to write and put you in mind, not to endure
anything of the sort: for this is nothing else but a second growth of
the Arian heresy. For what else do they wish for who reject the synod
held against it, namely the Nicene, if not that the cause of Arius
should prevail? What then do such men deserve, but to be called Arians,
and to share the punishment of the Arians? For they were not afraid of
God, who says, ‘Remove not the eternal boundaries which thy fathers
placed <span id="fr_3713"></span>[3714](#fn_3713.md) ,’ and ‘He that
speaketh against father or mother, let him die the death <span
id="fr_3714"></span>[3715](#fn_3714.md) :’ they were not in awe of their
fathers, who enjoined that they who hold the opposite of their
confession should be anathema.

<span id="xxiv.ii-p8"></span>2. *The Synod of Nicæa contrasted with the
local Synods held since.*

<span id="xxiv.ii-p9"></span>For this was why an ecumenical synod has
been held at Nicæa, 318 bishops assembling to discuss the faith on
account of the Arian heresy, namely, in order that local synods should
no more be held on the subject of the Faith, but that, even if held,
they should not hold good. For what does that Council lack, that any one
should seek to innovate? It is full of piety, beloved; and has filled
the whole world with it. Indians have acknowledged it, and all
Christians of other barbarous nations. Vain then is the labour of those
who have often made attempts against it. For already the men we refer to
have held ten or more synods, changing their ground at each, and while
taking away some things from earlier decisions, in later ones make
changes and additions. And so far they have gained nothing by writing,
erasing, and using force, not knowing that ‘every plant that the
Heavenly Father hath not planted shall be plucked up <span
id="fr_3715"></span>[3716](#fn_3715.md) .’ But the word of the Lord which
came through the ecumenical Synod at Nicæa, abides for ever <span
id="fr_3716"></span>[3717](#fn_3716.md) . For if one compare number with
number, these who met at Nicæa are more than those at local synods,
inasmuch as the whole is greater than the part. But if a man wishes to
discern the reason of the Synod at Nicæa, and that of the large number
subsequently held by <span id="page_490">p. 490</span> <span
id="xxiv.ii-Page_490"></span>these men, he will find that while there
was a reasonable cause for the former, the others were got together by
force, by reason of hatred and contention. For the former council was
summoned because of the Arian heresy, and because of Easter, in that
they of Syria, Cilicia and Mesopotamia differed from us, and kept the
feast at the same season as the Jews. But thanks to the Lord, harmony
has resulted not only as to the Faith, but also as to the Sacred Feast.
And that was the reason of the synod at Nicæa. But the subsequent ones
were without number, all however planned in opposition to the
ecumenical.

<span id="xxiv.ii-p12"></span>3. *The true nature of the proceedings at
Ariminum.*

<span id="xxiv.ii-p13"></span>This being pointed out, who will accept
those who cite the synod of Ariminum, or any other, against the Nicene?
or who could help hating men who set at nought their fathers’ decisions,
and put above them the newer ones, drawn up at Ariminum with contention
and violence? or who would wish to agree with these men, who do not
accept even their own? For in their own ten or more synods, as I said
above, they wrote now one thing, now another, and so came out clearly as
themselves the accusers of each one. Their case is not unlike that of
the Jewish traitors in old times. For just as they left the one well of
the living water, and hewed for themselves broken cisterns, which cannot
hold water, as the prophet Jeremiah has it <span
id="fr_3717"></span>[3718](#fn_3717.md) , so these men, fighting against
the one ecumenical synod, ‘hewed for themselves’ many synods, and all
appeared empty, like ‘a sheaf without strength <span
id="fr_3718"></span>[3719](#fn_3718.md) .’ Let us not then tolerate those
who cite the Ariminian or any other synod against that of Nicæa. For
even they who cite that of Ariminum appear not to know what was done
there, for else they would have said nothing about it. For ye know,
beloved, from those who went from you to Ariminum, how Ursacius and
Valens, Eudoxius <span id="fr_3719"></span>[3720](#fn_3719.md) and
Auxentius <span id="fr_3720"></span>[3721](#fn_3720.md) (and there
Demophilus <span id="fr_3721"></span>[3722](#fn_3721.md) also was with
them), were deposed, after wishing to write something to supersede the
Nicene decisions. For on being requested to anathematise the Arian
heresy, they refused, and preferred to be its ringleaders. So the
bishops, like genuine servants of the Lord and orthodox believers (and
there were nearly 200 <span id="fr_3722"></span>[3723](#fn_3722) .md),
wrote that they were satisfied with the Nicene alone, and desired and
held nothing more or less than that. This they also reported to
Constantius, who had ordered the assembling of the synod. But the men
who had been deposed at Ariminum went off to Constantius, and caused
those who had reported against them to be insulted, and threatened with
not being allowed to return to their dioceses, and to be treated with
violence in Thrace that very winter, to compel them to tolerate their
innovations.

<span id="xxiv.ii-p20"></span>4. *The Nicene formula in accordance with
Scripture.*

<span id="xxiv.ii-p21"></span>If then any cite the synod of Ariminum,
firstly let them point out the deposition of the above persons, and what
the bishops wrote, namely that none should seek anything beyond what had
been agreed upon by the fathers at Nicæa, nor cite any synod save that
one. But this they suppress, but make much of what was done by violence
in Thrace <span id="fr_3723"></span>[3724](#fn_3723.md) ; thus shewing that
they are dissemblers of the Arian heresy, and aliens from the sound
Faith. And again, if a man were to examine and compare the great synod
itself, and those held by these people, he would discover the piety of
the one and the folly of the others. They who assembled at Nicæa did so
not after being deposed: and secondly, they confessed that the Son was
of the Essence of the Father. But the others, after being deposed again
and again, and once more at Ariminum itself, ventured to write that it
ought not to be said that the Son had Essence or Subsistence. This
enables us to see, brethren, that they of Nicæa breathe the spirit of
Scripture, in that God says in Exodus <span
id="fr_3724"></span>[3725](#fn_3724.md) , ‘I am that I am,’ and through
Jeremiah, ‘Who is in His substance <span
id="fr_3725"></span>[3726](#fn_3725.md) and hath seen His word;’ and just
below, ‘if they had stood in My subsistence <span
id="fr_3726"></span>[3727](#fn_3726.md) and heard My words:’ now
subsistence is essence, and means nothing else but very being, which
Jeremiah calls existence, in the words, ‘and they heard not the voice of
existence <span id="fr_3727"></span>[3728](#fn_3727.md) .’ For subsistence,
and essence, is existence: for it is, or in other words exists. This
Paul also perceiving wrote to the Hebrews, ‘who being the brightness of
his glory, and the express Image of his subsistence <span
id="fr_3728"></span>[3729](#fn_3728.md) .’ But the others, who think they
know the Scriptures and call themselves wise, and do not choose to speak
of subsistence in God (for thus they wrote at Ariminum and at other
synods of theirs), were surely with justice deposed, saying as they did,
<span id="page_491">p. 491</span> <span
id="xxiv.ii-Page_491"></span>like the fool did in his heart <span
id="fr_3729"></span>[3730](#fn_3729.md) , ‘God is not.’ And again the
fathers taught at Nicæa that the Son and Word is not a creature, nor
made, having read ‘all things were made through Him <span
id="fr_3730"></span>[3731](#fn_3730.md) ,’ and ‘in Him were all things
created, and consist <span id="fr_3731"></span>[3732](#fn_3731.md) ;’ while
these men, Arians rather than Christians, in their other synods have
ventured to call Him a creature, and one of the things that are made,
things of which He Himself is the Artificer and Maker. For if ‘through
Him all things were made’ and He too is a creature, He would be the
creator of Himself. And how can what is being created create? or He that
is creating be created?

<span id="xxiv.ii-p31"></span>5. *How the test ‘Coessential’ came to be
adopted at Nicæa.*

<span id="xxiv.ii-p32"></span>But not even thus are they ashamed,
although they say such things as cause them to be hated by all; citing
the Synod of Ariminum, only to shew that there also they were deposed.
And as to the actual definition of Nicæa, that the Son is coessential
with the Father, on account of which they ostensibly oppose the synod,
and buzz around everywhere like gnats about the phrase, either they
stumble at it from ignorance, like those who stumble at the stone of
stumbling that was laid in Sion <span
id="fr_3732"></span>[3733](#fn_3732.md) ; or else they know, but for that
very reason are constantly opposing and murmuring, because it is an
accurate declaration and full in the face of their heresy. For it is not
the phrases that vex them, but the condemnation of themselves which the
definition contains. And of this, once again, they are themselves the
cause, even if they wish to conceal the fact of which they are perfectly
aware,—But we must now mention it, in order that hence also the accuracy
of the great synod may be shewn. For <span
id="fr_3733"></span>[3734](#fn_3733.md) the assembled bishops wished to put
away the impious phrases devised by the Arians, namely ‘made of
nothing,’ and that the Son was ‘a thing made,’ and a ‘creature,’ and
that ‘there was a time when He was not,’ and that ‘He is of mutable
nature.’ And they wished to set down in writing the acknowledged
language of Scripture, namely that the Word is of God by nature
Only-begotten, Power, Wisdom of the Father, Very God, as John says, and
as Paul wrote, brightness of the Father’s glory and express image of His
person <span id="fr_3734"></span>[3735](#fn_3734.md) . But Eusebius and his
fellows, drawn on by their own error, kept conferring together as
follows: ‘Let us assent. For we also are of God: for “there is one God
of whom are all things <span id="fr_3735"></span>[3736](#fn_3735.md) ,” and
“old things are passed away, behold all things are made new, but all
things are of God <span id="fr_3736"></span>[3737](#fn_3736.md) .”’ And
they considered what is written in the Shepherd <span
id="fr_3737"></span>[3738](#fn_3737.md) , ‘Before all things believe that
God is one, who created and set all things in order, and made them to
exist out of nothing.’ But the Bishops, beholding their craftiness, and
the cunning of their impiety, expressed more plainly the sense of the
words ‘of God,’ by writing that the Son is of the Essence of God, so
that whereas the Creatures, since they do not exist of themselves
without a cause, but have a beginning of their existence, are said to be
‘of God,’ the Son alone might be deemed proper to the Essence of the
Father. For this is peculiar to one who is Only-begotten and true Word
in relation to a Father, and this was the reason why the words ‘of the
essence’ were adopted. Again <span id="fr_3738"></span>[3739](#fn_3738.md)
, upon the bishops asking the dissembling minority if they agreed that
the Son was not a Creature, but the Power and only Wisdom of the Father,
and the Eternal Image, in all respects exact, of the Father, and true
God, Eusebius and his fellows were observed exchanging nods with one
another, as much as to say ‘this applies to us men also, for we too are
called “the image and glory of God <span
id="fr_3739"></span>[3740](#fn_3739.md) ,” and of us it is said, “For we
which live are alway <span id="fr_3740"></span>[3741](#fn_3740.md) ,” and
there are many Powers, and “all the power <span
id="fr_3741"></span>[3742](#fn_3741.md) of the Lord went out of the land of
Egypt,” while the caterpillar and the locust are called His “great
power <span id="fr_3742"></span>[3743](#fn_3742.md) .” And “the Lord of
powers <span id="fr_3743"></span>[3744](#fn_3743.md) is with us, the God of
Jacob is our help.” For we hold that we are proper <span
id="fr_3744"></span>[3745](#fn_3744.md) to God, and not merely so, but
insomuch that He has even called us brethren. Nor does it vex us, even
if they call the Son Very God. For when made He exists in verity.’

<span id="xxiv.ii-p46"></span>6. *The Nicene test not unscriptural in
sense, nor a novelty.*

<span id="xxiv.ii-p47"></span>Such was the corrupt mind of the Arians.
But here too the Bishops, beholding their craftiness, collected from the
Scriptures the figures of brightness, of the river and the well, and of
the relation of the express Image to the Subsistence, and the texts, ‘in
thy light shall we see light <span id="fr_3745"></span>[3746](#fn_3745.md)
,’ and ‘I and the Father are one <span
id="fr_3746"></span>[3747](#fn_3746.md) .’ And lastly they wrote more
plainly, and concisely, that the Son was coessential with the Father;
for all the above passages signify this. And their murmuring, that the
phrases are unscriptural, is exposed as vain by themselves, for they
have uttered their impieties in unscriptural terms: (for such are ‘of
<span id="page_492">p. 492</span> <span
id="xxiv.ii-Page_492"></span>nothing’ and ‘there was a time when He was
not’), while yet they find fault because they were condemned by
unscriptural terms pious in meaning. While they, like men sprung from a
dunghill, verily ‘spoke of the earth <span
id="fr_3747"></span>[3748](#fn_3747.md) ,’ the Bishops, not having invented
their phrases for themselves, but having testimony from their Fathers,
wrote as they did. For ancient bishops, of the Great Rome and of our
city, some 130 years ago, wrote <span
id="fr_3748"></span>[3749](#fn_3748.md) and censured those who said that
the Son was a creature and not coessential with the Father. And Eusebius
knew this, who was bishop of Cæsarea, and at first an accomplice <span
id="fr_3749"></span>[3750](#fn_3749.md) of the Arian heresy; but
afterwards, having signed at the Council of Nicæa, wrote to his own
people affirming as follows: ‘we know that certain eloquent and
distinguished bishops and writers even of ancient date used the word
“coessential” with reference to the Godhead of the Father and the Son.’

<span id="xxiv.ii-p53"></span>7. *The position that the Son is a
Creature inconsistent and untenable.*

<span id="xxiv.ii-p54"></span>Why then do they go on citing the Synod of
Ariminum, at which they were deposed? Why do they reject that of Nicæa,
at which their Fathers signed the confession that the Son is of the
Father’s Essence and coessential with Him? Why do they run about? For
now they are at war not only with the bishops who met at Nicæa, but with
their own great bishops and their own friends. Whose heirs or successors
then are they? How can they call men fathers, whose confession, well and
apostolically drawn up, they will not accept? For if they think they can
object to it, let them speak, or rather answer, that they may be
convicted of falling foul of themselves, whether they believe the Son
when He says, ‘I and my Father are one,’ and ‘he that hath seen Me hath
seen the Father <span id="fr_3750"></span>[3751](#fn_3750.md) .’ ‘Yes,’
they must answer, ‘since it is written we believe it.’ But if they are
asked how they are one, and how he that hath seen the Son hath seen the
Father, of course, we suppose they will say, ‘by reason of resemblance,’
unless they have quite come to agree with those who hold the
brother-opinion to theirs, and are called <span
id="fr_3751"></span>[3752](#fn_3751.md) Anomœans. But if once more they are
asked, ‘how is He like?’ they brasen it out and say, ‘by perfect virtue
and harmony, by having the same will with the Father, by not willing
what the Father wills not.’ But let them understand that one assimilated
to God by virtue and will is liable also to the purpose of changing; but
the Word is not thus, unless He is ‘like’ in part, and as we are,
because He is not like \[God\] in essence also. But these
characteristics belong to us, who are originate, and of a created
nature. For we too, albeit we cannot become like God in essence, yet by
progress in virtue imitate God, the Lord granting us this grace, in the
words, ‘Be ye merciful as your Father is merciful:’ ‘be ye perfect as
your heavenly Father is perfect <span
id="fr_3752"></span>[3753](#fn_3752.md) .’ But that originate things are
changeable, no one can deny, seeing that angels transgressed, Adam
disobeyed, and all stand in need of the grace of the Word. But a mutable
thing cannot be like God who is truly unchangeable, any more than what
is created can be like its creator. This is why, with regard to us, the
holy man said, ‘Lord, who shall be likened unto thee <span
id="fr_3753"></span>[3754](#fn_3753.md) ,’ and ‘who among the gods is like
unto thee, Lord <span id="fr_3754"></span>[3755](#fn_3754.md) ;’ meaning by
gods those who, while created, had yet become partakers of the Word, as
He Himself said, ‘If he called them gods to whom the word of God
came <span id="fr_3755"></span>[3756](#fn_3755.md) .’ But things which
partake cannot be identical with or similar to that whereof they
partake. For example, He said of Himself, ‘I and the Father are
one <span id="fr_3756"></span>[3757](#fn_3756.md) ,’ implying that things
originate are not so. For we would ask those who allege the Ariminian
Synod, whether a created essence can say, ‘what things I see my Father
make, those I make also <span id="fr_3757"></span>[3758](#fn_3757.md) .’
For things originate are made and do not make; or else they made even
themselves. Why, if, as they say, the Son is a Creature and the Father
is His Maker, surely the Son would be His own maker, as He is able to
make what the Father makes, as He said. But such a supposition is absurd
and utterly untenable, for none can make himself.

<span id="xxiv.ii-p63"></span>8. *The Son’s relation to the Father
essential, not merely ethical.*

<span id="xxiv.ii-p64"></span>Once more, let them say whether things
originate could say <span id="fr_3758"></span>[3759](#fn_3758.md) , ‘all
things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine.’ Now, He has the prerogative
of creating and making, of Eternity, of omnipotence, of immutability.
But things originate cannot have the power of making, for they are
creatures; nor eternity, for their existence has a beginning; nor of
omnipotence and immutability, for they are under sway, and of changeable
nature, as the Scriptures say. Well then, if these prerogatives belong
to the Son, they clearly do so, not on account of His virtue, as said
above, but essentially, even as <span id="page_493">p. 493</span> <span
id="xxiv.ii-Page_493"></span>the synod said, ‘He is of no other essence’
but of the Father’s, to whom these prerogatives are proper. But what can
that be which is proper to the Father’s essence, and an offspring from
it, or what name can we give it, save ‘coessential?’ For that which a
man sees in the Father, that sees he also in the Son; and that not by
participation, but essentially. And this is \[the meaning of\] ‘I and
the Father are one,’ and ‘he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.’
Here especially once more it is easy to shew their folly. If it is from
virtue, the antecedent of willing and not willing, and of moral
progress, that you hold the Son to be like the Father; while these
things fall under the category of quality; clearly you call God compound
of quality and essence. But who will tolerate you when you say this? For
God, who compounded all things to give them being, is not compound, nor
of similar nature to the things made by Him through the Word. Far be the
thought. For He is simple essence, in which quality is not, nor, as
James says, ‘any variableness or shadow of turning <span
id="fr_3759"></span>[3760](#fn_3759.md) .’ Accordingly, if it is shewn that
it is not from virtue (for in God there is no quality, neither is there
in the Son), then He must be proper to God’s essence. And this you will
certainly admit if mental apprehension is not utterly destroyed in you.
But what is that which is proper to and identical with the essence of
God, and an Offspring from it by nature, if not by this very fact
coessential with Him that begat it? For this is the distinctive relation
of a Son to a Father, and he who denies this, does not hold that the
Word is Son in nature and in truth.

<span id="xxiv.ii-p67"></span>9. *The honest repudiation of Arianism
involves the acceptance of the Nicene test.*

<span id="xxiv.ii-p68"></span>This then the Fathers perceived when they
wrote that the Son was coessential with the Father, and anathematised
those who say that the Son is of a different Subsistence <span
id="fr_3760"></span>[3761](#fn_3760.md) : not inventing phrases for
themselves, but learning in their turn, as we said, from the Fathers who
had been before them. But after the above proof, their Ariminian Synod
is superfluous, as well as any <span
id="fr_3761"></span>[3762](#fn_3761.md) other synod cited by them as
touching the Faith. For that of Nicæa is sufficient, agreeing as it does
with the ancient bishops also, in which too their fathers signed, whom
they ought to respect, on pain of being thought anything but Christians.
But if even after such proofs, and after the testimony of the ancient
bishops, and the signature of their own Fathers, they pretend as if in
ignorance to be alarmed at the phrase ‘coessential,’ then let them say
and hold, in simpler terms and truly, that the Son is Son by nature, and
anathematise as the synod enjoined those who say that the Son of God is
a Creature or a thing made, or of nothing, or that there was once a time
when He was not, and that He is mutable and liable to change, and of
another Subsistence. And so let them escape the Arian heresy. And we are
confident that in sincerely anathematising these views, they *ipso
facto* confess that the Son is of the Father’s Essence, and coessential
with Him. For this is why the Fathers, having said that the Son was
coessential, straightway added, ‘but those who say that He is a
creature, or made, or of nothing, or that there was once a time when He
was not,’ the Catholic Church anathematises: namely in order that by
this means they might make it known that these things are meant by the
word ‘coessential.’ And the meaning ‘Coessential’ is known from the Son
not being a Creature or thing made: and because he that says
‘coessential’ does not hold that the Word is a Creature: and he that
anathematises the above views, at the same time holds that the Son is
coessential with the Father; and he that calls Him ‘coessential,’ calls
the Son of God genuinely and truly so; and he that calls Him genuinely
Son understands the texts, ‘I and the Father are one,’ and ‘he that hath
seen Me hath seen the Father <span id="fr_3762"></span>[3763](#fn_3762.md)
.’

<span id="xxiv.ii-p72"></span>10. *Purpose of this Letter; warning
against Auxentius of Milan.*

<span id="xxiv.ii-p73"></span>Now it would be proper to write this at
greater length. But since we write to you who know, we have dictated it
concisely, praying that among all the bond of peace might be preserved,
and that all in the Catholic Church should say and hold the same thing.
And we are not meaning to teach, but to put you in mind. Nor is it only
ourselves that write, but all the bishops of Egypt and the Libyas, some
ninety in number. For we all are of one mind in this, and we always sign
for one another if any chance not to be present. Such being our state of
mind, since we happened to be assembled, we wrote, both to our beloved
Damasus, bishop of the Great Rome, giving an account of Auxentius <span
id="fr_3763"></span>[3764](#fn_3763.md) who has in<span id="page_494">p.
494</span> <span id="xxiv.ii-Page_494"></span>truded upon the church at
Milan; namely that he not only shares the Arian heresy, but is also
accused of many offences, which he committed with Gregory <span
id="fr_3764"></span>[3765](#fn_3764.md) , the sharer of his impiety; and
while expressing our surprise that so far he has not been deposed and
expelled from the Church, we thanked \[Damasus\] for his piety and that
of those who assembled at the Great Rome, in that by expelling Ursacius
and Valens, and those who hold with them, they preserved the harmony of
the Catholic Church. Which we pray may be preserved also among you, and
therefore entreat you not to tolerate, as we said above, those who put
forward a host of synods held concerning the Faith, at Ariminum, at
Sirmium, in Isauria, in Thrace, those in Constantinople, and the many
irregular ones in Antioch. But let the Faith confessed by the Fathers at
Nicæa alone hold good among you, at which all the fathers, including
those of the men who now are fighting against it, were present, as we
said above, and signed: in order that of us too the Apostle may say,
‘Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and as I handed the
traditions to you, so ye hold them fast <span
id="fr_3765"></span>[3766](#fn_3765.md) .’

<span id="xxiv.ii-p77"></span>11. *Godhead of the Spirit also involved
in the Nicene Creed.*

<span id="xxiv.ii-p78"></span>For this Synod of Nicæa is in truth a
proscription of every heresy. It also upsets those who blaspheme the
Holy Spirit, and call Him a Creature. For the Fathers, after speaking of
the faith in the Son, straightway added, ‘And we believe in the Holy
Ghost,’ in order that by confessing perfectly and fully the faith in the
Holy Trinity they might make known the exact form of the Faith of
Christ, and the teaching of the Catholic Church. For it is made clear
both among you and among all, and no Christian can have a doubtful mind
on the point, that our faith is not in the Creature, but in one God,
Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible: and in one
Lord Jesus Christ His Only-begotten Son, and in one Holy Ghost; one God,
known in the holy and perfect Trinity, baptized into which, and in it
united to the Deity, we believe that we have also inherited the kingdom
of the heavens, in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom to the Father be
the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.

<span id="xxiv.ii-p74"></span> Auxentius (not in D.C.B.) was a native of
Cappadocia (*Hist. Ar.* 75), and had been ordained presbyter at
Alexandria by Gregory (next note). Upon the expulsion of the somewhat
weak-kneed Dionysius after the council at Milan (355) he was appointed
to that see by Constantius, although according to Athanasius (*ubi
supr.*) he knew no Latin, nor any thing else except irreligion (‘a
busybody rather than a Christian’). He took a leading part along with
Valens and others at the Council of Ariminum (*de Syn.* 8, 10) and was
included in the deposition of Arian leaders by that synod. Under the
orthodox Valentinian he maintained his see in spite of the efforts of
Philaster, Evagrius, and Eusebius of Vercellæ, and in spite of the
condemnations passed upon him by various Western synods (362–371, see
*ad Epict.* 1). In 364, Hilary travelled to Milan on purpose to expose
him before Valentinian. In a discussion ordered by the latter, Hilary
extorted from Auxentius a confession which satisfied the Emperor, but
not Hilary himself, whose persistent denunciation of its insincerity
caused his dismissal from the town. Auxentius seems after this to have
intrigued to obtain Illyrian signatures to the creed of ( Niké or)
Ariminum (Hard. *Conc.* 1. pp. 771, 773). Upon his death (374) Ambrose
was elected bishop of Milan, but was confronted by the Arian party with
a rival bishop in the person of a second Auxentius, said to have been a
pupil of Ulfilas.
