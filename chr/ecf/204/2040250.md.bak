<span id="xvi.ii.xxxix-p1"></span> 86. And a certain general, Balacius
by name, persecuted us Christians bitterly on account of his regard for
the Arians—that name of ill-omen. And as his ruthlessness was so great
that he beat virgins, and stripped and scourged monks, Antony at this
time wrote a letter as follows, and sent it to him. ‘I see wrath coming
upon thee, wherefore cease to persecute the Christians, lest haply wrath
catch hold of thee, for even now it is on the point of coming upon
thee <span id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138.md) .’ But Balacius laughed
and threw the letter on the ground, and spit on it, and insulted the
bearers, bidding them tell this to Antony: ‘Since thou takest thought
for the monks, soon I will come after thee also.’ And five days had not
passed before wrath came upon him. For Balacius and Nestorius, the
Prefect of Egypt <span id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139.md) , went forth
to the first halting-place from Alexandria, which is called Chæreu, and
both were on horseback, and the horses belonged to Balacius, and were
the quietest of all his stable. But they had not gone far towards the
place when the horses began to frisk with one another as they are wont
to do; and suddenly the quieter, on which Nestorius sat <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140.md) , with a bite dismounted Balacius,
and attacked him, and tore his thigh so badly with its teeth that he was
borne straight back to the city, and in three days died. And all
wondered because what Antony had foretold had been so speedily
fulfilled.

id="xvi.ii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxix-p2"></span> In *Hist. Ar.* 14 the letter is sent
not to Balacius but to Gregory, who died on June 26, 345 (Gwatkin, p.
105).

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxix-p3"></span> Nestorius was prefect ‘345–352’
(Index to Fest. Letters, where the year ‘345’ is from August 344 to
August 345).

<span id="fn_1140"></span>[219:1141](2040250.htm#fr_1140.md) <span
id="xvi.ii.xxxix-p3.2"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxix-p4"></span> In the *Hist. Ar.* it is simply
stated that Balacius was bitten by *his own* horse. The present passage
looks like a more careful restatement.
