<span id="xi.ii.v-p1"></span> §5. *The same text further explained.*

<span id="xi.ii.v-p2"></span>For His Only-begotten Son might, ye Arians,
be called ‘Father’ by His Father, yet not in the sense in which you in
your error might perhaps understand it, but (while Son of the Father
that begat Him) ‘Father of the coming age’ ([Isa. ix.
6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md)<span id="xi.ii.v-p2.1"></span>,
LXX). For it is necessary not to leave any of your surmises open to you.
Well then, He says by the prophet, ‘A Son is born and given to us, whose
government is upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Angel of
Great Counsel, mighty God, Ruler, Father of the coming age’ ([Isa. ix.
6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)<span id="xi.ii.v-p2.2"></span>.md). The
Only-begotten Son of God, then, is at once Father of the coming age, and
mighty God, and Ruler. And it is shewn clearly that all things
whatsoever the Father hath are His, and that as the Father gives life,
the Son likewise is able to quicken whom He will. For ‘the dead,’ He
says, ‘shall hear the voice of the Son, and shall live’ (cf. [John v.
25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025)<span id="xi.ii.v-p2.3"></span>.md),
and the will and desire of Father and Son is one, since their nature
also is one and indivisible. And the Arians torture themselves to no
purpose, from not understanding the saying of our Saviour, ‘All things
whatsoever the Father hath are Mine.’ For from this passage at once the
delusion of Sabellius can be upset, and it will expose the folly of our
modern Jews. For this is why the Only begotten, having life in Himself
as the Father has, also knows alone Who the Father is, namely, because
He is in the Father and the Father in Him. For He is His Image, and
consequently, because He is His Image, all that belongs to the Father is
in Him. He is an exact seal, shewing in Himself the Father; living Word
and true, Power, Wisdom, our Sanctification and Redemption ([1 Cor. i.
30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030)<span id="xi.ii.v-p2.4"></span>.md).
For ‘in Him we both live and move and have <span id="page_90">p.
90</span> <span id="xi.ii.v-Page_90"></span>our being’ ([Acts xvii.
28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028)<span id="xi.ii.v-p2.5"></span>.md),
and ‘no man knoweth Who is the Father, save the Son, and Who is the Son,
save the Father’ ([Luke x. 22](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#022.md)<span
id="xi.ii.v-p2.6"></span>).
