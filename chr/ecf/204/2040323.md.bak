<span id="xix.ii.xx-p1"></span> 20. *Same Subject Continued.*

<span id="xix.ii.xx-p2"></span>Thus, for example, the Patriarch Jacob
was favoured in his flight with many, even divine visions, and remaining
quiet himself, he had the Lord on his side, rebuking Laban, and
hindering the designs of Esau; and afterwards he became the Father of
Judah, of whom sprang the Lord according to the flesh; and he dispensed
the blessings to the Patriarchs. And when Moses the beloved of God was
in exile, then it was that he saw that great sight, and being preserved
from his persecutors, was sent as a prophet into Egypt, and being made
the minister of those mighty wonders and of the Law, he led that great
people in the wilderness. And David when he was persecuted wrote the
Psalm, ‘My heart uttered a good word <span
id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477.md) ;’ and, ‘Our God shall come even
visibly, and shall not keep silence <span
id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478.md) .’ And again he speaks more
confidently, saying, ‘Mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine
enemies <span id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479.md) ;’ and again, ‘In God
have I put my trust; I will not be afraid what man can do unto me <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480.md) .’ And when he fled and escaped
from the face of Saul ‘to the cave,’ he said, ‘He hath sent from heaven
and hath saved me. He hath given them to reproach that would tread me
under their feet. God hath sent His mercy and truth, and hath delivered
my soul from the midst of lions <span
id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481.md) .’ Thus he too was saved according
to the dispensation of God, and afterwards became king, and received the
promise, that from his seed our Lord should issue. And the great Elijah,
when he withdrew to mount Carmel, called upon God, and destroyed at once
more than four hundred prophets of Baal; and when there were sent to
take him two captains of fifty with their hundred men, he said, ‘Let
fire come down from heaven <span id="fr_1482"></span>[1483](#fn_1482.md) ,’
and thus rebuked them. And he too was preserved, so that he anointed
Elisha in his own stead, and became a pattern of discipline for the sons
of the prophets. And the blessed Paul, after writing these words, ‘what
persecutions I endured; but out of them all the Lord delivered me, and
will deliver <span id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483.md) ;’ could speak
more confidently and say, ‘But in all these things we are more than
conquerors, for nothing shall separate us from the love of Christ <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484.md) .’ For then it was that he was
caught up to the third heaven, and admitted into paradise, where he
heard ‘unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to
utter <span id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485.md) .’ And for this end was
he then preserved, that ‘from Jerusalem even unto Illyricum’ he might
‘fully preach the Gospel <span id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) .’
