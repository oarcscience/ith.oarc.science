<span id="v.i.v"></span>

<span id="v.i.v-p1"></span> §5. <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.v-p1.1"></span>History of Doctrine</span>. For ancient sources
see articles <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.v-p1.2"></span>Heresiology</span> and <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.v-p1.3"></span>Person of Christ</span> in D.C.B., vols. iii.,
iv. The modern classics are the works of <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.v-p1.4"></span>Petavius</span>, *de Trinitate* (in vols. ii. and
iii. of his *De dogmat. Theol*.) of <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.v-p1.5"></span>Thomassinus</span>, *Dogmata Theologica*, and of
<span class="c10"><span id="v.i.v-p1.6"></span>Bull</span>, *Defensio
fidei Nicænæ* (maintaining against Petav. the fixity of pre-Nicene
doctrine). Under this head we include <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.v-p1.7"></span>Newman’s</span> *Arians of the Fourth Century*,
an English classic, unrivalled as a dogmatic and religious study of
Arianism, although unsatisfactory on its purely historical side.
(Obsolete chronology retained in all editions.) The general histories of
Doctrine are of course full on the subject of Arianism; for an
enumeration of them, see Harnack, §2 of his Prolegomena. In English we
have <span class="c10"><span id="v.i.v-p1.8"></span>Shedd</span> (N.Y.,
1863, Edinb., 1884), <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.v-p1.9"></span>Hagenbach</span> (Clark’s *Foreign Theol. Lib*.),
and the great work of <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.v-p1.10"></span>Dorner</span> (id.). The most important recent
works are those of <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.v-p1.11"></span>Harnack</span>, *Dogmengeschichte* (1886, third
vol., 1890), a most able work and (allowing for the prepossessions of
the Ritschl school) impartial and philosophical; and <span
class="c10"><span id="v.i.v-p1.12"></span>Loofs</span>, *Leitfaden zur
Dogmengeschichte* (2 ed., 1890), on similar lines, but studiously
temperate and fair. Both works are much used in this volume (quoted
commonly as ‘Harnack,’ ‘Loofs,’ simply. Harnack, vol. i., is quoted from
the *first* edition, but the later editions give comparative tables of
the pages). For *Councils and Creeds*, in addition to the works of
Hefele and Bright mentioned §4 c., see <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.v-p1.13"></span>Heurtley</span> *Harmonia Symbolica*; <span
class="c10"><span id="v.i.v-p1.14"></span>Hahn</span>, *Bibliothek der
Symbole*; <span class="c10"><span id="v.i.v-p1.15"></span>Hort</span>,
*Two Dissertations* (1876), indispensable for history of the Nicene
Creed; <span class="c10"><span id="v.i.v-p1.16"></span>Swainson</span>,
*Nicene and Apostles’ Creed*, 1875; <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.v-p1.17"></span>Caspari</span>, *Ungedruckte u.s.w. Quellen zum
Taufsymbol u.s.w*. (3 vols. in 2, Christiania, 1866–1875), and *Alte und
Neue Quellen*, ib. 1879; one of the most important of modern patristic
works.
