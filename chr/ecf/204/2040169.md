<span id="xi.ii.ii-p1"></span> §2. *Sense in which, and end for which
all things were delivered to the Incarnate Son.*

<span id="xi.ii.ii-p2"></span>For whereas man sinned, and is fallen, and
by his fall all things are in confusion: death prevailed from Adam to
Moses (cf. [Rom. v. 14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014)<span
id="xi.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>), the earth was cursed, Hades was opened,
Paradise shut, Heaven offended, man, lastly, corrupted and brutalised
(cf. [Ps. xlix. 12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012)<span
id="xi.ii.ii-p2.2"></span>), while the devil was exulting against
us;—then God, in His loving-kindness, not willing man made in His own
image to perish, said, ‘Whom shall I send, and who will go?’ ([Isa. vi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#008)<span id="xi.ii.ii-p2.3"></span>).
But while all held their peace, the Son <span
id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440) said, ‘Here am I, send Me.’ And then
it was that, saying ‘Go Thou,’ He ‘delivered’ to Him man, that the Word
Himself might be made Flesh, and by taking the Flesh, restore it wholly.
For to Him, as to a physician, man ‘was delivered’ to heal the bite of
the serpent; as to life, to raise what was dead; as to light, to
illumine the darkness; and, because He was Word, to renew the rational
nature (<span class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.ii-p3.2"></span>τὸ
λογικόν</span>). Since then all things ‘were delivered’ to Him, and He
is made Man, straightway all things were set right and perfected. Earth
receives <span id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span
id="xi.ii.ii-Page_88"></span>blessing instead of a curse, Paradise was
opened to the robber, Hades cowered, the tombs were opened and the dead
raised, the gates of Heaven were lifted up to await Him that ‘cometh
from Edom’ ([Ps. 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007), [Isa.
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001)<span id="xi.ii.ii-p3.3"></span>).
Why, the Saviour Himself expressly signifies in what sense ‘all things
were delivered’ to Him, when He continues, as Matthew tells us: ‘Come
unto Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest’ ([Matt. xi. 28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028)<span
id="xi.ii.ii-p3.4"></span>). Yes, ye ‘were delivered’ to Me to give rest
to those who had laboured, and life to the dead. And what is written in
John’s Gospel harmonises with this: ‘The Father loveth the Son, and hath
given all things into His hand’ ([Joh. iii.
35](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#035)<span id="xi.ii.ii-p3.5"></span>).
Given, in order that, just as all things were made by Him, so in Him all
things might be renewed. For they were not ‘delivered’ unto Him, that
being poor, He might be made rich, nor did He receive all things that He
might receive power which before He lacked: far be the thought: but in
order that as Saviour He might rather set all things right. For it was
fitting that while ‘through Him’ all things came into being at the
beginning, ‘in Him’ (note the change of phrase) all things should be set
right (cf. [John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003), [Eph.
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010)<span id="xi.ii.ii-p3.6"></span>).
For at the beginning they came into being ‘through’ Him; but afterwards,
all having fallen, the Word has been made Flesh, and put it on, in order
that ‘in Him’ all should be set right. Suffering Himself, He gave us
rest, hungering Himself, He nourished us, and going down into Hades He
brought us back thence. For example, at the time of the creation of all
things, their creation consisted in a fiat, such as ‘let \[the earth\]
bring forth,’ ‘let there be’ ([Gen.
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#011)<span id="xi.ii.ii-p3.7"></span>),
but at the restoration it was fitting that all things should be
‘delivered’ to Him, in order that He might be made man, and all things
be renewed in Him. For man, being in Him, was quickened: for this was
why the Word was united to man, namely, that against man the curse might
no longer prevail. This is the reason why they record the request made
on behalf of mankind in the seventy-first Psalm: ‘Give the King Thy
judgment, O God’ ([Ps. lxxii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)<span
id="xi.ii.ii-p3.8"></span>): asking that both the judgment of death
which hung over us may be delivered to the Son, and that He may then, by
dying for us, abolish it for us in Himself. This was what He signified,
saying Himself, in the eighty-seventh Psalm: ‘Thine indignation lieth
hard upon me’ ([Ps. lxxxviii. 7](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#007)<span
id="xi.ii.ii-p3.9"></span>). For He bore the indignation which lay upon
us, as also He says in the hundred and thirty-seventh: ‘Lord, Thou shalt
do vengeance for me’ ([Ps. cxxxviii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#008)<span id="xi.ii.ii-p3.10"></span>,
LXX.).

id="xi.ii.ii-p2.4"></span>

<span id="xi.ii.ii-p3"></span> This dramatic representation of the
Mission of the Son stands alone in the writings of Athanasius, and, if
pressed, lends itself to a conception of the relation of the Son to the
Father which, if not Arian, is at least contrary to the more explicit
and mature conception of Athanasius as formulated for example in *Orat.*
ii. 31 (and see note 7 there). The same idea appears in Milton’s
Paradise Lost (e.g. Book X.). See Newman, *Arians* 4, p. 93, note.
