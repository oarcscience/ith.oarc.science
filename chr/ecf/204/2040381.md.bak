<span id="xxi.ii.vi.i-p3"></span>§§1–5. *The substantiality of the Word
proved from Scripture. If the One Origin be substantial, Its Word is
substantial. Unless the Word and Son be a second Origin, or a work, or
an attribute (and so God be compounded), or at the same time Father, or
involve a second nature in God, He is from the Father’s Essence and
distinct from Him. Illustration of* <span
id="xxi.ii.vi.i-p3.1"></span>*[John x.
30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md)<span id="xxi.ii.vi.i-p3.2"></span>,
drawn from* <span id="xxi.ii.vi.i-p3.3"></span>*[Deut. iv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#004.md)<span id="xxi.ii.vi.i-p3.4"></span>*.

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.i-p4"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.vi.i-p4.1"></span>The</span> Word is God from God; for ‘the
Word was God <span id="fr_3274"></span>[3275](#fn_3274.md) ,’ and again,
‘Of whom are the Fathers, and of whom Christ, who is God over all,
blessed for ever. Amen <span id="fr_3275"></span>[3276](#fn_3275.md) .’ And
since Christ is God from God, and God’s Word, Wisdom, Son, and Power,
therefore but One God is declared in the divine Scriptures. For the
Word, being Son of the One God, is referred to Him of whom also He is;
so that Father and Son are two, yet the Monad of the Godhead is
indivisible and inseparable. And thus too we preserve One Beginning of
Godhead and not two Beginnings, whence there is strictly a Monarchy. And
of this very Beginning the Word is by nature Son, not as if another
beginning, subsisting by Himself, nor having come into being externally
to that Beginning, lest from that diversity a Dyarchy and Polyarchy
should ensue; but of the one Beginning He is own Son, own Wisdom, own
Word, existing from It. For, according to John, ‘in’ that ‘Beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God,’ for the Beginning was God; and
since He is from It, therefore also ‘the Word was God.’ And as there is
one Beginning and therefore one God, so one is that Essence and
Subsistence which indeed and truly and really is, and which said ‘I am
that I am <span id="fr_3276"></span>[3277](#fn_3276.md) ,’ and not two,
that there be not two Beginnings; and from the One, a Son in nature and
truth, is Its own Word, Its Wisdom, Its Power, and inseparable from It.
And as there is not another essence, lest there be two Beginnings, so
the Word which is from that One Essence has no dissolution, nor is a
sound significative, but is an essential Word and essential Wisdom,
which is the true Son. For were He not essential, God will be speaking
into the air <span id="fr_3277"></span>[3278](#fn_3277.md) , and having a
body, in nothing differently from men; but since He is not man, neither
is His Word according to the infirmity of man <span
id="fr_3278"></span>[3279](#fn_3278.md) . For as the Beginning is one
Essence, so Its Word is one, essential, and subsisting, and Its Wisdom.
For as He is God from God, and Wisdom from the Wise, and Word from the
Rational, and Son from Father, so is He from Subsistence Subsistent, and
from Essence Essential and Substantive, and Being from Being.

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.i-p10"></span>2. Since were He not essential Wisdom
and substantive Word, and Son existing, but simply Wisdom and Word and
Son in the Father, then the Father Himself would have a nature
compounded of Wisdom and Word. But if so, the forementioned absurdities
would follow; and He will be His own Father, and the Son begetting and
begotten by Himself; or Word, Wisdom, Son, is a name only, and He does
not subsist who owns, or rather who is, these titles. If then He does
not subsist, the names are idle and empty, unless we say that God is
Very Wisdom <span id="fr_3279"></span>[3280](#fn_3279.md) and Very Word.
But if so, He is His own Father and Son; Father, when Wise, Son, when
Wisdom; but these things are not in God as a certain quality; away with
the dishonourable <span id="fr_3280"></span>[3281](#fn_3280.md) thought;
for it will issue in this, that God is compounded of essence and
quality <span id="fr_3281"></span>[3282](#fn_3281.md) . For whereas all
quality is in essence, it will clearly follow that the Divine Monad,
indivisible as it is, must be compound, being severed into essence and
accident <span id="fr_3282"></span>[3283](#fn_3282.md) . We must ask then
these headstrong men; The Son was proclaimed as God’s Wisdom and Word;
how then is He such? if as a quality, the absurdity has been shewn; but
if God is that Very Wisdom, then it is the absurdity of Sabellius;
therefore He is so, as an Offspring in a proper sense from the Father
<span id="page_434">p. 434</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.vi.i-Page_434"></span>Himself, according to the illustration
of light. For as there is light from fire, so from God is there a Word,
and Wisdom from the Wise, and from the Father a Son. For in this way the
Monad remains undivided and entire, and Its Son, Word not unessential,
nor not subsisting, but essential truly. For were it not so, all that is
said would be said notionally <span id="fr_3283"></span>[3284](#fn_3283.md)
and verbally <span id="fr_3284"></span>[3285](#fn_3284.md) . But if we must
avoid that absurdity, then is a true Word essential. For as there is a
Father truly, so Wisdom truly. In this respect then they are two; not
because, as Sabellius said, Father and Son are the same, but because the
Father is Father and the Son Son, and they are one, because He is Son of
the Essence of the Father by nature, existing as His own Word. This the
Lord said, viz. ‘I and the Father are One <span
id="fr_3285"></span>[3286](#fn_3285.md) ;’ for neither is the Word
separated from the Father, nor was or is the Father ever Wordless; on
this account He says, ‘I in the Father and the Father in Me <span
id="fr_3286"></span>[3287](#fn_3286.md) .’

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.i-p19"></span>3. And again, Christ is the Word of
God. Did He then subsist by Himself, and subsisting, has He become
joined to the Father, or did God make Him or call Him His Word? If the
former, I mean if He subsisted by Himself and is God, then there are two
Beginnings; and moreover, as is plain, He is not the Father’s own, as
being not of the Father, but of Himself. But if on the contrary He be
made externally, then is He a creature. It remains then to say that He
is from God Himself; but if so, that which is from another is one thing,
and that from which it is, is a second; according to this then there are
two. But if they be not two, but the names belong to the same, cause and
effect will be the same, and begotten and begetting, which has been
shewn absurd in the instance of Sabellius. But if He be from Him, yet
not another, He will be both begetting and not begetting; begetting
because He produces from Himself, and not begetting, because it is
nothing other than Himself. But if so, the same is called Father and Son
notionally. But if it be unseemly so to say, Father and Son must be two;
and they are one, because the Son is not from without, but begotten of
God. But if any one shrinks from saying ‘Offspring,’ and only says that
the Word exists with God, let such a one fear lest, shrinking from what
is said in Scripture, he fall into absurdity, making God a being of
double nature. For not granting that the Word is from the Monad, but
simply as if He were joined to the Father, he introduces a twofold
essence, and neither of them Father of the other. And the same of Power.
And we may see this more clearly, if we consider it with reference to
the Father; for there is One Father, and not two, but from that One the
Son. As then there are not two Fathers, but One, so not two Beginnings,
but One, and from that One the Son essential.

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.i-p20"></span>4. But the Arians we must ask
contrariwise: (for the Sabellianisers must be confuted from the notion
of a Son, and the Arians from that of a Father:) let us say then—Is God
wise and not word-less: or on the contrary, is He wisdom-less and
word-less <span id="fr_3287"></span>[3288](#fn_3287.md) ? if the latter,
there is an absurdity at once; if the former, we must ask, how is He
wise and not word-less? does He possess the Word and the Wisdom from
without, or from Himself? If from without, there must be one who first
gave to Him, and before He received He was wisdom-less and word-less.
But if from Himself, it is plain that the Word is not from nothing, nor
once was not; for He was ever; since He of whom He is the Image, exists
ever. But if they say that He is indeed wise and not word-less, but that
He has in Himself His own wisdom and own word, and that, not Christ, but
that by which He made Christ, we must answer that, if Christ in that
word was brought to be, plainly so were all things; and it must be He of
whom John says, ‘All things were made by Him,’ and the Psalmist, ‘In
Wisdom hast Thou made them all <span
id="fr_3288"></span>[3289](#fn_3288.md) .’ And Christ will be found to
speak untruly, ‘I in the Father,’ there being another in the Father. And
‘the Word became flesh <span id="fr_3289"></span>[3290](#fn_3289.md) ’ is
not true according to them. For if He in whom ‘all things came to be,’
Himself became flesh, but Christ is not in the Father, as Word ‘by whom
all things came to be,’ then Christ has not become flesh, but perhaps
Christ was named Word. But if so, first, there will be another besides
the name, next, all things were not by Him brought to be, but in that
other, in whom Christ also was made. But if they say that Wisdom is in
the Father as a quality or that He is Very Wisdom <span
id="fr_3290"></span>[3291](#fn_3290.md) , the absurdities will follow
already mentioned. For He will be compound <span
id="fr_3291"></span>[3292](#fn_3291.md) , and will prove His own Son and
Father <span id="fr_3292"></span>[3293](#fn_3292.md) . Moreover, we must
confute and silence them on the ground, that the Word which is in God
cannot be a creature nor out of nothing; but if once a Word be in God,
then He must be Christ who says, ‘I am in the Father and the Father in
Me <span id="fr_3293"></span>[3294](#fn_3293.md) ,’ who also is therefore
the Only-begotten, since no other was begotten from Him. This is One
Son, who is Word, Wisdom, Power; for God is not compounded of these,
<span id="page_435">p. 435</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.vi.i-Page_435"></span>but is generative <span
id="fr_3294"></span>[3295](#fn_3294.md) of them. For as He frames the
creatures by the Word, so according to the nature of His own Essence has
He the Word as an Offspring, through whom He frames and creates and
dispenses all things. For by the Word and the Wisdom all things have
come to be, and all things together remain according to His
ordinance <span id="fr_3295"></span>[3296](#fn_3295.md) . And the same
concerning the word ‘Son;’ if God be without Son <span
id="fr_3296"></span>[3297](#fn_3296.md) , then is He without Work; for the
Son is His Offspring through whom He works <span
id="fr_3297"></span>[3298](#fn_3297.md) ; but if not, the same questions
and the same absurdities will follow their audacity.

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.i-p32"></span>5. From Deuteronomy; ‘But ye that did
attach yourselves unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this
day <span id="fr_3298"></span>[3299](#fn_3298.md) .’ From this we may see
the difference, and know that the Son of God is not a creature. For the
Son says, ‘I and the Father are One,’ and, ‘I in the Father, and the
Father in Me;’ but things originate, when they make advance, are
attached unto the Lord. The Word then is in the Father as being His own;
but things originate, being external, are attached, as being by nature
foreign, and attached by free choice. For a son which is by nature, is
one <span id="fr_3299"></span>[3300](#fn_3299.md) with him who begat him;
but he who is from without, and is made a son, will be attached to the
family. Therefore he immediately adds, ‘What nation is there so great
who hath God drawing nigh unto them <span
id="fr_3300"></span>[3301](#fn_3300.md) ?’ and elsewhere, ‘I a God drawing
nigh <span id="fr_3301"></span>[3302](#fn_3301.md) ;’ for to things
originate He draws nigh, as being strange to Him, but to the Son, as
being His own, He does not draw nigh, but He is in Him. And the Son is
not attached to the Father, but co-exists with Him; whence also Moses
says again in the same Deuteronomy, ‘Ye shall obey His voice, and apply
yourselves unto Him <span id="fr_3302"></span>[3303](#fn_3302.md) ;’ but
what is applied, is applied from without.
