<span id="xix.ii.xxvi-p1"></span> 26. *He acted according to the example
of the Saints. Character of his accusers.*

<span id="xix.ii.xxvi-p2"></span>Being careful to avoid such an offence,
and instructed by these examples, I so ordered my conduct; and I do not
undervalue the favour and the help which have been shewn me of the Lord,
howsoever these in their madness may gnash their teeth <span
id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502) against us. For since the manner of
our retreat was such as we have described, I do not think that any blame
whatever can attach to it in the minds of those who are possessed of a
sound judgment: seeing that according to holy Scripture, this pattern
has been left us by the Saints for our instruction. But there is no
atrocity, it would seem, which these men neglect to practise, nor will
they leave anything undone which may shew their own wickedness and
cruelty. And indeed their lives are only in accordance with their spirit
and the follies of their doctrines; for there are no sins that one could
charge them with, how heinous soever, that they do not commit without
shame. Leontius <span id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503) for instance
being censured for his intimacy with a certain young woman, named
Eustolium, and prohibited from living with her, mutilated himself for
her sake, in order that he might be able to associate with her freely.
He did not however clear himself from suspicion, but rather on this
account he was degraded from his rank as Presbyter. \[Although the
heretic Constantius by violence caused him to be named a Bishop <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504) .\] Narcissus <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505) , besides being charged with many
other transgressions, was degraded three times by different Councils;
and now he is among them, most wicked man. And George <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506) , who was a Presbyter, was deposed
for his wickedness, and although he had nominated himself a Bishop, he
was nevertheless a second time deposed in the great Council of Sardica.
And besides all this, his dissolute life was notorious, for he is
condemned even by his own friends, as making the end of existence, and
its happiness, to consist in the commission of the most disgraceful
crimes.
