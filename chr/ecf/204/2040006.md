<span id="v.i.i-p4"></span><span class="c40"><span
id="v.i.i-p4.1"></span>Literature</span>

<span id="v.i.i-p5"></span>§1. <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p5.1"></span>Editions</span>, &c. (A) Before 1601 only Latin
translations. The first, at <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p5.2"></span>Vicenza</span>, 1482, completed by Barnabas
Celsanus after the death of the translator <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p5.3"></span>Omnibonus</span> of Lonigo; dedicated to Paul II.
Contained a few works only, viz. the ‘two books *c. Gentes*,’ the letter
to Serapion *de Morte Arii*, the *De Incarn. adv. Arian.* and *adv.
Apollin.,* ‘the Dispute with Arius at the Council of Nicæa.’ (2) <span
class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p5.4"></span>Paris</span>, 1520, pub. by
Jean <span class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p5.5"></span>Petit</span>: two
books *c. Gent*. fragment of the *ad Marcellin*. and some ‘spuria.’ (3)
Second edition at <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p5.6"></span>Strassburg</span>, 1522. (4) <span
class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p5.7"></span>Basel</span>, 1527, by <span
class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p5.8"></span>Eramus</span>: *Serap*. ill.
and iv., *de Decr., Apol. Fug., Apol. c. Ar*. (part of), ‘*ad Monach.*,’
and some ‘spuria’ (he rejected *Serap*. i. as unworthy of Athan.!). (5)
<span class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p5.9"></span>Lyons</span>, 1532, same
contents as numbers (2) and (4), but with renderings by Politian,
Reuchlin, Erasmus, &c. (6) <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p5.10"></span>Cologne</span>, 1632, similar contents. (7)
1556, <span class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p5.11"></span>Basel</span>
(‘apud Frobenium’), by P. <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p5.12"></span>Nannius</span>, in 4 volumes; great advance on
previous editions. 3 vols. contain the version by Nannius of the
‘genuina,’ the fourth ‘spuria,’ rendered by others. The Nannian version
was ably tested, and found wanting, under the direction of the
congregation of the Index (Migne xxv. pp. xviii. *sqq*.). (8) 1564 (or
1584?) <span class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p5.13"></span>Basel</span>
(substantially the same). (9) 1570, <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p5.14"></span>Paris</span>, *Vita Antonii* and ‘five dialogues
*de Trin*.,’ version of Beza. (10) 1572, <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p5.15"></span>Paris</span>, five volumes, combining Nos. 7 and
9. (II) 1574, <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p5.16"></span>Paris</span>, Letter *ad Amun, Letter* 39
(fragment), Letter *ad Rufinianum*. (12) 1581, <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p5.17"></span>Paris</span>, incorporating the latter with No.
10. (13) <span class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p5.18"></span>Rome</span>,
1623, the spurious *de variis quæstionibus*.

<span id="v.i.i-p6"></span>(B) The first Greek Edition (14) 1601 at
<span class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p6.1"></span>Heidelberg</span> by
<span class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p6.2"></span>Commelinus</span>, with
the Nannian Latin version (2 vols. fo. with a supplement of fragments,
letters, &c., communicated by P. Felckmann). This edition was founded
upon Felckmann’s collation of numerous <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p6.3"></span>mss.</span>, of which the chief were (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.i.i-p6.4"></span>α</span>) that in the Public
Library at Basel (sæc. xiv., *not* ix.–x. as Felck. states; formerly
belonged to the Dominican Friary there). (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.i.i-p6.5"></span>β</span>) The ‘Codex Christophorsoni,’ now at
Trin. Coll., Camb., sæc. xvi. *ineunt*. (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.i.i-p6.6"></span>γ</span>) A ‘Codex Goblerianus’ dated 1319,
formerly <span class="Greek"><span id="v.i.i-p6.7"></span>τῆς μονῆς τοῦ
κυρίζου</span>, and principally used by Nannius. Neither this nor the
remaining <span class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p6.8"></span>mss.</span> of
Felckmann are as yet, I believe, identified. (Particulars, Migne, P.G.
xxv. p. xliii.) (15) 1608, <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p6.9"></span>Paris</span>, pub. by C. Chappelet, edited by
Fronton le Duc, S.J., Latin only. (17) 1612, <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p6.10"></span>Paris</span>, No. 15, with *Vit. Ant*. in Greek
and Latin, from an edition (16) of 1611, <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p6.11"></span>Augsburg</span>, by Höschel, 4º. (18) 1627,
<span class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p6.12"></span>Paris</span>, Greek text
of 1601 with version of Nannius from edition No. 17, both injudiciously
revised by Jean le Pescheur, from the critical notes of Felckmann
himself, which however are omitted in this edition. (19) ‘Cologne,’ or
rather <span class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p6.13"></span>Leipzig</span>,
1686, poor reprint of No. 18 with the *Syntagma Doctrinæ* which Arnold
had published in the previous year (see below, ch. ii. §9). (Montf.
wrongly dates this 1681.)

<span id="v.i.i-p7"></span>(C) All the above were entirely superseded by
the great (20) 1698 Paris Benedictine Edition by Bernard de <span
class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p7.1"></span>Montfaucon</span>, aided, for
part of vol. 1, by Jacques Loppin, 3 volumes fol. (i.e. vol. 1, parts 1
and 2, ‘genuina,’ vol. 2 ‘dubia et spuria’), with a <span
class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p7.2"></span>new</span> Latin Version and
ample prolegomena, &c. Montfaucon took over, apparently without
revision, the critical data of Felckmann (including his mistake as to
the age of the Basel <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p7.3"></span>ms.</span> but collated very many fresh <span
class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p7.4"></span>mss.</span> (principally
Parisian, full particulars in Migne xxvi. pp. 1449, *sqq*.), and for the
first time put the text on a fairly satisfactory footing. The Works of
Athanasius were freshly arranged with an attempt at chronological order,
and a ‘Monitum’ or short introduction prefixed to each. Critical, and a
few explanatory, notes throughout; also an ‘onomasticon’ or glossary.
This splendid edition was far more complete than its predecessors, and
beautifully printed. After its completion, Montfaucon discovered fresh
material, most of which he published in vol. 2 of his ‘<span
class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p7.5"></span>Collectio Nova Patrum</span>,’
Paris, 1706, with some further supplementary matter to his Prolegomena,
partly in reply to Tillemont upon various critical questions; small
additions in his *Biblioth. Coisliniana*, 1715. (The letters to Lucifer,
included in Montfaucon’s edition, had already seen the light in vol. iv.
of the Bibliotheca Maxima Patrum (Lyons, 1677, Greek fathers in Latin
only), and the two notes to Orsisius were taken from the life of
Pachomius in the Acta SS. for May.)

<span id="v.i.i-p8"></span>(21) 1746, <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p8.1"></span>Rome</span>, the *de Titulis Psalmorum*, edited
from Barberini and Vatican <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p8.2"></span>mss.</span> by Cardinal Niccolo <span
class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p8.3"></span>Antonelli</span>. (22) 1769,
<span class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p8.4"></span>Venice</span>, vol. v. of
the ‘Bibliotheca Patrum’ of the Oratorian Andrea <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p8.5"></span>Gallandi</span>. Contains the works omitted in
No. 20, chiefly from Montf. *Coll. Nov*., but with a few minor
additions, and with the fragments and letters found by Maffei at Verona
(see below, pp. 495, 554). (23) 1777, <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p8.6"></span>Padua</span>, by <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p8.7"></span>Giustiniani</span>, in four volumes, containing
firstly Montfaucon’s ‘genuina’ in two volumes, the ‘dubia’ and ‘spuria’
in the third, and the supplementary matter from (21) and (22) in the
fourth. The printing of this standard edition is not equal to that of
No. 20. (24) ‘1884’ (1857), <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p8.8"></span>Paris</span>, vols. xxv.–xxviii. of <span
class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p8.9"></span>Migne’s</span> Patrologia
Græca, a reprint of No. 23, but in a new order (see vol. xxviii. p.
1650), and with the addition of the *Festal Letters* from Mai (see
below, p. 501). The merits and demerits of this series are well known.
Of the latter, the most serious are the misprints, with which every page
literally teems.

<span id="v.i.i-p9"></span>(D) With Migne’s edition the publication of a
complete Athanasius (so far as his works are known to be extant) is
attained, although there is still everything to be done towards the
revision of the text on a critical basis. Among modern editions of large
portions of Athanasius from the Benedictine text may be mentioned (25)
<span class="c10"><span id="v.i.i-p9.1"></span>Thilo</span>, *Athan.
Opp. dogm. Selecta*, Leipz. 1853. (26) <span class="c10"><span
id="v.i.i-p9.2"></span>Bright</span>, *Orations against the Arians*
(1873 2nd ed. 1883), and *Historical Writings* of Athanasius, 1881 (Oxf.
Univ. Press), with introductions; both <span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>
<span id="v.i.i-Page_xii"></span>most convenient; his *Lessons from the
lives of three great Fathers* (Longmans, 1890) gives an interesting
popular study of Athan. Editions of separate books will be noticed in
the short Introductions prefixed in this volume.
