<span id="xviii.ii.ix-p1"></span> 9. *Athanasius could not write to one
who did not even know him.*

<span id="xviii.ii.ix-p2"></span>For myself, I am so surprised at the
enormity of the thing, that I am quite uncertain what I ought to say in
my defence. I can only declare, that I condemn myself to die ten
thousand deaths, if even the least suspicion attaches to me in this
matter. And to you, Sire, as a lover of the truth, I confidently make my
appeal. I beseech you, as I said before, investigate this affair, and
especially with the testimony of those who were once sent by him as
ambassadors to you. These are the Bishops Sarvatius <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312.md) and Maximus and the rest, with
Clementius and Valens. Enquire of them, I beseech you, whether they
brought letters to me. If they did, this would give me occasion to write
to him. But if he did not write to me, if he did not even know me, how
could I write to one with whom I had no acquaintance? Ask them whether,
when I saw Clementius and his fellows, and spoke of your brother of
blessed memory, I did not, in the language of Scripture, wet my garments
with tears <span id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313.md) , when I
remembered his kindness of disposition and his Christian spirit. Learn
of them how anxious I was, on hearing of the cruelty of the beast, and
finding that Valens and his company had come by way of Libya, lest he
should attempt a passage also, and like a robber murder those who held
in love and memory the departed Prince, among whom I account myself
second to none.

<span id="xviii.ii.ix-p3"></span> Sarbatius, or Servatius, and Maximus
occur in the lists of Gallic subscriptions \[*supr.* p. 127\]. The
former is supposed to be S. Servatius or Servatio of Tungri, concerning
whom at Ariminum, vid. Sulp. Sev. *Hist.* ii. 59. vid. also Greg. Turon.
*Hist. Franc* ii. 5. where however the Bened. Ed. prefers to read
Aravatius, a Bishop, as he considers, of the fifth century.
