<span id="xvi.ii.xvii-p1"></span> 49. But when he saw himself beset by
many, and not suffered to withdraw himself according to his intent as he
wished, fearing because of the signs which the Lord wrought by him, that
either he should be puffed up, or that some other should think of him
above what he ought to think, he considered and set off to go into the
upper Thebaid, among those to whom he was unknown. And having received
loaves from the brethren, he sat down by the bank of the river, looking
whether a boat would go by, that, having embarked thereon, he might go
up the river with them. While he was considering these things, a voice
came to him from above, ‘Antony, whither goest thou and wherefore?’ But
he no way disturbed, but as he had been accustomed to be called <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090.md) often thus, giving ear to it,
answered, saying, ‘Since the multitude permit me not to be still, I wish
to go into the upper Thebaid on account of the many hindrances that come
upon me here, and especially because they demand of me things beyond my
power.’ But the voice said unto him, ‘Even though you should go into the
Thebaid, or even though, as you have in mind, you should go down to the
Bucolia <span id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091.md) , you will have to
endure more, aye, double the amount of toil. But if you wish really to
be in quiet, depart now into the inner desert.’ And when Antony said,
‘Who will show me the way for I know it not?’ immediately the voice
pointed out to him Saracens about to go that way. So Antony approached,
and drew near them, and asked that he might go with them into the
desert. And they, as though they had been commanded by Providence,
received him willingly. And having journeyed with them three days and
three nights, he came to a very lofty mountain, and at the foot of the
mountain ran a clear spring, whose waters were sweet and very cold;
outside there was a plain and a few uncared-for palm trees.

<span id="xvi.ii.xvii-p4"></span>50. Antony then, as it were, moved by
God, loved the place <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092.md) , for
this was the spot which he who had spoken with him by the banks of the
river had pointed out. So having first received loaves from his fellow
travellers, he abode in the mountain alone, no one else being with him.
And recognising it as his own home, he remained in that place for the
future. But the Saracens, having seen the earnestness of Antony,
purposely used to journey that way, and joyfully brought him loaves,
while now and then the palm trees also afforded him a poor and frugal
relish. But after this, the brethren learning of the place, like
children mindful of their father, took care to send to him. But when
Antony saw that the bread was the cause of trouble and hardships to some
of them, to spare the monks this, he resolved to ask some of those who
came to bring him a spade, an axe, and a little corn. And when these
were brought, he went over the land round the mountain, and having found
a small plot of suitable ground, tilled it; and having a plentiful
supply of water for watering, he sowed. This doing year by year, he got
his bread from thence, rejoicing that thus he would be troublesome to no
one, and because he kept himself from being a burden to anybody. But
after this, seeing again that people came, he cultivated a few
pot-herbs, that he who came to him might have some slight solace after
the labour <span id="page_210">p. 210</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.xvii-Page_210"></span>of that hard journey. At first,
however, the wild beasts in the desert, coming because of the water,
often injured his seeds and husbandry. But he, gently laying hold of one
of them, said to them all, ‘Why do you hurt me, when I hurt none of you?
Depart, and in the name of the Lord come not nigh this spot.’ And from
that time forward, as though fearful of his command, they no more came
near the place.
