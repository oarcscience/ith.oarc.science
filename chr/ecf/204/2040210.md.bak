<span id="xvi.i-p4"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xvi.i-p4.1"></span>The</span> Life of St. Antony is included in the
present collection partly on account of the important influence it has
exercised upon the development of the ascetic life in the Church, partly
and more especially on the ground of its strong claim to rank as a work
of Athanasius. If that claim were undisputed, no apology would be needed
for its presence in this volume. If on the other hand its spurious and
unhistorical character had been finally demonstrated, its insertion
would be open to just objections. As it is, the question being still in
dispute, although the balance of qualified opinion is on the side of the
Athanasian authorship, it is well that the reader should have the work
before him and judge for himself. To assist his judgment, it will be
attempted in the following paragraphs to state the main reasons on
either side. In doing so, I can honestly disclaim any bias for or
against the *Vita,* or monasticism. Monasticism, with all its good and
evil, is a great outgrowth of human life and instinct, a great fact in
the history of the Christian religion; and whether its origin is to be
put fifty years earlier or later (for that is the net value of the
question at issue) is a somewhat small point relatively to the great
problems which it offers to the theologian, the historian, and the
moralist. But the point is at any rate worthy of careful and
dispassionate examination. In attempting this, while holding no brief
for either side, I may as well at once state my opinion on the evidence,
namely that, genuine as are many of the difficulties which surround the
question, the external evidence for the *Vita* is too strong to allow us
to set it aside as spurious, and that in view of that evidence the
attempts to give a positive account of the book as a spurious
composition have failed.

<span id="xvi.i-p5"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="xvi.i-p5.1"></span>Bibliography</span>. a. *Sources.* The only
reference to Antony in other writings of Athanasius is in *Hist. Ar.*
14. See also *Fest. Index* x. *Vita Pachomii* in *Act. SS. Mai.,* Tom.
iii. Appx. (written late in the fourth century, but by a person who had
known Pachomius). *Coptic fragments and documents* (for early history of
Egyptian monasticism with occasional details about Antony) in Zoega,
*Catalogus codd. Copticorum,* (Rome, 1810), Mingarelli, *Codd.
copticorum reliquiæ,* (Bologna, 1785), Revillout, *Rapport sur une
mission,* etc. (in *Archives des Missions scientifiques et littéraires,*
3me, série, 1879, vol. 4), Amélineau, *Hist. de S. Pakhôme*, &c.
(Annales du Musée Guimet, vol. xvii. Paris, 1889).

<span id="xvi.i-p6"></span>b. *Modern discussions.* Since the
Reformation the general tendency of protestant writers has been to
discredit, of Roman Catholics to maintain the authority of the Vita. To
the former class belong the Magdeburg Centuriators, Rivet, Basnage,
Casimir Oudin; to the latter, Bellarmin, Noel Alexandre, and above all
Montfaucon in the Benedictine edition of Athanasius (especially in the
*Vita Athanasii, Animadversio II. in Vitam et Scripta S.A.*, and the
*Monitum in Antonii Vitam*, which latter may still claim the first rank
in critical discussions of the problem). We may add, as more or less
unbiassed defenders of the *Vita*, Cave (*Hist. Lit.* i. 193), and
Tillemont (*Mem.* vol. vii.). All the above belong to the period before
1750. In more recent times the attack has been led by Weingarten
(*Ursprung des Mönchtums in nachkonst. zeitalter*, reprinted in 1877
from *Zeitschrift für K.G.* 1876, and in Herzog, vol. x. pp. 758 sqq.),
followed by Gass (in *Ztsch. K.G.* II. 274), and Gwatkin (*Studies*, &c.
pp. 98–103). Israel, in *Zeitsch. Wiss. Theol.* 1880, p. 130, &c.,
characterises Weingarten’s attack on the *Vita* as ‘too bold.’ Keim
(*Aus dem Urchr.* 207 sqq.) and Hilgenfeld (*in Zeitsch. f. Wiss.
Theol.* 1878) put the book in the lifetime of Ath. without absolutely
pronouncing for him as the author, while Hase (*J. Prot. Th.* 1880),
Harnack (especially in *Th. Ltz.* xi. 391, <span id="page_189">p.
189</span> <span id="xvi.i-Page_189"></span>see also ‘*Das Mönchtum*’
*u.s.w.*, Giessen, 1886), Möller, *Lehrb. der K.G.* i. 372, and Eichhorn
(‘*Athanasii de vita ascetica testimonia,*’ Halle, 1886, the most
convincing discussion of recent date, and indispensable) decide without
hesitation in its favour. The discussion of Bornemann (*In investigando
monachatus origine, quibus de causis ratio habenda sit Origenis,
Leipzig,* 1885) may also be mentioned as bearing on the general subject;
also the articles ‘Monastery,’ ‘Cœnobium,’ and ‘Hermits’ in D. C. A. The
article ‘Antony’ in D. C. B. passes over the question without
discussion, excepting the trite, but untenable, statement that the Vita
‘is probably interpolated.’ Farrar (*Lives of the Fathers*, and
*Contemp. Review*, Nov. 1887) follows Gwatkin. Picturesque
representations of Antony (from the *Vita*) in Kingsley’s *Hermits* and
Newman’s *Historical Sketches*, vol. 2.

<span id="xvi.i-p7"></span>2. <span class="c10"><span
id="xvi.i-p7.1"></span>External evidence as to authorship and
date</span>. This is given by Montfaucon in the *Monitum* and reproduced
by Eichhorn, pp. 36 sqq.

<span id="xvi.i-p8"></span>i. *The Version of Evagrius.* Evagrius,
presbyter (Eustathian) and subsequently (388) Bishop at Antioch (in
Italy 364–373), translated the *Vita Antonii* into Latin. He prefaced
with a short apology (see below, *Vit. Ant.* §1, note 1) for the freedom
of his rendering, addressed ‘Innocentio carissimo filio.’ Now this
Innocent, the friend of Jerome and Evagrius, died in the summer of 374,
almost exactly a year after the death of Athanasius (D. C. B. iii. 31,
251). Of this identification there is no reason to doubt; still less
ground is there for the hesitation (*Hist. Lit.* I. 283, ‘non una est
dubitandi ratio’) of Cave and others as to the identity of the version,
printed by Montfaucon and transmitted by very numerous <span
class="c10"><span id="xvi.i-p8.1"></span>mss.</span> (‘quæ ingenti
numero vidi,’ Migne xxv. p. clviii.) with that actually made by
Evagrius. Therefore, even if we make the two very improbable assumptions
that the Dedication to Innocentius falls within a few weeks or days of
his death (i.e. during the journey from Italy to Syria!), and that the
*Vita* was translated by Evagrius almost immediately upon its
composition, the composition of the *Vita* falls within a few months of
the death of Athanasius. Its antiquity then ‘is fully conceded’ even by
Mr. Gwatkin (*Studies*, p. 103, who yet, p. 98, puts it down to ‘the
generation after Athanasius!’). The translation of Evagrius also
preserves what looks like the original heading. It should be added that
the Evagrian version (read in the light of its preface), entirely
excludes the hypothesis that the Greek text of the *Vita* is
interpolated. Evagrius avowedly abridges at times, while in some cases
he embellishes (see §82, note 16).

<span id="xvi.i-p9"></span>ii. Jerome wrote his *Vita Pauli* in the
Syrian desert, between 374 and 379. He mentions both the *Vita* and its
Latin Version in the prologue: if he had seen the latter he can scarcely
have been ignorant of its heading. The non-mention of Athanasius as the
author is an *argumentum ex silentio* of the most precarious kind. Some
fifteen years later (*de Script Eccles.* 87, 88, 125) he repeatedly
mentions Athanasius as the author, and specifies Evagrius as the
translator.

<span id="xvi.i-p10"></span>iii. Ephrem the Syrian (Opp. ed. 1732–43, I.
p. 249) quotes ‘Saint’ Athanasius by name as the biographer of Antony.
Ephrem died in 373. But little stress can be laid upon this testimony,
in view of the lack of a critical sifting of the works which bear the
name of this saint (so Tillemont viii. 229, and vii. 138). More
important is

<span id="xvi.i-p11"></span>iv. Gregory Naz. *Or.* 21, ‘Athanasius
compiled the biography of the divine Antony <span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.i-p11.1"></span>τοῦ μοναδικοῦ βίου νομοθεσίαν ἐν πλάσματι
διηγήσεως</span>’ (cf. *Vita*, Prologue). This oration was delivered in
380, seven years after the death of Athanasius. Gregory, it is true, is
not a good judge on a point of criticism. But he expresses the opinion
of his time, and confirms and is confirmed by the evidence of Evagrius
and Jerome.

<span id="xvi.i-p12"></span>v. Rufinus, *Hist. Eccl.* I. viii. He would
give an account of Antony, but ‘ille libellus exclusit qui ab Athanasio
scriptus etiam Latino Sermone editus est.’ This was written 400 <span
class="c10"><span id="xvi.i-p12.1"></span>a.d.</span>: if in a later
work (*Hist. Mon.* 30, and see also 29) he happens to allude to the Vita
without mentioning its author, we are not entitled to say that to
Rufinus ‘the work is anonymous’ (Gwatkin, p. 103).

<span id="xvi.i-p13"></span>vi. The *Life of Pachomius*, which (as above
mentioned) has details of Antony’s life independent of the Vita, also
mentions the latter (c. 1) as the work of Athanasius. Though written
perhaps as late as 390, this document is of great weight as evidence in
the case (see Krüger in *Theol. Ltzg.* 1890, p. 620).

<span id="xvi.i-p14"></span>vii. Paulinus in his prologue to the Life of
Ambrose (after 400) refers to the *Vita* as written by Athanasius.

<span id="xvi.i-p15"></span>viii. Fifth-century historians, Palladius,
*Hist. Laus.* 8, Socrates (*H. E*., i. 21) Sozomenus (i. 13) attest the
established tradition of their day that Athanasius was the author of the
Life.

<span id="xvi.i-p16"></span><span id="page_190">p. 190</span> <span
id="xvi.i-Page_190"></span>ix. Augustine (*Conf.* viii. 14, 15, 19, 29)
and Chrysostom (*Hom.* 8 on S. Matthew) mention the *Vita* without
giving the name of the author. But we are not entitled to cite them as
witnesses to its (alleged) anonymity, which they neither affirm nor
imply.

<span id="xvi.i-p17"></span>The above witnesses, all of whom excepting
No. viii. come within 50 years of the death of Athanasius, are a
formidable array. No other work of Athanasius can boast of such external
evidence in its favour. And in the face of such evidence it is
impossible to place the composition later than the lifetime of the great
Bishop. We have therefore to ask whether the contents of the *Vita* are
in irreconcileable conflict with the result of the external evidence:
whether they point, not indeed to a later age, for the external evidence
excludes this, but to an author who during the lifetime of Athanasius
(i.e. not later than the year of his death) ventured to publish a
hagiographic romance in his name (‘Evagrian’ heading, and §§71, 82).

<span id="xvi.i-p18"></span>3. <span class="c10"><span
id="xvi.i-p18.1"></span>Internal Evidence</span>. It may be remarked *in
limine* that for the existence of Antony there is not only the evidence
of the *Vita* itself, but also that of many other fourth-century
documents (see above 1.a. under ‘sources’). Weingarten quite admits this
(*R. E.*, X. 774, but he implies the contrary in his *Zeit-tafeln*, ed.
3, p. 228); and Mr. Gwatkin is certainly far ahead of his evidence when
he pronounces (Arian Controversy, p. 48) that Antony ‘never existed.’

<span id="xvi.i-p19"></span>*a. Origin and early history of
Monasticism*. According to the *Vita*, the desert was unknown to <span
class="Greek"><span id="xvi.i-p19.1"></span>μοναχοί</span> (solitary
ascetics) at the time (about 275? *Vit*. §3) when Antony first adopted
the ascetic life. About the year 285 he began his twenty years’ sojourn
in the ruined fort. To the end of this sojourn belongs the first great
wave of Monastic settlement in the desert. During the later part of the
great persecution ‘monasteries’ and monks begin to abound (§44, 46). The
remainder of his long life (311–356) is passed mainly in his ‘inner
mountain,’ where he forms the head and centre of Egyptian monasticism.
Now it is contended by Weingarten and his followers that the *Vita* is
contradicted in this important particular by all the real evidence as to
the origin of monasticism, which cannot be proved to have originated
before the death of Constantine. But Eichhorn has I think conclusively
shewn the hastiness of this assumption. Passing over the disputable
evidence of the *De Vita Contemplativa* ascribed to Philo, (which
Weingarten endeavours, against Lucius and others, to put back to a date
much earlier than the third century and out of relation to Christian
asceticism <span id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978) .md), the writings of
Athanasius himself are the sufficient refutation of the late date
assigned to the rise of monachism.

<span id="xvi.i-p21"></span>In the writings of the supposed date
(356–362) of the *Vita*, references to monks are very frequent (e.g.
*Apol. Fug*. 4, *Apol. Const*. 29): but previous to this (339) we find
them mentioned in *Encyl.* §3, and yet earlier, *Apol. Ar.* 67 (see
below). In the letter to Dracontius (*Letter* 49 in this vol.),
corporate monasticism is implied to be no novel institution. Dracontius
himself (about 354) is president of a monastery, and many other similar
communities are referred to. (Gwatkin deals with this letter in an
unsatisfactory fashion, p. 102, see the letter itself, §§7, 9, and
notes.) The letter to Amun, probably earlier than that just mentioned,
is clearly (sub. fin.) addressed to the head of a monastic society.
Again, the bishops Muis and Paulus of *Letter* 49, §7, who were monks
before their consecration, had been in the monastery of Tabennæ before
the death of Pachomius, which occurred almost certainly in 346 (Eichhorn
12, 13. The whole history of Pachomius, who was only a year or two older
than Athanasius, although personally but little known to him, his
monastery being at Tabennæ, an island near Philæ, is in conflict with
Weingarten’s theory). Lastly <span id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979.md) one
of the most characteristic and life-like of the documents relating to
the case of Arsenius and the Council of Tyre, namely the letter of
Pinnes to John Arcaph (*Apol. Ar.* 67) carries back the evidence earlier
still. Pinnes is ‘presbyter of a monastery’ (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.i-p22.2"></span>μονή</span>): that <span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.i-p22.3"></span>μονή</span> here means a society of monks, and
not a posting station (Weing. in *R. E.*, X. p. 775) is clear from the
mention of ‘Helias the monk,’ and ‘I, Paphnutius, monk *of the same
monastery*.’ This letter proves that there were not only Catholic but
Meletian monks, and these not hermits but in societies: and thus the
origin of the solitary type of monasticism goes back as far as the
Meletian schism. (The existence of Meletian monks is attested
independently of this letter, see Eich. p. 347.) Weingarten is quite
unable to deal with this obstacle to his theory. His argument is simply
this: either the letter has nothing to do with monks and monasteries (he
overlooks Paphnutius), <span id="page_191">p. 191</span> <span
id="xvi.i-Page_191"></span>or it must be rejected as spurious! What
*reductio ad absurdum* could be more complete? In an equally desperate
way he deals with the clear evidence of Aphraates, *Hom.* vi., as to the
existence of (at any rate) solitary monasticism in Eastern Syria as
early as 336. See *Texte und Untersuchungen* iii. 3, pp. xvi. 89, &c.
(Leipzig, 1888.)

<span id="xvi.i-p23"></span>*b. Historical misstatements*. i. It is
better to include under this head rather than under the last the title
*ad peregrinos fratres*. Who were the ‘foreign monks’ (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xvi.i-p23.1"></span>τοὺς ἐν τῇ ξένῃ
μοναχούς</span>)? The introduction of monasticism into the West seems to
belong to the time of S. Ambrose (Aug. *Conf.* viii. 6, cf. Sozom. III.
14, ‘the European nations \[before 361\] had no experience of monastic
societies’) or rather Martin of Tours (D.C.B. iii. p. 840). The
statement (*Encycl. Brit.* ‘Monachism’) that Athanasius carried the
*Vita Atonii* to Rome in 340 is based on a misunderstanding of Jerome
(*Ep.* 127), who really says no more than that the existence of
monachism in Egypt first became known at Rome from the visits of
Athanasius and of his successor Peter. If then the ‘peregrini fratres’
are to be looked for in the West, we have a serious difficulty, and must
choose between the *Vita* and Sozomen. But the foreign monks may have
belonged to the East. (I cannot see that §93 ‘assumes,’ as Mr. Gwatkin
maintains, ‘the existence of numerous monks in the West.’ What is said
is simply that Antony had *been heard of*—<span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.i-p23.2"></span>ἠ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.i-p23.3"></span>κούσθη</span>—in Spain, Gaul, and Africa.)
However, the point must be left uncertain, and so far allowed to weigh
against the *Vita*.

<span id="xvi.i-p24"></span>ii. Early intercourse of Athanasius with
Antony (Prologue, and note 2). If the Benedictine text is correct, the
reference must be to the period before Athanasius became deacon to
Bishop Alexander, in fact to a period previous to 318 <span
class="c10"><span id="xvi.i-p24.1"></span>a.d.</span> Tillemont (viii.
652), who maintains the other reading, mainly relies upon the
impossibility of finding room for the intercourse in question in the
early life of Athanasius. But his only source of knowledge of that
period is Rufinus, a very poor authority, and Montfaucon replies with
some force (*Animadv.* 11) that we have no sufficient information as to
how Athanasius passed the years previous to his ordination by Alexander.
He also suggests that Athanasius may have been one of those who followed
Antony’s example (§46, cf. *Apol. c. Ar.* 6) after his first visit to
Alexandria. I may add that the notes to the *Vita* will call attention
to several points of contact between the teaching of Antony and the
earliest treatises of Athanasius. Yet the impression left on the mind is
here again one of uncertainty (cf. Prolegg. ch. ii. §1 *fin.*).

<span id="xvi.i-p25"></span>iii. The narrative about Duke Balacius (§86:
see note there) is another genuine difficulty, only to be got over if we
suppose *either* that Athanasius in one place tells the story
inaccurately, and corrects himself in the other, *or* that the *Hist.
Arian.* was partly written for Athanasius by a secretary.

<span id="xvi.i-p26"></span>iv. Supposed learning of Antony. His
ignorance of letters and of the Greek language does not prevent his
forcibly employing the most effective arguments against Arianism (69),
vindicating the Incarnation (74) much in the manner of Athanasius, and
above all showing a fair acquaintance (72–74) with Platonic philosophy
(see notes there). But everything in the biography points to a man of
robust mind, retentive memory (3) and frequent intercourse with
visitors. If he were so, he can scarcely have been ignorant of the
theological controversies of his day, or of the current philosophical
ideas. Nor can I see that the philosophy of his argument against the
Greeks goes beyond what that would imply. His allusion to Plato does not
look like a first-hand citation. And even an Athanasius would not so
entirely rise out of the biographical habits of his day as to mingle
nothing of his own with the speeches of his hero (‘Equidem quid Antonio
quid Athanasio tribuendum sit uix diiudicari posse concedo,’ Eich. p.
52).

<span id="xvi.i-p27"></span>*c. Inconsistencies with Athanasius*. It is
the most serious objection to the Athanasian authorship of the *Vita*
that Athanasius (with the exception of the ‘antilegomenon’ *Hist. Ar*.
14) nowhere else mentions Antony by name. Especially in the letter to
Dracontius, who at first refused the Episcopate in the supposed
interests of his soul, we might, it is argued, have expected a reference
to the deep reverence of Antony (§67) for even the lowest clergy (the
persons enumerated, *Letter* 49, §7, are *bishops* who had previously
been monks, and have nothing to do with this question). That is true. We
*might* have expected it. But as a matter of fact Athanasius uses
another argument instead (see *Letter* 49, §3, note 8a). It does not
follow that he *did not know* of the Antony of the Vita. But although
the letter in question has been pressed unduly, the general objection,
as an *argumentum ex silentio* on a rather large scale, remains <span
id="fr_980"></span>[981](#fn_980.md) . Some more detailed points must now
be considered.

<span id="xvi.i-p29"></span><span id="page_192">p. 192</span> <span
id="xvi.i-Page_192"></span>*a. Demons and Miracles.* The writings of
Athanasius are singularly free from the tendency to indulge in the
marvellous. The death of Arius he regards as a judgment, and relates it
with a certain awe-struck sobriety. The <span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.i-p29.1"></span>φήμη</span> of Julian’s death in the *Narrat. ad
Ammon*. comes less under the head of ecclesiastical miracle than under
that of <span class="Greek"><span id="xvi.i-p29.2"></span>τὰ θειᾶ τῶν
πρηγμάτων</span> (Herod. ix. 100, cf. Grote v. 260 sq.); whereas the
Vita swarms with miraculous and demoniacal stories, some (passed over in
silence by Newman and other apologists for the Life) indescribably silly
(e.g. §§53, 63). Hence even Cave allows that the *Vita* contains things
‘tanto viro indigna.’ But it must be observed (1) that Antony disclaims,
and his biographer disclaims for him, inherent miraculous power. His
miracles are wrought by Christ in answer to prayer, and he prefers that
those who desire his help should obtain what they want by praying for
themselves (cf. also §49). (2) That again and again (esp. §§16–43) he
insists on the absolute subjection of all evil powers to God, and their
powerlessness to injure believers in Christ. (3) That Athanasius
recognises <span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.i-p29.3"></span>σημεῖα</span> (in the sense of miracles, see
*Letter* 49, §9, note 9) as a known phenomenon in the case both of
bishops and of monks. (4) That his language about demons and the power
of the sign of the Cross in dispersing them is quite of a piece with
what is related in the *Vita* (see notes *passim*). (5) On the
*clairvoyance* of Antony, and one or two kindred matters which offer
points of contact with phenomena that have been recently the subject of
careful research, notes will be found below giving modern references. On
the whole, one could wish that Athanasius, who is in so many ways
surprisingly in touch with the modern mind (*supra*, introd. to *de
Incar* and Prolegg. ch. iv. §2 d and §3), had not written a biography
revealing such large credulity. But we must measure this credulity of
his not by the evidential methods of our own day, but by those of his
own. If we compare the *Vita,* not with our modern biographies but with
those, say, of Paul and Hilarion by Jerome, its superiority is striking
(this is pointed out by W. Israël in *Zeitschr für Wiss. Theol.* 1878,
pp. 130, 137, 145, 153). For myself I should certainly prefer to believe
that Athanasius had not written many things in the *Vita:* but I would
far rather he had written them all than the one passage *Hist. Ar.* §38
fin.

<span id="xvi.i-p30"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.i-p30.1"></span>β</span>. *Theology*. That there should be
certain characteristic differences from the theology of Athanasius is
what one would expect in an account of Antony that bore any relation to
the historical person. Such is the anthropomorphic tendency, shewn
especially in the corporeal nature ascribed to demons. Such perhaps is a
tinge of naive semi-pelagianism about the Hermit’s language (§20 and
elsewhere); we cannot forget the connection of Cassian’s Collations with
Egyptian monasticism. Once again, ‘Antony’s shame of the body is not in
the spirit of the writer *ad Amunem*’ (Gwatkin, *Studies*, p. 102).
Lastly, in Antony’s account of the heathen gods (§76) we miss the
characteristic Euhemerism of Athanasius (see *supra*, pp. 10, 62, &c.).
Throughout, in fact, the ruder monastic instinct crops up from under the
Athanasian style and thought of the biographer. But the latter is also
unmistakable (see the notes *passim*), and the differences have been
certainly made too much of. I will give one example from Mr. Gwatkin,
who says (*ubi supra*), ‘Athanasius does not speak of <span
class="Greek"><span id="xvi.i-p30.2"></span>πρόνοια</span> like the
*Vita* (c. 49, 66, 74), for *de Fuga* 25 specially refers to his
providential escape from Syrianus, and *c. Gent.* 47, <span
class="Greek"><span id="xvi.i-p30.3"></span>πρόνοια τῶν πάντων</span> is
very incidental.’ Now certainly the constant introduction of <span
class="Greek"><span id="xvi.i-p30.4"></span>πρόνοια</span>, which Mr.
Gwatkin has understated, is a marked feature of the *Vita*. But I am not
prepared to say that Athanasius could not speak in this way. The word is
common, and even characteristic, in his writings. A few examples will
support this statement; more will be referred to in the index to this
volume.

id="xvi.i-p35.3"></span>Πατὴρ ἐν τῷ ῾Υιῷ τῶν πάντων τὴν πρόνοιαν

<span id="xvi.i-p36"></span>If each one of these and numberless other
references to Providence is ‘very incidental,’ those in the *Vita* may
surely claim the benefit (whatever that may be) of the same formula.

<span id="xvi.i-p37"></span>The above are the principal materials for a
decision as to the genuineness of the *Vita:* and I do not see how they
can justify any opinion but that stated at the outset. Against the
*Vita* we have certain historical difficulties (intercourse with
Athanasius, peregrini fratres, Balacius), and arguments *ex silentio*, a
kind of evidence seldom conclusive. For it, we have a quite unusual
array of external evidence, including an almost contemporary version,
the absence of any room for its date at a safe distance from its
traditional author, and the many points of contact, as well as the
characteristic differences between the *Vita* and the writings of
Athanasius. Moreover on the kindred question of the origin of
monasticism, Weingarten’s <span id="page_193">p. 193</span> <span
id="xvi.i-Page_193"></span>theory breaks down, and leads him to suicidal
steps in more than one direction. Although, therefore, it is permissible
to keep an open mind on the subject, we must recognise that the
enterprise of the recent assailants of the *Vita* is at present at a
dead halt, that overwhelming probability is against them.

<span id="xvi.i-p38"></span>But if Athanasius wrote the *Vita*, it does
not follow that all its less edifying details are true, nor that its
portraiture is free from subjectivity <span
id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981.md) . At the same time, to the present
writer at least, the lineaments of a genuine man, <span
class="Greek"><span id="xvi.i-p39.2"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xvi.i-p39.3"></span>μοιοπαθοῦς ἡμῖν</span>,
stand out from the story. Doubtless there is idealisation, panegyric, an
absence of sinfulness (Gwatkin, *Studies*, p. 100). But the moderate
value set on miracles (38, 56), the absence of the element of fear from
his religion (42, &c.), his serene courtesy (73) and uniform
cheerfulness (67, 70), the caution against being tempted to excess in
ascetic exercises (25), the ready half-humorous good sense (73, 85) of
the man, are human touches which belong to flesh and blood, not to
hagiographic imagination. But here the question is one of individual
taste. At any rate the *Vita* embodies the best spirit of early
monasticism. It was the pure desire to serve God and fulfil the spirit
of the Gospel that led Antony to part with all that might make the world
precious to him, and to betake himself to his long voluntary martyrdom
of solitude, privation, and prayer. We see nothing but tenderness and
love of men in his character, nothing of the fierce bloodthirsty
fanaticism which in persons like Senuti made fifth-century monasticism a
reproach to the Christian name. Had Antony lived in our time, he might
have felt that the solitary life was a renunciation of the highest
vocation of which man is capable, the ministry to the material and
spiritual needs of others. But it is not given to man to see all aspects
of truth at once and to our bustling, comfort-loving age, even the life
of Antony has its lesson.

<span id="xvi.i-p40"></span>The *Vita* has undoubtedly exercised a
powerful and wide-spread influence. Upon it Jerome modelled his highly
idealised tales of Paul and Hilarion; at Rome and all over the West it
kindled the flame of monastic aspirations; it awoke in Augustine
(*Conf.* viii. *ubi supra*) the resolution to renounce the world and
give himself wholly to God. The *ingens numerus* of Latin manuscripts,
and the imitation of its details in countless monastic biographies,
testify to its popularity in the middle ages. Like monasticism itself,
its good influence was not without alloy; but on the whole we may claim
for it that it tended to stimulate the nobler of the impulses which
underlie the monastic life.

<span id="xvi.i-p41"></span>A few words may be added on the evidence of
the *Vita* as to the form and motive of early monachism. In the Life of
Antony, the stages are (1) ascetics living in the towns and villages,
not withdrawn from society (§§3, 4); (2) solitary monasticism in the
desert, away from human society; and, as the fame of Antony increases,
(3) the formation (§44) of clusters of cells centering round some
natural leader, the *germ* of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.i-p41.1"></span>λαύρα</span> (such as the community of Tabennæ
under Pachomius). Of organised monastic communities the *Vita* tells us
nothing. With regard to the *motive* of the earliest monasticism, this
has been variously sought in (1) the development of the ascetic element
present in Christianity from the very first; (2) in the influence of the
Alexandrian School, especially Origen, who again is influenced by the
spirit of revolt against the body and detachment from the world which
characterised neo-Platonism (see Bornemann’s work mentioned above); (3)
in the persecutions, which drove Christians to the desert (Eus. *H. E.*
vi. 42), which some adopted as their home; (4) to the (not necessarily
conscious) imitation of analogous heathen institutions, especially the
societies of <span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.i-p41.2"></span>ἁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.i-p41.3"></span>γνεύοντες</span> which were gathered round or in
the temples of Serapis (Weingarten, *R. E.*, X. 779–785. Revillout, p.
480 n, refers to Zoega, p. 542, for the fact that Pachomius himself was
a monk of Serapis before his forced baptism by his Christian neighbours;
and that after it he continued his ascetic life with no external
difference. (5) To the desire to avoid civil obligations, already marked
in the Rescript of Valens (*Cod. Th.* xii. 1. 63, quidam ignauiæ
sectatores desertis civitatum muneribus, &c.). Of the above motives the
*Vita* gives no support to any but the first, which it directly
confirms, and perhaps indirectly to the second. The date of the *Vita*
depends mainly on the view to be taken of §82, where see note 16.
