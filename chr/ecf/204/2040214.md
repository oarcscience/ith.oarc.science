<span id="xvi.ii.iii-p1"></span>1. Antony you must know was by descent
an Egyptian: his parents were of good family and possessed considerable
wealth <span id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984) , and as they were
Christians he also was reared in the same Faith. In infancy he was
brought up with his parents, knowing nought else but them and his home.
But when he was grown and arrived at boyhood, and was advancing in
years, he could not endure to learn <span
id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985) letters, not caring to associate with
other boys; but all his desire was, as it is written of Jacob, to live a
plain man at home <span id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986) . With his
parents he used to attend the Lord’s House, and neither as a child was
he idle nor when older did he despise them; but was both obedient to his
father and mother and attentive to what was read, keeping in his heart
what was profitable in what he heard. And though as a child brought up
in moderate affluence, he did not trouble his parents for varied or
<span id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii-Page_196"></span>luxurious fare, nor was this a source of
pleasure to him; but was content simply with what he found nor sought
anything further.

<span id="xvi.ii.iii-p5"></span>2. After the death of his father and
mother he was left alone with one little sister: his age was about
eighteen or twenty, and on him the care both of home and sister rested.
Now it was not six months after the death of his parents, and going
according to custom into the Lord’s House, he communed with himself and
reflected as he walked how the Apostles <span
id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987) left all and followed the Saviour; and
how they in the Acts <span id="fr_988"></span>[989](#fn_988) sold their
possessions and brought and laid them at the Apostles’ feet for
distribution to the needy, and what and how great a hope was laid up for
them in heaven. Pondering over these things he entered the church, and
it happened the Gospel was being read, and he heard the Lord saying to
the rich man <span id="fr_989"></span>[990](#fn_989) , ‘If thou wouldest
be perfect, go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor; and come
follow Me and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.’ Antony, as though God
had put him in mind of the Saints, and the passage had been read on his
account, went out immediately from the church, and gave the possessions
of his forefathers to the villagers—they were three hundred acres <span
id="fr_990"></span>[991](#fn_990) , productive and very fair—that they
should be no more a clog upon himself and his sister <span
id="fr_991"></span>[992](#fn_991) . And all the rest that was movable he
sold, and having got together much money he gave it to the poor,
reserving a little however for his sister’s sake.
