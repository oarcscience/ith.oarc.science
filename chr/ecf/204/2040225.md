<span id="xvi.ii.xiv-p1"></span> 46. After this the Church was seized by
the persecution which then <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087)
took place under Maximinus, and when the holy martyrs were led to
Alexandria, Antony also followed, leaving his cell, and saying, Let us
go too, that if called, we may contend or behold them that are
contending. And he longed to suffer martyrdom, but not being willing to
give himself up, he ministered to the confessors in the mines and in the
prisons. And he was very zealous in the judgment hall to stir up to
readiness those who were summoned when in their contest, while those who
were being martyred he received and brought on their way until they were
perfected. The judge, therefore, beholding the fearlessness of Antony
and his companions, and their zeal in this matter, commanded that no
monk should appear in the judgment hall, nor remain at all in the city.
So all the rest thought it good to hide themselves that day, but Antony
gave so little heed to the command that he washed his garment, and stood
all next day on a raised place before them, and appeared in his best
before the governor. Therefore when all the rest wondered at this, and
the governor saw and passed by with his array, he stood fearlessly,
shewing the readiness of us Christians. For, as I said before, he prayed
himself to be a martyr, wherefore he seemed as one grieved that he had
not borne his witness. But the Lord was keeping him for our profit and
that of others, that he should become a teacher to many of the
discipline which he had learned from the Scriptures. For many only
beholding his manner of life were eager to be imitators <span

ways. So he again ministered as usual to the confessors, and as though
he were their fellow captive he laboured in his ministry.
