<span id="vi.ii.iii.xi-p1"></span> §45. <span class="c10"><span
id="vi.ii.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Conclusion</span>. *Doctrine of Scripture
on the subject of Part I*.

<span id="vi.ii.iii.xi-p2"></span>For just as by looking up to the
heaven and seeing its order and the light of the stars, it is possible
to infer the Word Who ordered these things, so by beholding the Word of
God, one needs must behold also God His Father, proceeding from Whom He
is rightly called His Father’s Interpreter and Messenger. 2. And this
one may see from our own experience; for if when a word proceeds from
men <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172) we infer that the mind is
its source, and, by thinking about the word, see with our reason the
mind which it reveals, by far greater evidence and incomparably more,
seeing the power of the Word, we receive a knowledge also of His good
Father, as the Saviour Himself says, “He that hath seen Me hath seen the
Father <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173) .” But this all inspired
Scripture also teaches more plainly and with more authority, so that we
in our turn write boldly to you as we do, and you, if you refer to them,
will be able to verify what we say. 3. For an argument when confirmed by
higher authority is irresistibly proved. From the first then the divine
Word firmly taught the Jewish people about the abolition of idols when
it said <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174) : “Thou shalt not make
to thyself a graven image, nor the likeness of anything that is in the
heaven above or in the earth beneath.” But the cause of their abolition
another writer declares <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175) ,
saying: “The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the works of
men’s hands: a mouth have they and will not speak, eyes have they and
will not see, ears have they and will not hear, noses have they and will
not smell, hands have they and will not handle, feet have they and will
not walk.” Nor has it passed over in silence the doctrine of creation;
but, knowing well its beauty, lest any attending solely to this beauty
should worship things as if they were gods, instead of God’s works, it
teaches men firmly beforehand when it says <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176) : “And do not when thou lookest up
with thine eyes and seest the sun and moon and all the host of heaven,
go astray and worship them, which the Lord thy God hath given to all
nations under heaven.” But He gave them, not to be their gods, but that
by their agency the Gentiles should know, as we have said, God the Maker
of them all. 4. For the people of the Jews of old had abundant teaching,
in that they had the knowledge of God not only from the works of
Creation, but also from the divine Scriptures. And in general to draw
men away from the error and irrational imagination of idols, He
saith <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177) : “Thou shalt have none
other gods but Me.” Not as if there were other gods does He forbid them
to have them, but lest any, turning from the true God, should begin to
make himself gods of what were not, such as those who in the poets and
writers are called gods, though they are none. And the language itself
shews that they are no Gods, when it says, “Thou shalt have none other
gods,” which refers only to the future. But what is referred to the
future does not exist at the time of speaking.
