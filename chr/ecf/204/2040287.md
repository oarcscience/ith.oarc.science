<span id="xviii.ii.xxii-p1"></span> 22. *Arrivals of Diogenes and of
Syrianus.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xxii-p2"></span>After a period of six and twenty
months, when Montanus had gone away, there came Diogenes the
Notary <span id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350) ; but he brought me no
letter, nor did we see each other, nor did he charge me with any
commands as from you. Moreover when the General Syrianus entered
Alexandria <span id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351) , seeing that
certain reports were spread abroad by the Arians, who declared that
matters would now be as they wished, I enquired whether he had brought
any letters on the subject of these statements of theirs. I confess that
I asked for letters containing your commands. And when he said that he
had brought none, I requested that Syrianus himself, or Maximus the
Prefect of Egypt, would write to me concerning this matter. Which
request I made, because your Grace has written <span id="page_247">p.
247</span> <span id="xviii.ii.xxii-Page_247"></span>to me, desiring that
I would not suffer myself to be alarmed by any one, nor attend to those
who wished to frighten me, but that I would continue to reside in the
Churches without fear. It was Palladius, the Master of the Palace, and
Asterius, formerly Duke of Armenia, who brought me this letter. Permit
me to read a copy of it. It is as follows:
