<span id="vii.ii.xxxiii-Page_54"></span>§33. *Unbelief of Jews and
scoffing of Greeks. The former confounded by their own Scriptures.
Prophecies of His coming as God and as Man.*

<span id="vii.ii.xxxiii-p2"></span>These things being so, and the
Resurrection of His body and the victory gained over death by the
Saviour being clearly proved, come now let us put to rebuke both the
disbelief of the Jews and the scoffing of the Gentiles. 2. For these,
perhaps, are the points where Jews express incredulity, while Gentiles
laugh, finding fault with the unseemliness of the Cross, and of the Word
of God becoming man. But our argument shall not delay to grapple with
both especially as the proofs at our command against them are clear as
day. 3. For Jews in their incredulity may be refuted from the
Scriptures, which even themselves read; for this text and that, and, in
a word, the whole inspired Scripture, cries aloud concerning these
things, as even its express words abundantly shew. For prophets
proclaimed beforehand concerning the wonder of the Virgin and the birth
from her, saying: “Lo, the <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281)
Virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall
call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.” 4.
But Moses, the truly great, and whom they believe to speak truth, with
reference to the Saviour’s becoming man, having estimated what was said
as important, and assured of its truth, set it down in these words:
“There <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282) shall rise a star out of
Jacob, and a man out of Israel, and he shall break in pieces the
captains of Moab.” And again: “How lovely are thy habitations O Jacob,
thy tabernacles O Israel, as shadowing gardens, and as parks by the
rivers, and as tabernacles which the Lord hath fixed, as cedars by the
waters. A man shall come forth out of his seed, and shall be Lord over
many peoples.” And again, Esaias: “Before <span
id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283) the Child know how to call father or
mother, he shall take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria
before the king of Assyria.” 5. That a man, then, shall appear is
foretold in those words. But that He that is to come is Lord of all,
they predict once more as follows: “Behold <span
id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284) the Lord sitteth upon a light cloud,
and shall come into Egypt, and the graven images of Egypt shall be
shaken.” For from thence also it is that the Father calls Him back,
saying: “I called <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285) My Son out of
Egypt.”
