<span id="xx.ii.iii"></span>

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c8"><span
id="xx.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Part III.</span>

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c40"><span
id="xx.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>Restoration of the Catholics on the Council
of Sardica</span>

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p3"></span>15. While they were proceeding in like
measures towards all, at Rome about fifty Bishops assembled <span
id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md) , and denounced Eusebius and his
fellows as persons suspected, afraid to come, and also condemned as
unworthy of credit the written statement they had sent; but us they
received, and gladly embraced our communion. While these things were
taking place, a report of the Council held at Rome, and of the
proceedings against the Churches at Alexandria, and through all the
East, came to the hearing of the Emperor Constans <span
id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555.md) . He writes to his brother
Constantius, and immediately they both determine <span
id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556.md) that a Council shall be called, and
matters be brought to a settlement, so that those who had been injured
may be released from further suffering, and the injurious be no longer
able to perpetrate such outrages. Accordingly there assemble at the city
of Sardica both from the East and West to the number of one hundred and
seventy Bishops <span id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md) , more or
less; those who came from the West were Bishops only, having Hosius for
their father, but those from the East brought with them instructors of
youth and advocates, Count Musonianus, and Hesychius <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558.md) the Castrensian; on whose account
they came with great alacrity, thinking that everything would be again
managed by their authority. For thus by means of these persons they have
always shewn themselves formidable to any whom they wished to
intimidate, and have prosecuted their designs against whomsoever they
chose. But when they arrived and saw that the cause was to be conducted
as simply an ecclesiastical one, without the interference of the Count
or of soldiers; when they saw the accusers who came from every church
and city, and the evidence which was brought against them, when they saw
the venerable Bishops Arius and Asterius <span
id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559.md) , who came up in their company,
withdrawing from them and siding with us <span
id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560.md) , and giving an account of their
cunning, and how suspicious their conduct was, and that they were
fearing the consequences of a trial, lest they should be con<span
id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span id="xx.ii.iii-Page_275"></span>victed
by us of being false informers, and it should be discovered by those
whom they produced in the character of accusers, that they had
themselves suggested all they were to say, and were the contrivers of
the plot. Perceiving this to be the case, although they had come with
great zeal, as thinking that we should be afraid to meet them, yet now
when they saw our alacrity, they shut themselves up in the Palace <span
id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561) (for they had their abode there.md),
and proceeded to confer with one another in the following manner: ‘We
came hither for one result; and we see another; we arrived in company
with Counts, and the trial is proceeding without them. We are certainly
condemned. You all know the orders that have been given. Athanasius and
his fellows have the reports of the proceedings in the Mareotis <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md) , by which he is cleared, and we
are covered with disgrace. Why then do we delay? why are we so slow? Let
us invent some excuse and be gone, or we shall be condemned if we
remain. It is better to suffer the shame of fleeing, than the disgrace
of being convicted as false accusers. If we flee, we shall find some
means of defending our heresy; and even if they condemn us for our
flight, still we have the Emperor as our patron, who will not suffer the
people to expel us from the Churches.’

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p13"></span>16. *Secession of the Easterns at
Sardica.*

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p14"></span>Thus then they reasoned with themselves
and Hosius and all the other Bishops repeatedly signified to them the
alacrity of Athanasius and his fellows, saying, ‘They are ready with
their defence, and pledge themselves to prove you false accusers.’ They
said also, ‘If you fear the trial, why did you come to meet us? either
you ought not to have come, or now that you have come, not to flee.’
When they heard this, being still more alarmed, they had recourse to an
excuse even more unseemly than that they pretended at Antioch, viz. that
they betook themselves to flight because the Emperor had written to them
the news of his victory over the Persians. And this excuse they were not
ashamed to send by Eustathius a Presbyter of the Sardican Church. But
even thus their flight did not succeed according to their wishes; for
immediately the holy Council, of which the great Hosius was president,
wrote to them plainly, saying, ‘Either come forward and answer the
charges which are brought against you, for the false accusations which
you have made against others, or know that the Council will condemn you
as guilty, and declare Athanasius and his fellows free and clear from
all blame.’ Whereupon they were rather impelled to flight by the alarms
of conscience, than to compliance with the proposals of the letter; for
when they saw those who had been injured by them, they did not even turn
their faces to listen to their words, but fled with greater speed.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p15"></span>17. *Proceedings of the Council of
Sardica.*

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p16"></span>Under these disgraceful and unseemly
circumstances their flight took place. And the holy Council, which had
been assembled out of more than five and thirty provinces, perceiving
the malice of the Arians, admitted Athanasius and his fellows to answer
to the charges which the others had brought against them, and to declare
the sufferings which they had undergone. And when they had thus made
their defence, as we said before, they approved and so highly admired
their conduct that they gladly embraced their communion, and wrote
letters to all quarters, to the diocese of each, and especially to
Alexandria and Egypt, and the Libyas, declaring Athanasius and his
friends to be innocent, and free from all blame, and their opponents to
be calumniators, evil-doers, and everything rather than Christians.
Accordingly they dismissed them in peace; but deposed Stephanus and
Menophantus, Acacius and George of Laodicea, Ursacius and Valens,
Theodorus and Narcissus. For against Gregory, who had been sent to
Alexandria by the Emperor, they put forth a proclamation to the effect
that he had never been made a Bishop, and that he ought not to be called
a Christian. They therefore declared the ordinations which he professed
to have conferred to be void, and commanded that they should not be even
named in the Church, on account of their novel and illegal nature. Thus
Athanasius and his friends were dismissed in peace (the letters
concerning them are inserted at the end on account of their length <span
id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563) .md), and the Council was dissolved.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p18"></span>18. *Arian Persecution after Sardica.*

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p19"></span>But the deposed persons, who ought now
to have remained quiet, with those who had separated after so
disgraceful a flight, were guilty of such conduct, that their former
proceedings appear trifling in comparison of these. For when the people
of Adrianople would not have communion with them, as men who had fled
<span id="page_276">p. 276</span> <span
id="xx.ii.iii-Page_276"></span>from the Council, and had proved
culprits, they carried their complaints to the Emperor Constantius, and
succeeded in causing ten of the laity to be beheaded, belonging to the
Manufactory of arms <span id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md) there,
Philagrius, who was there again as Count, assisting their designs in
this matter also. The tombs of these persons, which we have seen in
passing <span id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md) by, are in front of
the city. Then as if they had been quite successful, because they had
fled lest they should be convicted of false accusation, they prevailed
with the Emperor to command whatsoever they wished to be done. Thus they
caused two Presbyters and three Deacons to be banished from Alexandria
into Armenia. As to Arius and Asterius, the one Bishop of Petræ <span
id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md) in Palestine, the other Bishop in
Arabia, who had withdrawn from their party, they not only banished into
upper Libya, but also caused them to be treated with insult.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p23"></span>19. *Tyrannical measures against the
Alexandrians.*

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p24"></span>And as to Lucius <span
id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md) , Bishop of Adrianople, when they
saw that he used great boldness of speech against them, and exposed
their impiety, they again, as they had done before, caused him to be
bound with iron chains on the neck and hands, and so drove him into
banishment, where he died, as they know. And Diodorus a Bishop <span
id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md) they remove; but against Olympius
of Æni, and Theodulus of Trajanople <span
id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569.md) , both Bishops of Thrace, good and
orthodox men, when they perceived their hatred of the heresy, they
brought false charges. This Eusebius and his fellows had done first of
all, and the Emperor Constantius wrote letters on the subject; and next
these men <span id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570.md) revived the
accusation. The purport of the letter was, that they should not only be
expelled from their cities and churches, but should also suffer capital
punishment, wherever they were discovered. However surprising this
conduct may be, it is only in accordance with their principles; for as
being instructed by Eusebius and his fellows in such proceedings, and as
heirs of their impiety and evil principles, they wished to shew
themselves formidable at Alexandria, as their fathers had done in
Thrace. They caused an order to be written, that the ports and gates of
the cities should be watched, lest availing themselves of the permission
granted by the Council, the banished persons should return to their
churches. They also cause orders to be sent to the magistrates at
Alexandria, respecting Athanasius and certain Presbyters, named therein,
that if either the Bishop <span id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571.md) ,
or any of the others, should be found coming to the city or its borders,
the magistrate should have power to behead those who were so discovered.
Thus this new Jewish heresy does not only deny the Lord, but has also
learnt to commit murder.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p30"></span>20. *Plot against the Catholic Legates
at Antioch.*

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p31"></span>Yet even after this they did not rest;
but as the father of their heresy goeth about like a lion, seeking whom
he may devour, so these obtaining the use of the public posts <span
id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572.md) went about, and whenever they found
any that reproached them with their flight, and that hated the Arian
heresy, they scourged them, cast them into chains, and caused them to be
banished from their country; and they rendered themselves so formidable,
as to induce many to dissemble, many to fly into the deserts, rather
than willingly even to have any dealings with them. Such were the
enormities which their madness prompted them to commit after their
flight. Moreover they perpetrate another outrageous act, which is indeed
in accordance with the character of their heresy, but is such as we
never heard of before, nor is likely soon to take place again, even
among the more dissolute of the Gentiles, much less among Christians.
The holy Council had sent as Legates the Bishops Vincentius <span
id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md) of Capua (this is the Metropolis of
Campania), and Euphrates of Agrippina <span
id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md) (this is the Metropolis of Upper
Gaul), that they might obtain the Emperor’s consent to the decision of
the Council, that the Bishops should return to their Churches, inasmuch
as he was the author of their expulsion. The most religious Constans had
also written to his brother <span id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md) ,
and supported the cause of the Bishops. But these admirable men, who are
equal to any act of audacity, when they saw the two Legates at Antioch,
consulted together and formed a plot, which Stephanus <span
id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md) undertook by himself to execute, as
being a suitable instrument for such purposes. Accordingly they hire a
common harlot, even at the season of the most holy Easter, and stripping
her introduce her by night into the apartment of the Bishop Euphrates.
The harlot who thought that it was a young man who had sent to invite
her, at first willingly accompanied them; but when <span
id="page_277">p. 277</span> <span id="xx.ii.iii-Page_277"></span>they
thrust her in, and she saw the man asleep and unconscious of what was
going on, and when presently she distinguished his features, and beheld
the face of an old man, and the array of a Bishop, she immediately cried
aloud, and declared that violence was used towards her. They desired her
to be silent, and to lay a false charge against the Bishop; and so when
it was day, the matter was noised abroad, and all the city ran together;
and those who came from the Palace were in great commotion, wondering at
the report which had been spread abroad, and demanding that it should
not be passed by in silence. An enquiry, therefore, was made, and her
master gave information concerning those who came to fetch the harlot,
and these informed against Stephanus; for they were his Clergy.
Stephanus, therefore, is deposed <span
id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md) , and Leontius the eunuch appointed
in his place, only that the Arian heresy may not want a supporter.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p38"></span>21. *Constantius’ change of mind.*

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p39"></span>And now the Emperor Constantius, feeling
some compunctions, returned to himself; and concluding from their
conduct towards Euphrates, that their attacks upon the others were of
the same kind, he gives orders that the Presbyters and Deacons who had
been banished from Alexandria into Armenia should immediately be
released. He also writes publicly to Alexandria <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md) , commanding that the clergy and
laity who were friends of Athanasius should suffer no further
persecution. And when Gregory died about ten months <span
id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md) after, he sends for Athanasius with
every mark of honour, writing to him no less than three times a very
friendly letter <span id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md) in which he
exhorted him to take courage and come. He sends also a Presbyter and a
Deacon, that he may be still further encouraged to return; for he
thought that, through alarm at what had taken place before, I <span
id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581.md) did not care to return. Moreover he
writes to his brother Constans, that he also would exhort me to return.
And he affirmed that he had been expecting Athanasius a whole year, and
that he would not permit any change to be made, or any ordination to
take place, as he was preserving the Churches for Athanasius their
Bishop.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p44"></span>22. *Athanasius visits Constantius.*

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p45"></span>When therefore he wrote in this strain,
and encouraged him by means of many (for he caused Polemius, Datianus,
Bardion, Thalassus <span id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582.md) ,
Taurus <span id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583.md) , and Florentius, his
Counts, in whom Athanasius could best confide, to write also):
Athanasius committing the whole matter to God, who had stirred the
conscience of Constantius to do this, came with his friends to him; and
he gave him a favourable audience <span
id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584.md) , and sent him away to go to his
country and his Churches, writing at the same time to the magistrates in
the several places, that whereas he had before commanded the ways to be
guarded, they should now grant him a free passage. Then when the Bishop
complained of the sufferings he had undergone, and of the letters which
the Emperor had written against him, and besought him that the false
accusations against him might not be revived by his enemies after his
departure, saying <span id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585.md) , ‘If you
please, summon these persons; for as far as we are concerned they are at
liberty to stand forth, and we will expose their conduct;’ he would not
do this, but commanded that whatever had been before slanderously
written against him should all be destroyed and obliterated, affirming
that he would never again listen to any such accusations, and that his
purpose was fixed and unalterable. This he did not simply say, but
sealed his words with oaths, calling upon God to be witness of them. And
so encouraging him with many other words, and desiring him to be of good
courage, he sends the following letters to the Bishops and Magistrates.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p50"></span>23. Constantius Augustus, the Great, the
Conqueror, to the Bishops and Clergy of the Catholic Church.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p51"></span>The most Reverend Athanasius has not
been deserted by the grace of God <span
id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586.md) , &c.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p53"></span>Another Letter.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p54"></span>From Constantius to the people of
Alexandria.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p55"></span>Desiring as we do your welfare in all
respects <span id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587.md) , &c.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p57"></span>Another Letter.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p58"></span>Constantius Augustus, the Conqueror, to
Nestorius, Prefect of Egypt.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p59"></span>It is well known that an order was
heretofore given by us, and that certain documents are to be found
prejudicial to the estimation of <span id="page_278">p. 278</span> <span
id="xx.ii.iii-Page_278"></span>the most reverend Bishop Athanasius; and
that these exist among the Orders <span
id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588.md) of your worship. Now we desire your
Sobriety, of which we have good proof, to transmit to our Court, in
compliance with this our order, all the letters respecting the
fore-mentioned person, which are found in your Order-book.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p61"></span>24. The following is the letter which he
wrote after the death of the blessed Constans. It was written in Latin,
and is here translated into Greek <span
id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589.md) .

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p63"></span>Constantius Augustus, the Conqueror, to
Athanasius.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p64"></span>It is not unknown to your Prudence, that
it was my constant prayer, that prosperity might attend my late brother
Constans in all his undertakings; and your wisdom may therefore imagine
how greatly I was afflicted when I learnt that he had been taken off by
most unhallowed hands. Now whereas there are certain persons who at the
present truly mournful time are endeavouring to alarm you, I have
therefore thought it right to address this letter to your Constancy, to
exhort you that, as becomes a Bishop, you would teach the people those
things which pertain to the divine religion, and that, as you are
accustomed to do, you would employ your time in prayers together with
them, and not give credit to vain rumours, whatever they may be. For our
fixed determination is, that you should continue, agreeably to our
desire, to perform the office of a Bishop in your own place. May Divine
Providence preserve you, most beloved parent, many years.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p65"></span>25. *Return of Athanasius from second
exile.*

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p66"></span>Under these circumstances, when they had
at length taken their leave, and begun their journey, those who were
friendly rejoiced to see a friend; but of the other party, some were
confounded at the sight of him; others not having the confidence to
appear, hid themselves; and others repented of what they had written
against the Bishop. Thus all the Bishops of Palestine <span
id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590.md) , except some two or three, and
those men of suspected character, so willingly received Athanasius, and
embraced communion with him, that they wrote to excuse themselves, on
the ground that in what they had formerly written, they had acted, not
according to their own wishes, but by compulsion. Of the Bishops of
Egypt and the Libyan provinces, of the laity both of those countries and
of Alexandria, it is superfluous for me to speak. They all ran <span
id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591.md) together, and were possessed with
unspeakable delight, that they had not only received their friends alive
contrary to their hopes; but that they were also delivered from the
heretics who were as tyrants and as raging dogs towards them.
Accordingly great was their joy <span
id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592.md) , the people in the congregations
encouraging one another in virtue. How many unmarried women, who were
before ready to enter upon marriage, now remained virgins to Christ! How
many young men, seeing the examples of others, embraced the monastic
life! How many fathers persuaded their children, and how many were urged
by their children, not to be hindered from Christian asceticism! How
many wives persuaded their husbands, and how many were persuaded by
their husbands, to give themselves to prayer <span
id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593.md) , as the Apostle has spoken! How
many widows and how many orphans, who were before hungry and naked, now
through the great zeal of the people, were no longer hungry, and went
forth clothed! In a word, so great was their emulation in virtue, that
you would have thought every family and every house a Church, by reason
of the goodness of its inmates, and the prayers which were offered to
God. And in the Churches there was a profound and wonderful peace, while
the Bishops wrote from all quarters, and received from Athanasius the
customary letters of peace.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p71"></span>26. *Recantation of Ursacius and
Valens.*

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p72"></span>Moreover Ursacius and Valens, as if
suffering the scourge of conscience, came to another mind, and wrote to
the Bishop himself a friendly and peaceable letter <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594.md) , although they had received no
communication from him. And going up to Rome they repented, and
confessed that all their proceedings and assertions against him were
founded in falsehood and mere calumny. And they not only voluntarily did
this, but also anathematized the Arian heresy, and presented a written
declaration of their repentance, addressing to the Bishop Julius the
following letter in Latin, which has been translated into Greek. The
copy was sent to us in Latin by Paul <span
id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595.md) , Bishop of Treveri.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p75"></span>Translation from the Latin.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p76"></span>Ursacius and Valens to my Lord the most
blessed Pope Julius.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p77"></span>Whereas it is well known that we <span
id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596.md) , &c.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p79"></span>Translation from the Latin.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p80"></span>The Bishops Ursacius and Valens to my
Lord and Brother, the Bishop Athanasius.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p81"></span>Having an opportunity of sending <span
id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597.md) , &c.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p83"></span><span id="page_279">p. 279</span> <span
id="xx.ii.iii-Page_279"></span>After writing these, they also subscribed
the letters of peace which were presented to them by Peter and Irenæus,
Presbyters of Athanasius, and by Ammonius a layman, who were passing
that way, although Athanasius had sent no communication to them even by
these persons.

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p84"></span>27. *Triumph of Athanasius.*

<span id="xx.ii.iii-p85"></span>Now who was not filled with admiration
at witnessing these things, and the great peace that prevailed in the
Churches? who did not rejoice to see the concord of so many Bishops? who
did not glorify the Lord, beholding the delight of the people in their
assemblies? How many enemies repented! How many excused themselves who
had formerly accused him falsely! How many who formerly hated him, now
shewed affection for him! How many of those who had written against him,
recanted their assertions? Many also who had sided with the Arians, not
through choice but by necessity, came by night and excused themselves.
They anathematized the heresy, and besought him to pardon them, because,
although through the plots and calumnies of these men they appeared
bodily on their side, yet in their hearts they held communion with
Athanasius, and were always with him. Believe me, this is true.

were one of the four public works mentioned in the Laws. ibid. XV. i.

Prætorium, VII. x. 2. Gothofr. in VII. x. 1 enumerates (with references)
the Palatia in Antioch, Daphne, Constantinople, Hereclea, Milan, Treves,
&c. It was a great mark then of imperial favour that the Eastern bishops
were accommodated in the Palatium at Sardica.

some at least of the letters at Aquileia, where he spent Easter, 345
(*Apol. Ar.* 51, *Fest. Ind*. xvii.). He then went to see Constans at
Treveri, apparently in May, 346 (*Apol. Const.* 4, Gwatkin, Stud. 127,
n.). This compels us to assume that the first invitation to Ath. to
return must have been wrung (*infr.* 49, 50) from Constantius before the
death of Gregory. The statement in the text is therefore so far inexact,
but the lung illness of Gregory must have made his death a matter of
daily expectation, cf. Prolegg. ch. ii. §6 (3) fin.\]
