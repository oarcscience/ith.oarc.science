<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-Page_575"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Letter LX</span>.—*To Adelphius <span
id="fr_4737"></span>[4738](#fn_4737.md) , Bishop and Confessor: against the
Arians.*

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-p3.1"></span>We</span> have read what your piety has
written to us, and genuinely approve your piety toward Christ. And above
all we glorify God, Who has given you such grace as not only to have
right opinions, but also, so far as that is possible, not to be ignorant
of the devices <span id="fr_4738"></span>[4739](#fn_4738.md) of the devil.
But we marvel at the perversity of the heretics, seeing that they have
fallen into such a pit of impiety that they no longer retain even their
senses, but have their understanding corrupted on all sides. But this
attempt is a plot of the devil, and an imitation of the disobedient
Jews. For as the latter, when refuted on all sides, kept devising
excuses to their own hurt, if only they could deny the Lord and bring
upon themselves what was prophesied against them, in like manner these
men, seeing themselves proscribed on all hands, and perceiving that
their heresy has become abominable to all, prove themselves ‘inventors
of evil things <span id="fr_4739"></span>[4740](#fn_4739.md) ,’ in order
that, not ceasing their fightings against the truth, they may remain
consistent and genuine adversaries of Christ. For whence has this new
mischief of theirs sprung forth? How have they even ventured to utter
this new blasphemy against the Saviour? But the impious man, it seems,
is a worthless object, and truly ‘reprobate concerning the Faith <span
id="fr_4740"></span>[4741](#fn_4740.md) .’ For formerly, while denying the
Godhead of the only-begotten Son of God, they pretended at any rate to
acknowledge His coming in the Flesh. But now, gradually going from bad
to worse, they have fallen from this opinion of theirs, and become
Godless on all hands, so as neither to acknowledge Him as God, nor to
believe that He has become man. For if they believed this they would not
have uttered such things as your piety has reported against them.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-p7"></span>2. You, however, beloved and most
truly longed-for, have done what befitted the tradition of the Church
and your piety toward the Lord, in refuting, admonishing, and rebuking
such men. But since, instigated by their father the devil, ‘they knew
not nor understood,’ as it is written, ‘but go on still in
darkness <span id="fr_4741"></span>[4742](#fn_4741.md) ,’ let them learn
from your piety that this error of theirs belongs to Valentinus and
Marcion, and to Manichæus, of whom some substituted \[the idea of\]
Appearance for Reality, while the others, dividing what is indivisible,
denied the truth that ‘the Word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us <span
id="fr_4742"></span>[4743](#fn_4742.md) .’ Why then, as they hold with
those people, do they not also take up the heritage of their names? For
it is reasonable, as they hold their error, to have their names as well,
and for the future to be called Valentinians, Marcionists, and
Manichæans. Perhaps even thus, being put to shame by the ill savour of
the names, they may be enabled to perceive into what a depth of impiety
they have fallen. And it would be within our rights not to answer them
at all, according to the apostolic advice <span
id="fr_4743"></span>[4744](#fn_4743.md) : ‘A man that is heretical, after a
first and second admonition refuse, knowing that such an one is
perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned;’ the more so, in that the
Prophet says about such men: ‘The fool shall utter foolishness, and his
heart shall imagine vain things <span
id="fr_4744"></span>[4745](#fn_4744.md) .’ But since, like their leader,
they too go about like lions seeking whom among the simple they shall
devour <span id="fr_4745"></span>[4746](#fn_4745.md) , we are compelled to
write in reply to your piety, that the brethren being once again
instructed by your admonition may still further reprobate the vain
teaching of those men.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-p13"></span>3. We do not worship a creature. Far
be the thought. For such an error belongs to heathens and Arians. But we
worship the Lord of Creation, Incarnate, the Word of God. For if the
flesh also is in itself a part of the created world, yet it has become
God’s body. And we neither divide the body, being such, from the Word,
and worship it by itself <span id="fr_4746"></span>[4747](#fn_4746.md) ,
nor when we wish to worship the Word do we set Him far apart from the
Flesh, but knowing, as we said above, that ‘the Word was made flesh,’ we
recognise Him as God also, after having come in the flesh. Who,
accordingly, is so senseless as to say to the Lord: ‘Leave the Body that
I may worship Thee;’ or so impious as to join the senseless Jews in
saying, on account of the Body, ‘Why dost Thou, being a man, make
Thyself God <span id="fr_4747"></span>[4748](#fn_4747.md) ?’ But the leper
was not one of this sort, for he worshipped God in the Body, and
recognised that He was God, saying, ‘Lord, if Thou wilt Thou canst make
me clean <span id="fr_4748"></span>[4749](#fn_4748.md) .’ Neither by reason
of the Flesh did <span id="page_576">p. 576</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-Page_576"></span>he think the Word of God a creature:
nor because the Word was the maker of all creation did he despise the
Flesh which He had put on. But he worshipped the Creator of the universe
as dwelling in a created temple, and was cleansed. So also the woman
with an issue of blood, who believed, and only touched the hem of His
garment, was healed <span id="fr_4749"></span>[4750](#fn_4749.md) , and the
sea with its foaming waves heard the incarnate Word, and ceased its
storm <span id="fr_4750"></span>[4751](#fn_4750.md) , while the man blind
from birth was healed by the fleshly spitting of the Word <span
id="fr_4751"></span>[4752](#fn_4751.md) . And, what is greater and more
startling (for perhaps this even offended those most impious men), even
when the Lord was hanging upon the actual cross (for it was His Body and
the Word was in it), the sun was darkened and the earth shook, the rocks
were rent, and the vail of the temple rent, and many bodies of the
saints which slept arose.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-p20"></span>4. These things then happened, and
no one doubted, as the Arians now venture to doubt, whether one is to
believe the incarnate Word; but even from beholding the man, they
recognised that He was their maker, and when they heard a human voice,
they did not, because it was human, say that the Word was a creature. On
the contrary, they trembled, and recognised nothing less than that it
was being uttered from a holy Temple. How then can the impious fail to
fear lest ‘as they refused to have God in their knowledge, they may be
given up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not
fitting <span id="fr_4752"></span>[4753](#fn_4752.md) ?’ For Creation does
not worship a creature. Nor again did she on account of His Flesh refuse
to worship her Lord. But she beheld her maker in the Body, and ‘in the
Name of Jesus every knee’ bowed, yea and ‘shall bow, of things in heaven
and things on earth and things under the earth, and every tongue shall
confess,’ whether the Arians approve or no, ‘that Jesus is Lord, to the
Glory of God the Father <span id="fr_4753"></span>[4754](#fn_4753.md) .’
For the Flesh did not diminish the glory of the Word; far be the
thought: on the contrary, it was glorified by Him. Nor, because the Son
that was in the form of God took upon Him the form of a servant <span
id="fr_4754"></span>[4755](#fn_4754.md) was He deprived of His Godhead. On
the contrary, He is thus become the Deliverer of all flesh and of all
creation. And if God sent His Son brought forth from a woman, the fact
causes us no shame but contrariwise glory and great grace. For He has
become Man, that He might deify us in Himself, and He has been born of a
woman, and begotten of a Virgin, in order to transfer to Himself our
erring generation <span id="fr_4755"></span>[4756](#fn_4755.md) , and that
we may become henceforth a holy race, and ‘partakers of the Divine
Nature,’ as blessed Peter wrote <span
id="fr_4756"></span>[4757](#fn_4756.md) . And ‘what the law could not do in
that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the
likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh <span
id="fr_4757"></span>[4758](#fn_4757.md) .’

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-p27"></span>5. Seeing then that Flesh was taken
by the Word to deliver all men, raise all from the dead, and make
redemption for sins, must not they appear ungrateful, and be worthy of
all hatred, who make light of the Flesh, as well as those who on account
of it charge the Son of God with being a thing created or made? For they
as good as cry to God and say: ‘Send not Thine Only-begotten Son in the
Flesh, cause Him not to take flesh of a virgin, lest He redeem us from
death and sin. We do not wish Him to come in the body, lest He should
undergo death on our behalf: we do not desire the Word to be made flesh,
lest in it He should become our Mediator to gain access to thee, and we
so inhabit the heavenly mansions. Let the gates of the heavens be shut
lest Thy Word consecrate for us the road thither through the veil,
namely His Flesh <span id="fr_4758"></span>[4759](#fn_4758.md) .’ These are
their utterances, vented with diabolical daring, by the error they have
devised. For they who do not wish to worship the Word made flesh, are
ungrateful for His becoming man. And they who divide the Word from the
Flesh do not hold that one redemption from sin has taken place, or one
destruction of death. But where at all will these impious men find the
Flesh which the Saviour took, apart from Him, that they should even
venture to say ‘we do not worship the Lord with the Flesh, but we
separate the Body, and worship Him alone.’ Why, the blessed Stephen saw
in the heavens the Lord standing on \[God’s\] right hand <span
id="fr_4759"></span>[4760](#fn_4759.md) , while the Angels said to the
disciples, ‘He shall so come in like manner as ye beheld Him going into
heaven <span id="fr_4760"></span>[4761](#fn_4760.md) :’ and the Lord
Himself says, addressing the Father, ‘I will that where I am, they also
may be with Me <span id="fr_4761"></span>[4762](#fn_4761.md) .’ And surely
if the Flesh is inseparable from the Word, does it not follow that these
men must either lay aside their error, and for the future worship the
Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, or, if they do not worship
or serve the Word Who came in the Flesh, be cast out on all sides, and
count no longer as Christians but either as heathens, or among the Jews.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-p32"></span>6. Such then, as we have above
described, is the madness and daring of those men. But our faith is
right, and starts from the teaching <span id="page_577">p. 577</span>
<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-Page_577"></span>of the Apostles and tradition
of the fathers, being confirmed both by the New Testament and the Old.
For the Prophets say: ‘Send out Thy Word and Thy Truth <span
id="fr_4762"></span>[4763](#fn_4762.md) ,’ and ‘Behold the Virgin shall
conceive and bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is
being interpreted God with us <span id="fr_4763"></span>[4764](#fn_4763.md)
.’ But what does that mean, if not that God has come in the Flesh? While
the Apostolic tradition teaches in the words of blessed Peter,
‘Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the Flesh;’ and in what
Paul writes, ‘Looking for the blessed hope and appearing of our great
God and Saviour Jesus Christ, Who gave Himself for us that He might
redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a people for His
own possession, and zealous of good works <span
id="fr_4764"></span>[4765](#fn_4764.md) .’ How then has He given Himself,
if He had not worn flesh? For flesh He offered, and gave Himself for us,
in order that undergoing death in it, ‘He might bring to nought him that
had the power of death, that is, the devil <span
id="fr_4765"></span>[4766](#fn_4765.md) .’ Hence also we always give thanks
in the name of Jesus Christ, and we do not set at nought the grace which
came to us through Him. For the coming of the Saviour in the flesh has
been the ransom and salvation of all creation. So then, beloved and most
longed-for, let what I have said put in mind those who love the Lord,
while as to those who have imitated the behaviour of Judas, and deserted
the Lord to join Caiaphas, let them by these things be taught better, if
maybe they are willing, if maybe they are ashamed. And let them know
that in worshipping the Lord in the flesh we do not worship a creature,
but, as we said above, the Creator Who has put on the created body.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-p37"></span>7. But we should like your piety to
ask them this. When Israel was ordered to go up to Jerusalem to worship
at the temple of the Lord, where was the ark, ‘and above it the Cherubim
of glory overshadowing the Mercy-seat <span
id="fr_4766"></span>[4767](#fn_4766.md) ,’ did they do well or the
opposite? If they did ill, how came it that they who despised this law
were liable to punishment? for it is written that if a man make light of
it and go not up, he shall perish from among the people <span
id="fr_4767"></span>[4768](#fn_4767.md) . But if they did well, and in this
proved well-pleasing to God, are not the Arians, abominable and most
shameful of any heresy, many times worthy of destruction, in that while
they approve the former People for the honour paid by them to the
Temple, they will not worship the Lord Who is in the flesh as in a
temple? And yet the former temple was constructed of stones and gold, as
a shadow. But when the reality came, the type ceased from thenceforth,
and there did not remain, according to the Lord’s utterance, one stone
upon another that was not broken down <span
id="fr_4768"></span>[4769](#fn_4768.md) . And they did not, when they saw
the temple of stones, suppose that the Lord who spoke in the temple was
a creature; nor did they set the Temple at nought and retire far off to
worship. But they came to it according to the Law, and worshipped the
God who uttered His oracles from the Temple. Since then this was so, how
can it be other than right to worship the Body of the Lord, all-holy and
all-reverend as it is, announced as it was by the archangel Gabriel,
formed by the Holy Spirit, and made the Vesture of the Word? It was at
any rate a bodily hand that the Word stretched out to raise her that was
sick of a fever <span id="fr_4769"></span>[4770](#fn_4769.md) : a human
voice that He uttered to raise Lazarus from the dead <span
id="fr_4770"></span>[4771](#fn_4770.md) ; and, once again, stretching out
His hands upon the Cross, He overthrew the prince of the power of the
air, that now works <span id="fr_4771"></span>[4772](#fn_4771.md) in the
sons of disobedience, and made the way clear for us into the heavens.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-p44"></span>8. Therefore he that dishonours the
Temple dishonours the Lord in the Temple; and he that separates the Word
from the Body sets at nought the grace given to us in Him. And let not
the most impious Arian madmen suppose that, since the Body is created,
the Word also is a creature, nor let them, because the Word is not a
creature, disparage His Body. For their error is matter for wonder, in
that they at once confuse and disturb everything, and devise pretexts
only in order to number the Creator among the creatures.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-p45"></span>But let them listen. If the Word
were a creature, He would not assume the created body to quicken it. For
what help can creatures derive from a creature that itself needs
salvation? But since the Word being Creator has Himself made the
creatures, therefore also at the consummation of the ages <span
id="fr_4772"></span>[4773](#fn_4772.md) He put on the creature, that He as
creator might once more consecrate it, and be able to recover it. But a
creature could never be saved by a creature, any more than the creatures
were created by a creature, if the Word was not creator. Accordingly let
them not lie against the divine Scriptures nor give offence to simple
brethren; but if they are willing let them change their mind in their
turn, and no longer worship the creature instead of God, Who made all
things. But if they wish to abide by their impieties, let them alone
take their fill of them, and let them gnash their teeth like their <span
id="page_578">p. 578</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-Page_578"></span>father the devil, because the Faith
of the Catholic Church knows that the Word of God is creator and maker
of all things; and we know that while ‘in the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God <span id="fr_4773"></span>[4774](#fn_4773.md) ,’
now that He has become also man for our salvation we worship Him, not as
though He had come in the body equalising Himself with it, but as
Master, assuming the form of the servant, and Maker and Creator coming
in a creature in order that, in it delivering all things, He might bring
the world nigh to the Father, and make all things to be at peace, things
in heaven and things on the earth. For thus also we recognise His
Godhead, even the Father’s, and worship His Incarnate Presence, even if
the Arian madmen burst themselves in sunder.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-p48"></span>Greet all that love the Lord Jesus
Christ. We pray that you may be well, and remember us to the Lord,
beloved and truly most longed-for. If need be this is to be read to
Hieracas <span id="fr_4774"></span>[4775](#fn_4774.md) the presbyter.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xv-p2"></span> Adelphius is named in the ‘Tome’
(above, p. 486), as bishop of Onuphis. Previously he had been exiled by
the Arians to the Thebaid (above, pp. 297, &c.). Hence in the title of
this letter he is styled ‘Confessor.’ The letter (Migne xxvi, 1072) is
directed against the Arian Christology. Although Ath. treats it (§1) as
a ‘*new* blasphemy,’ it had been held by the Arians from the first;
Epiph. *Anc.* 33, traces it back to Lucian; but doubtless it had by this
time been brought more to the front in their teaching. We know that it
occupied a prominent place in the Eunomian system. (References in Dorner
III. i. 3.) After briefly refuting the doctrinal error, Athanasius turns
to the Arian charge of creature-worship brought against the Nicene
doctrine. Not forgetting to remind them that their own doctrine was
really open to this charge, Ath. points out at greater length that the
object of Catholic worship is not the human nature of Christ as such,
but the Word Incarnate; and that the human Saviour is worshipped because
He is the Word Himself. The date proposed by Montfaucon is adopted,
though there is nothing to fix it absolutely. Its style closely
resembles that of the writings of the ‘third Exile.’ (See also Bright,
*Later Tr*., p. 61.)
