continued training himself in solitude, never going forth, and but
seldom seen by any. After this, when many were eager and wishful to
imitate his discipline, and his acquaintances came and began to cast
down and wrench off the door by force, Antony, as from a shrine, came
forth initiated in the mysteries and filled with the Spirit of God. Then
for the first time he was seen outside the fort by those who came to see
him. And they, when they saw him, wondered at the sight, for he had the
same habit of body as before, and was neither fat, like a man without
exercise, nor lean from fasting and striving with the demons, but he was
just the same as they had known him before his retirement. And again his
soul was free from blemish, for it was neither contracted as if by
grief, nor relaxed by pleasure, nor possessed by laughter or dejection,
for he was not troubled when he beheld the crowd, nor overjoyed at being
saluted by so many. But he was altogether even as being guided by
reason, and abiding in a natural state. Through him the Lord healed the
bodily ailments of many present, and cleansed others from evil spirits.
And He gave grace to Antony in speaking, so that he consoled many that
were sorrowful, and set those at variance at one, exhorting all to
prefer the love of Christ before all that is in the world. And while he
exhorted and advised them to remember the good things to come, and the
loving-kindness of God towards us, ‘Who spared not His own Son, but
delivered Him up for us all <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1017](#fn_1016)
,’ he persuaded many to embrace the solitary life. And thus it happened
in the end that cells arose even in the mountains, and the desert was
colonised by monks, who came forth from their own people, and enrolled
themselves for the citizenship in the heavens.

<span id="xvi.ii.x-p3"></span>15. But when he was obliged to cross the
Arsenoitic Canal <span id="fr_1017"></span>[1018](#fn_1017) —and the
occasion of it was the visitation of the brethren—the canal was full of
crocodiles. And by simply praying, he entered it, and all they with him,
and passed over in safety. And having returned to his cell, he applied
himself to the same noble and valiant exercises; and by frequent
conversation he increased the eagerness of those already monks, stirred
up in most of the rest the love of the discipline, and speedily by the
attraction of his words cells multiplied, and he directed them all as a
father.
