<span id="xix.ii.xxii-p2"></span>Thus the Saints, as I said before, were
abundantly preserved in their flight by the Providence of God, as
physicians for the sake of them that had need. And to all men generally,
even to us, is this law given, to flee when persecuted, and to hide when
sought after, and not rashly tempt the Lord, but wait, as I said above,
until the appointed time of death arrive, or the Judge determine
something concerning them, according as it shall seem to Him to be good:
that men should be ready, that, when the time calls, or when they are
taken, they may contend for the truth even unto death. This rule the
blessed Martyrs observed in their several persecutions. When persecuted
they fled, while concealing themselves they shewed fortitude, and when
discovered they submitted to martyrdom. And if some of them came and
presented themselves to their persecutors <span
id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494) , they did not do so without
reason; for immediately in that case they were martyred, and thus made
it evident to all that their zeal, and this offering up of themselves to
their enemies, were from the Spirit.
