<span id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p1"></span> §37. *The same subject continued*.

<span id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p2"></span>Things then of conflicting and
opposite nature would not have reconciled themselves, were there not One
higher and Lord over them to unite them, to Whom the elements themselves
yield obedience as slaves that obey a master. And instead of each having
regard to its own nature and fighting with its neighbour, they recognise
the Lord Who has united them, and are at concord one with another, being
by nature opposed, but at amity by the will of Him that guides them. 2.
For if their mingling into one were not due to a higher authority, how
could the heavy mingle and combine with the light, the wet with the dry,
the round with the straight, fire with cold, or sea with earth, or the
sun with the moon, or the stars with the heaven, and the air with the
clouds, the nature of each being dissimilar to that of the other? For
there would be great strife among them, the one burning, the other
giving cold; the heavy dragging downwards, the light in the contrary
direction and upwards; the sun giving light while the air diffused
darkness: yes, even the stars would have been at discord with one
another, since some have their position above, others beneath, and night
would have refused to make way for day, but would have persisted in
remaining to fight and strive against it. 3. But if this were so, we
should consequently see not <span id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span
id="vi.ii.iii.iii-Page_24"></span>an ordered universe, but disorder, not
arrangement but anarchy, not a system, but everything out of system, not
proportion but disproportion. For in the general strife and conflict
either all things would be destroyed, or the prevailing principle alone
would appear. And even the latter would shew the disorder of the whole,
for left alone, and deprived of the help of the others, it would throw
the whole out of gear, just as, if a single hand and foot were left
alone, that would not preserve the body in its integrity. 4. For what
sort of an universe would it be, if only the sun appeared, or only the
moon went her course, or there were only night, or always day? Or what
sort of harmony would it be, again, if the heaven existed alone without
the stars, or the stars without the heaven? Or what benefit would there
be if there were only sea, or if the earth were there alone without
waters and without the other parts of creation? Or how could man, or any
animal, have appeared upon earth, if the elements were mutually at
strife, or if there were one that prevailed, and that one insufficient
for the composition of bodies. For nothing in the world could have been
composed of heat, or cold, or wet, or dry, alone, but all would have
been without arrangement or combination. But not even the one element
which appeared to prevail would have been able to subsist without the
assistance of the rest: for that is how each subsists now.
