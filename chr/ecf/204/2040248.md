<span id="xvi.ii.xxxvii-p1"></span> 83. Such are the words of Antony,
and we ought not to doubt whether such marvels were wrought by the hand
of a man. For it is the promise of the Saviour, when He saith, ‘If ye
have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain,
remove hence and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto
you <span id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134) .’ And again, ‘Verily,
verily, I say unto you, if ye shall ask the father in My name He will
give it you. Ask and ye shall receive <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135) .’ And He himself it is who saith
to His disciples and to all who believe on Him, ‘Heal the sick, cast out
demons; freely ye have received, freely give <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136) .’

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxvii-p5"></span>84. Antony, at any rate, healed not
by commanding, but by prayer and speaking the name of Christ. So that it
was clear to all that it was not he himself who worked, but the Lord who
showed mercy by his means and healed the sufferers. But Antony’s part
was only prayer and discipline, for the sake of which he stayed in the
mountain, rejoicing in the contemplation of divine things, but grieving
when troubled by much people, and dragged to the outer mountain. For all
judges used to ask him to come down, because it was impossible for them
to enter on account of their following of litigants. But nevertheless
they asked him to come that they might but see him. When therefore he
avoided it and refused to go to them, they remained firm, and sent to
him all the more the prisoners under charge of soldiers, that on account
of these he might come down. Being forced by necessity, and seeing them
lamenting, he came into the outer mountain, and again his labour was not
unprofitable. For his coming was advantageous and serviceable to many;
and he was of profit to the judges, counselling them to prefer justice
to all things; to fear God, and to know, ‘that with what judgment they
judged, they should be judged <span id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137)
.’ But he loved more than all things his sojourn in the mountain.
