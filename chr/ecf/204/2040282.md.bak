<span id="xviii.ii.xvii-p1"></span> 17. *Better to pray in a building
than in the desert.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xvii-p2"></span>Now then, I would also meet the other
and only remaining objection of my accuser. He says, the building was
not completed, and prayer ought not to have been made there. But the
Lord said, ‘But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and shut
the door <span id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md) .’ What then will
the accuser answer? or rather what will all prudent and true Christians
say? Let your Majesty ask the opinion of such: for it is written of the
other, ‘The foolish person will speak foolishness <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) ;’ but of these, ‘Ask counsel of
all that are wise <span id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md) .’ When the
Churches were too small, and the people so numerous as they were, and
desirous to go forth into the deserts, what ought I to have done? The
desert has no doors, and all who choose may pass through it, but the
Lord’s house is enclosed with walls and doors, and marks the difference
between the pious and the profane. Will not every wise person then, as
well as your Piety, Sire, give the preference to the latter place? For
they know that here prayer is lawfully offered, while a suspicion of
irregularity attaches to it there. Unless indeed no place proper for it
existed, and the worshippers dwelt only in the desert, as was the case
with Israel; although after the tabernacle was built, they also had
thenceforth a place set apart for prayer. O Christ, Lord and true King
of kings, Only-begotten Son of God, Word and Wisdom of the Father, I am
accused because the people prayed Thy gracious favour, and through Thee
besought Thy Father, who is God over all, to save Thy servant, the most
religious Constantius. But thanks be to Thy goodness, that it is for
this that I am blamed, and for the keeping of Thy laws. Heavier had been
the blame, and more true had been the charge, had we passed by the place
which the Emperor was building, and gone forth into the desert to pray.
How would the accuser then have vented his folly! With what apparent
reason would he have said, ‘He despised the place which you are
building; he does not approve of your undertaking; he passed it by in
derision; he pointed to the desert to supply the want of <span
id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span
id="xviii.ii.xvii-Page_245"></span>room; he prevented the people when
they wished to offer up their prayers.’ This is what he wished to say,
and sought an occasion of saying it; and finding none he is vexed, and
so forthwith invents a charge against me. Had he been able to say this,
he would have confounded me with shame; as now he injures me, copying
the accuser’s ways, and watching for an occasion against those that
pray. Thus has he perverted to a wicked purpose his knowledge of
Daniel’s <span id="fr_1337"></span>[1338](#fn_1337.md) history. But he has
been deceived; for he ignorantly imagined, that Babylonian practices
were in fashion with you, and knew not that you are a friend of the
blessed Daniel, and worship the same God, and do not forbid, but wish
all men to pray, knowing that the prayer of all is, that you may
continue to reign in perpetual peace and safety.
