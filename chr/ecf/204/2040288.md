<span id="xviii.ii.xxiii-p1"></span> 23. *A copy* <span
id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352) *of the letter as follows:*

<span id="xviii.ii.xxiii-p3"></span>Constantius Victor Augustus to
Athanasius <span id="fr_1353"></span>[1354](#fn_1353) . It is not
unknown to your Prudence, how constantly I prayed that success might
attend my late brother Constans in all his undertakings, and your wisdom
will easily judge how greatly I was afflicted, when I learnt that he had
been cut off by the treachery of villains. Now forasmuch as certain
persons are endeavouring at this time to alarm you, by setting before
your eyes that lamentable tragedy, I have thought good to address to
your Reverence this present letter, to exhort you, that, as becomes a
Bishop, you would teach the people to conform to the established <span
id="fr_1354"></span>[1355](#fn_1354) religion, and, according to your
custom, give yourself up to prayer together with them. For this is
agreeable to our wishes; and our desire is, that you should at every
season be a Bishop in your own place.

<span id="xviii.ii.xxiii-p6"></span>And in another hand:—May divine
Providence preserve you, beloved Father, many years.
