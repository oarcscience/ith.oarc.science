<span id="xvi.ii.xxxiii-p1"></span> 72. And Antony also was exceeding
prudent, and the wonder was that although he had not learned letters, he
was a ready-witted and sagacious man. At all events two Greek
philosophers once came, thinking they could try their skill on Antony;
and he was in the outer mountain, and having recognised who they were
from their appearance, he came to them and said to them by means of an
interpreter, ‘Why, philosophers, did ye trouble yourselves so much to
come to a foolish man?’ And when they said that he was not a foolish
man, but exceedingly prudent, he said to them, ‘If you came to a foolish
man, your labour is superfluous; but if you think me prudent become as I
am, for we ought to imitate what is good. And if I had come to you I
should have imitated you; but if you to me, become as I am, for I am a
Christian.’ But they departed with wonder, for they saw that even demons
feared Antony.

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxiii-p2"></span>73. And again others such as these
met him in the outer mountain and thought to mock <span
id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md) him because he had not learned
letters. And Antony said to them, ‘What say ye? which is first, mind or
letters? And which is the cause of which—mind of letters or letters of
mind?’ And when they answered mind is first and the inventor of letters,
Antony said, ‘Whoever, therefore, hath a sound mind hath not need of
letters.’ This answer amazed both the bystanders and the philosophers,
and they departed marvelling that they had seen so much understanding in
an ignorant man. For his manners were not rough as though he had been
reared in the mountain and there grown old, but graceful and polite, and
his speech was seasoned with the divine salt, so that no one was
envious, but rather all rejoiced over him who visited him.

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxiii-p4"></span>74. After this again certain others
came; and these were men who were deemed wise among the Greeks, and they
asked him a reason for our faith in Christ. But when they attempted to
dispute concerning the preaching of the divine Cross and meant to mock,
Antony stopped for a little, and first pitying their ignorance, said,
through an interpreter, who could skilfully interpret his words, ‘Which
is more beautiful, to confess the Cross or to attribute to those whom
you call gods adultery and the seduction of boys? For that which is
chosen by us is a sign of courage and a sure token of the contempt of
death, while yours are the passions of licentiousness. Next, which is
better, to say that the Word of God was not changed, but, being the
same, He took a human body for the salvation and well-being of man, that
having shared in human birth He might make man partake in the divine and
spiritual nature <span id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120.md) ; or to
liken the divine to senseless animals and consequently to worship
four-footed beasts, creeping things and the likenesses of men? For these
things, are the objects of reverence of you wise men. But how do you
dare to mock us, who say that Christ has appeared as man, seeing that
you, bringing the soul from heaven, assert that it has strayed and
fallen from the vault of the sky into body <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121.md) ? And would that you had said that
it had fallen into human body alone, and not asserted that it passes and
changes into four-footed beasts and creeping things. For our faith
declares that the coming of Christ was for the salvation of men. But you
err because you speak of soul as not generated. And we, considering the
power and loving-kindness of Providence, think that the coming of Christ
in the flesh was not impossible with God. But you, although calling the
soul the likeness of Mind <span id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122.md) ,
connect it with falls and <span id="page_216">p. 216</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.xxxiii-Page_216"></span>feign in your myths that it is
changeable, and consequently introduce the idea that Mind itself is
changeable by reason of the soul. For whatever is the nature of a
likeness, such necessarily is the nature of that of which it is a
likeness. But whenever you think such a thought concerning Mind,
remember that you blaspheme even the Father of Mind Himself <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123.md) .

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxiii-p9"></span>75. But concerning the Cross, which
would you say to be the better, to bear it, when a plot is brought about
by wicked men, nor to be in fear of death brought about under any form
whatever <span id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124.md) ; or to prate about
the wanderings of Osiris and Isis, the plots of Typhon, the flight of
Cronos, his eating his children and the slaughter of his father. For
this is your wisdom. But how, if you mock the Cross, do you not marvel
at the resurrection? For the same men who told us of the latter wrote
the former. Or why when you make mention of the Cross are you silent
about the dead who were raised, the blind who received their sight, the
paralytics who were healed, the lepers who were cleansed, the walking
upon the sea, and the rest of the signs and wonders, which shew that
Christ is no longer a man but God? To me you seem to do yourselves much
injustice and not to have carefully read our Scriptures. But read and
see that the deeds of Christ prove Him to be God come upon earth for the
salvation of men.

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxiii-p11"></span>76. But do you tell us *your*
religious beliefs. What can you say of senseless creatures except
senselessness and ferocity? But if, as I hear, you wish to say that
these things are spoken of by you as legends, and you allegorize the
rape of the maiden Persephone of the earth; the lameness of Hephæstus of
fire; and allegorize the air as Hera, the sun as Apollo, the moon as
Artemis, and the sea as Poseidon; none the less, you do not worship God
Himself, but serve the creature rather than God who created all things.
For if because creation is beautiful you composed such legends, still it
was fitting that you should stop short at admiration and not make gods
of the things created; so that you should not give the honour of the
Creator to that which is created. Since, if you do, it is time for you
to divert the honour of the master builder to the house built by him;
and of the general to the soldier. What then can you reply to these
things, that we may know whether the Cross hath anything worthy of
mockery?’

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxiii-p12"></span>77. But when they were at a loss,
turning hither and thither, Antony smiled and said—again through an
interpreter—‘Sight itself carries the conviction of these things. But as
you prefer to lean upon demonstrative arguments, and as you, having this
art, wish us also not to worship God, until after such proof, do you
tell first how things in general and specially the recognition of God
are accurately known. Is it through demonstrative argument or the
working of faith? And which is better, faith which comes through the
inworking (of God) or demonstration by arguments?’ And when they
answered that faith which comes through the inworking was better and was
accurate knowledge, Antony said, ‘You have answered well, for faith
arises from disposition of soul, but dialectic from the skill of its
inventors. Wherefore to those who have the inworking through faith,
demonstrative argument is needless, or even superfluous. For what we
know through faith this you attempt to prove through words, and often
you are not even able to express what we understand. So the inworking
through faith is better and stronger than your professional arguments.’

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxiii-p13"></span>78. ‘We Christians therefore hold
the mystery not in the wisdom of Greek arguments, but in the power of
faith richly supplied to us by God through Jesus Christ. And to show
that this statement is true, behold now, without having learned letters,
we believe in God, knowing through His works His providence over all
things. And to show that our faith is effective, so now we are supported
by faith in Christ, but you by professional logomachies. The portents of
the idols among you are being done away, but our faith is extending
everywhere. You by your arguments and quibbles have converted none from
Christianity to Paganism. We, teaching the faith on Christ, expose your
superstition, since all recognise that Christ is God and the Son of God.
You by your eloquence do not hinder the teaching of Christ. But we by
the mention of Christ crucified put all demons to flight, whom you fear
as if they were gods. Where the sign of the Cross is <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125.md) , magic is weak and witchcraft has
no strength.

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxiii-p15"></span>79. ‘Tell us therefore where your
oracles are now? Where are the charms of the Egyptians? Where the
delusions of the magicians? When did all these things cease and grow
weak except when the Cross of Christ arose? Is It then a fit subject for
mockery, and not rather the things brought to nought by it, and
convicted of weakness? For this is a marvellous thing, that your
religion was never persecuted, but even was honoured by men in every
city, while <span id="page_217">p. 217</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.xxxiii-Page_217"></span>the followers of Christ are
persecuted, and still our side flourishes and multiplies over yours.
What is yours, though praised and honoured, perishes, while the faith
and teaching of Christ, though mocked by you and often persecuted by
kings, has filled the world. For when has the knowledge of God so shone
forth? or when has self-control and the excellence of virginity appeared
as now? or when has death been so despised except when the Cross of
Christ has appeared? And this no one doubts when he sees <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md) the martyr despising death for the
sake of Christ, when he sees for Christ’s sake the virgins of the Church
keeping themselves pure and undefiled.

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxiii-p6"></span> Cf. Plat. *Phædr*. 274 B: but the
resemblances is not close and the relation of this passage to the
Phædrus is probably mediate. I cannot see that the doctrine referred to
here is necessarily different from that of Plotinus (*Enn.* IV. iii.

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxiii-p7"></span> Plotinus (*Enn.* V. i. 3) taught
that the soul was, as it were, an image of Mind, as the uttered word is
of the word in the soul (cf. Philo. *Vit. Mos.* iii. 13).

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxiii-p8"></span> It is certainly startling to find
Antony, ignorant of Greek and of letters, reasoning with philosophers
upon the doctrines of Neoplatonism. His whole life, excepting two short
visits to Alexandria, had been spent out of ear-shot of such
discussions. Yet it is not easy to say exactly how much a man of strong
mind and retentive memory may have picked up from the conversation of
those who visited him upon subjects so widely discussed as these
speculations were.
