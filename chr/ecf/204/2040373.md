class="c10"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p1.2"></span>Texts Explained;
Ninthly,</span> <span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p1.3"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p1.4"></span>[John x.

explanation, that the Son is one with the Father in will and judgment;
but so are all good men, nay things inanimate; contrast of the Son.
Oneness between Them is in nature, because oneness in operation. Angels
not objects of prayer, because they do not work together with God, but
the Son; texts quoted. Seeing an Angel, is not seeing God. Arians in
fact hold two Gods, and tend to Gentile polytheism. Arian explanation
that the Father and Son are one as we are one with Christ, is put aside
by the Regula Fidei, and shewn invalid by the usage of Scripture in
illustrations; the true force of the comparison; force of the terms
used. Force of ‘in us;’ force of ‘as;’ confirmed by S. John. In what
sense we are ‘in God’ and His ‘sons.’*

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p2"></span>10. <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p2.1"></span>However</span> here too they introduce
their private fictions, and contend that the Son and the Father are not
in such wise ‘one,’ or ‘like,’ as the Church preaches, but, as they
themselves would have it <span id="fr_2865"></span>[2866](#fn_2865.md) .
For they say, since what the Father wills, the Son wills also, and is
not contrary either in what He thinks or in what He judges, but is in
all respects concordant <span id="fr_2866"></span>[2867](#fn_2866.md) with
Him, declaring doctrines which are the same, and a word consistent and
united with the Father’s teaching, therefore it is that He and the
Father are One; and some of them have dared to write as well as say
this <span id="fr_2867"></span>[2868](#fn_2867.md) . Now what can be more
unseemly or irrational than this? for if therefore the Son and the
Father are One and if in this way the Word is like the Father, it
follows forthwith <span id="fr_2868"></span>[2869](#fn_2868.md) that the
Angels <span id="fr_2869"></span>[2870](#fn_2869.md) too, and the other
beings above us, Powers and Authorities, and Thrones and Dominions, and
what we see, Sun and Moon, and the Stars, should be sons also, as the
Son; and that it should be said of them too, that they and the Father
are one, and that each is God’s Image and Word. For what God wills, that
will they; and neither in judging nor in doctrine are they discordant,
but in all things are obedient to their Maker. For they would not have
remained in their own glory, unless, what the Father willed, that they
had willed also. He, for instance, who did not remain, but went astray,
heard the words, ‘How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
morning <span id="fr_2870"></span>[2871](#fn_2870.md) ?’ But if this be so,
how is only He Only-begotten Son and Word and Wisdom? or how, whereas so
many are like the Father, is He only an Image? for among men too will be
found many like the Father, numbers, for instance, of martyrs, and
before them the Apostles and Prophets, and again before them the
Patriarchs. And many now too keep the Saviour’s command, being merciful
‘as their Father which is in heaven <span
id="fr_2871"></span>[2872](#fn_2871.md) ,’ and observing the exhortation,
‘Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children, and walk in love, as
Christ also hath loved us <span id="fr_2872"></span>[2873](#fn_2872.md) ;’
many too have become followers of Paul as he also of Christ <span
id="fr_2873"></span>[2874](#fn_2873.md) . And yet no one of these is Word
or Wisdom or Only-begotten Son or Image; nor did any one of them make
bold to say, ‘I and the Father are One,’ or, ‘I in the Father, and the
Father in Me <span id="fr_2874"></span>[2875](#fn_2874.md) ;’ but it is
said of all of them, ‘Who is like unto Thee among the gods, O Lord? and
who shall be likened to the Lord among the sons of Gods <span
id="fr_2875"></span>[2876](#fn_2875.md) ?’ and of Him on the contrary that
He only is Image true and natural of the Father. For though we have been
made after the Image <span id="fr_2876"></span>[2877](#fn_2876.md) , and
called both image and glory of God, yet not on our own account still,
but for that Image and true Glory of God inhabiting us, which is His
Word, who was for us afterwards made flesh, have we this grace of our
designation.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p15"></span>11. This their notion then being
evidently unseemly and irrational as well as the rest, the likeness and
the oneness must be referred to the very Essence of the Son; for unless
it be so taken, He will not be shown to have anything beyond things
originate, as has been said, nor will He be like the Father, but He will
be like the Father’s doctrines; and He differs from the Father, in that
the Father is Father <span id="fr_2877"></span>[2878](#fn_2877.md) , but
the <span id="page_400">p. 400</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-Page_400"></span>doctrines and teaching are the
Father’s. If then in respect to the doctrines and the teaching the Son
is like the Father, then the Father according to them will be Father in
name only, and the Son will not be an exact Image, or rather will be
seen to have no propriety at all or likeness of the Father; for what
likeness or propriety has he who is so utterly different from the
Father? for Paul taught like the Saviour, yet was not like ‘Him in
essence <span id="fr_2878"></span>[2879](#fn_2878.md) .’ Having then such
notions, they speak falsely; whereas the Son and the Father are one in
such wise as has been said, and in such wise is the Son like the Father
Himself and from Him, as we may see and understand son to be towards
father, and as we may see the radiance towards the sun. Such then being
the Son, therefore when the Son works, the Father is the Worker <span
id="fr_2879"></span>[2880](#fn_2879.md) , and the Son coming to the Saints,
the Father is He who cometh in the Son <span
id="fr_2880"></span>[2881](#fn_2880.md) , as He promised when He said, ‘I
and My Father will come, and will make Our abode with him <span
id="fr_2881"></span>[2882](#fn_2881.md) ;’ for in the Image is contemplated
the Father, and in the Radiance is the Light. Therefore also, as we said
just now, when the Father gives grace and peace, the Son also gives it,
as Paul signifies in every Epistle, writing, ‘Grace to you and peace
from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.’ For one and the same
grace is from the Father in the Son, as the light of the sun and of the
radiance is one, and as the sun’s illumination is effected through the
radiance; and so too when he prays for the Thessalonians, in saying,
‘Now God Himself even our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, may He
direct our way unto you <span id="fr_2882"></span>[2883](#fn_2882.md) ,’ he
has guarded the unity of the Father and of the Son. For he has not said,
‘May they direct,’ as if a double grace were given from two Sources,
This and That, but ‘May He direct,’ to shew that the Father gives it
through the Son;—at which these irreligious ones will not blush, though
they well might.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p22"></span>12. For if there were no unity, nor
the Word the own Offspring of the Father’s Essence, as the radiance of
the light, but the Son were divided in nature from the Father, it were
sufficient that the Father alone should give, since none of originate
things is a partner with his Maker in His givings; but, as it is, such a
mode of giving shews the oneness of the Father and the Son. No one, for
instance, would pray to receive from God and the Angels <span
id="fr_2883"></span>[2884](#fn_2883.md) , or from any other creature, nor
would any one say, ‘May God and the Angel give thee;’ but from Father
and the Son, because of Their oneness and the oneness of Their giving.
For through the Son is given what is given; and there is nothing but the
Father operates it through the Son; for thus is grace secure to him who
receives it. And if the Patriarch Jacob, blessing his grandchildren
Ephraim and Manasses, said, ‘God which fed me all my life long unto this
day, the Angel which delivered me from all evil, bless the lads <span
id="fr_2884"></span>[2885](#fn_2884.md) ,’ yet none of created and natural
Angels did he join to God their Creator, nor rejecting God that fed him,
did he from Angel ask the blessing on his grandsons; but in saying, ‘Who
delivered me from all evil,’ he shewed that it was no created Angel, but
the Word of God, whom he joined to the Father in his prayer, through
whom, whomsoever He will, God doth deliver. For knowing that He is also
called the Father’s ‘Angel of great Counsel <span
id="fr_2885"></span>[2886](#fn_2885.md) ,’ he said that none other than He
was the Giver of blessing, and Deliverer from evil. Nor was it that he
desired a blessing for himself from God but for his grandchildren from
the Angel, but whom He Himself had besought saying, ‘I will not let Thee
go except Thou bless me <span id="fr_2886"></span>[2887](#fn_2886.md) ’
(for that was God, as he says himself, ‘I have seen God face to face’),
Him he prayed to bless also the sons of Joseph. It is proper then to an
Angel to minister at the command of God, and often does he go forth to
cast out the Amorite, and is sent to guard the people in the way; but
these are not his doings, but of God who commanded and sent him, whose
also it is to deliver, whom He will deliver. There<span id="page_401">p.
401</span> <span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-Page_401"></span>fore it was no other
than the Lord God Himself whom he had seen, who said to him, ‘And behold
I am with thee, to guard thee in all the way whither thou <span
id="fr_2887"></span>[2888](#fn_2887.md) goest;’ and it was no other than
God whom he had seen, who kept Laban from his treachery, ordering him
not to speak evil words to Jacob; and none other than God did he himself
beseech, saying, ‘Rescue me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I fear
him <span id="fr_2888"></span>[2889](#fn_2888.md) ;’ for in conversation
too with his wives he said, ‘God hath not suffered Laban to injure me.’

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p29"></span>13. Therefore it was none other than
God Himself that David too besought concerning his deliverance, ‘When I
was in trouble, I called upon the Lord, and He heard me; deliver my
soul, O Lord, from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue <span
id="fr_2889"></span>[2890](#fn_2889.md) .’ To Him also giving thanks he
spoke the words of the Song in the seventeenth Psalm, in the day in
which the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from
the hand of Saul, saying, ‘I will love Thee, O Lord my strength; the
Lord is my strong rock and my defence and deliverer <span
id="fr_2890"></span>[2891](#fn_2890.md) .’ And Paul, after enduring many
persecutions, to none other than God gave thanks, saying, ‘Out of them
all the Lord delivered me; and He will deliver in Whom we trust <span
id="fr_2891"></span>[2892](#fn_2891.md) .’ And none other than God blessed
Abraham and Isaac; and Isaac praying for Jacob, said, ‘May God bless
thee and increase thee and multiply thee, and thou shalt be for many
companies of nations, and may He give thee the blessing of Abraham my
father <span id="fr_2892"></span>[2893](#fn_2892.md) .’ But if it belong to
none other than God to bless and to deliver, and none other was the
deliverer of Jacob than the Lord Himself and Him that delivered him the
Patriarch besought for his grandsons, evidently none other did he join
to God in his prayer, than God’s Word, whom therefore he called Angel,
because it is He alone who reveals the Father. Which the Apostle also
did when he said, ‘Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ <span id="fr_2893"></span>[2894](#fn_2893.md) .’ For thus
the blessing was secure, because of the Son’s indivisibility from the
Father, and for that the grace given by Them is one and the same. For
though the Father gives it, through the Son is the gift; and though the
Son be said to vouchsafe it, it is the Father who supplies it through
and in the Son; for ‘I thank my God,’ says the Apostle writing to the
Corinthians, ‘always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given
you in Christ Jesus <span id="fr_2894"></span>[2895](#fn_2894.md) .’ And
this one may see in the instance of light and radiance; for what the
light enlightens, that the radiance irradiates; and what the radiance
irradiates, from the light is its enlightenment. So also when the Son is
beheld, so is the Father, for He is the Father’s radiance; and thus the
Father and the Son are one.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p36"></span>14. But this is not so with things
originate and creatures; for when the Father works, it is not that any
Angel works, or any other creature; for none of these is an efficient
cause <span id="fr_2895"></span>[2896](#fn_2895.md) , but they are of
things which come to be; and moreover being separate and divided from
the only God, and other in nature, and being works, they can neither
work what God works, nor, as I said before, when God gives grace, can
they give grace with Him. Nor, on seeing an Angel would a man say that
he had seen the Father; for Angels, as it is written, are ‘ministering
spirits sent forth to minister <span
id="fr_2896"></span>[2897](#fn_2896.md) ,’ and are heralds of gifts given
by Him through the Word to those who receive them. And the Angel on his
appearance, himself confesses that he has been sent by his Lord; as
Gabriel confessed in the case of Zacharias, and also in the case of
Mary, bearer of God <span id="fr_2897"></span>[2898](#fn_2897.md) . And he
who beholds a vision of Angels, knows that he has seen the Angel and not
God. For Zacharias saw an Angel; and Isaiah saw the Lord. Manoah, the
father of Samson, saw an Angel; but Moses beheld God. Gideon saw an
Angel, but to Abraham appeared God. And neither he who saw God, beheld
an Angel, nor he who saw an Angel, considered that he saw God; for
greatly, or rather wholly, do things by nature originate differ from God
the Creator. But if at any time, when the Angel was seen, he who saw it
heard God’s voice, as took place at the bush; for ‘the Angel of the Lord
was seen in a flame of fire out of the bush, and the Lord called Moses
out of the bush, saying, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham
and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob <span
id="fr_2898"></span>[2899](#fn_2898.md) ,’ yet was not <span
id="page_402">p. 402</span> <span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-Page_402"></span>the
Angel the God of Abraham, but in the Angel God spoke. And what was seen
was an Angel; but God spoke in him <span
id="fr_2899"></span>[2900](#fn_2899.md) . For as He spoke to Moses in the
pillar of a cloud in the tabernacle, so also God appears and speaks in
Angels. So again to the son of Nun He spake by an Angel. But what God
speaks, it is very plain He speaks through the Word, and not through
another. And the Word, as being not separate from the Father, nor unlike
and foreign to the Father’s Essence, what He works, those are the
Father’s works, and His framing of all things is one with His; and what
the Son gives, that is the Father’s gift. And he who hath seen the Son,
knows that, in seeing Him, he has seen, not Angel, nor one merely
greater than Angels, nor in short any creature, but the Father Himself.
And he who hears the Word, knows that he hears the Father; as he who is
irradiated by the radiance, knows that he is enlightened by the sun.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p42"></span>15. For divine Scripture wishing us
thus to understand the matter, has given such illustrations, as we have
said above, from which we are able both to press the traitorous Jews,
and to refute the allegation of Gentiles who maintain and think, on
account of the Trinity, that we profess many gods <span
id="fr_2900"></span>[2901](#fn_2900.md) . For, as the illustration shows,
we do not introduce three Origins or three Fathers, as the followers of
Marcion and Manichæus; since we have not suggested the image of three
suns, but sun and radiance. And one is the light from the sun in the
radiance; and so we know of but one origin; and the All-framing Word we
profess to have no other manner of godhead, than that of the Only God,
because He is born from Him. Rather then will the Ario-maniacs with
reason incur the charge of polytheism or else of atheism <span
id="fr_2901"></span>[2902](#fn_2901.md) , because they idly talk of the Son
as external and a creature, and again the Spirit as from nothing. For
either they will say that the Word is not God; or saying that He is
God <span id="fr_2902"></span>[2903](#fn_2902.md) , because it is so
written, but not proper to the Father’s Essence, they will introduce
many because of their difference of kind (unless forsooth they shall
dare to say that by participation only, He, as all things else, is
called God; though, if this be their sentiment, their irreligion is the
same, since they consider the Word as one among all things). But let
this never even come into our mind. For there is but one form <span
id="fr_2903"></span>[2904](#fn_2903.md) of Godhead, which is also in the
Word; and one God, the Father, existing by Himself according as He is
above all, and appearing in the Son according as He pervades all things,
and in the Spirit according as in Him He acts in all things through the
Word <span id="fr_2904"></span>[2905](#fn_2904.md) . For thus we confess
God to be one through the Triad, and we say that it is much more
religious than the godhead of the heretics with its many kinds <span
id="fr_2905"></span>[2906](#fn_2905.md) , and many parts, to entertain a
belief of the One Godhead in a Triad.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p49"></span>16. For if it be not so, but the
Word is a creature and a work out of nothing, either He is not True God
because He is Himself one of the creatures, or if they name Him God from
regard for the Scriptures, they must of necessity say that there are two
Gods <span id="fr_2906"></span>[2907](#fn_2906.md) , one Creator, the other
creature, and must serve two Lords, one Unoriginate, and the other
originate and a creature; and must have two faiths, one in the True God,
and the other in one who is made and fashioned by themselves and called
God. And it follows of necessity in so great blindness, that, when they
worship the Unoriginate, they renounce the originate, and when they come
to the creature, they turn from the Creator. For they cannot see the One
in the Other, because their natures and operations are foreign and
distinct <span id="fr_2907"></span>[2908](#fn_2907.md) . And with such
sentiments, they will certainly be going on to more gods, for this will
be the essay <span id="fr_2908"></span>[2909](#fn_2908.md) of those who
revolt from the One God. Wherefore then, when the Arians have these
speculations and views, do they not rank themselves with the Gentiles?
for they too, as these, worship the creature rather than God the Creator
of all <span id="fr_2909"></span>[2910](#fn_2909.md) , and though they
shrink from the Gentile name, in order to deceive the unskilful, yet
they secretly hold a like sentiment with them. For their subtle saying
which they are accustomed to urge, We say not two ‘Unoriginates <span
id="fr_2910"></span>[2911](#fn_2910.md) ,’ they plainly say to deceive the
simple; for in their very professing ‘We say not two Unoriginates,’ they
imply two Gods, and these with different natures, one originate and one
Unoriginate. And though the Greeks worship one Unoriginate and many
originate, but these one Unoriginate and one originate, this is no
differ<span id="page_403">p. 403</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-Page_403"></span>ence from them; for the God whom they
call originate is one out of many, and again the many gods of the Greeks
have the same nature with this one, for both he and they are creatures.
Unhappy are they, and the more for that their hurt is from thinking
against Christ; for they have fallen from the truth, and are greater
traitors than the Jews in denying the Christ, and they wallow <span
id="fr_2911"></span>[2912](#fn_2911.md) with the Gentiles, hateful <span
id="fr_2912"></span>[2913](#fn_2912.md) as they are to God, worshipping the
creature and many deities. For there is One God, and not many, and One
is His Word, and not many; for the Word is God, and He alone has the
Form <span id="fr_2913"></span>[2914](#fn_2913.md) of the Father. Being
then such, the Saviour Himself troubled the Jews with these words, ‘The
Father Himself which hath sent Me, hath borne witness of Me; ye have
neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His Form; and ye have not
His Word abiding in you; for whom He hath sent, Him ye believe not <span
id="fr_2914"></span>[2915](#fn_2914.md) .’ Suitably has He joined the
‘Word’ to the ‘Form,’ to shew that the Word of God is Himself Image and
Expression and Form of His Father; and that the Jews who did not receive
Him who spoke to them, thereby did not receive the Word, which is the
Form of God. This too it was that the Patriarch Jacob having seen,
received a blessing from Him and the name of Israel instead of Jacob, as
divine Scripture witnesses, saying, ‘And as he passed by the Form of
God, the Sun rose upon him <span id="fr_2915"></span>[2916](#fn_2915.md) .’
And This it was who said, ‘He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father,’
and, ‘I in the Father and the Father in Me,’ and, ‘I and the Father are
one <span id="fr_2916"></span>[2917](#fn_2916.md) ;’ for thus God is One,
and one the faith in the Father and Son; for, though the Word be God,
the Lord our God is one Lord; for the Son is proper to that One, and
inseparable according to the propriety and peculiarity of His Essence.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p61"></span>17. The Arians, however, not even
thus abashed, reply, ‘Not as you say, but as we will <span
id="fr_2917"></span>[2918](#fn_2917.md) ;’ for, whereas you have overthrown
our former expedients, we have invented a new one, and it is this:—So
are the Son and the Father One, and so is the Father in the Son and the
Son in the Father, as we too may become one in Him. For this is written
in the Gospel according to John, and Christ desired it for us in these
words, ‘Holy Father, keep through Thine own Name, those whom Thou hast
given Me, that they may be one, as We are <span
id="fr_2918"></span>[2919](#fn_2918.md) .’ And shortly after; ‘Neither pray
I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through
their Word; that they all may be one, as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I
in Thee, that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe
that Thou hast sent Me. And the glory which Thou gavest Me I have given
them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and Thou in
Me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know
that Thou didst send Me <span id="fr_2919"></span>[2920](#fn_2919.md) .’
Then, as having found an evasion, these men of craft <span
id="fr_2920"></span>[2921](#fn_2920.md) add, ‘If, as we become one in the
Father, so also He and the Father are one, and thus He too is in the
Father, how pretend you from His saying, “I and the Father are One,” and
“I in the Father and the Father in Me,” that He is proper and like <span
id="fr_2921"></span>[2922](#fn_2921.md) the Father’s Essence? for it
follows either that we too are proper to the Father’s Essence, or He
foreign to it, as we are foreign.’ Thus they idly babble; but in this
their perverseness I see nothing but unreasoning audacity and
recklessness from the devil <span id="fr_2922"></span>[2923](#fn_2922.md) ,
since it is saying after his pattern, ‘We will ascend to heaven, we will
be like the Most High.’ For what is given to man by grace, this they
would make equal to the Godhead of the Giver. Thus hearing that men are
called sons, they thought themselves equal to the True Son by nature
such <span id="fr_2923"></span>[2924](#fn_2923.md) . And now again hearing
from the Saviour, ‘that they may be one as We are <span
id="fr_2924"></span>[2925](#fn_2924.md) ,’ they deceive themselves, and are
arrogant enough to think that they may be such as the Son is in the
Father and the Father in the Son; not considering the fall of their
‘father the devil <span id="fr_2925"></span>[2926](#fn_2925.md) ,’ which
happened upon such an imagination.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p71"></span>18. If then, as we have many times
said, the Word of God is the same with us, and nothing differs from us
except in time, let Him be like us, and have the same place with the
<span id="page_404">p. 404</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-Page_404"></span>Father as we have; nor let Him be
called Only-begotten, nor Only Word or Wisdom of the Father; but let the
same name be of common application to all us who are like Him. For it is
right, that they who have one nature, should have their name in common,
though they differ from each other in point of time. For Adam was a man,
and Paul a man, and he who is now born is a man, and time is not that
which alters the nature of the race <span
id="fr_2926"></span>[2927](#fn_2926.md) . If then the Word also differs
from us only in time, then we must be as He. But in truth neither we are
Word or Wisdom, nor is He creature or work; else why are we all sprung
from one, and He the Only Word? but though it be suitable in them thus
to speak, in us at least it is unsuitable to entertain their
blasphemies. And yet, needless <span
id="fr_2927"></span>[2928](#fn_2927.md) though it be to refine upon <span
id="fr_2928"></span>[2929](#fn_2928.md) these passages, considering their
so clear and religious sense, and our own orthodox belief, yet that
their irreligion may be shewn here also, come let us shortly, as we have
received from the fathers, expose their heterodoxy from the passage. It
is a custom <span id="fr_2929"></span>[2930](#fn_2929.md) with divine
Scripture to take the things of nature as images and illustrations for
mankind; and this it does, that from these physical objects the moral
impulses of man may be explained; and thus their conduct shewn to be
either bad or righteous. For instance, in the case of the bad, as when
it charges, ‘Be ye not like to horse and mule which have no
understanding <span id="fr_2930"></span>[2931](#fn_2930.md) .’ Or as when
it says, complaining of those who have become such, ‘Man, being in
honour, hath no understanding, but is compared unto the beasts that
perish.’ And again, ‘They were as wanton horses <span
id="fr_2931"></span>[2932](#fn_2931.md) .’ And the Saviour to expose Herod
said, ‘Tell that fox <span id="fr_2932"></span>[2933](#fn_2932.md) ;’ but,
on the other hand, charged His disciples, ‘Behold I send you forth as
sheep in the midst of wolves; be ye therefore wise as serpents and
harmless as doves <span id="fr_2933"></span>[2934](#fn_2933.md) .’ And He
said this, not that we may become in nature beasts of burden, or become
serpents and doves; for He hath not so made us Himself, and therefore
nature does not allow of it; but that we might eschew the irrational
motions of the one, and being aware of the wisdom of that other animal,
might not be deceived by it, and might take on us the meekness of the
dove.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p80"></span>19. Again, taking patterns for man
from divine subjects, the Saviour says; ‘Be ye merciful, as your Father
which is in heaven is merciful <span
id="fr_2934"></span>[2935](#fn_2934.md) ;’ and, ‘Be ye perfect, as your
heavenly Father is perfect <span id="fr_2935"></span>[2936](#fn_2935.md) .’
And He said this too, not that we might become such as the Father; for
to become as the Father, is impossible for us creatures, who have been
brought to be out of nothing; but as He charged us, ‘Be ye not like to
horse,’ not lest we should become as draught animals, but that we should
not imitate their want of reason, so, not that we might become as God,
did He say, ‘Be ye merciful as your Father,’ but that looking at His
beneficent acts, what we do well, we might do, not for men’s sake, but
for His sake, so that from Him and not from men we may have the reward.
For as, although there be one Son by nature, True and Only-begotten, we
too become sons, not as He in nature and truth, but according to the
grace of Him that calleth, and though we are men from the earth, are yet
called gods <span id="fr_2936"></span>[2937](#fn_2936.md) , not as the True
God or His Word, but as has pleased God who has given us that grace; so
also, as God do we become merciful, not by being made equal to God, nor
becoming in nature and truth benefactors (for it is not our gift to
benefit but belongs to God), but in order that what has accrued to us
from God Himself by grace, these things we may impart to others, without
making distinctions, but largely towards all extending our kind service.
For only in this way can we anyhow become imitators, and in no other,
when we minister to others what comes from Him. And as we put a fair and
right <span id="fr_2937"></span>[2938](#fn_2937.md) sense upon these texts,
such again is the sense of the lection in John. For he does not say,
that, as the Son is in the Father, such we must become:—whence could it
be? when He is God’s Word and Wisdom, and we were fashioned out of the
earth, and He is by nature and essence Word and true God (for thus
speaks John, ‘We know that the Son of God is come, and He hath given us
an understanding to know Him that is true, and we are in Him that is
true, even in His Son Jesus Christ; this is the true God and eternal
life <span id="fr_2938"></span>[2939](#fn_2938) ’.md) and we are made sons
through Him by adoption and grace, as partaking of His Spirit (for ‘as
many as received Him,’ he says, ‘to them gave He power to become
children of God, even to them that believe on His Name <span
id="fr_2939"></span>[2940](#fn_2939) ’.md), and therefore also He is the
Truth (saying, ‘I am the Truth,’ and in His address to His Father, He
said, ‘Sanctify them through Thy Truth, Thy Word is Truth <span
id="fr_2940"></span>[2941](#fn_2940) ’.md); but we by imitation <span
id="fr_2941"></span>[2942](#fn_2941.md) become virtuous <span
id="fr_2942"></span>[2943](#fn_2942.md) and sons:—therefore <span
id="page_405">p. 405</span> <span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-Page_405"></span>not
that we might become such as He, did He say ‘that they may be one as We
are;’ but that as He, being the Word, is in His own Father, so that we
too, taking an examplar and looking at Him, might become one towards
each other in concord and oneness of spirit, nor be at variance as the
Corinthians, but mind the same thing, as those five thousand in the
Acts <span id="fr_2943"></span>[2944](#fn_2943.md) , who were as one.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p91"></span>20. For it is as ‘sons,’ not as the
Son; as ‘gods,’ not as He Himself; and not as the Father, but ‘merciful
as the Father.’ And, as has been said, by so becoming one, as the Father
and the Son, we shall be such, not as the Father is by nature in the Son
and the Son in the Father, but according to our own nature, and as it is
possible for us thence to be moulded and to learn how we ought to be
one, just as we learned also to be merciful. For like things are
naturally one with like; thus all flesh is ranked together in kind <span
id="fr_2944"></span>[2945](#fn_2944.md) ; but the Word is unlike us and
like the Father. And therefore, while He is in nature and truth one with
His own Father, we, as being of one kind with each other (for from one
were all made, and one is the nature of all men), become one with each
other in good disposition <span id="fr_2945"></span>[2946](#fn_2945.md) ,
having as our copy the Son’s natural unity with the Father. For as He
taught us meekness from Himself, saying, ‘Learn of Me for I am meek and
lowly in heart <span id="fr_2946"></span>[2947](#fn_2946.md) ,’ not that we
may become equal to Him, which is impossible, but that looking towards
Him, we may remain meek continually, so also here wishing that our good
disposition towards each other should be true and firm and indissoluble,
from Himself taking the pattern, He says, ‘that they may be one as We
are,’ whose oneness is indivisible; that is, that they learning from us
of that indivisible Nature, may preserve in like manner agreement one
with another. And this imitation of natural conditions is especially
safe for man, as has been said; for, since they remain and never change,
whereas the conduct of men is very changeable, one may look to what is
unchangeable by nature, and avoid what is bad and remodel himself on
what is best.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p95"></span>21. And for this reason also the
words, ‘that they may be one in Us,’ have a right sense. If, for
instance, it were possible for us to become as the Son in the Father,
the words ought to run, ‘that they may be one in Thee,’ as the Son is in
the Father; but, as it is, He has not said this; but by saying ‘in Us’
He has pointed out the distance and difference; that He indeed is alone
in the Father alone, as Only Word and Wisdom; but we in the Son, and
through Him in the Father. And thus speaking, He meant this only, ‘By
Our unity may they also be so one with each other, as We are one in
nature and truth; for otherwise they could not be one, except by
learning unity in Us.’ And that ‘in Us’ has this signification, we may
learn from Paul, who says, ‘These things I have in a figure transferred
to myself and to Apollos, that ye may learn in us not to be puffed up
above that is written <span id="fr_2947"></span>[2948](#fn_2947.md) .’ The
words ‘in Us’ then, are not ‘in the Father,’ as the Son is in Him; but
imply an example and image, instead of saying, ‘Let them learn of Us.’
For as Paul to the Corinthians, so is the oneness of the Son and the
Father a pattern and lesson to all, by which they may learn, looking to
that natural unity of the Father and the Son, how they themselves ought
to be one in spirit towards each other. Or if it needs to account for
the phrase otherwise, the words ‘in Us’ may mean the same as saying,
that in the power of the Father and the Son they may be one, speaking
the same things <span id="fr_2948"></span>[2949](#fn_2948.md) ; for without
God this is impossible. And this mode of speech also we may find in the
divine writings, as ‘In God will we do great acts;’ and ‘In God I shall
leap over the wall <span id="fr_2949"></span>[2950](#fn_2949.md) ;’ and ‘In
Thee will we tread down our enemies <span
id="fr_2950"></span>[2951](#fn_2950.md) .’ Therefore it is plain, that in
the Name of Father and Son we shall be able, becoming one, to hold firm
the bond of charity. For, dwelling still on the same thought, the Lord
says, ‘And the glory which Thou gavest Me, I have given to them, that
they may be one as We are one.’ Suitably has He here too said, not,
‘that they may be in Thee as I am,’ but ‘as We are;’ now he who says
‘as’ <span id="fr_2951"></span>[2952](#fn_2951.md) , signifies not
identity, but an image and example of the matter in hand.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p101"></span>22. The Word then has the real and
true identity of nature with the Father; but to us it is given to
imitate it, as has been said; for He immediately adds, ‘I in them and
Thou in Me; that they may be made perfect in one.’ Here at length the
Lord asks something greater and more perfect for us; for it is plain
that the Word has come to be in us <span
id="fr_2952"></span>[2953](#fn_2952.md) , for He has put on our body. ‘And
Thou Father in Me;’ ‘for I am Thy Word, and since Thou art in Me,
because I am Thy Word, and I in them because of the body, and because of
Thee the salvation of men is perfected in Me, therefore I ask that they
also may become one, according to the body that is in Me and according
to its perfection; that they too may <span id="page_406">p. 406</span>
<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-Page_406"></span>become perfect, having oneness
with It, and having become one in It; that, as if all were carried by
Me, all may be one body and one spirit, and may grow up unto a perfect
man <span id="fr_2953"></span>[2954](#fn_2953.md) .’ For we all, partaking
of the Same, become one body, having the one Lord in ourselves. The
passage then having this meaning, still more plainly is refuted the
heterodoxy of Christ’s enemies. I repeat it; if He had said simply and
absolutely <span id="fr_2954"></span>[2955](#fn_2954.md) ‘that they may be
one in Thee,’ or ‘that they and I may be one in Thee,’ God’s enemies had
had some plea, though a shameless one; but in fact He has not spoken
simply, but, ‘As Thou, Father, in Me, and I in Thee, that they may be
all one.’ Moreover, using the word ‘as,’ He signifies those who become
distantly as He is in the Father; distantly not in place but in nature;
for in place nothing is far from God <span
id="fr_2955"></span>[2956](#fn_2955.md) , but in nature only all things are
far from Him. And, as I said before, whoso uses the particle ‘as’
implies, not identity, nor equality, but a pattern of the matter in
question, viewed in a certain respect <span
id="fr_2956"></span>[2957](#fn_2956.md) .

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p107"></span>23. Indeed we may learn also from
the Saviour Himself, when He says, ‘For as Jonah was three days and
three nights in the whale’s belly, so shall the Son of man be three days
and three nights in the heart of the earth <span
id="fr_2957"></span>[2958](#fn_2957.md) .’ For Jonah was not as the
Saviour, nor did Jonah go down to hades; nor was the whale hades; nor
did Jonah, when swallowed up, bring up those who had before been
swallowed by the whale, but he alone came forth, when the whale was
bidden. Therefore there is no identity nor equality signified in the
term ‘as,’ but one thing and another; and it shews a certain kind <span
id="fr_2958"></span>[2959](#fn_2958.md) of parallel in the case of Jonah,
on account of the three days. In like manner then we too, when the Lord
says ‘as,’ neither become as the Son in the Father, nor as the Father is
in the Son. For we become one as the Father and the Son in mind and
agreement <span id="fr_2959"></span>[2960](#fn_2959.md) of spirit, and the
Saviour will be as Jonah in the earth; but as the Saviour is not Jonah,
nor, as he was swallowed up, so did the Saviour descend into hades, but
it is but a parallel, in like manner, if we too become one, as the Son
in the Father, we shall not be as the Son, nor equal to Him; for He and
we are but parallel. For on this account is the word ‘as’ applied to us;
since things differing from others in nature, become as they, when
viewed in a certain relation <span id="fr_2960"></span>[2961](#fn_2960.md)
. Wherefore the Son Himself, simply and without any condition is in the
Father; for this attribute He has by nature; but for us, to whom it is
not natural, there is needed an image and example, that He may say of
us, ‘As Thou in Me, and I in Thee.’ ‘And when they shall be so
perfected,’ He says, ‘then the world knows that Thou hast sent Me, for
unless I had come and borne this their body, no one of them had been
perfected, but one and all had remained corruptible. <span
id="fr_2961"></span>[2962](#fn_2961.md) Work Thou then in them, O Father,
and as Thou hast given to Me to bear this, grant to them Thy Spirit,
that they too in It may become one, and may be perfected in Me. For
their perfecting shews that Thy Word has sojourned among them; and the
world seeing them perfect and full of God <span
id="fr_2962"></span>[2963](#fn_2962.md) , will believe altogether that Thou
hast sent Me, and I have sojourned here. For whence is this their
perfecting, but that I, Thy Word, having borne their body, and become
man, have perfected the work, which Thou gavest Me, O Father? And the
work is perfected, because men, redeemed from sin, no longer remain
dead; but being deified <span id="fr_2963"></span>[2964](#fn_2963.md) ,
have in each other, by looking at Me, the bond of charity <span
id="fr_2964"></span>[2965](#fn_2964.md) .’

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p116"></span>24. We then, by way of giving a
rude view of the expressions in this passage, have been led into many
words, but blessed John will shew from his Epistle the sense of the
words, concisely and much more perfectly than we can. And he will both
disprove the interpretation of these irreligious men, and will teach how
we become in God and God in us; and how again we become One in Him, and
how far the Son differs in nature from us, and will stop the Arians from
any longer thinking that they shall be as the Son, lest they hear it
said to them, ‘Thou art a man and not God,’ and ‘Stretch not thyself,
being poor, beside a rich man <span id="fr_2965"></span>[2966](#fn_2965.md)
.’ John then thus writes; ‘Hereby know we that we dwell in Him and He in
us, because He hath given us of His Spirit <span
id="fr_2966"></span>[2967](#fn_2966.md) .’ Therefore because of the grace
of the Spirit which has been given to us, in Him we come to be, and He
in us <span id="fr_2967"></span>[2968](#fn_2967.md) ; and since it is the
Spirit of God, therefore through His becoming in us, reasonably are we,
as having the Spirit, considered to be in God, and thus is God in us.
Not then as the Son in the Father, so <span id="page_407">p. 407</span>
<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-Page_407"></span>also we become in the Father;
for the Son does not merely partake the Spirit, that therefore He too
may be in the Father; nor does He receive the Spirit, but rather He
supplies It Himself to all; and the Spirit does not unite the Word to
the Father <span id="fr_2968"></span>[2969](#fn_2968.md) , but rather the
Spirit receives from the Word. And the Son is in the Father, as His own
Word and Radiance; but we, apart from the Spirit, are strange and
distant from God, and by the participation of the Spirit we are knit
into the Godhead; so that our being in the Father is not ours, but is
the Spirit’s which is in us and abides in us, while by the true
confession we preserve it in us, John again saying, ‘Whosoever shall
confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him and he in
God <span id="fr_2969"></span>[2970](#fn_2969.md) .’ What then is our
likeness and equality to the Son? rather, are not the Arians confuted on
every side? and especially by John, that the Son is in the Father in one
way, and we become in Him in another, and that neither we shall ever be
as He, nor is the Word as we; except they shall dare, as commonly, so
now to say, that the Son also by participation of the Spirit and by
improvement of conduct <span id="fr_2970"></span>[2971](#fn_2970.md) came
to be Himself also in the Father. But here again is an excess of
irreligion, even in admitting the thought. For He, as has been said,
gives to the Spirit, and whatever the Spirit hath, He hath from <span
id="fr_2971"></span>[2972](#fn_2971.md) the Word.

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p124"></span>25. The Saviour, then, saying of
us, ‘As Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they too may be one
in Us,’ does not signify that we were to have identity with Him; for
this was shewn from the instance of Jonah; but it is a request to the
Father, as John has written, that the Spirit should be vouchsafed
through Him to those who believe, through whom we are found to be in
God, and in this respect to be conjoined in Him. For since the Word is
in the Father, and the Spirit is given from <span
id="fr_2972"></span>[2973](#fn_2972.md) the Word, He wills that we should
receive the Spirit, that, when we receive It, thus having the Spirit of
the Word which is in the Father, we too may be found on account of the
Spirit to become One in the Word, and through Him in the Father. And if
He say, ‘as we,’ this again is only a request that such grace of the
Spirit as is given to the disciples may be without failure or
revocation <span id="fr_2973"></span>[2974](#fn_2973.md) . For what the
Word has by nature <span id="fr_2974"></span>[2975](#fn_2974.md) , as I
said, in the Father, that He wishes to be given to us through the Spirit
irrevocably; which the Apostle knowing, said, ‘Who shall separate us
from the love of Christ?’ for ‘the gifts of God’ and ‘grace of His
calling are without repentance <span
id="fr_2975"></span>[2976](#fn_2975.md) .’ It is the Spirit then which is
in God, and not we viewed in our own selves; and as we are sons and
gods <span id="fr_2976"></span>[2977](#fn_2976.md) because of the Word in
us <span id="fr_2977"></span>[2978](#fn_2977.md) , so we shall be in the
Son and in the Father, and we shall be accounted to have become one in
Son and in Father, because that that Spirit is in us, which is in the
Word which is in the Father. When then a man falls from the Spirit for
any wickedness, if he repent upon his fall, the grace remains
irrevocably to such as are willing <span
id="fr_2978"></span>[2979](#fn_2978.md) ; otherwise he who has fallen is no
longer in God (because that Holy Spirit and Paraclete which is in God
has deserted him), but the sinner shall be in him to whom he has
subjected himself, as took place in Saul’s instance; for the Spirit of
God departed from him and an evil spirit was afflicting him <span
id="fr_2979"></span>[2980](#fn_2979.md) . God’s enemies hearing this ought
to be henceforth abashed, and no longer to feign themselves equal to
God. But they neither understand (for ‘the irreligious,’ he saith, ‘does
not understand knowledge’ <span id="fr_2980"></span>[2981](#fn_2980) .md)
nor endure religious words, but find them heavy even to hear.

says that the most ancient (<span class="Greek"><span

of the orthodox faith taught to name and believe the Mother of the Lord
<span class="Greek"><span

Apostolical tradition.’ *Hær.* iv. 12. And John of Antioch, whose
championship of Nestorius and quarrel with S. Cyril are well known,
writes to the former. ‘This title no ecclesiastical teacher has put
aside; those who have used it are many and eminent, and those who have
not used it have not attacked those who used it.’ *Concil. Eph.* part i.
c. 25 (Labb.). Socrates *Hist.* vii. 32. says that Origen, in the first
tome of his Comment on the Romans (vid. de la Rue in Rom. lib. i. 5. the
original is lost), treated largely of the word; which implies that it
was already in use. ‘Interpreting,’ he says, ‘*how* <span
class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p39.7"></span>θεοτόκος</span> is
used, he discussed the question at length.’ Constantine implies the same
in a passage which divines, e.g. Pearson (On the Creed, notes on *Art.*
3.), have not dwelt upon (or rather have apparently overlooked, in
arguing from Ephrem. *ap.* Phot. *Cod.* 228, p. 776. that the literal
phrase ‘Mother of God’ originated in S. Leo). \[See vol. 1, p. 569 of

<span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.1"></span>εἶδος·</span> also in [Gen.

[31](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#031.md)<span
id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.3"></span>. Sept. \[a substitute for Heb.
‘face.’\] vid. Justin *Tryph.* 126. and *supr. de Syn.* 56, n. 6. for
the meaning of the word. It was just now used for ‘kind.’ Athan. says,
*de Syn. ubi supr.* ‘there is but one form of Godhead;’ yet the word is
used of the Son as synonymous with ‘image.’ It would seem as if there
are a certain class of words, all expressive of the One Divine
Substance, which admit of more appropriate application either ordinarily
or under circumstances, to This or That Divine Person who is also that
One Substance. Thus ‘Being’ is more descriptive of the Father as the
<span class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.5"></span>πηγὴ
θεότητος</span>, and He is said to be ‘the Being of the Son;’ yet the
Son is really the One Supreme Being also. On the other hand the words
<span class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.7"></span>μορφὴ</span>
and <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.8"></span>εἶδος</span> \[on them see Lightfoot,
*Philipp.* p. 128\] are rather descriptive of the Divine Substance in
the Person of the Son, and He is called ‘the form of the Father,’ yet
there is but one Form and Face of Divinity, who is at once Each of Three
Persons; while ‘Spirit’ is appropriated to the Third Person, though God
is a Spirit. Thus again S. Hippolytus says <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.10"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.11"></span>κ</span> \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.13"></span>τοῦ πατρὸς</span>\] <span
class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.14"></span>δύναμις
λόγος</span>, yet shortly before, after mentioning the Two Persons, he
adds, <span class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.16"></span>δύναμιν
δὲ μίαν</span>, *contr. Noet.* 7 and 11. And thus the word
‘Subsistence,’ <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.18"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.19"></span>πόστασις</span>, which expresses the
One Divine Substance, has been found more appropriate to express that
Substance viewed personally. Other words may be used correlatively of
either Father or Son; thus the Father is the Life of the Son, the Son
the Life of the Father; or, again, the Father is in the Son and the Son
in the Father. Others in common, as ‘the Father’s Godhead is the Son’s,’
<span class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.21"></span>ἡ</span>
<span class="Greek"><span id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.22"></span>πατρικὴ υἱοῦ
θεότης</span>, as indeed the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv.iii-p57.24"></span>οὐσία</span> itself. Other words on the
contrary express the Substance in This or That Person only, as ‘Word,’
‘Image,’ &c.

[Next: Introductory to Texts from the Gospels on the Incarnation.
Enumeration of texts still to be explained. Arians compared to the Jews.
We must recur to the Regula Fidei. Our Lord did not come into, but
became, man, and therefore had the acts and affections of the flesh. The
same works divine and human. Thus the flesh was purified, and men were
made immortal. Reference to I Pet. iv. 1.](2040374.md)
