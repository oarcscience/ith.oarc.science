<span id="xxi.ii.i.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—<span
class="c10"><span id="xxi.ii.i.iii-p1.2"></span>The Importance of the
Subject</span>. *The Arians affect Scripture language, but their
doctrine new, as well as unscriptural. Statement of the Catholic
doctrine, that the Son is proper to the Father’s substance, and eternal.
Restatement of Arianism in contrast, that He is a creature with a
beginning: the controversy comes to this issue, whether one whom we are
to believe in as God, can be so in name only, and is merely a creature.
What pretence then for being indifferent in the controversy? The Arians
rely on state patronage, and dare not avow their tenets.*

<span id="xxi.ii.i.iii-p2"></span>8. If then the use of certain phrases
of divine Scripture changes, in their opinion, the blasphemy of the
Thalia into reverent language, of course they ought also to deny Christ
with the present Jews, when they see how they study the Law and the
Prophets; perhaps too they will deny the Law <span
id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md) and the Prophets like
Manichees <span id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md) , because the
latter read some portions of the Gospels. If such bewilderment and empty
speaking be from ignorance, Scripture will teach them, that the devil,
the author of heresies, because of the ill savour which attaches to
evil, borrows Scripture language, as a cloak wherewith to sow the ground
with his own poison also, and to seduce the simple. Thus he deceived
Eve; thus he framed former heresies; thus he persuaded Arius at this
time to make a show of speaking against those former ones, that he might
introduce his own without observation. And yet, after all, the man of
craft did not escape. For being irreligious towards the Word of God, he
lost his all at once <span id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854.md) , and
betrayed to all men his ignorance of other heresies too <span
id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md) ; and having not a particle of
truth in his belief, does but pretend to it. For how can he speak truth
concerning the Father, who denies the Son, that reveals concerning Him?
or how can he be orthodox concerning the Spirit, while he speaks
profanely of the Word that supplies the Spirit? and who will trust him
concerning the Resurrection, denying, as he does, Christ for us the
first-begotten from the dead? and how shall he not err in respect to His
incarnate presence, who is simply ignorant of the Son’s genuine and true
generation from the Father? For thus, the former Jews also, denying the
Word, and saying, ‘We have no king but Cæsar <span
id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) ,’ were forthwith stripped of all
they had, and forfeited the light of the Lamp, the odour of ointment,
knowledge of prophecy, and the Truth itself; till now they understand
nothing, but are walking as in darkness. For who was ever yet a hearer
of such a doctrine <span id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) ? or
whence or from whom did the abettors and hirelings <span
id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) of the heresy gain it? who thus
expounded to them when they were at school <span
id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md) ? who told them, ‘Abandon the
worship of the creation, and then draw near and worship a creature and a
work <span id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md) ?’ But if they
themselves own that they have heard it now for the first time, how can
they deny that this heresy is foreign, and not from our fathers <span
id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md) ? But what is not from our fathers,
but has come to light in this day, how can it be but that of which the
blessed Paul <span id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) has foretold,
that ‘in the latter times some shall depart from the sound faith, <span
id="page_311">p. 311</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.i.iii-Page_311"></span>giving heed to seducing spirits and
doctrines of devils, in the hypocrisy of liars; cauterized in their own
conscience, and turning from the truth <span
id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md) ?’

<span id="xxi.ii.i.iii-p15"></span>9. For, behold, we take divine
Scripture, and thence discourse with freedom of the religious Faith, and
set it up as a light upon its candlestick, saying:—Very Son of the
Father, natural and genuine, proper to His essence, Wisdom
Only-begotten, and Very and Only Word of God is He; not a creature or
work, but an offspring proper to the Father’s essence. Wherefore He is
very God, existing one <span id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) in
essence with the very Father; while other beings, to whom He said, ‘I
said ye are Gods <span id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865.md) ,’ had this
grace from the Father, only by participation <span
id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md) of the Word, through the Spirit.
For He is the expression of the Father’s Person, and Light from Light,
and Power, and very Image of the Father’s essence. For this too the Lord
has said, ‘He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father <span
id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867.md) .’ And He ever was and is and never
was not. For the Father being everlasting, His Word and His Wisdom must
be everlasting <span id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868.md) . On the other
hand, what have these persons to shew us from the infamous Thalia? Or,
first of all, let them read it themselves, and copy the tone of the
writer; at least the mockery which they will encounter from others may
instruct them how low they have fallen; and then let them proceed to
explain themselves. For what can they say from it, but that ‘God was not
always a Father, but became so afterwards; the Son was not always, for
He was not before His generation; He is not from the Father, but He, as
others, has come into subsistence out of nothing; He is not proper to
the Father’s essence, for He is a creature and work?’ And ‘Christ is not
very God, but He, as others, was made God by participation; the Son has
not exact knowledge of the Father, nor does the Word see the Father
perfectly; and neither exactly understands nor knows the Father. He is
not the very and only Word of the Father, but is in name only called
Word and Wisdom, and is called by grace Son and Power. He is not
unalterable, as the Father is, but alterable in nature, as the
creatures, and He comes short of apprehending the perfect knowledge of
the Father.’ Wonderful this heresy, not plausible even, but making
speculations against Him that is, that He be not, and everywhere putting
forward blasphemy for reverent language! Were any one, after inquiring
into both sides, to be asked, whether of the two he would follow in
faith, or whether of the two spoke fitly of God,—or rather let them say
themselves, these abettors of irreligion, what, if a man be asked
concerning God (for ‘the Word was God’), it were fit to answer <span
id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869.md) . For from this one question the
whole case on both sides may be determined, what is fitting to say,—He
was, or He was not; always, or before His birth; eternal, or from this
and from then; true, or by adoption, and from participation and in
idea <span id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870.md) ; to call Him one of
things originated, or to unite Him to the Father; to consider Him unlike
the Father in essence, or like and proper to Him; a creature, or Him
through whom the creatures were originated; that He is the Father’s
Word, or that there is another word beside Him, and that by this other
He was originated, and by another wisdom; and that He is only named
Wisdom and Word, and is become a partaker of this wisdom, and second to
it?

<span id="xxi.ii.i.iii-p23"></span>10. Which of the two theologies sets
forth our Lord Jesus Christ as God and Son of the Father, this which you
vomited forth, or that which we have spoken and maintain from the
Scriptures? If the Saviour be not God, nor Word, nor Son, you shall have
leave to say what you will, and so shall the Gentiles, and the present
Jews. But if He be Word of the Father and true Son, and God from God,
and ‘over all blessed for ever <span
id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md) ,’ is it not becoming to obliterate
and blot out those other phrases and that Arian Thalia, as but a pattern
of evil, a store of all irreligion, into which, whoso falls, ‘knoweth
not that giants perish with her, and reacheth the depths of Hades <span
id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md) ?’ This they know themselves, and
in their craft they conceal it, not having the courage to speak out, but
uttering something else <span id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873.md) . For
if they speak, a condemnation will follow; and if they be suspected,
proofs from Scripture will be cast <span
id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md) at them from every side. Wherefore,
in their craft, as children of this world, after feeding their <span
id="page_312">p. 312</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.i.iii-Page_312"></span>so-called lamp from the wild olive,
and fearing lest it should soon be quenched (for it is said, ‘the light
of the wicked shall be put out <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875) ,’.md) they hide it under the
bushel <span id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md) of their hypocrisy,
and make a different profession, and boast of patronage of friends and
authority of Constantius, that what with their hypocrisy and their
professions, those who come to them may be kept from seeing how foul
their heresy is. Is it not detestable even in this, that it dares not
speak out, but is kept hid by its own friends, and fostered as serpents
are? for from what sources have they got together these words? or from
whom have they received what they venture to say <span
id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877.md) ? Not any one man can they specify
who has supplied it. For who is there in all mankind, Greek or
Barbarian, who ventures to rank among creatures One whom he confesses
the while to be God and says, that He was not till He was made? or who
is there, who to the God in whom he has put faith, refuses to give
credit, when He says, ‘This is My beloved Son <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878.md) ,’ on the pretence that He is not a
Son, but a creature? rather, such madness would rouse an universal
indignation. Nor does Scripture afford them any pretext; for it has been
often shewn, and it shall be shewn now, that their doctrine is alien to
the divine oracles. Therefore, since all that remains is to say that
from the devil came their mania (for of such opinions he alone is
sower <span id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879) .md), proceed we to resist
him—for with him is our real conflict, and they are but
instruments;—that, the Lord aiding us, and the enemy, as he is wont,
being overcome with arguments, they may be put to shame, when they see
him without resource who sowed this heresy in them, and may learn,
though late, that, as being Arians, they are not Christians.
