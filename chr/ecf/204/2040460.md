<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Letter LXIII</span>.—*Letter to the
Presbyter Palladius <span id="fr_4798"></span>[4799](#fn_4798.md)* .

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xviii-p3"></span>To our beloved son Palladius,
presbyter, Athanasius the Bishop greeting in the Lord.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xviii-p4"></span>I was glad to receive also the
letter written by you alone, the more so that you breathe orthodoxy in
it, as is your wont. And having learnt not for the first time, but long
ago, the reason of your staying at present with our beloved
Innocent <span id="fr_4799"></span>[4800](#fn_4799.md) , I am pleased with
your piety. Since then you are acting as you are, write and let me know
how are the brethren there, and what the enemies of the truth think
about us. But whereas you have also told me of the monks at Cæsarea, and
I have learned from our beloved Dianius <span
id="fr_4800"></span>[4801](#fn_4800.md) that they are vexed, and are
opposing our beloved bishop Basil, I am glad you have informed me, and I
have pointed out <span id="fr_4801"></span>[4802](#fn_4801.md) to them what
is fitting, namely that as children they should obey their father, and
not oppose what he approves. For if he were suspected as touching the
truth, they would do well to combat him. But if they are confident, as
we all are, that he is a glory to the Church, contending rather on
behalf of the truth and teaching those who require it, it is not right
to combat such an one, but rather to accept with thanks his good
conscience. For from what the beloved Dianius has related, they appear
to be vexed without cause. For he, as I am confident, to the weak
becomes weak to gain the weak <span id="fr_4802"></span>[4803](#fn_4802.md)
. But let our beloved friends look at the scope of his truth, and at his
special purpose <span id="fr_4803"></span>[4804](#fn_4803.md) , and glorify
the Lord Who has given such a bishop to Cappadocia as any district must
pray to have. And do you, beloved, be good enough to point out to them
the duty of obeying, as I write. For this is at once calculated to
render them well disposed toward their father, and will preserve peace
to the churches. I pray that you may be well in the Lord, beloved son.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xviii-p2"></span> On the general subject and date
of this letter see note 1 to *Letter* 62. Of Palladius, who is clearly a
resident at Cæsarea, nothing further is known. The tone of this letter
is more confiding than that of the previous one. (Migne *ib.* 1167.)

<span id="fn_4799"></span>[580:4800](2040460.htm#fr_4799.md) <span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xviii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xviii-p5"></span> Perhaps a bishop in the
neighbourhood of Cæsarea. See D.C.B. s.v. Innocentius (4).

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xviii-p6"></span> Namesake of a predecessor of
Basil, otherwise unknown.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xviii-p7"></span> The letter here referred to is
lost. The monks in question had raised a cry against Basil on account of
the reserve with which he spoke of the Divine Personality of the Holy
Spirit. (See *supr.* p. 481.)
