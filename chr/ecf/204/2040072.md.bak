<span id="vi.ii.i.xxvii-p1"></span> §27. *The refutation of popular
Paganism being taken as conclusive, we come to the higher form of
nature-worship. How Nature witnesses to God by the mutual dependence of
all her parts, which forbid us to think of any one of them as the
supreme God. This shewn at length.*

<span id="vi.ii.i.xxvii-p2"></span>But perhaps those who have advanced
beyond these things, and who stand in awe of Creation, being put to
shame by these exposures of abominations, will join in repudiating what
is readily condemned and refuted on all hands, but will think that they
have a well-grounded and unanswerable opinion, namely, the worship of
the universe and of the parts of the universe. 2. For they will boast
that they worship and serve, not mere stocks and stones and forms of men
and irrational birds and creeping things and beasts, but the sun and
moon and all the heavenly universe, and the earth again, and the entire
realm of water: and they will say that none can shew that these at any
rate are not of divine nature, since it is evident to all, that they
lack neither life nor reason, but transcend even the nature of mankind,
inasmuch as the one inhabit the heavens, the other the earth. 3. It is
worth while then to look into and examine these points also; for here,
too, our argument will find that its proof against them holds true. But
before we look, or begin our demonstration, it suffices that Creation
almost raises its voice against them, and points to God as its Maker and
Artificer, Who reigns over Creation and over all things, even the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ; Whom the would-be philosophers turn from to
worship and deify the Creation which proceeded from Him, which yet
itself worships and confesses the Lord Whom they deny on its account. 4.
For if men are thus awestruck at the parts of Creation and think that
they are gods, they might well be rebuked by the mutual dependence of
those parts; which moreover makes known, and witnesses to, the Father of
the Word, Who is the Lord and Maker of these parts also, by the unbroken
law of their obedience to Him, as the divine law also says: “The heavens
declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth His handiwork <span
id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) .” 5. But the proof of all this is not
obscure, but is clear enough in all conscience to those the eyes of
whose understanding are not wholly disabled. For if a man take the parts
of Creation separately, and consider each by itself,—as for example the
sun by itself alone, and the moon apart, and again earth and air, and
heat and cold, and the essence of wet and of dry, separating them from
their mutual conjunction,—he will certainly find that not one is
sufficient for itself but all are in need of one another’s assistance,
and subsist by their mutual help. For the Sun is carried round along
with, and is contained in, the whole heaven, and can never go beyond his
own orbit, while the moon and other stars testify to the assistance
given them by the Sun: while the earth again evidently does not yield
her crops without rains, which in their turn would not descend to earth
without the assistance of the clouds; but not even would the clouds ever
appear of themselves and subsist, without the air. And the air is warmed
by the upper air, but illuminated and made bright by the sun, not by
itself. 6. And wells, again, and rivers will never exist without the
earth; but the earth is not supported upon itself, but is set upon the
realm of the waters, while this again is kept in its place, being bound
fast at the centre of the universe. And the sea, and the great ocean
that flows outside round the whole earth, is moved and borne by winds
wherever the force of the winds dashes it. And the winds in their turn
originate, not in themselves, but according to those who have written on
the subject, in the air, from the burning heat and high temperature of
the upper as compared with the lower air, and blow everywhere through
the latter. 7. For as to the four elements of which the nature of bodies
is composed, heat, that is, and cold, wet and dry, who is so perverted
in his understanding as not to know that these things exist indeed in
combination, but if separated and taken alone they tend to destroy even
one another according to the prevailing power of the more abundant
element? For heat is destroyed by cold if it be present in greater
quantity, and cold again is put away by the power of heat, and what is
dry, again, is moistened by wet, and the latter dried by the former.
