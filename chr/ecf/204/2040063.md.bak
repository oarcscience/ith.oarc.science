<span id="vi.ii.i.xviii"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i.xviii-p1"></span> §18. *Heathen defence continued. (2)
‘The gods are worshipped for having invented the Arts of Life.’ But this
is a human and natural, not a divine, achievement. And why, on this
principle, are not all inventors deified?*

<span id="vi.ii.i.xviii-p2"></span>What defence, then, what proof that
these are real gods, can they offer who hold this superstition? For, by
what has been said just above, our argument has demonstrated them to be
men, and not respectable men. But perhaps they will turn to another
argument, and proudly appeal to the things useful to life discovered by
them, saying that the reason why they regard them as gods is their
having been of use to mankind. For Zeus is said to have possessed the
plastic art, Poseidon that of the pilot, Hephæstus the smith’s, Athena
that of weaving, Apollo that of music, Artemis that of hunting, Hera
dressmaking, Demeter agriculture, and others other arts, as those who
inform us about them have related. 2. But men ought to ascribe them and
such like arts not to the gods alone but to the common nature of
mankind, for by observing nature <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md)
men discover the arts. For even common parlance calls art an imitation
of nature. If then they have been skilled in the arts they pursued, that
is no reason for thinking them gods, but rather for thinking them men;
for the arts were not their creation, but in them they, like others,
imitated nature. 3. For men having a natural capacity for knowledge
according to the definition laid down <span
id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) concerning them, there is nothing to
surprise us if by human intelligence, and by looking of themselves at
their own nature and coming to know it, they have hit upon the arts. Or
if they say <span id="page_14">p. 14</span> <span
id="vi.ii.i.xviii-Page_14"></span>that the discovery of the arts
entitles them to be proclaimed as gods, it is high time to proclaim as
gods the discoverers of the other arts on the same grounds as the former
were thought worthy of such a title. For the Phœnicians invented
letters, Homer epic poetry, Zeno of Elea dialectic, Corax of Syracuse
rhetoric, Aristæus bee-keeping, Triptolemus the sowing of corn, Lycurgus
of Sparta and Solon of Athens laws; while Palamedes discovered the
arrangement of letters, and numbers, and measures and weights. And
others imparted various other things useful for the life of mankind,
according to the testimony of our historians. 4. If then the arts make
gods, and because of them carved gods exist, it follows, on their
shewing, that those who at a later date discovered the other arts must
be gods. Or if they do not deem these worthy of divine honour, but
recognise that they are men, it were but consistent not to give even the
name of gods to Zeus, Hera, and the others, but to believe that they too
have been human beings, and all the more so, inasmuch as they were not
even respectable in their day; just as by the very fact of sculpturing
their form in statues they shew that they are nothing else but men.
