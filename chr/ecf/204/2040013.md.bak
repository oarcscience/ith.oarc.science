id="v.ii.i-p28.2"></span>Montfaucon</span>.

<span id="v.ii.i-p29"></span>Athanasius was born between 296 and
298 <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) . His parents, according to later
writers, were of high rank and wealthy. At any rate, their son received
a liberal education. In his most youthful work we find him repeatedly
quoting Plato, and ready with a definition from the Organon of
Aristotle. He is also familiar with the theories of various
philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of
Neo-Platonism. In later works, he quotes Homer more than once (*Hist.
Ar.* 68, *Orat.* iv. 29), he addresses to Constantius a defence bearing
unmistakeable traces of a study of Demosthenes *de Corona* (Fialon, pp.
286 *sq*. 293). His education was that of a Greek: Egyptian antiquities
and religion, the monuments and their history, have no special interest
for him: he nowhere betrays any trace of Egyptian national feeling. But
from early years another element had taken a first place in his training
and in his interest. It was in the Holy Scriptures that his martyr
teachers had instructed him, and in the Scriptures his mind and writings
are saturated. Ignorant of Hebrew, and only rarely appealing to other
Greek versions (to Aquila once in the Ecthesis, to other versions once
or twice upon the Psalms), his knowledge of the Old Testament is limited
to the Septuagint. But of it, as well as of the New Testament, he has an
astonishing command, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.i-p30.2"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.i-p30.3"></span>Α</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.i-p30.4"></span>λεξανδρεὺς τῷ γένει, ἀνὴρ λόγιος, δυνατὸς ὢν ἐν
ταῖς γραφαῖς</span>. The combination of Scriptural study and of Greek
learning was what one expects in a pupil of the famous Alexandrian
School; and it was in this School, the School of Clement and Origen, of
Dionysius and Theognostus, that young Athanasius learned, possibly at
first from the lips of Peter the bishop and martyr of 311 <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) . The influence of Origen still coloured the
traditions of the theological school of Alexandria. It was from
Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria 312–328, himself an Origenist ‘of the
right wing,’ that Athanasius received his moulding at the critical
period of his later teens.

<span id="v.ii.i-p32"></span>Of his first introduction to Alexander a
famous story is told by Rufinus (*Hist. Eccl.* I. xiv.). The Bishop, on
the anniversary of the martyrdom of his predecessor, Peter, was
expecting some clergy to dinner after service in a house by the sea. Out
of the window, he saw some boys at play on the shore: as he watched, he
saw that they were imitating the sacred rites of the Church. Thinking at
last that they were going too far, he sent some of his clergy to bring
them in. At first his enquiries of the little fellows produced an
alarmed denial. But at length he elicited that one of them had acted the
Bishop and had baptized some of the others in the character of
catechumens. On ascertaining that all details had been duly observed, he
consulted his clergy, and decided that the baptisms should be treated as
valid, and that the boy-bishop and his clergy had given such plain proof
of their vocation that their parents must be instructed to hand them
over to be educated for the sacred profession. Young Athanasius
accordingly, after a further course of elementary studies, was handed
over to the bishop to be brought up, like Samuel, in the Temple of God.
This, adds Sozomen (ii. 17), was the origin of his subsequent attachment
to Alexander as deacon and secretary. The story is credited by some
writers of weight (most recently, by Archdeacon Farrar), but seems
highly improbable. It depends on the single authority of a writer not
famed for historical judgment, and on the very first anniversary of
Peter’s martyrdom, when Alexander had hardly ascended the episcopal
throne, Athanasius was at least fourteen years old. The probability that
the anniversary would have been other than the first, and the
possibility that Athanasius was even older, coupled with the certainty
that his theological study began before Peter’s martyrdom, compel us to
mark the story with at least a strong note of interrogation. But it may
be allowed to confirm us in the belief that Alexander early singled out
the promise of ability and devotion which marked Athanasius for his
right-hand man long before the crisis which first proved his unique
value.

<span id="v.ii.i-p33"></span>His years of study and work in the bishop’s
household bore rich fruit in the two youthful works already alluded to.
These works more than any later writings of Athanasius bear traces of
the Alexandrian theology and of the influence of Origenism: but in them
already we trace the independent grasp of Christian principles which
mark Athanasius as the representative of something more than a school,
however noble and many-sided. It was not as a theologian, but as a
believing soul in need of a Saviour, that Athanasius approached the
mystery of Christ. Throughout the mazes of the Arian controversy his
tenacious hold upon this fundamental principle steered his course and
balanced his theology. And it is this that above all else characterises
the golden treatise on the Incarnation of the Word. There is, however,
one <span id="page_xv">p. xv</span> <span
id="v.ii.i-Page_xv"></span>element in the influence of Origen and his
successors which already comes out, and which never lost its hold upon
Athanasius,—the principle of asceticism. Although the ascetic tendency
was present in Christianity from the first, and had already burst forth
into extravagance in such men as Tertullian, it was reserved for the
school of Origen, influenced by Platonist ideas of the world and life,
to give to it the rank of an acknowledged principle of Christian
morals—to give the stimulus to monasticism (see below, p. 193). Among
the acclamations which accompanied the election of Athanasius to the
episcopate that of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.i-p33.1"></span>εἷς τῶν ἀσκηῶν</span> was conspicuous (*Apol.
Ar*. 6). In *de Incarn*. 51. 1, 48. 2, we seem to recognise the future
biographer of Antony <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) .

<span id="v.ii.i-p30"></span> He was unable to speak from memory of the
events of the persecution of 303 (*Hist. Ar.* 64), but (*de Incarn.* 56.
2) had been instructed in religion by persons who had suffered as
martyrs. This must have been before 311, the date of the last
persecution in Egypt under Maximin. Before 319 he had written his first
books ‘against the Gentiles,’ the latter of which, on the Incarnation,
implies a full maturity of power in the writer, while the former is full
of philosophical and mythological knowledge such as argues advanced
education. But from several sources we learn that his election to the
episcopate in 328 was impugned, at any rate in after years, on the
ground of his not having attained the canonical age of thirty. There is
no ground for supposing that this was true: but such a charge would not
be made without some ground at least of plausibility. We must therefore
suppose that on June 8, 328, he was not much beyond his thirtieth year.
His parents, moreover, were living after the year 358 (see below, p.
562, note 6); allowing them over fourscore years at that date, we find
in 298 a reasonable date for the birth of their son. We must remember
that in southern climates mind and body mature somewhat more rapidly
than with ourselves, and ‘contra Gentes’ and ‘de Incarnatione’ will
scarcely appear precocious.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[xiv:2](2040013.htm#fr_1.md) <span
id="v.ii.i-p30.5"></span>

<span id="v.ii.i-p31"></span> The statements of Greg. Naz. that he
frequented classes of grammar and rhetoric is probable enough; that of
Sulpitius Severus that he was ‘juris consultus’ lacks corroboration.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[xv:3](2040013.htm#fr_2.md) <span
id="v.ii.i-p33.2"></span>

<span id="v.ii.i-p34"></span> The actual connection of Athanasius with
Antony at this period is implied in the received text of ‘Vit. Anton.’
*Prolog.,* for it could scarcely fall at any later date. At the same
time the youthful life of Athanasius seems fully accounted for in such a
way as to leave little room for it (so Tillemont). But our ignorance of
details leaves it just possible that he may for a time have visited the
great hermit and ministered to him as Elisha did of old to Elijah. (Cf.
p. 195, note 2.)
