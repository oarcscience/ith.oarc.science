id="xviii.ii.i-p1.1"></span>Defence Before Constantius.</span>

<span id="xviii.ii.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xviii.ii.i-p3"></span>1. Knowing that you have been a
Christian for many years <span id="fr_1281"></span>[1282](#fn_1281.md) ,
most religious Augustus, and that you are godly by descent, I cheerfully
undertake to answer for myself at this time;—for I will use the language
of the blessed Paul, and make him my advocate before you, considering
that he was a preacher of the truth, and that you are an attentive
hearer of his words.

<span id="xviii.ii.i-p5"></span>With respect to those ecclesiastical
matters, which have been made the ground of a conspiracy against me, it
is sufficient to refer your Piety to the testimony of the many Bishops
who have written in my behalf <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282.md)
; enough too is the recantation of Ursacius and Valens <span
id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283.md) to prove to all men, that none of
the charges which they set up against me had any truth in them. For what
evidence can others produce so strong, as what they declared in writing?
‘We lied, we invented these things; all the accusations against
Athanasius are full of falsehood.’ To this clear proof may be added, if
you will vouchsafe to hear it, this circumstance that the accusers
brought no evidence against Macarius the presbyter while we were
present; but in our absence <span id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284.md) ,
when they were by themselves, they managed the matter as they pleased.
Now, the Divine Law first of all, and next our own Laws <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md) , have expressly declared, that
such proceedings are of no force whatsoever. From these things your
piety, as a lover of God and of the truth, will, I am sure, perceive
that we are free from all suspicion, and will pronounce our opponents to
be false accusers.

Constantius, though here called a Christian, was not baptized till his
last illness, <span class="c10"><span
id="xviii.ii.i-p4.3"></span>a.d.</span> 361, and then by the Arian
Bishop of Antioch, Euzoius. At this time he was 39 years of age.
Theodoret represents him making a speech to his whole army on one
occasion, exhorting them to Baptism previous to going to war; and
recommending all to go thence who could not make up their mind to the
Sacrament. *H. E.* iii. 1. Constantius, his grandfather, had rejected
idolatry and acknowledged the One God, according to Eusebius, *V.
Const.* i. 14, though it does not appear that he had embraced
Christianity.
