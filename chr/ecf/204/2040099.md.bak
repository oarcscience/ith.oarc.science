<span id="vii.ii.ii"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p1"></span> §2. *Erroneous views of Creation
rejected. (1) Epicurean (fortuitous generation). But diversity of bodies
and parts argues a creating intellect. (2.) Platonists (pre-existent
matter.) But this subjects God to human limitations, making Him not a
creator but a mechanic. (3) Gnostics (an alien Demiurge). Rejected from
Scripture*.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p2"></span>Of the making of the universe and the
creation of all things many have taken different views, and each man has
laid down the law just as he pleased. For some say that all things have
come into being of themselves, and in a chance fashion; as, for example,
the Epicureans, who tell us in their self-contempt, that universal
providence does not exist, speaking right in the face of obvious fact
and experience. 2. For if, as they say, everything <span id="page_37">p.
37</span> <span id="vii.ii.ii-Page_37"></span>has had its beginning of
itself, and independently of purpose, it would follow that everything
had come into <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) mere being, so as
to be alike and not distinct. For it would follow in virtue of the unity
of body that everything must be sun or moon, and in the case of men it
would follow that the whole must be hand, or eye, or foot. But as it is
this is not so. On the contrary, we see a distinction of sun, moon, and
earth; and again, in the case of human bodies, of foot, hand, and head.
Now, such separate arrangement as this tells us not of their having come
into being of themselves, but shews that a cause preceded them; from
which cause it is possible to apprehend God also as the Maker and
Orderer of all.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p4"></span>3. But others, including Plato, who is in
such repute among the Greeks, argue that God has made the world out of
matter previously existing and without beginning. For God could have
made nothing had not the material existed already; just as the wood must
exist ready at hand for the carpenter, to enable him to work at all. 4.
But in so saying they know not that they are investing God with
weakness. For if He is not Himself the cause of the material, but makes
things only of previously existing material, He proves to be weak,
because unable to produce anything He makes without the material; just
as it is without doubt a weakness of the carpenter not to be able to
make anything required without his timber. For, *ex hypothesi,* had not
the material existed, God would not have made anything. And how could He
in that case be called Maker and Artificer, if He owes His ability to
make to some other source—namely, to the material? So that if this be
so, God will be on their theory a Mechanic only, and not a Creator out
of nothing <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) ; if, that is, He
works at existing material, but is not Himself the cause of the
material. For He could not in any sense be called Creator unless He is
Creator of the material of which the things created have in their turn
been made. 5. But the sectaries imagine to themselves a different
artificer of all things, other than the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
in deep blindness even as to the words they use. 6. For whereas the Lord
says to the Jews <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) : “Have ye not
read that from the beginning He which created them made them male and
female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and
mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall become one
flesh?” and then, referring to the Creator, says, “What, therefore,
<span class="c10"><span id="vii.ii.ii-p6.3"></span>God</span> hath
joined together let not man put asunder:” how come these men to assert
that the creation is independent of the Father? Or if, in the words of
John, who says, making no exception, “All things <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) were made by Him,” and “without Him
was not anything made,” how could the artificer be another, distinct
from the Father of Christ?

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p3"></span> Or, “been made in one way only.” In the

class="Greek"><span id="vii.ii.ii-p3.4"></span>ἐπὶ σώματος ἕνος</span>
‘as in the case of the universe;’ but although the rendering has
commended itself to others I now reluctantly admit that it puts too much
into the Greek (in spite of §41. 5).

[Next: The true doctrine. Creation out of nothing, of God's lavish
bounty of being. Man created above the rest, but incapable of
independent perseverance. Hence the exceptional and supra-natural gift
of being in God's Image, with the promise of bliss conditionally upon
his perseverance in grace.](2040100.md)
