<span id="xvi.ii.xv-p1"></span> 47. And when at last the persecution
ceased, and the blessed Bishop Peter <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md) had borne his testimony, Antony
departed, and again withdrew to his cell, and was there daily a martyr
to his conscience, and contending in the conflicts of faith. And his
discipline was much severer, for he was ever fasting, and he had a
garment of hair on the inside, while the outside was skin, which he kept
until his end. And he neither bathed his body with water to free himself
from filth, nor did he ever wash his feet, nor even endure so much as to
put them into water, unless compelled by necessity. Nor did any one even
see him unclothed, nor his body naked at all, except after his death,
when he was buried.
