<span id="xviii.ii.vi-p1"></span> 6. *The second charge, of
corresponding with Magnentius.*

<span id="xviii.ii.vi-p2"></span>With regard to the second calumny, that
I have written letters to the tyrant <span
id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306.md) (his name I am unwilling to
pronounce), I beseech you investigate and try the matter, in whatever
way you please, and by whomsoever you may approve of. The extravagance
of the charge so confounds me, that I am in utter uncertainty how to
act. Believe me, most religious Prince, many times did I weigh the
matter in my mind, but was unable to believe that any one could be so
mad as to utter such a falsehood. But when this charge was published
abroad by the Arians, as well as the former, and they boasted that they
had delivered to you a copy of the letter, I was the more amazed, and I
used to pass sleepless nights contending against the charge, as if in
the presence of my accusers; and suddenly breaking forth into a loud
cry, I would immediately fall to my prayers, desiring with groans and
tears that I might obtain a favourable hearing from you. And now that by
the grace of the Lord, I have obtained such a hearing, I am again at a
loss how I shall begin my defence; for as often as I make an attempt to
speak, I am prevented by my horror at the deed. In the case of your
departed brother, the slanderers had indeed a plausible pretence for
what they alleged; because I had been admitted to see him, and he had
condescended to write to your brotherly affection concerning me; and he
had often sent for me to come to him, and had honoured me when I came.
But for the traitor Magnentius, ‘the Lord is witness, and His Anointed
is witness <span id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307.md) ,’ I know him not,
nor was ever acquainted with him. What correspondence then could there
be between persons so entirely unacquainted with each other? What reason
was there to induce me to write to such a man? How could I have
commenced my letter, had I written to him? Could I have said, ‘You have
done well to murder the man who honoured me, whose kindness I shall
never forget?’ Or, ‘I approve of your conduct in destroying our
Christian friends, and most faithful brethren?’ or, ‘I approve of your
proceedings in butchering those who so kindly entertained me at Rome;
for instance, your departed Aunt Eutropia <span
id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308.md) , whose disposition answered to her
name, that worthy man, Abuterius, the most faithful Spirantius, and many
other excellent persons?’

<span id="xviii.ii.vi-p5"></span> Nepotian, the son of Eutropia,
Constantine’s sister, had taken up arms against Magnentius, got
possession of Rome, and enjoyed the title of Augustus for about a month.
Magnentius put him to death, and his mother, and a number of his
adherents, some of whom are here mentioned.
