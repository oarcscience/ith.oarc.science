<span id="v.ii.ii-p1"></span> §2. *The Arian Controversy before Nicæa,*
319–325.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p2"></span>At the time when Athanasius first appeared
as an author, the condition of Christian Egypt was not peaceful.
Meletius, bishop of Lycopolis, was accused of having sacrificed during
the persecution in 301 (pp. 131, 234); condemned by a synod under bishop
Peter, he had carried on schismatical intrigues under Peter, Achillas,
and Alexander, and by this time had a large following, especially in
Upper Egypt. Many cities had Meletian bishops: many of the hermits, and
even communities of monks (p. 135), were on his side.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p3"></span>The Meletian account of the matter
(preserved by Epiphan. *Hær*. 58) was different from this. Meletius had
been in prison along with Peter, and had differed from him on the
question of the lapsed, taking the sterner view, in which most of the
imprisoned clergy supported him. It would not be without a parallel
(<span class="c10"><span id="v.ii.ii-p3.1"></span>D.C.B</span>. art.
<span class="c10"><span id="v.ii.ii-p3.2"></span>Donatists,
Novatian</span>) in the history of the burning question of the *lapsi*
to suppose that Meletius recoiled from a compromised position to the
advocacy of impossible strictness. At any rate (*de Incarn*. 24. 4) the
Egyptian Church was rent by a formidable schism. No doctrinal question,
however, was involved. The alliance of Meletians and Arians belongs to a
later date.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p4"></span>It is doubtful whether the outbreak of the
Arian controversy at Alexandria was directly connected with the previous
Christological controversies in the same Church. The great Dionysius
some half-century before had been involved in controversy with members
of his Church both in Alexandria and in the suffragan dioceses of Libya
(*infr*. p. 173). Of the sequel of that controversy we have no direct
knowledge: but we find several bishops and numerous clergy and laity in
Alexandria and Libya <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) ready to side
with Arius against his bishop.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p6"></span>The origin of the controversy is obscure.
It certainly must be placed as early as 318 or 319, to leave sufficient
time before the final deposition of Arius in the council of 321 (*infr*.
p. 234). We are told that Arius, a native of Libya, had settled in
Alexandria soon after the origin of the Meletian schism, and had from
motives of ambition sided at first with Meletius, then with Peter, who
ordained him deacon, but afterwards was compelled to depose him (Epiph.
*Hær*. 69, Sozom. i. 15). He became reconciled to Achillas, who raised
him to the presbyterate. Disappointed of the bishopric at the election
of Alexander, he nurtured a private grudge (Thdt. *H. E*. i. 2), which
eventually culminated in opposition to his teaching. These tales deserve
little credit: they are unsupported by Athanasius, and bear every trace
of invention *ex post facto*. That Arius was a vain person we see from
his Thalia (*infr*. p. 308): but he certainly possessed claims to
personal respect, and we find him not only in charge of the urban parish
of Baucalis, but entrusted with the duties of a professor of scriptural
exegesis. There is in fact no necessity to seek for personal motives to
explain the dispute. The Arian problem was one which the Church was
unable to avoid. Not until every alternative had been tried and rejected
was the final theological expression of her faith possible. Two great
streams of theological influence had run their course in the third
century: the subordinationist theology of Origen at Alexandria, the
Monarchian theology of the West and of Asia which had found a logical
expression in Paul of Samosata. Both streams had met in Lucian the
martyr, at Antioch, and in Arius, the pupil of Lucian, produced a result
which combined elements of both (see below, §3 (2) a). According to some
authorities Arius was the aggressor. He challenged some theological
statements of Alexander as Sabellian, urging in opposition to them that
if the Son were truly a Son He must have had a beginning, and that there
had been therefore a time <span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span> <span
id="v.ii.ii-Page_xvi"></span>when He did not exist. According to others
(Constantine in Eus. *Vit*. ii. 69) Alexander had demanded of his
presbyters an explanation of some passage of Scripture which had led
Arius to broach his heresy. At any rate the attitude of Alexander was at
first conciliatory. Himself an Origenist, he was willing to give Arius a
fair hearing (Sozom. *ubi supra*). But the latter was impracticable. He
began to canvass for support, and his doctrine was widely accepted.
Among his first partisans were a number of lay people and virgins, five
presbyters of Alexandria, six deacons, including Euzoius, afterwards
Arian bishop at Antioch (<span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.ii-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 361), and the Libyan bishops
Secundus of Ptolemais in Pentapolis (see p. 226) and Theonas of
Marmarica (see p. 70). A letter was addressed to Arius and his friends
by Alexander, and signed by the clergy of Alexandria, but without
result. A synod was now called (*infr*. p. 70, *Socr*. i. 6) of the
bishops of Egypt and Libya, and Arius and his allies deposed. Even this
did not check the movement. In Egypt two presbyters and four deacons of
the Mareotis, one of the former being Pistus, a later Arian bishop of
Alexandria, declared for Arius; while abroad he was in correspondence
with influential bishops who cordially promised their support.
Conspicuous among the latter was a man of whom we shall hear much in the
earlier treatises of this volume, Eusebius, bishop of Berytus, who had
recently, against the older custom of the Church (p. 103, note 6), but
in accordance with what has ever since been general in the case of
important sees, been translated to the imperial city of Nicomedia. High
in the favour, perhaps related to the family, of Constantine, possessed
of theological training and practical ability, this remarkable man was
for nearly a quarter of a century the head and centre of the Arian
cause. (For his character and history, see the excellent article in
D.C.B. ii. 360–367.) He had been a fellow-pupil of Arius in the school
of Lucian, and fully shared his opinions (his letter to Paulinus of
Tyre, Thdt. *H. E*. i. 6). The letter addressed to him by Arius (ib. 5)
is one of our most important Arian monuments. Arius claims the sympathy
of Eusebius of Cæsarea and other leading bishops, in fact of all the
East excepting Macarius of Jerusalem and two others, ‘heretical and
untutored persons.’ Eusebius responded with zeal to the appeal of his
‘fellow-Lucianist.’ While Alexander was indefatigable in writing to warn
the bishops everywhere against Arius (who had now left Alexandria to
seek foreign support, first in Palestine, then at Nicomedia), and in
particular addressed a long letter to Alexander, bishop of Byzantium
(Thdt. *H. E*. i. 4), Eusebius called a council at Nicomedia, which
issued letters in favour of Arius to many bishops, and urged Alexander
himself to receive him to communion. Meanwhile a fresh complication had
appeared in Egypt. Colluthus, whose name stands first among the
signatures to the memorandum (to be mentioned presently) of the
deposition of Arius, impatient it would seem at the moderation of
Alexander, founded a schism of his own, and although merely a presbyter,
took upon himself to ordain. In Egypt and abroad confusion reigned:
parties formed in every city, bishops, to adopt the simile of Eusebius
(*Vit. Const.*), collided like the fabled Symplegades, the most sacred
of subjects were bandied about in the mouths of the populace, Christian
and heathen.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p7"></span>In all this confusion Athanasius was ready
with his convictions. His sure instinct and powerful grasp of the centre
of the question made him the mainstay of his Bishop in the painful
conflict. At a stage <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) of it difficult
to determine with precision, Alexander sent out to the bishops of the
Church at large a concise and carefully-worded memorandum of the
decision of the Egyptian Synod of 321, fortified by the signatures of
the clergy of Alexandria and the Mareotis (see *infra*, pp. 68–71).

<span id="v.ii.ii-p9"></span>This weighty document, so different in
thought and style from the letter of Alexander preserved by Theodoret,
bears the clear stamp of the mind and character of Athanasius: it
contains the germ of which his whole series of anti-Arian writings are
the expansion (see introd. and notes, pp. 68–71), and is a significant
comment on the hint of the Egyptian. bishops (*Apol. c. Ar.* 6 *ad
init*.).

<span id="v.ii.ii-p10"></span>Early in 324 a new actor came upon the
scene. Hosius, bishop of Cordova and confessor (he is referred to, not
by name, *Vit. Const*. ii. 63, 73, cf. iii. 7, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.ii-p10.1"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.ii-p10.2"></span>πάνυ βοώμενος</span>; by name, Socr. i. 7),
arrived with a letter from the Emperor himself, intreating both parties
to make peace, <span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span> <span
id="v.ii.ii-Page_xvii"></span>and treating the matter as one of trivial
moment. The letter may have been written upon information furnished by
Eusebius (D.C.B. *s.v*.); but the anxiety of the Emperor for the peace
of his new dominions is its keynote. On the arrival of Hosius a council
(p. 140) was held, which produced little effect as far as the main
question was concerned: but the claims of Colluthus were absolutely
disallowed, and his ordination of one Ischyras (*infr*. §5) to the
presbyterate pronounced null and void. Hosius apparently carried back
with him a strong report in favour of Alexander; at any rate the Emperor
is credited (*Gelas. Cyz*. ii., Hard. *Conc*. i. 451–458) with a
vehement letter of rebuke to Arius, possibly at this juncture. Such was
the state of affairs which led to the imperial resolve, probably at the
suggestion of Hosius, to summon a council of bishops from the whole
world to decide the doctrinal question, as well as the relatively lesser
matters in controversy.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p5"></span> It is of interest to note the changed
conditions. In 260 bishop Dionysius had to check the Monarchian tendency
in Libya, and was accused by members of his own flock of separating the
Son from the Being (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.ii-p5.2"></span>οὐσία</span>) of the Father. In 319 a Libyan,
Arius, cries out upon the Sabellianism of his bishop, and formulates the
very doctrine which Dionysius had been accused of maintaining.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[xvi:5](2040014.htm#fr_4.md) <span
id="v.ii.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.ii-p8"></span> The chronology cannot be determined with
precision. The Memorandum is signed by Colluthus and therefore precedes
his schism. The letter to Alex. Byzant. was written after the Colluthian
schism had begun. But the proceedings of Eusebius described above had at
least begun when the Memorandum was circulated, which must, therefore,
have been some time after the Synod of 321. The letter of Alexander to
his clergy prefixed to the *depositio* was drawn up after it, and
includes the names of the Mareotic seceders. We may, therefore,
tentatively adopt the following series:—321 <span class="c10"><span
id="v.ii.ii-p8.2"></span>a.d.</span>: Egyptian Synod deposes Arius.
Arius in correspondence with Eusebius, &c. Leaves Alexandria for
Palestine and Nicomedia. Letters sent abroad by Alexander. Eusebius
holds council and writes to Alexander. 322: Memorandum drawn up;
Alexandrian clergy assemble to sign it; prefatory address to them by
Alexander with reference to the Mareotic defection which has just
occurred; circulation of Memorandum; schism of Colluthus. 323: Letter of
Alexander to Alexander of Byzantium; (Sept.) Constantine, master of the
East, and ready to intervene in the controversy.
