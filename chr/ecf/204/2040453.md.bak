<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Letter LVI</span>.—*To the Emperor
Jovian.*

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p2.1"></span>Copy</span> of a letter of the Emperor
Jovian, sent to Athanasius, the most holy Archbishop of Alexandria.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p3"></span>To the most religious and friend of
God, Athanasius, Jovian.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p4"></span>Admiring exceedingly the achievements
of your most honourable life, and of your likeness to the God of all,
and of your affection toward our Saviour Christ, we accept you, most
honoured bishop. And inasmuch as you have not flinched from all labour,
nor from the fear of your persecutors, and, regarding dangers and
threats of the sword as dung, holding the rudder of the orthodox faith
which is dear to you, are contending even until now for the truth, and
continue to exhibit yourself as a pattern to all the people of the
faithful, and an example of virtue:—our imperial Majesty recalls you,
and desires that you should return to the office of the teaching of
salvation. Return then to the holy Churches, and tend the people of God,
and send up to God with zeal your prayers for our clemency. For we know
that by your supplication we, and all who hold with us \[the Christian
faith\], shall have great assistance from the supreme God.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p5"></span>56. *Letter of Athanasius to
Jovian <span id="fr_4672"></span>[4673](#fn_4672.md) concerning the Faith.*

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p7"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p7.1"></span>A desire</span> to learn and a yearning
for heavenly things is suitable to a religious Emperor; for thus you
will truly have ‘your heart’ also ‘in the hand of God <span
id="fr_4673"></span>[4674](#fn_4673.md) .’ Since then your Piety
desired <span id="fr_4674"></span>[4675](#fn_4674.md) to learn from us the
faith of the Catholic Church, giving thanks for these things to the
Lord, we counselled above all things to remind your Piety of the faith
confessed by the Fathers at Nicæa. For this certain set at nought, while
plotting against us in many ways, because we would not comply with the
Arian heresy, and they have become authors of heresy and schisms in the
Catholic Church. For the true and pious faith in the Lord has become
manifest to all, being both ‘known and read <span
id="fr_4675"></span>[4676](#fn_4675.md) ’ from the Divine Scriptures. For
in it both the saints were made perfect and suffered martyrdom, and now
are departed in the Lord; and the faith would have abode inviolate
always had not the wickedness of certain heretics presumed to tamper
with it. For a certain Arius and those with him attempted to corrupt it,
and to introduce impiety in its place, affirming that the Son of God was
from nought, and a creature, and a thing made and changeable. But with
these words they deceived many, so that even ‘they that seemed to be
somewhat were carried away <span id="fr_4676"></span>[4677](#fn_4676.md) ,’
with their blasphemy. And yet our holy Fathers, as we said before, came
promptly together at the Synod at Nicæa, and anathematised them, and
confessed in writing the faith of the Catholic Church, so that, this
being everywhere preached, the heresy kindled by the heretics might be
quenched. This faith then was everywhere in every Church sincerely known
and preached. But since now certain who wish to renew the Arian heresy
have presumed to set at nought this faith confessed at Nicæa by the
Fathers, and while pretending to confess it, do in fact deny it,
explaining away the ‘Coessential <span
id="fr_4677"></span>[4678](#fn_4677.md) ,’ and blaspheming of their own
accord <span id="fr_4678"></span>[4679](#fn_4678.md) against the Holy
Spirit, in affirming that It is a creature, and came into being as a
<span id="page_568">p. 568</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-Page_568"></span>thing made by the Son, we hasten as
of bounden duty, in view of the injury resulting to the people from such
blasphemy, to hand to your Piety the faith confessed at Nicæa; in order
that thy religiousness may know what has been written with all accuracy,
and how far wrong they are who teach contrary to it.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p14"></span>2. For know, most religious
Augustus, that these things have been preached from time immemorial, and
this faith the Fathers who met at Nicæa confessed; and to it have
assented all the Churches in every quarter, both those in Spain, and
Britain, and the Gauls, and all Italy and Dalmatia, Dacia and Mœsia,
Macedonia and all Greece, and in all Africa and Sardinia, and Cyprus and
Crete, as well as Pamphylia, Lycia and Isauria, and those in Egypt and
the Libyas, Pontus and Cappadocia, and those near at hand to us <span
id="fr_4679"></span>[4680](#fn_4679.md) , and the Churches in the East,
except a few who hold with Arius. For of all those above mentioned we
have both learnt the opinion by experience, and we have letters. And you
know, O most religious Augustus, that even if some few speak against
this faith, they cannot create a demurrer <span
id="fr_4680"></span>[4681](#fn_4680.md) , inasmuch as the whole world <span
id="fr_4681"></span>[4682](#fn_4681.md) holds the Apostolic faith. For they
having long been infected by the Arian heresy, now the more obstinately
oppose the truth. And that your Piety may know, although you know
already, yet we hasten to append the faith confessed by the Bishops at
Nicæa. The faith then confessed at Nicæa by the Fathers is as follows:—

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p18"></span>3. We believe <span
id="fr_4682"></span>[4683](#fn_4682.md) , &c., &c.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p20"></span>4. By this faith, Augustus, all must
needs abide, as Divine and Apostolic, and none must unsettle it by
plausibilities, and contentions about words, which is what the Arian
madmen have done, saying that the Son of God is from nought, and that
once there was when He was not, and that He is created, and made and
changeable. For for this cause, as we said before, the Synod at Nicæa
anathematised such heresy, but confessed the faith of the truth. For
they have not merely said that the Son is like <span
id="fr_4683"></span>[4684](#fn_4683.md) the Father, lest He should be
believed merely like God, instead of Very God from God; but they wrote
‘Coessential,’ which was peculiar to a genuine and true Son, truly and
naturally from the Father. Nor yet did they make the Holy Spirit alien
from the Father and the Son, but rather glorified Him together with the
Father and the Son, in the one faith of the Holy Triad, because there is
in the Holy Triad also one Godhead.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p22"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p22.1"></span>Appendix to Letter LVI.</span>

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p23"></span>Petition made at Antioch to Jovian
the Emperor on the part of Lucius <span
id="fr_4684"></span>[4685](#fn_4684.md) and Bernicianus, and certain other
Arians against Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p25"></span>First Petition which they made as
the Emperor was departing to Camp, at the Roman Gate.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p26"></span>May it please your Might and your
Majesty and your Piety to hear us. *The Emperor:* ‘Who are you and where
from?’ *The Arians:* ‘Christians, my Lord.’ *Emperor:* ‘Where from, and
from what city?’ *The Arians:* ‘Alexandria.’—*Emperor:* ‘What do you
want?’ *The Arians:* ‘May it please your Might and your Majesty, give us
a Bishop.’ *Emperor:* ‘I ordered the former one, whom you had before,
Athanasius, to occupy the See.’ *The Arians:* ‘May it please your Might:
he has been many years both in banishment, and under accusation.’
Suddenly a soldier answered in indignation: ‘May it please your Majesty,
enquire of them who they are and where from, for these are the leavings
and refuse of Cappadocia, the remains of that unholy George who
desolated the city and the world.’ The Emperor on hearing this set spurs
to his horse, and departed to the Camp.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p27"></span>Second Petition of the Arians.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p28"></span>‘We have accusations and clear
proofs against Athanasius, in that ten and twenty years ago he was
deprived by the ever memorable Constantine and Constantius, and incurred
banishment under the most religious and philosophical and blessed
Julian.’ *Emperor:* ‘Accusations ten, twenty, and thirty years old are
now obsolete. Don’t speak to me about Athanasius, for I know why he was
accused, and how he was banished.’

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p29"></span>Third Petition of the Arians.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p30"></span>‘And now again, we have certain
other accusations against Athanasius.’ *Emperor:* ‘The rights of the
case will not appear by means of crowded numbers, and clamours, but
choose two from yourselves, and from the party of the majority other
two, for I cannot answer each one severally.’ *Those from the majority:*
‘These are the leavings from the unholy George, who desolated our
province, and who would not allow a counsellor to dwell in the cities.’
*The Arians:* ‘May it please you, any one you will except Athanasius.’
*Emperor:* ‘I told you that the case of Athanasius was already settled,’
(and then angrily) ‘feri, feri <span
id="fr_4685"></span>[4686](#fn_4685.md) !’ *The Arians:* ‘May it please
you, if you send Athanasius, our city is ruined, and no one assembles
with him.’ *Emperor:* ‘Yet I took pains, and ascertained that he holds
right opinions and is orthodox, and teaches aright.’ *The Arians:* ‘With
his mouth he utters what is right, but in his soul he harbours guile.’
*Emperor:* ‘That will do, you have testified of him, that he utters what
is right and teaches aright, but if he teaches and speaks aright with
his tongue, but harbours evil thoughts in his soul, it concerns him
before God. For we are men, and hear what is said; but what is in the
heart God knows.’ *The Arians:* ‘Authorise our holding communion
together.’ *Emperor:* ‘Why, who prevents you?’ *The Arians:* ‘May it
please you, he proclaims us as sectarians and dogmatisers.’ *Emperor:*
‘It is his duty, and that of those who teach aright.’ *The Arians:* ‘May
it please your Might; we cannot bear this man, and he has taken <span
id="page_569">p. 569</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-Page_569"></span>away the lands of the Churches.’
Emperor: ‘Oh then, it is on account of property you are come here, and
not on account of the faith’—then he added—‘go away, and keep the
peace.’ Once more he added to the Arians: ‘Go away to the Church,
to-morrow you have a Communion, and after the dismissal, there are
Bishops here, and here is Nemesinus <span
id="fr_4686"></span>[4687](#fn_4686.md) , each one of you shall sign as he
believes: Athanasius is here too; whoever does not know the word of
faith, let him learn from Athanasius. You have to-morrow and the day
after, for I am going out to Camp.’ And a certain lawyer <span
id="fr_4687"></span>[4688](#fn_4687.md) belonging to the Cynics petitioned
the Emperor: ‘May it please your Majesty, on account of Bishop
Athanasius, the Receiver-General <span
id="fr_4688"></span>[4689](#fn_4688.md) seized my houses.’ *Emperor:* ‘If
the Receiver-General seized your houses what has that to do with
Athanasius?’ Another lawyer, Patalas, said: ‘I have a complaint against
Athanasius.’ *Emperor:* ‘And what have you to do with Christians, being
a heathen?’ But certain of the majority of them of Antioch took Lucius
and brought him to the Emperor, saying: ‘May it please your Might and
your Majesty, look whom they wanted to make a Bishop!’

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p35"></span>*Another petition made at the porch
of the palace <span id="fr_4689"></span>[4690](#fn_4689.md) on the part of
Lucius:*—‘May it please your Might, listen to me.’ The Emperor stopped
and said: ‘I ask you, Lucius, how did you come here, by sea or by land?’
*Lucius:* ‘May it please you, by sea.’ *Emperor:* ‘Well, Lucius, may the
God of the world, and the radiant sun, and moon, be angry with those men
that made the voyage with you, for not casting you into the sea; and may
that ship never again have fair winds, nor find a haven with her
passengers when in a storm.’ And through Euzoius <span
id="fr_4690"></span>[4691](#fn_4690.md) the unbelieving Arians asked
Probatius and his fellows, the successors of Eusebius <span
id="fr_4691"></span>[4692](#fn_4691.md) and Bardio as eunuchs, that they
might be granted an audience. The Emperor learned this, and tortured the
eunuchs and said: ‘If any one wants to make a petition against
Christians let this be his fate.’ And so the Emperor dismissed them.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.xi-p6"></span> Cf. Prolegg, ch. ii. §9, and ch. v.
§3, h. and *supr.* p. 487. Athanasius, on the first news of Julian’s
death, by a secret and rapid journey, succeeded in meeting Jovian, when
still beyond the Euphrates on his return from the East. He thus secured
the ear of the new Emperor before the Arian deputation from Alexandria
could reach him. The letter before us (Migne xxvi. 813) was drawn up at
Antioch, as it would seem in response to a request from Jovian on a
doctrinal statement. The short letter of Jovian prefixed to the Epistle
is a formal authorisation for the bishop’s return to his see, with
which, taught by his experience under Julian, he was careful to arm
himself. The documents given as an appendix are notes made at Antioch,
and carefully preserved, of the reception given by Jovian to the Arian
deputation. They are probably the ‘exemplaria’ referred to in *Hist.
Aceph.* §14 (see note there). They are characteristic, and interesting
in many ways; among others, as shewing how accurately Jovian had been
primed by Athanasius with the leading facts of his case.

‘and you will peacefully enjoy a long reign:’ probably the words were
erased from our text on account of Jovian’s premature death. If genuine,
they stamp the prediction *supr.* p. 487, as, at least in part, a
