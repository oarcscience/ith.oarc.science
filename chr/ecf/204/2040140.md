<span id="vii.ii.xliii"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.xliii-p1"></span> §43. *He came in human rather than in
any nobler form, because (I) He came to save, not to impress ; (2) man
alone of creatures had sinned. As men would not recognise His works in
the Universe, He came and worked among them as Man; in the sphere to
which they had limited themselves.*

<span id="vii.ii.xliii-p2"></span>Now, if they ask, Why then did He not
appear by means of other and nobler parts of creation, and use some
nobler instrument, as the sun, or moon, or stars, or fire, or air,
instead of man merely? let them know that the Lord came not to make a
display, but to heal and teach those who were suffering. 2. For the way
for one aiming at display would be, just to appear, and to dazzle the
beholders; but for one seeking to heal and teach the way is, not simply
to sojourn here, but to give himself to the aid of those in want, and to
appear as they who need him can bear it; that he may not, by exceeding
the requirements of the sufferers, trouble the very persons that need
him, rendering God’s appearance useless to them. 3. Now, nothing in
creation had gone astray with regard to their notions of God, save man
only. Why, neither sun, nor moon, nor heaven, nor the stars, nor water,
nor air had swerved from their order; but knowing their Artificer and
Sovereign, the Word, they remain as they were made <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) . But men alone, having rejected what
was good, then devised things of nought instead of the truth, and have
ascribed the honour due to God, and their knowledge of Him, to demons
and men in the shape of stones. 4. With reason, then, since it were
unworthy of the Divine Goodness to overlook so grave a matter, while yet
men were not able to recognise Him <span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span
id="vii.ii.xliii-Page_60"></span>as ordering and guiding the whole, He
takes to Himself as an instrument a part of the whole, His human body,
and unites <span id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md) Himself with that, in
order that since men could not recognise Him in the whole, they should
not fail to know Him in the part; and since they could not look up to
His invisible power, might be able, at any rate, from what resembled
themselves to reason to Him and to contemplate Him. 5. For, men as they
are, they will be able to know His Father more quickly and directly by a
body of like nature and by the divine works wrought through it, judging
by comparison that they are not human, but the works of God, which are
done by Him. 6. And if it were absurd, as they say, for the Word to be
known through the works of the body, it would likewise be absurd for Him
to be known through the works of the universe. For just as He is in
creation, and yet does not partake of its nature in the least degree,
but rather all things partake <span id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) of
His power; so while He used the body as His instrument He partook of no
corporeal property, but, on the contrary, Himself sanctified even the
body. 7. For if even Plato, who is in such repute among the Greeks,
says <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md) that its author, beholding
the universe tempest-tossed, and in peril of going down to the place of
chaos, takes his seat at the helm of the soul and comes to the rescue
and corrects all its calamities; what is there incredible in what we
say, that, mankind being in error, the Word lighted down <span
id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) upon it and appeared as man, that He
might save it in its tempest by His guidance and goodness?

[Next: As God made man by a word, why not restore him by a word? But (1)
creation out of nothing is different from reparation of what already
exists. (2) Man was there with a definite need, calling for a definite
remedy. Death was ingrained in man's nature: He then must wind life
closely to human nature. Therefore the Word became Incarnate that He
might meet and conquer death in His usurped territory. (Simile of straw
and asbestos.)](2040141.md)
