<span id="xviii.ii.xxviii-p1"></span> 28. *The news of the intrusion of
George.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xxviii-p2"></span>The rest of their proceedings will
perhaps be thought incredible, and will fill all men with astonishment,
by reason of their extreme atrocity. It is necessary however to speak of
them, in order that your Christian zeal and piety may perceive that
their slanders and calumnies against us are framed for no other end,
than that they may drive us out of the Churches, and introduce their own
impiety in our place. For when the lawful Bishops, men of advanced age,
had some of them been banished, and others forced to fly, heathens and
catechumens, those who hold the first places in the senate and men who
are notorious for their wealth, were straightway commissioned by the
Arians to preach the holy faith instead of Christians <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364.md) . And enquiry was no longer made,
as the Apostle enjoined, ‘if any be blameless <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365.md) :’ but according to the practice of
the impious Jeroboam, he who could give most money was named Bishop; and
it made no difference to them, even if the man happened to be a heathen,
so long as he furnished them with money. Those who had been Bishops from
the time of Alexander, monks and ascetics, were banished: and men
practised only in calumny corrupted, as far as in them lay, the
Apostolic rule, and polluted the Churches. Truly their false accusations
against us have gained them much, that they should be able to commit
iniquity, and to do such things as these in your time; so that the words
of Scripture may be applied to them, ‘Woe unto those through whom My
name is blasphemed among the Gentiles <span
id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366.md) .’
