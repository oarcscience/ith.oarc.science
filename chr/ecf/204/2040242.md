<span id="xvi.ii.xxxi-p1"></span> 69. And once also the Arians having
lyingly asserted that Antony’s opinions were the same as theirs, he was
displeased and wroth against them. Then being summoned by the bishops
and all the brethren, he descended from the mountain, and having entered
Alexandria <span id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md) , he denounced the
Arians, saying that their heresy was the last of all and a forerunner of
Antichrist. And he taught the people that the Son of God was not a
created being, neither had He come into being from non-existence, but
that He was the Eternal Word and Wisdom of the Essence of the Father.
And therefore it was impious to say, ‘there was a time when He was not,’
for the Word was always co-existent with the Father. Wherefore have no
fellowship with the most impious Arians. For there is no communion
between light and darkness <span id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md) .
For you are good Christians, but they, when they say that the Son of the
Father, the Word of God, is a created being, differ in nought from the
heathen, since they worship that which is created, rather than God the
creator <span id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md) . But believe ye that
the Creation itself is angry with them because they number the Creator,
the Lord of all, by whom all things came into being, with those things
which were originated.

argument much used against Arianism. Antony’s arguments may be compared
with those of Ath. in *Ep. Æg.* 13.
