<span id="xvi.ii.xx-p1"></span> 55. So after certain days he went in
again to the mountain. And henceforth many resorted to him, and others
who were suffering ventured to go in. To all the monks therefore who
came to him, he continually gave this precept: ‘Believe on the Lord and
love Him; keep yourselves from filthy thoughts and fleshly pleasures,
and as it is written in the Proverbs, be not deceived “by the fulness of
the belly <span id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097.md) .” Pray
continually; avoid vain<span id="page_211">p. 211</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.xx-Page_211"></span>glory; sing psalms before sleep and on
awaking; hold in your heart the commandments of Scripture; be mindful of
the works of the saints that your souls being put in remembrance of the
commandments may be brought into harmony with the zeal of the saints.’
And especially he counselled them to meditate continually on the
apostle’s word, ‘Let not the sun go down upon your wrath <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098.md) .’ And he considered this was
spoken of all commandments in common, and that not on wrath alone, but
not on any other sin of ours, ought the sun to go down. For it was good
and needful that neither the sun should condemn us for an evil by day
nor the moon for a sin by night, or even for an evil thought. That this
state may be preserved in us it is good to hear the apostle and keep his
words, for he says, ‘Try your own selves and prove your own selves <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099.md) .’ Daily, therefore, let each one
take from himself the tale of his actions both by day and night; and if
he have sinned, let him cease from it; while if he have not, let him not
be boastful. But let him abide in that which is good, without being
negligent, nor condemning his neighbours, nor justifying himself, ‘until
the Lord come who searcheth out hidden things <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100.md) ,’ as saith the blessed apostle
Paul. For often unawares we do things that we know not of; but the Lord
seeth all things. Wherefore committing the judgment to Him, let us have
sympathy one with another. Let us bear each other’s burdens <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101.md) : but let us examine our own selves
and hasten to fill up that in which we are lacking. And as a safeguard
against sin let the following be observed. Let us each one note and
write down our actions and the impulses of our soul as though we were
going to relate them to each other. And be assured that if we should be
utterly ashamed to have them known, we shall abstain from sin and
harbour no base thoughts in our mind. For who wishes to be seen while
sinning? or who will not rather lie after the commission of a sin,
through the wish to escape notice? As then while we are looking at one
another, we would not commit carnal sin, so if we record our thoughts as
though about to tell them to one another, we shall the more easily keep
ourselves free from vile thoughts through shame lest they should be
known. Wherefore let that which is written be to us in place of the eyes
of our fellow hermits, that blushing as much to write as if we had been
caught, we may never think of what is unseemly. Thus fashioning
ourselves we shall be able to keep the body in subjection, to please the
Lord, and to trample on the devices of the enemy.

<span id="xvi.ii.xx-p7"></span>56. This was the advice he gave to those
who came to him. And with those who suffered he sympathised and prayed.
And oft-times the Lord heard him on behalf of many: yet he boasted not
because he was heard, nor did he murmur if he were not. But always he
gave the Lord thanks and besought the sufferer to be patient, and to
know that healing belonged neither to him nor to man at all, but only to
the Lord, who doeth good when and to whom He will. The sufferers
therefore used to receive the words of the old man as though they were a
cure, learning not to be downhearted but rather to be long-suffering.
And those who were healed were taught not to give thanks to Antony but
to God alone.
