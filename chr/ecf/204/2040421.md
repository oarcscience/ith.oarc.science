<span id="xxv.iii.iii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.x-p1.1"></span>\*XII</span>.—*(Probably for 340 <span
class="c10"><span id="xxv.iii.iii.x-p1.2"></span>a.d.</span>) To the
Beloved Brother, and our fellow Minister Serapion* <span
id="fr_4352"></span>[4353](#fn_4352.md) .

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.x-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.x-p3.1"></span>Thanks</span> be to Divine Providence for
those things which, at all times, it vouchsafes to us; for it has
vouchsafed to us now to come to the season of the festival. Having,
therefore, according to custom, written the Letter respecting the
festival, I have sent it to you, my beloved; that through you all the
brethren may be able to know the day of rejoicing. But because some
Meletians, being come from Syria, have boasted that they had received
what does not belong to them, I mean, that they also were reckoned in
the Catholic Church; on this account, I have sent to you a copy of one
letter of our fellow-ministers who are of Palestine, that when it
reaches you, you may know the fraud of the pretenders in this matter.
For because they boasted, as I have said before, it was necessary for me
to write to the Bishops who are in Syria, and immediately those of
Palestine sent us a reply, having agreed in <span
id="fr_4353"></span>[4354](#fn_4353.md) the judgment against them, as you
may learn from this example. That you may not have to consider the
letters of all the Bishops one after the other, I have sent you one,
which is of like character with the rest, in order that from it you may
know the purport of all of them. I know also that when they are
convicted in this matter, they will incur perfect odium at the hands of
all men. And thus far concerning the pretenders. But I have further
deemed it highly necessary and very urgent, to make known to your
modesty—for I have written this to each one—that you should proclaim the
fast of forty days to the brethren, and persuade them to fast, lest,
while all the world is fasting, we who are in Egypt should be derided,
as the only people who do not fast, but take our pleasure in these days.
For if, on account of the Letter \[not\] being yet read, we do not fast,
we should take away this pretext, and it should be read before the fast
of forty days, so that they may not make this an excuse for neglect or
fasting. Also, when it is read, they may be able to learn about the
fast. But O, my beloved, whether in this way or any other, persuade and
teach them to fast the forty days. For it is a disgrace that when all
the world does this, those alone who are in Egypt, instead of fasting,
should find their pleasure. For even I being grieved because men deride
us for this, have been constrained to write to you. When therefore you
receive the letters, and have read them and given the exhortation, write
to me in return, my beloved, that I also may rejoice upon learning it.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.x-p5"></span>2. But I have also thought it
necessary to inform <span id="fr_4354"></span>[4355](#fn_4354.md) you of
the fact, that Bishops have suc<span id="page_539">p. 539</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iii.x-Page_539"></span>ceeded those who have fallen asleep.
In Tanis in the stead of Elias <span
id="fr_4355"></span>[4356](#fn_4355.md) , is Theodorus. In Arsenoitis,
Silvanus <span id="fr_4356"></span>[4357](#fn_4356.md) instead of
Calosiris. In Paralus, Nemesion is instead of Nonnus <span
id="fr_4357"></span>[4358](#fn_4357.md) . In Bucolia <span
id="fr_4358"></span>[4359](#fn_4358.md) is Heraclius. In Tentyra,
Andronicus is instead of Saprion <span
id="fr_4359"></span>[4360](#fn_4359.md) , his father. In Thebes, Philon
instead of Philon. In Maximianopolis, Herminus instead of Atras. In the
lower Apollon is Sarapion instead of Plution. In Aphroditon, Serenus is
in the place of Theodorus. In Rhinocoruron, Salomon. In Stathma,
Arabion, and in Marmarica. In the eastern Garyathis, Andragathius <span
id="fr_4360"></span>[4361](#fn_4360.md) in the place of Hierax. In the
southern Garyathis, Quintus <span id="fr_4361"></span>[4362](#fn_4361.md)
instead of Nicon <span id="fr_4362"></span>[4363](#fn_4362.md) . So that to
these you may write, and from these receive the canonical Letters.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.x-p15"></span>Salute one another with a holy kiss.
All the brethren who are with me salute you.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.x-p16"></span>He wrote this from Rome. There is no
twelfth Letter.

is in the <span class="c10"><span

remark at the end of it, that there is no twelfth; together with the
exhortations concerning fasting contained in it, was probably written in
lieu of a twelfth. Serapion was doubtless the Bishop of Thmuis (see
*Letter* 54).

situate in Augustamnica Prima. Vid. Quatremère *Mémoires geogr. et
histor. sur l’Egypte,* tom. i. p. 284, &c. (L.) The word <span
class="Greek"><span id="xxv.iii.iii.x-p7.2"></span>Τάνις</span> is the
LXX. rendering of ‘Zoan.’ In the *Apol. c. Ar.* 50, we have a list of
ninety-four Egyptian Bishops, among others, who subscribed to the letter
of the Council of Sardica. A reference to this list explains some names
which otherwise would have been obscure. For a list of the Egyptian
Bishoprics, the reader is referred to Neale’s *Hist. of the Holy Eastern
Church.* Gen. Introd. vol. i. pp. 115, 116. To the list there given must
be added the names of Bucolia, Stathma, the Eastern Garyathis, the
Southern Garyathis. There were two Egyptian Bishops named Elias who
subscribed their names to the letter of the Council of Sardica.

of Bucolia, see the treatise by Quatremère, already referred, to (tom.

Bucolies est, si je ne me trompe, parfaitement identique avec la
province de Baschmour.
