<span id="xviii.ii.xxxiv-p1"></span> 34. *He expostulates with
Constantius.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xxxiv-p2"></span>Now when such enormities as these
were again perpetrated by the Arians, I surely was not wrong in
complying with the direction of Holy Scripture, which says, ‘Hide
thyself for a little moment, until the wrath of the Lord be
overpast <span id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384.md) .’ This was another
reason for my withdrawing myself, Augustus, most beloved of God; and I
refused not, either to depart into the desert, or, if need were, to be
let down from a wall in a basket <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385.md) . I endured everything, I even
dwelt among wild beasts, that your favour might return to me, waiting
for an opportunity to offer to you this my defence, confident as I am
that they will be condemned, and your goodness manifested unto me. O,
Augustus, blessed and most beloved of God, what would you have had me to
do? to come to you while my calumniators were inflamed with rage against
me, and were seeking to kill me; or, as it is written, to hide myself a
little, that in the mean time they might be condemned as heretics, and
your goodness might be manifested unto me? or would you have had me,
Sire, to appear before your magistrates, in order that though you had
written merely in the way of threatening, they not understanding your
intention, but being exasperated against me by the Arians, might kill me
on the authority of your letters, and on that ground ascribe the murder
to you? It would neither have been becoming in me to surrender, and give
myself up that my blood might be shed, nor in you, as a Christian King,
to have the murder of Christians, and those too Bishops, imputed unto
you.
