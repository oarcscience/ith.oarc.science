<span id="vii.ii.xxiii-p1"></span> §23. *Necessity of a public death for
the doctrine of the Resurrection.*

<span id="vii.ii.xxiii-p2"></span>But even if, without any disease and
without any pain, He had hidden His body away privily and by Himself
“in <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) a corner,” or in a desert
place, or in a house, or anywhere, and afterwards suddenly appeared and
said that He had been raised from the dead, He would have seemed on all
hands to be telling idle tales <span id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) ,
and what He said about the Resurrection would have been all the more
discredited, as there was no one at all to witness to His death. Now,
death must precede resurrection, as it would be no resurrection did not
death precede; so that if the death of His body had taken place anywhere
in secret, the death not being apparent nor taking place before
witnesses, His Resurrection too had been hidden and without evidence. 2.
Or why, while when He had risen He proclaimed the Resurrection, should
He cause His death to take place in secret? or why, while He drove out
evil spirits in the presence of all, and made the man blind from his
birth recover his sight, <span id="page_49">p. 49</span> <span
id="vii.ii.xxiii-Page_49"></span>and changed the water into wine, that
by these means He might be believed to be the Word of God, should He not
manifest His mortal nature as incorruptible in the presence of all, that
He might be believed Himself to be the Life? 3. Or how were His
disciples to have boldness in speaking of the Resurrection, were they
not able to say that He first died? Or how could they be believed,
saying that death had first taken place and then the Resurrection, had
they not had as witnesses of His death the men before whom they spoke
with boldness? For if, even as it was, when His death and Resurrection
had taken place in the sight of all, the Pharisees of that day would not
believe, but compelled even those who had seen the Resurrection to deny
it, why, surely, if these things had happened in secret, how many
pretexts for disbelief would they have devised? 4. Or how could the end
of death, and the victory over it be proved, unless challenging it
before the eyes of all He had shewn it to be dead, annulled for the
future by the incorruption of His body?

[Next: Further objections anticipated. He did not choose His manner of
death; for He was to prove Conqueror of death in all or any of its
forms: (simile of a good wrestler). The death chosen to disgrace Him
proved the Trophy against death: moreover it preserved His body
undivided.](2040121.md)
