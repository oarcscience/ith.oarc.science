<span id="vii.ii.xlvii-p1"></span> §47. *The numerous oracles,—fancied
apparitions in sacred places, &c., dispelled by the sign of the Cross.
The old gods prove to have been mere men. Magic is exposed. And whereas
Philosophy could only persuade select and local cliques of Immortality,
and goodness,—men of little intellect have infused into the multitudes
of the churches the principle of a supernatural life.*

<span id="vii.ii.xlvii-p2"></span>And whereas formerly every place was
full of the deceit of the oracles <span
id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md) , and the oracles at Delphi and
Dodona, and in Bœotia <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332.md) and
Lycia <span id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md) and Libya <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) and Egypt and those of the
Cabiri <span id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md) , and the Pythoness, were
held in repute by men’s imagination, now, since Christ has begun to be
preached everywhere, their madness also has ceased and there is none
among them to divine any more. 2. And whereas formerly demons used to
deceive <span id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md) men’s fancy, occupying
springs or rivers, trees or stones, and thus imposed upon the simple by
their juggleries; now, after the divine visitation of the Word, their
deception has ceased. For by the Sign of the Cross, though a man but use
it, he drives out their deceits. 3. And while formerly men held to be
gods the Zeus and Cronos and Apollo and the heroes mentioned in the
poets, and went astray in honouring them; now that the Saviour has
appeared among men, those others have been exposed as mortal men <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) , and Christ alone has been recognised
among men as the true God, the Word of God. 4. And what is one to say of
the magic <span id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) esteemed among them?
that before the Word sojourned among us this was strong and active among
Egyptians, and Chaldees, and Indians, and inspired awe in those who saw
it; but that by the presence of the Truth, and the Appearing of the
Word, it also has been thoroughly confuted, and brought wholly to
nought. 5. But as to Gentile wisdom, and the sounding pretensions of the
philosophers, I think none can need our argument, since the wonder is
before the eyes of all, that while the wise among the Greeks had written
so much, and were unable to persuade even a few <span
id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md) from their own neighbourhood,
concerning immortality and a virtuous life, Christ alone, by ordinary
language, and by men not clever with the tongue, has throughout all the
world persuaded whole churches full of men to despise death, and to mind
the things of immortality; to overlook what is temporal and to turn
their eyes to what is eternal; to think nothing of earthly glory and to
strive only for the heavenly.

<span id="vii.ii.xlvii-p11"></span> In Plato’s ideal Republic, the
notion of any direct influence of the highest ideals upon the masses is
quite absent. Their happiness is to be in passive obedience to the few
whom those ideals inspire. (Contrast [Isa. liv.
13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md)<span
id="vii.ii.xlvii-p11.2"></span>, [Jer. xxxi.

Power shews Himself more than a man, more than a magician, more than a
