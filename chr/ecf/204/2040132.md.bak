<span id="vii.ii.xxxv-p1"></span> §35. *Prophecies of the Cross. How
these prophecies are satisfied in Christ alone.*

<span id="vii.ii.xxxv-p2"></span>But, perhaps, having heard the prophecy
of His death, you ask to learn also what is set forth concerning the
Cross. For not even this is passed over: it is displayed by the holy men
with great plainness. 2. For first Moses predicts it, and that with a
loud voice, when he <span id="page_55">p. 55</span> <span
id="vii.ii.xxxv-Page_55"></span>says: “Ye shall see <span
id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) your Life hanging before your eyes,
and shall not believe.” 3. And next, the prophets after him witness of
this, saying: “But <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) I as an
innocent lamb brought to be slain, knew it not; they counselled an evil
counsel against me, saying, Hither and let us cast a tree upon his <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) bread, and efface him from the land of
the living.” 4. And again: “They pierced <span
id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) my hands and my feet, they numbered
all my bones, they parted my garments among them, and for my vesture
they cast lots.” 5. Now a death raised aloft and that takes place on a
tree, could be none other than the Cross: and again, in no other death
are the hands and feet pierced, save on the Cross only. 6. But since by
the sojourn of the Saviour among men all nations also on every side
began to know God; they did not leave this point, either, without a
reference: but mention is made of this matter as well in the Holy
Scriptures. For “there <span id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) shall
be,” he saith, “the root of Jesse, and he that riseth to rule the
nations, on him shall the nations hope.” This then is a little in proof
of what has happened. 7. But all Scripture teems with refutations of the
disbelief of the Jews. For which of the righteous men and holy prophets,
and patriarchs, recorded in the divine Scriptures, ever had his corporal
birth of a virgin only? Or what woman has sufficed without man for the
conception of human kind? Was not Abel born of Adam, Enoch of Jared, Noe
of Lamech, and Abraham of Tharra, Isaac of Abraham, Jacob of Isaac? Was
not Judas born of Jacob, and Moses and Aaron of Ameram? Was not Samuel
born of Elkana, was not David of Jesse, was not Solomon of David, was
not Ezechias of Achaz, was not Josias of Amos, was not Esaias of Amos,
was not Jeremy of Chelchias, was not Ezechiel of Buzi? Had not each a
father as author of his existence? Who then is he that is born of a
virgin only? For the prophet made exceeding much of this sign. 8. Or
whose birth did a star in the skies forerun, to announce to the world
him that was born? For when Moses was born, he was hid by his parents:
David was not heard of, even by those of his neighbourhood, inasmuch as
even the great Samuel knew him not, but asked, had Jesse yet another
son? Abraham again became known to his neighbours as <span
id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) a great man only subsequently to his
birth. But of Christ’s birth the witness was not man, but a star in that
heaven whence He was descending.
