<span id="xviii.ii.xxxiii-p1"></span> 33. *Conduct of the Arians towards
the consecrated Virgins.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xxxiii-p2"></span>The Son of God, our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ, having become man for our sakes, and having
destroyed death, and delivered our race from the bondage of
corruption <span id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379) , in addition to
all His other benefits bestowed this also upon us, that we should
possess upon earth, in the state of virginity <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380) , a picture of the holiness of
Angels. Accordingly such as have attained this virtue, the Catholic
Church has been accustomed to call the brides of Christ. And the heathen
who see them express their admiration of them as the temples of the
Word. For indeed this holy and heavenly profession is nowhere <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381) established, but only among us
Christians, and it is a very strong argument that with us is to be found
the genuine and true religion. Your most religious father Constantine
Augustus, of blessed memory, honoured the Virgins above all the rest,
and your Piety in several letters has given them the titles of the
honourable and holy women. But now these worthy Arians who have
slandered me, and by whom conspiracies have been formed against most of
the Bishops, having obtained the consent and cooperation of the
magistrates, first stripped them, and then caused them to be suspended
upon what are called the Hermetaries <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382) , and scourged them on the ribs so
severely three several times, that not even real malefactors have ever
suffered the like. Pilate, to gratify the Jews of old, pierced one of
our Saviour’s sides with a spear. These men have exceeded the madness of
Pilate, for they have scourged not one but both His sides; for the limbs
of the Virgins are in an especial manner the Saviour’s own. All men
shudder at hearing the bare recital of deeds like these. These men alone
not only did not fear to strip and to scourge those undefiled limbs,
which the Virgins had dedicated solely to our Saviour Christ; but, what
is worse than all, when they were reproached by every one for such
extreme cruelty, instead of manifesting any shame, they pretended that
it was commanded by your Piety. So utterly presumptuous are they and
full of wicked thoughts and purposes. Such a deed as this was never
heard of in past persecutions <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383)
: or supposing that it ever occurred before, yet surely it was not
befitting either that Virginity should suffer such outrage and
dishonour, in the time of your Majesty, a Christian, or that these men
should impute to your Piety their own cruelty. Such wickedness belongs
only to heretics, to blaspheme the Son of God, and to do violence to His
holy Virgins.
