<span id="xviii.ii.xxxii-p1"></span> 32. *He defends his Flight.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xxxii-p2"></span>Hearing, nay almost seeing, these
things, through the mournful representations of the messengers, I
confess I turned back again into the desert, justly concluding, as your
Piety will perceive, that if I was sought after, that I might be sent as
soon as I was discovered to the Prefects <span
id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374.md) , I should be prevented from ever
coming to your Grace; and that if those who would not subscribe against
me, suffered so severely as they did, and the laity who refused to
communicate with the Arians were ordered for death, there was no doubt
at all but that ten thousand new modes of destruction would be devised
by the calumniators against me; and that after my death, they would
employ against whomsoever they wished to injure, whatever means they
chose, venting their lies against us the more boldly, for that then
there would no longer be any one left who could expose them. I fled, not
because I feared your Piety (for I know your long-suffering and
goodness), but because from what had taken place, I perceived the spirit
of my enemies, and considered that they would make use of all possible
means to accomplish my destruction, from fear that they would be brought
to answer for what they had done contrary to the intentions of your
Excellency. For observe, your Grace commanded that the Bishops should be
expelled only out of the cities and the province. But these worthy
persons presumed to exceed your commands, and banished aged men and
Bishops venerable for their years into desert and unfrequented and
frightful places, beyond the boundaries of three provinces <span
id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375.md) . Some of them were sent off from
Libya to the great Oasis; others from the Thebais to Ammoniaca in
Libya <span id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376.md) . Neither was it from
fear of death that I fled; let none of them condemn me as guilty of
cowardice; but because it is the injunction of our Saviour <span
id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377.md) that we should flee when we are
persecuted, and hide ourselves when we are sought after, and not expose
ourselves to certain dangers, nor by appearing before our persecutors
inflame still more their rage against us. For to give one’s self up to
one’s enemies to be murdered, is the same thing as to murder one’s self;
but to flee, as our Saviour has enjoined, is to know our time, and to
manifest a real concern for our persecutors, lest if they proceed to the
shedding of blood, they become guilty of the transgression of the law,
‘Thou <span id="page_252">p. 252</span> <span
id="xviii.ii.xxxii-Page_252"></span>shalt not kill <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md) .’ And yet these men by their
calumnies against me, earnestly wish that I should suffer death. What
they have again lately done proves that this is their desire and
murderous intention. You will be astonished, I am sure, Augustus, most
beloved of God, when you hear it; it is indeed an outrage worthy of
amazement. What it is, I pray you briefly to hear.
