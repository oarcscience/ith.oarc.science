<span id="v.ii.iii-p1"></span>§3 (1) *The Council of Nicæa.*

<span id="v.ii.iii-p2"></span>An ecumenical council was a new
experiment. Local councils had long since grown to be a recognised organ
of the Church both for legislation and for judicial proceedings. But no
precedent as yet prescribed, no ecclesiastical law or theological
principle had as yet enthroned, the ‘General Council’ as the supreme
expression of the Church’s mind. Constantine had already referred the
case of the Donatists first to a select council at Rome under bishop
Miltiades, then to what Augustine (*Ep*. 43) has been understood to call
a ‘plenarium ecclesiæ universæ concilium’ at Arles in 314. This remedy
for schism was now to be tried on a grander scale. That the heads of all
the Churches of Christendom should meet in free and brotherly
deliberation, and should testify to all the world their agreement in the
Faith handed down independently but harmoniously from the earliest times
in Churches widely remote in situation, and separated by differences of
language, race, and civilisation, is a grand and impressive idea, an
idea approximately realised at Nicæa as in no other assembly that has
ever met. The testimony of such an assembly carries the strongest
evidential weight; and the almost unanimous horror of the Nicene Bishops
at the novelty and profaneness of Arianism condemns it irrevocably as
alien to the immemorial belief of the Churches. But it was one thing to
perceive this, another to formulate the positive belief of the Church in
such a way as to exclude the heresy; one thing to agree in condemning
Arian formulæ, another to agree upon an adequate test of orthodoxy. This
was the problem which lay before the council, and with which only its
more clearsighted members tenaciously grappled: this is the explanation
of the reaction which followed, and which for more than a generation,
for well nigh half a century after, placed its results in jeopardy. The
number of bishops who met at Nicæa was over 250 <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) . They represented many nationalities
(Euseb. *ubi supra*.), but only a handful came from the West, the chief
being Hosius, Cæcilian of Carthage, and the presbyters sent by Silvester
of Rome, whose age prevented his presence in person. The council lasted
from the end of May till Aug. 25 (see D.C.A., 1389). With the many
picturesque stories told of its incidents we have nothing to do
(Stanley’s *Eastern Church*, Socr. i. 10–12, Soz. i. 17, 18, Rufin. *H.
E*. i. 3–5); but it may be well to note the division of parties. (1) Of
thoroughgoing partisans of Arius, Secundus <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) and Theonas alone scorned all compromise.
But Eusebius of Nicomedia, Theognis, Bishop of Nicæa itself, and Maris
of Chalcedon, also belonged to the inner circle of Arians by conviction
(Socr. i. 8; Soz. i. 21 makes up the same number, but wrongly). The
three last-named were pupils of Lucian (Philost. ii. 15). Some twelve
others (the chief names are Athanasius of Anazarbus and Narcissus of
Neronias, in Cilicia; Patrophilus of Scythopolis, Aetius of Lydda,
Paulinus of Tyre, Theodotus of Laodicea, Gregory of Berytus, in Syria
and Palestine; Menophantus of Ephesus; for a fuller discussion see
Gwatk. p. 31, n. 3) completed the strength of the Arian party proper.
(2) On the other hand a clearly formulated doctrinal position in
contrast to Arianism was taken up by a minority only, although this
minority carried the day. Alexander of Alexandria of course was the
rallying point of this wing, but the choice of the formula proceeded
from other minds. ‘<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p4.2"></span>γπόστασις</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p4.3"></span>οὑσία</span> are one in the Nicene formula:
Alexander in 323 writes of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p4.4"></span>τρεὶς ὐποστάσεις</span>.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p5"></span>The test formula of Nicæa was the work of
two concurrent influences, that of the anti-Origenists of the East,
especially Marcellus of Ancyra, Eustathius of Antioch, supported by
Macarius of ‘Ælia,’ Hellanicus of Tripolis, and Asclepas of Gaza, and
that of the Western bishops, especially Hosius of Cordova. The latter
fact explains the energetic intervention of <span id="page_xviii">p.
xviii</span> <span id="v.ii.iii-Page_xviii"></span>Constantine at the
critical moment on behalf of the test (see below, and *Ep. Eus*. p. 75);
the word was commended to the Fathers by Constantine, but Constantine
was ‘prompted’ by Hosius (Harnack, *Dogmg*. ii. 226); <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iii-p5.1"></span>οὗτος τὴν ἐν Νικαί& 139·
πίοτιν ἐξέθετο</span> (*infr*. p. 285, §42). Alexander (the Origenist)
had been prepared for this by Hosius beforehand (Soc. iii. 7; Philost.
i. 7; cf. Zahn *Marcell*. p. 23, and Harnack’s important note, p. 229).
Least of all was Athanasius the author of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p5.2"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p5.3"></span>μοούσιον</span>; his whole attitude toward the
famous test (*infr*. p. 303) is that of loyal acceptance and
assimilation rather than of native inward affinity. ‘He was moulded by
the Nicene Creed, did not mould it himself’ (Loofs, p. 134). The
theological keynote of the council was struck by a small minority;
Eustathius, Marcellus, perhaps Macarius, and the Westerns, above all
Hosius; the numbers were doubtless contributed by the Egyptian bishops
who had condemned Arius in 321. The signatures, which seem partly
incorrect, preserve a list of about 20. The party then which rallied
round Alexander in formal opposition to the Arians may be put down at
over thirty. ‘The men who best understood Arianism were most decided on
the necessity of its formal condemnation.’ (Gwatkin.) To this compact
and determined group the result of the council was due, and in their
struggle they owed much—how much it is hard to determine—to the energy
and eloquence of the deacon Athanasius, who had accompanied his bishop
to the council as an indispensable companion (*infr*. p. 103; Soz. i. 17
*fin*.). (3) Between the convinced Arians and their reasoned opponents
lay the great mass of the bishops, 200 and more, nearly all from Syria
and Asia Minor, who wished for nothing more than that they might hand on
to those who came after them the faith they had received at baptism, and
had learned from their predecessors. These were the ‘conservatives <span
id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) ,’ or middle party, composed of all those
who, for whatever reason, while untainted with Arianism, yet either
failed to feel its urgent danger to the Church, or else to hold steadily
in view the necessity of an adequate test if it was to be banished.
Simple shepherds like Spyridion of Cyprus; men of the world who were
more interested in their *libelli* than in the magnitude of the
doctrinal issue; theologians, a numerous class, ‘who on the basis of
half-understood Origenist ideas were prepared to recognise in Christ
only the Mediator appointed (no doubt before all ages) between God and
the World’ (Zahn *Marc*. p. 30); men who in the best of faith yet failed
from lack of intellectual clearsightedness to grasp the question for
themselves; a few, possibly, who were inclined to think that Arius was
hardly used and might be right after all; such were the main elements
which made up the mass of the council, and upon whose indefiniteness,
sympathy, or unwillingness to impose any effective test, the Arian party
based their hopes at any rate of toleration. Spokesman and leader of the
middle party was the most learned Churchman of the age, Eusebius of
Cæsarea. A devoted admirer of Origen, but independent of the school of
Lucian, he had, during the early stages of the controversy, thrown his
weight on the side of toleration for Arius. He had himself used
compromising language, and in his letter to the Cæsarean Church
(*infra*, p. 76 *sq*.) does so again. But equally strong language can be
cited from him on the other side, and belonging as he does properly to
the pre-Nicene age, it is highly invidious to make the most of his
Arianising passages, and, ignoring or explaining away those on the other
side, and depreciating his splendid and lasting services to Christian
learning, to class him summarily with his namesake of Nicomedia <span
id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) . (See Prolegg. to vol. 1 of this series,
and above all the article in D.C.B.) The fact however remains, that
Eusebius gave something more than moral support to the Arians. He was
‘neither a great man nor a clear thinker’ (Gwatkin); his own theology
was hazy and involved; as an Origenist, his main dread was of
Monarchianism, and his policy in the council was to stave off at least
such a condemnation of Arianism as should open the door to ‘confounding
the Persons.’ Eusebius apparently represents, therefore, the ‘left
wing,’ or the last mentioned, of the ‘conservative’ elements in the
council (*supra*, and Gwatkin, p. 38); but his learning, age, position,
and the ascendency of Origenist Theology in the East, marked him out as
the leader of the whole.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p8"></span>But the ‘conservatism’ of the great mass
of bishops rejected Arianism more promptly than had been expected by its
adherents or patrons.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p9"></span>The real work of the council did not begin
at once. The way was blocked by innumerable applications to the
Christian Emperor from bishops and clergy, mainly for the redress of
personal grievances. Commonplace men often fail to see the proportion of
things, and to rise to the magnitude of the events in which they play
their <span id="page_xix">p. xix</span> <span
id="v.ii.iii-Page_xix"></span>part. At last Constantine appointed a day
for the formal and final reception of all personal complaints, and burnt
the ‘libelli’ in the presence of the assembled fathers. He then named a
day by which the bishops were to be ready for a formal decision of the
matters in dispute. The way was now open for the leaders to set to work.
Quasi-formal meetings were held, Arius and his supporters met the
bishops, and the situation began to clear (Soz. i. 17). To their dismay
(*de Decr.* 3) the Arian leaders realised that they could only count on
some seventeen supporters out of the entire body of bishops. They would
seem to have seriously and honestly underrated the novelty of their own
teaching (cf. the letter of Arius in Thdt. i. 5), and to have come to
the council with the expectation of victory over the party of Alexander.
But they discovered their mistake:—

<span id="v.ii.iii-p10"></span>‘Sectamur ultro, quos opimus

<span id="v.ii.iii-p11"></span>Fallere et effugere est triumphus.”

<span id="v.ii.iii-p12"></span>‘Fallere et effugere’ was in fact the
problem which now confronted them. It seems to have been agreed at an
early stage, perhaps it was understood from the first, that some formula
of the unanimous belief of the Church must be fixed upon to make an end
of controversy. The Alexandrians and ‘Conservatives’ confronted the
Arians with the traditional Scriptural phrases (pp. 163, 491) which
appeared to leave no doubt as to the eternal Godhead of the Son. But to
their surprise they were met with perfect acquiescence. Only as each
test was propounded, it was observed that the suspected party whispered
and gesticulated to one another, evidently hinting that each could be
safely accepted, since it admitted of evasion. If their assent was asked
to the formula ‘like to the Father in all things,’ it was given with the
reservation that man as such is ‘the image and glory of God.’ The ‘power
of God’ elicited the whispered explanation that the host of Israel was
spoken of as <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p12.1"></span>δύναμις κυρίου</span>, and that even the
locust and caterpillar are called the ‘power of God.’ The ‘eternity’ of
the Son was countered by the text, ‘We that live are alway ([2 Cor. iv.
11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011)<span id="v.ii.iii-p12.2"></span>.md)!’
The fathers were baffled, and the test of <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p12.3"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p12.4"></span>μοούσιον</span>, with which the minority had
been ready from the first, was being forced (p. 172) upon the majority
by the evasions of the Arians. When the day for the decisive meeting
arrived it was felt that the choice lay between the adoption of the
word, cost what it might, and the admission of Arianism to a position of
toleration and influence in the Church. But then, was Arianism all that
Alexander and Eustathius made it out to be? was Arianism so very
intolerable, that this novel test must be imposed on the Church? The
answer came (Newman *Ar*. 4 p. 252) from Eusebius of Nicomedia. Upon the
assembling of the bishops for their momentous debate (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iii-p12.5"></span>ὡ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iii-p12.6"></span>ς</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iii-p12.7"></span>δὲ ἐζητεῖτο τῆς πίστεως ὁ
τρόπος</span>, *Eustath.*) he presented them with a statement of his
belief. The previous course of events may have convinced him that
half-measures would defeat their own purpose, and that a challenge to
the enemy, a forlorn hope, was the only resort left to him <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) . At any rate the statement was an
unambiguous assertion of the Arian formulæ, and it cleared the situation
at once. An angry clamour silenced the innovator, and his document was
publicly torn to shreds (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p13.4"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p13.5"></span>π᾽ ὄψει πάντων</span>, says an eye-witness in
Thdt. i. 8). Even the majority of the Arians were cowed, and the party
were reduced to the inner circle of five (*supra*). It was now agreed on
all hands that a stringent formula was needed. But Eusebius of Cæsarea
came forward with a last effort to stave off the inevitable. He produced
a formula, not of his own devising (Kölling, pp. 208 *sqq.*), but
consisting of the creed of his own Church with an addition intended to
guard against Sabellianism (Hort, *Two Diss.* pp. 56, *sq.* 138). The
formula was unassailable on the basis of Scripture and of tradition. No
one had a word to say against it, and the Emperor expressed his personal
anxiety that it should be adopted, with the single improvement of the
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iii-p13.6"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iii-p13.7"></span>μοούσιον</span>. The
suggestion thus quietly made was momentous in its result. We cannot but
recognise the ‘prompter’ Hosius behind the Imperial recommendation: the
friends of Alexander had patiently waited their time, and now their time
was come: the two Eusebii had placed the result in their hands. But how
and where was the necessary word to be inserted? and if some change must
be made in the Cæsarean formula, would it not be as well to set one or
two other details right? At any rate, the creed of Eusebius was
carefully overhauled clause by clause, and eventually took a form
materially different from that in which it was first presented <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) , and with affinities to the creeds of
Antioch and Jerusalem as well as Cæsarea.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p15"></span>All was now ready; the creed, the result
of minute and careful deliberations (we do not <span id="page_xx">p.
xx</span> <span id="v.ii.iii-Page_xx"></span>know their history, nor
even how long they occupied <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11) .md), lay
before the council. We are told ‘the council paused.’ The evidence fails
us; but it may well have been so. All the bishops who were genuinely
horrified at the naked Arianism of Eusebius of Nicomedia were yet far
from sharing the clearsighted definiteness of the few: they knew that
the test proposed was not in Scripture, that it had a suspicious history
in the Church. The history of the subsequent generation shews that the
mind of Eastern Christendom was not wholly ripe for its adoption. But
the fathers were reminded of the previous discussions, of the futility
of the Scriptural tests, of the locust and the caterpillar, of the
whisperings, the nods, winks, and evasions. With a great revulsion of
feeling the council closed its ranks and marched triumphantly to its
conclusion. All signed,—all but two, Secundus and Theonas. Maris signed
and Theognis, Menophantus and Patrophilus, and all the rest. Eusebius of
Nicomedia signed; signed everything, even the condemnation of his own
convictions and of his ‘genuine fellow-Lucianist’ Arius; not the last
time that an Arian leader was found to turn against a friend in the hour
of trial. Eusebius justified his signature by a ‘mental reservation;’
but we can sympathise with the bitter scorn of Secundus, who as he
departed to his exile warned Eusebius that he would not long escape the
same fate (Philost. i. 9).

<span id="v.ii.iii-p17"></span>The council broke up after being
entertained by the Emperor at a sumptuous banquet in honour of his
Vicennalia. The recalcitrant bishops with Arius and some others were
sent into exile (an unhappy and fateful precedent), a fate which soon
after overtook Eusebius of Nicomedia and Theognis (see the discussion in
D.C.B. ii. 364 *sq.*). But in 329 ‘we find Eusebius once more in high
favour with Constantine, discharging his episcopal functions, persuading
Constantine that he and Arius held substantially the Creed of Nicæa.’

<span id="v.ii.iii-p18"></span>The council also dealt with the Paschal
question (see *Vit. Const.* iii. 18; so far as the question bears on
Athanasius see below, p. 500), and with the Meletian schism in Egypt.
The latter was the main subject of a letter (Soc. i. 9; Thdt. i. 9) to
the Alexandrian Church. Meletius himself was to retain the honorary
title of bishop, to remain strictly at home, and to be in lay communion
for the rest of his life. The bishops and clergy of his party were to
receive a <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p18.1"></span>μυστικωτέρα χειροτονία</span> (see Bright,
*Notes on Canons,* pp. 25 *sqq.*; Gore, *The Church and the Ministry,*
ed. 1, p. 192 note), and to be allowed to discharge their office, but in
the strictest subordination to the Catholic Clergy of Alexander. But on
vacancies occurring, the Meletian incumbents were to succeed subject to
(1) their fitness, (2) the wishes of the people, (3) the approval of the
Bishop of Alexandria. The terms were mild, and even the gentle nature of
Alexander seems to have feared that immediate peace might have been
purchased at the expense of future trouble (his successor openly blames
the compromise, p. 131, and more strongly p. 137); accordingly, before
carrying out the settlement he required Meletius to draw up an exact
list of his clergy at the time of the council, so as to bar an
indefinite multiplication of claims. Meletius, who must have been even
less pleased with the settlement than his metropolitan, seems to have
taken his time. At last nothing would satisfy both parties but the
personal presentation of the Meletian bishops from all Egypt, and of
their clergy <span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span> <span
id="v.ii.iii-Page_xxi"></span>from Alexandria itself, to Alexander (p.
137, <span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iii-p18.2"></span>τούτους καὶ
παρόντας παρέδωκεν τῷ ᾽Αλεξάνδρῳ</span>), who was thus enabled to check
the *Brevium* or schedule handed in by their chief <span
id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) . All this must have taken a long time
after Alexander’s return, and the peace was soon broken by his death.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p20"></span>Five months after the conclusion of the
negotiations, Alexander having now died, the flame of schism broke out
afresh (*infr.* p. 131. Montfaucon, in Migne xxv. p. lvii., shews
conclusively that the above is the meaning of the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iii-p20.1"></span>μῆνας πέντε</span>.) On
his death-bed, Alexander called for Athanasius. He was away from
Alexandria, but the other deacon of that name (see signatures p. 71),
stepped forward in answer to the call. But without noticing him, the
Bishop repeated the name, adding, ‘You think to escape, but it cannot
be.’ (Sozom. ii. 17.) Alexander had already written his Easter Letter
for the year 328 (it was apparently still extant at the end of the
century, p. 503). He died on April 17 of that year (Pharmuthi 22), and
on the eighth of June Athanasius was chosen bishop in his stead.

this connection by Mr. Gwatkin (p. 38, note), and since adopted by many

importations of political terms into the grave questions of this period,
the term is too useful to be surrendered, and the ‘conservatives’ of the
Post-Nicene reaction were in fact too often political in their methods
and spirit. The *truly* conservative men, here as in other instances,
failed to enlist the sympathy of the conservative rank and file.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[xx:12](2040015.htm#fr_11.md) <span
id="v.ii.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.iii-p16"></span> The events have been related in what
seems to be their most likely order, but there is no real certainty in
the matter. It is clear that there were at least two public sittings
(Soz. i. 17, the language of Eus. *V. C.* iii. 10, is reconcileable with
this) in the emperor’s presence, at the first of which the *libelli*
were burned and the bishops requested to examine the question of faith.
This was probably on June 19. The tearing up of the creed of Eus. Nic.
seems from the account of Eustathius to have come immediately before the
final adoption of a creed. The creed of Eusebius of Cæsarea, which was
the basis of that finally adopted, must therefore have been propounded
after the failure of his namesake. (Montfaucon and others are clearly
wrong in supposing that *this* was the ‘blasphemy’ which was torn to
pieces!) The difficulty is, where to put the dramatic scene of
whisperings, nods, winks, and evasions which compelled the bishops to
apply a drastic test. I think (with Kölling, &c.) that it must have
preceded the proposal of Eusebius, upon which the <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iii-p16.2"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iii-p16.3"></span>μοούσιον</span> was
quietly insisted on by Constantine; for the latter was the only occasion
(<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iii-p16.5"></span>πρόφασις</span>)
of any modification in the Cæsarean Creed, which in itself does not
correspond to the tests described *infr.* p. 163. But Montfaucon and
others, followed by Gwatkin, place the scene in question *after* the
proposal of Eus. Cæs. and the resolution to modify his creed by the
insertion of a stringent test,—in fact at the ‘pause’ of the council
before its final resolution. This conflicts with the clear statement of
Eusebius that the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p16.7"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p16.8"></span>μοούσιον</span> was the ‘thin end of the
wedge’ which led to the entire recasting of his creed (see *infr.* p.
73. The idea of Kölling, p. 208, that the creed of Eusebius was drawn up
by him for the occasion, and that the <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p16.10"></span>μάθημα</span> of the council was ready
beforehand as an alternative document, is refuted by the relation of the
two documents; see Hort, pp. 138, 139). It follows, therefore, from the
combined accounts of Ath., Euseb. and Eustathius (our only
eye-witnesses) that (1) the fathers were practically resolved upon the
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iii-p16.12"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.iii-p16.13"></span>μοούσιον</span> before
the final sitting. (2) That this resolve was clinched by the creed of
Eusebius of Nicomedia. (3) That Eusebius of Cæsarea made his proposal
when it was too late to think of half-measures. (4) That the creed of
Eusebius was modified at the Emperor’s direction (which presupposes the
willingness of the Council). (5) That this revision was immediately
followed by the signatures and the close of the council. The work of
revision, however, shews such signs of attention to detail that we are
almost compelled to assume at least one adjournment of the final
sitting. When the other business of the council was transacted,
including the settlement of the Easter question, the Meletian schism,
and the Canons, it is impossible to say. Kölling *suo jure* puts them at
the first public session. The question must be left open, as must that
of the presidency of the council. The conduct of the proceedings was
evidently in the hands of Constantine, so that the question of
presidency reduces itself to that of identifying the bishop on
Constantine’s right who delivered the opening address to the Emperor:
this was certainly not Hosius (see *Vit. C*. iii. 11, and vol. 1 of this
series, p. 19), but may have been Eusebius of Cæsarea, who probably
after a few words from Eustathius (Thdt.) or Alexander (Theod. Mops. and
Philost.) was entrusted with so congenial a task. The name of Hosius
stands first on the extant list of signatures, and he may have signed
first, although the lists are bad witnesses. The words of Athanasius
sometimes quoted in this connection (p. 256), ‘over what synod did he
not preside?’ must be read in connection with the distinction made by
Theodoret in quoting the passage in question (*H. E.* ii. 15) that
Hosius ’was *very prominent* at the great synod of Nicæa, and *presided*
over those who assembled at Sardica. This is the only evidence we
possess to which any weight can be attached.
