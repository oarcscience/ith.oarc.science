<span id="xxv.i-p3"></span> ————————————

<span id="xxv.i-p4"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.i-p4.1"></span>The</span> Letters cannot be arranged in strict
sequence of time without breaking into the homogeneity of the *corpus*
of Easter Letters. Accordingly we divide them into two parts: (1) all
that remain of the Easter or Festal Epistles: (2) Personal Letters. From
the latter class we exclude synodical or encyclical documents, or
treatises merely inscribed to a friend, such as those printed above pp.
91, 149, 173, 222, &c., &c., the *ad Serapionem, ad Marcellinum,* &c.
There remain a number of highly interesting letters, the survivals of
what must have been a large correspondence, all of which, excepting six
(Nos. 52, 54, 56, 59, 60, 61), now appear in English for the first time.
They are arranged as nearly as possible in strict chronological order,
though this is in some cases open to doubt (e.g. 60, 64, &c.). They
mostly belong to the later half of the episcopate of Athanasius, and are
therefore placed after the Festal Collection, which however itself
extends to the end of the Bishop’s life. The immemorial numbering of the
latter collection is of course retained, although many of the forty-five
are no longer to be found.

<span id="xxv.i-p5"></span>Prefixed to the Letters are two almost
contemporary chronicles, the one preserved in the same <span
class="c10"><span id="xxv.i-p5.1"></span>ms.</span> as Letters 46, 47,
the other prefixed to the Syriac <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.i-p5.2"></span>ms.</span>, which is our sole channel for the
bulk of the Easter Letters. A memorandum appended to Letter 64 specifies
certain fragments not included in this volume. The striking fragment
*Filiis suis* has been conjecturally placed among the remains of
*Letter* 29.

<span id="xxv.i-p6"></span>For the arrangement of the Letters, the
reader is referred to the general Table of Contents to this volume. We
now give

<span id="xxv.i-p7"></span>a. The *Historia Acephala* or Maffeian
fragment, with short introduction.

<span id="xxv.i-p8"></span>b. The Chronicon Prævium or *Festal Index*,
with introduction to it and to the Festal Letters.
