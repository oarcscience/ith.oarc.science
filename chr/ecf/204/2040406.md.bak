<span id="xxv.ii.i-p1"></span> <span class="c8"><span
id="xxv.ii.i-p1.1"></span>A.—The *Historia Acephala.*</span>

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p3"></span>This most important document was brought
to light in 1738 by the Marchese F. Scipio Maffei († 1755), from a Latin
<span class="c10"><span id="xxv.ii.i-p3.1"></span>ms.</span> (uncial
parchment) in the Chapter Library at Verona. It was reprinted from
Maffei’s *Osservazioni Letterarie* in the Padua edition of Athanasius;
also in 1769 by Gallandi (*Bibl. Patr.* v. 222), from which edition (the
reprint in Migne, xxvi. 1443 *sqq*. being full of serious misprints) the
following version has been made. The Latin text (including letters 46,
47, and a Letter of the Council of Sardica) is very imperfect, but the
annalist is so careful in his reckonings, and so often repeats himself,
that the careful reader can nearly always use the document to make good
its own gaps or wrong readings. Beyond this (except the insertion of the
consuls for 372, §17 *ad fin.*) the present editor has not
ventured <span id="fr_3766"></span>[3767](#fn_3766.md) to go. The
importance and value of the fragment must now be shewn.

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p5"></span>The annalist evidently writes under the
episcopate of Theophilus, to which he hurriedly brings down his
chronology after the death of Athanasius (§19). At the fortieth
anniversary of the episcopate of Athanasius, June 8, 368, he makes a
pause (§17) in order to reckon up his dates. This passage is the key of
the whole of his chronological data. He accounts for the period of forty
years (thus placing the accession of Ath. at June 8, 328, in agreement
with the Index), shewing how it is exactly made up by the periods of
‘exile’ and of ‘quiet’ previously mentioned. To ‘quiet’ he assigns ‘xxii
years v months and x days,’ to ‘exile’ xvii years vi months xx days;
total xl years. He then shews how the latter is made up by the several
exiles he has chronicled. As the text stands we have the following sum:

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p6"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.ii.i-p6.1"></span>Table A.</span>

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p7"></span><span class="c10"><span

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p10"></span>iii days

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p18"></span>(5)

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p19"></span>iv "

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p20"></span>‘exact result’

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p21"></span>xvii years

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p22"></span>vi months

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p23"></span>xx days

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p24"></span>Now the exact result of the figures as
they stand is 182 months, 9 days, *i.e.* 15 years 2 months and 9 days,
or 2 years 4 months and 11 days too little. Moreover of the well-known
‘five exiles,’ only four are accounted for. An exile has thus dropped
out, and an item of 2 years 4 months 11 days. Now this corresponds
exactly with the interval from Epiphi 17 (July 11), 335 (departure for
Tyre, *Fest. Ind.* viii), to Athyr 27 (Nov. 23), 337 <span
id="page_496">p. 496</span> <span id="xxv.ii.i-Page_496"></span> (return
to Alexandria *F. I.* x). The annalist then (followed apparently by
Theodt*. H. E.* ii. 1) reckoned the *first* exile at the above figure.
But what of the first figure in our table, xc months iii days? It again
exactly coincides with the interval from Pharm. 21 (Apr. 16, Easter
Monday), 339 to Paophi 24 (Oct. 21), 346, on which day (§1) Athan.
returned from his *second* exile. This double coincidence cannot be an
accident. It demonstrates beyond all dispute that the missing item of
‘ann. ii, mens. iv, d. xii’ has dropped out after ‘Treveris in Galliis,’
and that ‘mens. xc, dies iii’ *relates to the second exile,* so that, in
§1 also, the annalist wrote not ‘annos vi’ but ‘annos *vii menses* vi
*dies iii,*’ which he repeats §17 by its equivalent ‘mens. xc, d. iii,’
while words have dropped out in §1 to the effect of what is supplied in
brackets. (Hefele, ii. 50, Eng. Tr., is therefore in error here).

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p25"></span>I would add that the same obvious
principle of correcting a clearly corrupt figure by the writer’s own
subsequent reference to it, enables us also to correct the last figures
of §2 by those of §5, to correct the items by the sum total of §§6, 7,
and lastly to correct the corrupt readings ‘Gregorius’ for Georgius, and
‘Constans’ for Constantius, by the many uncorrupt places which shew that
the annalist himself was perfectly aware of the right names.

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p26"></span>In one passage alone (§13 ‘Athyr’ twice
for Mechir, cf. *Fest. Ind.* viii) is conjecture really needed; but even
here the consuls are correctly given, and support the right date.

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p27"></span>We are now in a position to construct
tables of ‘exiles’ and ‘quiet’ periods from the *Historia* as corrected
by itself.

dates or figures *directly implied* in the existing text, (b) those
implied by it *in combination* with other sources, (c) those based on
*conjectural* emendation of the existing text. All unmarked data are
expressly given.

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p101"></span>Table B shews the deliberate and careful
calculation which runs through the system of our annalist. Once or twice
he indulges in a round figure, exiles 1 and 5 are each a day too long by
the Egyptian calendar, and this is set off by his apparently reckoning
the fifth quiet period as two days too short. But the writer clearly
knew his own mind. In fact, the one just ground on which we might
distrust his chronology is its systematic character. He has a thorough
scheme of his own, which he carries out to a nicety. Now such a
chronology is not necessarily untrustworthy. Its consistency *may* be
artificial; on the other hand, it may be due to accurate knowledge of
the facts. Whether this is so or not must be ascertained partly from a
writer’s known opportunities and capacity, partly from his agreement or
discrepancy with other sources of knowledge. Now our annalist wrote in
the time of Theophilus (385–412), and may therefore rank as a
contemporary of Athanasius (cf. Prolegg. ch. v.) His opportunities
therefore were excellent. As to his capacity, his work bears every trace
of care and skill. He is no historian, nor a stylist, but as an annalist
he understood what he was doing. As to agreement with other data, we
remark to begin with that it was the publication of this fragment in the
18th century that first shed a ray of light on the Erebus and Chaos of
the chronology of the Council of Sardica and its adjacent events; that
it at once justified the critical genius of Montfaucon, Tillemont and
others, against the objections with which their date for the death of
Athanasius <span id="fr_3767"></span>[3768](#fn_3767.md) was assailed, and
here again upset the confused chronological statements of the
fifth-century historians in favour of the incidental evidence of many
more primary authorities <span id="fr_3768"></span>[3769](#fn_3768.md) .
But most important of all is its confirmation by the evidence of the
*Festal Letters* discovered in 1842, and especially by their *Index,*
the so-called ‘Chronicon Athanasianum.’ It is evident at a glance that
our annalist is quite independent of the *Index,* as he gives many
details which it does not contain. But neither can the *Index* be a
compilation from the annalist. Each writer had access to information not
embodied in the other, and there is no positive evidence that either
used the other in any way. When they agree, therefore, their evidence
has the greatest possible weight. Their main heads of agreement are
indicated in the Chronological Table, Prolegg. *sub fin.*

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p104"></span>It remains to notice shortly the two
digressions on the doings of Eudoxius and the Anomœans (§§2, 12 of
Migne, paragraphs II, IX of Gallandi). Here the annalist is off his own
ground, and evidently less well informed. In §2 we learn nothing of
interest: but the ‘Ecthesis’ of the Anomœans in par. IX is of
importance, and only too evidently authentic. It still awaits a critical
examination, and it is not easy to give it its exact place in the
history of the later Arianism. Apparently it belongs to the period
360–364, when the Anomœans were organising their schism (Gwatkin, pp.
226, 180) the names being those of the ultra-Arians condemned by the
Homœans in 360 (Prolegg. ch. ii. §8 *fin.*).

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p105"></span>The contrast between the vagueness of
statement in these digressions, and the writer’s firmness of touch in
dealing with Alexandrian affairs is most significant.

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p106"></span>The fragment runs as follows:

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p4"></span> The corrections were made before he could
obtain the essay and text of Sievers (*Zeitsch. Hist. Theol.* 1868),
where he now finds them nearly all anticipated. Sievers’ discussion has
been carefully and gratefully used, but his text is defective,
especially from the accidental omission of one of the key-clauses of the
whole (§17).

<span id="xxv.ii.i-p102"></span> But our annalist gives May 3, while
*Fest. Ind.* gives May 2, the day solemnised in the Coptic Martyrologies
(Mai, *Script. Vett.* vol. 4, part 2, pp. 29, 114), and doubtless the
right one. Perhaps, if Athanasius died in the night of May 2–3, the
former day might be chosen for his commemoration, while our annalist may
still be literally exact.
