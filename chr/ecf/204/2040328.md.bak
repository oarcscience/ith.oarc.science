<span id="xix.ii.xxv-p1"></span> 25. *Athanasius’s wonderful escape.*

<span id="xix.ii.xxv-p2"></span>Now when Providence had delivered us in
such an extraordinary manner, who can justly lay any blame upon me,
because we did not give ourselves up into the hands of them that sought
after us, nor return and present ourselves before them? This would have
been plainly to shew ingratitude to the Lord, and to act against His
commandment, and in contradiction to the practice of the Saints. He who
censures me in this matter must presume also to blame the great Apostle
Peter, because though he was shut up and guarded by soldiers, he
followed the angel that summoned him, and when he had gone forth from
the prison and escaped in safety, he did not return and surrender
himself, although he heard what Herod had done. Let the Arian in his
madness censure the Apostle Paul, because when he was let down from the
wall and had escaped in safety, he did not change his mind, and return
and give himself up; or Moses, because he returned not out of Midian
into Egypt, that he might be taken of them that sought after him; or
David, because when he was concealed in the cave, he did not discover
himself to Saul. As also the sons of the prophets remained in their
caves, and did not surrender themselves to Ahab. This would have been to
act contrary to the commandment, since the Scripture says, ‘Thou shalt
not tempt the Lord thy God <span id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md) .’
