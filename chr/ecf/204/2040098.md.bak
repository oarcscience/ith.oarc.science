id="vii.ii.i-p1.1"></span>On the Incarnation of the Word.</span>

<span id="vii.ii.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="vii.ii.i-p3"></span>§1. *Introductory.—The subject of this
treatise: the humiliation and incarnation of the Word. Presupposes the
doctrine of Creation, and that by the Word. The Father has saved the
world by Him through Whom he first made it*.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p4"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="vii.ii.i-p4.1"></span>Whereas</span> in what precedes we have drawn
out—choosing a few points from among many—a sufficient account of the
error of the heathen concerning idols, and of the worship of idols, and
how they originally came to be invented; how, namely, out of wickedness
men devised for themselves the worshipping of idols: and whereas we have
by God’s grace noted somewhat also of the divinity of the Word of the
Father, and of His universal Providence and power, and that the Good
Father through Him orders all things, and all things are moved by Him,
and in Him are quickened: come now, Macarius <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191) (worthy of that name.md), and true lover
of Christ, let us follow up the faith of our religion <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) , and set forth also what relates to
the Word’s becoming Man, and to His divine Appearing amongst us, which
Jews traduce and Greeks laugh to scorn, but we worship; in order that,
all the more for the seeming low estate of the Word, your piety toward
Him may be increased and multiplied. 2. For the more He is mocked among
the unbelieving, the more witness does He give of His own Godhead;
inasmuch as He not only Himself demonstrates as possible what men
mistake, thinking impossible, but what men deride as unseemly, this by
His own goodness He clothes with seemliness, and what men, in their
conceit of wisdom, laugh at as merely human, He by His own power
demonstrates to be divine, subduing the pretensions of idols by His
supposed humiliation—by the Cross—and those who mock and disbelieve
invisibly winning over to recognise His divinity and power. 3. But to
treat this subject it is necessary to recall what has been previously
said; in order that you may neither fail to know the cause of the bodily
appearing of the Word of the Father, so high and so great, nor think it
a consequence of His own nature that the Saviour has worn a body; but
that being incorporeal by nature, and Word from the beginning, He has
yet of the loving-kindness and goodness of His own Father been
manifested to us in a human body for our salvation. 4. It is, then,
proper for us to begin the treatment of this subject by speaking of the
creation of the universe, and of God its Artificer, that so it may be
duly perceived that the renewal of creation has been the work of the
self-same Word that made it at the beginning. For it will appear not
inconsonant for the Father to have wrought its salvation in Him by Whose
means He made it.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p5"></span> See *Contra Gentes,* i. The word (Μ<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.ii.i-p5.2"></span>ακάριε</span>) may be an
adjective only, but its occurrence in *both* places seems decisive. The
name was very common (*Apol. c. Ar.* passim). ‘Macarius’ was a
Christian, as the present passage shews: he is presumed (*c. Gent.* i.
7) to have access to Scripture.

[Next: Erroneous views of Creation rejected. (1) Epicurean (fortuitous
generation). But diversity of bodies and parts argues a creating
intellect. (2.) Platonists (pre-existent matter.) But this subjects God
to human limitations, making Him not a creator but a mechanic. (3)
Gnostics (an alien Demiurge). Rejected from Scripture.](2040099.md)
