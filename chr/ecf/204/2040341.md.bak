<span id="xx.ii.viii"></span>

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c8"><span
id="xx.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>Part VIII.</span>

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xx.ii.viii-p2.1"></span>Persecution in Egypt</span>.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p3"></span>64. Who would call them even by the name
of Gentiles; much less by that of Christians? Would any one regard their
habits and feelings as human, and not rather those of wild beasts,
seeing their cruel and savage conduct? They are more worthless than
public hangmen; more audacious than all other heretics. To the Gentiles
they are much inferior, and stand far apart and separate from them <span
id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721.md) . I have heard from our fathers,
and I believe their report to be a faithful one, that long ago, when
<span id="page_294">p. 294</span> <span
id="xx.ii.viii-Page_294"></span>a persecution arose in the time <span
id="fr_1722"></span>[1723](#fn_1722.md) of Maximian, the grandfather of
Constantius, the Gentiles concealed our brethren the Christians, who
were sought after, and frequently suffered the loss of their own
substance, and had trial of imprisonment, solely that they might not
betray the fugitives. They protected those who fled to them for refuge,
as they would have done their own persons, and were determined to run
all risks on their behalf. But now these admirable persons, the
inventors of a new heresy, act altogether the contrary part; and are
distinguished for nothing but their treachery. They have appointed
themselves as executioners, and seek to betray all alike, and make those
who conceal others the objects of their plots, esteeming equally as
their enemy both him that conceals and him that is concealed. So
murderous are they; so emulous in their evil-doings of the wickedness of
Judas.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p6"></span>65. *Martyrdom of Secundus of Barka.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p7"></span>The crimes these men have committed
cannot adequately be described. I would only say, that as I write and
wish to enumerate all their deeds of iniquity, the thought enters my
mind, whether this heresy be not the fourth daughter of the
horse-leach <span id="fr_1723"></span>[1724](#fn_1723.md) in the Proverbs,
since after so many acts of injustice, so many murders, it hath not yet
said, ‘It is enough.’ No; it still rages, and goes about <span
id="fr_1724"></span>[1725](#fn_1724.md) seeking after those whom it has not
yet discovered, while those whom it has already injured, it is eager to
injure anew. After the night attack, after the evils committed in
consequence of it, after the persecution brought about by Heraclius,
they cease not yet to accuse us falsely before the Emperor (and they are
confident that as impious persons they will obtain a hearing), desiring
that something more than banishment may be inflicted upon us, and that
hereafter those who do not consent to their impieties may be destroyed.
Accordingly, being now emboldened in an extreme degree, that most
abandoned Secundus <span id="fr_1725"></span>[1726](#fn_1725.md) of
Pentapolis, and Stephanus <span id="fr_1726"></span>[1727](#fn_1726.md) his
accomplice, conscious that their heresy was a defence of any injustice
they might commit, on discovering a Presbyter at Barka who would not
comply with their desires (he was called Secundus, being of the same
name, but not of the same faith with the heretic), they kicked him till
he died <span id="fr_1727"></span>[1728](#fn_1727.md) . While he was thus
suffering he imitated the Saint, and said, ‘Let no one avenge my cause
before human judges; I have the Lord for my avenger, for whose sake I
suffer these things at their hands.’ They however were not moved with
pity at these words, nor did they feel any awe of the sacred season; for
it was during the time of Lent <span
id="fr_1728"></span>[1729](#fn_1728.md) that they thus kicked the man to
death.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p14"></span>66. *Persecution the weapon of
Arianism.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p15"></span>O new heresy, that hast put on the
whole devil in impiety and wicked deeds! For in truth it is but a lately
invented evil; and although certain heretofore appear to have adopted
its doctrines, yet they concealed them, and were not known to hold them.
But Eusebius and Arius, like serpents coming out of their holes, have
vomited forth the poison of this impiety; Arius daring to blasphemy
openly, and <span id="fr_1729"></span>[1730](#fn_1729.md) Eusebius
defending his blasphemy. He was not however able to support the heresy,
until, as I said before, he found a patron <span
id="fr_1730"></span>[1731](#fn_1730.md) for it in the Emperor. Our fathers
called an Ecumenical Council, when three hundred of them, more or
less <span id="fr_1731"></span>[1732](#fn_1731.md) , met together and
condemned the Arian heresy, and all declared that it was alien and
strange to the faith of the Church. Upon this its supporters, perceiving
that they were dishonoured, and had now no good ground of argument to
insist upon, devised a different method, and attempted to vindicate it
by means of external power. And herein one may especially admire the
novelty as well as wickedness of their device, and how they go beyond
all other heresies. For these support their madness by persuasive
arguments calculated to deceive the simple; the Greeks, as the Apostle
has said, make their attack with excellency and persuasiveness of
speech, and with plausible fallacies; the Jews, leaving the divine
Scriptures, now, as the Apostle again has said, contend about ‘fables
and endless genealogies <span id="fr_1732"></span>[1733](#fn_1732.md) ;’
and the Manichees and Valentinians with them, and others, corrupting the
divine Scriptures, put forth fables in terms of their own inventions.
But the Arians are bolder than them all, and have shewn that the other
heresies are but their younger sisters <span
id="fr_1733"></span>[1734](#fn_1733.md) , whom, as I have said, they
surpass in impiety, emulating them all, and especially the Jews in their
iniquity. For as the Jews, when they were unable to prove the charges
which they pretended to allege against Paul, straightway led him to the
chief captain and the governor; so likewise these men, who surpass the
Jews in their devices, make use only of the power of the judges; and if
any one so much as speaks against them, he is dragged before the
Governor or the General.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p21"></span><span id="page_295">p. 295</span> <span
id="xx.ii.viii-Page_295"></span>67. *Arianism worse than other heresies,
because of Persecution.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p22"></span>The other heresies also, when the very
Truth has refuted them on the clearest evidence, are wont to be silent,
being simply confounded by their conviction. But this modern and
accursed heresy, when it is overthrown by argument, when it is cast down
and covered with shame by the very Truth, forthwith endeavours to coerce
by violence and stripes and imprisonment those whom it has been unable
to persuade by argument, thereby acknowledging itself to be anything
rather than godly. For it is the part of true godliness not to
compel <span id="fr_1734"></span>[1735](#fn_1734.md) , but to persuade, as
I said before. Thus our Lord Himself, not as employing force, but as
offering to their free choice, has said to all, ‘If any man will follow
after Me <span id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735.md) ;’ and to His
disciples, ‘Will ye also go away <span
id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736.md) ?’ This heresy, however, is
altogether alien from godliness; and therefore how otherwise should it
act, than contrary to our Saviour, seeing also that it has enlisted that
enemy of Christ, Constantius, as it were Antichrist himself <span
id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737.md) , to be its leader in impiety? He
for its sake has earnestly endeavoured to emulate Saul in savage
cruelty. For when the priests gave victuals to David, Saul commanded,
and they were all destroyed, in number three hundred and five <span
id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738.md) ; and this man, now that all avoid
the heresy, and confess a sound faith in the Lord, annuls a Council of
full three hundred Bishops, banishes the Bishops themselves, and hinders
the people from the practice of piety, and from their prayers to God,
preventing their public assemblies. And as Saul overthrew Nob, the city
of the priests, so this man, advancing even further in wickedness, has
given up the Churches to the impious. And as he honoured Doeg the
accuser before the true priests, and persecuted David, giving ear to the
Ziphites; so this man prefers heretics to the godly, and still
persecutes them that flee from him, giving ear to his own eunuchs, who
falsely accuse the orthodox. He does not perceive that whatever he does
or writes in behalf of the heresy of the Arians, involves an
attack <span id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739.md) upon the Saviour.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p29"></span>68. *Constantius worse than Saul, Ahab,
and Pilate. His past conduct to his own relations.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p30"></span>Ahab himself did not act so cruelly
towards the priests of God, as this man has acted towards the Bishops.
For he was at least pricked in his conscience, when Naboth had been
murdered, and was afraid at the sight <span
id="fr_1740"></span>[1741](#fn_1740.md) of Elijah, but this man neither
reverenced the great Hosius, nor was wearied or pricked in conscience,
after banishing so many Bishops; but like another Pharaoh, the more he
is afflicted, the more he is hardened, and imagines greater wickedness
day by day. And the most extraordinary instance of his iniquity was the
following. It happened that when the Bishops were condemned to
banishment, certain other persons also received their sentence on
charges of murder or sedition or theft, each according to the quality of
his offence. These men after a few months he released, on being
requested to do so, as Pilate did Barabbas; but the servants of Christ
he not only refused to set at liberty, but even sentenced them to more
unmerciful punishment in the place of their exile, proving himself ‘an
undying evil <span id="fr_1741"></span>[1742](#fn_1741.md) ’ to them. To
the others through congeniality of disposition he became a friend; but
to the orthodox he was an enemy on account of their true faith in
Christ. Is it not clear to all men from hence, that the Jews of old when
they demanded Barabbas, and crucified the Lord, acted but the part which
these present enemies of Christ are acting together with Constantius?
nay, that he is even more bitter than Pilate. For Pilate, when he
perceived <span id="fr_1742"></span>[1743](#fn_1742.md) the injustice of
the deed, washed his hands; but this man, while he banishes the saints,
gnashes his teeth against them more and more.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p34"></span>69. But what wonder is it if, after he
has been led into impious errors, he is so cruel towards the Bishops,
since the common feelings of humanity could not induce him to spare
<span id="page_296">p. 296</span> <span
id="xx.ii.viii-Page_296"></span>even his own kindred. His uncles <span
id="fr_1743"></span>[1744](#fn_1743.md) he slew; his cousins he put out of
the way; he commiserated not the sufferings of his father-in-law, though
he had married his daughter, or of his kinsmen; but he has ever been a
transgressor of his oaths towards all. So likewise he treated his
brother in an unholy manner; and now he pretends to build his sepulchre,
although he delivered up to the barbarians his betrothed wife Olympias,
whom his brother had protected till his death, and had brought up as his
intended consort. Moreover he attempted to set aside his wishes,
although he boasts to be his heir <span
id="fr_1744"></span>[1745](#fn_1744.md) ; for so he writes, in terms which
any one possessed of but a small measure of sense would be ashamed of.
But when I compare his letters, I find that he does not possess common
understanding, but that his mind is solely regulated by the suggestions
of others, and that he has no mind of his own at all. Now Solomon says,
‘If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked <span
id="fr_1745"></span>[1746](#fn_1745.md) .’ This man proves by his actions
that he is such an unjust one, and that those about him are wicked.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p38"></span>70. *Inconstancy of Constantius.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p39"></span>How then, being such an one, and taking
pleasure in such associates, can he ever design anything just or
reasonable, entangled as he is in the iniquity of his followers, men who
verily bewitch him, or rather who have trampled his brains under their
heels? Wherefore he now writes letters <span
id="fr_1746"></span>[1747](#fn_1746.md) , and then repents that he has
written them, and after repenting is again stirred up to anger, and then
again laments his fate, and being undetermined what to do, he shews a
soul destitute of understanding. Being then of such a character, one
must fairly pity him, because that under the semblance and name of
freedom he is the slave of those who drag him on to gratify their own
impious pleasure. In a word, while through his folly and inconstancy, as
the Scripture saith <span id="fr_1747"></span>[1748](#fn_1747.md) , he is
willing to comply with the desires of others, he has given himself up to
condemnation, to be consumed by fire in the future judgment; at once
consenting to do whatever they wish, and gratifying them in their
designs against the Bishops, and in their exertion of authority over the
Churches. For behold, he has now again thrown into disorder all the
Churches of Alexandria <span id="fr_1748"></span>[1749](#fn_1748.md) and of
Egypt and Libya, and has publicly given orders, that the Bishops of the
Catholic Church and faith be cast out of their churches, and that they
be all given up to the professors of the Arian doctrines <span
id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749.md) . The General began to carry this
order into execution; and straightway Bishops were sent off in chains,
and Presbyters and Monks bound with iron, after being almost beaten to
death with stripes. Disorder prevails in every place; all Egypt and
Libya are in danger, the people being indignant at this unjust command,
and seeing in it the preparation for the coming of Antichrist, and
beholding their property plundered by others, and given up into the
hands of the heretics.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p44"></span>71. *This wickedness unprecedented.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p45"></span>When was ever such iniquity heard of?
when was such an evil deed ever perpetrated, even in times of
persecution? They were heathens who persecuted formerly; but they did
not bring their idols into the Churches. Zenobia <span
id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750.md) , was a Jewess, and a supporter of
Paul of Samosata; but she did not give up the Churches to the Jews for
Synagogues. This is a new piece of iniquity. It is not simply
persecution, but more than persecution, it is a prelude and
preparation <span id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751.md) for the coming of
Antichrist. Even if it be admitted that they invented false charges
against Athanasius and the rest of the Bishops whom they banished, yet
what is this to their later practices? What charges have they to allege
against the whole of Egypt and Libya and Pentapolis <span
id="fr_1752"></span>[1753](#fn_1752.md) ? For they have begun no longer to
lay their plots against individuals, in which case they might be able to
frame a lie against them; but they have set upon all in a body, so that
if they merely choose to invent accusations against them, they must be
condemned. Thus their wickedness has blinded their understanding <span
id="fr_1753"></span>[1754](#fn_1753.md) ; and they have required, without
any reason assigned, that the whole body of the Bishops shall be
expelled, and thereby they shew that the charges they framed against
Athanasius and the rest of the Bishops whom they banished were false,
and invented for no other purpose than to support the accursed heresy of
the Arian enemies of Christ. This is now no longer concealed, but has
become most manifest to all men. He commanded Athanasius to be expelled
out of the city, and gave up the Churches to them. And the Presbyters
and Deacons that were with him, who had been appointed by Peter and
Alexander, were also expelled and driven into banishment; and the real
Arians, who not through any suspicions arising from circumstances, but
on account of the heresy had been expelled at first together with Arius
himself by <span id="page_297">p. 297</span> <span
id="xx.ii.viii-Page_297"></span>the Bishop Alexander,—Secundus in Libya,
in Alexandria Euzoius <span id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754.md) the
Chananæan, Julius, Ammon, Marcus, Irenæus, Zosimus, and Sarapion
surnamed Pelycon, and in Libya Sisinnius, and the younger men with him,
associates in his impiety; these have obtained possession of the
Churches.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p51"></span>72. *Banishment of Egyptian Bishops.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p52"></span>And the General Sebastian wrote to the
governors and military authorities in every place; and the true Bishops
were persecuted, and those who professed impious doctrines were brought
in in their stead. They banished Bishops who had grown old in orders,
and had been many years in the Episcopate, having been ordained by the
Bishop Alexander; Ammonius <span id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755.md) ,
Hermes, Anagamphus, and Marcus, they sent to the Upper Oasis; Muis,
Psenosiris, Nilammon, Plenes, Marcus, and Athenodorus to Ammoniaca, with
no other intention than that they should perish in their passage through
the deserts. They had no pity on them though they were suffering from
illness, and indeed proceeded on their journey with so much difficulty
on account of their weakness, that they were obliged to be carried in
litters, and their sickness was so dangerous that the materials for
their burial accompanied them. One of them indeed died, but they would
not even permit the body to be given up to his friends for interment.
With the same purpose they banished also the Bishop Dracontius to the
desert places about Clysma, Philo to Babylon, Adelphius to Psinabla in
the Thebais, and the Presbyters Hierax and Dioscorus to Syene. They
likewise drove into exile Ammonius, Agathus, Agathodæmon, Apollonius,
Eulogius, Apollos, Paphnutius, Gaius, and Flavius, ancient Bishops, as
also the Bishops Dioscorus, Ammonius, Heraclides, and Psais; some of
whom they gave up to work in the stone-quarries, others they persecuted
with an intention to destroy, and many others they plundered. They
banished also forty of the laity, with certain virgins whom they had
before exposed to the fire <span id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756.md) ;
beating them so severely with rods taken from palm-trees, that after
lingering five days some of them died, and others had recourse to
surgical treatment on account of the thorns left in their limbs, from
which they suffered torments worse than death <span
id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757.md) . But what is most dreadful to the
mind of any man of sound understanding, though characteristic of these
miscreants, is this: When the virgins during the scourging called upon
the Name of Christ, they gnashed their teeth against them with increased
fury. Nay more, they would not give up the bodies of the dead to their
friends for burial, but concealed them that they might appear to be
ignorant of the murder. They did not however escape detection; the whole
city perceived it, and all men withdrew from them as executioners, as
malefactors and robbers. Moreover they overthrew monasteries, and
endeavoured to cast monks into the fire; they plundered houses, and
breaking into the house of certain free citizens where the Bishop had
deposited a treasure, they plundered and took it away. They scourged the
widows on the soles of their feet, and hindered them from receiving
their alms.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p56"></span>73. *Character of Arian nominees.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p57"></span>Such were the iniquities practised by
the Arians; and as to their further deeds of impiety, who could hear the
account of them without shuddering? They had caused these venerable old
men and aged Bishops to be sent into banishment; they now appointed in
their stead profligate heathen youths, whom they thought to raise at
once to the highest dignity, though they were not even Catechumens <span
id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758.md) . And others who were accused of
bigamy <span id="fr_1759"></span>[1760](#fn_1759.md) , and even of worse
crimes, they nominated Bishops on account of the wealth and civil power
which they possessed, and sent them out as it were from a market, upon
their giving them gold. And now more dreadful calamities befel the
people. For when they rejected these mercenary dependents of the Arians,
so alien from themselves, they were scourged, they were proscribed, they
were shut up in prison by the General (who did all this readily, being a
Manichee), in order that they might no longer seek after their own
Bishops, but be forced to accept those whom they abominated, men who
were now guilty of the same mockeries as they had before practised among
their idols.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p60"></span>74. *The Episcopal appointments of
Constantius a mark of Antichrist.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p61"></span>Will not every just person break forth
into lamentations at the sight or hearing of these things, at perceiving
the arrogance and extreme injustice of these impious men? ‘The righteous
lament in the place of the impious <span
id="fr_1760"></span>[1761](#fn_1760.md) .’ After all these things, and now
that the impiety has reached such a pitch of audacity, who will any
longer venture to call this <span id="page_298">p. 298</span> <span
id="xx.ii.viii-Page_298"></span>Costyllius <span
id="fr_1761"></span>[1762](#fn_1761.md) a Christian, and not rather the
image of Antichrist? For what mark of Antichrist is yet wanting? How can
he in any way fail to be regarded as that one? or how can the latter
fail to be supposed such a one as he is? Did not the Arians and the
Gentiles offer those sacrifices in the great Church in the
Cæsareum <span id="fr_1762"></span>[1763](#fn_1762.md) , and utter their
blasphemies against Christ as by His command? And does not the vision of
Daniel thus describe <span id="fr_1763"></span>[1764](#fn_1763.md)
Antichrist; that he shall make war with the saints, and prevail against
them, and exceed all that have been before him in evil deeds and shall
humble three kings, and speak words against the Most High, and shall
think to change times and laws? Now what other person besides
Constantius has ever attempted to do these things? He is surely such a
one as Antichrist would be. He speaks words against the Most High by
supporting this impious heresy: he makes war against the saints by
banishing the Bishops; although indeed he exercises this power but for a
little while <span id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764.md) to his own
destruction. Moreover he has surpassed those before him in wickedness,
having devised a new mode of persecution; and after he had overthrown
three kings, namely Vetranio, Magnentius, and Gallus, he straightway
undertook the patronage of impiety; and like a giant <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765.md) he has dared in his pride to set
himself up against the Most High. He has thought to change laws, by
transgressing the ordinance of the Lord given us through His Apostles,
by altering the customs of the Church, and inventing a new kind of
appointments. For he sends from strange places, distant a fifty days’
journey <span id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766.md) , Bishops attended by
soldiers to people unwilling to receive them; and instead of an
introduction to the acquaintance of their people, they bring with them
threatening messages and letters to the magistrates. Thus he sent
Gregory from Cappadocia <span id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767.md) to
Alexandria; he transferred Germinius from Cyzicus to Sirmium; he removed
Cecropius from Laodicea to Nicomedia.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p70"></span>75. *Arrival of George at Alexandria,
and proceedings of Constantius in Italy.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p71"></span>Again he transferred from Cappadocia to
Milan one Auxentius <span id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768.md) , an
intruder rather than a Christian, whom he commanded to stay there, after
he had banished for his piety towards Christ Dionysius the Bishop of the
place, a godly man. But this person was as yet even ignorant of the
Latin language, and unskilful in everything except impiety. And now one
George, a Cappadocian, who was contractor of stores <span
id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769.md) at Constantinople, and having
embezzled all monies that he received, was obliged to fly, he commanded
to enter Alexandria with military pomp, and supported by the authority
of the General. Next, finding one Epictetus <span
id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770.md) a novice, a bold young man, he
loved him <span id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771.md) , perceiving that
he was ready for wickedness; and by his means he carries on his designs
against those of the Bishops whom he desires to ruin. For he is prepared
to do everything that the Emperor wishes; who accordingly availing
himself of his assistance, has committed at Rome a strange act, but one
truly resembling the malice of Antichrist. Having made preparations in
the Palace instead of the Church, and caused some three of his own
eunuchs to attend instead of the people, he then compelled three <span
id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772.md) ill-conditioned spies <span
id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773) (for one cannot call them Bishops.md),
to ordain forsooth as Bishop one Felix <span
id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774.md) , a man worthy of them, then in the
Palace. For the people perceiving the iniquitous proceedings of the
heretics would not allow them to enter the Churches <span
id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775.md) , and withdrew themselves far from
them.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p80"></span>76. *Tyrannous banishment of Bishops by
Constantius.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p81"></span>Now what is yet wanting to make him
Antichrist? or what more could Antichrist do at his coming than this man
has done? Will he not find when he comes that the way has been already
prepared for him by this man easily to deceive the people? Again <span
id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776.md) , he claims to himself the right of
deciding causes, which he refers to the Court instead of the Church, and
presides at them in person. And strange it is to say, when he perceives
the accusers at a <span id="page_299">p. 299</span> <span
id="xx.ii.viii-Page_299"></span>loss, he takes up the accusation
himself, so that the injured party may no longer be able to defend
himself on account of the violence which he displays. This he did in the
proceedings against Athanasius. For when he saw the boldness of the
Bishops Paulinus, Lucifer, Eusebius, and Dionysius, and how out of the
recantation of Ursacius and Valens <span
id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777.md) they confuted those who spoke
against the Bishop, and advised that Valens and his fellows should no
longer be believed, since they had already retracted what they now
asserted, he immediately stood up <span
id="fr_1778"></span>[1779](#fn_1778.md) and said, ‘I am now the accuser of
Athanasius; on my account you must believe what these assert.’ And then,
when they said,—‘But how can you be an accuser, when the accused person
is not present? for if you are his accuser, yet he is not present, and
therefore cannot be tried. And the cause is not one that concerns Rome,
so that you should be believed as being the Emperor; but it is a matter
that concerns a Bishop; for the trial ought to be conducted on equal
terms both to the accuser and the accused. And besides, how can you
accuse him? for you could not be present to witness the conduct of one
who lived at so great a distance from you; and if you speak but what you
have heard from these, you ought also to give credit to what he says;
but if you will not believe him, while you do believe them, it is plain
that they assert these things for your sake, and accuse Athanasius only
to gratify you?’—when he heard this, thinking that what they had so
truly spoken was an insult to himself, he sent them into banishment; and
being exasperated against Athanasius, he wrote in a more savage strain,
requiring that he should suffer what has now befallen him, and that the
Churches should be given up to the Arians, and that they should be
allowed to do whatever they pleased.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p85"></span>77. *Constantius the precursor of
Antichrist.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p86"></span>Terrible indeed, and worse than
terrible are such proceedings; yet conduct suitable to him who assumes
the character of Antichrist. Who that beheld him taking the lead of his
pretended Bishops, and presiding in Ecclesiastical causes, would not
justly exclaim that this was ‘the abomination of desolation <span
id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779.md) ’ spoken of by Daniel? For having
put on the profession of Christianity, and entering into the holy
places, and standing therein, he lays waste the Churches, transgressing
their Canons, and enforcing the observance of his own decrees. Will any
one now venture to say that this is a peaceful time with Christians, and
not a time of persecution? A persecution indeed, such as never arose
before, and such as no one perhaps will again stir up, except ‘the son
of lawlessness <span id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780.md) ,’ do these
enemies of Christ exhibit, who already present a picture of him in their
own persons. Wherefore it especially behoves us to be sober, lest this
heresy which has reached such a height of impudence, and has diffused
itself abroad like the ‘poison of an adder <span
id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781.md) ,’ as it is written in the
Proverbs, and which teaches doctrines contrary to the Saviour; lest, I
say, this be that ‘falling away <span
id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782.md) ,’ after which He shall be
revealed, of whom Constantius is surely the forerunner <span
id="fr_1783"></span>[1784](#fn_1783.md) . Else wherefore is he so mad
against the godly? wherefore does he contend for it as his own heresy,
and call every one his enemy who will not comply with the madness of
Arius, and admit gladly the allegations of the enemies of Christ, and
dishonour so many venerable Councils? why did he command that the
Churches should be given up to the Arians? was it not that, when that
other comes, he may thus find a way to enter into them, and may take to
himself him who has prepared those places for him? For the ancient
Bishops who were ordained by Alexander, and by his predecessor Achillas,
and by Peter before him, have been cast out; and those introduced whom
the companions of soldiers nominated; and they nominated only such as
promised to adopt their doctrines.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p92"></span>78. *Alliance of Meletians with
Arians.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p93"></span>This was an easy proposition for the
Meletians to comply with; for the greater part, or rather the whole of
them, have never had a religious education, nor are they acquainted with
the ‘sound faith <span id="fr_1784"></span>[1785](#fn_1784.md) ’ in Christ,
nor do they know at all what Christianity is, or what writings we
Christians possess. For having come out, some of them from the worship
of idols, and others from the senate, or from the first civil offices,
for the sake of the miserable exemption <span
id="fr_1785"></span>[1786](#fn_1785.md) from duty and for the patronage
they gained, and having bribed <span
id="fr_1786"></span>[1787](#fn_1786.md) the Meletians who preceded them,
they have been advanced to this dignity even before they had been under
instruction. And even if they pretended to have been such, yet what kind
of instruction is to be obtained among the Meletians? But indeed without
even pretending to be under instruction, they came at once, and
immediately were called Bishops, just as children receive a name. Being
then persons of this description, they thought the thing of no great
consequence, nor even supposed that piety was different from <span
id="page_300">p. 300</span> <span
id="xx.ii.viii-Page_300"></span>impiety. Accordingly from being
Meletians they readily and speedily became Arians; and if the Emperor
should command them to adopt any other profession, they are ready to
change again to that also. Their ignorance of true godliness quickly
brings them to submit to the prevailing folly, and that which happens to
be first taught them. For it is nothing to them to be carried about by
every wind <span id="fr_1787"></span>[1788](#fn_1787.md) and tempest, so
long as they are only exempt from duty, and obtain the patronage of men;
nor would they scruple probably to change again <span
id="fr_1788"></span>[1789](#fn_1788.md) to what they were before, even to
become such as they were when they were heathens. Any how, being men of
such an easy temper, and considering the Church as a civil senate, and
like heathen being idolatrously minded, they put on the honourable
name <span id="fr_1789"></span>[1790](#fn_1789.md) of the Saviour, under
which they polluted the whole of Egypt, by causing so much as the name
of the Arian heresy to be known therein. For Egypt has heretofore been
the only country, throughout which the profession of the orthodox faith
was boldly maintained <span id="fr_1790"></span>[1791](#fn_1790.md) ; and
therefore these misbelievers have striven to introduce jealousy there
also, or rather not they, but the devil who has stirred them up, in
order that when his herald Antichrist shall come, he may find that the
Churches in Egypt also are his own, and that the Meletians have already
been instructed in his principles, and may recognise himself as already
formed <span id="fr_1791"></span>[1792](#fn_1791.md) in them.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p102"></span>79. *Behaviour of the Meletians
contrasted with that of the Alexandrian Christians.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p103"></span>Such is the effect of that iniquitous
order which was issued by Constantius. On the part of the people there
was displayed a ready alacrity to submit to martyrdom, and an increased
hatred of this most impious heresy; and yet lamentations for their
Churches, and groans burst from all, while they cried unto the Lord,
‘Spare Thy people, O Lord, and give not Thine heritage unto Thine
enemies to reproach <span id="fr_1792"></span>[1793](#fn_1792.md) ;’ but
make haste to deliver us out of the hand of the lawless <span
id="fr_1793"></span>[1794](#fn_1793.md) . For behold, ‘they have not spared
Thy servants, but are preparing the way for Antichrist.’ For the
Meletians will never resist him, nor will they care for the truth, nor
will they esteem it an evil thing to deny Christ. They are men who have
not approached the word with sincerity; like the chameleon <span
id="fr_1794"></span>[1795](#fn_1794.md) they assume every various
appearance; they are hirelings of any who will make use of them. They
make not the truth their aim, but prefer before it their present
pleasure; they say only, ‘Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we
die <span id="fr_1795"></span>[1796](#fn_1795.md) .’ Such a profession and
faithless temper is more worthy of Epicritian <span
id="fr_1796"></span>[1797](#fn_1796.md) players than of Meletians. But the
faithful servants of our Saviour, and the true Bishops who believe with
sincerity, and live not for themselves, but for the Lord; these
faithfully believing in our Lord Jesus Christ, and knowing, as I said
before, that the charges which were alleged against the truth were
false, and plainly fabricated for the sake of the Arian heresy (for by
the recantation <span id="fr_1797"></span>[1798](#fn_1797.md) of Ursacius
and Valens they detected the calumnies which were devised against
Athanasius, for the purpose of removing him out of the way, and of
introducing into the Churches the impieties of the enemies of Christ);
these, I say, perceiving all this, as defenders and preachers of the
truth, chose rather, and endured to be insulted and driven into
banishment, than to subscribe against him, and to hold communion with
the Arian madmen. They forgot not the lessons they had taught to others;
yea, they know well that great dishonour remains for the traitors, but
for them which confess the truth, the kingdom of heaven; and that to the
careless and such as fear Constantius will happen no good thing; but for
them that endure tribulations here, as sailors reach a quiet haven after
a storm, as wrestlers receive a crown after the combat, so these shall
obtain great and eternal joy and delight in heaven;—such as Joseph
obtained after those tribulations; such as the great Daniel had after
his temptations and the manifold conspiracies of the courtiers against
him; such as Paul now enjoys, being crowned by the Saviour; such as the
people of God everywhere expect. They, seeing these things, were not
infirm of purpose, but waxed strong in faith <span
id="fr_1798"></span>[1799](#fn_1798.md) , and increased in their zeal more
and more. Being fully persuaded of the calumnies and impieties of the
heretics, they condemn the persecutor, and in heart and mind run
together the same course with them that are persecuted, that they also
may obtain the crown of Confession.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p111"></span>80. *Duty of separating from
heretics.*

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p112"></span>One might say much more against this
detestable and antichristian heresy, and might demonstrate by many
arguments that the practices of Constantius are a prelude to the coming
of Antichrist. But seeing that, as the Prophet <span
id="fr_1799"></span>[1800](#fn_1799.md) has said, from the feet even to the
head there is no reasonableness in it, but it is full of all filthiness
and all impiety, so that the very name of it ought to be avoided as a
dog’s vomit or the <span id="page_301">p. 301</span> <span
id="xx.ii.viii-Page_301"></span>poison of serpents; and seeing that
Costyllius openly exhibits the image of the adversary <span
id="fr_1800"></span>[1801](#fn_1800.md) ; in order that our words may not
be too many, it will be well to content ourselves with the divine
Scripture, and that we all obey the precept which it has given us both
in regard to other heresies, and especially respecting this. That
precept is as follows; ‘Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence,
touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of them, and be ye
separate, that bear the vessels of the Lord <span
id="fr_1801"></span>[1802](#fn_1801.md) .’ This may suffice <span
id="fr_1802"></span>[1803](#fn_1802.md) to instruct us all, so that if any
one has been deceived by them, he may go out from them, as out of Sodom,
and not return again unto them, lest he suffer the fate of Lot’s wife;
and if any one has continued from the beginning pure from this impious
heresy, he may glory in Christ and say, ‘We have not stretched out our
hands to a strange god <span id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803.md) ;
neither have we worshipped the works of our own hands, nor served the
creature <span id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804.md) more than Thee, the
God that hast created all things through Thy word, the Only-Begotten Son
our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom to Thee the Father together with the
same Word in the Holy Spirit be glory and power for ever and ever.
Amen.’

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p119"></span>81. *The Second Protest* <span
id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805.md) .

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p121"></span>The people of the Catholic Church in
Alexandria, which is under the government of the most Reverend Bishop
Athanasius, make this public protest by those whose names are
under-written.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p122"></span>We have already protested against the
nocturnal assault which was committed upon ourselves and the Lord’s
house; although in truth there needed no protest in respect to
proceedings with which the whole city has been already made acquainted.
For the bodies of the slain which were discovered were exposed in
public, and the bows and arrows and other arms found in the Lord’s house
loudly proclaim the iniquity.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p123"></span>But whereas after our Protest already
made, the most illustrious Duke Syrianus endeavours to force all men to
agree with him, as though no tumult had been made, nor any had perished
(wherein is no small proof that these things were not done according to
the wishes of the most gracious Emperor Augustus Constantius; for he
would not have been so much afraid of the consequences of this
transaction, had he acted therein by command); and whereas also, when we
went to him, and requested him not to do violence to any, nor to deny
what had taken place, he ordered us, being Christians, to be beaten with
clubs; thereby again giving proof of the nocturnal assault which has
been directed against the Church:—

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p124"></span>We therefore make also this present
Protest, certain of us being now about to travel to the most religious
Emperor Augustus: and we adjure Maximus the Prefect of Egypt, and the
Controllers <span id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806.md) , in the name of
Almighty God, and for the sake of the salvation of the most religious
Augustus Constantius, to relate all these things to the piety of
Augustus, and to the authority of the most illustrious Prefects <span
id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807.md) . We adjure also the masters of
vessels, to publish these things everywhere, and to carry them to the
ears of the most religious Augustus, and to the Prefects and the
Magistrates in every place, in order that it may be known that a war has
been waged against the Church, and that, in the times of Augustus
Constantius, Syrianus has caused virgins and many others to become
martyrs.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p127"></span>As it dawned upon the fifth before the
Ides of February <span id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808.md) , that is to
say, the fourteenth of the month Mechir, while we were keeping
vigil <span id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809.md) in the Lord’s house,
and engaged in our prayers (for there was to be a communion on the
Preparation <span id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810) .md); suddenly about
midnight, the most illustrious Duke Syrianus attacked us and the Church
with many legions of soldiers <span id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811.md)
armed with naked swords and javelins and other warlike instruments, and
wearing helmets on their heads; and actually while we were praying, and
while the lessons were being read, they broke down the doors. And when
the doors were burst open by the violence of the multitude, he gave
command, and some of them were shooting; others shouting, their arms
rattling, and their swords flashing in the light of the lamps; and
forthwith virgins were being slain, many men trampled down, and falling
over one another as the soldiers came upon them, and several were
pierced with arrows and perished. Some of the soldiers also were
betaking themselves to plunder, and were stripping the virgins, who were
more afraid of being even touched by them than they were of death. The
Bishop continued sitting upon his throne, and exhorted all to pray. The
Duke led on the attack, having with him Hilarius the notary, whose part
in the proceedings was shewn in the <span id="page_302">p. 302</span>
<span id="xx.ii.viii-Page_302"></span>sequel. The Bishop was seized, and
barely escaped being torn to pieces; and having fallen into a state of
insensibility, and appearing as one dead, he disappeared from among
them, and has gone we know not whither. They were eager to kill him. And
when they saw that many had perished, they gave orders to the soldiers
to remove out of sight the bodies of the dead. But the most holy virgins
who were left behind were buried in the tombs, having attained the glory
of martyrdom in the times of the most religious Constantius. Deacons
also were beaten with stripes even in the Lord’s house, and were shut up
there.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p132"></span>Nor did matters stop even here: for
after all this had happened, whosoever pleased broke open any door that
he could, and searched, and plundered what was within. They entered even
into those places which not even all Christians are allowed to enter.
Gorgonius, the commander of the city force <span
id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812.md) , knows this, for he was present.
And no unimportant evidence of the nature of this hostile assault is
afforded by the circumstance, that the armour and javelins and swords
borne by those who entered were left in the Lord’s house. They have been
hung up in the Church until this time, that they might not be able to
deny it: and although they sent several times Dynamius the soldier <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813.md) , as well as the Commander <span
id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814.md) of the city police, desiring to
take them away, we would not allow it, until the circumstance was known
to all.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p136"></span>Now if an order has been given that we
should be persecuted we are all ready to suffer martyrdom. But if it be
not by order of Augustus, we desire Maximus the Prefect of Egypt and all
the city magistrates to request of him that they may not again be
suffered thus to assail us. And we desire also that this our petition
may be presented to him, that they may not attempt to bring in hither
any other Bishop: for we have resisted unto death <span
id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815.md) , desiring to have the most
Reverend Athanasius, whom God gave us at the beginning, according to the
succession of our fathers; whom also the most religious Augustus
Constantius himself sent to us with letters and oaths. And we believe
that when his Piety is informed of what has taken place, he will be
greatly displeased, and will do nothing contrary to his oaths, but will
again give orders that our Bishop Athanasius shall remain with us.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p138"></span>To the Consuls to be elected <span
id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816.md) after the Consulship of the most
illustrious Arbæthion and Collianus <span
id="fr_1817"></span>[1818](#fn_1817.md) , on the seventeenth Mechir <span
id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818.md) , which is the day before the Ides
of February.

id="xx.ii.viii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p23"></span> The early theory about persecution
seems to have been this,—that that was a bad cause which ‘depended’ upon
it, but that, when a ‘cause’ was good, there was nothing wrong in using
force in due ‘subordination’ to argument \[so Pius IX. in *Encycl.*
‘Quanta cura,’ speaks of the ’officium coercendi sancitis pœnis
violatores catholicæ religionis\]; that there was as little impropriety
in the civil magistrate’s inducing ‘individuals’ by force, when they
were incapable of higher motives, as by those secular blessings which
follow on Christianity. Our Lord’s kingdom was not of this world, that
is, it did not depend on this world; but, as subduing, engrossing, and
swaying this world, it at times condescended to make use of this world’s
weapons against itself. The simple question was ‘whether a cause
depended on force for its existence.’ S. Athanasius declared and the
event proved, that Arianism was so dependent. When Emperors ceased to
persecute, Arianism ceased to be; it had no life in itself. Again, all
cruel persecution, or long continued, or on a large scale, was wrong, as
arguing ‘an absence’ of moral and rational grounds in the ‘cause’ so
maintained. Again, there was an evident ‘impropriety’ in ecclesiastical
functionaries using secular weapons, as there would be in their engaging
in a secular pursuit, or forming secular connections; whereas the
soldier might as suitably, and should as dutifully, defend religion with
the sword, as the scholar with his pen. And further there was an
abhorrence of cruelty natural to us, which it was a duty to cherish and
maintain. All this being considered, there is no inconsistency in S.
Athanasius denouncing persecution, and in Theodosius decreeing that ‘the
heretical teachers, who usurped the sacred titles of Bishops or
Presbyters,’ should be ‘exposed to the heavy penalties of exile and
confiscation.’ Gibbon, *Hist.* ch. 27. For a list of passages from the
Fathers on the subject, vid. Limborch on the Inquisition, vol. 1.

persecution, vid. Gerhard *de Magistr. Polit.* p. 741, &c. \[But vide

Montfaucon translated ‘stage-player.’ It is a question whether more than
‘actor’ is meant by it, alluding to the mockery of an ordination in
which he seems to have taken part. Though an Asiatic apparently by
birth, he was made Bishop of Civita Vecchia. We hear of him at the
conference between Constantius and Liberius. Theod. *H. E.* ii. 13. Then
he assists in the ordination of Felix. Afterwards he made a martyr of S.
Ruffinian by making him run before his carriage; and he ends his
historical career by taking a chief part among the Arians at Ariminum.

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p120"></span> Of the two Protests referred to supr.
§48, the first was omitted by the copyists, as being already contained,
as Montfaucon seems to say, in the Apology against the Arians; yet if it
be the one to which allusion is made in the beginning of the Protest
which follows, it is not found there, nor does it appear what document
of <span class="c10"><span id="xx.ii.viii-p120.2"></span>a.d.</span> 356
could properly have a place in a set of papers which end with <span

<span id="xx.ii.viii-p139"></span> Since the Consuls came into office on
the first of January, and were proclaimed in each city, it is strange
that the Alexandrians here speak in February as if ignorant of their
names. The phrase, however, is found elsewhere. Thus in this very year
the *Chron. Aceph.* dates Jan. 5 as ‘post Consulatum Arbitionis et
Loliani.’ And in Socr. *Hist.* ii. 29, in the instance of the year 351,
when there were no Consuls, and in 346, when there was a difference on
the subject between the Emperors who were eventually themselves Consuls,
the first months are dated in like manner from the Consuls of the
foregoing year.
