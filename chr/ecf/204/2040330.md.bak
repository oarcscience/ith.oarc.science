<span id="xix.ii.xxvii-p1"></span> 27. *Conclusion.*

<span id="xix.ii.xxvii-p2"></span>Thus each surpasses the other in his
own peculiar vices. But there is a common blot that attaches to them
all, in that through their heresy they are enemies of Christ, and are no
<span id="page_265">p. 265</span> <span
id="xix.ii.xxvii-Page_265"></span>longer called Christians <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md) , but Arians. They ought indeed to
accuse each other of the sins they are guilty of, for they are contrary
to the faith of Christ; but they rather conceal them for their own
sakes. And it is no wonder, that being possessed of such a spirit, and
implicated in such vices, they persecute and seek after those who follow
not the same impious heresy as themselves; that they delight to destroy
them, and are grieved if they fail of obtaining their desires, and think
themselves injured, as I said before, when they see those alive whom
they wish to perish. May they continue to be injured in such sort, that
they may lose the power of inflicting injuries, and that those whom they
persecute may give thanks unto the Lord, and say in the words of the
twenty-sixth Psalm, ‘The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom then
shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I
be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me
to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md) ;’ and again the thirtieth Psalm,
‘Thou hast saved my soul from adversities; thou hast not shut me up into
the hands of mine enemies; thou hast set my foot in a large room <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) ’ in Christ Jesus our Lord, through
whom to the Father in the Holy Spirit be glory and power for ever and
ever. Amen.
