<span id="iii.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Tractate XLV.</span>

<span id="iii.xlvi-p2"></span><span id="iii.xlvi-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.xlvi-p2.2"></span>Chapter X. 1–10</span>

<span id="iii.xlvi-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.xlvi-p3.1"></span>Our</span> Lord’s discourse to the Jews began
in connection with the man who was born blind and was restored to sight.
Your Charity therefore ought to know and be advised that today’s lesson
is interwoven with that one. For when the Lord had said, “For judgment I
am come into this world; that they who see not might see, and they who
see might be made blind,”—which, on the occasion of its reading, we
expounded according to our <span id="page_250">p. 250</span> <span
id="iii.xlvi-Page_250"></span>ability,—some of the Pharisees said, “Are
we blind also?” To whom He replied, “If ye were blind, ye should have no
sin: but now ye say, We see; \[therefore\] your sin remaineth.” <span
id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845.md) To these words He added what we have
been hearing today when the lesson was read.

<span id="iii.xlvi-p5"></span>2. “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He
that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some
other way, the same is a thief and a robber.” For they declared that
they were not blind; yet could they see only by being the sheep of
Christ. Whence claimed they possession of the light, who were acting as
thieves against the day? Because, then, of their vain and proud and
incurable arrogance, did the Lord Jesus subjoin these words, wherein He
has given us also salutary lessons, if we lay them to heart. For there
are many who, according to a custom of this life, are called good
people,—good men, good women, innocent, and observers as it were of what
is commanded in the law; paying respect to their parents, abstaining
from adultery, doing no murder, committing no theft, giving no false
witness against any one, and observing all else that the law
requires—yet are not Christians; and for the most part ask boastfully,
like these men, “Are we blind also?” But just because all these things
that they do, and know not to what end they should have reference, they
do to no purpose, the Lord has set forth in today’s lesson the
similitude of His own flock, and of the door that leads into the
sheepfold. Pagans may say, then, We live well. If they enter not by the
door, what good will that do them, whereof they boast? For to this end
ought good living to benefit every one, that it may be given him to live
for ever: for to whomsoever eternal life is not given, of what benefit
is the living well? For they ought not to be spoken of as even living
well, who either from blindness know not the end of a right life, or in
their pride despise it. But no one has the true and certain hope of
living always, unless he know the life, that it is Christ; and enter by
the gate into the sheepfold.

<span id="iii.xlvi-p6"></span>3. Such, accordingly, for the most part
seek to persuade men to live well, and yet not to be Christians. By
another way they wish to climb up, to steal and to kill, not as the
shepherd, to preserve and to save. And thus there have been certain
philosophers, holding many subtle discussions about the virtues and the
vices, dividing, defining, drawing out to their close the most acute
processes of reasoning, filling books, brandishing their wisdom with
rattling jaws; who would even dare to say to people, Follow us, keep to
our sect, if you would live happily. But they had not entered by the
door: they wished to destroy, to slay, and to murder.

<span id="iii.xlvi-p7"></span>4. What shall I say of such? Look, the
Pharisees themselves were in the habit of reading, and in what they
read, their voices re-echoed the Christ, they hoped He would come, and
recognized Him not when present; they boasted, even they, of being
amongst those who saw, that is, among the wise, and they disowned the
Christ, and entered not in by the door. Therefore would such also, if
they chanced to seduce any, seduce them to be slaughtered and murdered,
not to be brought into liberty. Let us leave these also to themselves,
and look at those who glory in the name of Christ Himself, and see
whether even they perchance are entering in by the door.

<span id="iii.xlvi-p8"></span>5. For there are countless numbers who not
only boast that they see, but would have it appear that they are
enlightened by Christ; yet are they heretics. Have even they somehow
entered by the gate? Surely not. Sabellius says, He who is the Son is
Himself the Father; but if the Son, then is there no Father. He enters
not by the door, who asserts that the Son is the Father. Arius says, The
Father is one thing, the Son is another thing. He would say rightly if
he said, Another person; but not another thing. <span
id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846.md) For when he says, Another thing, he
contradicts Him who says in his hearing, “I and my Father are
One.” <span id="fr_847"></span>[848](#fn_847.md) Neither does he therefore
enter by the door; for he preaches a Christ such as he fabricates for
himself, not such as the truth declares Him. Thou hast the name, thou
hast not the reality. Christ is the name of something; keep hold of the
thing itself, if thou wouldst benefit by the name. Another, I know not
from whence, says with Photinus, <span id="fr_848"></span>[849](#fn_848.md)
Christ is mere man; He is not God. He enters not in by the door, for
Christ is both man and God. But why need I make many references, and
enumerate the many vanities of heretics? Keep hold of this, that
Christ’s sheepfold is the Catholic Church. Whoever would enter the
sheepfold, let him enter by the door, let him preach the true Christ.
Not only let him preach the true Christ, but seek Christ’s glory, not
his own; for many, by seeking their own glory, have scattered Christ’s
sheep, instead of gathering them. For Christ the Lord is a low gateway:
he who <span id="page_251">p. 251</span> <span
id="iii.xlvi-Page_251"></span>enters by this gateway must humble
himself, that he may be able to enter with head unharmed. But he that
humbleth not, but exalteth himself, wishes to climb over the wall; and
he that climbeth over the wall, is exalted only to fall.

<span id="iii.xlvi-p12"></span>6. Thus far, however, the Lord Jesus
speaks in covert language; not as yet is He understood. He names the
door, He names the sheepfold, He names the sheep: all this He sets
forth, but does not yet explain. Let us read on then, for He is coming
to those words, wherein He may think proper to give us some explanation
of what He has said; from the explanation of which He will perhaps
enable us to understand also what He has not explained. For He gives us
what is plain, for food; what is obscure, for exercise. “He that
entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other
way.” Woe to the wretch, for he is sure to fall! Let him then be humble,
let him enter by the door: let him walk on the level ground, and he
shall not stumble. “The same,” He says, “is a thief and a robber.” The
sheep of another he desires to call his own sheep,—his own, that is, as
carried off by stealth, for the purpose, not of saving, but of slaying
them. Therefore is he a thief, because what is another’s he calls his
own; a robber, because what he has stolen he also kills. “But he that
entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep: to him the porter
openeth.” Concerning this porter we shall make inquiry, when we have
heard of the Lord Himself what is the door and who is the shepherd. “And
the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name.” For He
has their names written in the book of life. “He calleth his own sheep
by name.” Hence, says the apostle, “The Lord knoweth them that are
His.” <span id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849.md) “And he leadeth them out.
And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the
sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a stranger do they not
follow, but do flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.”
These are veiled words, full of topics of inquiry, pregnant with
sacramental signs. Let us follow then, and listen to the Master as He
makes some opening into these obscurities; and perhaps by the opening He
makes, He will cause us to enter.

<span id="iii.xlvi-p14"></span>7. “This parable spake Jesus unto them;
but they understood not what He spake unto them.” Nor we also, perhaps.
What, then, is the difference between them and us, before even we can
understand these words? This, that we on our part knock, that it may be
opened unto us; while they, by disowning Christ, refused to enter for
salvation, and preferred remaining outside to be destroyed. In as far,
then, as we listen to these words with a pious mind, in as far as,
before we understand them, we believe them to be true and divine, we
stand at a great distance from these men. For when two persons are
listening to the words of the gospel, the one impious, the other pious,
and some of these are such as neither perhaps understands, the one says,
It has said nothing; the other says, It has said the truth, and what it
has said is good, but we do not understand it. This latter, because he
believes, now knocks, that he may be worthy to have it opened up to him,
if he continue knocking; but the other still hears the words, “If ye
believe not, ye shall not understand.” <span
id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850.md) Why do I draw your attention to this?
Even for this reason, that when I have explained as I can these obscure
words, or, because of their great abstruseness, I have either myself
failed to arrive at an understanding of them, or wanted the faculty of
explaining what I do understand, or every one has been so dull as not to
follow me, even when I give the explanation, yet should he not despair
of himself; but continue in faith, walk on in the way, and hear the
apostle saying, “And if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall
reveal even this unto you. Nevertheless whereto we have already
attained, let us walk therein.” <span id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851.md)

<span id="iii.xlvi-p17"></span>8. Let us begin, then, with hearing His
exposition of what we have heard Him propounding. “Then said Jesus unto
them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.”
See, He has opened the very door which was shut in His former
description. He Himself is the door. We have come to know it; let us
enter, or rejoice that we are already within. “All that ever came are
thieves and robbers.” What is this, Lord, “All that ever came”? How so
hast Thou not come? But understand; I said, “All that ever came,”
meaning, of course, exclusive of myself. <span
id="fr_852"></span>[853](#fn_852.md) Let us recollect then. Before His
coming came the prophets: were they thieves and robbers? God forbid.
They did not come apart from Him, for they came <span id="page_252">p.
252</span> <span id="iii.xlvi-Page_252"></span>with Him. When about to
come, He sent heralds, but retained possession of the hearts of His
messengers. Do you wish to know that they came with Him, who is Himself
ever existent? Certainly He assumed human flesh at the time appointed.
But what means that “ever”? “In the beginning was the Word.”  <span
id="fr_853"></span>[854](#fn_853.md) With Him, therefore, came those who
came with the word of God. “I am,” said He, “the way, and the truth, and
the life.” <span id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854.md) If He is the truth,
with Him came those who were truthful. As many, therefore, as were apart
from Him, were “thieves and robbers,” that is, had come to steal and to
destroy.

<span id="iii.xlvi-p21"></span>9. “But the sheep did not hear them.”
This is a more important point, “the sheep did not hear them.” Before
the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ, when He came in humility in the
flesh, righteous men preceded, believing in the same way in Him who was
to come, as we believe in Him who has come. Times vary, but not faith.
For verbs themselves also vary with the tense, when they are variously
declined. He is to come, has one sound; He has come, has another: there
is a change in the sound between He is to come, and He has come: <span
id="fr_855"></span>[856](#fn_855.md) yet the same faith unites both,—both
those who believed that He would come, and those who have believed that
He is come. At different times, indeed, but by the one doorway of faith,
that is, by Christ, do we see that both have entered. We believe that
the Lord Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin, that He came in the flesh,
suffered, rose again, ascended into heaven: all this, just as you hear
verbs of the past tense, we believe to be already fulfilled. In that
faith a partnership is also held with us by those fathers who believed
that He would be born of the Virgin, would suffer, would rise again,
would ascend into heaven; for to such the apostle pointed when he said,
“But we having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I
believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore
speak.” <span id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856.md) The prophet said, “I
believed, therefore have I spoken:” <span
id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857.md) the apostle says, “We also believe,
and therefore speak.” But to let you know that their faith is one,
listen to him saying, “Having the same spirit of faith, we also
believe.” So also in another place, “For I would not have you ignorant,
brethren, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed
through the sea: and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in
the sea; and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the
same spiritual drink.” The Red Sea signifies baptism; Moses, their
leader through the Red Sea, signifies Christ; the people, who passed
through, signify believers; the death of the Egyptians signifies the
abolition of sins. Under different signs there is the same faith. It is
with different signs as with different words \[verbs\]; for verbs change
their sounds through the tenses, and verbs are indeed nothing else than
signs. For they are words because of what they signify: take away the
meaning from a word, <span id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858.md) and it
becomes a senseless sound. All, therefore, have become signs. Was not
the same faith theirs by whom these signs were employed, and by whom
were foretold in prophecy the very things which we believe? Certainly it
was: but they believed that they were yet to come, and we, that they
have come. In like manner does he also say, “They all drank the same
spiritual drink;” “the same spiritual,” for it was not the same material
\[drink\]. For what was it they drank? “For they drank of the spiritual
Rock that followed them; and that Rock was Christ.” <span
id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859.md) See, then, how that while the faith
remained, the signs were varied. There the rock was Christ; to us that
is Christ which is placed on the altar of God. And they, as a great
sacramental sign of the same Christ, drank the water flowing from the
rock: what we drink is known to believers. If one’s thoughts turn to the
visible form, the thing is different; if to the meaning that addresses
the understanding, they drank the same spiritual drink. As many, then,
at that time as believed, whether Abraham, or Isaac, or Jacob, or Moses,
or the other patriarchs or prophets who foretold of Christ, were sheep,
and heard Christ. His voice, and not another’s, did they hear. The Judge
was present in the person of the Crier. For even when the judge speaks
through the crier, the clerk <span id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860.md)
does not make it, The crier said; but the judge said. But others there
are whom the sheep did not hear, in whom Christ’s voice had no
place,—wanderers, uttering falsehoods, prating inanities, fabricating
vanities, misleading the miserable.

<span id="iii.xlvi-p28"></span>10. Why is it, then, that I have said,
This is a more important point? What is there about it obscure and
difficult to understand? Listen, I beseech you. See, the Lord Jesus
Christ Himself came and preached. Much more surely was that the
Shepherd’s voice which was uttered by the very mouth of the <span
id="page_253">p. 253</span> <span
id="iii.xlvi-Page_253"></span>Shepherd. For if the Shepherd’s voice came
through the prophets, how much more did the Shepherd’s own tongue give
utterance to the Shepherd’s voice? Yet all did not hear Him. But what
are we to think? Those who did hear, were they sheep? Lo? Judas heard,
and was a wolf: he followed, but, clad in sheep-skin, he was laying
snares for the Shepherd. Some, again, of those who crucified Christ did
not hear, and yet were sheep; for such He saw in the crowd when He said,
“When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am
He.” <span id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md) Now, how is this question
to be solved? They that are not sheep do hear, and they that are sheep
do not hear. Some, who are wolves, follow the Shepherd’s voice; and
some, that are sheep, contradict it. Last of all, the sheep slay the
Shepherd. The point is solved; for some one in reply says, But when they
did not hear, as yet they were not sheep, they were then wolves: the
voice, when it was heard, changed them, and out of wolves transformed
them into sheep; and so, when they became sheep, they heard, and found
the Shepherd, and followed Him. They built their hopes on the Shepherd’s
promises, because they obeyed His precepts.

<span id="iii.xlvi-p30"></span>11. That question has been solved in a
way, and perhaps satisfies every one. But I bare still a subject of
concern, and what concerns me I shall impart to you, that, in some sort
inquiring together, I may through His revelation be found worthy with
you to attain the solution. Hear, then, what it is that moves me. By the
Prophet Ezekiel the Lord rebukes the shepherds, and among other things
says of the sheep, “The wandering sheep have ye not recalled.”  <span
id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md) He both declares it *a wanderer*, and
calls it *a sheep*. If, while wandering, it was a sheep, whose voice was
it hearing to lead it astray? For doubtless it would not be straying
were it hearing the shepherd’s voice: but it strayed just because it
heard another’s voice; it heard the voice of the thief and the robber.
Surely the sheep do not hear the voice of robbers. “Those that came,” He
said,—and we are to understand, *apart from me*,—that is, “those that
came *apart from me* are thieves and robbers, and the sheep did not hear
them.” Lord, if the sheep did not hear them, how can the sheep wander?
If the sheep hear only Thee, and Thou art the truth, whoever heareth the
truth cannot certainly fall into error. But they err, and are called
sheep. For if, in the very midst of their wandering, they were not
called sheep, it would not be said by Ezekiel, “The wandering sheep have
ye not recalled.” How is it at the same time a wanderer and a sheep? Has
it heard the voice of another? Surely “the sheep did not hear them.”
Accordingly many are just now being gathered into Christ’s fold, and
from being heretics are becoming catholics. They are rescued from the
thieves, and restored to the shepherds: and sometimes they murmur, and
become wearied of Him that calls them back, and have no true knowledge
of him that would murder them; nevertheless also, when, after a
struggle, those have come who are sheep, they recognize the Shepherd’s
voice, and are glad they have come, and are ashamed of their wandering.
When, then, they were glorying in that state of error as in the truth,
and were certainly not hearing the Shepherd’s voice, but were following
another, were they sheep, or were they not? If they were sheep, how can
it be the case that the sheep do not listen to aliens? If they were not
sheep, wherefore the rebuke addressed to those to whom it is said, “The
wandering sheep have ye not recalled”? In the case also of those already
become catholic Christians, and believers of good promise, evils
sometimes occur: they are seduced into error, and after their error are
restored. When they were thus seduced, and were rebaptized, or after the
companionship of the Lord’s fold were turned back again into their
former error, were they sheep, or were they not? Certainly they were
catholics. If they were faithful catholics, they were sheep. If they
were sheep, how was it that they could listen to the voice of a stranger
when the Lord saith, “The sheep did not hear them”?

<span id="iii.xlvi-p32"></span>12. You hear, brethren, the great
importance of the question. I say then, “The Lord knoweth them that are
His.” <span id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md) He knoweth those who were
foreknown, He knoweth those who were predestinated; because it is said
of Him, “For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among
many brethren. Moreover, whom He did predestinate, them He also called;
and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified, them
He also glorified. If God be for us, who can be against us?” Add to
this: “He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,
how hath He not with Him also freely given us all things?” But what
“us”? Those who are foreknown, predestinated, justified, glorified;
regarding <span id="page_254">p. 254</span> <span
id="iii.xlvi-Page_254"></span>whom there follows, “Who shall lay
anything to the charge of God’s elect?” <span
id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md) Therefore “the Lord knoweth them that
are His;” they are the sheep. Such sometimes do not know themselves, but
the Shepherd knoweth them, according to this predestination, this
foreknowledge of God, according to the election of the sheep before the
foundation of the world: for so saith also the apostle, “According as He
hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world.” <span
id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) According, then, to this divine
foreknowledge and predestination, how many sheep are outside, how many
wolves within! and how many sheep are inside, how many wolves without!
How many are now living in wantonness who will yet be chaste! how many
are blaspheming Christ who will yet believe in Him! how many are giving
themselves to drunkenness who will yet be sober! how many are preying on
other people property who will yet freely give of their own!
Nevertheless at present they are hearing the voice of another, they are
following strangers. In like manner, how many are praising within who
will yet blaspheme; are chaste who will yet be fornicators; are sober
who will wallow hereafter in drink; are standing who will by and by
fall! These are not the sheep. (For we speak of those who were
predestinated,—of those whom the Lord knoweth that they are His.) And
yet these, so long as they keep right, listen to the voice of Christ.
Yea, these hear, the others do not; and yet, according to
predestination, these are not sheep, while the others are.

<span id="iii.xlvi-p36"></span>13. There remains still the question,
which I now think may meanwhile thus be solved. There is a voice of some
kind,—there is, I say, a certain kind of voice of the Shepherd, in
respect of which the sheep hear not strangers, and in respect of which
those who are not sheep do not hear Christ. What a word is this! “He
that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.” <span
id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md) No one of His own is indifferent to
such a voice, a stranger does not hear it: for this reason also does He
announce it to the former, that he may abide perseveringly with Himself
to the end; but by one who is wanting in such persevering continuance
with Him, such a word remains unheard. One has come to Christ, and has
heard word after word of one kind and another, all of them true, all of
them salutary; and among all the rest is also this utterance, “He that
endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.” He who has heard this is
one of the sheep. But there was, perhaps, some one listening to it, who
treated it with dislike, with coldness, and heard it as that of a
stranger. If he was predestinated, he strayed for the time, but he was
not lost for ever: he returns to hear what he has neglected, to do what
he has heard. For if he is one of those who are predestinated, then both
his very wandering and his future conversion have been foreknown by God:
if he has strayed away, he will return to hear that voice of the
Shepherd, and to follow Him who saith, “He that endureth to the end, the
same shall be saved.” A good voice, brethren, it is; true and
shepherd-like, the very voice of salvation in the tabernacles of the
righteous. <span id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) For it is easy to
hear Christ, easy to praise the gospel, easy to applaud the preacher:
but to endure unto the end, is peculiar to the sheep who hear the
Shepherd’s voice. A temptation befalls thee, endure thou to the end, for
the temptation will not endure to the end. And what is that end to which
thou shalt endure? Even till thou reachest the end of thy pathway. For
as long as thou hearest not Christ, He is thine adversary in the
pathway, that is, in this mortal life. And what doth He say? “Agree with
thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him.” <span
id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md) Thou hast heard, hast believed, hast
agreed. If thou hast been at enmity, agree. If thou hast got the
opportunity of coming to an agreement, keep not up the quarrel longer.
For thou knowest not when thy way will be ended, and it is known to Him.
If thou art a sheep, and if thou endurest to the end, thou shalt be
saved: and therefore it is that His own despise not that voice, and
strangers hear it not. According to my ability, as He gave me the power,
I have either explained to you or gone over with you a subject of great
profundity. If any have failed fully to understand, let him retain his
piety, and the truth will be revealed: and let not those who have
understood vaunt themselves as swifter at the expense of the slower,
lest in their vaunting they turn out of the track, and the slower more
easily attain the goal. But let all of us be guided by Him to whom we
say, “Lead me, O Lord, in Thy way, and I will walk in Thy truth.”  <span
id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869.md)

<span id="iii.xlvi-p41"></span>14. By this, then, which the Lord hath
explained, that He Himself is the door, let us find entrance to what He
has set forth, but not explained. And indeed who it is that is the
Shepherd, although He hath not told us in the lesson we have read
to-day, yet in that which follows He very plainly tells us: “I am the
good Shepherd.” And although He had not said so, whom else but Himself
ought <span id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span
id="iii.xlvi-Page_255"></span>we to have understood in those words where
He saith, “He that entereth in by the door is the Shepherd of the sheep.
To Him the porter openeth: and the sheep hear His voice: and He calleth
His own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when He putteth forth
His own sheep, He goeth before them, and the sheep follow Him: for they
know His voice”? For who else calleth His own sheep by name, and leadeth
them hence unto eternal life, but He who knoweth the names of those that
are fore-ordained? Hence He said to His disciples, “Rejoice that your
names are written in heaven;” <span id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870.md)
for from this it is that He calleth them by name. And who else putteth
them forth, save He who putteth away their sins, that, freed from their
grievous fetters, they may be able to follow Him? And who hath gone
before them to the place whither they are to follow Him, but He who,
rising from the dead, dieth no more; and death shall have no more
dominion over Him; <span id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871.md) and who, when
He was manifest here in the flesh, said, “Father, I will that they also
whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am”? <span
id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872.md) Hence it is that He saith, “I am the
door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and
out, and find pasture.” In this He clearly shows that not only the
Shepherd, but the sheep also enter in by the door.

<span id="iii.xlvi-p45"></span>15. But what is this, “He shall go in and
out, and find pasture”? To enter indeed into the Church by Christ the
door, is eminently good; but to go out of the Church, as this same John
the evangelist saith in his epistle, “They went out from us, but they
were not of us,” <span id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873.md) is certainly
otherwise than good. Such a going out could not then be commended by the
good Shepherd, when He said, “And he shall go in and out, and find
pasture.” There is therefore not only some sort of entrance, but some
outgoing also that is good, by the good door, which is Christ. But what
is that praiseworthy and blessed outgoing? I might say, indeed, that we
enter when we engage in some inward exercise of thought; and go out,
when we take to some active work without: and since, as the apostle
saith, Christ dwelleth in our hearts by faith, <span
id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874.md) to enter by Christ is to give
ourselves to thought in accordance with that faith; but to go out by
Christ is, in accordance also with that same faith, to take to outside
works, that is to say, in the presence of others. Hence, also, we read
in a psalm, “Man goeth forth to his work;” <span
id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875.md) and the Lord Himself saith, “Let your
works shine before men.” <span id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876.md) But I
am better pleased that the Truth Himself, like a good Shepherd, and
therefore a good Teacher, hath in a certain measure reminded us how we
ought to understand His words, “He shall go in and out, and find
pasture,” when He added in the sequel, “The thief cometh not, but for to
steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life,
and that they might have it more abundantly.” For He seems to me to have
meant, That they may have life in coming in, and have it more abundantly
at their departure. For no one can pass out by the door—that is, by
Christ—to that eternal life which shall be open to the sight, unless by
the same door—that is, by the same Christ—he has entered His church,
which is His fold, to the temporal life, which is lived in faith.
Therefore, He saith, “I am come that they may have life,” that is,
faith, which worketh by love; <span id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877.md) by
which faith they enter the fold that they may live, for the just liveth
by faith: <span id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878.md) “and that they may
have it more abundantly,” who, enduring unto the end, pass out by this
same door, that is, by the faith of Christ; for as true believers they
die, and will have life more abundantly when they come whither the
Shepherd hath preceded them, where they shall die no more. Although,
therefore, there is no want of pasture even here in the fold,—for we may
understand the words “and shall find pasture” as referring to both, that
is, both to their going in and their going out,—yet there only will they
find the true pasture. where they shall be filled who hunger and thirst
after righteousness, <span id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879.md) —such
pasture as was found by him to whom it was said, “To-day shalt thou be
with me in paradise.” <span id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880.md) But how He
Himself is the door, and Himself the Shepherd, so that He also may in a
certain respect be understood as going in and out by Himself, and who is
the porter, it would be too long to inquire to-day, and, according to
the grace given us by Himself, to unfold in the way of dissertation.
