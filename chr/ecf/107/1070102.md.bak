<span id="iii.c-p2"></span><span id="iii.c-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.c-p2.2"></span>Chapter XVI. 13</span>.

<span id="iii.c-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.c-p3.1"></span>What</span> is this that the Lord said of the
Holy Spirit, when promising that He would come and teach His disciples
all truth, or guide them into all truth: “For He shall not speak of
Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak”? For this is
similar to what He said of Himself, “I can of mine own self do nothing:
as I hear, I judge.” <span id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) But when
expounding that, we said that it might be taken as referring to His
human nature; <span id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md) so that He
seemed as the Son to announce beforehand that His own obedience, whereby
He became obedient even unto the death of the cross, <span
id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615.md) would have its place also in the
judgment, when He shall judge the quick and the dead; for He shall do so
for the very reason that He is the Son of man. Wherefore He said, “The
Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son;”
for in the judgment He will appear, not in the form of God, wherein He
is equal to the Father, and cannot be seen by the wicked, but in the
form of man, in which He was made even a little lower than the angels;
although then He will come in glory, and not in His original humility,
yet in a way that will be conspicuous both to the good and to the bad.
Hence He says further: “And He hath given Him authority to execute
judgment also, because He is the Son of man.” <span
id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md) In these words of His own it is
made clear that it is not that form that will be presented in the
judgment, wherein He was when He thought it not robbery to be equal with
God; but that which He assumed when He made Himself of no
reputation. <span id="fr_1617"></span>[1618](#fn_1617.md) For He emptied
Himself in assuming the form of a servant; <span
id="fr_1618"></span>[1619](#fn_1618.md) in which, also, for the purpose of
executing judgment, He seems to have commended His obedience, when He
said, “I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I <span
id="page_381">p. 381</span> <span id="iii.c-Page_381"></span>judge.” For
Adam, by whose disobedience, as that of one man, many were made sinners,
did not judge as he heard; for he prevaricated what he heard, and of his
own self did the evil that he did; for he did not the will of God, but
his own: while this latter, by whose obedience, as that also of one man,
many are made righteous, <span id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619.md) was
not only obedient even unto the death of the cross, in respect of which
He was judged as alive from the dead; but promised also that He would be
showing obedience in the very judgment itself, wherein He is yet to act
as judge of the quick and the dead, when He said, “I can of mine own
self do nothing: as I hear, I judge.” But when it is said of the Holy
Spirit, “For He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall
hear, that shall He speak,” shall we dare to harbor the notion that it
was so said in reference to any human nature of His, or the assumption
of any creature-form? For it was the Son alone in the Trinity who
assumed the form of a servant, a form which in His case was fitted into
the unity of His person, or, in other words, that the one person, Jesus
Christ, should be the Son of God and the Son of man; and so that we
should be kept from preaching a quaternity instead of the Trinity, which
God forbid that we should do. And it is on account of this one
personality as consisting of two substances, the divine and the human,
that He sometimes speaks in accordance with that wherein He is God, as
when He says, “I and my Father are one;” <span
id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md) and sometimes in accordance with
His manhood, as in the words, “For the Father is greater than I;” <span
id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md) in accordance with which also we
have understood those words of His that are at present under discussion,
“I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge.” But in
reference to the person of the Holy Spirit, a considerable difficulty
arises how we are to understand the words, “For He shall not speak of
Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak;” since in it
there exists not one substance of Godhead and another of humanity, or of
any other creature whatsoever.

<span id="iii.c-p13"></span>2. For the fact that the Holy Spirit
appeared in bodily form, as a dove, <span
id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622.md) was a sight begun and ended at the
time: just as also, when He descended upon the disciples, there were
seen upon them cloven tongues as of fire, which also sat upon every one
of them. <span id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md) Any one, therefore,
who says that the dove was connected with the Holy Spirit in the unity
of His person, as that it and Godhead (for the Holy Spirit is God)
should go to constitute the one person of the Holy Spirit, is compelled
also to affirm the same thing of that fire; and so may understand that
he ought to assert neither. For those things in regard to the substance
of God, which needed at any time to be represented in some outward way,
and so exhibited themselves to men’s bodily senses, and then passed
away, were formed for the moment by divine power from the subservient
creation, and not from the dominant nature itself; which, ever abiding
the same, excites into action whatever it pleases; and, itself
unchangeable, changes all things else at its pleasure. In the same way
also did that voice from the cloud actually strike upon the bodily ears,
and on that bodily sense which is called the hearing; <span
id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md) and yet in no way are we to believe
that the Word of God, which is the only-begotten Son, is defined,
because He is called the Word, by syllables and sounds: for when a
sermon is in course of delivery, all the sounds cannot be pronounced
simultaneously; but the various individual sounds come, as it were, in
their own order to the birth, and succeed those which are dying away, so
that all that we have to say is completed only by the last syllable.
Very different from this, surely, is the way in which the Father
speaketh to the Son, that is to say, God to God, His Word. But this, so
far as it can be understood by man, is a matter for the understanding of
those who are fitted for the reception of solid food, and not of milk.
Since, therefore, the Holy Spirit became not man by any assumption of
humanity, and became not an angel by any assumption of angelic nature,
and as little entered into the creature-state by the assumption of any
creature-form whatever, how, in regard to Him, are we to understand
those words of our Lord, “For He shall not speak of Himself; but
whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak”? A difficult question;
yea, too difficult. May the Spirit Himself be present, that, at least up
to the measure of our power of thinking on such a subject, we may be
able to express our thoughts, and that these, according to the little
measure of my ability, may find entrance into your understanding.

<span id="iii.c-p17"></span>3. You ought, then, to be informed in the
first place, and, those of you who can, to understand, and the others,
who cannot as yet understand, to believe, that in that substantial
essence, which is God, the senses are not, as if through some material
structure of a body, distributed in their appropriate places; as, in the
mortal flesh of all animals there is in one place sight, in another
hearing, in another <span id="page_382">p. 382</span> <span
id="iii.c-Page_382"></span>taste, in another smelling, and over the
whole the sense of touch. Far be it from us to believe so in the case of
that incorporeal and immutable nature. In it, therefore, hearing and
seeing are one and the same thing. In this way smelling also is said to
exist in God; as the apostle says, “As Christ also hath loved us, and
hath given Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
sweet-smelling savor.” <span id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625.md) And
taste may be included, in accordance with which God hateth the bitter in
temper, and spueth out of His mouth those who are lukewarm, and neither
cold nor hot: <span id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626.md) and Christ our
God <span id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md) saith, “My meat is to do
the will of Him that sent me.” <span
id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628.md) There is also that divine sense of
touch, in accordance with which the spouse saith of the bridegroom: “His
left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.” <span
id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629.md) But these are not in God’s case in
different parts of the body. For when He is said to know, all are
included: both seeing, and hearing, and smelling, and tasting, and
touching; without any alteration of His substance, and without the
existence of any material element which is greater in one place and
smaller in another: and when there are any such thoughts of God in those
even who are old in years, they are the thoughts only of a childish
mind.

<span id="iii.c-p23"></span>4. Nor need you wonder that the ineffable
knowledge of God, whereby He is cognizant of all things, is, because of
the various modes of human speech designated by the names of all those
bodily senses; since even our own mind, in other words, the inner
man,—to which, while itself exercising its knowing faculty in one
uniform way, the different subjects of its knowledge are communicated by
those five messengers, as it were, of the body, when it understands,
chooses, and loves the unchangeable truth,—is said both to see the
light, whereof it is said, “That was the true light;” and to hear the
word, whereof it is said, “In the beginning was the Word;” <span
id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md) and to be susceptible of smell, of
which it is said, “We will run after the smell of thy ointments;” <span
id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631.md) and to drink of the fountain,
whereof it is said, “With Thee is the fountain of life;” <span
id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md) and to enjoy the sense of touch,
when it is said, “But it is good for me to cleave unto God;” <span
id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md) in all of which it is not different
things, but the one intelligence, that is expressed by the names of so
many senses. When, therefore, it is said of the Holy Spirit, “For He
shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He
speak,” so much the more is a simple nature, which is simple
\[uncompounded\] in the truest sense, to be either understood or
believed, which in its extent and sublimity far surpasses the nature of
our minds. For there is mutability in our mind, which comes by learning
to the perception of what it was previously ignorant of, and loses by
unlearning what it formerly knew; and is deceived by what has a
similarity to truth, so as to approve of the false in place of the true,
and is hindered by its own obscurity as by a kind of darkness from
arriving at the truth. And so that substance is not in the truest sense
simple, to which being is not identical with knowing; for it can exist
without the possession of knowledge. But it cannot be so with that
divine substance, for it is what it has. And on this account it has not
knowledge in any such way as that the knowledge whereby it knows should
be to it one thing, and the essence whereby it exists another; but both
are one. Nor ought that to be called both, which is simply one. “As the
Father hath life in Himself,” and He Himself is not something different
from the life that is in Him; “so hath He given to the Son to have life
in Himself,”  <span id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md) that is, hath
begotten the Son, that He also should Himself be the life. Accordingly
we ought to accept what is said of the Holy Spirit, “For he shall not
speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak,” in
such a way as to understand thereby that He is not of Himself. Because
it is the Father only who is not of another. For the Son is born of the
Father, and the Holy Spirit proceedeth from the Father; but the Father
is neither born of, nor proceedeth from, another. And yet surely there
should not on that account occur to human thought any idea of disparity
in the supreme Trinity; for both the Son is equal to Him of whom He is
born, and the Holy Spirit to Him from whom He proceedeth. But what
difference there is in such a case between proceeding and being born,
would be too lengthy to make the subject of inquiry and dissertation,
and would make our definition liable to the charge of rashness, even
after we had discussed it; for such a thing is of the utmost difficulty,
both for the mind to comprehend in any adequate way, and even were it so
that the mind has attained to any such comprehension, for the tongue to
explain, however able the one that presides as a teacher, or he that is
present as a hearer. Accordingly, “He shall not speak of Himself;”
because He is not of Himself. <span id="page_383">p. 383</span> <span
id="iii.c-Page_383"></span>“But whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He
speak:” He shall hear of Him from whom He proceedeth. To Him hearing is
knowing; but knowing is being, as has been discussed above. Because,
then, He is not of Himself, but of Him from whom He proceedeth, and of
whom He has essence, of Him He has knowledge; from Him, therefore, He
has hearing, which is nothing else than knowledge.

<span id="iii.c-p29"></span>5. And be not disturbed by the fact that the
verb is put in the future tense. For it is not said, whatsoever He hath
heard, or, whatsoever He heareth; but, “whatsoever He shall hear, that
shall He speak.” For such hearing is everlasting, because the knowing is
everlasting. But in the case of what is eternal, without beginning and
without end, in whatever tense the verb is put, whether in the past, or
present, or future, there is no falsehood thereby implied. For although
to that immutable and ineffable nature, there is no proper application
of Was and Will be, but only Is: for that nature alone *is* in truth,
because incapable of change; and to it therefore was it exclusively
suited to say, “I Am That I Am,” and “Thou shalt say unto the children
of Israel, He Who Is hath sent me unto you:” <span
id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) yet on account of the
changeableness of the times amid which our mortal and changeable life is
spent, there is nothing false in our saying, both it was, and will be,
and is. It was in past, it is in present, it will be in future ages. It
was, because it never was wanting; it will be, because it will never be
wanting; it is, because it always is. For it has not, like one who no
longer survives, died with the past; nor, like one who abideth not, is
it gliding away with the present; nor, as one who had no previous
existence, will it rise up with the future. Accordingly, as our human
manner of speaking varies with the revolutions of time, He, who through
all times was not, is not, and will not by any possibility be found
wanting, may correctly bespoken of in any tense whatever of a verb. The
Holy Spirit, therefore, is always hearing, because He always knows:
*ergo*, He both knew, and knows, and will know; and in the same way He
both heard, and hears, and will hear; for, as we have already said, to
Him hearing is one with knowing, and knowing with Him is one with being.
From Him, therefore, He heard, and hears, and will hear, of whom He is;
and of Him He is, from whom He proceeds.

<span id="iii.c-p31"></span>6. Some one may here inquire whether the
Holy Spirit proceedeth also from the Son. For the Son is Son of the
Father alone, and the Father is Father of the Son alone; but the Holy
Spirit is not the Spirit of one of them, but of both. You have the Lord
Himself saying, “For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your
Father that speaketh in you;” <span id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md)
and you have the apostle, “God hath sent forth the spirit of His Son
into your hearts.” <span id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) Are there,
then, two, the one of the Father, the other of the Son? Certainly not.
For there is “one body,” he said, when referring to the Church; and
presently added, “and one Spirit.” And mark how he there makes up the
Trinity. “As ye are called,” he says, “in one hope of your calling.”
“One Lord,” where he certainly meant Christ to be understood; but it
remained that he should also name the Father: and accordingly there
follows, “One faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is
above all, and through all, and in you all.” <span
id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md) And since, then, just as there is
one Father, and one Lord, namely, the Son, so also there is one Spirit;
He is doubtless of both: especially as Christ Jesus Himself saith, “The
Spirit of your Father that dwelleth in you;” and the apostle declares,
“God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts.” You have
the same apostle saying in another place, “But if the Spirit of Him that
raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you,” where he certainly intended
the Spirit of the Father to be understood; of whom, however, he says in
another place, “But if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none
of His.” <span id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md) And many other
testimonies there are, which plainly show that He, who in the Trinity is
styled the Holy Spirit, is the Spirit both of the Father and of the Son.

<span id="iii.c-p36"></span>7. And for no other reason, I suppose, is He
called in a peculiar way the Spirit; since though asked concerning each
person in His turn, we cannot but admit that the Father and the Son are
each of them a Spirit; for God is a Spirit, <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) that is, God is not carnal, but
spiritual. By the name, therefore, which they each also hold in common,
it was requisite that He should be distinctly called, who is not the one
nor the other of them, but in whom what is common to both becomes
apparent. Why, then, should we not believe that the Holy Spirit
proceedeth also from the Son, seeing that He is likewise the Spirit of
the Son? For did He not so proceed, He could not, when showing Himself
to His disciples after the resurrection, have breathed upon them, and
said, “Receive ye the Holy Spirit.” <span
id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641.md) For what else was signified by
<span id="page_384">p. 384</span> <span id="iii.c-Page_384"></span>such
a breathing upon them, but that from Him also the Holy Spirit
proceedeth? And of the same character also are His words regarding the
woman that suffered from the bloody flux: “Some one hath touched me; for
I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.” <span
id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642.md) For that the Holy Spirit is also
designated by the name of virtue, is both clear from the passage where
the angel, in reply to Mary’s question, “How shall this be, seeing I
know not a man?” said, “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
power \[virtue\] of the highest shall overshadow thee;” <span
id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643.md) and our Lord Himself when giving
His disciples the promise of the Spirit, said, “But tarry ye in the
city, until ye be endued with power \[virtue\] from on high;” <span
id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644.md) and on another occasion, “Ye shall
receive the power \[virtue\] of the Holy Ghost coming upon you, and ye
shall be witnesses unto me.” <span id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645.md)
It is of this virtue that we are to believe, that the evangelist says,
“Virtue went out of Him, and healed them all.” <span
id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646.md)

<span id="iii.c-p44"></span>8. If, then, the Holy Spirit proceedeth both
from the Father and from the Son, why said the Son, “He proceedeth from
the Father”? <span id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647.md) Why, do you
think, but just because it is to Him He is wont to attribute even that
which is His own, of whom He Himself also is? Hence we have Him saying,
“My doctrine is not mine, but His that sent me.” <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648.md) If, therefore, in such a passage we
are to understand that as His doctrine, which nevertheless He declared
not to be His own, but the Father’s, how much more in that other passage
are we to understand the Holy Spirit as proceeding from Himself, where
His words, “He proceedeth from the Father,” were uttered so as not to
imply, He proceedeth not from me? But from Him, of whom the Son has it
that He is God (for He is God of God), He certainly has it that from Him
also the Holy Spirit proceedeth: and in this way the Holy Spirit has it
of the Father Himself, that He should also proceed from the Son, even as
He proceedeth from the Father.

<span id="iii.c-p47"></span>9. In connection with this, we come also to
some understanding of the further point, that is, so far as it can be
understood by such beings as ourselves, why the Holy Spirit is not said
to be born, but to proceed: since, if He also were called by the name of
Son, He could not avoid being called the Son of both, which is utterly
absurd. For no one is a son of two, unless of a father and mother. But
it would be utterly abhorrent to entertain the suspicion of any such
intervention between God the Father and God the Son. For not even a son
of human parents proceedeth at the same time from father and from
mother: but at the time that he proceedeth from the father into the
mother, it is not then that he proceedeth from the mother; and when he
cometh forth from the mother into the light of day, it is not then that
he proceedeth from the father. But the Holy Spirit proceedeth not from
the Father into the Son, and then proceedeth from the Son to the work of
the creature’s sanctification; but He proceedeth at the same time from
both: although this the Father hath given unto the Son, that He should
proceed from Him also, even as He proceedeth from Himself. And as little
can we say that the Holy Spirit is not the life, seeing that the Father
is the life, and the Son is the life. And in the same way as the Father,
who hath life in Himself, hath given to the Son also to have life in
Himself; so hath He also given that life should proceed from Him, even
as it also proceedeth from Himself. <span
id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649.md) But we come now to the words of our
Lord that follow, when He saith: “And He will show you things to come.
He shall glorify me; for He shall receive of mine, and shall show it
unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore, said I,
that He shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you.” But as the
present discourse has already been protracted to some length, they must
be left over for another.
