<span id="iii.xcii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.xcii-p1.1"></span>Tractate XCI.</span>

<span id="iii.xcii-p2"></span><span id="iii.xcii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.xcii-p2.2"></span>Chapter XV. 24, 25</span>.

<span id="iii.xcii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.xcii-p3.1"></span>The</span> Lord had said, “He that hateth me,
hateth my Father also.” For of a certainty he that hateth the truth must
also hate Him of whom the truth is born; on which subject we have
already spoken, as we were granted ability. And then He added the words
on which we have now to discourse: “If I had not done among \[in\] them
the works which none other man did, they had not had sin.” To wit, that
great sin whereof He also says before, “If I had not come and spoken
unto them, they had not had sin.” Their sin was that of not believing on
Him who thus spake and wrought. For they were not without sin before He
so spake to them and did such works among them; but this sin of theirs,
in not believing on Him, is thus specially mentioned because really
inclusive in itself of all sins besides. For had they been clear of this
one, and believed on Him, all else would also have been forgiven.

<span id="iii.xcii-p4"></span>2. But what is meant when, after saying,
“If I had not done among them works,” He immediately added, “which none
other man did”? Of a certainty, among all the works of Christ, none seem
to be greater than the raising of the dead; and yet we know that the
same was done by the prophets of olden time. For Elias did so; <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480.md) and Elisha also, both when alive in
the flesh, <span id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481.md) and when he lay
buried in his sepulchre. For when certain men, who were carrying a dead
person, had fled thither for refuge from an onset of their enemies, and
had laid him down therein, he instantly came again to life. <span
id="fr_1482"></span>[1483](#fn_1482.md) And yet there were some works that
Christ did which none other man did: as, when He fed the five thousand
men with five loaves, and the four thousand with seven; <span
id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483.md) when He walked on the waters, and
gave Peter power to do the same; <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484.md) when He changed the water into
wine; <span id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485.md) when He opened the eyes
of a man that was born blind, <span id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md)
and many besides, which it would take long to mention. But we are
answered, that others also have done works which even He did not, and
which no other man has done. For who else save Moses smote the Egyptians
with so many and mighty plagues, <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487.md) as when He led the people through
the parted waters of the sea, <span id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488.md)
when he obtained manna for them from heaven in their hunger, <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md) and water from the rock in their
thirst? <span id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) Who else save Joshua
the son of Nun <span id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) divided the
stream of the Jordan for the people to pass over, <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) and by the utterance of a prayer to
God bridled and stopped the revolving sun? <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) Who save Samson ever quenched his
thirst with water flowing forth from the jawbone of a dead ass? <span
id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) Who save Elias was carried aloft in
a chariot of fire? <span id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md) Who save
Elisha, as I have just mentioned, after his own body was buried,
restored the dead body of another to life? Who else besides Daniel lived
unhurt amid the jaws of famishing lions, that were shut up with
him? <span id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md) And who else save the
three men Ananias, Azariah, and Mishael, ever walked about unharmed in
flames that blazed and did not burn? <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md)

<span id="iii.xcii-p23"></span>3. I pass by other examples, as these I
consider to be sufficient to show that some of the saints have done
wonderful works, which none other man did. But we read of no one
whatever of the ancients who cured with such power so many bodily
defects, and bad states of the health, and troubles of mortals. For, to
say nothing of those individual cases which He healed, as they occurred,
by the word of command, the Evangelist Mark says in a certain place:
“And at even, when the sun had set, they brought unto Him all that were
diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. And all the city was
gathered together at the door. And He healed many that were sick of
divers diseases, and cast out many devils.” <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md) And Matthew, in giving us the same
account, has also added the prophetic testimony, when he says: “That it
might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sickness.” <span
id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md) In another passage also it is said
by Mark: “And whithersoever He entered, into villages, or cities, or
country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought Him that they
might touch if it were but the border of His garment: and as many as
touched Him were made whole.” <span id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md)
None other man did such things *in* them. For so are we to understand
the words *in them*, not <span id="page_362">p. 362</span> <span
id="iii.xcii-Page_362"></span>among them, or in their presence; but
directly *in them*, because He healed them. For He wished them to
understand the works as those which not only occasioned admiration, but
conferred also manifest healing, and were benefits which they ought
surely to have requited with love, and not with hatred. He transcends,
indeed, the miracles of all besides, in being born of a virgin, and in
possessing alone the power, both in His conception and birth, to
preserve inviolate the integrity of His mother: but that was done
neither before their eyes nor in them. For the knowledge of the truth of
such a miracle was reached by the apostles, not through any onlooking
that they had in common with others, but in the course of their separate
discipleship. Moreover, the fact that on the third day He restored
Himself to life from the very tomb, in the flesh wherein He had been
slain, and, never thereafter to die, with it ascended into heaven, even
surpasses all else that He did: but just as little was this done either
in the Jews or before their eyes; nor had it yet been done, when He
said, “If I had not done among them the works which none other man did.”

<span id="iii.xcii-p27"></span>4. The works, then, are doubtless those
miracles of healing in connection with their bodily complaints which He
exhibited to such an extent as no one before had furnished amongst them:
for these they saw, and it is in reproaching them therewith that He
proceeds to say, “But now have they both seen and hated both me and my
Father: but \[this cometh to pass\] that the word might be fulfilled
that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause
\[gratuitously\].” He calls it, their law, not as invented by them, but
given to them: just as we say, “Our daily bread;” which, nevertheless,
we ask of God in conjoining the words “Give us.” <span
id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md) But one hates gratuitously who
neither seeks advantage from the hatred nor avoids inconvenience: so do
the wicked hate the Lord; and so also is He loved by the righteous, that
is to say, gratuitously \[gratis, freely,\] inasmuch as they expect no
other gifts beyond Himself, for He Himself will be all in all. But
whoever would be disposed to look for something more profound in the
words of Christ, “If I had not done among them the works which none
other man did” (for although such were done by the Father, or the Holy
Spirit, yet no one else did them, for the whole Trinity is one and the
same in substance), he will find that it was He who did it even when
some man of God did something similar. For in Himself He can do
everything by Himself; but without Him no one can do anything. For
Christ with the Father and the Holy Spirit are not three Gods, but one
God, of whom it is written, “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who only
doeth wondrous things.”  <span id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502.md) No
one else, therefore, really himself did the works which He did amongst
them; for any one else who did any such works, did them only through His
doing. But He Himself did them without any doing on their part.
