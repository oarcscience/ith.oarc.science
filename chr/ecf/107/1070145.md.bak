<span id="iv.xvii"></span>

<span id="iv.xvii-p1"></span> *Contra Maximinum. lib. ii. c. 14, § 2,
3.*

<span id="iv.xvii-p2"></span>[1 John
5.20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.xvii-p2.1"></span>*.
“Ut simus in vero Filio ejus Jesu Christo; ipse est verus Deus et vita
æterna*.” <span id="fr_2561"></span>[2562](#fn_2561.md)

<span id="iv.xvii-p4"></span>When ye read, “That we may be in His true
Son Jesus Christ,” think of the “true Son” of God. But this Son ye in no
wise think to be the true Son of God, if ye deny Him to be begotten of
the substance of the Father. For was He already Son of Man and by gift
of God became Son of God, begotten indeed of God, but by grace, not by
nature? Or, though not Son of Man, yet was He some sort of creature
which, by God’s changing it, was converted into Son of God? If you mean
nothing of this sort, then was He either begotten of nothing, or of some
substance. But thou hast relieved us from all fear of having to suppose
that you affirm the Son of God to be of nothing, for thou hast declared
that this is not your meaning. Therefore, He is of some substance. If
not of the substance of the Father, then of what? Tell me. But ye cannot
find any other . . . Consequently, the Father and the Son are of one and
the same substance. This is the *Homöusion* . . . . In the Scriptures
both you and <span id="page_529">p. 529</span> <span
id="iv.xvii-Page_529"></span>we read, “That we may be in His true Son
Jesus Christ; He is the true God and Eternal Life.” Let both parties
yield to such weighty evidence. Tell us then, whether this “true Son” of
God, discriminated as He is by the property of this name from those who
are sons by grace, <span id="fr_2562"></span>[2563](#fn_2562.md) be of no
substance or of some substance. Thou sayest, “I do not say that He is of
no substance, lest I should say that He is of nothing.” He is therefore
of some substance: I ask, of what? If not of the substance of the
Father, seek another. If thou findest not another, as indeed thou canst
find none at all, then acknowledge it to be the Father’s, and confess
the Son *Homöusios*, “of one substance with the Father.” Flesh is
begotten of flesh, the Son of flesh is begotten of the substance of the
flesh. Set aside corruption, reject from the eye of the mind all carnal
passions, and behold “the invisible things of God understood by the
means of the things that are made.” <span
id="fr_2563"></span>[2564](#fn_2563.md) Believe that the Creator who hath
given flesh power to beget flesh, who hath given parents power of the
substance of the flesh to generate “true sons” of flesh, much more had
power to beget a “true Son” of His own substance, and to have one
substance with the true Son, the spiritual incorruption remaining and
carnal corruption being altogether alien therefrom. <span

<span id="iv.xvii-p3"></span> St. Hilary *de Trin.* vi. 43, cites the
passage with additions, of which there are no traces in the <span
class="c10"><span id="iv.xvii-p3.1"></span>mss.</span> and other
authorities; *Quia scimus quod Filius Dei venit et concarnatus est
propter nos, et, passus est, et resurgens de mortuis assumpsit nos, et
dedit nobis intellectum optimum, ut intelligamus verum, et simus in vero
filio ejus Jesu Christo: hic est verus \[Deus om.\], et vita æterna, et
resurrectio nostra*: and it is remarkable that his contemporary
Faustinus (the Luciferian) in his work *de Trinitate*, gives the passage
*totidem verbis*, except that it is doubtful whether he read *verus
Deus*, and that after *resurrectio nostra* he adds *in ipso*.—Vulg. *et
simus in vero Filio ejus. Hic est verus Deus, et vita æterna*. In the
Greek the second <span class="Greek"><span id="iv.xvii-p3.2"></span>ἐν
τῷ</span> is omitted by St Cyril, Alex. St. Basil, *adv. Eunom.* and
others; and this is the received reading of the Latins.—There is no
certain evidence to show how the text was interpreted by the ante-Nicene
Fathers. St. Athanasius *Orat. c. Arian.* iii. 24, sec. 4; 25, sec. 16;
iv. 9, *init*. and St. Basil *adv. Eunom.* iv. p. 294, unhesitatingly
refer the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xvii-p3.3"></span>οὗτος</span> to the nearest antecedent: “And we
are in Him the True,” (even) “in His Son Jesus Christ: this” (Jesus
Christ) “is the True God and eternal Life:” and the Latin Fathers from
St. Hilary and St. Ambrose downward allege the text as an explicit
declaration of the true Godhead of the Son.—St. Epiphanius *Ancorat* c.
4, seems to have read in his copy, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xvii-p3.4"></span>οὗτος ἐστιν ὁ ἀληθινὸς καὶ ζωὴ αἰώνιός</span>,
omitting <span class="Greek"><span id="iv.xvii-p3.5"></span> Θεὸς</span>
(as Hilary): for he says: “And though the epithet ‘Very God’ (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.xvii-p3.6"></span>θεὸς ἀληθινὸς</span>) is
not added,” *i.e.* though this <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xvii-p3.7"></span>οὗτος</span>, meaning Jesus Christ, is not
expressly called the true God (as in v. 20, where he seems to have had
in his copy the reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xvii-p3.8"></span>ἀληθινὸν Θεόν</span>), “we do but accumulate
madness if we dare to blaspheme and to say that the Son is not Very God.
For it is enough that in the One \[who is so called\] we take in the
whole Trinity, and from the Father \[as Very God\] understand the Son
also to be Very God.”

id="iv.xvii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xvii-p5"></span> Serm. cxl. 3 “Seek in the Epistle of this
same John what he hath said of Christ. ‘Believe’ (*credamus*) saith he,
‘on His true Son Jesus Christ, He is the True God and Eternal Life!’
What meaneth, ‘True God and Eternal Life?’ The ‘True Son’ of God is ‘the
True God and Eternal Life.’ Why has he said, ‘On His True Son?’ Because
God hath many sons, therefore He was to be distinguished by adding that
He was the ‘True Son.’ Not just by saying that He is the Son, but by
adding, as I said, that He is the ‘True Son’: He was to be distinguished
because of the many sons whom God hath. For we are sons by grace, He by
Nature. We, made such by the Father through Him; He, what the Father is,
Himself is also: what God is, are we also?”
