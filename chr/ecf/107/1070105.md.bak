<span id="iii.ciii-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.ciii-p1.1"></span>Tractate CII.</span>

<span id="iii.ciii-p2"></span><span id="iii.ciii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.ciii-p2.2"></span>Chapter XVI. 23–28</span>.

<span id="iii.ciii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.ciii-p3.1"></span>We</span> have now to consider these words of
the Lord, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, If ye shall ask anything of
the Father in my name, He will give it you.” It has already been said in
the earlier portions of this discourse of our Lord’s, on account of
those who ask some things of the Father in Christ’s name and receive
them not, that there is nothing asked of the Father in the Saviour’s
name that is asked in contrariety to the method of salvation. <span
id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675.md) For it is not the sound of the
letters and syllables, but what the sound itself imports, and what is
rightly and truly to be understood by that sound, that He is to be
regarded as declaring, when He says, “in my name.” Hence, he who has
such ideas of Christ as ought not to be entertained of the only Son of
God, asketh not in His name, even though he may not abstain from the
mention of Christ in so many letters and syllables; since it is only in
His name he asketh, of whom he is thinking when he asketh. But he who
has such ideas of Him as ought to be entertained, asketh in His name,
and receiveth what he asketh, if he asketh nothing that is contrary to
his own everlasting salvation. And he receiveth it when he ought to
receive it. For some things are not refused, but are delayed till they
can be given at a suitable time. In this way, surely, we are to
understand His words, “He will give you,” so that thereby we may know
that those benefits are signified which are properly applicable to those
who ask. For all the saints are heard effectively <span
id="fr_1676"></span>[1677](#fn_1676.md) in their own behalf, but are not so
heard in behalf of all besides, whether friends or enemies, or any
others: for it is not said in a general kind of way, “He will give;”
but, “He will give you.”

<span id="iii.ciii-p6"></span>2. “Hitherto,” He says, “ye have not asked
anything in my name. Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be
full.” This that He calls a full joy is certainly no carnal joy, but a
spiritual one; and when it shall be so great as to be no longer capable
of any additions to it, it will then doubtless be full. Whatever, then,
is asked as belonging to the attainment of this joy, is to be asked in
the name of Christ, if we understand the grace of God, and if we are
truly in quest of a blessed life. But if aught different from this is
asked, there is nothing asked: not that the thing itself is nothing at
all, but that in comparison with what is so great, anything else that is
coveted is virtually nothing. <span id="page_390">p. 390</span> <span
id="iii.ciii-Page_390"></span>For, of course, the man is not actually
nothing, of whom the apostle says, “He who thinketh himself to be
something, when he is nothing.” <span
id="fr_1677"></span>[1678](#fn_1677.md) But surely in comparison with the
spiritual man, who knows that by the grace of God he is what he is, he
who makes vain assumptions is nothing. In this way, then, may the words
also be rightly understood, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, if ye shall
ask anything of the Father in my name, He will give \[it\] you;” that by
the words, “if anything,” should not be understood anything whatever,
but anything that is not really nothing in connection with the life of
blessedness. And what follows, “Hitherto ye have not asked anything in
my name,” may be understood in two ways: either, that ye have not asked
in my name, because a name that ye have not known as it is yet to be
known; or, ye have not asked anything, since in comparison with that
which ye ought to have asked, what ye have asked is to be accounted as
nothing. In order, then, that, they may ask in His name, not that which
is nothing, but a full joy (since anything different from this that they
ask is virtually nothing), He addresses to them the exhortation, “Ask,
and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full;” that is, ask this in
my name, that your joy may be full, and ye shall receive. For His
saints, who persevere in asking such a good thing as this, will in no
wise be defrauded by the mercy of God.

<span id="iii.ciii-p8"></span>3. “These things,” said He, “have I spoken
to you in proverbs: but the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto
you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of my Father.” I might be
disposed to say that this hour, whereof He speaketh, must be understood
as that future period when we shall see openly, as the blessed Paul
says, “face to face;” that what He says, “These things have I spoken to
you in proverbs,” is one with what has been said by the same apostle,
“Now we see through a glass, in a riddle:” <span
id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678.md) and “I will show you,” because the
Father shall be seen through the instrumentality of the Son, is akin to
what He says elsewhere, “Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the
Son, and \[he\] to whom the Son shall be pleased to reveal Him.” <span
id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679.md) But such a sense seems to be
interfered with by that which follows: “At that day ye shall ask in my
name.” For in that future world, when we have reached the kingdom where
we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is, <span
id="fr_1680"></span>[1681](#fn_1680.md) what shall we then have to ask,
when our desire shall be satisfied with good things? <span
id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681.md) As it is also said in another
psalm: “I shall be satisfied when Thy glory shall be revealed.” <span
id="fr_1682"></span>[1683](#fn_1682.md) For petition has to do with some
kind of want, which can have no place there where such abundance shall
reign.

<span id="iii.ciii-p14"></span>4. It remains, therefore, for us, so far
as my capacity to apprehend it goes, to understand Jesus as having
promised that He would cause His disciples, from being carnal and
natural, to become spiritual, although not yet such as we shall be, when
a spiritual body shall also be ours; but such as was he who said, “We
speak wisdom among them that are perfect;” <span
id="fr_1683"></span>[1684](#fn_1683.md) and, “I could not speak unto you as
unto spiritual, but as unto carnal;” <span
id="fr_1684"></span>[1685](#fn_1684.md) and, “We have received, not the
spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is of God; that we might know
the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we
speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the
Spirit teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the
natural <span id="fr_1685"></span>[1686](#fn_1685.md) man perceiveth not
the things of the Spirit of God.” And thus the natural man, perceiving
not the things of the Spirit of God, hears in such a way whatever is
told him of the nature of God, that he can conceive of nothing else but
some bodily form, however spacious or immense, however lustrous and
magnificent, yet still a body: and therefore he holds as proverbs all
that is said of the incorporeal and immutable substance of wisdom; not
that he accounts them as proverbs, but that his thoughts follow the same
direction as those who habitually listen to proverbs without
understanding them. But when the spiritual man begins to discern all
things, and he himself is discerned by no man, he perceives, even though
in this life it still be through a glass and in part, not by any bodily
sense, and not by any imaginative conception which catches at or devises
the likenesses of all sorts of bodies, but by the clearest understanding
of the mind, that God is not material, but spiritual: in such a way does
the Son show us openly of the Father, that He, who thus shows, is also
Himself seen to be of the same substance. And then it is that those who
ask, ask in His name; for in the sound of that name they understand
<span id="page_391">p. 391</span> <span
id="iii.ciii-Page_391"></span>nothing else than what the reality is that
is called by that name, and harbor not, in vanity or infirmity of mind,
the fiction of the Father being in one place, and the Son in another,
standing before the Father and making request in our behalf, with the
material substances of both occupying each its own place, and the Word
pleading verbally for us with Him whose Word He is, while a definite
space interposes between the mouth of the speaker and the ears of the
hearer; and other such absurdities which those who are natural, and at
the same time carnal, fabricate for themselves in their hearts. For any
such thing, suggested by the experience of bodily habits, as occurs to
spiritual men when thinking of God, they deny and reject, and drive
away, like troublesome insects, from the eyes of their mind; and resign
themselves to the purity of that light by whose testimony and judgment
they prove these bodily images that thrust themselves on their inward
vision to be altogether false. These are able to a certain extent to
think of our Lord Jesus Christ, in respect of His manhood, as addressing
the Father on our behalf; but in respect to His Godhead, as hearing
\[and answering\] us along with the Father. And this I am of opinion
that He indicated, when He said, “And I say not that I will pray the
Father for you.” But the intuitive perception of this, how it is that
the Son asketh not the Father, but that Father and Son alike listen to
those who ask, is a height that can be reached only by the spiritual eye
of the mind.

<span id="iii.ciii-p18"></span>5. “For the Father Himself,” He says,
“loveth you, because ye have loved me.” Is it the case, then, that He
loveth, because we love; or rather, that we love, because He loveth? Let
this same evangelist give us the answer out of his own epistle: “We love
Him,” he says, “because He first loved us.” <span
id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686.md) This, then, was the efficient cause
of our loving, that we were loved. And certainly to love God is the gift
of God. He it was that gave the grace to love Him, who loved while still
unloved. Even when displeasing Him we were loved, that there might be
that in us whereby we should become pleasing in His sight. For we could
not love the Son unless we loved the Father also. The Father loveth us,
because we love the Son; seeing it is of the Father and Son we have
received \[the power\] to love both the Father and the Son: for love is
shed abroad in our hearts by the Spirit of both, <span
id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687.md) by which Spirit we love both the
Father and the Son, and whom we love along with the Father and the Son.
God, therefore, it was that wrought this religious love of ours whereby
we worship God; and He saw that it is good, and on that account He
Himself loved that which He had made. But He would not have wrought in
us something He could love, were it not that He loved ourselves before
He wrought it.

<span id="iii.ciii-p21"></span>6. “And ye have believed,” He adds, “that
I came out from God. I came forth from the Father, and am come into the
world: again I leave the world, and go to the Father.” Clearly we have
believed. For surely it ought not to be accounted a thing incredible
because of this, that in coming to the world He came forth in such a
sense from the Father that He did not leave the Father behind; and that,
on leaving the world, He goes to the Father in such a sense that He does
not actually forsake the world. For He came forth from the Father
because He is of the Father; and He came into the world, in showing to
the world His bodily form, which He had received of the Virgin. He left
the world by a bodily withdrawal, He proceeded to the Father by His
ascension as man, but He forsook not the world in the ruling activity of
His presence.

So the Septuagint translate <span class="Hebrew"><span
id="iii.ciii-p13.2"></span>אֶשְׂבְּעָה בְהָקִיץ תְּמוּנָתֶךָ</span>. The
*Hiphil* intransitive form <span class="Hebrew"><span

“awaking” out of sleep, not of “appearing,” or “being manifested;” and
<span class="Hebrew"><span id="iii.ciii-p13.4"></span>תְּמוּנָה</span>
properly means, *appearance, form, likeness*, although “*glory*” may in
the present connection be implied: so that while the rendering of the
Septuagint may be grammatically defensible, “I shall be satisfied when
Thy glory is manifested,” yet the strict meaning of the words, the
