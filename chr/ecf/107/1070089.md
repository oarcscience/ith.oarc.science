<span id="iii.lxxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.lxxxvii-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXXXVI.</span>

<span id="iii.lxxxvii-p2"></span><span
id="iii.lxxxvii-p2.1"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxxxvii-p2.2"></span>Chapter XV. 15, 16</span>.

<span id="iii.lxxxvii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxxxvii-p3.1"></span>It</span> is a worthy subject of inquiry
how these words of the Lord are to be understood, “But I have called you
friends: for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known
unto you.” For who is there that dare affirm or believe that any man
knoweth all things that the only-begotten Son hath heard of the Father;
when there is no one that can comprehend even how He heareth any word of
the Father, being as He is Himself the only Word of the Father? Nay
more, is it not the case that a little afterwards, in this same
discourse, which He delivered to the disciples between the Supper and
His passion, He said, “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye
cannot bear them now”? <span id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md) How,
then, are we to understand that He made known unto the disciples all
that He had heard of the Father, when there are many things that He
saith not, just because He knows that they cannot bear them now?
Doubtless what He is yet to do He says that He has done as the same
Being who hath made those things which are yet to be. <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) For as He says by the prophet,
“They pierced my hands and my feet,” <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) and not, They will yet pierce; but
<span id="page_353">p. 353</span> <span
id="iii.lxxxvii-Page_353"></span>speaking as it were of the past, and
yet predicting what was still in the future: so also in the passage
before us He declares that He has made known to the disciples all, that
He knows He will yet make known in that fullness of knowledge, whereof
the apostle says, “But when that which is perfect is come, then that
which is in part shall be done away.” For in the same place he adds:
“Now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as also I am known; and
now through a glass in a riddle, but then face to face.” <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) For the same apostle also says that
we have been saved by the washing of regeneration, <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438.md) and yet declares in another place,
“We are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is no hope; for what a man
seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not,
then do we with patience wait for it.” <span
id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439.md) To a similar purpose it is also
said by his fellow-apostle Peter, “In whom, though now seeing Him not,
ye believe; and in whom, when ye see Him, ye shall rejoice with a joy
unspeakable and glorious: receiving the reward of faith, even the
salvation of your souls.” <span id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440.md) If,
then, it is now the season of faith, and faith’s reward is the salvation
of our souls; who, in that faith which worketh by love, <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441.md) can doubt that the day must come to
an end, and at its close the reward be received; not only the redemption
of our body, whereof the Apostle Paul speaketh, <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) but also the salvation of our
souls, as we are told by the Apostle Peter? For the felicity springing
from both is at this present time, and in the existing state of
mortality, a matter rather of hope than of actual possession. But this
it concerns us to remember, that our outward man, to wit the body, is
still decaying; but the inward, that is, the soul, is being renewed day
by day. <span id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md) Accordingly, while we
are waiting for the immortality of the flesh and salvation of our souls
in the future, yet with the pledge we have received, it may be said that
we are saved already; so that knowledge of all things which the
Only-begotten hath heard of the Father we are to regard as a matter of
hope still lying in the future, although declared by Christ as something
He had already imparted.

<span id="iii.lxxxvii-p14"></span>2. “Ye have not chosen me,” He says,
“but I have chosen you.” Grace such as that is ineffable. For what were
we so long as Christ had not yet chosen us, and we were therefore still
destitute of love? For he who hath chosen Him, how can he love Him? Were
we, think you, in that condition which is sung of in the psalm: “I had
rather be an abject in the house of the Lord, than dwell in the tents of
wickedness”? <span id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md) Certainly not.
What were we then, but sinful and lost? We had not yet come to believe
on Him, in order to lead to His choosing us; for if it were those who
already believed that He chose, then was He chosen Himself, prior to His
choosing. But how could He say, “Ye have not chosen me,” save only
because His mercy anticipated us? <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) Here surely is at fault the vain
reasoning of those who defend the foreknowledge of God in opposition to
His grace, and with this view declare that we were chosen before the
foundation of the world, <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md)
because God foreknew that we should be good, but not that He Himself
would make us good. So says not He, who declares, “Ye have not chosen
me.” For had He chosen us on the ground that He foreknew that we should
be good, then would He also have foreknown that we would not be the
first to make choice of Him. For in no other way could we possibly be
good: unless, forsooth, one could be called good who has never made good
his choice. What was it then that He chose in those who were not good?
For they were not chosen because of their goodness, inasmuch as they
could not be good without being chosen. Otherwise grace is no more
grace, if we maintain the priority of merit. Such, certainly, is the
election of grace, whereof the apostle says: “Even so then at this
present time also there is a remnant saved according to the election of
grace.” To which he adds: “And if by grace, then is it no more of works;
otherwise grace is no more grace.”  <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md) Listen, thou ungrateful one,
listen: “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.” Not that thou
mayest say, I am chosen because I already believed. For if thou wert
believing in Him, then hadst thou already chosen Him. But listen: “Ye
have not chosen me.” Not that thou mayest say, Before I believed I was
already doing good works, and therefore was I chosen. For what good work
can be prior to faith, when the apostle says, “Whatsoever is not of
faith is sin”?  <span id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) What, then,
are we to say on hearing such words, “Ye have not chosen me,” but that
we were evil, and were chosen in order that we might be good through the
grace of Him who chose us? For it is not by grace, if merit preceded:
but it is of grace: and therefore that grace did not find, but effected
the merit.

<span id="iii.lxxxvii-p20"></span>3. See then, beloved, how it is that
He chooseth not the good, but maketh those whom He has chosen good. “I
have chosen <span id="page_354">p. 354</span> <span
id="iii.lxxxvii-Page_354"></span>you,” He saith, “and appointed you that
ye should go and bring forth fruit, and \[that\] your fruit should
remain.” And is not that the fruit, whereof He had already said,
“Without me ye can do nothing”? <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) He hath chosen therefore, and
appointed that we should go and bring forth fruit; and no fruit,
accordingly, had we to induce His choice of us. “That ye should go,” He
said, “and bring forth fruit.” We go to bring forth, and He Himself is
the way wherein we go, and wherein He hath appointed us to go. And so
His mercy hath anticipated us in all. “And that your fruit,” He saith,
“should remain; that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name,
He may give it you.” Accordingly let love remain; for He Himself is our
fruit. And this love lies at present in longing desire, not yet in
fullness of enjoyment; and whatsoever with that longing desire we shall
ask in the name of the only-begotten Son, the Father giveth us. But what
is not expedient for our salvation to receive, let us not imagine that
we ask that in the Saviour’s name: but we ask in the name of the Saviour
only that which really belongs to the way of salvation.
