<span id="iii.lxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.lxxv-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXXIV.</span>

<span id="iii.lxxv-p2"></span><span id="iii.lxxv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lxxv-p2.2"></span>Chapter XIV. 15–17</span>.

<span id="iii.lxxv-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxxv-p3.1"></span>We</span> have heard, brethren, while the
Gospel was read, the Lord saying: “If ye love me, keep my commandments:
and I will ask the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter
\[Paraclete\], that He may abide with you for ever; \[even\] the Spirit
of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not,
neither knoweth Him: but ye shall know Him; for He shall dwell with you,
and shall be in you.”  <span id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md) There
are many points which might form the subject of inquiry in these few
words of the Lord; but it were too much for us either to search into all
that is here for the searching, or to find out all that we here search
for. Nevertheless, as far as the Lord is pleased to grant us the power,
and in proportion to our capacity and yours, attend to what we ought to
say and you to hear, and receive, beloved, what we on our part are able
to give, and apply to Him for that wherein we fail. It is the Spirit,
the Comforter, that Christ has promised to His apostles; but let us
notice the way in which He gave the promise. “If ye love me,” He says,
“keep my commandments: and I will ask the Father, and He shall give you
another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever: \[even\] the
Spirit of truth.” We have here, at all events, the Holy Spirit in the
Trinity, whom the catholic faith acknowledges to be consubstantial and
co-eternal with Father and Son: He it is of whom the apostle says, “The
love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who is
given unto us.” <span id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md) How, then,
doth the Lord say, “If ye love me, keep my commandments: and I will ask
the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter;” when He saith so
of the Holy Spirit, without \[having\] whom we can neither love God nor
keep His commandments? How can we love so as to receive Him, without
whom we cannot love at all? or how shall we keep the commandments so as
to receive Him, without whom we have no power to keep them? Or can it be
that the love wherewith we love Christ has a prior place within us, so
that, by thus loving Christ and keeping His commandments, we become
worthy of receiving the Holy Spirit, in order that the love, not of
Christ, which had already preceded, but of God the Father, may be shed
abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who is given unto us? Such a
thought is altogether wrong. For he who believes that he loveth the Son,
and loveth not the Father, certainly loveth not the Son, but some
figment of his own imagination. And besides, this is the apostolic
declaration, “No one saith, Lord Jesus, <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316.md) but in the Holy Spirit:” <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317.md) and who is it that calleth Him Lord
Jesus but he that loveth Him, if he so call Him in the way the apostle
intended to be understood? For many <span id="page_334">p. 334</span>
<span id="iii.lxxv-Page_334"></span>call Him so with their lips, but
deny Him in their hearts and works; just as He saith of such, “For they
profess that they know God, but in works they deny Him.” <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318.md) If it is by works He is denied, it
is doubtless also by works that His name is truly invoked. “No one,”
therefore, “saith, Lord Jesus,” in mind, in word, in deed, with the
heart, the lips, the labor of the hands,—no one saith, Lord Jesus, but
in the Holy Spirit; and no one calls Him so but he that loveth. And
accordingly the apostles were already calling Him Lord Jesus: and if
they called Him so, in no way that implied a feigned utterance, with the
mouth confessing, in heart and works denying Him; if they called Him so
in all truthfulness of soul, there can be no doubt they loved. And how,
then, did they love, but in the Holy Spirit? And yet they are commanded
to love Him and keep His commandments, previous and in order to their
receiving the Holy Spirit: and yet, without having that Spirit, they
certainly could not love Him and keep His commandments.

<span id="iii.lxxv-p9"></span>2. We are therefore to understand that he
who loves has already the Holy Spirit, and by what he has becomes worthy
of a fuller possession, that by having the more he may love the more.
Already, therefore, had the disciples that Holy Spirit whom the Lord
promised, for without Him they could not call Him Lord; but they had Him
not as yet in the way promised by the Lord. Accordingly they both had,
and had Him not, inasmuch as they had Him not as yet to the same extent
as He was afterwards to be possessed. They had Him, therefore, in a more
limited sense: He was yet to be given them in an ampler measure. They
had Him in a hidden way, they were yet to receive Him in a way that was
manifest; for this present possession had also a bearing on that fuller
gift of the Holy Spirit, that they might come to a conscious knowledge
of what they had. It is in speaking of this gift that the apostle says:
“Now we have received, not the spirit of this world, but the spirit
which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us
of God.” <span id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319.md) For that same
manifest bestowal of the Holy Spirit the Lord made, not once, but on two
separate occasions. For close on the back of His resurrection from the
dead He breathed on them and said, “Receive ye the Holy Spirit.” <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320.md) And because He then gave \[the
Spirit\], did He on that account fail in afterwards sending Him
according to His promise? Or was it not the very same Spirit who was
both then breathed upon them by Himself, and afterwards sent by Him from
heaven? <span id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md) And so, why that same
giving on His part which took place publicly, also took place twice, is
another question: for it may be that this twofold bestowal of His in a
public way took place because of the two Commandments of love, that is,
to our neighbor and to God, in order that love might be impressively
intimated as pertaining to the Holy Spirit. And if any other reason is
to be sought for, we cannot at present allow our discourse to be
improperly prolonged by such an inquiry: provided, however, it be
admitted that, without the Holy Spirit, we can neither love Christ nor
keep His commandments; while the less experience we have of His
presence, the less also can we do so; and the fuller our experience, so
much the greater our ability. Accordingly, the promise is no vain one,
either to him who has not \[the Holy Spirit\], or to him who has. For it
is made to him who has not, in order that he may have; and to him who
has, that he may have more abundantly. For were it not that He was
possessed by some in smaller measure than by others, St. Elisha would
not have said to St. Elijah, “Let the spirit that is in thee be in a
twofold measure in me.” <span id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md)

<span id="iii.lxxv-p14"></span>3. But when John the Baptist said, “For
God giveth not the Spirit by measure,” <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323.md) he was speaking exclusively of the
Son of God, who received not the Spirit by measure; for in Him dwelleth
all the fullness of the Godhead. <span
id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324.md) And no more is it independently of
the grace of the Holy Spirit that the Mediator between God and men is
the man Christ Jesus: <span id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325.md) for
with His own lips He tells us that the prophetical utterance had been
fulfilled in Himself: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because He
hath anointed me, and hath sent me to preach the gospel to the
poor.” <span id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326.md) For His being the
Only-begotten, the equal of the Father, is not of grace, but of nature;
but the assumption of human nature into the personal unity of the
Only-begotten is not of nature, but of grace, as the Gospel acknowledges
itself when it says, “And the child grew, and waxed strong, being filled
with wisdom, and the grace of God was in Him.” <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327.md) But to others He is given by
measure,—a measure ever enlarging until each has received his full
complement up to the limits of his own perfection. As we are also
reminded by the apostle, “Not to think of ourselves more highly than we
ought to think, but to think soberly; according as God hath dealt to
every man the measure of faith.” <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328.md) Nor is it the <span
id="page_335">p. 335</span> <span id="iii.lxxv-Page_335"></span>Spirit
Himself that is divided, but the gifts bestowed by the Spirit: for there
are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. <span
id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329.md)

<span id="iii.lxxv-p22"></span>4. But when He says, “I will ask the
Father, and He shall give you another Paraclete,” He intimates that He
Himself is also a paraclete. For paraclete is in Latin called
*advocatus* (advocate); and it is said of Christ, “We have an advocate
with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” <span
id="fr_1330"></span>[1331](#fn_1330.md) But He said that the world could
not receive the Holy Spirit, in much the same sense as it is also said,
“The minding of the flesh is enmity against God: for it is not subject
to the law of God; neither indeed can be;” <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[1332](#fn_1331.md) just as if we were to say,
Unrighteousness cannot be righteous. For in speaking in this passage of
the world, He refers to those who love the world; and such a love is not
of the Father. <span id="fr_1332"></span>[1333](#fn_1332.md) And thus the
love of this world, which gives us enough to do to weaken and destroy
its power within us, is in direct opposition to the love of God, which
is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given unto us.
“The world,” therefore, “cannot receive Him, cause it seeth Him not,
neither knoweth Him.” For worldly love possesseth not those invisible
eyes, whereby, save in an invisible way, the Holy Spirit cannot be seen.

<span id="iii.lxxv-p26"></span>5. “But ye,” He adds, “shall know Him;
for He shall dwell with you, and be in you.” He will be in them, that He
may dwell with them; He will not dwell with them to the end that He may
be in them: for the being anywhere is prior to the dwelling there. But
to prevent us from imagining that His words, “He shall dwell with you,”
were spoken in the same sense as that in which a guest usually dwells
with a man in a visible way, He explained what “He shall dwell with you”
meant, when He added the words, “He shall be in you.” He is seen,
therefore, in an invisible way: nor can we have any knowledge of Him
unless He be in us. For it is in a similar way that we come to see our
conscience within us: for we see the face of another, but we cannot see
our own; but it is our own conscience we see, not another’s. And yet
conscience is never anywhere but within us: but the Holy Spirit can be
also apart from us, since He is given that He may also be in us. But we
cannot see and know Him in the only way in which He may be seen and
known, unless He be in us.

<span id="fn_1314"></span>[333:1315](1070077.htm#fr_1314.md) <span
id="iii.lxxv-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iii.lxxv-p4"></span> Augustin has *cognoscetis* for the second
“know,” and *scit* for that immediately preceding. The Greek text,
however, has <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.lxxv-p4.1"></span>γινώσκω</span> in both places, and in the
*present* tense. He has also *manebit et in vobis erit*. The tense of
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.lxxv-p4.2"></span> μενει</span>,
whether *present* or *future*, depends simply on the place of the
accent, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.lxxv-p4.3"></span>μένει</span>, or <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.lxxv-p4.4"></span> μενεῖ</span>: while, as between the two
readings <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.lxxv-p4.5"></span>ἐστὶν</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.lxxv-p4.6"></span>žσται</span>, the preponderance of <span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lxxv-p4.7"></span>ms.</span> authority seems
in favor of the latter, although the *present* <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.lxxv-p4.8"></span> γινώσκετε</span> in the principal clause
would be more naturally followed by an equally *proleptic* present in
those which follow.—<span class="c10"><span

<span id="iii.lxxv-p6"></span> Or, “Jesus is Lord.” The weight of
authority is clearly in favor of the reading followed by Augustin—<span

’Ιησοῦς</span>, giving the direct utterance of the speaker; and not the
indirect accusative, <span class="Greek"><span
