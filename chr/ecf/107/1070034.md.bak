<span id="iii.xxxii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span

<span id="iii.xxxii-p2"></span><span id="iii.xxxii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.xxxii-p2.2"></span>Chapter VII. 25–36</span>

<span id="iii.xxxii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.xxxii-p3.1"></span>You</span> remember, beloved, in the former
discourses,—for it was both read in the Gospel and also discussed by us
according to our ability,—how that the Lord Jesus went up to the
feast-day, as it were in secret, not because He feared lest He should be
laid hold of,—He who had the power not to be laid hold of,—but to
signify that even in that very feast which was celebrated by the Jews He
Himself was hidden, and that the mystery of the feast was His own. In
the passage read to-day then, that which was supposed to be timidity
appeared as power; for He spoke openly on the feast-day, so that the
crowds marvelled, and said that which we have heard when the passage was
read: “Is not this he whom they sought to kill? And, lo, he speaketh
openly, and they say nothing. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the
Christ?” They who knew with what fierceness He was sought after,
wondered by what power He was kept from being taken. Then, not fully
understanding His power, they fancied it was the knowledge of the
rulers, that these rulers knew Him to be the very Christ, and that for
this reason they spared Him whom they had with so much eagerness sought
out to be put to death.

<span id="iii.xxxii-p4"></span>2. Then those same persons who had said,
“Did the rulers know that this is the Christ?” proposed a question among
themselves, by which it appeared to them that He was not the Christ; for
they said in addition, “But we know this man whence he is: but when
Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.” As to how this opinion
among the Jews arose, that “when Christ comes, no man knoweth whence He
is” (for it did not arise without reason), if we consider the
Scriptures, we find, brethren, that the Holy Scriptures have declared of
Christ that “He shall be called a Nazarene.” <span
id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590.md) Therefore they foretold whence He is.
Again, if we seek the place of His nativity, as that whence He is by
birth, neither was this hidden from the Jews, because of the Scriptures
which had foretold these things. For when the Magi, on the appearing of
a star, sought Him out to worship Him, they came to Herod and told him
what they sought and what they meant: and he, having called together
those who had knowledge of the law, inquired of them where Christ should
be born: they told him, “In Bethlehem of Judah,” and also brought
forward the prophetic testimony. <span id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591.md)
If, therefore, the prophets had foretold both the place where the origin
of His flesh was, and the place where His mother would bring Him forth,
whence did spring that opinion among the Jews which we have just heard,
but from this, that the Scriptures had proclaimed beforehand, and had
foretold both? In respect of His being man, the Scriptures foretold
whence He should be; in respect of His being God, this was hidden from
the ungodly, and it required godly men to discover it. Moreover, they
said this, “When Christ comes, no man knoweth whence He is,” because
that which was spoken by Isaiah produced this opinion in them, viz. “And
His generation, who shall tell?” <span id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592.md)
In short, the Lord Himself made answer to both, that they both did, and
also did not know whence He was; that He might testify to the holy
prophecy which before was predicted of Him, both as to the humanity of
infirmity and also as to the divinity of majesty.

<span id="iii.xxxii-p8"></span>3. Hear, therefore, the word of the Lord,
brethren; see how He confirmed to them both what they said, “We know
this man whence he is,” and also what they said, “When Christ cometh, no
man knoweth whence He is. Then cried Christ in the temple, saying, Ye
both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but
He that sent me is true, whom ye know not.” That is to say, ye both know
me, and ye know me not; ye both know whence I am, and ye know not whence
I am. Ye know whence I am: Jesus of Nazareth, whose parents also ye
knew. For in this case, the birth of the Virgin alone was hidden, to
whom, however, her husband was witness; for the same was able faithfully
to declare this, who was also able as a husband to be jealous.
Therefore, this birth of the Virgin excepted, they knew all that in
Jesus pertains to man: His face was known, His country was known, His
family was known; where He was born was to be known by inquiry. Rightly
then did He say, “Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am,” according
to the flesh and form of man which He bore; but according to His <span
id="page_190">p. 190</span> <span
id="iii.xxxii-Page_190"></span>divinity, “And I am not come of myself,
but He that sent me is true, whom ye know not;” but yet that ye may know
Him, believe on Him whom He has sent, and ye will know Him. For, “No man
has seen God at any time, except the only-begotten Son, who is in the
bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him:”  <span
id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593.md) and, “None knoweth the Father but the
Son, and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.” <span
id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594.md)

<span id="iii.xxxii-p11"></span>4. Lastly, when He had said, “But He
that sent me is true, whom ye know not,” in order to show them whence
they might know that which they did not know, He subjoined, “I know
Him.” Therefore seek from me to know Him. But why is it that I know Him?
“Because I am from Him, and He sent me.” Gloriously has He shown both.
“I am from Him,” said He; because the Son is from the Father, and
whatever the Son is, He is of Him whose Son He is. Hence we say that the
Lord Jesus is God of God: we do not say that the Father is God of God,
but simply God: and we say that the Lord Jesus is Light of Light; we do
not say that the Father is Light of Light, but simply Light.
Accordingly, to this belongs that which He said “I am from Him.” But as
to my being seen of you in the flesh, “He sent me.” When thou hearest
“He sent me,” do not understand a difference of nature to be meant, but
the authority of Him that begets.

<span id="iii.xxxii-p12"></span>5. “Then they sought to take Him: but no
man laid hands on Him, because His hour was not yet come;” that is,
because He was not willing. For what is this. “His hour was not yet
come”? The Lord was not born under fate. This is not to be believed
concerning thee, much less concerning Him by whom thou wast made. If thy
hour is His good will, what is His hour but His good will? He meant not
therefore an hour in which He should be forced to die, but that in which
He would deign to be put to death. But He was awaiting the time in which
He should die, for He awaited also the time in which He should be born.
The apostle, speaking of this time, says, “But when the fullness of time
came, God sent His Son.” <span id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595.md) For
this cause many say, Why did not Christ come before? To whom we must
make answer, Because the fullness of time had not yet come, while He by
whom the times were made sets their bounds; for He knew when He ought to
come. In the first place, it was necessary that He should be foretold
through a long series of times and years; for it was not something
insignificant that was to come: He who was to be ever held, had to be
for a long time foretold. The greater the judge that was coming, the
longer the train of heralds that preceded him. In short, when the
fullness of time came, He also came who was to deliver us from time. For
being delivered from time, we shall come to that eternity where there is
no time: there it is not said, When shall the hour come, for the day is
everlasting, a day which is neither preceded by a yesterday, nor cut off
by a morrow. But in this world days roll on, some are passing away,
others come; none abides; and the moments in which we are speaking drive
out one another in turn, nor stands the first syllable for the second to
sound. Since we began to speak we are somewhat older, and without doubt
I am just now older than I was in the morning; thus, nothing stands,
nothing remains fixed in time. Therefore ought we to love Him by whom
the times were made, that we may be delivered from time and be fixed in
eternity, where there is no more changeableness of times. Great,
therefore, is the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, in that for our sakes
He was made in time, by whom the times were made; that He was made among
all things, by whom all things were made; that He became what He made.
For He was made what He had made; for He was made man who had made man,
lest what He had made should perish. According to this dispensation, the
hour of His birth had now come, and He was born; but not yet had come
the hour of His suffering, therefore not yet had He suffered.

<span id="iii.xxxii-p14"></span>6. In short, that ye may know that the
words refer, not to the necessity of His dying, but to His power,—I
speak this for the sake of some who, when they hear “His hour was not
yet come,” are determined on believing in fate, and their hearts become
infatuated;—that ye may know, then, that it was His power of dying,
recollect the passion, look at Him crucified. While hanging on the tree,
He said, “I thirst.” They, having heard this, offered to Him on the
cross vinegar by a sponge on a reed. He received it, and said, “It is
finished;” and, bowing His head, gave up the ghost. You see His power of
dying, that He waited for this—until all things should be fulfilled that
had been foretold concerning Him—to take place before His death. For the
prophet had said, “They gave me gall for my meat; and in my thirst they
gave me vinegar to drink.” <span id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596.md) He
waited for all these things to be fulfilled: after they were completed,
He said, “It is finished;” <span id="page_191">p. 191</span> <span
id="iii.xxxii-Page_191"></span>and He departed by power, because He came
not by necessity. Hence some wondered more at this His power to die than
at His ability to work miracles. For they came to the cross to take the
bodies down from the tree, for the Sabbath was drawing near, and the
thieves were found still living. The punishment of the cross was so much
the harder because it tortured men so long, and all that were crucified
were killed by a lingering death. But the thieves, that they might not
remain on the tree, were forced to die by having their legs broken, that
they might be taken down thence. The Lord, however, was found to be
already dead, <span id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597.md) and the men
marvelled; and they who despised Him when living, so wondered at Him
when dead, that some of them said, “Truly this was the Son of
God.” <span id="fr_598"></span>[599](#fn_598.md) Whence also that,
brethren, where He says to those that seek Him, “I am He;” and they,
going backward, all fell to the ground? <span
id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599.md) Consequently there was in Him supreme
power. Nor was He forced to die at an hour; but He waited the hour on
which His will might fittingly be done, not that on which necessity
might be fulfilled against His will.

<span id="iii.xxxii-p19"></span>7. “But many of the people believed on
Him.” The Lord made whole the humble and the poor. The rulers were mad,
and therefore they not only did not acknowledge the Physician, but even
were eager to slay Him. There was a certain crowd of people which
quickly saw its own sickness, and without delay recognized His remedy.
See what that very crowd, moved by His miracles, said: “When Christ
cometh will He do more signs than these?” Surely, unless there will be
two Christs, this is the Christ. Consequently, in saying these things,
they believed on Him.

<span id="iii.xxxii-p20"></span>8. But those rulers, having heard the
assurance of the multitude, and that murmuring noise of the people in
which Christ was being glorified, “sent officers to take Him.” To take
whom? Him not yet willing to be taken. Because then they could not take
Him while He would not, they were sent to hear Him teaching. Teaching
what? “Then said Jesus, Yet a little while I am with you.” What ye wish
to do now ye will do, but not just now; because I am not just now
willing. Why am I now as yet unwilling? Because “yet a little while I am
with you; and then I go unto Him that sent me.” I must complete my
dispensation, and in this manner come to my suffering.

<span id="iii.xxxii-p21"></span>9. “Ye shall seek me, and shall not find
me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.” Here He has already
foretold His resurrection; for they would not acknowledge Him when
present, and afterwards they sought Him when they saw the multitude
already believing on Him. For great signs were wrought, even when the
Lord was risen again and ascended into heaven. Then mighty deeds were
done by His disciples, but He wrought by them as He wrought by Himself:
since, indeed, He had said to them, “Without me ye can do
nothing.” <span id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600.md) When that lame man who
sat at the gate rose up at Peter’s voice, and walked on his feet, so
that men marvelled, Peter spoke to them to this effect, that it was not
by his own power that he did this, but in the virtue of Him whom they
slew. <span id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601.md) Many pricked in the heart
said, “What shall we do?” For they saw themselves bound by an immense
crime of impiety, since they slew Him whom they ought to have revered
and worshipped; and this crime they thought inexpiable. A great
wickedness indeed it was, the thought of which might make them despair;
yet it did not behove them to despair, for whom the Lord, as He hung on
the cross, deigned to pray. For He had said, “Father, forgive them; for
they know not what they do.”  <span id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602.md) He
saw some who were His own among many who were aliens; for these He
sought pardon, from whom at the time He was still receiving injury. He
regarded not that He was being put to death by them, but only that He
was dying for them. It was a great thing that was forgiven them, it was
a great thing that was done by them and for them, so that no man should
despair of the forgiveness of his sin when they who slew Christ obtained
pardon. Christ died for us, but surely He was not put to death by us?
But those men indeed saw Christ dying by their own villany; and yet they
believed on Christ pardoning their villanies. Until they drank the blood
they had shed, they despaired of their own salvation. Therefore said He
this: “Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye
cannot come;” because they were to seek Him after the resurrection,
being pricked in their heart with remorse. Nor did He say “where I will
be,” but “where I am.” For Christ was always in that place whither He
was about to return; for He came in such manner that He did not depart
from that place. Hence He says in another place, “No man has ascended
into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, the Son of man who is in
heaven.” <span id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603.md) He said not, who was in
heaven. He spoke on the earth, and declared that He <span
id="page_192">p. 192</span> <span id="iii.xxxii-Page_192"></span>was at
the same time in heaven. He came in such wise that He departed not
thence; and He so returned as not to abandon us. What do ye marvel at?
This is God’s doing. For man, as regards his body, is in a place, and
departs from a place; and when he comes to another place, he will not be
in that place whence he came: but God fills all things, and is all
everywhere; He is not held in places according to space. Nevertheless
the Lord Christ was, as regards His visible flesh, on the earth: as
regards His invisible majesty, He was in heaven and on earth; and
therefore He says, “Where I am, thither ye cannot come.” Nor did He say,
“Ye shall not be able.” but “ye are not able to come;” for at that time
they were such as were not able. And that ye may know that this was not
said to cause despair, He said something of the same kind also to His
disciples: “Whither I go ye cannot come.” <span
id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604.md) Yet while praying in their behalf, He
said, “Father, I will that where I am they also may be with me.” <span
id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605.md) And, finally, this He expounded to
Peter, and says to him, “Whither I go thou canst not follow me now, but
thou shalt follow me hereafter.” <span id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606.md)

<span id="iii.xxxii-p29"></span>10. “Then said the Jews,” not to Him,
but “to themselves, Whither will this man go, that we shall not find
him? will he go unto the dispersion among the Gentiles, and teach the
Gentiles?” For they knew not what they said; but, it being His will,
they prophesied. The Lord was indeed about to go to the Gentiles, not by
His bodily presence, but still with His feet. What were His feet? Those
which Saul desired to trample upon by persecution, when the Head cried
out to him, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” <span
id="fr_607"></span>[608](#fn_607.md) What is this saying that He said, “Ye
shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot
come?” Wherefore the Lord said this they knew not, and yet they did
predict something that was to be without knowing it. For this is what
the Lord said that they knew not the place, if place however it must be
called, which is the bosom of the Father, from which Christ never
departed; nor were they competent to conceive where Christ was, whence
Christ never withdrew, whither He was to return, where He was all the
while dwelling. How was it possible for the human heart to conceive
this, least of all to explain it with the tongue? This, then, they in no
wise understood; and yet by occasion of this they foretold our
salvation, that the Lord would go to the dispersion of the Gentiles, and
would fulfill that which they read but did not understand. “A people
whom I have not known served me, and by the hearing of the ear obeyed
me.”  <span id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608.md) They before whose eyes He
was, heard Him not; those heard Him in whose ears He was sounded.

<span id="iii.xxxii-p32"></span>11. For of that Church of the Gentiles
which was to come, the woman that had the issue of blood was a type: she
touched and was not seen; she was not known and yet was healed. It was
in reality a figure what the Lord asked: “Who touched me?” As if not
knowing, He healed her as unknown: so has He done also to the Gentiles.
We did not get to know Him in the flesh, yet we have been made worthy to
eat His flesh, and to be members in His flesh. In what way? Because He
sent to us. Whom? His heralds, His disciples, His servants, His redeemed
whom He created, but whom He redeemed, His brethren also. I have said
but little of all that they are: His own members, Himself; for He sent
to us His own members, and He made us His members. Nevertheless, Christ
has not been among us with the bodily form which the Jews saw and
despised; because this also was said concerning Him, even as the apostle
says: “Now I say that Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the
truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.” <span
id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609.md) He owed it to have come to those by
whose fathers and to whose fathers He was promised. For this reason He
says also Himself: “I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house
of Israel.” <span id="fr_610"></span>[611](#fn_610.md) But what says the
apostle in the following words? “And that the Gentiles might glorify God
for His mercy.” What, moreover, saith the Lord Himself? “Other sheep I
have which are not of this fold.” <span
id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611.md) He who had said, “I am not sent but
unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel,” how has He other sheep to
which He was not sent, except that He intimated that He was not sent to
show His bodily presence but to the Jews only, who saw and killed Him?
And yet many of them, both before and afterwards, believed. The first
harvest was winnowed from the cross, that there might be a seed whence
another harvest might spring up. But at this present time, when roused
by the fame of the gospel, and by its goodly odor, His faithful ones
among all nations believe, He shall be the expectation of the Gentiles,
when He shall come who has already come; when He shall be seen by all,
He who was then not seen by some, by some was seen; when He shall come
to judge who came to be judged; when He shall come to distinguish who
came not to be distinguish <span id="page_193">p. 193</span> <span
id="iii.xxxii-Page_193"></span>ed. For Christ was not discerned by the
ungodly, but was condemned with the ungodly; for it was said concerning
Him, “He was accounted among the wicked.” <span
id="fr_612"></span>[613](#fn_612.md) The robber escaped, Christ was
condemned. He who was loaded with criminal accusations received pardon;
He who has released from their crimes all who confess Him, was
condemned. Nevertheless even the cross itself, if thou considerest it
well, was a judgment-seat; for the Judge being set up in the middle, one
thief who believed was delivered, the other who reviled was
condemned. <span id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613.md) Already He signified
what He is to do with the quick and the dead: some He will set on His
right hand and others on His left. That thief was like those that shall
be on the left hand, the other like those that shall be on the right. He
was undergoing judgment, and He threatened judgment.
