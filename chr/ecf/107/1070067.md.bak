<span id="iii.lxv-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.lxv-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXIV.</span>

<span id="iii.lxv-p2"></span><span id="iii.lxv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lxv-p2.2"></span>Chapter XIII. 31–32</span>.

<span id="iii.lxv-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxv-p3.1"></span>It</span> becomes us, dearly beloved, to keep
in view the orderly connection of our Lord’s words. For after having
previously said, but subsequently to Judas’ departure, and his
separation from even the outward communion of the saints, “Now is the
Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him;”—whether He said so
as pointing to His future kingdom, when the wicked shall be separated
from the good, or that His resurrection was then to take place, that is,
was not to be delayed, like ours, till the end of the world;—and having
then added, “If God is glorified in Him, God shall also glorify Him in
Himself, and shall straightway glorify Him,” whereby without any
ambiguity He testified to the immediate fulfillment of His own
resurrection; He proceeded to say, “Little children, yet a little while
I am with you.” To keep them, therefore, from thinking that God was to
glorify Him in such a way that He would never again be joined with them
in earthly intercourse, He said, “Yet a little while I am with you:” as
if He had said, Straightway indeed I shall be glorified in my
resurrection; and yet I am not straightway to ascend into heaven, but
“yet a little while I am with you.” For, as we find it written in the
Acts of the Apostles, He spent forty days with them after His
resurrection, going in and out, and eating and drinking: <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228.md) not indeed that He had any
experience of hunger and thirst, but even by such evidences confirmed
the reality of His flesh, which no longer needed, but still possessed
the power, to eat and to drink. Was it, then, these forty days He had in
view when He said, “Yet a little while I am with you,” or something
else? For it may also be understood in this way: “Yet a little while I
am with you;” still, like you, I also am in this state of fleshly
infirmity, that is, till He should die and rise again: for after He rose
again He was with them, as has been said, for forty days in the full
manifestation of His bodily presence; but He was no longer with them in
the fellowship of human infirmity.

<span id="iii.lxv-p5"></span>2. There is also another form of His divine
presence unknown to mortal senses, of which He likewise says, “Lo, I am
with you alway, even to the end of the world.” <span
id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229.md) This, at least, is not the same as
“yet a little while I am with you;” for it is not a little while until
the end of the world. Or if even this is so (for time flies, and a
thousand years are in God’s sight as one day, or as a watch in the
night,) <span id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230.md) yet we cannot believe
that He intended any such meaning on this occasion, especially as He
went on to say, “Ye shall seek me, and as I said unto the Jews, Whither
I go, ye cannot come.” That is to say, after this little while that I am
with you, “ye shall seek me, and whither I go, ye cannot come.” Is it
after the end of the world that, whither He goes, they will not be able
to come? And where, then, is the place of which He is going to say a
little after in this same discourse, “Father, I will that they also be
with me where I am”? <span id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231.md) It was
not then of that presence of His with His own which He is maintaining
with them till the end of the world that He now spake, when He said,
“Yet a little while I am with you;” but either of that state of mortal
infirmity in which He dwelt with them till His passion, or of that
bodily presence which He was to maintain with them up till His
ascension. Whichever of these any one prefers, he can do so without
being at variance with the faith.

<span id="iii.lxv-p9"></span>3. That no one, however, may deem that
sense inconsistent with the true one, in which we say that the Lord may
have meant the communion of mortal flesh which He held with the
disciples till His passion, when He said, “Yet a little while I am with
you;” let those words also of His after His resurrection, as found in
another evangelist, be taken into consideration, when He said, “These
are the words which I spake unto you, while I <span id="page_317">p.
317</span> <span id="iii.lxv-Page_317"></span>was yet with you:”  <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232.md) as if then He was no longer with
them, even at the very time that they were standing by, seeing,
touching, and talking with Him. What does He mean, then, by saying,
“while I was yet with you,” but, while I was yet in that state of mortal
flesh wherein ye still remain? For then, indeed, He had been raised
again in the same flesh; but He was no longer associated with them in
the same mortality. And accordingly, as on that occasion, when now
clothed in fleshly immortality, He said with truth, “while I was yet
with you,” to which we can attach no other meaning than, while I was yet
with you in fleshly mortality; so here also, without any absurdity, we
may understand His words, “Yet a little while I am with you,” as if He
had said, Yet a little while I am mortal like yourselves. Let us look,
then, at the words that follow.

<span id="iii.lxv-p11"></span>4. “Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto
the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so say I to you now.” That is,
ye cannot come *now*. But when He said so to the Jews, He did not add
the “now.” <span id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233.md) The former,
therefore, were not able at that time to come where He was going, but
they were so afterwards; because He says so a little afterwards in the
plainest terms to the Apostle Peter. For, on the latter inquiring,
“Lord, whither goest Thou?” He replied to him, “Whither I go thou canst
not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards” ([John
13.36](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#036.md)<span
id="iii.lxv-p12.3"></span>). But what it means is not to be carelessly
passed over. For whither was it that the disciples could not then follow
the Lord, but were able afterwards? If we say, to death, what time can
be discovered when any one of the sons of men will find it impossible to
die; since such, in this perishable body, is the lot of man, that
therein life is not a whit easier than death? They were not, therefore,
at that time less able to follow the Lord to death, but they were less
able to follow Him to the life which is deathless. For thither it was
the Lord was going, that, rising from the dead, He should die no more,
and death should no more have dominion over Him. <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234.md) For as the Lord was about to die
for righteousness’ sake, how could they have followed Him now, who were
as yet unripe for the ordeal of martyrdom? Or, with the Lord about to
enter the fleshly immortality, how could they have followed Him now,
when, even though ready to die, they would have no resurrection till the
end of the world? Or, on the point of going, as the Lord was, to the
bosom of the Father, and that without any forsaking of them, just as He
had never quitted that bosom in coming to them, how could they have
followed Him now, since no one can enter on that state of felicity but
he that is made perfect in love? And to show them, therefore, how it is
that they may attain the fitness to proceed, where He was going before
them, He says, “A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one
another” ([John 13.34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034.md)<span
id="iii.lxv-p13.2"></span>). These are the steps whereby Christ must be
followed; but any fuller discourse thereon must be put off till another
opportunity.
