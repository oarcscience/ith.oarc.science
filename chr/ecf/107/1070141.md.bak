<span id="iv.xiii-p3"></span>“Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth Him that begat Him,
loveth Him also that is begotten of Him. By this we know that we love
the children of God, because we love God, and do His commandments. For
this is the love of God that we keep His commandments.”

<span id="iv.xiii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iv.xiii-p4.1"></span>I Suppose</span> ye remember, those of you who
were present yesterday, to what place in the course of this epistle our
exposition has reached: namely, “He that loveth not his brother whom he
seeth, how can he love God whom he seeth not? And this commandment have
we from Him, That he who loveth God, love his brother also.” <span
id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485.md) Thus far we discoursed. Let us see
then what comes next in order. “Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
Christ is born of God.” <span id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486.md) Who
is he that believeth not that Jesus is the Christ? He that does not so
live as Christ commanded. For many say, “I believe:” but faith without
works saveth not. Now the work of faith is Love, as Paul the apostle
saith, “And faith which worketh by love.” <span
id="fr_2487"></span>[2488](#fn_2487.md) Thy past works indeed, before thou
didst believe, were either none, or if they seemed good, were nothing
worth. For if they were none, thou wast as a man without feet, or with
sore feet unable to walk: but if they seemed good, before thou didst
believe, thou didst run indeed, but by running aside from the way thou
wentest astray instead of coming to the goal. It is for us, then, both
to run, and to run in the way. He that runs aside from the way, runs to
no purpose, or rather runs but to toil. He goes the more astray, the
more he runs aside from the way. What is the way by which we run? Christ
hath told us, “I am the Way.” <span id="fr_2488"></span>[2489](#fn_2488.md)
What the home to which we run? “I am the Truth.” By Him thou runnest, to
Him thou runnest, in Him thou restest. But, that we might run by Him, He
reached even unto us: for we were afar off, foreigners in a far country.
Not enough that we were in a far country, we were feeble also that we
could not stir. A Physician, He came to the sick: a Way, He extended
Himself to them that were in a far country. Let us be saved by Him, let
us walk in Him. This it is to “believe that Jesus is the Christ,” as
Christians believe, who are not Christians only in name, but in deeds
and in life, not as the devils believe. For “the devils also believe and
tremble,” <span id="fr_2489"></span>[2490](#fn_2489.md) as the Scripture
tells us. What more could the devils believe, than that they should say,
“We know who thou art, the Son of God?” <span
id="fr_2490"></span>[2491](#fn_2490.md) What the devils said, the same said
Peter also. When the Lord asked them who He was, and whom did men say
that He was, the disciples made answer to Him, “Some say that thou art
John the Baptist; some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the
prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living
God.” <span id="fr_2491"></span>[2492](#fn_2491.md) And this he heard from
the Lord: “Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not
revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.” See what
praises follow this faith. “Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will
build my Church.” What meaneth, “Upon this rock I will build my Church”?
Upon this faith; upon this that has been said, “Thou art the Christ, the
Son of the Living God. Upon this rock,” saith He, “I will build my
Church.” Mighty praise! So then, Peter saith, “Thou art the Christ, the
Son of the Living God:” the devils also say, “We know who thou art, the
Son of God, the Holy One of God.” This Peter said, this also the devils:
the words the same, the mind not the same. And how is it clear that
Peter said this with love? Because a Christian’s faith is with love, but
a devil’s without love. How without love? Peter said this, that he might
embrace Christ; the devils said it, that Christ might depart from them.
For before they said, “We know who thou art, the Son of God,” they said,
“What have we to do with thee? Why art thou come to destroy us before
the time?” It is one thing then to confess Christ that thou mayest hold
Christ, another thing to confess Christ that thou mayest drive Christ
from thee. So then ye see, that in the sense in which he here saith,
“Whoso believeth,” it is a faith of <span id="page_521">p. 521</span>
<span id="iv.xiii-Page_521"></span>one’s own, not as one has a faith in
common with many. Therefore, brethren, let none of the heretics say to
you, “We also believe.” For to this end have I given you an instance
from the case of devils, that ye may not rejoice in the words of
believing, but search well the deeds of the life.

<span id="iv.xiii-p12"></span>2. Let us see then what it is to believe
in Christ; what to believe that Jesus, He is the Christ. He proceeds:
“Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God.” But what
is it to believe that? “And every one that loveth Him that begat Him,
loveth Him also that is begotten of Him.” To faith he hath straightway
joined love, because faith without love is nothing worth. With love, the
faith of a Christian; without love, the faith of a devil: but those who
believe not, are worse than devils, more stupid than devils. Some man
will not believe in Christ: so far, he is not even upon a par with
devils. A person does now believe in Christ, but hates Christ: he hath
the confession of faith in the fear of punishment, not in love of the
crown: thus the devils also feared to be punished. Add to this faith
love, that it may become a faith such as the Apostle Paul speaks of, a
“faith which worketh by love:”  <span
id="fr_2492"></span>[2493](#fn_2492.md) thou hast found a Christian, found
a citizen of Jerusalem, found a fellow-citizen of the angels, found a
pilgrim sighing in the way: join thyself to him, he is thy
fellow-traveller, run with him, if indeed thou also art this. “Every one
that loveth Him that begat Him, loveth Him also that is begotten of
Him.” Who “begat”? The Father. Who “is begotten”? The Son. What saith he
then? “Every one that loveth the Father, loveth the Son.”

<span id="iv.xiii-p14"></span>3. “In this we know that we love the sons
of God.” <span id="fr_2493"></span>[2494](#fn_2493.md) What is this,
brethren? Just now he was speaking of the Son of God, not of sons of
God: lo, here one Christ was set before us to contemplate, and we were
told, “Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and
every one that loveth Him that begat,” *i.e.* the Father, “loveth Him
also that is begotten of Him,” *i.e.* the Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.
And he goes on: “In this we know that we love the sons of God;” as if he
had been about to say, “In this we know that we love the Son of God.” He
has said, “the sons of God,” whereas he was speaking just before of the
Son of God—because the sons of God are the Body of the Only Son of God,
and when He is the Head, we the members, it is one Son of God.
Therefore, he that loves the sons of God, loves the Son of God, and he
that loves the Son of God, loves the Father; nor can any love the Father
except he love the Son, and he that loves the sons, loves also the Son
of God. What sons of God? The members of the Son of God. And by loving
he becomes himself a member, and comes through love to be in the frame
of the body of Christ, so there shall be one Christ, loving Himself. For
when the members love one another, the body loves itself. “And whether
one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be
honored, all the members rejoice with it.” <span
id="fr_2494"></span>[2495](#fn_2494.md) And then he goes on to say, “Now ye
are the body of Christ, and members.” John was speaking just before of
brotherly love, and said, “He that loveth not his brother whom he seeth,
how can he love God whom he seeth not?” <span
id="fr_2495"></span>[2496](#fn_2495.md) But if thou lovest thy brother,
haply thou lovest thy brother and lovest not Christ? How should that be,
when thou lovest members of Christ? When therefore thou lovest members
of Christ, thou lovest Christ; when thou lovest Christ, thou lovest the
Son of God; when thou lovest the Son of God, thou lovest also the
Father. The love therefore cannot be separated into parts. Choose what
thou wilt love; the rest follow thee. Suppose thou say, I love God
alone, God the Father. Thou liest: if thou lovest, thou lovest Him not
alone; but if thou lovest the Father, thou lovest also the Son. Behold,
sayest thou, I love the Father, and I love the Son: but this only, the
Father God and the Son God, our Lord Jesus Christ, who ascended into
heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father, that Word by which
all things were made, and “the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us:”
this alone I love. Thou liest; for if thou lovest the Head, thou lovest
also the members; but if thou lovest not the members, neither lovest
thou the Head. Dost thou not quake at the voice uttered by the Head from
Heaven on behalf of His members, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
ME?” <span id="fr_2496"></span>[2497](#fn_2496.md) The persecutor of His
members He called His persecutor: His lover, the lover of His members.
Now what are His members, ye know, brethren: none other than the Church
of God. “In this we know that we love the sons of God, in that we love
God.” And how? Are not the sons of God one thing, God Himself another?
But he that loves God, loves His precepts. And what are the precepts of
God? “A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another.”
 <span id="fr_2497"></span>[2498](#fn_2497.md) Let none excuse himself by
another love, for another love; so and so <span id="page_522">p.
522</span> <span id="iv.xiii-Page_522"></span>only is it with this love:
as the love itself is compacted in one, so all that hang by it doth it
make one, and as fire melts them down into one. It is gold: the lump is
molten and becomes some one thing. But unless the fervor of charity be
applied, of many there can be no melting down into one. “That we love
God,” by this “know we that we love the sons of God.”

<span id="iv.xiii-p20"></span>4. And by what do we know that we love the
sons of God? By this, “that we love God, and do His commandments.” We
sigh here, by reason of the hardness of doing the commandments of God.
Hear what follows. O man, at what toilest thou in loving? In loving
avarice. With toil is that loved which thou lovest: there is no toil in
loving God. Avarice will enjoin thee labors, perils, sore hardships and
tribulations; and thou wilt do its bidding. To what end? That thou
mayest have that with which thou shalt fill thy chest, and lose thy
peace of mind. Thou didst feel thyself haply more secure before thou
hadst it, than since thou didst begin to have. See what avarice has
enjoined thee. Thou hast filled thine house, and art in dread of
robbers; hast gotten gold, lost thy sleep. See what avarice has enjoined
thee. Do, and thou didst. What does God enjoin thee! Love me. Thou
lovest gold, thou wilt seek gold, and perchance not find it: whoso seeks
me, I am with him. Thou wilt love honor, and perchance not attain unto
it: who ever loved me, and did not attain? God saith to thee, thou
wouldest make thee a patron, or a powerful friend: thou seekest a way to
his favor by means of another inferior. Love me, saith God to thee:
favor with me is not had by making interest with some other: thy love
itself makes me present to thee. What sweeter than this love, brethren?
It is not without reason that ye heard just now in the Psalm, “The
unrighteous told me of delights, <span
id="fr_2498"></span>[2499](#fn_2498.md) but not as is Thy law, O
Lord.” <span id="fr_2499"></span>[2500](#fn_2499.md) What is the Law of
God? The commandment of God. What is the commandment of God? That “new
commandment,” which is called new because it maketh new: “A new
commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another.” <span
id="fr_2500"></span>[2501](#fn_2500.md) Hear because this is the law of
God. The apostle saith, “Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so shall ye
fulfill the law of Christ.” <span id="fr_2501"></span>[2502](#fn_2501.md)
This, even this, is the consummation of all our works; Love. In it is
the end: for this we run: to it we run; when we are come to it, we shall
rest.

<span id="iv.xiii-p25"></span>5. Ye have heard in the Psalm, “I have
seen the end of all perfection.” <span
id="fr_2502"></span>[2503](#fn_2502.md) He hath said, I have seen the end
of all perfection: what had he seen? Think we, had he ascended to the
peak of some very high and pointed mountain, and looked out thence and
seen the compass of the earth, and the circles of the round world, and
therefore said, “I have seen the end of all perfection”? If this be a
thing to be praised, let us ask of the Lord eyes of the flesh so
sharp-sighted, that we shall but require some exceeding high mountain on
earth, that from its summit we may see the end of all perfection. Go not
far: lo, I say to thee, it is here; ascend the mountain, and see the
end. Christ is the Mountain; come to Christ: thou seest thence the end
of all perfection. What is this end? Ask Paul: “But the end of the
commandment is charity, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and
faith unfeigned:” <span id="fr_2503"></span>[2504](#fn_2503.md) and in
another place, “Charity is the fullness,” or fulfillment, “of the law.”
What so finished and terminated as “fullness”? For, brethren, the
apostle here uses *end* in a way of praise. Think not of consumption,
but of consummation. For it is in one sense that one says, I have
finished my bread, in another, I have finished my coat. I have finished
the bread, by eating it: the coat, by making it. In both places the word
is “end,” “finish:” but the bread is finished by its being consumed, the
coat is finished by being made: the bread, so as to be no more; the
coat, so as to be complete. Therefore in this sense take ye also this
word, end, when the Psalm is read and ye hear it said, “On the end, a
Psalm of David.” <span id="fr_2504"></span>[2505](#fn_2504.md) Ye are for
ever hearing this in the Psalms, and ye should know what ye hear. What
meaneth, “On the end”?—“For Christ is the end of the law unto every one
that believeth.” <span id="fr_2505"></span>[2506](#fn_2505.md) And what
meaneth, “Christ is the end”? Because Christ is God, and “the end of the
commandment is charity,” and “Charity is God:” because Father and Son
and Holy Ghost are One. There is He the End to thee; elsewhere He is the
Way. Do not stick fast in the way, and so never come to the end.
Whatever else thou come to, pass beyond it, until thou come to the end.
What is the end? It is good for me to “hold me fast in God.”  <span
id="fr_2506"></span>[2507](#fn_2506.md) Hast thou laid fast hold on God?
thou hast finished the way: thou shalt abide in thine own country. Mark
well! Some man seeks money: let not it be the end to thee: pass on, as a
traveller in a strange land. But if thou love it, thou art entangled
<span id="page_523">p. 523</span> <span id="iv.xiii-Page_523"></span>by
avarice; avarice will be shackles to thy feet: thou canst make no more
progress. Pass therefore this also: seek the end. Thou seekest health of
the body: still do not stop there. For what is it, this health of the
body, which death makes an end of, which sickness debilitates, a feeble,
mortal, fleeting thing? Seek that, indeed, lest haply ill-health hinder
thy good works: but for that very reason, the end is not there, for it
is sought in order to something else. Whatever is sought in order to
something else, the end is not there: whatever is loved for its own
sake, and freely, the end is there. Thou seekest honors; perchance
seekest them in order to do something, that thou mayest accomplish
something, and so please God: love not the honor itself, lest thou stop
there. Seekest thou praise? If thou seek God’s, thou doest well; if thou
seek thine own, thou doest ill; thou stoppest short in the way. But
behold, thou art loved, art praised: think it not joy when in thyself
thou art praised; be thou praised in the Lord, that thou mayest sing,
“In the Lord shall my soul be praised.” <span
id="fr_2507"></span>[2508](#fn_2507.md) Thou deliverest some good
discourse, and thy discourse is praised. Let it not be praised as thine,
the end is not there. If thou set the end there, there is an end of
thee: but an end, not that thou be perfected, but that thou be consumed.
Then let not thy discourse be praised as coming from thee, as being
thine. But how praised? As the Psalm saith, “In God will I praise the
discourse, in God will I praise the word.” <span
id="fr_2508"></span>[2509](#fn_2508.md) Hereby shall that which there
follows come to pass in thee: “In God have I hoped, I will not fear what
man can do unto me.” <span id="fr_2509"></span>[2510](#fn_2509.md) For when
all things that are thine are praised in God, no fear lest thy praise be
lost, since God faileth not. Pass therefore this also.

<span id="iv.xiii-p34"></span>6. See, brethren, how many things we pass,
in which is not the end. These we use as by the way; we take as it were
our refreshment at the halting places on our journey, and pass on. <span
id="fr_2510"></span>[2511](#fn_2510.md) Where then is the end? “Beloved, we
are sons of God, and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be;” <span
id="fr_2511"></span>[2512](#fn_2511.md) here is this said, in this epistle.
As yet then, we are on the way; as yet, wherever we come, we must pass
on, until we attain unto some end. “We know that when He shall appear,
we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. That is the end;
there perpetual praising, there Alleluia <span
id="fr_2512"></span>[2513](#fn_2512.md) always without fail. This, then is
the end he has spoken of in the Psalm: “I have seen the end of all
perfection:” <span id="fr_2513"></span>[2514](#fn_2513.md) and as though it
were said to him, What is the end thou hast seen? “Thy commandment,
exceeding broad.” This is the end: the breadth of the commandment. The
breadth of the commandment is charity, because where charity is, there
are no straits. In this breadth, this wide room, was the apostle when he
said, “Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians, our heart is
enlarged: ye are not straitened in us.” <span
id="fr_2514"></span>[2515](#fn_2514.md) In this, then, is “Thy commandment
exceeding broad.” What is the broad commandment? “A new commandment give
I unto you, that ye love one another.” Charity, then, is not straitened.
Wouldest thou not be straitened here on earth? Dwell in the broad room.
For whatever man may do to thee, he shall not straiten thee; because
thou lovest that which man cannot hurt: lovest God, lovest the
brotherhood, lovest the law of God, lovest the Church of God: it shall
be for ever. Thou laborest here on earth, but thou shalt come to the
promised enjoyment. Who can take from thee that which thou lovest? If no
man can take from thee that which thou lovest, secure thou sleepest: or
rather secure thou watchest, lest by sleeping thou lose that which thou
lovest. For not without reason is it said, “Enlighten mine eyes, lest at
any time I sleep in death.” <span id="fr_2515"></span>[2516](#fn_2515.md)
They that shut their eyes against charity, fall asleep in the lusts of
carnal delights. Be wakeful, therefore. For then are the delights, to
eat, to drink, to wanton in luxury, to play, to hunt; these vain pomps
all evils follow. Are we ignorant that they are delights? who can deny
that they delight? But more beloved is the law of God. Cry against such
persuaders: “The unrighteous have told me of delights: but not so as is
thy law, O Lord.”  <span id="fr_2516"></span>[2517](#fn_2516.md) This
delight remaineth. Not only remaineth as the goal to which thou mayest
come, but also calleth thee back when thou fleest.

<span id="iv.xiii-p42"></span>7. “For this is the love of God, that we
keep His commandments.” <span id="fr_2517"></span>[2518](#fn_2517.md)
Already ye have heard, “On these two commandments hang all the law and
the prophets.” See how He would not have thee divide thyself over a
multitude of pages: “On these two commandments hang all the law and the
prophets.” On what two commandments? “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. And,
thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang
all the law and the prophets.”  <span
id="fr_2518"></span>[2519](#fn_2518.md) See here of what commandments this
whole epis <span id="page_524">p. 524</span> <span
id="iv.xiii-Page_524"></span>tle talks. Therefore hold fast love, and
set your minds at rest. Why fearest thou lest thou do evil to some man?
Who does evil to the man he loves? Love <span
id="fr_2519"></span>[2520](#fn_2519.md) thou: it is impossible to do this
without doing good. But it may be, thou rebukest? Kindness <span
id="fr_2520"></span>[2521](#fn_2520.md) does it, not fierceness. But it may
be thou beatest? For discipline thou dost this; because thy kindness of
love <span id="fr_2521"></span>[2522](#fn_2521.md) will not let thee leave
him undisciplined. And indeed there come somehow these different and
contrary results, that sometimes hatred uses winning ways, and charity
shows itself fierce. A person hates his enemy, and feigns friendship for
him: he sees him doing some evil, he praises him: he wishes him to go
headlong, wishes him to go blind over the precipice of his lusts, haply
never to return; he praises him, “For the sinner is praised in the
desires of his soul;”  <span id="fr_2522"></span>[2523](#fn_2522.md) he
applies to him the unction of adulation; behold, he hates, and praises.
Another sees his friend doing something of the same sort; he calls him
back; if he will not hear, he uses words even of castigation, he scolds,
he quarrels: <span id="fr_2523"></span>[2524](#fn_2523.md) there are times
when it comes to this, that one must even quarrel! Behold, hatred shows
itself winningly gentle, and charity quarrels! Stay not thy regard upon
the words of seeming kindness, or the seeming cruelty of the rebuke;
look into the vein <span id="fr_2524"></span>[2525](#fn_2524.md) they come
from; seek the root whence they proceed. The one is gentle and bland
that he may deceive, the other quarrels that he may correct. Well then,
it is not for us, brethren, to enlarge your heart: obtain from God the
gift to love one another. Love all men, even your enemies, not because
they are your brethren, but that they may be your brethren; that ye may
be at all times on fire with brotherly love, whether toward him that is
become thy brother, or towards thine enemy, so that, by being beloved,
he may become thy brother. Wheresoever ye love a brother, ye love a
friend. Now is he with thee, now is he knit to thee in unity, yea
catholic unity. If thou art living aright, thou lovest a brother made
out of an enemy. But thou lovest some man who has not yet believed
Christ, or, if he have believed, believes as do the devils: thou
rebukest his vanity. Do thou love, and that with a brotherly love: he is
not yet a brother, but thou lovest to the end he may be a brother. Well
then, all our love is a brotherly love, towards Christians, towards all
His members. The discipline of charity, my brethren, its strength,
flowers, fruit, beauty, pleasantness, food, drink, meat, embracing, hath
in it no satiety. If it so delight us while in a strange land, in our
own country how shall we rejoice!

<span id="iv.xiii-p51"></span>8. Let us run then, my brethren, let us
run, and love Christ. What Christ? Jesus Christ. Who is He? The Word of
God. And how came He to the sick? “The Word was made flesh, and dwelt in
us.” <span id="fr_2525"></span>[2526](#fn_2525.md) It is complete then,
which the Scripture foretold, “Christ must suffer, and rise again the
third day from the dead.” <span id="fr_2526"></span>[2527](#fn_2526.md) His
body, where is it? His members, where toil they? Where must thou be,
that thou mayest be under thine Head? “And that repentance and remission
of sins be preached in His name through all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem.” <span id="fr_2527"></span>[2528](#fn_2527.md) There let thy
charity be spread abroad. Christ saith, and the Psalm, *i.e.* the Spirit
of God, “Thy commandment is exceeding broad:” and forsooth some man will
have charity to be confined to Africa! Extend thy charity over the whole
earth if thou wilt love Christ, for Christ’s members are over all the
earth. If thou lovest but a part, thou art divided: if thou art divided,
thou art not in the body; if thou art not in the body, thou art not
under the Head. What profiteth it thee that thou believest <span
id="fr_2528"></span>[2529](#fn_2528.md) and blasphemest? Thou adorest Him
in the Head, blasphemest Him in the Body. He loves His Body. If thou
hast cut thyself off from His Body, the Head hath not cut itself off
from its Body. To no purpose dost thou honor me, cries thine Head to
thee from on high, to no purpose dost thou honor me. It is all one as if
a man would kiss thine head and tread upon thy feet: perchance with
nailed boots he would crush thy feet, while he will clasp thy head and
kiss it: wouldest thou not cry out in the midst of the words with which
he honors thee, and say, What art thou doing, man? thou treadest on me.
Thou wouldest not mean, Thou treadest on my head; for the head he
honored; but more would the head cry out for the members trodden upon,
than for itself because it was honored. Does not the head itself cry
out, I will none of thine honor; do not tread on me? Now say if thou
canst, How have I trodden upon thee? say that to the head: I wanted to
kiss thee, I wanted to embrace thee. But seest thou not, O fool, that
what thou wouldest embrace does in virtue of a certain unity, which
knits the whole frame together, reach to that which thou treadest upon?
Above <span id="fr_2529"></span>[2530](#fn_2529.md) thou honorest me,
beneath <span id="fr_2530"></span>[2531](#fn_2530.md) thou treadest upon
me. That on which thou treadest pains more than that which thou honorest
rejoiceth. In what sort does the tongue cry out? “It hurts me.” <span
id="page_525">p. 525</span> <span id="iv.xiii-Page_525"></span>It saith
not, “It hurts my foot,” but, “It hurts me,” saith it. O tongue, who has
touched thee? who has struck? who has goaded? who has pricked? No man,
but I am knit together with the parts that are trodden upon. How
wouldest thou have me not be pained, when I am not separate?

<span id="iv.xiii-p58"></span>9. Our Lord Jesus Christ, then, ascending
into heaven on the fortieth day, did for this reason commend to us His
Body where it would continue to lie, because He saw that many would
honor Him for that He is ascended into heaven: and saw that their
honoring Him is useless if they trample upon His members here on earth.
And lest any one should err, and, while he adored the Head in heaven
should trample upon the feet on earth, He told us where would be His
members. For being about to ascend, He spake His last words on earth:
after those same words He spake no more on earth. The Head about to
ascend into heaven commended to us His members on earth and departed.
Thenceforth thou findest not Christ speaking on earth; thou findest Him
speaking, but from heaven. And even from heaven, why? Because His
members on earth were trodden upon. For to the persecutor Saul He said
from on high, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?”  <span
id="fr_2531"></span>[2532](#fn_2531.md) I am ascended into heaven, but
still I lie on earth: here I sit at the right hand of the Father, but
there I yet hunger, thirst, and am a stranger. In what manner then did
He commend to us His Body, when about to ascend into heaven? When the
disciples asked Him, saying, “Lord, wilt thou at this time present <span
id="fr_2532"></span>[2533](#fn_2532.md) thyself, and when shall be the
kingdom of Israel?” <span id="fr_2533"></span>[2534](#fn_2533.md) He made
answer, now at the point to depart, “It is not for you to know the time
which the Father hath put in His own power: but ye shall receive
strength of the Holy Ghost coming upon you, and ye shall be witnesses to
me.” See where His Body is spread abroad, see where He will not be
trodden upon: “Ye shall be witnesses to me, unto Jerusalem, and unto
Judea, and even unto all the earth.” Lo, where I lie that am ascending!
For I ascend, because I am the Head: my Body lies yet beneath. Where
lies? Throughout the whole earth. Beware thou strike not, beware thou
hurt not, beware thou trample not: these be the last words of Christ
about to go into heaven. Look at a sick man languishing on his bed,
lying in his house, and worn out with sickness, at death’s door, his
soul as it were even now between his teeth: who, anxious, it may be,
about something that is dear to him, which he greatly loves, and it
comes into his mind, calls his heirs, and says to them, I pray you, do
this. He, as it were, detains his soul by a violent effort, that it may
not depart ere those words be made sure. When he has dictated those last
words, he breathes out his soul, he is borne a corpse to the sepulchre.
His heirs, how do they remember the last words of the dying man? How, if
one should stand up and say to them, Do it not: what would they say?
“What? shall I not do that which my father, in the act of breathing out
his soul, commanded me with his last breath, the last word of his that
sounded in my ears when my father was departing this life? Whatever
other words of his I may not regard, his last have a stronger hold upon
me: since which I never saw him more, never more heard speech of his.”
Brethren, think with Christian hearts; if to the heirs of a man, his
words spoken when about to go to the tomb are so sweet, so grateful, so
weighty, what must we account of the last words of Christ, spoken not
when about to go back to the tomb, but to ascend into heaven! As for the
man who lived and is dead, his soul is hurried off to other places, his
body is laid in the earth, and whether these words of his be done or
not, makes no difference to him: he has now something else to do, or
something else to suffer: either in Abraham’s bosom he rejoices, or in
eternal fire he longs for a drop of water, while his corpse lies there
senseless in the sepulchre; and yet the last words of the dying man are
kept. What have those to look for, who keep not the last words of Him
that sitteth in heaven, who seeth from on high whether they be despised
or not despised? The words of Him, who said, “Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou <span class="c10"><span
id="iv.xiii-p61.2"></span>Me</span>?” who keeps account, unto the
judgment, of all that He seeth His members suffer?

<span id="iv.xiii-p62"></span>10. And what have we done, say they? We
are the persecuted, not the persecutors. Ye are the persecutors, O
wretched men. In the first place, in that ye have divided the Church.
Mightier the sword of the tongue than the sword of steel. Agar, Sarah’s
maid, was proud, and she was afflicted by her mistress for her pride.
That was discipline, not punishment. <span
id="fr_2534"></span>[2535](#fn_2534.md) Accordingly, when she had gone away
from her mistress, what said the angel to her? “Return to thy
mistress.” <span id="fr_2535"></span>[2536](#fn_2535.md) Then, O carnal
soul, like a proud bond-woman, suppose thou have suffered any trouble
for discipline’ sake, why ravest thou? “Return to thy mistress,” hold
fast the peace of the Church. <span id="fr_2536"></span>[2537](#fn_2536.md)
Lo, the gospels are pro <span id="page_526">p. 526</span> <span
id="iv.xiii-Page_526"></span>duced, we read where the Church is spread
abroad: men dispute against us, and say to us, “Betrayers!” <span
id="fr_2537"></span>[2538](#fn_2537.md) Betrayers of what? Christ
commendeth to us His Church, and thou believest not: shall I believe
thee, when thou revilest my parents? Wouldest thou that I should believe
thee about the “betrayers”? Do thou first believe Christ. What is worth
believing? Christ is God, thou art man: which ought to be believed
first? Christ has spread His Church abroad over all the earth: I say
it—despise me: the gospel speaks—beware. What saith the gospel? “It
behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead on the third
day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His
name.” <span id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538.md) Where remission of
sins, there the Church is. How the Church? Why, to her it was said, “To
thee I will give the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou
shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven, and whatsoever thou
shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.” <span
id="fr_2539"></span>[2540](#fn_2539.md) Where is this remission of sins
spread abroad? “Through all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” Lo,
believe Christ! But, because thou art well aware that if thou shalt
believe Christ, thou wilt not have anything to say about “betrayers,”
thou wilt needs have me to believe thee when thou speakest evil against
my parents, rather than thyself believe what Christ foretold!

<span id="iv.xiii-p70"></span>\[The remainder of the Homily is wanting
in all the manuscripts. It seems also that St. Augustin was hindered
from completing the exposition of the entire epistle, as he had
undertaken to do: at least Possidius specifies this work under the
title, “*In Epist. Joannis ad Parthos Tractatus decem*,” and it is
scarcely likely that the whole of the fifth chapter was expounded in
this tenth Homily.—Of the “Sermons,” there are none upon the remaining
part of this epistle: the following extracts from other works of St.
Augustin will supply what will be most desiderated: namely, his
exposition of the text on “the Three Witnesses,” of “the sin unto
death,” and of the twentieth verse\].
