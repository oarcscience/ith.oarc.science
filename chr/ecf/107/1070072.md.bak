id="iii.lxx-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXIX.</span>

<span id="iii.lxx-p2"></span><span id="iii.lxx-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lxx-p2.2"></span>Chapter XIV. 4–6</span>.

<span id="iii.lxx-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxx-p3.1"></span>We</span> have now the opportunity, dearly,
beloved, as far as we can, of understanding the earlier words of the
Lord from the later, and His previous statements by those that follow,
in what you have heard was His answer to the question of the Apostle
Thomas. For when the Lord was speaking above of the mansions, of which
He both said that they already were in His Father’s house, and that He
was going to prepare them; where we understood that those mansions
already existed in predestination, and are also being prepared through
the purifying by faith of the hearts of those who are hereafter to
inhabit them, seeing that they themselves are the very house of God; and
what else is it to dwell in God’s house than to be in the number of His
people, since His people are at the same time in God, and God in them?
To make this preparation the Lord departed, that by believing in Him,
though no longer visible, the mansion, whose outward form is always hid
in the future, may now by faith be prepared: for this reason, therefore,
He had said, “And if I go away and prepare a place for you, I will come
again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.” In reply to this,
“Thomas saith unto Him, Lord, we know not whither Thou goest: and how
can we know the way?” Both of these the Lord had said that they knew;
both of them this other declares that he does not know, to wit, the
place to which, and the way whereby, He is going. But he does not know
that he is speaking falsely; they knew, therefore, and did not know that
they knew. He will convince them that they already know what they
imagine themselves still to be ignorant of. “Jesus saith unto him, I am
the way, and the truth, and the life.” What, brethren, does He mean?
See, we have just heard the disciple asking, and the Master instructing,
and we do not yet, even after His voice has sounded in our ears,
apprehend the thought that lies hid in His words. But what is it we
cannot apprehend? Could His apostles, with whom He was talking, have
said to Him, We do not know Thee? Accordingly, if they knew Him, and He
Himself is the way, they knew the way; if they knew Him who is Himself
the truth, they knew the truth; if they knew Him who is also the life,
they knew the life. Thus, you see, they were convinced that they knew
what they knew not that they knew.

<span id="iii.lxx-p4"></span>2. What is it, then, that we also have not
apprehended in this discourse? What else, think you, brethren, but just
that He said, “And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know”? And here
we have discovered that they knew the way, because they knew Him who is
the way: the way is that by which we go; but is the way the place also
to which we <span id="page_325">p. 325</span> <span
id="iii.lxx-Page_325"></span>go? And yet each of these He said that they
knew, both whither He was going, and the way. There was need, therefore,
for His saying, “I am the way,” in order to show those who knew Him that
they knew the way, which they thought themselves ignorant of; but what
need was there for His saying, “I am the way, and the truth, and the
life,” when, after knowing the way by which He went, they had still to
learn whither He was going, but just because it was to the truth and to
the life He was going? By Himself, therefore, He was going to Himself.
And whither go we, but to Him, and by what way go we, but by Him? He,
therefore, went to Himself by Himself, and we by Him to Him; yea,
likewise both He and we go thus to the Father. For He says also in
another place of Himself, “I go to the Father;” <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[1276](#fn_1275.md) and here on our account He says,
“No man cometh unto the Father but by me.” And in this way, He goeth by
Himself both to Himself and to the Father, and we by Him both to Him and
to the Father. Who can apprehend such things save he who has spiritual
discernment? and how much is it that even he can apprehend, although
thus spiritually discerning? Brethren, how can you desire me to explain
such things to you? Only reflect how lofty they are. You see what I am,
I see what you are; in all of us the body, which is corrupted, burdens
the soul, and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth
upon many things. <span id="fr_1276"></span>[1277](#fn_1276.md) Do we think
we can say, “To Thee have I lifted up my soul, O Thou that dwellest in
the heavens”? <span id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277.md) But burdened as
we are with so great a weight, under which we groan, how shall I lift up
my soul unless He lift it with me who laid His own down for me? I shall
speak then as I can, and let each of you who is able receive it. As He
gives, I speak; as He gives, the receiver receiveth; and as He giveth,
there is faith for him who cannot yet receive with understanding. For,
saith the prophet, “If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand.”
 <span id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278.md)

<span id="iii.lxx-p9"></span>3. Tell me, O my Lord, what to say to Thy
servants, my fellow-servants. The Apostle Thomas had Thee before him in
order to ask Thee questions, and yet could not understand Thee unless he
had Thee within him; I ask Thee because I know that Thou art over me;
and I ask, seeking, as far as I can, to let my soul diffuse itself in
that same region over me where I may listen to Thee, who usest no
external sound to convey Thy teaching. Tell me, I pray, how it is that
Thou goest to Thyself. Didst Thou formerly leave Thyself to come to us,
especially as Thou camest not of Thyself, but the Father sent Thee? I
know, indeed, that Thou didst empty Thyself; but in taking the form of a
servant, <span id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279.md) it was neither that
Thou didst lay down the form of God as something to return to, or that
Thou lost it as something to be recovered; and yet Thou didst come, and
didst place Thyself not only before the carnal eyes, but even in the
very hands of men. And how otherwise save in Thy flesh? By means of this
Thou didst come, yet abiding where Thou wast; by this means Thou didst
return, without leaving the place to which Thou hadst come. If, then, by
such means Thou didst come and return, by such means doubtless Thou art
not only the way for us to come unto Thee, but wast the way also for
Thyself to come and to return. For when Thou didst return to the life,
which Thou art Thyself, then of a truth that same flesh of Thine Thou
didst bring from death unto life. The Word of God, indeed, is one thing,
and man another; but the Word was made flesh, or became man. And so the
person of the Word is not different from that of the man, seeing that
Christ is both in one person; and in this way, just as when His flesh
died. Christ died, and when His flesh was buried, Christ was buried (for
thus with the heart we believe unto righteousness, and thus with the
mouth do we make confession unto salvation <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280) .md); so when the flesh came from
death unto life, Christ came to life. And because Christ is the Word of
God, He is also the life. And thus in a wonderful and ineffable manner
He, who never laid down or lost Himself, came to Himself. But God, as
was said, had come through the flesh to men, the truth to liars; for God
is true, and every man a liar. <span
id="fr_1281"></span>[1282](#fn_1281.md) When, therefore, He withdrew His
flesh from amongst men, and carried it up there where no liar is found,
He also Himself—for the Word was made flesh—returned by Himself, that
is, by His flesh, to the truth, which is none other but Himself. And
this truth, we cannot doubt, although found amongst liars, He preserved
even in death; for Christ was once dead, but never false.

<span id="iii.lxx-p13"></span>4. Take an example, very different in
character and wholly inadequate, yet in some lit <span id="page_326">p.
326</span> <span id="iii.lxx-Page_326"></span>tle measure helpful to the
understanding of God, from things that are in peculiarly intimate
subjection to God. See here in my own case, while as far as pertains to
my mind I am just the same as yourselves, if I keep silence I am so to
myself; but if I speak to you something suited to your understanding, in
a certain sense I go forth to you without leaving myself, but at the
same time approach you and yet quit not the place from which I proceed.
But when I cease speaking, I return in a kind of way to myself, and in a
kind of way I remain with you, if you retain what you have heard in the
discourse I am delivering. And if the mere image that God made is
capable of this, what may not God, the very image of God, not made by,
but born of God; whose body, wherein He came forth to us and returned
from us, has not ceased to be, like the sound of my voice, but abides
there, where it shall die no more, and death shall have no more dominion
over it? <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282.md) Much more, perhaps,
might and ought to have been said on these words of the Gospel; but your
souls ought not to be burdened with spiritual food, however pleasant,
especially as the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. <span

play in the Hebrew upon the verb <span class="Hebrew"><span

clauses, first in the *Hiphil*, where it means *to cleave fast to, to
show a firm trust in*; and secondly, in the *Niphal, to be held fast, to
be confirmed in one’s trust*. Hence the rendering of our English Bible
is more correct: “If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be
