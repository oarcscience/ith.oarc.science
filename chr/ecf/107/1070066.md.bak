<span id="iii.lxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.lxiv-p2"></span><span id="iii.lxiv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lxiv-p2.2"></span>Chapter XIII. 31–32</span>.

<span id="iii.lxiv-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxiv-p3.1"></span>Let</span> us give our mind’s best attention,
and, with the Lord’s help, seek after God. The language of the divine
hymn is: “Seek God and your soul shall live.” <span
id="fr_1220"></span>[1221](#fn_1220.md) Let us search for that which needs
to be discovered, and into that which has been discovered. He whom we
need to discover is concealed, in order to be sought after; and when
found, is infinite, in order still to be the object of our search. Hence
it is elsewhere said, “Seek His face evermore.” <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[1222](#fn_1221.md) For He satisfies the seeker to the
utmost of his capacity; and makes the finder still more capable, that he
may seek to be filled anew, according to the growth of his ability to
receive. Therefore it was not said, “Seek His face evermore,” in the
same sense as of certain others, who are “always learning, and never
coming to a knowledge of the truth;” <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[1223](#fn_1222.md) but rather as the preacher saith,
“When a man hath finished, then he beginneth;” <span
id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223.md) till we reach that life where we
shall be so filled, that our natures shall attain their utmost capacity,
because we shall have arrived at perfection, and no longer be aiming at
more. For then all that can satisfy us will be revealed to our eyes. But
here let us always be seeking, and let our reward in finding put no end
to our searching. For we do not say that it will not be so always,
because it is only so here; but that here we must always be seeking,
lest at any time we should imagine that here we can ever cease from
seeking. For those of whom it is said that they are “always learning,
and never coming to a knowledge of the truth,” are here indeed always
learning; but when they depart this life they will no longer be
learning, but receiving the reward of their error. For the words,
“always learning, and never coming to a knowledge of the truth,” mean,
as it were, always walking, and never getting into the road. Let us, on
the other hand, be walking always in the way, till we reach the end to
which it leads; let us nowhere tarry in it till we reach the proper
place of abode: and so we shall both persevere in our seeking, and be
making some attainments in our finding, and, thus seeking and finding,
be passing on to that which remains, till the very end of all seeking
shall be reached in that world where perfection shall admit of no
further effort at advancement. Let these prefatory remarks, dearly
beloved, make your Charity attentive to this discourse of our Lord’s,
which He addressed to the disciples before His passion: for it is
profound in it <span id="page_315">p. 315</span> <span
id="iii.lxiv-Page_315"></span>self; and where, in particular, the
preacher purposes to expend much labor, the hearer ought not to be
remiss in attention.

<span id="iii.lxiv-p8"></span>2. What is it, then, that the Lord says,
after that Judas went out, to do quickly what he purposed doing, namely,
betraying the Lord? What says the day when the night had gone out? What
says the Redeemer when the seller had departed? “Now,” He says, “is the
Son of man glorified.” Why “*now*”? It was not, was it, merely that His
betrayer was gone out, and that those were at hand who were to seize and
slay Him? Is it thus that He “is now glorified,” to wit, that His deeper
humiliation is approaching; that over Him are impending both bonds, and
judgment, and condemnation, and mocking, and crucifixion, and death? Is
this glorification, or rather humiliation? Even when He was working
miracles, does not this very John say of Him, “The Spirit was not yet
given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified”? <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224.md) Even then, therefore, when He was
raising the dead, He was not yet glorified; and is He glorified now,
when drawing near in His own person unto death? He was not yet glorified
when acting as God, and is He glorified in going to suffer as man? It
would be strange if it were this that God, the great Master, signified
and taught in such words. We must ascend higher to unveil the words of
the Highest, who reveals Himself somewhat that we may find Him, and anon
hides Himself that we may seek Him, and so press on step by step, as it
were, from discoveries already made to those that still await us. I get
here a sight of something that prefigures a great reality. Judas went
out, and Jesus is glorified; the son of perdition went out, and the Son
of man is glorified. He it was that had gone out, on whose account it
had been said to them all, “And ye are clean, but not all” (<span
id="iii.lxiv-p9.2"></span>ver. 10). When, therefore, the unclean one
departed, all that remained were clean, and continued with their
Cleanser. Something like this will it be when this world shall have been
conquered by Christ, and shall have passed away, and there shall be no
one that is unclean remaining among His people; when, the tares having
been separated from the wheat, the righteous shall shine forth as the
sun in the kingdom of their Father. <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225.md) The Lord, foreseeing such a future
as this, and in testimony that such was signified now in the separation
of the tares, as it were, by the departure of Judas, and the remaining
behind of the wheat in the persons of the holy apostles, said, “Now is
the Son of man glorified:” as if He had said, See, so will it be in that
day of my glorification yet to come, when none of the wicked shall be
present, and none of the good shall be wanting. His words, however, are
not expressed in this way: Now is *prefigured* the glorification of the
Son of man; but expressly, “Now is the Son of man glorified:” just as it
was not said, The Rock signified Christ; but, “That Rock *was*
Christ.” <span id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226.md) Nor is it said, The
good seed signified the children of the kingdom, or, The tares signified
the children of the wicked one; but what is said is, “The good seed,
these are the children of the kingdom; and the tares, the children of
the wicked one.” <span id="fr_1227"></span>[1228](#fn_1227.md) According,
then, to the usage of Scripture language, which speaks of the signs as
if they were the things signified, the Lord makes use of the words, “Now
is the Son of man glorified;” indicating that in the completed
separation of that arch sinner from their company, and in the remaining
around Him of His saints, we have the foreshadowing of His
glorification, when the wicked shall be finally separated, and He shall
dwell with His saints through eternity.

<span id="iii.lxiv-p13"></span>3. But after saying, “Now is the Son of
man glorified,” He added, “and God is glorified in Him.” For this is
itself the glorifying of the Son of man, that God should be glorified in
Him. For if He is not glorified in Himself, but God in Him, then it is
He whom God glorifies in Himself. And just as if to give them this
explanation, He furthers adds: “If God is glorified in Him, God shall
also glorify Him in Himself.” That is, “If God is glorified in Him,”
because He came not to do His own will, but the will of Him that sent
Him; “and God shall glorify Him in Himself,” in such wise that the human
nature, in which He is the Son of man, and which was so assumed by the
eternal Word, should also be endowed with an eternal immortality. “And,”
He says, “He shall straightway glorify Him;” predicting, to wit, by such
an asseveration, His own resurrection in the immediate future, and not,
as it were, ours in the end of the world. For it is this very
glorification of which the evangelist had previously said, as I
mentioned a little ago, that on this account the Spirit was not yet in
their case given in that new way, in which He was yet to be given after
the resurrection to those who believed, because that Jesus was not yet
glorified: that is, mortality was not yet clothed with immortality, and
temporal weakness transformed into eternal strength. This glorification
may also be indicated in the <span id="page_316">p. 316</span> <span
id="iii.lxiv-Page_316"></span>words, “Now is the Son of man glorified;”
so that the word “now” may be supposed to refer, not to His impending
passion, but to His closely succeeding resurrection, as if what was now
so near at hand had actually been accomplished. Let this suffice your
affection to-day; we shall take up, when the Lord permits us, the words
that follow.
