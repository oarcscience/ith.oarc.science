<span id="iii.lxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.lxxvi-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXXV.</span>

<span id="iii.lxxvi-p2"></span><span id="iii.lxxvi-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lxxvi-p2.2"></span>Chapter XIV. 18–21</span>.

<span id="iii.lxxvi-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxxvi-p3.1"></span>After</span> the promise of the Holy Spirit,
lest any should suppose that the Lord was to give Him, as it were, in
place of Himself, in any such way as that He Himself would not likewise
be with them, He added the words: “I will not leave you orphans; I will
come to you.” *<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.lxxvi-p3.2"></span>Orphani</span>* \[Greek\] are *pupilli*
\[parent-less children\] in Latin. The one is the Greek, the other the
Latin name of the same thing: for in the psalm where we read, “Thou art
the helper of the fatherless” \[in the Latin version, *pupillo*\], the
Greek has *<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.lxxvi-p3.3"></span>orphano</span>*. <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[1334](#fn_1333.md) Accordingly, although it was not
the Son of God that adopted sons to His Father, or willed that we should
have by grace that same Father, who is His Father by nature, yet in a
sense it is paternal feelings toward us that He Himself displays, when
He declares, “I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.” In the
same way He calls us also the children of the bridegroom, when He says,
“The time will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them,
and then shall the children of the bridegroom fast.” <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md) And who is the bridegroom, but
Christ the Lord?

<span id="iii.lxxvi-p6"></span>2. He then goes on to say, “Yet a little
while, and the world seeth me no more.” How so? the world saw Him then;
for under the name of the world are to be understood those of whom He
spake above, when saying of the Holy Spirit, “Whom the world cannot
receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him.” He was plainly
visible to the carnal eyes of the world, while manifest in the flesh;
but it saw not the Word that lay hid in the flesh: it saw the man, but
it saw not God: it saw the covering, but not the Being within. But as,
after the resurrection, even His very flesh, which He exhibited both to
the sight and to the handling of His own, <span id="page_336">p.
336</span> <span id="iii.lxxvi-Page_336"></span>He refused to exhibit to
others, we may in this way perhaps understand the meaning of the words,
“Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye shall see
me: because I live, ye shall live also.”

<span id="iii.lxxvi-p7"></span>3. What is meant by the words, “Because I
live, ye shall live also”? Why did He speak in the present tense of His
own living, and in the future of theirs, but just by way of promise that
the life also of the resurrection-body, as it preceded in His own case,
would certainly follow in theirs? And as His own resurrection was in the
immediate future, He put the word in the present tense to signify its
speedy approach: but of theirs, as delayed till the end of the world, He
said not, ye live; but, “ye shall live.” With elegance and brevity,
therefore, by means of two words, one of them in the present tense and
the other in the future, He gave the promise of two resurrections, to
wit, His own in the immediate future, and ours as yet to come in the end
of the world. “Because I live,” He says, “ye shall live also:” because
He liveth, therefore shall we live also. For as by man is death, by man
also is the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in
Christ shall all be made alive. <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) As it is only through the former
that every one is liable to death, it is only through Christ that any
one can attain unto life. Because we did not live, we are dead; because
He lived, we shall live also. We were dead to Him, when we lived to
ourselves; but, because He died in our behalf, He liveth both for
Himself and for us. For, because He liveth, we shall live also. For
while we were able of ourselves to attain unto death, it is not of
ourselves also that life can come into our possession.

<span id="iii.lxxvi-p9"></span>4. “In that day,” He says, “ye shall know
that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.” In what day, but in
that whereof He said, “Ye shall live also”? For then will it be that we
can see what we believe. For even now is He in us, and we in Him: this
we believe now, but then shall we also know it; although what we know
even now by faith, we shall know then by actual vision. For as long as
we are in the body, as it now is, to wit, corruptible, and encumbering
to the soul, we live at a distance from the Lord; for we walk by faith,
not by sight. <span id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md) Then
accordingly it will be by sight, for we shall see Him as He is. <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[1338](#fn_1337.md) For if Christ were not even now in
us, the apostle would not say, “And if Christ be in you, the body is
dead indeed because of sin; but the spirit is life because of
righteousness.” <span id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338.md) But that we
are also in Him even then, He makes sufficiently clear, when He says, “I
am the vine, ye are the branches.” <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md) Accordingly in that day, when we
shall be living the life, whereby death shall be swallowed up, we shall
know that He is in the Father, and we in Him, and He in us; for then
shall be completed that very state which is already in the present begun
by Him, that He should be in us, and we in Him.

<span id="iii.lxxvi-p14"></span>5. “He that hath my commmandments,” He
adds, “and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.” He that hath \[them\]
in his memory, and keepeth them in his life; who hath them orally, and
keepeth them morally; who hath them in the ear, and keepeth them in
deed; or who hath them in deed, and keepeth them by perseverance;—“he it
is,” He says, “that loveth me.” By works is love made manifest as no
fruitless application of a name. “And he that loveth me,” He says,
“shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest
myself to him.” But what is this, “I *will* love”? Is it as if He were
then only to love, and loveth not at present? Surely not. For how could
the Father love us apart from the Son, or the Son apart from the Father?
Working as They do inseparably, how can They love apart? <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340.md) But He said, “I will love him,” in
reference to that which follows, “and I will manifest myself to him.” “I
will love, and will manifest;” that is, I will love to the very extent
of manifesting. For this has been the present aim of His love, that we
may believe, and keep hold of the commandment of faith; but then His
love will have this for its object, that we may see, and get that very
sight as the reward of our faith: for we also love now, by believing in
that which we shall see hereafter; but then shall we love in the sight
of that which now we believe.
