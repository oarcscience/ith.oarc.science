<span id="iii.xxii-p2"></span><span id="iii.xxii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.xxii-p2.2"></span>Chapter V. 20–23</span>

<span id="iii.xxii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.xxii-p3.1"></span>Yesterday</span>, so far as the Lord
vouchsafed to bestow, we discussed with what ability we could, and
discerned according to our capacity, how the works of the Father and of
the Son are inseparable; and how the Father doeth not some, the Son
others, but that the Father doeth all things through the Son, as through
His Word, of which it is written, “All things were made by Him, and
without Him was nothing made.” Let us to-day look at the words that
follow. And of the same Lord let us pray for mercy, and hope that, if He
deem it meet, we may understand what is true; but if we should not be
able to do this, that we may not go into what is false. For it is better
not to know than to go astray; but to know is better than not to know.
Therefore, before all things, we ought to strive to know. Should we be
able, to God be thanks; but should we not be able meanwhile to arrive at
the truth, let us not go to falsehood. For we are bound to consider well
what we are, and what we are treating of. We are men bearing flesh,
walking in this life; and though now begotten again of the seed of the
Word of God, yet in Christ renewed in such manner that we are not yet
wholly rid of Adam. For truly our mortal and corruptible part that
weighs down the soul <span id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) shows
itself to be, and manifestly is, of Adam; but what in us is spiritual,
and raises up the soul, is of God’s gift and of His mercy, who has sent
His only Son to partake our death with us, and to lead us to His own
immortality. The Son we have for our Master, that we may not sin; and
for our defender, if we have sinned and have confessed, and been
converted; an intercessor for us, if we have desired any good of God;
and the bestower of it with the Father, because Father and Son is one
God. But He was speaking these things as man to men: God concealed, the
man manifest, that He might make them gods that are manifest men; and
the Son of God made Son of man, that He might make the sons of men sons
of God. By what skill of His wisdom He doeth this, we perceive in His
own words. For as a little one He speaks to little ones, but Himself
little in such wise that He is also great, and we little, but in Him
great. He speaks, in <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span
id="iii.xxii-Page_138"></span>deed as one cherishing and nourishing
children at the breast that grow by loving.

<span id="iii.xxii-p5"></span>2. He had said, “The Son cannot of Himself
do anything, but what He seeth the Father doing.” We, however,
understood it not that the Father doeth something separately, which when
the Son seeth, Himself also doeth something of the same kind, after
seeing His Father’s work; but when He said, “The Son cannot of Himself
do anything, but what He seeth the Father doing,” we understood it that
the Son is wholly of the Father—that His whole substance and His whole
power are of the Father that begat Him. But just now, when He had said
that He doeth in like manner these things which the Father doeth, that
we may not understand it to mean that the Father doeth some, the Son
others, but that the Son with like power doeth the very same which the
Father doeth, whilst the Father doeth through the Son, He went on, and
said what we have heard read to-day: “For the Father loveth the Son, and
showeth Him all things that Himself doeth.” Again mortal thought is
disturbed. The Father showeth to the Son what things Himself doeth;
therefore, saith some one, the Father doeth separately, that the Son may
be able to see what He doeth. Again, there occur to human thought, as it
were, two artificers—as, for instance, a carpenter teaching his son his
own art, and showing him whatever he doeth, that the son also may be
able to do it. “Showeth Him,” saith He, “all things that Himself doeth.”
Is it therefore so, that whilst He doeth, the Son doeth not, that He may
be able to see the Father do? Yet, certainly, “all things were made by
Him, and without Him was nothing made.” Hence we see how the Father
showeth the Son what He doeth, since the Father doeth nothing but what
He doeth through the Son. What hath the Father made? He made the world.
Hath He shown the world, when made, to the Son in such wise, that the
Son also should make something like it? Then let us see the world which
the Son made. Nevertheless, both “all things were made by Him, and
without Him was nothing made,” and also “the world was made by
Him.” <span id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) If the world was made by
Him, and all things were made by Him, and the Father doeth nothing save
by the Son, where doth the Father show to the Son what He doeth, if it
be not in the Son Himself, through whom He doeth? In what place can the
work of the Father be shown to the Son, as though He were doing and
sitting outside, and the Son attentively watching the Father’s hand how
it maketh? Where is that inseparable Trinity? Where the Word, of which
it is said that the same is “the power and the wisdom of God”? <span
id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) Where that which the Scripture saith
of the same wisdom: “For it is the brightness of the eternal
light?” <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md) Where what was said of
it again: “It powerfully reaches from the end even to the end, and
ordereth all things sweetly”? <span id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md)
Whatever the Father doeth, He doeth through the Son: through His wisdom
and his power He doeth; not from without doth He show to the Son what He
may see, but in the Son Himself He showeth Him what He doeth.

<span id="iii.xxii-p10"></span>3. What seeth the Father, or rather, what
doth the Son see in the Father, that Himself also may do? Perhaps I may
be able to speak it, but show me the man who can comprehend it; or
perhaps I may be able to think and not speak it; or perhaps I may not be
able even to think it. For that divinity excels us, as God excels men,
as the immortal excels a mortal, as the eternal excels the temporal. May
He inspire and endow us, and out of that fountain of life deign to bedew
and to drop somewhat on our thirst, that we may not be parched in this
wilderness! Let us say to Him, Lord, to whom we have learnt to say
Father. We make bold to say this, because Himself willed it; if only we
so live that He may not say to us, “If I am a Father, where is mine
honor? if I am Lord, where is my fear?” Let us then say to Him, “Our
Father.” To whom do we say, “Our Father”? To the Father of Christ. He,
then, who says “Our Father” to the Father of Christ, says to Christ,
what else but “Our Brother”? Not, however, as He is the Father of Christ
is He in like manner our Father; for Christ never so conjoined us as to
make no distinction between Him and us. For He is the Son equal to the
Father, the eternal Son with the Father, and co-eternal with the Father;
but we became sons through the Son, adopted through the Only-begotten.
Hence was it never heard from the mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ, when
speaking to His disciples, that He said of the supreme God His Father,
“Our Father;” but He said either “My Father” or “Your Father.” But He
said not “Our Father;” so much so, that in a certain place He used these
two expressions: “I go to my God,” saith He, “and to your God.” Why did
He not say, “Our God”? Further, He said, “My Father, and your Father;”
He said not, “Our Father.” He so joins as to distinguish, distinguishes
so as not to disjoin. He wills us to be one in Him, but the Father and
Himself one.

<span id="iii.xxii-p11"></span> <span id="page_139">p. 139</span> <span
id="iii.xxii-Page_139"></span>4. How much soever then we may understand,
and how much soever we may see, we shall not see as the Son seeth, even
when we shall be made equal with the angels. For we are something even
when we do not see; but what are we when we do not see, other than
persons not seeing? And that we may see, we turn to Him whom we may see,
and there is formed in us a seeing which was not before, although we
were in being. For a man *is* when not seeing; and the same, when he
doth see, is called a man seeing. For him, then, to see is not the same
thing as to be a man; for if it were, he would not be man when not
seeing. But since he is man when not seeing, and seeks to see what he
sees not, he is one who seeks, and who turns to see; and when he has
well turned and has seen, he becomes a man seeing, who was before a man
not seeing. Consequently, to see is to him a thing that comes and goes;
it comes to him when he turns to, and leaves him when he turns away. Is
it thus with the Son? Far be it from us to think so. It was never so
that He was Son, not seeing, and afterwards was made to see; but to see
the Father is to Him the same thing as to be Son. For we, by turning
away to sin, lose enlightenment; and by turning to God we receive
enlightenment. For the light by which we are enlightened is one thing;
we who are enlightened, another thing. But the light itself, by which we
are enlightened, neither turns away from itself, nor loses its lucidity,
because as light it exists. The Father, then, showeth a thing which He
doeth to the Son, in such wise that the Son *seeth* all things in the
Father, and *is* all things in the Father. For by seeing He was
begotten; and by being begotten He seeth. Not, however, that at any time
He was not begotten, and afterwards was begotten; nor that at any time
He saw not, and afterwards saw. But in what consists His seeing, in the
same consists His being, in the same His being begotten, in the same His
continuing, in the same His unchanging, in the same His abiding without
beginning and without end. Let us not therefore take it in a carnal
sense that the Father sitteth and doeth a work, and showeth it to the
Son; and the Son seeth the work that the Father doeth, and doeth another
work in another place, or out of other materials. For “all things were
made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.” The Son is the Word of
the Father. The Father said nothing which He did not say in the Son. For
by speaking in the Son what He was about to do through the Son, He begat
the Son through whom He made all things.

<span id="iii.xxii-p12"></span>5. “And greater works than these will He
show Him, that ye may marvel.” Here again we are embarrassed. And who is
there that may worthily investigate this so great a secret? But now, in
that He has deigned to speak to us, Himself opens it. For He would not
speak what He would not have us understand; and as He has deigned to
speak, without doubt He has excited attention: for does He forsake any
whom He has roused to give attentive hearing? We have said that it is
not in a temporal sense that the Son knoweth,—that the knowledge of the
Son is not one thing, and the Son Himself another; nor one thing His
seeing, Himself another; but that the seeing itself is the Son, and the
knowledge as well as the wisdom of the Father is the Son; and that that
wisdom and seeing is eternal and co-eternal with Him from whom it is;
that it is not something that varies by time, nor something produced
that was not in being, nor something that vanishes away which did exist.
What is it, then, that time does in this case, that He should say,
“Greater works than these He will show Him”? “He will show,” that is,
“He is about to show.” *Hath shown* is a different thing from *will
show: hath shown*, we say of an act past; *will show*, of an act future.
What shall we do here, then, brethren? Behold, He whom we had declared
to be co-eternal with the Father, in whom nothing is varied by time, in
whom is no moving through spaces either of moments or of places, of whom
we had declared that He abides ever with the Father seeing, seeing the
Father, and by seeing existing; He, I say, here again mentioning times
to us, saith, “He will show Him greater works than these.” Is He then
about to show something to the Son, which the Son doth not as yet know?
What, then, do we make of it? How do we understand this? Behold, our
Lord Jesus Christ was above, is beneath. When was He above? When He
said, “What things soever the Father doeth, these same also the Son
doeth in like manner.” Whence know we that He is now beneath? Hence:
“Greater works than these He will show Him.” O Lord Jesus Christ, our
Saviour, Word of God, by which all things were made, what is the Father
about to show Thee, that as yet Thou knowest not? What of the Father is
hid from Thee? What in the Father is hid from Thee, from whom the Father
is not hid? What greater works is He about to show Thee? Or greater than
what works are they which He is to show Thee? For when He said, “Greater
than these,” we ought first to understand the works than which are they
greater.

<span id="iii.xxii-p13"></span>6. Let us again call to mind whence this
discourse started. It was when that man <span id="page_140">p.
140</span> <span id="iii.xxii-Page_140"></span>who was thirty-eight
years in infirmity was healed, and Jesus commanded him, now made whole,
to take up his bed and to go to his house. For this cause, indeed, the
Jews with whom He was speaking were enraged. He spoke in words, as to
the meaning He was silent; hinted in some measure at the meaning to
those who understood, and hid the matter from them that were wroth. For
this cause, I say, the Jews, being enraged because the Lord did this on
the Sabbath, gave occasion to this discourse. Therefore let us not hear
these things in such wise as if we had forgotten what was said above,
but let us look back to that impotent man languishing for thirty-eight
years suddenly made whole, while the Jews marvelled and were wroth. They
sought darkness from the Sabbath more than light from the miracle.
Speaking then to these, while they are indignant, He saith, “Greater
works than these will He show Him.” “Greater than these:” than which?
What ye have seen, that a man, whose infirmity had lasted thirty-eight
years, was made whole; greater than these the Father is about to show to
the Son. What are greater works? He goes on, saying, “For as the Father
raiseth the dead, and quickeneth them, so also the Son quickeneth whom
He will.” Clearly these are greater. Very much greater is it that a dead
man should rise, than that a sick man should recover: these are greater.
But when is the Father about to show these to the Son? Does the Son not
know them? And He who was speaking, did He not know how to raise the
dead? Had He yet to learn how to raise the dead to life—He, I say, by
whom all things were made? He who caused that we should live, when we
were not in being, had He yet to learn how we might be raised to life
again? What, then, do His words mean?

<span id="iii.xxii-p14"></span>7. But now He condescends to us, and He
who a little before was speaking as God, now begins to speak as man.
Notwithstanding, the same is man who is God, for God was made man; but
was made what He was not, without losing what He was. The man therefore
was added to the God, that He might be man who was God, but not that He
should now henceforth be man and not be God. Let us then hear Him also
as our brother whom we did hear as our Maker. Our Maker, because the
Word in the beginning; our Brother, because born of the Virgin Mary:
Maker, before Abraham, before Adam, before earth, before heaven, before
all things corporeal and spiritual; but Brother, of the seed of Abraham,
of the tribe of Judah, of the Israelitish virgin. If therefore we know
Him who speaks to us as both God and man, let us understand the words of
God and of man; for sometimes He speaks to us such things as are
applicable to the majesty, sometimes such as are applicable to the
humility. For the selfsame is high who was made low, that He might make
us high who are low. What, then, saith He? “The Father will show” to me
“greater than these, that ye may marvel.” To us, therefore, He is about
to show, not to Him. And since it is to us that the Father is to show,
for that reason He said, “that ye may marvel.” He has, in fact,
explained what He meant in saying, “The Father will show” to me. Why did
He not say, The Father will show to you; but, He will show to the Son?
Because also we are members of the Son; and like as what we the members
learn, He Himself in a manner learns in His members. How doth He learn
in us? As He suffers in us. Whence may we prove that He suffers in us?
From that voice out of heaven, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
me?” <span id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) Is it not Himself that will
sit as Judge in the end of the world, and, setting the just on the
right, and the wicked on the left, will say, “Come, ye blessed of my
Father, receive the kingdom; for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat”?
And when they shall answer, “Lord, when saw we Thee hungry?” He will say
to them, “Since ye gave to one of the least of mine, ye gave to
me.” <span id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) Let us at this time
question Him, and let us say to Him, Lord, when wilt Thou be a learner,
seeing Thou teachest all things? Immediately, indeed, He makes answer to
us in our faith, When one of the least of mine doth learn, I learn.

<span id="iii.xxii-p17"></span>8. Let us rejoice, then, and give thanks
that we are made not only Christians, but Christ. Do ye understand,
brethren, and apprehend the grace of God upon us? Marvel, be glad, we
are made Christ. For if He is the head, we are the members: the whole
man is He and we. This is what the Apostle Paul saith: “That we be no
longer babes, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of
doctrine.” But above he had said, “Until we all come together into the
unity of faith, and to the knowledge of the Son of God, to the perfect
man, to the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ.” <span
id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) The fullness of Christ, then, is head
and members. Head and members, what is that? Christ and the Church. We
should indeed be arrogating this to ourselves proudly, if He did not
Himself deign to promise it, who saith by the same apostle, “But ye are
the body of Christ, and members.” <span
id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md)

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span> <span id="iii.xxii-Page_141"></span>

<span id="iii.xxii-p20"></span>9. Whenever, then, the Father showeth to
Christ’s members, He showeth to Christ. A certain great but yet real
miracle happens. There is a showing to Christ of what Christ knew, and
it is shown to Christ through Christ. A marvelous and great thing it is,
but the Scripture so saith. Shall we contradict the divine declarations?
Shall we not rather understand them, and of His own gift render thanks
to Him who freely bestowed it on us? What is this that I said, “is shown
to Christ through Christ”? Is shown to the members through the head. Lo,
look at this in thyself. Suppose that with thine eyes shut thou wouldest
take up something, thy hand knows not whither to go; and yet thy hand is
at any rate thy member, for it is not separated from thy body. Open
thine eyes, now the hand sees whither it may go; while the head showed,
the member followed. If, then, there could be found in thyself something
such, that thy body showed to thy body, and that through thy body
something was shown to thy body, then do not marvel that it is said
there is shown to Christ through Christ. For the head shows that the
members may see, and the head teaches that the members may learn;
nevertheless one man, head and members. He willed not to separate
Himself, but deigned to attach Himself to us. Far was He from us, yea,
very far. What so far apart as the creature and the Creator? What so far
apart as God and man? What so far as justice and iniquity? What so far
as eternity and mortality? Behold, so far from us was the Word in the
beginning, God with God, by whom all things were made. How, then, was He
made near, that He might be what we are, and we in Him? “The Word was
made flesh, and dwelt in (among) us.” <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md)

<span id="iii.xxii-p22"></span>10. This, then, He is about to show us;
this He showed to His disciples, who saw Him in the flesh. What is this?
“As the Father raiseth the dead, and quickeneth them, so also the Son
quickeneth whom He will.” Is it that the Father some, the Son others?
Surely all things were made by Him. What do we say, my brethren? Christ
raised Lazarus; what dead man did the Father raise, that Christ might
see how to raise Lazarus? When Christ raised Lazarus, did not the Father
raise him? or was it the doing of the Son alone, without the Father?
Read ye the passage itself, and see that He invokes the Father that
Lazarus may rise again. <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) As a
man, He calls on the Father; as God, He doeth with the Father. Therefore
also Lazarus, who rose again, was raised both by the Father and by the
Son, in the gift and grace of the Holy Spirit; and that wonderful work
the Trinity performed. Let us not, therefore, understand this, “As the
Father raiseth the dead, and quickeneth them, so also the Son quickeneth
whom He will,” in such wise as to suppose that some are raised and
quickened by the Father, others by the Son; but that the Son raiseth and
quickeneth the very same whom the Father raiseth and quickeneth; because
“all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.” And to
show that He has, though given by the Father, equal power, therefore He
saith, “So also the Son quickeneth whom He will,” that He might therein
show His will; and lest any should say, “The Father raiseth the dead by
the Son, but the Father as being powerful, and as having power, the Son
as by another’s power, as a servant does something, as an angel,” He
indicated His power when He saith, “So also the Son quickeneth whom He
will.” It is not so that the Father willeth other than the Son; but as
the Father and the Son have one substance, so also one will.

<span id="iii.xxii-p24"></span>11. And who are these dead whom the
Father and the Son quicken? Are they the same of whom we have
spoken—Lazarus, or that widow’s son, <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) or the ruler of the synagogue’s
daughter? <span id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) For we know that these
were raised by Christ the Lord. It is some other thing that He means to
signify to us,—namely, the resurrection of the dead, which we all look
for; not that resurrection which certain have had, that the rest might
believe. For Lazarus rose to die again; we shall rise again to live for
ever. Is it the Father that effects such a resurrection, or the Son? Nay
verily, the Father in the Son. Consequently the Son, and the Father in
the Son. Whence do we prove that He speaks of this resurrection? When He
had said, “As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, so
also the Son quickeneth whom He will.” Lest we should understand here
that resurrection which He performs for a miracle, not for eternal life,
He proceeded, saying, “For the Father judgeth not any man, but all
judgment hath He given to the Son.” What is this? He was speaking of the
resurrection of the dead, that “as the Father raiseth the dead, and
quickeneth them, so also the Son quickeneth whom He will;” and
immediately thereupon added as a reason, concerning the judgment,
saying, “for the Father judgeth not any man, but all judgment hath He
given to the Son.” Why said He this, but to indicate that He had spoken
of that resurrection of <span id="page_142">p. 142</span> <span
id="iii.xxii-Page_142"></span>the dead which will take place in the
judgment?

<span id="iii.xxii-p27"></span>12. “For,” saith He, “the Father judgeth
no man, but all judgment hath He given to the Son.” A little before we
were thinking that the Father doeth something which the Son doeth not,
when He said, “The Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things
that Himself doeth;” as though the Father were doing, and the Son were
seeing. In this way there was creeping in upon our mind a carnal
conception, as if the Father did what the Son did not; but that the Son
was looking on while the Father showed what He was doing. Then, as the
Father was doing what the Son did not, just now we see the Son doing
what the Father doeth not. How He turns us about, and keeps our mind
busy! He leads us hither and thither, will not allow us to remain in one
place of the flesh, that by changing He may exercise us, by exercising
He may cleanse us, by cleansing He may render us capable of receiving,
and may fill us when made capable. What have these words to do with us?
What was He speaking? What is He speaking? A little before, He said that
the Father showeth to the Son whatever He doeth. I did see, as it were,
the Father doing, the Son waiting to see; presently again, I see the Son
doing, the Father idle: “For the Father judgeth not any man, but all
judgment hath He given to the Son.” When, therefore, the Son is about to
judge, will the Father be idle, and not judge? What is this? What am I
to understand? What dost Thou say, O Lord? Thou art God the Word, I am a
man. Dost Thou say that “the Father judgeth not any man, but hath given
all judgment to the Son”? I read in another place that Thou sayest, “I
judge not any man; there is one who seeketh and judgeth.” <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) Of whom sayest Thou, “There is one who
seeketh and judgeth,” unless it be of the Father? He maketh inquisition
for thy wrongs, and judgeth for them. How is it to be understood here
that “the Father judgeth not any man, but all judgment hath He given to
the Son”? Let us ask Peter; let us hear him speaking in his epistle:
“Christ suffered for us,” saith he, “leaving us an example that we
should follow His steps; who did no sin, neither was guile found in His
mouth; who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered
wrong, He threatened not, but committed Himself to Him that judgeth
righteously.” <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) How is it true
that “the Father judgeth not any man, but hath given all judgment to the
Son”? We are here in perplexity, and being perplexed let us exert
ourselves, that by exertion we may be purified. Let us endeavor as best
we may, by His own gift, to penetrate the deep secrets of these words.
It may be that we are acting rashly, in that we wish to discuss and to
scrutinize the words of God. Yet why were they spoken, but to be known?
Why did they sound forth, but to be heard? Why were they heard, but to
be understood? Let Him greatly strengthen us, then, and bestow somewhat
on us so far as He may deem worthy; and if we do not yet penetrate to
the fountain, let us drink of the brook. Behold, John himself has flowed
forth to us like a brook, conveyed to us the word from on high. He
brought it low, and in a manner levelled it, that we may not dread the
lofty One, but may draw nigh to Him that is low.

<span id="iii.xxii-p30"></span>13. By all means there is a sense, a true
and strong sense, if somehow we can grasp it, in which “the Father
judgeth not any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son.” For this
is said because none will appear to men in the judgment but the Son. The
Father will be hidden, the Son will be manifest. In what will the Son be
manifest? In the form in which He ascended. For in the form of God He
was hidden with the Father; in the form of a servant, manifest to men.
Not therefore “the Father judgeth any man, but all judgment hath He
given to the Son:” only the manifest judgment, in which manifest
judgment the Son will judge, since the same will appear to them that are
to be judged. The Scripture shows us more clearly that it is the Son
that will appear. On the fortieth day after His resurrection He ascended
into heaven, while His disciples were looking on; and they hear the
angelic voice: “Men of Galilee,” saith it, “why stand ye gazing up into
heaven? This same that is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come
in like manner as ye have seen Him going into heaven.” <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) In what manner did they see Him go? In
the flesh, which they touched, which they handled, the wounds even of
which they proved by touching; in that body in which He went in and out
with them for forty days, manifesting Himself to them in truth, not in
falsity; not a phantom, or shadow, or ghost, but, as Himself said, not
deceiving them, “Handle and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones,
as ye see me have.” <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) That body is
now indeed worthy of a heavenly habitation, not being subject to death,
nor mutable by the lapse of ages. It is not as it had grown to that age
from infancy, so from the age of <span id="page_143">p. 143</span> <span
id="iii.xxii-Page_143"></span>manhood declines to old age: He remains as
He ascended, to come to those to whom He willed His word to be preached
before He comes. Thus will He come in human form, and this form the
wicked will see; both they on the right shall see it, and they that are
separated to the left shall see it: as it is written, “They shall look
on Him whom they pierced.” <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) If
they shall look on Him whom they pierced, they shall look on that same
body which they struck through with the spear; for a spear does not
pierce the Word. This body, therefore, will the wicked be able to look
on which they were able to wound. God hidden in the body they will not
see: after the judgment He will be seen by those who will be on the
right hand. This, then, is what He means when He saith, “The Father
judgeth not any man, but all judgment hath He given to the Son,”—that
the Son will come to judgment manifest, apparent to men in human body;
saying to those on the right, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, receive
the kingdom;” and to those on the left, “Go into everlasting fire, which
is prepared for the devil and his angels.” <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md)

<span id="iii.xxii-p35"></span>14. Behold, that form of man will be seen
by the godly and by the wicked, by the just and the unjust, by the
believers and unbelievers, by those that rejoice and by those that
mourn, by them that trusted and by them that are confounded: lo, seen it
will be. When that form shall have appeared in the judgment, and the
judgment shall have been finished, where it is said that the Father
judgeth not any, but hath given all judgment to the Son, for this
reason, that the Son will appear in the judgment in that form which He
took from us. What shall be after this? When shall be seen the form of
God, which all the faithful are thirsting to see? When shall be seen
that Word which was in the beginning, God with God, by which all things
were made? When shall be seen that form of God, of which the apostle
saith, “Being in the form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal
with God”? <span id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) For great is that
form, in which, moreover, the quality of the Father and Son is
recognized; ineffable, incomprehensible, most of all to little ones.
When shall this form be seen? Behold, on the right are the just, on the
left are the unjust; all alike see the man, they see the Son of man,
they see Him who was pierced, Him who was crucified they see: they see
Him that was made low, Him who was born of the Virgin, the Lamb of the
tribe of Judah they see. But when will they see the Word, God with God?
He will be the very same even then, but the form of a servant will
appear. The form of a servant will be shown to servants: the form of God
will be reserved for sons. Wherefore let the servants be made sons: let
them who are on the right hand go into the eternal inheritance promised
of old, which the martyrs, though not seeing, believed, for the promise
of which they poured out their blood without hesitation; let them go
thither and see there. When shall they go thither? Let the Lord Himself
say: “So those shall go into everlasting burning, but the righteous into
life eternal.” <span id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md)

<span id="iii.xxii-p38"></span>15. Behold, He has named eternal life.
Has He told us that we shall there see and know the Father and Son? What
if we shall live for ever, yet not see that Father and Son? Hear, in
another place, where He has named eternal life, and expressed what
eternal life is: “Be not afraid; I do not deceive thee; not without
cause have I promised to them that love me, saying, ‘He that hath my
commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that
loveth me, shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will
show myself to him.’” <span id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) Let us
answer the Lord, and say, What great thing is this, O Lord our God? What
great thing is it? Wilt Thou show Thyself to us? What, then, didst Thou
not show Thyself to the Jews also? Did not they see Thee who crucified
Thee? But Thou wilt show Thyself in the judgment, when we shall stand at
Thy right hand; will not also they who will stand on Thy left see Thee?
What is it that Thou wilt show Thyself to us? Do we, indeed, not see
Thee now when Thou art speaking? He makes answer: I will show myself in
the form of God; just now you see the form of a servant. I will not
deceive thee, O faithful man; believe that thou shall see. Thou lovest,
and yet thou dost not see: shall not love itself lead thee to see? Love,
persevere in loving; I will not disappoint thy love, saith He, I who
have purified thy heart. For why have I purified thy heart, but to the
end that God may be seen by thee? For “blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.”  <span id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) “But
this,” saith the servant, as if disputing with the Lord, “Thou didst not
express, when Thou didst say, ‘The righteous shall go into life
eternal;’ Thou didst not say, They shall go to see me in the form of
God, and to see the Father, with whom I am equal.” Observe what He said
elsewhere: “This is life eternal, that they may know Thee the one true
God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.” <span
id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md)

<span id="iii.xxii-p42"></span> <span id="page_144">p. 144</span> <span
id="iii.xxii-Page_144"></span>16. And immediately, then, after the
judgment mentioned, all which the Father, not judging any man, hath
given to the Son, what shall be? What follows? “That all may honor the
Son, even as they honor the Father.” The Jews honor the Father, despise
the Son. For the Son was seen as a servant, the Father was honored as
God. But the Son will appear equal with the Father, that all may honor
the Son, even as they honor the Father. This we have, therefore, now in
faith. Let not the Jew say, “I honor the Father; what have I to do with
the Son?” Let him be answered, “He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth
not the Father. Thou liest every way; thou blasphemest the Son, and dost
wrong to the Father. For the Father sent the Son, and thou despisest Him
whom the Father sent. How canst thou honor the sender, who blasphemest
the sent?”

<span id="iii.xxii-p43"></span>17. Behold, says some one, the Son has
been sent; and the Father is greater, because He sent. Withdraw from the
flesh; the old man suggests oldness in time. Let the ancient, the
perpetual, the eternal, to thee the new, call off thy understanding from
time to this. Is the Son less because He is said to have been sent? I
hear of a sending, not a separation. But yet, saith he, among men we see
that he who sends is greater than he who is sent. Be it so; but human
affairs deceive a man; divine things purge him. Do not regard things
human, in which the sender appears greater, the sent less;
notwithstanding, things human themselves bear testimony against thee.
Just as, for example, if a man wishes to ask a woman to wife, and, not
being able to do this in person, sends a friend to ask for him. And
there are many cases in which the greater is chosen to be sent by the
less. Why, then, wouldst thou now raise a captious objection, because
the one has sent, the other is sent? The sun sends out a ray, but does
not separate it; the moon sends out her sheen, but does not separate it;
a lamp sheds light, but does not separate it: I see there a sending
forth, not a separation. For if thou seekest examples from human things,
O heretical vanity, although, as I have said, even human things in some
instances refute thee, and convict of error; yet consider how different
it is in the case of things human, from which you wish to deduce
examples for things divine. A man that sends remains himself behind,
while only the man that is sent goes forward. Does the man who sends go
with him whom he sends? Yet the Father, who sent the Son, has not
departed from the Son. Hear the Lord Himself saying, “Behold, the hour
is coming, when every one shall depart to his own, and ye will leave me
alone; but I am not alone, because the Father is with me.” <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442.md) How has He, with whom He came, sent
Him? How has He, from whom He has not departed, sent Him? In another
place He said, “The Father abiding in me doeth the works.” <span
id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md) Behold, the Father is in Him, works in
Him. The Father sending has not departed from the Son sent, because the
sent and the sender are one.
