<span id="iii.lviii-p2"></span><span id="iii.lviii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lviii-p2.2"></span>Chapter XIII. 6–10</span>
(continued), and <span class="c10"><span id="iii.lviii-p2.3"></span>Song
of Sol. V. 2, 3</span>

<span id="iii.lviii-p3"></span>In what way the Church should fear to
defile her feet, while proceeding on her way to Christ.

<span id="iii.lviii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lviii-p4.1"></span>I Have</span> not been unmindful of my debt,
and acknowledge that the time of payment has now come. May He give me
wherewith to pay, as He gave me cause to incur the debt. For He has
given me the love, of which it is said, “Owe no man anything, but to
love one another.” <span id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144.md) May He
give also the word, which I feel myself owing to those I love. I put off
your expectations till now for this reason, that I might explain as I
could how it is we come to Christ along the ground, when we are
commanded rather to seek the things which are above, not the things
which are upon the earth. <span id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145.md) For
Christ is sitting above, at the right hand of the Father: but He is
assuredly here also; and for that reason said also to Saul, as he was
raging on the earth, “Why persecutest thou me?” <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146.md) But the topic on which we were
speaking, and which led to our entering on this inquiry, was our Lord’s
washing His disciples’ feet, after the disciples themselves had already
been washed, and needed not, save to wash their feet. And we there saw
it to be understood that a man is indeed wholly washed in baptism; but
while thereafter he liveth in this present world, and with the feet of
his human passions treadeth on this earth, that is, in his
life-intercourse with others, he contracts enough to call forth the
prayer, “Forgive us our debts.” <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147.md) And thus from these also is he
cleansed by Him who washed His disciples’ feet, <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148.md) and ceaseth not to make
intercession for us. <span id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149.md) And here
occurred the words of the Church in the Song of Songs, when she saith,
“I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?” when she wished to go
and open to that Being, fairer in form than the sons of men, <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150.md) who had come to her and knocked,
and asked her to open to Him. This gave rise to a question, which we
were unwilling to compress into the narrow limits of the time, and
therefore deferred till now, in what sense the Church, when on her way
to Christ, may be afraid of defiling her feet, which she had washed in
the baptism of Christ.

<span id="iii.lviii-p12"></span>2. For thus she speaks: “I sleep, but my
heart waketh: it is the voice of my Beloved <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151.md) that knocketh at the gate.” And
then He also says: “Open to me, my sister, my nearest, my dove, my
perfect one; for my head is filled with dew, and my hair with the drops
of the night.” And she replies: “I have put off my dress; how shall I
put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?” <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152.md) O wonderful sacramental symbol! O
lofty mystery! Does she, then, fear to defile her feet in coming to Him
who washed the feet of His disciples? Her fear is genuine; for it is
along the earth she has to come to Him, who is still on earth, because
refusing to leave His own who are stationed here. Is it not He that
saith, “Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world”? <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153.md) Is it not He that saith, “Ye shall
see the heavens <span id="page_303">p. 303</span> <span
id="iii.lviii-Page_303"></span>opened, and the angels of God ascending
and descending upon the Son of man”? <span
id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154.md) If they ascend to Him because He is
above, how do they descend to Him, but because He is also here?
Therefore saith the Church: “I have washed my feet; how shall I defile
them?” She says so even in the case of those who, purified from all
dross, can say: “I desire to depart, and to be with Christ; nevertheless
to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.” <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155.md) She says it in those who preach
Christ, and open to Him the door, that He may dwell by faith in the
hearts of men. <span id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156.md) In such she
says it, when they deliberate whether to undertake such a ministry, for
which they do not consider themselves qualified, so as to discharge it
blamelessly, and so as not, after preaching to others, themselves to
become castaways. <span id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157.md) For it is
safer to hear than to preach the truth: for in the hearing, humility is
preserved; but when it is preached, it is scarcely possible for any man
to hinder the entrance of some small measure of boasting, whereby the
feet at least are defiled.

<span id="iii.lviii-p20"></span>3. Therefore, as the Apostle James
saith, “Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak.” <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158.md) As it is also said by another man
of God, “Thou wilt make me to hear joy and gladness; and the bones Thou
hast humbled will rejoice.” <span id="fr_1159"></span>[1160](#fn_1159.md)
This is what I said: When the truth is heard, humility is preserved. And
another says: “But the friend of the bridegroom standeth and heareth
him, and rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice.” <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[1161](#fn_1160.md) Let us rejoice in the hearing that
comes from the noiseless speaking of the truth within us. For although,
when the sound is outwardly uttered, as by one that readeth; or
proclaimeth, or preacheth, or disputeth, or commandeth, or comforteth,
or exhorteth, or even by one that sings or accompanies his voice on an
instrument, those who do so may fear to defile their feet, when they aim
at pleasing men with the secretly active desire of human applause. Yet
the one who hears such with a willing and pious mind, has no room for
self-gratulation in the labors of others; and with no self-inflation,
but with the joy of humility, rejoices because of the Master’s words of
truth. Accordingly, in those who hear with willingness and humility, and
spend a tranquil life in sweet and wholesome studies, the holy Church
will take delight, and may say, “I sleep, and my heart waketh.” And what
is this, “I sleep, and my heart waketh,” but just I sit down quietly to
listen? My leisure is not laid out in nourishing slothfulness, but in
acquiring wisdom. “I sleep, and my heart waketh.” I am still, and see
that Thou art the Lord: <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161.md) for
“the wisdom of the scribe cometh by opportunity of leisure; and he that
hath little business shall become wise.” <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162.md) “I sleep, and my heart waketh:” I
rest from troublesome business, and my mind turns its attention to
divine concerns (*or* communications). <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163.md)

<span id="iii.lviii-p27"></span>4. But while the Church finds delightful
repose in those who thus sweetly and humbly sit at her feet, here is one
who knocks, and says: “What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in
light; and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the
house-tops.” <span id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164.md) It is His voice,
then, that knocks at the gate, and says: “Open to me, my sister, my
neighbor, my dove, my perfect one; for my head is filled with dew, and
my locks with the drops of the night.” As if He had said, Thou art at
leisure, and the door is closed against me: thou art caring for the
leisure of the few, and through abounding iniquity the love of many is
waxing cold. <span id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165.md) The night He
speaks of is iniquity: but His dew and drops are those who wax cold and
fall away, and make the head of Christ to wax cold, that is, the love of
God to fail. For the head of Christ is God. <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[1167](#fn_1166.md) But they are borne on His locks,
that is, their presence is tolerated in the visible sacraments; while
their senses never take hold of the internal realities. He knocks,
therefore, to shake off this quiet from His inactive saints, and cries,
“Open to me,” thou who, through my blood, art become “my sister;”
through my drawing nigh, “my neighbor;” through my Spirit, “my dove;”
through my word which thou hast fully learned in thy leisure, “my
perfect one:” open to me, go and preach me to others. For how shall I
get in to those who have shut their door against me, without some one to
open? and how shall they hear without a preacher? <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167.md)

<span id="iii.lviii-p32"></span>5. Hence it happens that those who love
to devote their leisure to good studies, and shrink from encountering
the troubles of toilsome labors, as feeling themselves unsuited to
undertake and discharge such services with credit, would prefer, were it
possible, to have the holy apostles and ancient preachers of the truth
again raised up against that abounding of iniquity which hath so reduced
the warmth of Christian love. But in regard to those who have already
left the body, and put off the garment of the flesh (for they are not
utterly parted), the Church replies, “I have put off my dress; how shall
I put it on?” That <span id="page_305">p. 305</span> <span
id="iii.lviii-Page_305"></span>dress shall, indeed, yet be recovered;
and in the persons of those who have meanwhile laid it aside, shall the
Church again put on the garment of flesh: only not now, when the cold
are needing to be warmed; but then, when the dead shall rise again.
Realizing, then, her present difficulty through the scarcity of
preachers, and remembering those members of her own who were so sound in
word and holy in character, but are now disunited from their bodies, the
Church says in her sorrow, “I have put off my dress; how shall I put it
on?” How can those members of mine, who had such surpassing power,
through their preaching, to open the door to Christ, now return to the
bodies which they have laid aside?

<span id="iii.lviii-p33"></span>6. And then, turning again to those who
preach, and gather in and govern the congregations of His people, and so
open as they can to Christ, but are afraid, amid the difficulties of
such work, of falling into sin, she says, “I have washed my feet; how
shall I defile them?” For whosoever offendeth not in word, the same is a
perfect man. And who, then, is perfect? Who is there that offendeth not
amid such an abounding of iniquity, and such a freezing of charity? “I
have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?” At times I read and hear:
“My brethren, be not many masters, seeing that ye shall receive the
greater condemnation: for in many things we offend all.” <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168.md) “I have washed my feet; how shall I
defile them?” But see, I rise and open. Christ, wash them. “Forgive us
our debts,” because our love is not altogether extinguished: for “we
also forgive our debtors.” <span id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169.md)
When we listen to Thee, the bones which have been humbled rejoice with
Thee in the heavenly places. <span id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170.md)
But when we preach Thee, we have to tread the ground in order to open to
Thee: and then, if we are blameworthy, we are troubled; if we are
commended, we become inflated. Wash our feet, that were formerly
cleansed, but have again been defiled in our walking through the earth
to open unto Thee. Let this be enough today, beloved. But in whatever we
have happened to offend, by saying otherwise than we ought, or have been
unduly elated by your commendations, entreat that our feet may be
washed, and may your prayers find acceptance with God.
