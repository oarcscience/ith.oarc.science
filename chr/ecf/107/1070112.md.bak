<span id="iii.cx-p2"></span><span id="iii.cx-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.cx-p2.2"></span>Chapter XVII. 20</span>.

<span id="iii.cx-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.cx-p3.1"></span>The</span> Lord Jesus, in the now close
proximity of His passion, after praying for His disciples, whom He also
named apostles, with whom He had partaken of that last supper from which
His betrayer had taken his departure on being revealed by the sop of
bread, and with whom, after the latter’s departure, and before beginning
His prayer in their behalf, He had already spoken at length, conjoined
all others also who were yet to believe on Him, and said to the Father,
“Neither pray I for these alone,” that is, for the disciples who were
with Him at the time, “but for them also,” He adds, “who shall believe
on me through their word.” Whereby He wished all His own to be
understood: not only such as were then in the flesh, but those also who
were yet to come. For all that have since believed on Him have doubtless
believed, and shall yet believe till He come, through the word of the
apostles; for to themselves He had said, “And ye also shall bear
witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning;” <span
id="fr_1740"></span>[1741](#fn_1740.md) and by them was the gospel
ministered even before it was written, and every one assuredly who
believeth on Christ believeth the gospel. Accordingly, those who He says
should believe on Him through their word, are not to be understood as
referring only to such as heard the apostles themselves while they lived
in the flesh; but others also after their decease, and we, too, born
long afterwards, have believed on Christ through their word. For they
that were then with Him preached to the others what they had heard from
Him; and so their word, that we too might believe, has found its way to
us, and wherever His Church exists, and shall yet reach down to
posterity, whoever and wherever they be who shall hereafter believe on
Him.

<span id="iii.cx-p5"></span>2. In this prayer, therefore, Jesus may seem
to have omitted praying for some of His own, unless we carefully examine
His words in the prayer itself. For if He prayed first for those, as we
have already shown, who were then with Him, and afterwards for those
also who should believe on Him through their word, it may be said that
He prayed not for those who were neither with Him when He so spake, nor
afterwards believed through their word, but had done so at some previous
time either of themselves, or in some other supposable manner. For was
Nathanael with Him at that time? <span
id="fr_1741"></span>[1742](#fn_1741.md) Was Joseph of Arimathea, who begged
His body from Pilate, and of whom this same evangelist John testifies
that he was already His disciple? <span
id="fr_1742"></span>[1743](#fn_1742.md) Were His mother, Mary, and other
women who, we know from the Gospel, had been prior to that time His
disciples? Were those with Him then, of whom this evangelist John
frequently says, “Many believed on Him”? <span
id="fr_1743"></span>[1744](#fn_1743.md) For whence came the multitude of
those who, with branches of trees, partly preceded and partly followed
Him as He sat on the ass, saying, “Blessed is He that cometh in the name
of the Lord;” and along with them the children of whom He Himself
declared that the prophecy had been uttered, “Out of the mouth of babes
and of sucklings Thou hast perfected praise”? <span
id="fr_1744"></span>[1745](#fn_1744.md) Whence the five hundred brethren,
to all of whom at once He would not have appeared after His
resurrection <span id="fr_1745"></span>[1746](#fn_1745.md) had they not
previously believed on Him? Whence that hundred and nine who, with the
eleven, were a hundred and twenty, when, being assembled together after
His ascension, they waited and received the promise of the Holy
Spirit? <span id="fr_1746"></span>[1747](#fn_1746.md) Whence came all
these, save from those of Whom it was said, “Many believed on Him”? For
them, therefore, the Saviour did not at this time pray, seeing it was
for those He prayed who were then with Him, and for others not who had
already, but who were yet to believe on Him through their word. But
these were certainly not with Him on that occasion, and had already
believed on Him at some previous period. I say nothing of the aged
Simeon, who believed on Him when an infant; of Anna the
prophetess; <span id="fr_1747"></span>[1748](#fn_1747.md) of Zachariah and
Elisabeth, who prophesied of Him before He was born of the Virgin; <span
id="fr_1748"></span>[1749](#fn_1748.md) of their son John, His forerunner,
the friend of the Bridegroom, who both recognized Him in the Holy
Spirit, and preached Him in His absence, and pointed Him out when He was
present to the <span id="page_407">p. 407</span> <span
id="iii.cx-Page_407"></span>recognition of others; <span
id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749.md) —I say nothing of these, as it
might be replied that He ought not to have prayed for such when dead,
who had gone hence with their great merits, and having met with a
welcome reception were now at rest; for a similar answer is also given
in connection with the righteous of olden time. For which of them could
have been saved from the damnation awaiting the whole mass of perdition,
which has been caused by one man, had he not believed, through the
revelation of the Spirit, in the one Mediator between God and men as yet
to come in the flesh? But behoved He to pray for the apostles, and not
to pray for so many who were still alive, but were not then with Him,
and had already at some previous period been brought to the faith? Who
is there that would say so?

<span id="iii.cx-p15"></span>3. We are therefore to understand that
their faith in Him was not yet such as He wished it to be, inasmuch as
even Peter himself, to whom, on making the confession, “Thou art the
Christ, the Son of the living God,” He had borne so excellent a
testimony, was disposed rather to hinder Him from dying than to believe
in His resurrection when dead, and hence was called immediately
thereafter by the same of Satan. <span
id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750.md) Those, accordingly, are found to be
the greater in faith who were long since deceased, and yet, through the
revelation of the Spirit, had no manner of doubt that Christ would rise
again, than those who, after attaining to the belief that He should
redeem Israel, at the sight of His death lost all the hope they
previously possessed regarding Him. The best thing for us, therefore, to
believe is, that after His resurrection, when the Holy Spirit was
bestowed, and the apostles taught and confirmed, and from its outset
constituted teachers in the Church, others, through their word, attained
the proper faith in Christ, or, in other words, that they then got firm
hold of the faith of His resurrection. And in this way also, that all
those who seemed to have already believed on Him really belonged to the
number of those for whom He prayed, when He said, “Neither pray I for
these alone, but for them also who shall believe on me through their
word.”

<span id="iii.cx-p17"></span>4. But we have still in reserve for the
further solution of this question the blessed apostle, and that robber
who was a villain in wickedness, but a believer on the cross. For the
Apostle Paul tells us that he was made an apostle not of men, nor by
man, but by Jesus Christ: and speaking of his own gospel, he says, “For
I neither received it of man, neither did I learn it, but by the
revelation of Jesus Christ.” <span id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751.md)
How then was he among those of whom it is said, “They shall believe on
me through their word”? On the other hand, the robber believed at the
very time when in the case of the teachers themselves such faith as they
previously possessed had utterly failed. Not even he, therefore,
believed on Christ through their word, and yet his faith was such that
he confessed that He whom he saw nailed to the cross would not only rise
again, but would also reign, when he said, “Remember me when Thou comest
into Thy kingdom.” <span id="fr_1752"></span>[1753](#fn_1752.md)

<span id="iii.cx-p20"></span>5. Accordingly it remains that if we are to
believe that the Lord Jesus, in this prayer, prayed for all of His own
who either then were or should thereafter be in this life, which is a
state of trial upon earth, <span id="fr_1753"></span>[1754](#fn_1753.md) we
must so understand the expression, “through their word,” as to believe
that it here signified the word of faith itself which they preached in
the world, and that it was called their word because it was primarily
and principally preached by them. For it was already in the course of
being preached by them in the earth when Paul received that same word of
theirs by the revelation of Jesus Christ. Whence also it came about that
he compared the Gospel with them, lest by any means he had run, or
should run, in vain; and they gave him their right hand because in him
also they found, although not given him by them, their own word which
they were already preaching, and in which they were now
established. <span id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754.md) And in regard to
this word of the resurrection of Christ, it is said by the same apostle,
“Whether it were I, or they, so we preach, and so ye believed;” <span
id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755.md) and again, “This is the word of
faith,” he says, “which we preach, that if thou shalt confess with thy
mouth that Jesus is the Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God
hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” <span
id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756.md) And in the Acts of the Apostles we
read that in Christ, God hath marked out \[the ground of\] faith unto
all men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead. <span
id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757.md) Accordingly, this word of faith,
because principally and primarily preached by the apostles who adhered
to Him, was called their word. Not, however, on that account does it
cease to be the word of God because it is called their word; for <span
id="page_408">p. 408</span> <span id="iii.cx-Page_408"></span>the same
apostle says that the Thessalonians received it from him “not as the
word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God.” <span
id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758.md) “Of God,” for the very reason that
it was freely given by God; but called “their word,” because primarily
and principally committed to them by God to be preached. In the same way
also the thief mentioned above had in the matter of his own faith their
word, which was called theirs precisely because the preaching of it
primarily and principally pertained to the office they filled. And once
more, when murmuring arose among the Grecian widows in reference to the
serving of the tables, previous to the time when Paul was brought to the
faith of Christ, the reply given by the apostles, who before then had
adhered to the Lord, was: “It is not good that we should leave the word
of God, and serve tables.” <span id="fr_1759"></span>[1760](#fn_1759.md)
Then it was that they provided for the ordination of deacons, that they
themselves might not be drawn aside from the duty of preaching the word.
Hence that was properly enough called their word which is the word of
faith, whereby all, from whatever quarter they had heard it, believed on
Christ, or, as yet to hear it, should thereafter believe. In this
prayer, therefore, all whom He redeemed, whether then alive or
thereafter to live in the flesh, were prayed for by our Redeemer when,
praying for the apostles who were then with Him, He also conjoined those
who were yet to believe on Him through their word. But what, after such
conjunction, He then proceeds to say, must be reserved for discussion in
another discourse.
