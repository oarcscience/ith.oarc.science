<span id="iii.cvii-p2"></span><span id="iii.cvii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.cvii-p2.2"></span>Chapter XVII. 6–8</span>.

<span id="iii.cvii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.cvii-p3.1"></span>In</span> this discourse we purpose speaking,
as He gives us grace, on these words of the Lord which run thus: “I have
manifested Thy name unto the men whom Thou gavest me out of the world.”
If He said this only of those disciples with whom He had supped, and to
whom, before beginning His prayer, He had said so much, it can have
nothing to do with that clarification, or, as others have translated it,
glorification, whereof He was previously speaking, and whereby the Son
clarifies or glorifies the Father. For what great glory, or what like
glory, was it to become known to twelve, or rather eleven mortal
creatures? But if, in saying, “I have manifested Thy name unto the men
whom Thou gavest me out of the world,” He wished all to be understood,
even those who were still to believe on Him, as belonging to His great
Church which was yet to be made up of all nations, and of which it is
said in the psalm, “I will confess to Thee in the great Church
\[congregation\];” <span id="fr_1714"></span>[1715](#fn_1714.md) it is
plainly that glorification wherewith the Son glorifies the Father, when
He makes His name known to all nations and to so many generations of
men. And what He says here, “I have manifested Thy name unto the men
whom Thou gavest me out of the world,” is similar to what He had said a
little before, “I have glorified Thee upon the earth”, ([John
17.4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004)<span id="iii.cvii-p4.2"></span>.md);
putting both here and there the past for the future, as One who knew
that it was predestinated to be done, and therefore saying that He had
done what He had still to do, though without any uncertainty, in the
future.

<span id="iii.cvii-p5"></span>2. But what follows makes it more credible
that His words, “I have manifested Thy name to the men whom Thou gavest
me out of the world,” were spoken by Him of those who were already His
disciples, and not of all who were yet to believe on Him. For after
these words, He added: “Thine they were, and Thou gavest them me; and
they have kept Thy word. Now they have known that all things, whatsoever
Thou hast given me, are of Thee: for I have given unto them the words
which Thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely
that I came out from Thee, and they have believed that Thou didst send
me.” Although all these words also might have been said of all believers
still to come, when that which was now a matter of hope had been turned
into fact, inasmuch as they were words that still pointed to the future;
yet we are impelled the more to understand Him as uttering them only of
those who were at that time His disciples, by what He says shortly
afterwards: “While I was with them, I kept them in Thy name: those that
Thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of
perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled” ([John
17.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.cvii-p5.1"></span>); meaning Judas, who betrayed Him, for He was
the only one of the apostolic twelve that perished. And then He adds,
“And now come I to Thee,” from which it is manifest that it was of His
own bodily presence that He said, “While I was with them, I kept them,”
as if already that presence were no longer with them. For in this way He
wished to intimate His own ascension as in the immediate future, when He
said, “And now come I to Thee:” going, that is, to the Father’s right
hand; whence He is hereafter to come to judge the quick and the dead in
the self-same bodily presence, according to the rule of faith and sound
doctrine: for in His spiritual presence He was still, of course, to be
with them after His ascension, and with the whole of His Church in this
world even to the end of time. <span
id="fr_1715"></span>[1716](#fn_1715.md) We cannot, therefore, rightly
understand of whom He said, “While I was with them, I kept them,” save
as those only who believed on Him, whom He had already begun to keep by
His bodily presence, but was now to leave without it, in order that He
might keep them with the Father by His spiritual presence. Thereafter,
indeed, He also unites with them the rest of His disciples, when He
says, “Neither pray I for these alone, but for those also who shall
believe on me through their word.” Where He shows still more clearly
that He was not speaking before of all who belonged to Him, in the
passage where He saith, “I have manifested Thy name unto the men whom
Thou gavest me,” but of those only who were listening to Him when He so
spake.

<span id="iii.cvii-p7"></span>3. From the very outset, therefore, of His
prayer, when “He lifted up His eyes to <span id="page_400">p. 400</span>
<span id="iii.cvii-Page_400"></span>heaven, and said, Father, the hour
is come; glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee,” on to
what He said a little afterwards, “And now, O Father, glorify Thou me
with Thine own self with the glory which I had with Thee before the
world was,” He wished all His disciples to be understood, to whom He
makes the Father known, and thereby glorifies Him. For after saying,
“That Thy Son may glorify Thee,” He straightway showed how that was to
be done, by adding, “As Thou hast given Him power over all flesh, that
He should give eternal life to as many as Thou hast given Him: and this
is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom Thou hast sent.” For the Father cannot be glorified through
any knowledge attained by men, unless He also be known by whom He is
glorified, that is to say, by whom He is made known to the nations of
the world. The glorification of the Father is not that which was
displayed in connection with the apostles only, but that which is
displayed in all men, of whom as His members Christ is the head. For the
words cannot be understood as applied to the apostles only, “As Thou
hast given Him power over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to
as many as Thou hast given Him;” but to all, assuredly, on whom, as
believing on Him, eternal life is bestowed.

<span id="iii.cvii-p8"></span>4. Accordingly, let us now see what He
says about those disciples of His who were then listening to Him. “I
have manifested,” He says, “Thy name unto the men whom Thou gavest me.”
Did they not, then, know the name of God when they were Jews? And what
of that which we read, “God is known in Judah; His name is great in
Israel”? <span id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716.md) Therefore, “I have
manifested Thy name unto *these* men whom Thou gavest me out of the
world,” and who are now hearing my words: not that name of Thine whereby
Thou art called God, but that whereby Thou art called my Father: a name
that could not be manifested without the manifestation of the Son
Himself. For this name of God, by which He is called, could not but be
known in some way to the whole creation, and so to every nation, before
they believed in Christ. For such is the energy of true Godhead, that it
cannot be altogether and utterly hidden from any rational creature, so
long as it makes use of its reason. For, with the exception of a few in
whom nature has become outrageously depraved, the whole race of man
acknowledges God as the maker of this world. In respect, therefore, of
His being the maker of this world that is visible in heaven and earth
around us, God was known unto all nations even before they were
indoctrinated into the faith of Christ. But in this respect, that He was
not, without grievous wrong being done to Himself, to be worshipped
alongside of false gods, God was known in Judah alone. But in respect of
His being the Father of this Christ, by whom He taketh away the sin of
the world, this name of His, previously kept secret from all, He now
made manifest to those whom the Father Himself had given Him out of the
world. But how had He done so, if the hour were not yet come, of which
He had formerly said that the hour would come, “when I shall no more
speak unto you proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of my
Father”? <span id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717.md) Can it be supposed
that the proverbs themselves contained such a plain anouncement? Why,
then, is it said, “I will declare to you openly,” but just because that
“in proverbs” is not “openly”? But when it is no longer concealed in
proverbs, but uttered in plain words, then without a doubt it is spoken
openly. How, then, had He manifested what He had not as yet openly
declared? It must be understood, therefore, in this way, that the past
tense is put for the future, like those other words, “All things that I
have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you:” <span
id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718.md) as something He had not yet done,
but spoke of as if He had, because His doing of it He knew to be
infallibly pre-determined.

<span id="iii.cvii-p12"></span>5. But what are we to make of the words,
“Whom Thou gavest me out of the world”? For it is said of them that they
were not of the world. But this they attained to by regeneration, and
not by generation. And what, also, of that which follows, “Thine they
were, and Thou gavest them me”? Was there a time when they belonged to
the Father, and not to His only-begotten Son; and had the Father once on
a time anything apart from the Son? Surely not. Nevertheless, there was
a time when God the Son had something, which that same Son as man
possessed not; for He had not yet become man of an earthly mother, when
He possessed all things in common with the Father. Wherefore in saying,
“Thine they were,” there is thereby no self-disruption made by God the
Son, apart from whom there was nothing ever possessed by the Father; but
it is His custom to attribute all the power He possesses to Him, of whom
He Himself is, who has the power. For of whom He has it that He is, of
<span id="page_401">p. 401</span> <span
id="iii.cvii-Page_401"></span>Him He has it that He is able; and both
together He always had, for He never had being without having ability.
Accordingly, what ever the Father could \[do\], always side by side with
Him could the Son; since He, who never had being without having ability,
was never without the Father, as the Father never was without Him. And
thus, as the Father is eternally omnipotent, so is the Son co-eternally
omnipotent; and if all-powerful, certainly all-possessing.  <span
id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719.md) For such rather, if we would speak
exactly, is the word by which we translate what is called by the Greeks
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.cvii-p13.1"></span> παντοκράτωρ</span>
which our writers would not interpret by the term omnipotent, seeing
that <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.cvii-p13.2"></span>
παντοκράτωρ</span> is all-possessing, were it not that they felt it to
be equivalent in meaning. What, then, could the eternal all-possessing
ever have, that the co-eternal all-possessing had not likewise? In
saying, therefore, “And Thou gavest them me,” He intimated that it was
as man He had received this power to have them; seeing that He, who was
always omnipotent, was not always man. Accordingly, while He seems
rather to have attributed it to the Father, that He received them from
Him, since all that is, is of Him, of whom He is; yet He also gave them
to Himself, that is, Christ, God with the Father, gave men to the
manhood of Christ, which had not its being with the Father. Finally, He
who says in this place, “Thine they were, and Thou gavest them me,” had
already said in a previous passage to the same disciples, “I have chosen
you out of the world.” <span id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720.md) Here,
then, let every carnal thought be crushed and annihilated. The Son says
that the men were given Him by the Father out of the world, to whom He
says elsewhere, “I have chosen you out of the world.” Those whom God the
Son chose along with the Father out of the world, the very same Son as
man received out of the world from the Father; for the Father had not
given them to the Son had He not chosen them. And in this way, as the
Son did not thereby set the Father aside, when He said, “I have chosen
you out of the world,” seeing that they were simultaneously chosen by
the Father also: as little did He thereby exclude Himself, when He said,
“Thine they were,” for they were equally also the property of the Son.
But now that same Son as man received those who belonged not to Himself,
because He also as God received a servant-form which was not originally
His own.

<span id="iii.cvii-p15"></span>6. He proceeds to say, “And they have
kept Thy word: now they have known that all things, whatsoever Thou hast
given me, are of Thee;” that is, they have known that I am of Thee. For
the Father gave all things at the very time when He begat Him who was to
have all things. “For I have given unto them,” He says, “the words which
Thou gavest me; and they have received them;” that is, they have
understood and kept hold of them. For the word is received when it is
perceived by the mind. “And they have known truly,” He adds, “that I
came out from Thee, and they have believed that Thou didst send me.” In
this last clause we must also supply “truly;” for when He said, “They
have known truly,” He intended its explanation by adding, “and they have
believed.” That, therefore, “they have believed truly” which “they have
known truly;” just as “I came out from Thee” is the same as “Thou didst
send me.” When, therefore, He said, “They have known truly,” lest any
might suppose that such a knowledge was already acquired by sight, and
not by faith, He subjoined the explanation, “And they have believed,” so
that we should supply “truly,” and understand the saying, “They have
known truly,” as equivalent to “They have believed truly:” not in the
way which He intimated shortly before, when He said, “Do ye now believe?
The hour cometh, and is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man
to his own, and shall leave me alone.”  <span
id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721.md) But “they have believed truly,”
that is, in the way it ought to be believed, without constraint, with
firmness, constancy, and fortitude: no longer now to go to their own,
and leave Christ alone. As yet, indeed, the disciples were not of the
character He here describes in words of the past tense, as if they were
so already, but as thereby declaring beforehand what sort they were yet
to be, namely, when they had received the Holy Spirit, who, according to
the promise, should teach them all things. For how was it, before they
received the Spirit, that they kept that word of His which He spake
regarding them, as if they had done so, when the chief of them thrice
denied Him, <span id="fr_1722"></span>[1723](#fn_1722.md) after hearing
from His lips the future fate of the man who denied Him before
men? <span id="fr_1723"></span>[1724](#fn_1723.md) He had given them,
therefore, as He said, the words which the Father gave Him; but when at
length they received them spiritually, not in an outward way with their
ears, but inwardly in their hearts, then they truly received them, for
then they truly knew them; and they truly knew them, because they truly
believed.

<span id="iii.cvii-p19"></span>7. But what human language will suffice
to <span id="page_402">p. 402</span> <span
id="iii.cvii-Page_402"></span>explain how the Father gave those words to
the Son? The question, of course, will appear easier if we suppose Him
to have received such words in His capacity as the Son of man. And yet,
although thus born of the Virgin, who will undertake to relate when and
how it was that He learned them, since even that very generation which
He had of the Virgin who will venture to declare? But if our idea be
that He received these words of the Father in His capacity as begotten
of, and co-eternal with, the Father, let us then exclude all such
thoughts of time as if He existed previous to His possessing them, and
so received the possession of that which He had not before; for whatever
God the Father gave to God the Son, He gave in the act of begetting. For
the Father gave those things to the Son without which He could not be
the Son, in the same manner as He gave Him being itself. For how
otherwise would He give any words to the Word, wherein in an ineffable
way He hath spoken all things? But now, in reference to what follows,
you must defer your expectations till another discourse.
