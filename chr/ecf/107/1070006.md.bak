<span id="iii.iv-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span

<span id="iii.iv-p2"></span><span id="iii.iv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.iv-p2.2"></span>Chapter I. 15–18</span>

<span id="iii.iv-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="iii.iv-p3.1"></span>We</span> undertook, in the name of the Lord,
and promised to you, beloved, to treat of that grace and truth of God,
full of which the only-begotten Son, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
appeared to the saints, and to show how, as a matter belonging to the
New Testament, it is to be distinguished from the Old Testament. Give,
then, your attention that what I receive in my measure from God you in
your measure may receive and hear the same. For it will only remain if,
when the seed is scattered in your hearts, the birds take it not away,
nor thorns choke it, nor heat scorch it, and there descend upon it the
rain of daily exhortations and your own good thoughts, by which that is
done in the heart which in the field is done by means of harrows, so
that the clod is broken, and the seed covered and enabled to germinate:
that you bear fruit at which the husbandman may be glad and rejoice. But
if, in return for good seed and good rain, you bring forth not fruit but
thorns, the seed will not be blamed, nor will the rain be in fault; but
for thorns due fire is prepared. <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md)

<span id="iii.iv-p5"></span>2. I do not think that I need spend much
time in endeavoring to persuade you that we are Christian men; and if
Christians, by virtue of the name, belonging to Christ. Upon the
forehead we bear His sign; and we do not blush because of it, if we also
bear it in the heart. His sign is His humility. By a star the Magi knew
Him; <span id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) and this sign was given by the
Lord, and it was heavenly and beautiful. He did not desire that a star
should be His sign on the forehead of the faithful, but His cross. By it
humbled, by it also glorified; by it He raised the humble, even by that
to which He, when humbled, descended. We belong, then, to the gospel, we
belong to the New Testament. “The law was given by Moses, but grace and
truth came by Jesus Christ.” We ask the apostle, and he says to us,
since we are not under the law but under grace. <span
id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) “He sent therefore His Son, made of a
woman, made under the law, that He might redeem those who were under the
law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.” <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) Behold, for this end Christ came, that He
might redeem those who were under the law; that now we may not be under
the law, but under grace. Who, then, gave the law? He gave the law who
gave likewise grace; but the law He sent by a servant, with grace He
Himself came down. And in what manner were men made under the law? By
not fulfilling the law. For he who fulfills the law is not under the
law, but with the law; but he who is under the law is not raised up, but
pressed down by the law. All men, therefore, being placed under the law,
are by the law made guilty; and for this purpose it is over their head,
that it may show sins, not take them away. The law then commands, the
Giver of the law showeth pity in that which the law commands. Men,
endeavoring by their own strength to fulfill that which the law
commands, fell by their own rash and headstrong presumption; and not
with the law, but under the law, became guilty: and since by their own
strength they were unable to fulfill the law, and were become guilty
under the law, they implored the aid of the Deliverer; and the guilt
which the law brought caused sickness to the proud. The sickness of the
proud became the confession of the humble. Now the sick confess that
they are sick; let the physician come to heal the sick.

<span id="iii.iv-p9"></span>3. Who is the Physician? Our Lord Jesus
Christ. Who is our Lord Jesus Christ? He who was seen even by those by
whom He was crucified. He who was seized, buffeted, scourged, spit upon,
crowned with thorns, suspended upon the cross, died, pierced by the
spear, taken down from the cross, laid in the sepulchre. That same Jesus
Christ our Lord, that same Jesus exactly, He is the complete Physician
of our wounds. That crucified One at whom insults were cast, and while
He hung on the cross His persecutors wagging the head, and saying, “If
he be the Son of God, let him come down from the cross,” <span
id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) —He, and no other, is our complete
Physician. Wherefore, then, did He not show to his deriders that He was
the Son of God; so that if He allowed Himself to be lifted up upon the
cross, at least when they said, “If he be the Son of God, let him come
down from the cross,” He should then come down, and show to them that He
was the very Son of God whom they had dared to deride? He would not.
Wherefore would He not? Was it because He could not? Manifestly <span
id="page_20">p. 20</span> <span id="iii.iv-Page_20"></span>He could. For
which is greater, to descend from the cross or to rise from the
sepulchre? But He bore with His insulters; for the cross was taken not
as a proof of power, but as an example of patience. There He cured thy
wounds, where He long bore His own; there He healed thee of death
eternal, where He vouchsafed to die the temporal death. And did He die,
or in Him did death die? What a death was that, which slew death!

<span id="iii.iv-p11"></span>4. Is it, however, our Lord Jesus Christ
Himself—His whole self—who was seen, and held, and crucified? Is the
whole very self that? It is the same, but not the whole, that which the
Jews saw; this is not the whole Christ. And what is? “In the beginning
was the Word.” In what beginning? “And the Word was with God.” And what
word? “And the Word was God.” Was then perhaps this Word made by God?
No. For “the same was in the beginning with God.” What then? Are the
other things which God made not like unto the Word? No: because “all
things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made.” In what
manner were all things made by Him? Because “that which was made in Him
was life;” and before it was made there was life. That which was made is
not life; but in the art, that is, in the wisdom of God, before it was
made, it was life. That which was made passes away; that which is in
wisdom cannot pass away. There was life, therefore, in that which was
made. And what sort of life, since the soul also is the life of the
body? Our body has its own life; and when it has lost it, the death of
the body ensues. Was then the life such as this? No; but “the life was
the light of men.” Was it the light of cattle? For this light is the
light of men and of cattle. There is a certain light of men: let us see
how far men differ from the cattle, and then we shall understand what is
the light of men. Thou dost not differ from the cattle except in
intellect; do not glory in anything besides. Dost thou presume upon thy
strength? By the wild beasts thou art surpassed. Upon thy swiftness dost
thou presume? By the flies thou art surpassed. Upon thy beauty dost thou
presume? How great beauty is there in the feathers of a peacock! Wherein
then art thou better? In the image of God. Where is the image of God? In
the mind, in the intellect. If then thou art in this respect better than
the cattle, that thou hast a mind by which thou mayest understand what
the cattle cannot understand; and therein a man, because better than the
cattle; the light of men is the light of minds. The light of minds is
above minds and surpasses all minds. This was that life by which all
things were made.

<span id="iii.iv-p12"></span>5. Where was it? Was it here? was it with
the Father, and was it not here? or, what is more true, was it both with
the Father and here also? If then it was here, wherefore was it not
seen? Because “the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness
comprehended it not.” Oh men, be not darkness, be not unbelieving,
unjust, unrighteous, rapacious, avaricious lovers of this world: for
these are the darkness. The light is not absent, but you are absent from
the light. A blind man in the sunshine has the sun present to him, but
is himself absent from the sun. Be ye not then darkness. For this is
perhaps the grace regarding which we are about to speak, that now we be
no more darkness, and that the apostle may say to us, “We were sometime
darkness, but now light in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) Because then the light of men was not
seen, that is, the light of minds, there was a necessity that a man
should give testimony regarding the light, who was not in darkness, but
who was already enlightened; and nevertheless, because enlightened, not
the light itself, “but that He might bear witness of the light.” For “he
was not that light.” And what was the light? “That was the true light
which enlightened every man that cometh into the world.” And where was
that light? “In this world it was.” And how was it “in this world?” As
the light of the sun, of the moon, and of lamps, was that light thus in
the world? No. Because “the world was made by Him, and the world knew
Him not;” that is to say, “the light shineth in darkness, and the
darkness comprehended it not.” For the world is darkness; because the
lovers of the world are the world. For did not the creature acknowledge
its Creator? The heavens gave testimony by a star; <span
id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) the sea gave testimony, and bore its Lord
when He walked upon it; <span id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) the winds
gave testimony, and were quiet at His bidding; <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) the earth gave testimony, and trembled
when He was crucified. <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) If all these
gave testimony, in what sense did the world not know Him, unless that
the world signifies the lovers of the world, those who with their hearts
dwell in the world? And the world is evil, because the inhabitants of
the world are evil; just as a house is evil, not because of its walls,
but because of its inhabitants.

<span id="iii.iv-p18"></span>6. “He came unto His own;” that is to say,
He came to that which belonged to Himself; “and His own received Him
not.” What, then, is the hope, unless that “as many <span
id="page_21">p. 21</span> <span id="iii.iv-Page_21"></span>as received
Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God”? If they become
sons, they are born; if born, how are they born? Not of flesh, “nor of
blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man; but of God
are they born.” Let them rejoice, therefore, that they are born of God;
let them believe that they are born of God; let them receive the proof
that they are born of God: “And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among
us.” If the Word was not ashamed to be born of man, are men ashamed to
be born of God? And because He did this, He cured us; and because He
cured us, we see. For this, “that the Word was made flesh, and dwelt
among us,” became a medicine unto us, so that as by earth we were made
blind, by earth we might be healed; and having been healed, might behold
what? “And we beheld,” he says, “His glory, the glory as of the
Only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.”

<span id="iii.iv-p19"></span>7. “John beareth witness of Him, and
crieth, saying, This was He of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is
made before me.” He came after me, and He preceded me. What is it, “He
is made before me”? He preceded me. Not was made before I was made, but
was preferred before me, this is “He was made before me.” Wherefore was
He made before thee, when He came after thee? “Because He was before
me.” Before thee, O John! what great thing to be before thee! It is well
that thou dost bear witness to Him; let us, however, hear Himself
saying, “Even before Abraham, I am.” <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) But Abraham also was born in the midst of
the human race: there were many before him, many after him. Listen to
the voice of the Father to the Son: “Before Lucifer I have begotten
Thee.” <span id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) He who was begotten before
Lucifer Himself illuminates all. A certain one was named Lucifer, who
fell; for he was an angel and became a devil; and concerning him the
Scripture said, “Lucifer, who did arise in the morning, fell.” <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) And why was he *Lucifer*? Because, being
enlightened, he gave forth light. But for what reason did he become
dark! Because he abode not in the truth. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) Therefore He was before Lucifer, before
every one that is enlightened; since before every one that is
enlightened, of necessity He must be by whom all are enlightened who can
be enlightened.

<span id="iii.iv-p24"></span>8. Therefore this follows: “And of His
fullness have all we received.” What have ye received? “And grace for
grace.” For so run the words of the Gospel, as we find by a comparison
of the Greek copies. He does not say, And of His fullness have all we
received grace for grace; but thus He says: “And of His fullness have
all we received, and grace for grace,”—that is, have we received; so
that He would wish us to understand that we have received from His
fullness something unexpressed, and something besides, grace for grace.
For we received of His fullness grace in the first instance; and again
we received grace, grace for grace. What grace did we, in the first
instance, receive? Faith: walking in faith, we walk in grace. How have
we merited this? by what previous merits of ours? Let not each one
flatter himself, but let him return into his own conscience, seek out
the secret places of his own thoughts, recall the series of his deeds;
let him not consider what he is if now he is something, but what he was
that he might be something: he will find that he was not worthy of
anything save punishment. If, then, thou wast worthy of punishment, and
He came not to punish sins, but to forgive sins, grace was given to
thee, and not reward rendered. Wherefore is it called grace? Because it
is bestowed gratuitously. For thou didst not, by previous merits,
purchase that which thou didst receive. This first grace, then, the
sinner received, that his sins were forgiven. What did he deserve? Let
him interrogate justice, he finds punishment; let him interrogate mercy,
he finds grace. But God promised this also through the prophets;
therefore, when He came to give what He had promised, He not only gave
grace, but also truth. How was truth exhibited? Because that was done
which had been promised.

<span id="iii.iv-p25"></span>9. What, then, is “grace for grace”? By
faith we render God favorable to us; and inasmuch as we were not worthy
to have our sins forgiven, and because we, who were unworthy, received
so great a benefit, it is called grace. What is grace? That which is
freely given. What is “freely given”? Given, not paid. If it was due,
wages were given, not grace bestowed; but if it was reply due, thou wast
good; but if, as is true, thou wast evil, but didst believe on Him who
justifieth the ungodly <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) (What is,
Who justifieth the ungodly? Of the ungodly maketh pious), consider what
did by right hang over thee by the law, and what thou hast obtained by
grace. But having obtained that grace of faith, thou shalt be just by
faith (for the just lives by faith); <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) and thou shalt obtain favor of God by
living by faith. And having obtained favor from God by living by faith,
<span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span id="iii.iv-Page_22"></span>thou
shalt receive immortality as a reward, and life eternal. And that is
grace. For because of what merit dost thou receive life eternal? Because
of grace. For if faith is grace, life eternal is, as it were, the wages
of faith: God, indeed, appears to bestow eternal life as if it were due
(To whom due? To the faithful, because he had merited it by faith); but
because faith itself is grace, life eternal also is grace for grace.

<span id="iii.iv-p28"></span>10. Listen to the Apostle Paul
acknowledging grace, and afterwards desiring the payment of a debt. What
acknowledgment of grace is there in Paul? “Who was before a blasphemer,
and a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained,” saith he,
“mercy.” <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) He said that he who
obtained it was unworthy; that he had, however, obtained it, not through
his own merits, but through the mercy of God. Listen to him now
demanding the payment of a debt, who had first received unmerited grace:
“For,” saith he, “I am now ready to be offered up, and the time of my
departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my
course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a
crown of righteousness.”  <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) Now he
demands a debt, he exacts what is due. For consider the following words:
“Which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall render unto me in that day.”
That he might in the former instance receive grace, he stood in need of
a merciful Father; for the reward of grace, of a just judge. Will He who
did not condemn the ungodly man condemn the faithful man? And yet, if
thou dost rightly consider, it was He who first gave thee faith, whereby
thou didst obtain favor; for not of thine own didst thou so obtain favor
that anything should be due to thee. Wherefore, then, in afterwards
bestowing the reward of immortality, He crowns His own gifts, not thy
merits. Therefore, brethren, “we all of His fullness have received;” of
the fullness of His mercy, of the abundance of His goodness have we
received. What? The remission of sins that we might be justified by
faith. And what besides? “And grace for grace;” that is, for this grace
by which we live by faith we shall receive another grace. What, then, is
it except grace? For if I shall say that this also is due, I attribute
something to myself as if to me it were due. But God crowns in us the
gifts of His own mercy; but on condition that we walk with perseverance
in that grace which in the first instance we received

<span id="iii.iv-p31"></span>11. “For the law was given by Moses;” which
law held the guilty. For what saith the apostle? “The law entered that
the offense might abound.” It was a benefit to the proud that the
offense abounded, for they gave much to themselves, and, as it were,
attributed much to their own strength; and they were unable to fulfill
righteousness without the aid of Him who had commanded it. God, desirous
to subdue their pride, gave the law, as if saying: Behold, fulfill, and
do not think that there is One wanting to command. One to command is not
wanting, but one to fulfill.

<span id="iii.iv-p32"></span>12. If, then, there is one wanting to
fulfill, whence does he not fulfill? Because born with the heritage of
sin and death. Born of Adam, he drew with him that which was there
conceived. The first man fell, and all who were born of him from him
derived the concupiscence of the flesh. It was needful that another man
should be born who derived no concupiscence. A man and a man: a man to
death and a man to life. Thus saith the apostle: “Since, indeed, by man
death, by man also the resurrection of the dead.” By which man death,
and by which man the resurrection of the dead? Do not make haste: he
goes on to say, “For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be
made alive.” <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) Who belong to Adam?
All who are born of Adam. Who to Christ? All who were born through
Christ. Wherefore all in sin? Because no one was born except through
Adam. But that they were born of Adam was of necessity, arising from
damnation; to be born through Christ is of will and grace. Men are not
compelled to be born through Christ: not because they wished were they
born of Adam. All, however, who are of Adam are sinners with sin: all
who are through Christ are justified, and just not in themselves, but in
Him. For in themselves, if thou shouldest ask, they belong to Adam: in
Him, if thou shouldest ask, they belong to Christ. Wherefore? Because
He, the Head, our Lord Jesus Christ, did not come with the heritage of
sin; but He came nevertheless with mortal flesh.

<span id="iii.iv-p34"></span>13. Death was the punishment of sins; in
the Lord was the gift of mercy, not the punishment of sin. For the Lord
had nothing on account of which He should justly die. He Himself says,
“Behold, the prince of this world cometh, and findeth nothing in me.”
Wherefore then dost Thou die? “But that all may know that I do the will
of my Father, arise, let us go hence.” <span
id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) He had not in Himself any reason why He
should die, and He died: thou hast such a reason, and <span
id="page_23">p. 23</span> <span id="iii.iv-Page_23"></span>dost thou
refuse to die? Do not refuse to bear with an equal mind thy desert, when
He did not refuse to suffer, to deliver thee from eternal death. A man
and a man; but the one nothing but man, the other God-man. The one a man
of sin, the other of righteousness. Thou didst die in Adam, rise in
Christ; for both are due to thee. Now thou hast believed in Christ,
render nevertheless that which thou owest through Adam. But the chain of
sin shall not hold thee eternally; because the temporal death of thy
Lord slew thine eternal death. The same is grace, my brethren, the same
is truth, because promised and manifested.

<span id="iii.iv-p36"></span>14. This grace was not in the Old
Testament, because the law threatened, did not bring aid; commanded, did
not heal; made manifest, but did not take away our feebleness: but it
prepared the way for that Physician who was to come with grace and
truth; as a physician who, about to come to any one to cure him, might
first send his servant that he might find the sick man bound. He was not
sound; he did not wish to be made sound and lest he should be made
sound, he boasted that he was so. The law was sent, it bound him; he
finds himself accused, now, he exclaims against the bandage. The Lord
comes, cures with somewhat bitter and sharp medicines: for He says to
the sick, Bear; He says, Endure; He says, Love not the world, have
patience, let the fire of continence cure thee, let thy wounds endure
the sword of persecutions. Wert thou greatly terrified although bound?
He, free and unbound, drank what He gave to thee; He first suffered that
He might console thee, saying, as it were, that which thou fearest to
suffer for thyself, I first suffer for thee. This is grace, and great
grace. Who can praise it in a worthy manner?

<span id="iii.iv-p37"></span>15. I speak, my brethren, regarding the
humility of Christ. Who can speak regarding the majesty of Christ, and
the divinity of Christ? In explaining and speaking of the humility of
Christ, to do so in any fashion we find ourselves not sufficient, indeed
wholly insufficient: we commend Him entire to your thoughts, we do not
endeavor to fill Him up to your hearing. Consider the humility of
Christ. But who, thou sayest, may explain it to us, unless thou declare
it? Let Him declare it within. Better does He declare it who dwelleth
within, than he who crieth without. Let Himself show to you the grace of
His humility, who has begun to dwell in your hearts. But now, if in
explaining and setting forth His humility we are deficient, who can
speak of His majesty? If “the Word made flesh” disturbs us, who shall
explain “In the beginning was the Word”? Keep hold then, brethren, upon
the entireness of Christ.

<span id="iii.iv-p38"></span>16. “The law was given by Moses: grace and
truth came by Jesus Christ.” By a servant was the law given, and made
men guilty: by an Emperor was pardon given, and delivered the guilty.
“The law was given by Moses.” Let not the servant attribute to himself
more than was done through him. Chosen to a great ministry as one
faithful in his house, but yet a servant, he is able to act according to
the law, but cannot release from the guilt of the law. “The law,” then,
“was given by Moses: grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.”

<span id="iii.iv-p39"></span>17. And lest, perhaps, any one should say,
And did not grace and truth come through Moses, who saw God, immediately
he adds, “No one hath seen God at any time.” And how did God become
known to Moses? Because the Lord revealed Himself to His servant. What
Lord? The same Christ, who sent the law beforehand by His servant, that
He might Himself come with grace and truth. “For no one hath seen God at
any time.” And whence did He appear to that servant as far as he was
able to receive Him? But “the Only-begotten,” he says, “who is in the
bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.” What signifieth “in the bosom
of the Father?” In the secret of the Father. For God has not a bosom, as
we have, in our garments, nor is He to be thought of sitting, as we do,
nor is He girt with a girdle so as to have a bosom; but because our
bosom is within, the secret of the Father is called the bosom of the
Father. And He who knew the Father, being in the secret of the Father,
He declared Him. “For no man hath seen God at any time.” He then came
and narrated whatever He saw. What did Moses see? Moses saw a cloud, he
saw an angel, he saw a fire. All that is the creature: it bore the type
of its Lord, but did not manifest the presence of the Lord Himself. For
thou hast it plainly stated in the law: “And Moses spake with the Lord
face to face, as a friend with his friend.” <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) Following the same scripture, thou
findest Moses saying: “If I have found grace in Thy sight, show me
Thyself plainly, that I may see Thee.” And it is little that he said
this: he received the reply, “Thou canst not see my face.” An angel then
spake with Moses, my brethren, bearing the type of the Lord; and all
those things which were done by the angel promised that future grace and
truth. Those who <span id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span
id="iii.iv-Page_24"></span>examine the law well know this; and when we
have opportunity to speak somewhat of this matter also, we shall not
fail to speak to you, beloved brethren, as far as the Lord may reveal to
us.

<span id="iii.iv-p41"></span>18. But know this, that all those things
which were seen in bodily form were not that substance of God. For we
saw those things with the eyes of the flesh: how is the substance of God
seen? Interrogate the Gospel: “Blessed are the pure in heart; for they
shall see God.” <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) There have been men
who, deceived by the vanity of their hearts, have said, The Father is
invisible, but the Son is visible. How visible? If on account of His
flesh, because He took flesh, the matter is manifest. For of those who
saw the flesh of Christ, some believed, some crucified; and those who
believed doubted when He was crucified; and unless they had touched the
flesh after the resurrection, their faith would not have been recalled.
If, then, on account of His flesh the Son was visible, that we also
grant, and it is the Catholic faith; but if before He took flesh, as
they say, that is, before He became incarnate, they are greatly deluded,
and grievously err. For those visible and bodily appearances took place
though the creature, in which a type might be exhibited: not in any
fashion was the substance itself shown and made manifest. Give heed,
beloved brethren, to this easy proof. The wisdom of God cannot be beheld
by the eyes. Brethren, if Christ is the Wisdom of God and the Power of
God; <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) if Christ is the Word of God,
and if the word of man is not seen with the eyes, can the Word of God be
so seen?

<span id="iii.iv-p44"></span>19. Expel, therefore, from your hearts
carnal thoughts, that you may be really under grace, that you may belong
to the New Testament. Therefore is life eternal promised in the New
Testament. Read the Old Testament, and see that the same things were
enjoined upon a people yet carnal as upon us. For to worship one God is
also enjoined upon us. “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God
in vain” is also enjoined upon us, which is the second commandment.
“Observe the Sabbath-day” is enjoined on us more than on them, because
it is commanded to be spiritually observed. For the Jews observe the
Sabbath in a servile manner, using it for luxuriousness and drunkenness.
How much better would their women be employed in spinning wool than in
dancing on that day in the balconies? God forbid, brethren, that we
should call that an observance of the Sabbath. The Christian observes
the Sabbath spiritually, abstaining from servile work. For what is it to
abstain from servile work? From sin. And how do we prove it? Ask the
Lord. “Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.” <span
id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) Therefore is the spiritual observance of
the Sabbath enjoined upon us. Now all those commandments are more
enjoined on us, and are to be observed: “Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt
not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false
witness. Honor thy father and thy mother. Thou shalt not covet thy
neighbor’s goods. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife.” <span
id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66.md) Are not all these things enjoined upon us
also? But ask what is the reward, and thou wilt find it there said:
“That thine enemies may be driven forth before thy face, and that you
may receive the land which God promised to your fathers.” <span
id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md) Because they were not able to comprehend
invisible things, they were held by the visible. Wherefore held? Lest
they should perish altogether, and slip into idol-worship. For they did
this, my brethren, as we read, forgetful of the great miracles which God
performed before their eyes. The sea was divided; a way was made in the
midst of the waves; their enemies following, were covered by the same
waves through which they passed: <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md)
and yet when Moses, the man of God, had departed from their sight, they
asked for an idol, and said, “Make us gods to go before us; for this man
has deserted us.” Their whole hope was placed in man, not in God.
Behold, the man is dead: was God dead who had rescued them from the land
of Egypt? And when they had made to themselves the image of a calf, they
offered it adoration, and said, “These be thy gods, O Israel, which
delivered thee out of the land of Egypt.”  <span
id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) How soon forgetful of such manifest
grace! By what means could such a people be held except by carnal
promises?

<span id="iii.iv-p50"></span>20. The same things are commanded in the
Decalogue as we are commanded to observe; but the same promises are not
made as to us. What is promised to us? Life eternal. “And this is life
eternal, that they know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom
Thou hast sent.” <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) The knowledge of
God is promised: that is, grace for grace. Brethren, we now believe, we
do not see; for faith the reward will be to see what we believe. The
prophets knew this, but it was concealed before He came. For a certain
lover sighing, says in the Psalms: “One thing have I desired of the
Lord, that will <span id="page_25">p. 25</span> <span
id="iii.iv-Page_25"></span>I seek after.” And dost thou ask what he
seeks? For perhaps he seeks a land flowing with milk and honey carnally,
although this is to be spiritually sought and desired; or perhaps the
subjection of his enemies, or the death of foes, or the power and riches
of this world. For he glows with love, and sighs greatly, and burns and
pants. Let us see what he desires: “One thing have I desired of the
Lord, that will I seek after.” What is it that he doth seek after? “That
I may dwell,” saith he, “in the house of the Lord all the days of my
life.” And suppose that thou dwellest in the house of the Lord, from
what source will thy joy there be derived? “That I may behold,” saith
he, “the beauty of the Lord.” <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md)

<span id="iii.iv-p53"></span>21. My brethren, wherefore do you cry out,
wherefore do you exult, wherefore do you love, unless that a spark of
this love is there? What do you desire? I ask you. Can it be seen with
the eyes? Can it be touched? Is it some fairness which delights the
eyes? Are not the martyrs vehemently beloved; and when we commemorate
them do we not burn with love? What is it that we love in them,
brethren? Limbs torn by wild beasts? What is more revolting if thou
askest the eyes of the flesh? what more fair if thou askest the eyes of
the heart? How appears in your eyes a very fair young man who is a
thief? How shocked are your eyes! Are the eyes of the flesh shocked? If
you interrogate them, nothing is more shapely and better formed than
that body; the symmetry of the limbs and the beauty of the color attract
the eyes; and yet, when thou hearest that he is a thief, your mind
recoils from the man. Thou beholdest on the other hand a bent old man,
leaning upon a staff, scarcely moving himself, ploughed all over with
wrinkles. Thou hearest that he is just: thou lovest and embracest him.
Such are the rewards promised to us, my brethren: love such, sigh after
such a kingdom, desire such a country, if you wish to arrive at that
with which our Lord came, that is, at grace and truth. But if you covet
bodily rewards from God, thou art still under the law, and therefore
thou shalt not fulfill the law. For when thou seest those temporal
things granted to those who offend God, thy steps falter, and thou
sayest to thyself: Behold, I worship God, daily I run to church, my
knees are worn with prayers, and yet I am constantly sick: there are men
who commit murders, who are guilty of robberies, and yet they exult and
have abundance; it is well with them. Was it such things that thou
soughtest from God? Surely thou didst belong to grace. If, therefore,
God gave to thee grace, because He gave freely, love freely. Do not for
the sake of reward love God; let Him be the reward. Let thy soul say,
“One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I
may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, that I may
behold the beauty of the Lord.” Do not fear that thine enjoyment will
fail through satiety: such will be that enjoyment of beauty that it will
ever be present to thee, and thou shalt never be satisfied; indeed thou
shalt be always satisfied, and yet never satisfied. For if I shall say
that thou shalt not be satisfied, it will mean famine; and if I shall
say thou shalt be satisfied, I fear satiety: where neither satiety nor
famine are, I know not what to say; but God has that which He can
manifest to those who know not how to express it, yet believe that they
shall receive.
