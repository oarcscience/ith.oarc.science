id="ii-p1.1"></span>Preface.</span>

<span id="ii-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="ii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> was an indefatigable preacher. He
considered regular preaching an indispensable part of the duty of a
bishop. To his homilies we owe most of his exegetical labors. The
homilies were delivered *extempore*, taken down by scribes and slightly
revised by Augustin. They retain their colloquial form, devotional tone,
frequent repetitions, and want of literary finish. He would rather be
deficient in rhetoric than not be understood by the people. He was
cheered by the eager attention and acclamations of his hearers, but
never fully satisfied with his performance. “My preaching,” he says,
“almost always displeases me. I eagerly long for something better, of
which I often have an inward enjoyment in my thoughts before I can put
them into audible words. Then when I find that my power of expression is
not equal to my inner apprehension, I am grieved at the inability of my
tongue to answer to my heart” (*De Catech. Rudibus*, ch. II. 3, in this
Series, Vol. III. 284). His chief merit as an interpreter is his
profound theological insight, which makes his exegetical works
permanently useful. Comp. the introductory essay in the sixth volume.

<span id="ii-p3"></span>This volume contains:

<span id="ii-p4"></span>I. The Homilies or Tractates on the <span
class="c10"><span id="ii-p4.1"></span>Gospel of John</span> (*In Joannis
Evangelium Tractatus CXXIV)*. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) Augustin
delivered them to his flock at Hippo about <span class="c10"><span
id="ii-p5.1"></span> A.D.</span> 416 or later. The Latin text is in the
third Tome of the Benedictine edition (in Migne’s reprint, Tom. III.
Part II. fol. 1379–1976). The first English translation appeared in the
Oxford “Library of Fathers of the Holy Catholic Church,” Oxford, 1848,
in 2 Vols., and was prepared by Rev. H. Browne, M. A., of Corpus Christi
College, Cambridge. The present translation was made jointly by Rev.
John Gibb, D.D., Professor in the Presbyterian Theological College at
London (Vol. I., Tractates 1–37), and Rev. James Innes, of Panbride,
near Dundee, Scotland (Vol. II., Tractates 38 to 124), for Dr. Dods’
Series of Augustin’s Works, published by T. & T. Clark, Edinburgh, 1873.
Dr. Gibb was requested to revise it, but did not deem it necessary. The
Indices of topics and texts are added to the American edition.

<span id="ii-p6"></span>II. The Homilies on the <span class="c10"><span
id="ii-p6.1"></span> First Epistle of John</span> (*In Epistolam Joannis
ad Parthos* <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) *Tractatus decem*.md) were
preached about the same time as those on the Gospel, or shortly after
<span id="page_iv">p. iv</span> <span id="ii-Page_iv"></span>wards. They
are also included in the third volume of the Benedictine edition (Migne,
T. III. P. II. 1977–2062). The translation by Rev. H. Browne is taken
from the Oxford Library of the Fathers (Clark’s edition has none), and
was slightly revised and edited with additional notes and an
introduction by the Rev. Dr. Myers, of Washington.

<span id="ii-p8"></span>III. The <span class="c10"><span
id="ii-p8.1"></span> Soliloquies</span> (in Vol. I., 869–905, Migne’s
ed.) were translated for this Library by the Rev. C. C. Starbuck, of
Andover, Mass. They were written by Augustin shortly after his
conversion (387), and are here added as a specimen of his earliest
philosophical writings. Neither the Oxford nor the Clark Series give
them a place. King Alfred translated parts of the <span
class="c10"><span id="ii-p8.2"></span>Soliloquies</span> into the
Anglo-Saxon of his day, and a partial translation appeared in 1631, but
I have not seen it.

<span id="ii-p9"></span>This volume completes Augustin’s exegetical
writings on the New Testament. The eighth and last volume will contain
his Homilies on the Psalms, as translated for the Oxford Library, and
edited by Bishop Coxe. It will be ready for publication in July of this
year.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[iii:1](1070001.htm#fr_0.md) <span
id="ii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="ii-p5"></span> The manuscripts vary in their headings between
*Tractatus, Sermones,* and *Homiliæ*. In three copies used by the
Benedictine editors the title is thus given: “*Aurelii Augustini
Doctoris Hippon. Episc. Homiliæ in Evangelium Dom. Jesu secundum Joannem
incipiunt, quas ipse colloqendo prius ad populum habuit, et inter
loquendum a notariis exceptas, eo quo habitæ sunt ordine, verbum ex
verbo postea dictavit.*”—Migne III. II. 1378.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[iii:2](1070001.htm#fr_1.md) <span
id="ii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="ii-p7"></span> *Ad Parthos*is a mistake which is found also in
some <span class="c10"><span id="ii-p7.1"></span>mss.</span> of the
Vulgate and has led to different conjectures. See note to the Prologue,
and Critical Introductions to the N.T., *e.g.* that of Weiss (1886), p.
468. He favors the conjecture <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii-p7.2"></span>πρὸς παρθένους</span>, *ad virgines*, which Clement
of Alex. gives as the superscription to the second Epistle of John.
Others conjecture <span class="Greek"><span id="ii-p7.3"></span>τοῦ
παρθένου</span>, (*virginis*), or *Ad sparsos*, etc.
