<span id="iii.xciv-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.xciv-p1.1"></span>Tractate XCIII.</span>

<span id="iii.xciv-p2"></span><span id="iii.xciv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.xciv-p2.2"></span>Chapter XVI. 1–4</span>.

<span id="iii.xciv-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.xciv-p3.1"></span>In</span> the words preceding this chapter of
the Gospel, the Lord strengthened His disciples to endure the hatred of
their enemies, and prepared them also by His own example to become the
more courageous in imitating Him: adding the promise, that the Holy
Spirit should come to bear witness of Him, and also that they themselves
could become His witnesses, through the effectual working of His Spirit
in their hearts. For such is His meaning when He saith, “He shall bear
witness of me, and ye also shall bear witness.” That is to say, because
He shall bear witness, ye also shall bear witness: He in your hearts,
you in your voices; He by inspiration, you by utterance: that the words
might be fulfilled, “Their sound hath gone forth into all the
earth.” <span id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md) For it would have
been to little purpose to have exhorted them by His example, had He not
also filled them with His Spirit. Just as we see that the Apostle Peter,
after having heard His words, when He said, “The servant is not greater
than his lord: if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute
you;” <span id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md) and seen that already
fulfilled in Him, wherein, had example been sufficient, he ought to have
imitated the patient endurance of his Lord, yet succumbed and fell into
denial, as utterly unable to bear what He saw his Master enduring. But
when he really received the gift of the Holy Spirit, he preached Him
whom he had denied; and whom he had been afraid to confess, he had no
fear now in openly proclaiming. Already, indeed, had he been
sufficiently taught by example to know what was proper to be done; but
not yet was he inspired with the power to do what he knew: he had got
instruction to stand, but not the strength to keep him from falling. But
after this was supplied by the Holy Spirit, he preached Christ even to
the death, whom, in his fear of death, he had previously denied. And so
the Lord in this succeeding chapter, on which we have now to address
you, saith, “These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
offended.” As it is sung in the psalm, “Great peace have they who love
Thy law, and nothing shall offend them.” <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) Properly enough, therefore, with
the promise of the Holy Spirit, by whose operation in their hearts they
should be made His witnesses, He added, “These things have I spoken unto
you, that ye should not be offended.” For when the love of God is shed
abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given unto us, <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md) they have great peace who love
God’s law, so that nothing may offend them.

<span id="iii.xciv-p8"></span>2. And then He expressly declares what
they were to suffer: “They shall put you out of the synagogues.” But
what harm was it for the apostles to be expelled from the Jewish
synagogues, as if they were not to separate themselves therefrom,
although no one expelled them? Doubtless He meant to announce with
reprobation, that the Jews would refuse to receive Christ, from whom
they as certainly would refuse to withdraw; and so it would come to pass
that the latter, who could not exist without Him, would also be cast out
along with Him by those who would not have Him as their place of abode.
For certainly, as there was no other people of God than that seed of
Abraham, they would, had they only acknowledged and received Christ,
have remained as the natural branches in the olive tree; <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md) nor would the churches of Christ
have been different from the synagogues of the Jews, for they would have
been one and the same, had they also desired to abide in Him. But having
refused, what remained but that, <span id="page_365">p. 365</span> <span
id="iii.xciv-Page_365"></span>continuing themselves out of Christ, they
put out of the synagogues those who would not abandon Christ? For having
received the Holy Spirit, and so become His witnesses, they would
certainly not belong to the class of whom it is said: “Many of the chief
rulers of the Jews believed on Him; but for fear of the Jews they dared
not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for they
loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.” <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) And so they believed on Him, but
not in the way He wished them to believe when He said: “How can ye
believe, who expect honor one of another, and seek not the honor that
cometh from God only?” <span id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md) It is,
therefore, with those disciples who so believe in Him, that, filled with
the Holy Spirit, or, in other words, with the gift of divine grace, they
no longer belong to those who, “ignorant of the righteousness of God,
and going about to establish their own, have not submitted themselves to
the righteousness of God;” <span id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md)
nor to those of whom it is said, “They loved the praise of men more than
the praise of God:” that the prophecy harmonizes, which finds its
fulfillment in their own case: “They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of
Thy countenance: and in Thy name shall they rejoice all the day; and in
Thy righteousness shall they be exalted: for Thou art the glory of their
strength.” <span id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md) Rightly enough is
it said to such, “They shall cast you out of the synagogues;” that is,
they who “have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge;” because,
“ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their
own,” <span id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md) they expel those who
are exalted, not in their own righteousness, but in God’s, and have no
cause to be ashamed at being expelled by men, since He is the glory of
their strength.

<span id="iii.xciv-p15"></span>3. Finally, to what He had thus told
them, He added the words: “But the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth
you will think that he doeth God service: and these things will they do
unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.” That is to
say, they have not known the Father, nor His Son, to whom they think
they will be doing service in slaying you. Words which the Lord added in
the way of consolation to His own, who should be driven out of the
Jewish synagogues. For it is in thus announcing beforehand what evils
they would have to endure for their testimony in His behalf, that He
said, “They will put you out of the synagogues.” Nor does He say, And
the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God
service. What then? “But the hour cometh:” just in the way He would have
spoken, were He foretelling them of something good that would follow
such evils. What, then, does He mean by the words, “They will put you
out of the synagogues: but the hour cometh”? As if He would have gone on
to say this: They, indeed, will scatter you, *but* I will gather you;
or, They shall, indeed, scatter you, *but* the hour of your joy cometh.
What, then, has the word which He uses, “*but* the hour cometh,” to do
here, as if He were going on to promise them comfort after their
tribulation, when apparently He ought rather to have said, in the form
of continuous narration,  <span id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520.md)
*And* the hour cometh? But He said not, And it cometh, although
predicting the approach of one tribulation after another, instead of
comfort after tribulation. Could it have been that such a separation
from the synagogues would so discompose them, that they would prefer to
die, rather than remain in this life apart from the Jewish assemblies?
Far surely would those be from such discomposure, who were seeking, not
the praise of men, but of God. What, then, of the words, “They will put
you out of the synagogues: but the hour cometh;” when apparently He
ought rather to have said, *And* the hour cometh, “that whosoever
killeth you will think that he doeth God service”? For it is not even
said, But the hour cometh that they shall kill you, as if implying that
their comfort for such a separation would be found in the death that
would befall them; but “The hour cometh,” He says, “that whosoever
killeth you will think that he doeth God service.” On the whole, I do
not think He wished to convey any further meaning than that they might
understand and rejoice that they themselves would gain so many to
Christ, by being driven out of the Jewish congregations, that it would
be found insufficient to expel them, and they would not suffer them to
live for fear of all being converted by their preaching to the name of
Christ, and so turned away from the observance of Judaism, as if it were
the very truth of God. For so ought we to understand the reference of
His words to the Jews, when He said of them, “They will put you out of
the synagogues.” For the witnesses, in other words, the martyrs of
Christ, were likewise slain by the Gentiles: they, however, thought not
that it was to the true God, but to their own false deities, that they
were doing service when they so acted. But every Jew that slew the
preachers of Christ reckoned that he was doing God serv <span
id="page_366">p. 366</span> <span id="iii.xciv-Page_366"></span>ice;
believing as he did that all who were converted to Christ were deserting
the God of Israel. For it was also by the same reasoning that they were
incited to the murder of Christ Himself: because their own words on this
subject have also been put on record. “Ye perceive that the whole world
is gone after him: <span id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521.md) “If we let
him live, the Romans will come, and take away both our place and
nation.” And those of Caiaphas: “It is expedient for us that one man
should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should
perish.” <span id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522.md) And accordingly in
this address He sought by His own example to stimulate His disciples, to
whom He had just been saying, “If they have persecuted me, they will
also persecute you;” <span id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523.md) that as
in slaying Him they thought they had done God a service, so also would
it be in reference to them.

<span id="iii.xciv-p20"></span>4. Such, then, is the meaning of these
words: “They will put you out of the synagogues;” but have no fear of
solitude: inasmuch as, when separated from their assembly, you will
assemble so many in my name, that they, in very fear lest the temple,
that was with them, and all the sacraments of the old law, should be
deserted, will slay you: actually, in thus shedding your blood, full of
the notion that they are doing God service. An illustration surely of
the apostle’s words, “They have a zeal for God, but not according to
knowledge;” <span id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524.md) when they imagine
that they are doing God service in slaying His servants. Appalling
mistake! Is it thus thou wouldst please God by striking down the
God-pleaser; and is the living temple of God by thy blows laid level
with the ground, that God’s temple of stone may not be deserted?
Accursed blindness! But it is in part that it has happened to Israel,
that the fullness of the Gentiles might come in: in part, I say, and not
totally, has it happened. For not all, but only some of the branches
have been broken off, that the wild olive might be ingrafted. <span
id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525.md) For just at the time when the
disciples of Christ, filled with the Holy Spirit, were speaking in the
tongues of all nations, and performing many divine miracles, and
scattering divine utterances on every side, Christ, even though slain,
was so beloved, that His disciples, when expelled from the congregations
of the Jews, gathered into a congregation of their own a vast multitude
of those very Jews, and had no fear of being left to solitude. <span
id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526.md) Whereupon, accordingly, the others,
reprobate and blind, being inflamed with wrath, and having a zeal of
God, but not according to knowledge, and believing that they were doing
God service, put them to death. But He, who was slain for them, gathered
those together; just as He had also, before He was slain, instructed
them in what was to happen, lest their minds, left ignorant and
unprepared, should be cast into trouble by evils, however transient,
that were unexpected and unprovided for; but rather by knowing of them
beforehand, and sustaining them with patience, might be led onward to
everlasting blessing. For that such was the cause of His making these
announcements to them beforehand, is shown also by His words that
followed: “But these things have I told you, that, when their time shall
come, ye may remember that I told you of them.” Their hour was an hour
of darkness, a midnight hour. But the Lord commanded His loving-kindness
in the daytime, and made them sing of it in the night: <span
id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527.md) when the Jewish night threw no
confusion of darkness into the day of the Christians, separated as it
was from themselves; and when that which could slay the flesh had no
power to darken their faith.
