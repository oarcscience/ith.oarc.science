<span id="iv.ii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Introduction.</span>

<span id="iv.ii-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="iv.ii-p2.1"></span>This</span> first Epistle of John, probably
written at Ephesus near the close of the first century, the last
utterance of the Spirit of inspiration, breathes the calmness of an
assured hope, and that fullness of joy of which the Apostle would have
his readers to be made partakers. While strongly refuting error, it is
not so much an argument as an intuition, an open vision of the divine
truths announced.

<span id="iv.ii-p3"></span>It was evidently written in a time of
external quiet for the Church, but of special exposure to errors and
perils from within. The nature of the principal error is plain,—the
denial that Jesus is the Christ ([1 John
2.22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022)<span id="iv.ii-p3.1"></span>.md).
Precisely this heresy was taught at Ephesus by Cerinthus in the old age
of the Apostle; he alleged that Jesus was a man eminent for wisdom and
holiness; that after his baptism Christ descended into him, and before
the crucifixion left Jesus and returned to heaven. Over against this
cardinal error, the Apostle announces the manifestation of the Son of
God in the flesh,—the Incarnation of that Eternal Life which was with
God from the beginning. This divine fact is shown in its own
self-evidencing light, and is so presented as to render the epistle a
“possession forever,” of incalculable value to the Church. In our day,
also, by separating Jesus the Son of Man from Christ the Son of God, the
one Divine-Human Lord and Saviour of man is denied and rejected. The
great words, fellowship, light, life, love, so often recurring in the
Epistle, are filled with new meanings as vehicles of the message of God,
as conveying the thoughts of God.

<span id="iv.ii-p4"></span>As regards the plan of the Epistle, it has
been often asserted till lately that it was supposed to be but
fragmentary, a series of aphorisms. Augustin, however, without formally
announcing a plan as discovered by him in the Epistle, not only
frequently affirms in his exposition that charity or love is the
Apostle’s main theme, but so conducts the discussion, gathering his
arguments and illustrations around this central thought, as to render it
evident that in his view the purpose and plan of the Apostle is to set
forth love in its essence and its scope, and that he intends to make
this thought dominant in every part. Westcott, in his admirable
commentary (2nd edition, 1886), does not draw out a plan, but gives
striking and comprehensive views of the object and scope of the Epistle.

<span id="iv.ii-p5"></span>Braune, in Lange’s commentary, makes two main
divisions, besides the introduction and conclusion: chief topic for the
first division: [1 John 1.5-2.28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.ii-p5.1"></span>, *God is Light*; for the second part: *Whosoever
is born of God doeth righteousness*.

<span id="iv.ii-p6"></span>Huther (4th edition, 1880) suggests a
three-fold division, first: [1 John
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md), [1 John
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.ii-p6.1"></span>,
*against indifference to truth and love of the world*; second: [1 John
2.29-3.22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.ii-p6.2"></span>, *a life of brotherly love alone is in agreement
with the nature of the child of God*; third: [1 John
3.23-5.17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.ii-p6.3"></span>, pointing to *faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of
God, as the foundation of the Christian Life*. As thus distributed (by
Huther) “the conclusion of each part points to the joy of which the
Christian partakes in fellowship with God.”

<span id="iv.ii-p7"></span>Objections have been urged to any division
proposed, as being inadequate; but the <span id="page_457">p. 457</span>
<span id="iv.ii-Page_457"></span>great divine facts of *fellowship with
God, fullness of joy in Him*, and an *Eternal Life of love through the
Son of God*, are leading topics. This is obvious; they are often
recurred to, are frequently conjoined, and in their grandeur surpass our
range and reach of thought, while satisfying the aspirations of the
soul.

<span id="iv.ii-p8"></span>In these discourses of Augustin, on the first
Epistle of John, we have a nearly complete text of the Epistle,—the
exposition of the last 18 verses not being extant. He followed the old
Itala, one of the most ancient (Latin) versions of the New Testament.
Variations between the text on which he comments and the best Greek text
(as given by Westcott and Hort), when of importance, are indicated in
this revised edition of the translation of his homilies. In comparing
the Oxford translation, word by word, with the original,—Benedictine
(Migne’s) edition,—several omissions, twelve at least, have been
discovered; and though brief, some of them are of considerable
importance: these are supplied in the present edition.

<span id="iv.ii-p9"></span>The translator copied, only too faithfully,
the very form of the Latin sentences: to change them throughout and to
remove all the archaisms in his English, might have seemed an undue
reflection on a work executed for the most part with extraordinary
fidelity.

<span id="iv.ii-p10"></span>After many alterations in phraseology,
probably enough still remains in the translation of the original antique
flavor to satisfy the taste of those who are ever disposed to say: “the
old is better.”

<span id="iv.ii-p11"></span>As regards any allegorizing tendency here
and there manifested in the exposition, it may suffice to say that it is
small in Augustin, as compared with very many of great fame.

<span id="iv.ii-p12"></span>If now and then he seems to mistake in
interpretation (as in Homily VII.), not considering that in the Greek
such propositions as “God is love,” are not convertible, the subject
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.ii-p12.1"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ii-p12.2"></span>θεός</span> being marked by
the article, and the predicate indicated by not having the article, let
it be remembered that some exegetical canons of the kind were unknown in
his time.

<span id="iv.ii-p13"></span>These expository discourses by the most
illustrious of the Fathers of the Western Church, while often exhibiting
great critical acumen, were not intended to be models in exegesis. They
are familiar, homiletical talks, racy and vivid in style, couched in the
plainest and most pointed language, and all aglow with the most fervent
love.

<span id="iv.ii-p14"></span>Whatever St. John was in this respect,
Augustin was clearly a polemic; but where can be found a more ardent
lover of the brethren, nay of all men, even the worst? Not the least
striking and touching of his utterances are those in which he discloses
the breadth and depth of his charity toward enemies, and affirms such
principles and such conduct to be necessarily and invariably found in
all those who are Christians indeed.—J.H.M.
