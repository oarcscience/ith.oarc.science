<span id="iii.cix"></span>

<span id="iii.cix-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.cix-p1.1"></span>Tractate CVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.cix-p2"></span><span id="iii.cix-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.cix-p2.2"></span>Chapter XVII. 14–19</span>.

<span id="iii.cix-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.cix-p3.1"></span>While</span> the Lord is still speaking to the
Father, and praying for His disciples, He says: “I have given them Thy
saying; and the world hath hated them.” That hatred they had not yet
experienced in those sufferings of their own, which afterwards overtook
them; but He speaks thus in His usual way, foretelling the future in
words of the past tense. And then, subjoining the reason of their being
hated by the world, He says, “Because they are not of the world, even as
I am not of the world.” This was conferred on them by regeneration; for
by generation they were of the world, as He had already said to them, “I
have chosen you out of the world.” <span
id="fr_1731"></span>[1732](#fn_1731) It was therefore a gracious
privilege bestowed upon them, that they, like Himself, should not be of
the world, through the deliverance which He was giving them from the
world. He, however, was never of the world; for even in respect of His
servant-form He was born of that Holy Spirit of whom they were born
again. For if on that account they were no more of the world, because
born again of the Holy Spirit; on the same account He was never of the
world, because born of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="iii.cix-p5"></span>2. “I pray not,” He adds, “that thou
shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them
from the evil.” For they still accounted it necessary to be in the
world, although they were no longer of it. Then He repeats the same
statement: “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
Sanctify them in the truth.” For so are they kept from the evil, as He
had previously prayed that they might be. But it may be inquired how
they were no more of the world, if they were not yet sanctified in the
truth; or, if they already were, why He requests that they should be so.
Is it not because even those who are sanctified still continue to make
progress in the same sanctification, and grow in holiness; and do not so
without the aid of God’s grace, but by His sanctifying of their
progress, even as He <span id="page_405">p. 405</span> <span
id="iii.cix-Page_405"></span>sanctified their outset? And hence the
apostle likewise says: “He who hath begun a good work in you, will
perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_1732"></span>[1733](#fn_1732) The heirs therefore of the New
Testament are sanctified in that truth which was adumbrated in the
purifications of the Old Testament; and when they are sanctified in the
truth, they are in other words sanctified in Christ, who said in truth,
“I am the way, and the truth, and the life.” <span
id="fr_1733"></span>[1734](#fn_1733) As also when He said, “The truth
shall make you free,” in explanation of His words, He added soon after,
“If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed;” <span
id="fr_1734"></span>[1735](#fn_1734) in order to show that what He had
previously called the truth, He a minute afterwards denominates the Son.
And what else did He mean by the words before us, “Sanctify them in the
truth,” but, Sanctify them in me?

<span id="iii.cix-p9"></span>3. Finally, He proceeds, and doing so fails
not to suggest the same with increasing clearness: “Thy speech (sermo)
is truth.” What else did He mean than “I am the truth”? For the Greek
Gospel has <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.cix-p9.1"></span>
λόγος</span>, which is also the word that is found in the passage where
it is said, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.” And that Word at least we know to be the only
begotten Son of God, which “was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735) Hence also there might have been
put here as it actually has been put in certain copies, “Thy Word is
truth;” just as in some copies that other passage is written, “In the
beginning was the speech.” But in the Greek without any variation it is
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.cix-p10.2"></span> λόγος</span> in
both cases. The Father therefore sanctifies in the truth, that is, in
His own Word, in His Only begotten, His own heirs and His (the Son’s)
co-heirs.

<span id="iii.cix-p11"></span>4. But now He still goes on to speak of
the apostles, for He proceeds to add, “As Thou hast sent me into the
world, even so have I also sent them into the world.” Whom did He so
send but His apostles? For even the very name of apostles, which is a
Greek word, signifies in Latin nothing more than, those that are sent.
God, therefore, sent His Son, not in sinful flesh, but in the likeness
of sinful flesh; <span id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736) and His Son
sent those who, born themselves in sinful flesh, were sanctified by Him
from the defilement of sin.

<span id="iii.cix-p13"></span>5. But since, on the ground that the
Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, has become Head of
the Church, they are His members; therefore He says in the words that
follow, “And for their sakes I sanctify myself.” For what means He by
the words, “And for their sakes I sanctify myself,” but I sanctify them
in myself, since they also are \[part of\] myself? <span
id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737) For those of whom He so speaks are,
as I have said, His members; and the head and body are one Christ, as
the apostle teaches when he says of the seed of Abraham, “And if ye be
Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed,” after having said before, “He
saith not, And to seeds, as in many, but as in one, And to thy seed,
which is Christ.” <span id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738) If, then,
the seed of Abraham is Christ, what else is declared to those to whom he
says, “Then are ye Abraham’s seed,” but then are ye Christ? Of the same
character is what this very apostle said in another place: “Now I
rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is lacking of
the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.” <span
id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739) He said not, of my afflictions, but
“of Christ’s;” for he was a member of Christ, and in his persecutions,
such as it behoved Christ to suffer in the whole of His body, he also
was filling up his own share of His afflictions. And to be assured of
the certainty of this in the present passage, give heed to what follows.
For after saying, “And for their sakes I sanctify myself,” to let us
understand that He thereby meant that He would sanctify them in Himself,
He immediately added, “That they also may be sanctified in the truth.”
And what else is this but in me, in accordance with the fact that the
truth is that Word in the beginning which is God? In whom also the Son
of man was Himself sanctified from the beginning of His creation, when
the Word was made flesh, for the Word and the man became one person.
Then accordingly He sanctified Himself in Himself, that is, Himself the
man in Himself the Word; for the Word and the man is one Christ, who
sanctifies the manhood in the Word. But in behalf of His members He
says, “And for their sakes I,”—that is, that the benefit may be also
theirs, for they too are \[included in the\] I, just as it benefited me
in myself, because I am man apart from them—“I sanctify myself,” that
is, I sanctify them as if it were my own self in me, since in me they
also are I. “That they also may be sanctified in the truth.” For what
else mean the words “they *also*,” but \[“they”\] *in the same way* as
I; “in the truth,” and that “truth” am I? After this He now begins to
speak not only of the apostles, but also of the rest of His members,
which we shall treat of, as grace may be granted us, in another
discourse.
