<span id="iii.cxx-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.cxx-p1.1"></span>Tractate CXIX.</span>

<span id="iii.cxx-p2"></span><span id="iii.cxx-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.cxx-p2.2"></span>Chapter XIX. 24–30</span>.

<span id="iii.cxx-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.cxx-p3.1"></span>The</span> Lord being now crucified, and the
parting of His garments having also been completed by the casting of the
lot, let us look at what the evangelist John thereafter relates. “And
these things,” he says, “the soldiers did. Now there stood by the cross
of Jesus His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary \[the wife\] of
Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and
the disciple standing by whom He loved, He saith unto His mother, Woman,
behold thy son! Then saith He to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And
from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home.” This, without a
doubt, was the hour whereof Jesus, when about to turn the water into
wine, had said to His mother, “Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine
hour is not yet come.” <span id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894.md) This
hour, therefore, He had foretold, which at that time had not yet
arrived, when it should be His to acknowledge her at the point of death,
and with reference to which He had been born as a mortal man. At that
time, therefore, when about to engage in divine acts, He repelled, as
one unknown, her who was the mother, not of His divinity, but of His
\[human\] infirmity; but now, when in the midst of human sufferings, He
commended with human affection \[the mother\] by whom He had become man.
For then, He who had created Mary became known in His power; but now,
that which Mary had brought forth was hanging on the cross. <span
id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895.md)

<span id="iii.cxx-p6"></span>2. A passage, therefore, of a moral
character is here inserted. The good Teacher does what He thereby
reminds us ought to be done, and by His own example instructed His
disciples that care for their parents ought to be a matter of concern to
pious children: as if that tree to which the members of the <span
id="page_433">p. 433</span> <span id="iii.cxx-Page_433"></span>dying One
were affixed were the very chair of office from which the Master was
imparting instruction. From this wholesome doctrine it was that the
Apostle Paul had learned what he taught in turn, when he said, “But if
any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house,
he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.” <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896.md) And what are so much home concerns
to any one, as parents to children, or children to parents? Of this most
wholesome precept, therefore, the very Master of the saints set the
example from Himself, when, not as God for the hand-maid whom He had
created and governed, but as a man for the mother, of whom He had been
created, and whom He was now leaving behind, He provided in some measure
another son in place of Himself. And why He did so, He indicates in the
words that follow: for the evangelist says, “And from that hour the
disciple took her unto his own,” speaking of himself. In this way,
indeed, he usually refers to himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved:
who certainly loved them all, but him beyond the others, and with a
closer familiarity, so that He even made him lean upon His bosom at
supper; <span id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897.md) in order, I believe,
in this way to commend the more highly the divine excellence of this
very gospel, which He was thereafter to preach through his
instrumentality.

<span id="iii.cxx-p9"></span>3. But what was this “his own,” unto which
John took the mother of the Lord? For he was not outside the circle of
those who said unto Him, “Lo, we have left all, and followed Thee.” No,
but on that same occasion he had also heard the words, Every one that
hath forsaken these things for my sake, shall receive an hundred times
as much in this world. <span id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898.md) That
disciple, therefore, had an hundredfold more than he had cast away,
whereunto to receive the mother of Him who had graciously bestowed it
all. But it was in that society that the blessed John had received an
hundredfold, where no one called anything his own, but they had all
things in common; even as it is recorded in the Acts of the Apostles.
For the apostles were as if having nothing, and yet possessing all
things. <span id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899.md) How was it, then,
that the disciple and servant received unto his own the mother of his
Lord and Master, where no one called anything his own? Or, seeing we
read a little further on in the same book, “For as many as were
possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of them,
and laid them down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto
every man according as he had need,” <span
id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900.md) are we not to understand that such
distribution was made to this disciple of what was needful, that there
was also added to it the portion of the blessed Mary, as if she were his
mother; and ought we not the rather so to take the words, “From that
hour the disciple took her unto his own,” that everything necessary for
her was entrusted to his care? He received her, therefore, not unto his
own lands, for he had none of his own; but to his own dutiful services,
the discharge of which, by a special dispensation, was entrusted to
himself.

<span id="iii.cxx-p13"></span>4. He then adds: “After this, Jesus
knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might
be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Now there was set a vessel full of
vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and fixed it upon
hyssop, and put it to His mouth. When Jesus therefore had received the
vinegar, He said, It is finished: and He bowed His head, and gave up the
ghost.” Who has the power of so adjusting what he does, as this Man had
of arranging all that He suffered? But this Man was the Mediator between
God and men; the Man of whom we read in prophecy, He is man also, and
who shall acknowledge Him? for the men who did such things acknowledged
not this Man as God. For He who was manifest as man, was hid as God: He
who was manifest suffered all these things, and He Himself also, who was
hid, arranged them all. He saw, therefore, that all was accomplished
that required to be done before He received the vinegar, and gave up the
ghost; and that this also might be accomplished which the scripture had
foretold, “And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink,” <span
id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901.md) He said, “I thirst:” as if it were,
One thing still you have failed to do, give me what you are. For the
Jews were themselves the vinegar, degenerated as they were from the wine
of the patriarchs and prophets; and filled like a full vessel with the
wickedness of this world, with hearts like a sponge, deceitful in the
formation of its cavernous and tortuous recesses. But the hyssop,
whereon they placed the sponge filled with vinegar, being a lowly herb,
and purging the heart, we fitly take for the humility of Christ Himself;
which they thus enclosed, and imagined they had completely ensnared.
Hence we have it said in the psalm, “Thou shalt purge me with hyssop,
and I shall be cleansed.” <span id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902.md) For
it is by Christ’s humility that we are cleansed; because, had He not
humbled Himself, and became obedient unto the death of the cross, <span
id="fr_1903"></span>[1904](#fn_1903.md) <span id="page_434">p. 434</span>
<span id="iii.cxx-Page_434"></span>His blood certainly would not have
been shed for the remission of sins, or, in other words, for our
cleansing.

<span id="iii.cxx-p17"></span>5. Nor need we be disturbed with the
question, how the sponge could be applied to His mouth when He was
lifted up from the earth on the cross. For as we read in the other
evangelists, what is omitted by this one, it was fixed on a reed, <span
id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904.md) so that such drink as was contained
in the sponge might be raised to the highest part of the cross. By the
reed, however, the scripture was signified, which was fulfilled by this
very act. For as a tongue is called either Greek or Latin, or any other,
significant of the sound, which is uttered by the tongue; so the reed
may give its name to the letter which is written with a reed. We most
usually, however, call those tongues that express the sounds of the
human voice: while in calling scripture a reed, the very rareness of the
thing only enhances the mystical nature of that which it symbolizes. A
wicked people did such things, a compassionate Christ suffered them.
They who did them, knew not what they did; but He who suffered, not only
knew what was done, and why it was so, but also wrought what was good
through those who were doing what was evil.

<span id="iii.cxx-p19"></span>6. “When Jesus therefore had received the
vinegar, He said, It is finished.” What, but all that prophecy had
foretold so long before? And then, because nothing now remained that
still required to be done before He died, as if He, who had power to lay
down His life and to take it up again, <span
id="fr_1905"></span>[1906](#fn_1905.md) had at length completed all for
whose completion He was waiting, “He bowed His head, and gave up the
ghost.” Who can thus sleep when he pleases, as Jesus died when He
pleased? Who is there that thus puts off his garment when he pleases, as
He put off His flesh at His pleasure? Who is there that thus
departs <span id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906.md) when he pleases, as
He departed this life <span id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907.md) at His
pleasure? How great the power, to be hoped for or dreaded, that must be
His as judge, if such was the power He exhibited as a dying man!
