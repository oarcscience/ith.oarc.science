<span id="iii.lxxxix-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.lxxxix-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXXXVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.lxxxix-p2"></span><span id="iii.lxxxix-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lxxxix-p2.2"></span>Chapter XV. 20, 21</span>.

<span id="iii.lxxxix-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxxxix-p3.1"></span>The</span> Lord, in exhorting His servants
to endure with patience the hatred of the world, proposes to them no
greater and better example than His own; seeing that, as the Apostle
Peter says, “Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we
should follow His steps.” <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461) And
if we really do so, we do it by His assistance, who said, “Without me ye
can do nothing.” But further, to those to whom He had already said, “If
the world hate you, know that it hated me before \[it hated\] you,” He
now also says in the word you have just been hearing, when the Gospel
was read, “Remember my word that I said unto you, The servant is not
greater than his lord: if they have persecuted me, they will also
persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.”
Now in saying, “The servant is not greater than his lord,” does He not
clearly indicate how He would have us understand what He had said above,
“Henceforth I call you not servants”? <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462) For, you see, He calleth them
servants. For what else can the words imply, “The servant is not greater
than his lord: if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute
you”? It is clear, therefore, that when it is said, “Henceforth I call
you not servants,” He is to be understood as speaking of that
servant <span id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463) who abideth not in
the house for ever, <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464) but is
characterized by the fear which love casteth out; <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465) whereas, when it is here said, “The
servant is not greater than his lord: if they have persecuted me, they
will also persecute you,” that servant is meant who is distinguished by
the clean fear which endureth for ever. <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466) For this is the servant who is yet
to hear, “Well done, thou good servant: enter thou into the joy of thy
Lord.” <span id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467)

<span id="iii.lxxxix-p11"></span>2. “But all these things,” He says,
“will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not Him
that sent me.” And what are “all these things” that “they will do,” but
what He has just said, namely, that they will hate and persecute you,
and despise your word? For if they kept not their word, and yet neither
hated nor persecuted them; or if they even hated, but did not persecute
them: it would not be *all these things* that they did. But “all these
things will they do unto you for my name’s sake,”—what else is that but
to say, they will hate me in you, they will persecute me in you; and
your word, just because it is mine, they will not keep? For “all these
things will they do unto you for my name’s sake:” not for yours, but
*mine*. So much the more miserable, therefore, are those who do such
things on account of that name, as those are blessed who suffer such
things in its behalf: as He Himself elsewhere saith, “Blessed are they
that suffer persecution for righteousness’ sake.” <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468) For that is on my account, or “for
my name’s sake:” because, as we are taught by the apostle, “He is made
of God unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and santification, and
redemption; that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him
glory in the Lord.” <span id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469) For the
wicked do such things to the wicked, but not for righteousness’ sake;
and therefore both are alike miserable, those who do, and those who
suffer them. The good also do such things to the wicked: where, although
the former do so for righteousness’ sake, yet the latter suffer them not
on the same behalf.

<span id="iii.lxxxix-p14"></span>3. But some one says, If, when the
wicked persecute the good for the name of Christ, the good suffer for
righteousness’ sake, then surely it is for righteousness’ sake that the
wicked do so to them; and if such is the case, then also, when the good
persecute the wicked for righteousness’ sake, it is for righteousness’
sake likewise that the wicked suffer. For if the wicked can assail the
good with persecution for the name of Christ, why cannot the wicked
suffer persecution at the hands of the good on the same account; and
what is that, but for righteousness’ sake? For if the good act not so on
the same account as that on which the wicked suffer, because the good do
so for righteousness’ sake, while the wicked suffer for unrighteousness,
so then neither can the wicked act so on the same account as that for
which the good suffer, because the wicked do so by unrighteousness,
while the good suffer for righteousness’ sake. And how then will that be
true, “All these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake,” when
the former do it not for the name of Christ, that is, for righteousness’
sake, but because of their own iniquity? Such a question is solved in
this way, if only we understand the words, <span id="page_357">p.
357</span> <span id="iii.lxxxix-Page_357"></span>“All these things will
they do unto you for my name’s sake,” as referring entirely to the
righteous, as if it had been said, All these things will ye suffer at
their hands for my name’s sake, so that the words, “they will do unto
you,” are equivalent to these, Ye will suffer at their hands. But if
“for my name’s sake” is to be taken as if He had said, For my name’s
sake which they hate in you, so also may the other be taken for that
righteousness’ sake which they hate in you; and in this way the good,
when they institute persecution against the wicked, may be rightly said
to do so both for righteousness’ sake, in their love for which they
persecute the wicked, and for that wickedness’ sake which they hate in
the wicked themselves; and so also the wicked may be said to suffer both
for the iniquity that is punished in their persons, and for the
righteousness which is exercised in their punishment.

<span id="iii.lxxxix-p15"></span>4. It may also be inquired, if the
wicked also persecute the wicked, just as ungodly princes and judges,
while they were the persecutors of the godly, certainly also punished
murderers and adulterers, and all classes of evil-doers whom they
ascertained to be acting contrary to the public laws, how are we to
understand the words of the Lord, “If ye were of the world, the world
would love its own”? ([John 15.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019)<span
id="iii.lxxxix-p15.1"></span>.) For those whom it punisheth cannot be
loved by the world, which, we see, generally punisheth the classes of
crimes mentioned above, save only that the world is both in those who
punish such crimes, and in those that love them. Therefore that world,
which is to be understood as existing in the wicked and ungodly, both
hateth its own in respect of that section of men in whose case it
inflicts injury on the criminal, and loveth its own in respect of that
other section in whose case it shows favor to its own partners in
criminality. Hence, “All these things will they do unto you for my
name’s sake,” is said either in reference to that for the sake of which
ye suffer, or to that on account of which they themselves so deal with
you, because that which is in you they both hate and persecute. And He
added, “Because they know not Him that sent me.” This is to be
understood as spoken of that knowledge of which it is also elsewhere
recorded, “But to know Thee is perfect intelligence.”  <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470) For those who with such a knowledge
know the Father, by whom Christ was sent, can in no wise persecute those
whom Christ is gathering; for they also themselves are being gathered by
Christ along with the others.
