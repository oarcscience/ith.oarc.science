<span id="iii.xxv-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.xxv-p3.1"></span>The</span> miracles performed by our Lord Jesus
Christ are indeed divine works, and incite the human mind to rise to the
apprehension of God from the things that are seen. But inasmuch as He is
not such a substance as may be seen with the eyes, and His miracles in
the government of the whole world and the administration of the
universal creation are, by their familiar constancy, slightly regarded,
so that almost no man deigns to consider the wonderful and stupendous
works of God, exhibited in every grain of seed; He has, agreeably to His
mercy, reserved to Himself certain works, beyond the usual course and
order of nature, which He should perform on fit occasion, that they, by
whom His daily works are lightly esteemed, might be struck with
astonishment at beholding, not indeed greater, but uncommon works. For
certainly the government of the whole world is a greater miracle than
the satisfying of five thousand men with five loaves; and yet no man
wonders at the former; but the latter men wonder at, not because it is
greater, but because it is rare. For who even now feeds the whole world,
but He who creates the cornfield from a few grains? He therefore created
as God creates. For, whence He multiplies the produce of the fields from
a few grains, from the same source He multiplied in His hands the five
loaves. The power, indeed, was in the hands of Christ; but those five
loaves were as seeds, not indeed committed to the earth, but multiplied
by Him who made the earth. In this miracle, then, there is that brought
near to the senses, whereby the mind should be roused to attention,
there is exhibited to the eyes, whereon the understanding should be
exercised, that we might admire the invisible God through His visible
works; and being raised to faith and purged by faith, we might desire to
behold Him even invisibly, whom invisible we came to know by the things
that are visible.

<span id="iii.xxv-p4"></span>2. Yet it is not enough to observe these
things in the miracles of Christ. Let us interrogate the miracles
themselves, what they tell us about Christ: for they have a tongue of
their own, if they can be understood. For since Christ is Himself the
Word of God, even the act of the Word is a word to us. Therefore as to
this miracle, since we have heard how great it is, let us also search
how profound it is; let us not only be delighted with its surface, but
let us also seek to know its depth. This miracle, which we admire on the
outside, has something within. We have seen, we have looked at something
great, something glorious, and altogether divine, which could be
performed only by God: we have praised the doer for the deed. But just
as, if we were to inspect a beautiful writing somewhere, it would not
suffice for us to praise the hand of the writer, because he formed the
letters even, equal and elegant, if we did not also read the information
he conveyed to us by those letters; so, he who merely inspects this deed
may be delighted with its beauty to admire the doer: but he who
understands does, as it were, read it. For a picture is looked at in a
different way from that in which a writing is looked at. When thou hast
seen a picture, to have seen and praised it is the whole thing; when
thou seest a writing, this is not the whole, since thou art reminded
also to read it. Moreover, when thou seest a writing, if it chance that
thou canst not read, thou sayest, “What do we think that to be which is
here written?” Thou askest what it is, when already thou seest it to be
something. He of whom thou seekest to be informed what it is that thou
hast seen, will show thee another thing. He has other eyes than thou
hast. Do you not alike see the form of the letters? But yet you do not
alike understand the signs. Well, thou seest and praisest; but he sees,
praises, reads and understands. Therefore, since we have seen and
praised, let us also read and understand.

<span id="iii.xxv-p5"></span>3. The Lord on the mount: much rather let
us understand that the Lord on the mount is the Word on high.
Accordingly, what was done on the mount does not, as it were, lie low,
nor is to be cursorily passed by, but must be looked up to. He saw the
multitude, knew them to be hungering, mercifully fed them: not only in
virtue of His goodness, but also of His power. For what would mere
goodness avail, where there was not bread with which to feed the hungry
crowd? Did not power attend upon goodness, that crowd had remained
fasting and hungry. In short, the disciples also, who were with the
Lord, and hungry, themselves wished to feed the multitudes, that they
might not remain empty, but had not wherewithal to feed <span
id="page_159">p. 159</span> <span id="iii.xxv-Page_159"></span>them. The
Lord asked, whence they might buy bread to feed the multitude. And the
Scripture saith: “But this He said, proving him;” namely, the disciple
Philip of whom He had asked; “for Himself knew what He would do.” Of
what advantage then was it to prove him, unless to show the disciple’s
ignorance? And, perhaps, in showing the disciple’s ignorance He
signified something more. This will appear, then, when the sacrament of
the five loaves itself will begin to speak to us, and to intimate its
meaning: for there we shall see why the Lord in this act wished to
exhibit the disciple’s ignorance, by asking what He Himself knew. For we
sometimes ask what we do not know, that, being willing to hear, we may
learn; sometimes we ask what we do know, wishing to learn whether he
whom we ask also knows. The Lord knew both the one and the other; knew
both what He asked, for He knew what Himself would do; and He also knew
in like manner that Philip knew not this. Why then did He ask, but to
show Philip’s ignorance? And why He did this, we shall, as I have said,
understand afterwards.

<span id="iii.xxv-p6"></span>4. Andrew saith: “There is a lad here, who
has five loaves and two fishes, but what are these for so many?” When
Philip, on being asked, had said that two hundred pennyworth of bread
would not suffice to refresh that so great a multitude, there was there
a certain lad, carrying five barley loaves and two fishes. “And Jesus
saith, Make the men sit down. Now there was there much grass: and they
sat down about five thousand men. And the Lord Jesus took the loaves,
gave thanks;” He commanded, the loaves were broken, and put before the
men that were set down. It was no longer five loaves, but what He had
added thereto, who had created that which was increased. “And of the
fishes as much as sufficed.” It was not enough that the multitude had
been satisfied, there remained also fragments; and these were ordered to
be gathered up, that they should not be lost: “And they filled twelve
baskets with the fragments.”

<span id="iii.xxv-p7"></span>5. To run over it briefly: by the five
loaves are understood the five books of Moses; and rightly are they not
wheaten but barley loaves, because they belong to the Old Testament. And
you know that barley is so formed that we get at its pith with
difficulty; for the pith is covered in a coating of husk, and the husk
itself tenacious and closely adhering, so as to be stripped off with
labor. Such is the letter of the Old Testament, invested in a covering
of carnal sacraments: but yet, if we get at its pith, it feeds and
satisfies us. A certain lad, then, brought five loaves and two fishes.
If we inquire who this lad was, perhaps it was the people Israel, which,
in a childish sense, carried, not ate. For the things which they carried
were a burden while shut up, but when opened afforded nourishment. And
as for the two fishes, they appear to us to signify those two sublime
persons, in the Old Testament, of priest and of ruler, who were anointed
for the sanctifying and governing of the people. And at length Himself
in the mystery came, who was signified by those persons: He at length
came who was pointed out by the pith of the barley, but concealed by its
husk. He came, sustaining in His one person the two characters of priest
and ruler: of priest by offering Himself to God as a victim for us; of
ruler, because by Him we are governed. And the things that were carried
closed are now opened up. Thanks be to Him. He has fulfilled by Himself
what was promised in the Old Testament. And He bade the loaves to be
broken; in the breaking they are multiplied. Nothing is more true. For
when those five books of Moses are expounded, how many books have they
made by being broken up, as it were; that is, by being opened and laid
out? But because in that barley the ignorance of the first people was
veiled, of whom it is said, “Whilst Moses is read, the veil is upon
their hearts;”  <span id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md) for the veil was
not yet removed, because Christ had not yet come; not yet was the veil
of the temple rent, while Christ is hanging on the cross: because, I
say, the ignorance of the people was in the law, therefore that proving
by the Lord made the ignorance of the disciple manifest.

<span id="iii.xxv-p9"></span>6. Wherefore nothing is without meaning;
everything is significant, but requires one that understands: for even
this number of the people fed, signified the people that were under the
law. For why were there five thousand, but because they were under the
law, which is unfolded in the five books of Moses? Why were the sick
laid at those five porches, but not healed? He, however, there cured the
impotent man, who here fed multitudes with five loaves. Moreover, they
sat down upon the grass; therefore understood carnally, and rested in
the carnal. “For all flesh is grass.” <span
id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md) And what were those fragments, but
things which the people were not able to eat? We understand them to be
certain matters of more hidden meaning, which the multitude are not able
to take in. What remains then, but that those matters of more hidden
meaning, which the multitude cannot take in, be entrusted to men <span
id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span id="iii.xxv-Page_160"></span>who are
fit to teach others also, just as were the apostles? Why were twelve
baskets filled? This was done both marvellously, because a great thing
was done; and it was done profitably, because a spiritual thing was
done. They who at the time saw it, marvelled; but we, hearing of it, do
not marvel. For it was done that they might see it, but it was written
that we might hear it. What the eyes were able to do in their case, that
faith does in our case. We perceive, namely, with the mind, what we
could not with the eyes: and we are preferred before them, because of us
it is said, “Blessed are they who see not, and yet believe.” <span
id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) And I add that, perhaps, we have
understood what that crowd did not understand. And we have been fed in
reality, in that we have been able to get at the pith of the barley.

<span id="iii.xxv-p12"></span>7. Lastly, what did those men who saw this
miracle think? “The men,” saith he, “when they had seen the sign which
He had done, said, This is indeed a prophet.” Perhaps they still thought
Christ to be a prophet for this reason, namely, that they were sitting
on the grass. But He was the Lord of the prophets, the fulfiller of the
prophets, the sanctifier of the prophets, but yet a prophet also: for it
was said to Moses, “I will raise up for them a prophet like unto thee.”
Like, according to the flesh, but not according to the majesty. And that
this promise of the Lord is to be understood concerning Christ Himself,
is clearly expounded and read in the Acts of the Apostles. <span
id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) And the Lord says of Himself, “A
prophet is not without honor, except in his own country.” <span
id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) The Lord is a prophet, and the Lord is
God’s Word, and no prophet prophesies without the Word of God: the Word
of God is with the prophets, and the Word of God is a prophet. The
former times obtained prophets inspired and filled by the Word of God:
we have obtained the very Word of God for our prophet. But Christ is in
such manner a prophet, the Lord of prophets, as Christ is an angel, the
Lord of angels. For He is also called the Angel of great counsel.  <span
id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) Nevertheless, what says the prophet
elsewhere that not an ambassador, nor an angel, but Himself coming will
save them; <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) that is, He will not
send an ambassador to save them, nor an angel, but Himself will come.
Who will come? The Angel himself? Certainly not by an angel will He save
them, except that He is so an angel, as also Lord of angels. For angels
signify messengers. If Christ brought no message, He would not be called
an angel: if Christ prophesied nothing, He would not be called a
prophet. He has exhorted us to faith and to laying hold of eternal life;
He has proclaimed something present, foretold something future because
He proclaimed the present, thence He was an angel or messenger; because
He foretold the future, thence He was a prophet; and that, as the Word
of God He was made flesh, thence He was Lord of angels and of prophets.
