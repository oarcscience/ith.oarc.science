<span id="iii.lxii-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.lxii-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXI.</span>

<span id="iii.lxii-p2"></span><span id="iii.lxii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lxii-p2.2"></span>Chapter XIII. 21–26</span>.

<span id="iii.lxii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxii-p3.1"></span>This</span> short section of the Gospel,
brethren, we have in this lesson brought forward for exposition, as
thinking that we ought also to say something of the Lord’s betrayer, as
now plainly enough disclosed by the dipping and holding out to him of
the piece of bread. Of that indeed which precedes, (namely), that Jesus,
when about to point him out, was troubled in spirit, we have treated in
our last discourse; but what I perhaps omitted to mention there, the
Lord, by His own perturbation of spirit, thought proper to indicate this
also, that it is necessary to bear with false brethren, and those tares
that are among the wheat in the Lord’s field until harvest-time, because
that when we are compelled by <span id="page_311">p. 311</span> <span
id="iii.lxii-Page_311"></span>urgent reasons to separate some of them
even before the harvest, it cannot be done without disturbance to the
Church. Such disturbance to His saints in the future, through
schismatics and heretics, the Lord in a way foretold and prefigured in
Himself, when, at the moment of that wicked man Judas’ departure, and of
his thereby bringing to an end, in a very open and decided way, his past
intermingling with the wheat, in which he had long been tolerated, He
was troubled, not in body, but in spirit. For it is not spitefulness,
but charity, that troubles His spiritual members in scandals of this
kind; lest perchance, in separating some of the tares, any of the wheat
should also be uprooted therewith.

<span id="iii.lxii-p4"></span>2. “Jesus,” therefore, “was troubled in
spirit, and testified, and said: Verily, verily, I say unto you, that
one of you shall betray me.” “One of you,” in number, not in merit; in
appearance, not in reality; in bodily commingling, not by any spiritual
tie; a companion by fleshly juxtaposition, not in any unity of the
heart; and therefore not one who is of you, but one who is to go forth
from you. For how else can this “one of you” be true, of which the Lord
so testified, and said, if that is true which the writer of this very
Gospel says in his Epistle, “They went out from us, but they were not of
us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with
us”? <span id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201.md) Judas, therefore was not
of them; for, had he been of them, he would have continued with them.
What, then, do the words “One of you shall betray me” mean, but that one
is going out from you who shall betray me? Just as he also, who said,
“If they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us,”
had said before, “They went out from us.” And thus it is true in both
senses, “of us,” and “not of us;” in one respect “of us,” and in another
“not of us;” “of us” in respect to sacramental communion, but “not of
us” in respect to the criminal conduct that belongs exclusively to
themselves.

<span id="iii.lxii-p6"></span>3. “Then the disciples looked one on
another, doubting of whom He spake.” For while they were imbued with a
reverential love to their Master, they were none the less affected by
human infirmity in their feelings towards each other. Each one’s own
conscience was known to himself; but as he was ignorant of his
neighbor’s, each one’s self-assurance was such that each was uncertain
of all the others, and all the others were uncertain of that one.

<span id="iii.lxii-p7"></span>4. “Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom,
one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved.” What he meant by saying “in His
bosom,” he tells us a little further on, where he says, “on the breast
of Jesus.” It was that very John whose Gospel is before us, as he
afterwards expressly declares. <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202.md) For it was a custom with those who
have supplied us with the sacred writings, that when any of them was
relating the divine history, and came to something affecting himself, he
spoke as if it were about another; and gave himself a place in the line
of his narrative becoming one who was the recorder of public events, and
not as one who made himself the subject of his preaching. Saint Matthew
acted also in this way, when, in coming in the course of his narrative
to himself, he says, “He saw a publican named Matthew, sitting at the
receipt of custom, and saith unto him, Follow me.” <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203.md) He does not say, He saw *me*, and
said to *me*. So also acted the blessed Moses, writing all the history
about himself as if it concerned another, and saying, “The Lord said
unto Moses.” <span id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204.md) Less habitually
was this done by the Apostle Paul, not however in any history which
undertakes to explain the course of public events, but in his own
epistles. At all events, he speaks thus of himself: “I knew a man in
Christ fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, or whether out of the
body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up into the third
heaven.” <span id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205.md) And so, when the
blessed evangelist also says here, not, I was leaning on Jesus’ bosom,
but, “There was leaning one of the disciples,” let us recognize a custom
of our author’s, rather than fall into any wonder on the subject. For
what loss is there to the truth, when the facts themselves are told us,
and all boastfulness of language is in a measure avoided? For thus at
least did he relate that which most signally pertained to his praise.

<span id="iii.lxii-p12"></span>5. But what mean the words, “whom Jesus
loved”? As if He did not love the others, of whom this same John has
said above, “He loved them to the end” ([John
13.1](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.lxii-p12.1"></span>); and as the Lord Himself, “Greater love
hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.”
And who could enumerate all the testimonies of the sacred pages, in
which the Lord Jesus is exhibited as the lover, not only of this one, or
of those who were then around Him, but of such also as were to be His
members in the distant future, and of His universal Church? But there is
some truth, doubtless, underlying these words, and having reference to
the bosom on which the narrator was leaning. For what else can be in
<span id="page_312">p. 312</span> <span
id="iii.lxii-Page_312"></span>dicated by the *bosom* but some hidden
truth? But there is another more suitable passage, where the Lord may
enable us to say something about this secret that may prove sufficient.

<span id="iii.lxii-p13"></span>6. “Simon Peter therefore beckons, and
says to him.” <span id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206.md) The expression
is noteworthy, as indicating that something was said not by any sound of
words, but by merely beckoning with the head. “He beckons, and says;”
that is, his beckoning is his speech. For if one is said to speak in his
thoughts, as Scripture saith, “They said \[reasoned\] with
themselves;” <span id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207.md) how much more
may he do so by beckoning, which expresses outwardly by some sort of
signs what had previously been conceived within! What, then, did his
beckoning mean? What else but that which follows? “Who is it of whom He
speaks?” Such was the language of Peter’s beckoning; for it was by no
vocal sounds, but by bodily gestures, that he spake. “He then, having
leaned back on Jesus’ breast,”—surely the very bosom <span
id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208.md) of His breast this, the secret
place of wisdom!—“saith unto Him, Lord, who is it? Jesus answered, He it
is to whom I shall give a piece of bread, when I have dipped it. And
when He had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of
Simon. And after the bread, Satan entered into him.” The traitor was
disclosed, the coverts of darkness were revealed. What he got was good,
but to his own hurt he received it, because, evil himself, in an evil
spirit he received what was good. But we have much to say about that
dipped bread which was presented to the false-hearted disciple, and
about that which follows; and for these we shall require more time than
remains to us now at the close of this discourse.

<span id="iii.lxii-p14"></span> The original <span class="c10"><span

verse. That followed by our English version is supported by the Codd.
Alex. and Cantabr., which read, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.lxii-p14.2"></span>Νεύει οὖν τούτῳ Σίμων Πέτρος πυθέσθαι τίς ἂν
εἴη περὶ οὗ λέγει</span>. The Latin version used by Augustin reads,
*Innuit ergo Simon Petrus, et dicit ei, Quis est de quo dicit*, and
approaches nearly to that found in the Codd. Vat. and Ephr., which read,
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.lxii-p14.3"></span>Νεύει οὗν τούτῳ Σ.
Π., καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ, Εἰπὲ τίς ἐστιν περὶ οὗ λέγει</span>—“Simon Peter
therefore beckons to this one, and says to him, Say \[ask\], who is it
of whom He speaks?” Of the early versions, the Syriac adopts the former,
while the Vulgate resembles the latter. The Sinaitic gives a fuller
reading, compounded of both the others. There is thus some doubt as to
the original text; but the latter has some special arguments of an
internal kind in its favor: such as the consideration that, from its
peculiar and somewhat redundant form, *it* could hardly have been
substituted in place of the former, which is smoother and more elegant,
while the converse is perfectly supposable; and also the weighty fact
that John nowhere else makes use of the optative mood, as he would here
(<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.lxii-p14.4"></span>τίς ἂν
εἴη</span>), if the former reading—that followed by our English
version—were the true one.—<span class="c10"><span
