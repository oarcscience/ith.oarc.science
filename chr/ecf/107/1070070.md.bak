<span id="iii.lxviii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="iii.lxviii-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXVII.</span>

<span id="iii.lxviii-p2"></span><span id="iii.lxviii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lxviii-p2.2"></span>Chapter XIV. 1–3</span>.

<span id="iii.lxviii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxviii-p3.1"></span>Our</span> special attention, brethren, must
be earnestly turned to God, in order that we may be able to obtain some
intelligent apprehension of the words of the holy Gospel, which have
just been ringing in our ears. For the Lord Jesus saith: “Let not your
heart be troubled. Believe <span id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251.md) in
God, and believe \[*or*, believe also\] in me.” That they might not as
men be afraid of death, and so be troubled, He comforts them by
affirming Himself also to be God. “Believe,” He says, “in God, believe
also in me.” For it follows as a consequence, that if ye believe in God,
ye ought to believe also in me: which were no consequence if Christ were
not God. “Believe in God, and believe in” Him, who, by nature and not by
robbery, is equal with God; for He emptied Himself; not, however, by
losing the form of God, but by taking the form of a servant. <span
id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252.md) You are afraid of death as regards
this servant form, “let not your heart be troubled,” the form of God
will raise it again.

<span id="iii.lxviii-p6"></span>2. But why have we this that follows,
“In my Father’s house are many mansions,” but that they were also in
fear about themselves? And therein they might have heard the words, “Let
not your heart be troubled.” For, was there any of them that could be
free from fear, when Peter, the most confident and forward of them all,
was told, “The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me
thrice”? <span id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253.md) Considering
themselves, therefore, beginning with Peter, as destined to perish, they
had cause to be troubled: but when they now hear, “In my Father’s house
are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to
prepare a place for you,” they are revived from their trouble, made
certain and confident that after all the perils of temptations they
shall dwell with Christ in the presence of God. For, albeit one is
stronger than another, one wiser than another, one more righteous than
another, “in the Father’s house there are many mansions;” none of them
shall remain outside that house, where every one, according to his
deserts, is to receive a mansion. All alike have that penny, which the
householder orders to be given to all that have wrought in the vineyard,
making no distinction therein between those who have labored less and
those who have labored more: <span id="fr_1254"></span>[1255](#fn_1254.md)
by which penny, of course, is signified eternal life, whereto no one any
longer lives to a different length than others, since in eternity life
has no diversity in its measure. But the many mansions point to the
different grades of merit in that one eternal life. For there is one
glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the
stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory; and so also
the resurrection of the dead. The saints, like the stars in the sky,
obtain in the kingdom different mansions of diverse degrees of
brightness; but on account of that one penny no one is cut off from the
kingdom; and God will be all in all <span
id="fr_1255"></span>[1256](#fn_1255.md) in such a way, that, as God is
love, <span id="fr_1256"></span>[1257](#fn_1256.md) love will bring it
about that what is possessed by each will be common to all. For in this
way every one really possesses it, when he loves to see in another what
he has not himself. There will not, therefore, be any envying amid this
diversity of brightness, since in all of them will be reigning the unity
of love.

<span id="iii.lxviii-p11"></span>3. Every Christian heart, therefore,
must utterly reject the idea of those who imagine that there are many
mansions spoken of, because there will be some place outside the kingdom
of heaven, which shall be the abode of those blessed innocents who have
departed this life without baptism, because without it they cannot enter
the kingdom of heaven. Faith like this is not faith, inasmuch as it is
not the true and catholic faith. Are you not so foolish and blinded with
carnal imaginations as to be worthy of reprobation, if you should thus
separate the mansion, I say not of Peter and Paul, or any of the
apostles, but even of any baptized infant from the kingdom of heaven; do
you not think yourselves deserving of reprobation in thus putting a
separation between these and the house of God the Father? For the Lord’s
words are not, In the whole world, or, In all creation, or, In
everlasting life and blessedness, there are many mansions; but He says,
“In my Father’s house are many mansions.” Is not that the house where we
have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens? <span id="fr_1257"></span>[1258](#fn_1257.md) Is not that the
house whereof we sing to the Lord, “Blessed are they that <span
id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span id="iii.lxviii-Page_322"></span>dwell
in Thy house; they shall praise Thee for ever and ever”? <span
id="fr_1258"></span>[1259](#fn_1258.md) Will you then venture to separate
from the kingdom of heaven the house, not of every baptized brother, but
of God the Father Himself, to whom all we who are brethren say, “Our
Father, who art in heaven,” <span id="fr_1259"></span>[1260](#fn_1259.md)
or divide it in such a way as to make some of its mansions inside, and
some outside, the kingdom of heaven? Far, far be it from those who
desire to dwell in the kingdom of heaven, to be willing to dwell in such
folly with you: far be it, I say, that since every house of sons that
are reigning can be nowhere else but in the kingdom, any part of the
royal house itself should be outside the kingdom.

<span id="iii.lxviii-p15"></span>4. “And if I go,” He says, “and prepare
a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that
where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way
ye know.” O Lord Jesus, how goest Thou to prepare a place, if there are
already many mansions in Thy Father’s house, where Thy people shall
dwell with Thyself? Or if Thou receivest them unto Thyself, how wilt
Thou come again, who never withdrawest Thy presence? Such subjects as
these, beloved, were we to attempt to explain them with such brevity as
seems within the proper bounds of our discourse to-day, would certainly
suffer in clearness from compression, and the very brevity would become
itself a second obscurity; we shall therefore defer this debt, which the
bounty of our Family-head will enable us to repay at a more suitable
opportunity.
