<span id="iii.lxix-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.lxix-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXVIII.</span>

<span id="iii.lxix-p2"></span><span id="iii.lxix-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lxix-p2.2"></span>on the same passage</span>.

<span id="iii.lxix-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxix-p3.1"></span>We</span> acknowledge, beloved brethren, that
we are owing you, and ought now to repay, what was left over for
consideration, how we can understand that there is no real mutual
contrariety between these two statements, namely, that after saying, “In
my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have
told you, that I go to prepare a place for you;”—where He makes it clear
enough that He said so to them for the very reason that there are many
mansions there already, and there is no need of preparing any; <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260.md) —the Lord again says: “And if I go
and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto
myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” How is it that He goes
and prepares a place, if there are many mansions already? If there were
not such, He would have said, “I go to prepare.” Or if the place has
still to be prepared, would He not then also properly have said, “I go
to prepare”? Are these mansions in existence already, and yet needing
still to be prepared? For if they were not in existence, He would have
said, “I go to prepare.” And yet, because their present state of
existence is such as still to stand in need of preparation, He does not
go to prepare them in the same sense as they already exist; but if He go
and prepare them as they shall be hereafter, He will come again and
receive His own to Himself: that where He is, there they may be also.
How then are there mansions in the Father’s house, and these not
different ones but the same, which already exist in a sense in which
they can admit of no preparation, and yet do not exist, inasmuch as they
are still to be prepared? How are we to think of this, but in the same
way as the prophet, who also declares of God, that He has \[already\]
made that which is yet to be. For he says not, Who will make what is yet
to be, but, “Who has made what is yet to be.” <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261.md) Therefore He has both made such
things and is yet to make them. For they have not been <span
id="page_323">p. 323</span> <span id="iii.lxix-Page_323"></span>made at
all if He has not made them; nor will they ever be if He make them not
Himself. He has made them therefore in the way of fore-ordaining them;
He has yet to make them in the way of actual elaboration. Just as the
Gospel plainly intimates when He chose His disciples, that is to say, at
the time of His calling them; <span id="fr_1262"></span>[1263](#fn_1262.md)
and yet the apostle says, “He chose us before the foundation of the
world,” <span id="fr_1263"></span>[1264](#fn_1263.md) to wit, by
predestination, not by actual calling. “And whom He did predestinate,
them He also called;” <span id="fr_1264"></span>[1265](#fn_1264.md) He hath
chosen by predestination before the foundation of the world, He chooses
by calling before its close. And so also has He prepared those mansions,
and is still preparing them and He who has already made the things which
are yet to be, is now preparing, not different ones, but the very
mansions He has already prepared: what He *has* prepared in
predestination, He *is* preparing by actual working. Already, therefore,
they *are*, as respects predestination; if it were not so, He would have
said, I will go and prepare, that is, I will predestinate. But because
they are not yet in a state of practical preparedness, He says, “And if
I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you
unto myself.”

<span id="iii.lxix-p9"></span>2. But He is in a certain sense preparing
the dwellings by preparing for them the dwellers. As, for instance, when
He said, “In my Father’s house are many dwellings,” what else can we
suppose the house of God to mean but the temple of God? And what that
is, ask the apostle, and he will reply, “For the temple of God is holy,
which \[temple\] ye are.” <span id="fr_1265"></span>[1266](#fn_1265.md)
This is also the kingdom of God, which the Son is yet to deliver up to
the Father; and hence the same apostle says, “Christ, the beginning, and
then they that are Christ’s in His presence; then \[cometh\] the end,
when He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the
Father;” <span id="fr_1266"></span>[1267](#fn_1266.md) that is, those whom
He has redeemed by His blood, He shall then have delivered up to stand
before His Father’s face. This is that kingdom of heaven whereof it is
said, “The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man who sowed good seed
in his field. But the good seed are the children of the kingdom;” and
although now they are mingled with tares, at the end the King Himself
shall send forth His angels, “and they shall gather out of His kingdom
all things that offend. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun
in the kingdom of their Father.” <span
id="fr_1267"></span>[1268](#fn_1267.md) The kingdom will shine forth in the
kingdom when \[those that are\] the kingdom shall have reached the
kingdom; just as we now pray when we say, “Thy kingdom come.” <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[1269](#fn_1268.md) Even now, therefore, already is the
kingdom called, but only as yet being called together. For if it were
not now called, it could not be then said, “They shall gather out of His
kingdom everything that offends.” But the realm is not yet reigning.
Accordingly it is already so far the kingdom, that when all offences
shall have been gathered out of it, it shall then attain to sovereignty,
so as to possess not merely the name of a kingdom, but also the power of
government. For it is to this kingdom, standing then at the right hand,
that it shall be said in the end, “Come, ye blessed of my Father,
receive the kingdom;” <span id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269.md) that
is, ye who were the kingdom, but without the power to rule, come and
reign; that what you formerly were only in hope, you may now have the
power to be in reality. This house of God, therefore, this temple of
God, this kingdom of God and kingdom of heaven, is as yet in the process
of building, of construction, of preparation, of assembling. In it there
will be mansions, even as the Lord is now preparing them; in it there
are such already, even as the Lord has already ordained them.

<span id="iii.lxix-p15"></span>3. But why is it that He went away to
make such preparation, when, as it is certainly we ourselves that are
the subjects in need of preparation, His doing so will be hindered by
leaving us behind? I explain it, Lord, as I can: it was surely this Thou
didst signify by the preparation of those mansions, that the just ought
to live by faith. <span id="fr_1270"></span>[1271](#fn_1270.md) For he who
is sojourning at a distance from the Lord has need to be living by
faith, because by this we are prepared for beholding His
countenance. <span id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271.md) For “blessed are
the pure in heart, for they shall see God;” <span
id="fr_1272"></span>[1273](#fn_1272.md) and “He purifieth their hearts by
faith.” <span id="fr_1273"></span>[1274](#fn_1273.md) The former we find in
the Gospel, the latter in the Acts of the Apostles. But the faith by
which those who are yet to see God have their hearts purified, while
sojourning at a distance here, believeth what it doth not see; for if
there is sight, there is no longer faith. Merit is accumulating now to
the believer, and then the reward is paid into the hand of the beholder.
Let the Lord then go and prepare us a place; let Him go, that He may not
be seen; and let Him remain concealed, that faith may be exercised. For
then is the place preparing, if it is by faith we are living. Let the
believing in that place be desired, that the place desired may itself be
possessed; the longing of love is the preparation of the mansion.
Prepare thus, Lord, <span id="page_324">p. 324</span> <span
id="iii.lxix-Page_324"></span>what Thou art preparing; for Thou art
preparing us for Thyself, and Thyself for us, inasmuch as Thou art
preparing a place both for Thyself in us, and for us in Thee. For Thou
hast said, “Abide in me, and I in you.” <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274.md) As far as each one has been a
partaker of Thee, some less, some more, such will be the diversity of
rewards in proportion to the diversity of merits; such will be the
multitude of mansions to suit the inequalities among their inmates; but
all of them, none the less, eternally living, and endlessly blessed. Why
is it that Thou goest away? Why is it Thou comest again? If I understand
Thee aright, Thou withdrawest not Thyself either from the place Thou
goest from, or from the place Thou comest from: Thou goest away by
becoming invisible, Thou comest by again becoming manifest to our eyes.
But unless Thou remainest to direct us how we may still be advancing in
goodness of life, how will the place be prepared where we shall be able
to dwell in the fullness of joy? Let what we have said suffice on the
words which have been read from the Gospel as far as “I will come again,
and receive you to myself.” But the meaning of what follows, “That where
I am, there ye may be also; and whither I go ye know, and the way ye
know,” we shall be in a better condition—after the question put by the
disciple, that follows, and which we also may be putting, as it were,
through him—for hearing, and more suitably situated for making the
subject of our discourse.

<span id="fn_1260"></span>[322:1261](1070071.htm#fr_1260.md) <span
id="iii.lxix-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iii.lxix-p4"></span> The apparent contrariety that Augustin
here deals with, partly arises from a mistaken interpretation of the
second half of verse 2, as given above. His Latin version read, *si quo
minus, dixissem vobis quia vado*,etc., and is a close verbal rendering
of the original text, as found in several <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxix-p4.1"></span>mss</span>.,—<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.lxix-p4.2"></span>εἰ δὲ μὴ, εἶπον ἂν ὑμῖν, ὅτι
πορεύομαι</span>,—although some others omit the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.lxix-p4.3"></span>ὅτι</span>. But while
verbally exact, grammatical accuracy and a fair exegesis will admit of a
pause after <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.lxix-p4.4"></span>ὑμῖν</span> (*vobis*), as the general sense of
the passage requires. <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.lxix-p4.5"></span>῞Οτι</span> might thus be used in the sense of
“because;” or, as it often is, as a particle introducing a direct
statement.—<span class="c10"><span id="iii.lxix-p4.6"></span>Tr</span>.

<span id="fn_1261"></span>[322:1262](1070071.htm#fr_1261.md) <span
id="iii.lxix-p4.7"></span>

<span id="iii.lxix-p5"></span> [Isa. xlv.
11](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011.md)<span id="iii.lxix-p5.1"></span>,
according to the Septuagint, whose reading, as usual, is followed by
Augustin, although here a very manifest mistranslation of the Hebrew.
The words are, “Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel (<span
class="Hebrew"><span id="iii.lxix-p5.2"></span>ויצּרו האיתות
שאלוני</span>) and his Maker, Ask me of things to come,” etc. This is
the rendering really in accordance with the usual Hebrew idiom, with the
sense of the passage itself, and with the frequent use of *Yotser*
(Maker) by Isaiah. It is that also approved by the Masoretic pointing,
and followed generally by the other translations, including the Vulgate,
which has: *plastes ejus: ventura interrogate me*, etc. The LXX.,
however, make *ha’othiyyoth* dependent on *yots’ro* (notwithstanding its
own suffix), instead of the verb that follows, and reads, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.lxix-p5.3"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.lxix-p5.4"></span>ποιήσας</span> (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.lxix-p5.5"></span>αὐτὸν</span> in some
copies) <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.lxix-p5.6"></span>τὰ
ἐπερχόμενα</span>, which Augustin renders in the text: *qui fecit quæ
futura sunt*.—<span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxix-p5.7"></span>Tr</span>.
