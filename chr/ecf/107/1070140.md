<span id="iv.xii-p2"></span><span id="iv.xii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iv.xii-p2.2"></span>1 John IV. 17</span>–2<span
class="c10"><span id="iv.xii-p2.3"></span>1</span>

<span id="iv.xii-p3"></span>“Herein is love made perfect in us, that we
may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as He is, so are we in
this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
Let us love Him, because He first loved us. If a man say, I love God,
and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother
whom he seeth, how can he love God whom he seeth not? And this
commandment have we from Him, That he who loveth God love his brother
also.”

<span id="iv.xii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iv.xii-p4.1"></span>Ye</span> remember, beloved, that of the
epistles of John the apostle the last past remains to be handled by us
and expounded to you, as the Lord vouchsafes. Of this debt then we are
mindful: and ye ought to be mindful of your claim. For indeed this same
charity, which in this epistle is chiefly and almost alone commended, at
once maketh us most faithful in paying our debts, and you most sweet in
exacting your rights. I have said, most sweet in exacting, because where
charity is not, he that exacts is bitter: but where charity is, both he
that exacts is sweet, and he of whom it is exacted, although he
undertakes some labor, yet charity makes the very labor to be almost no
labor, and light. Do we not see how, even in dumb and irrational
animals, where the love is not spiritual but carnal and natural, with
great affection the mother yields herself to her young ones when they
will have the milk which is their right: and however impetuously the
suckling rushes at the teats, yet that is better for the mother than
that it should not suck nor exact that which of love is due? Often we
see great calves driving their heads at the cow’s udders with a force
that almost lifts up the mother’s body, yet does she not kick them off;
nay, if the young one be not there to suck, the lowing of the dam calls
for it to come to the teats. If then there be in us that spiritual
charity of which the apostle saith, “I became small in the midst of you
even as a nurse cherishing her young ones;” <span
id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438.md) we love you the more when ye are
exacting. We like not the sluggish, because for the languid ones we are
afraid. We have been obliged, however, to intermit the continuous
reading of this epistle, because of certain stated lessons coming
between, which must needs be read on their holy days, and the same
preached upon. Let us now come back to the order which was interrupted;
and what remains, holy brethren, receive ye with all attention. I know
not whether charity could be more magnificently commended to us, than
that it should be said, “Charity is God.” <span
id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439.md) Brief praise, yet mighty praise:
brief in utterance, mighty in meaning! How soon is it said, “Love is
God!” This also is short: if thou <span id="page_514">p. 514</span>
<span id="iv.xii-Page_514"></span>count it, it is one: if thou weigh it,
how great is it! “Love is God, and he that dwelleth,” saith he, “in
love, dwelleth in God, and God dwelleth in him.” Let God be thy house,
and be thou an house of God; dwell in God, and let God dwell in thee.
God dwelleth in thee, that He may hold thee: thou dwellest in God, that
thou mayest not fall; for thus saith the apostle of this same charity,
“Charity never falleth.” <span id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440.md) How
should He fall whom God holdeth?

<span id="iv.xii-p8"></span>2. “Herein is our love made perfect in us
that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as He is, so
are we in this world.” <span id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441.md) He
tells how each may prove himself, what progress charity has made in him
or rather what progress he has made in charity. For if charity is God,
God is capable neither of proficiency nor of deficiency: that charity is
said to be making proficiency in thee, means only that thou makest
proficiency in it. Ask therefore what proficiency thou hast made in
charity, and what thine heart will answer thee, that thou mayest know
the measure of thy profiting. For he has promised to show us in what we
may know Him, and hath said, “In this is love made perfect in us.” Ask,
in what? “That we have boldness in the day of judgment.” Whoso hath
boldness in the day of judgment, in that man is charity made perfect.
What is it to have boldness in the day of judgment? Not to fear lest the
day of judgment should come. There are men who do not believe in a day
of judgment; these cannot have boldness in a day which they do not
believe will come. Let us pass these: may God awaken them, that they may
live; why speak we of the dead? They do not believe that there will be a
day of judgment; they neither fear nor desire what they do not believe.
Some man has begun to believe in a day of judgment: if he has begun to
believe, he has also begun to fear. But because he fears as yet, because
he hath not yet boldness in the day of judgment, not yet is charity in
that man made perfect. But for all that, is one to despair? In whom thou
seest the beginning, why despairest thou of the end? What beginning do I
see? (sayest thou.) That very fear. Hear the Scripture: “The fear of the
Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” <span
id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md) Well then, he has begun to fear the
day of judgment: by fearing let him correct himself, let him watch
against his enemies, *i.e.* his sins; let him begin to come to life
again inwardly, and to mortify his members which are upon the earth, as
the apostle saith, “Mortify your members which are upon the
earth.” <span id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443.md) By the members upon
earth he means spiritual wickedness: <span
id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444.md) for he goes on to expound it,
“Covetousness, uncleanness,” <span id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445.md)
and the rest which he there follows out. Now in proportion as this man
who has begun to fear the day of judgment, mortifies his members which
are upon the earth, in that proportion the heavenly members rise up and
are strengthened. But the heavenly members are all good works. As the
heavenly members rise up, he begins to desire that which once he feared.
Once he feared lest Christ should come and find in him the impious whom
He must condemn; now he longs for Him to come, because He shall find the
pious man whom He may crown. Having now begun to desire Christ’s coming,
the chaste soul which desires the embrace of the Bridegroom renounces
the adulterer, becomes a virgin within by faith, hope, and charity. Now
hath the man boldness in the day of judgment: he fights not against
himself when he prays, “Thy kingdom come.” <span
id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446.md) For he that fears lest the kingdom
of God should come, fears lest his prayer be heard. How can he be said
to pray, who fears lest his prayer be heard? But he that prays with
boldness of charity, wishes now that He may come. Of this same desire
said one in the Psalm, “And thou, Lord, how long? Turn, Lord, and
deliver my soul.” <span id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md) He groaned
at being so put off. For there are men who with patience submit to die;
but there are some perfect who with patience endure to live. What do I
mean? When a person still desires this life, that person, when the day
of death comes, patiently endures death: he struggles against himself
that he may follow the will of God, and in his mind desires that which
God chooseth, not what man’s will chooseth: from desire of the present
life there comes a reluctance against death, but yet he takes to him
patience and fortitude, that he may with an even mind meet death; he
dies patiently. But when a man desires, as the apostle saith, “to be
dissolved and to be with Christ,” <span
id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) that person, not patiently dies,
but patiently lives, delightedly dies. See the apostle patiently living,
*i.e.* how with patience he here, not loves life, but endures it. “To be
dissolved,” saith he, “and to be with Christ, is far better: but to
continue in the flesh is necessary for your sakes.” Therefore, brethren,
do your endeavor, settle it inwardly with yourselves to make this your
concern, that ye may desire the day of judgment. No otherwise is charity
proved to be <span id="page_515">p. 515</span> <span
id="iv.xii-Page_515"></span>perfect, but only when one has begun to
desire that day. But that man desires it, who hath boldness in it, whose
conscience feels no alarm in perfect and sincere charity.

<span id="iv.xii-p17"></span>3. “In this is His love perfected in us,
that we may have boldness in the day of judgment.” Why shall we have
boldness? “Because as He is are we also in this world.” Thou hast heard
the ground of thy boldness: “Because as He is,” saith the apostle, “are
we also in this world.” Does he not seem to have said something
impossible? For is it possible for man to be as God? I have already
expounded to you that “*as*” is not always said of equality, but is said
of a certain resemblance. For how sayest thou, *As* I have ears, *so*
has my image? Is it quite *so*? and yet thou sayest “*so, as.*” If then
we were made after God’s image, why are we not *so as* God? Not unto
equality, but relatively to our measure. Whence then are we given
boldness in the day of judgment? “Because as He is, are we also in this
world.” We must refer this to the same charity, and understand what is
meant. The Lord in the Gospel saith, “If ye love them that love you,
what reward shall ye have? do not the publicans this?” <span
id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md) Then what would He have us do? “But
I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute
you.” If then He bids us love our enemies, whence brings He an example
to set before us? From God Himself: for He saith, “That ye may be the
children of your Father which is in heaven.” How doth God this? He
loveth His enemies, “Who maketh His sun to rise upon the good and the
bad, and raineth upon the just and the unjust.” If this then be the
perfection unto which God inviteth us, that we love our enemies as He
loved His; this is our boldness in the day of judgment, that “as He is,
so are we also in this world:” because, as He loveth His enemies in
making His sun to rise upon good and bad, and in sending rain upon the
just and unjust, so we, since we cannot bestow upon them sun and rain,
bestow upon them our tears when we pray for them.

<span id="iv.xii-p19"></span>4. Now therefore concerning this same
boldness, let us see what he says. Whence do we understand that charity
is perfect? “There is no fear in charity.” <span
id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) Then what say we of him that has
begun to fear the day of judgment? If charity in him were perfect, he
would not fear. For perfect charity would make perfect righteousness,
and he would have nothing to fear: nay rather he would have something to
desire; that iniquity may pass away, and God’s kingdom come. So then,
“there is no fear in charity.” But in what charity? Not in charity
begun: in what then? “But perfect charity,” saith he, “casteth out
fear.” Then let fear make the beginning, because “the fear of the Lord
is the beginning of wisdom.” Fear, so to say, prepares a place for
charity. But when once charity has begun to inhabit, the fear which
prepared the place for it is cast out. For in proportion as this
increases, that decreases: and the more this comes to be within, is the
fear cast out. Greater charity, less fear; less charity, greater fear.
But if no fear, there is no way for charity to come in. As we see in
sewing, the thread is introduced by means of the bristle; <span
id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451.md) the bristle first enters, but
except it come out the thread does not come into its place: so fear
first occupies the mind, but the fear does not remain there, because it
enters only in order to introduce charity. When once there is the sense
of security in the mind, what joy have we both in this world and in the
world to come! Even in this world, who shall hurt us, being full of
charity? See how the apostle exults concerning this very charity: “Who
shall separate us from the charity of Christ? shall tribulation, or
distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
sword?” <span id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452.md) And Peter saith: “And
who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers <span
id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453.md) of that which is good?—There is no
fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath
torment.” <span id="fr_2454"></span>[2455](#fn_2454.md) The consciousness
of sins torments the heart: justification has not yet taken place. There
is that in it which itches, which pricks. Accordingly in the Psalm what
saith he concerning this same perfection of righteousness? “Thou hast
turned for me my mourning into joy: Thou hast put off my sackcloth, and
girded me with gladness; to the end that my glory may sing to thee, and
that I be not pricked.” <span id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455.md) What
is this, “That I be not pricked?” That there be not that which shall
goad my conscience. Fear doth goad: but fear not thou: charity enters
in, and she heals the wound that fear inflicts. The fear of God so
wounds as doth the leech’s knife; <span
id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456.md) it takes away the rottenness, and
seems to make the wound greater. Behold, when the rottenness was in the
body, the wound was less, but perilous: then comes the knife; the wound
smarted less than it smarts now while the leech is cutting it. It smarts
more while he is operating upon it than it would if it were <span
id="page_516">p. 516</span> <span id="iv.xii-Page_516"></span>not
operated upon; it smarts more under the healing operation, but only that
it may never smart when the healing is effected. Then let fear occupy
thine heart, that it may bring in charity; let the cicatrice succeed to
the leech’s knife. He is such an Healer, that the cicatrices do not even
appear: only do thou put thyself under His hand. For if thou be without
fear, thou canst not be justified. It is a sentence pronounced by the
Scriptures; “For he that is without fear, cannot be justified.” <span
id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md) Needs then must fear first enter
in, that by it charity may come. Fear is the healing operation: charity,
the sound condition. “But he that feareth is not made perfect in love.”
Why? “Because fear hath torment;” just as the cutting of the surgeon’s
knife hath torment.

<span id="iv.xii-p28"></span>5. But there is another sentence, which
seems contrary to this if it have not one that understands. <span
id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) Namely, it is said in a certain
place of the Psalms, “The fear of the Lord is chaste, enduring
forever.” <span id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md) He shows us an
eternal fear, but *a chaste*. But if he there shows us an eternal fear,
does this epistle perchance contradict him, when it saith, “There is no
fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear?” Let us interrogate
both utterances of God. One is the Spirit, though the books two, though
the mouths two, though the tongues two. For this is said by the mouth of
John, that by the mouth of David: but think not that the Spirit is more
than one. If one breath fills two pipes \[of the double-flute\], cannot
one Spirit fill two hearts, move two tongues? But if two pipes filled by
one breathing sound in unison, can two tongues filled with the Spirit or
Breathing of God make a dissonance? There is then an unison there, there
is a harmony, only it requires one that can hear. Behold, this Spirit of
God hath breathed into and filled two hearts, hath moved two tongues:
and we have heard from the one tongue, “There is no fear in love; but
perfect love casteth out fear;” we have heard from the other, “The fear
of the Lord is chaste, enduring for ever.” How is this? The notes seem
to jar. Not so: rouse thine ears: mark the melody. It is not without
cause that in the one place there is added that word, chaste, in the
other it is not added: but because there is one fear which is called
chaste, and there is another fear which is not called chaste. Let us
mark the difference between these two fears, and so understand the
harmony of the flutes. How are we to understand, or how to distinguish?
Mark, my beloved. There are men who fear God, lest they be cast into
hell, lest haply they burn with the devil in everlasting fire. This is
the fear which introduces charity: but it comes that it may depart. For
if thou as yet fearest God because of punishments, not yet dost thou
love Him whom thou in such sort fearest. Thou dost not desire the good
things, but art afraid of the evil things. Yet because thou art afraid
of the evil things, thou correctest thyself and beginnest to desire the
good things. When once thou hast begun to desire the good, there shall
be in thee the chaste fear. What is the chaste fear? The fear lest thou
lose the good things themselves. Mark! It is one thing to fear God lest
He cast thee into hell with the devil, and another thing to fear God
lest He forsake thee. The fear by which thou fearest lest thou be cast
into hell with the devil, is not yet chaste; for it comes not from the
love of God, but from the fear of punishment: but when thou fearest God
lest His presence forsake thee, thou embracest Him, thou longest to
enjoy God Himself.

<span id="iv.xii-p31"></span>6. One cannot better explain the difference
between these two fears, the one which charity casteth out, the other
chaste, which endureth for ever, than by putting the case of two married
women, one of whom, you may suppose, is willing to commit adultery,
delights in wickedness, only fears lest she be condemned by her husband.
She fears her husband: but because she yet loves wickedness, that is the
reason why she fears her husband. To this woman, the presence of her
husband is not grateful but burdensome; and if it chance she live
wickedly, she fears her husband, lest he should come. Such are they that
fear the coming of the day of judgment. Put the case that the other
loves her husband, that she feels that she owes him chaste embraces,
that she stains herself with no uncleanness of adultery; she wishes for
the presence of her husband. And how are these two fears distinguished?
The one woman fears, the other also fears. Question them: they seem to
make one answer: question the one, Dost thou fear thine husband? she
answers, I do. Question the other, whether she fears her husband; she
answers, I do fear him. The voice is one, the mind diverse. Now then let
them be questioned, Why? The one saith, I fear my husband, lest he
should come: the other saith, I fear my husband, lest he depart from me.
The one saith, I fear to be condemned: the other, I fear to be forsaken.
Let the like have place in the mind of Christians, and thou findest a
fear which love casteth out, and another fear, chaste, enduring for
ever.

<span id="page_517">p. 517</span> <span id="iv.xii-Page_517"></span>

<span id="iv.xii-p32"></span>7. Let us speak then first to these who
fear God, just in the manner of that woman who delights in wickedness;
namely, she fears her husband lest he condemn her; to such let us first
speak. O soul, which fearest God lest He condemn thee, just as the woman
fears, who delights in wickedness: fears her husband, lest she be
condemned by her husband: as thou art displeased at this woman, so be
displeased at thyself. If perchance thou hast a wife, wouldest thou have
thy wife fear thee thus, that she be not condemned by thee? that
delighting in wickedness, she should be repressed only by the weight of
the fear of thee, not by the condemnation of her iniquity? Thou wouldest
have her chaste, that she may love thee, not that she may fear thee.
Show thyself such to God, as thou wouldest have thy wife be to thee. And
if thou hast not yet a wife, and wishest to have one, thou wouldest have
her such. And yet what are we saying, brethren? That woman, whose fear
of her husband is to be condemned by her husband, perhaps does not
commit adultery, lest by some means or other it come to her husband’s
knowledge, and he deprive her of this temporal light of life: now the
husband can be deceived and kept in ignorance; for he is but human, as
she is who can deceive him. She fears him, from whose eyes she can be
hid: and dost thou not fear the face ever upon thee of thine Husband?
“The countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil.”  <span
id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460.md) She catches at her husband’s
absence, and haply is incited by the delight of adultery; and yet she
saith to herself, I will not do it: he indeed is absent, but it is hard
to keep it from coming in some way to his knowledge. She restrains
herself, lest it come to the knowledge of a mortal man, one who, it is
also possible, may never know it, who, it is also possible, may be
deceived, so that he shall esteem a bad woman to be good, esteem her to
be chaste who is an adulteress: and dost thou not fear the eyes of Him
whom no man can deceive? thou not fear the presence of Him who cannot be
turned away from thee? Pray God to look upon thee, and to turn His face
away from thy sins; “Turn away Thy face from my sins.” <span
id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461.md) But whereby dost thou merit that He
should turn away His face from thy sins, if thou turn not away thine own
face from thy sins? For the same voice saith in the Psalm: “For I
acknowledge mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.” <span
id="fr_2462"></span>[2463](#fn_2462.md) Acknowledge thou, and He
forgives. <span id="fr_2463"></span>[2464](#fn_2463.md)

<span id="iv.xii-p37"></span>8. We have addressed that soul which hath
as yet the fear which endureth not for ever, but which love shuts out
and casts forth: let us address that also which hath now the fear which
is chaste, enduring for ever. Shall we find that soul, think you, that
we may address it? think you, is it here in this congregation? is it,
think you, here in this chancel? <span
id="fr_2464"></span>[2465](#fn_2464.md) think you, is it here on earth? It
cannot but be, only it is hidden. Now is the winter: within is the
greenness in the root. Haply we may get at the ears of that soul. But
wherever that soul is, oh that I could find it, and instead of its
giving ear to me, might myself give ear to it! It should teach me
something, rather than learn of me! An holy soul, a soul of fire, and
longing for the kingdom of God: that soul, not I address, but God
Himself doth address, and thus consoleth while patiently it endures to
live here on earth: “Thou wouldest that I should even now come, and I
know that thou wishest I should even now come: I know what thou art,
such that without fear thou mayest wait for mine advent; I know that is
a trouble to thee: but do thou even longer wait, endure; I come, and
come quickly.” But to the loving soul the time moves slowly. Hear her
singing, like a lily as she is from amid the thorns; hear her sighing
and saying, “I will sing, and will understand in a faultless <span
id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465.md) way: when will thou come unto
me?” <span id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466.md) But in a faultless way
well may she not fear; because “perfect love casteth out fear.” And when
He is come to her embrace, still she fears, but <span
id="fr_2467"></span>[2468](#fn_2467.md) in the manner of one that feels
secure. What does she fear? She will beware and take heed to herself
against her own iniquity, that she sin not again: not lest she be cast
into the fire, but lest she be forsaken by Him. And there shall be in in
her—what? the “chaste fear, enduring for ever.” We have heard the two
flutes sounding in unison. That speaks of fear, and this speaks of fear:
but that, of the fear with which the soul fears lest she be condemned;
this, of the fear with which the soul fears lest she be forsaken. <span
id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468.md) That is the fear which charity
casteth out: this, the fear that endureth for ever.

<span id="iv.xii-p43"></span>9. “Let us love, <span
id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469.md) because He first loved us.” <span
id="fr_2470"></span>[2471](#fn_2470.md) For how should we love, except He
had first loved us? By loving we became <span id="page_518">p.
518</span> <span id="iv.xii-Page_518"></span>friends: but He loved us as
enemies, that we might be made friends. He first loved us, and gave us
the gift of loving Him. We did not yet love Him: by loving we are made
beautiful. If a man deformed and ill-featured love a beautiful woman,
what shall he do? Or what shall a woman do, if, being deformed and
ill-featured and black-complexioned, she love a beautiful man? By loving
can she become beautiful? Can he by loving become handsome? He loves a
beautiful woman, and when he sees himself in a mirror, he is ashamed to
lift up his face to her his lovely one of whom he is enamored. What
shall he do that he may be beautiful? Does he wait for good looks to
come? Nay rather, by waiting old age is added to him, and makes him
uglier. There is nothing then to do, there is no way to advise him, but
only that he should restrain himself, and not presume to love unequally:
or if perchance he does love her, and wishes to take her to wife, in her
let him love chastity, not the face of flesh. But our soul, my brethren,
is unlovely by reason of iniquity: by loving God it becomes lovely. What
a love must that be that makes the lover beautiful! But God is always
lovely, never unlovely, never changeable. Who is always lovely first
loved us; and what were we when He loved us but foul and unlovely? But
not to leave us foul; no, but to change us, and of unlovely make us
lovely. How shall we become lovely? By loving Him who is always lovely.
As the love increases in thee, so the loveliness increases: for love is
itself the beauty of the soul. “Let us love, because He first loved us.”
Hear the apostle Paul: “But God showed His love in us, in that while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us:” <span
id="fr_2471"></span>[2472](#fn_2471.md) the just for the unjust, the
beautiful for the foul. How find we Jesus beautiful? “Thou art beauteous
in loveliness surpassing the sons of men; grace is poured upon thy
lips.” <span id="fr_2472"></span>[2473](#fn_2472.md) Why so? Again see why
it is that He is fair; “Beauteous in loveliness surpassing the sons of
men:” because “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.” <span id="fr_2473"></span>[2474](#fn_2473.md) But in
that He took flesh, He took upon Him, as it were, thy foulness, *i.e.*
thy mortality, that He might adapt Himself to thee, and become suited to
thee, and stir thee up to the love of the beauteousness within. Where
then in Scripture do we find Jesus uncomely and deformed, as we have
found Him comely and “beauteous in loveliness surpassing the sons of
men?” where find we Him also deformed? Ask Esaias: “And we saw Him, and
He had no form nor comeliness.”  <span
id="fr_2474"></span>[2475](#fn_2474.md) There now are two flutes which seem
to make discordant sounds: howbeit one Spirit breathes into both. By
this it is said, “Beauteous in loveliness surpassing the sons of men:”
by that it is said in Esaias, “We saw Him, and He had no form nor
comeliness.” By one Spirit are both flutes filled, they make no
dissonance. Turn not away thine ears, apply the understanding. Let us
ask the apostle Paul, and let him expound to us the unison of the two
flutes. Let him sound to us the note, “Beauteous in loveliness
surpassing the sons of men.—Who, being in the form of God, thought it
not robbery to be equal with God.” <span
id="fr_2475"></span>[2476](#fn_2475.md) Let him sound to us also the note,
“We saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness.—He made Himself of no
reputation, taking upon Him the form of a servant, made in the likeness
of men, and in fashion found as man. He had no form nor comeliness,”
that He might give thee form and comeliness. What form? what comeliness?
The love which is in charity: <span id="fr_2476"></span>[2477](#fn_2476.md)
that loving, thou mayest run; <span id="fr_2477"></span>[2478](#fn_2477.md)
running, mayest love. Thou art fair now: but stay not thy regard upon
thyself, lest thou lose what thou hast received; let thy regards
terminate in Him by whom thou wast made fair. Be thou fair only to the
end He may love thee. But do thou direct thy whole aim to Him, run thou
to Him, seek His embraces, fear to depart from Him; that there may be in
thee the chaste fear, which endureth for ever. “Let us love, because He
first loved us.”

<span id="iv.xii-p53"></span>10. “If any man say, I love God.” <span
id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478.md) What God? <span
id="fr_2479"></span>[2480](#fn_2479.md) wherefore love we? “Because He
first loved us,” and gave us to love. He loved us ungodly, to make us
godly; loved us unrighteous, to make us righteous; loved us sick, to
make us whole. Ask each several man; let him tell thee if he love God.
He cries out, he confesses: *I love*, God knoweth. There is another
question to be asked. “If any man say, I love God, and hateth his
brother, he is a liar.” By what provest thou that he is a liar? Hear.
“For he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can he love God
whom he seeth not?” What then? does he that loves a brother, love God
also? He must of necessity love God, must of necessity love Him that is
Love itself. Can one love his brother, and not love Love? Of necessity
he must love Love. What then? because he loves Love, does it follow that
he loves God? Certainly it does follow. In <span id="page_519">p.
519</span> <span id="iv.xii-Page_519"></span>loving Love, he loves God.
Or hast thou forgotten what thou saidst a little while ago, “Love is
God”? <span id="fr_2480"></span>[2481](#fn_2480.md) If “Love is God,” whoso
loveth Love, loveth God. Love then thy brother, and feel thyself
assured. Thou canst not say, “I love my brother, but I do not love God.”
As thou liest, if thou sayest “I love God,” when thou lovest not thy
brother, so thou art deceived when thou sayest, I love my brother, if
thou think that thou lovest not God. Of necessity must thou who lovest
thy brother, love Love itself: but “Love is God:” therefore of necessity
must he love God, whoso loveth his brother. But if thou love not the
brother whom thou seest, how canst thou love God whom thou seest not?
Why does he not see God? Because he has not Love itself. That he does
not see God, is, because he has not love: that he has not love, is,
because he loves not his brother. The reason then why he does not see
God, is, that he has not Love. For if he have Love, he sees God, for
“Love is God:” and that eye is becoming more and more purged by love, to
see that Unchangeable Substance, in the presence of which he shall
always rejoice, which he shall enjoy to everlasting, when he is joined
with the angels. Only, let him run now, that he may at last have
gladness in his own country. Let him not love his pilgrimage, not love
the way: let all be bitter save Him that calleth us, until we hold Him
fast, and say what is said in the Psalm: “Thou hast destroyed all that
go a-whoring from Thee” <span id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481.md) —and
who are they that go a-whoring? they that go away and love the world:
but what shalt thou do? he goes on and says:—“but for me it is good to
cleave to God.” All my good is, to cling unto God, freely. For if thou
question him and say, For what dost thou cling to Him? and he should
say, That He may give me—Give thee what? It is He that made the heaven,
He that made the earth: what shall He give thee? Already thou are
cleaving to Him: find something better, and He shall give it thee.

<span id="iv.xii-p58"></span>11. “For he that loveth not his brother
whom he seeth, how can he love God whom he seeth not? And this
commandment have we from Him, that he who loveth God love his brother
also.” <span id="fr_2482"></span>[2483](#fn_2482.md) Marvellous fine talk
it was, that thou didst say, “I love God,” and hatest thy brother! O
murderer, how lovest thou God? Hast thou not heard above in this very
epistle, “He that hateth his brother is a murderer”? <span
id="fr_2483"></span>[2484](#fn_2483.md) Yea, but I do verily love God,
however I hate my brother. Thou dost verily not love God, if thou hate
thy brother. And now I make it good by another proof. This same apostle
hath said, “He gave us commandment that we should love one another.” How
canst thou be said to love Him whose commandment thou hatest? Who shall
say, I love the emperor, but I hate his laws? In this the emperor
understands whether thou love him, that his laws be observed throughout
the provinces. Our Emperor’s law, what is it? “A new commandment give I
unto you, that ye love one another.” <span
id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484.md) Thou sayest then, that thou lovest
Christ: keep His commandment, and love thy brother. But if thou love not
thy brother, how canst thou be said to love Him whose commandment thou
despisest? Brethren, I am never satiated in speaking of charity in the
name of the Lord. In what proportion ye have an insatiable desire of
this thing, in that proportion we hope the thing itself is growing in
you, and casting out fear, that so there may remain that chaste fear
which is for ever permanent. Let us endure the world, endure
tribulations, endure the stumbling-blocks of temptations. Let us not
depart from the way; let us hold the unity of the Church, hold Christ,
hold charity. Let us not be plucked away from the members of His Spouse,
not be plucked away from faith, that we may glory in His coming: and we
shall securely abide in Him, now by faith, then by sight, of whom we
have so great earnest, even the gift of the Holy Spirit.
