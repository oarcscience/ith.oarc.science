<span id="iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Homily IV.</span>

<span id="iv.vii-p2"></span><span id="iv.vii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iv.vii-p2.2"></span>1 John II. 27</span>–<span
class="c10"><span id="iv.vii-p2.3"></span>III. 8</span>

<span id="iv.vii-p3"></span>*“And it is true, and lieth not. Even as it
hath taught you, abide in it. And now, little children, abide in Him;
that, when He shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be put to
shame by Him at His coming. If ye know that He is righteous, know ye
that every one that doeth righteousness is born of Him. Behold, what
manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be
called and should be the sons of God:* <span id="page_482">p. 482</span>
<span id="iv.vii-Page_482"></span>*therefore the world knoweth us not,
because it knew not Him, us also the world knoweth not. Beloved, now are
we the sons of God, and it is not yet manifested what we shall be. We
know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see
Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope in Him purifieth
himself, even as He is pure. Whosoever committeth sin committeth also
iniquity. Sin is iniquity. And ye know that He was manifested to take
away sin; and in Him is no sin. Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not:
whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known Him. Little children,
let no man seduce you. He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as
He is righteous. He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil
sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was
manifested; that He might destroy the works of the devil.”*

<span id="iv.vii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iv.vii-p4.1"></span>Ye</span> remember, brethren, that yesterday’s
lesson was brought to a close at this point, that “ye have no need that
any man teach you, but the unction itself teacheth you concerning all
things.” Now this, as I am sure ye remember, we so expounded to you,
that we who from without speak to your ears, are as workmen applying
culture from without to a tree, but we cannot give the increase nor form
the fruits: but only He that created and redeemed and called you, He,
dwelling in you by faith and the Spirit, must speak to you within, else
vain is all our noise of words. Whence does this appear? From this: that
while many hear, not all are persuaded of that which is said, but only
they to whom God speaks within. Now they to whom He speaks within, are
those who give place to Him: and those give place to God, who “give not
place to the devil.” <span id="fr_2184"></span>[2185](#fn_2184.md) For the
devil wishes to inhabit the hearts of men, and speak there the things
which are able to seduce. But what saith the Lord Jesus? “The prince of
this world is cast out.” <span id="fr_2185"></span>[2186](#fn_2185.md)
Whence cast? out of heaven and earth? out of the fabric of the world?
Nay, but out of the hearts of the believing. The invader being cast out,
let the Redeemer dwell within: because the same redeemed, who created.
And the devil now assaults from without, not conquers Him that hath
possession within. And he assaults from without, by casting in various
temptations: but that person consents not thereto, to whom God speaks
within, and the unction of which ye have heard.

<span id="iv.vii-p7"></span>2. “And it is true,” namely, this same
unction; *i.e.* the very Spirit of the Lord which teacheth men, cannot
lie: “and is not false. <span id="fr_2186"></span>[2187](#fn_2186.md) Even
as it hath taught you, abide ye in the same. And now, little children,
abide ye in Him, that when He shall be manifested, we may have boldness
in His sight, that we be not put to shame by Him at His coming.” <span
id="fr_2187"></span>[2188](#fn_2187.md) Ye see, brethren: we believe on
Jesus whom we have not seen: they announced Him, that saw, that handled,
that heard the word out of His own mouth; and that they might persuade
all mankind of the truth thereof, they were sent by Him, not dared to go
of themselves. And whither were they sent? Ye heard while the Gospel was
read, “Go, preach the Gospel to the whole creation which is under
heaven.” <span id="fr_2188"></span>[2189](#fn_2188.md) Consequently, the
disciples were sent “every where:” with signs and wonders to attest that
what they spake, they had seen. And we believe on Him whom we have not
seen, and we look for Him to come. Whoso look for Him by faith, shall
rejoice when He cometh: those who are without faith, when that which now
they see not is come, shall be ashamed. And that confusion of face shall
not be for a single day and so pass away, in such sort as those are wont
to be confounded, who are found out in some fault, and are scoffed at by
their fellowmen. That confusion shall carry them that are confounded to
the left hand, that to them it may be said, “Go into everlasting fire,
prepared for the devil and his angels.” <span
id="fr_2189"></span>[2190](#fn_2189.md) Let us abide then in His words,
that we be not confounded when He cometh. For Himself saith in the
Gospel to them that had believed on Him: “If ye shall abide in my word,
then are ye verily my disciples.” <span
id="fr_2190"></span>[2191](#fn_2190.md) And, as if they had asked, With
what fruit? “And,” saith He, “ye shall know the truth, and the truth
shall make you free.” For as yet our salvation is in hope, not in deed:
for we do not already possess that which is promised, but we hope for it
to come. And “faithful is He that promised;” <span
id="fr_2191"></span>[2192](#fn_2191.md) He deceiveth not thee: only do thou
not faint, but wait for the promise. For He, the Truth, cannot deceive.
Be not thou a liar, to profess one thing and do another; keep thou the
faith, and He keeps His promise. But if thou keep not the faith, thine
own self, not He that promised, hath defrauded thee.

<span id="page_483">p. 483</span> <span id="iv.vii-Page_483"></span>

<span id="iv.vii-p14"></span>3. “If ye know that He is righteous, know
ye <span id="fr_2192"></span>[2193](#fn_2192.md) that every one that doeth
righteousness is born of Him.” <span
id="fr_2193"></span>[2194](#fn_2193.md) The righteousness which at present
is ours is of faith. Perfect righteousness is not, save only in the
angels: and scarce in angels, if they be compared with God: yet if there
be any perfect righteousness of souls and spirits which God hath
created, it is in the angels, holy, just, good, by no lapse turned
aside, by no pride falling, but remaining ever in the contemplation of
the Word of God, and having nothing else sweet unto them save Him by
whom they were created; in them is perfect righteousness: but in us it
has begun to be, of faith, by the Spirit. Ye heard when the Psalm was
read, “Begin <span id="fr_2194"></span>[2195](#fn_2194.md) ye to the Lord
in confession.” <span id="fr_2195"></span>[2196](#fn_2195.md) “Begin,”
saith it; the beginning of our righteousness is the confession of sins.
Thou hast begun not to defend thy sin; now hast thou made a beginning of
righteousness: but it shall be perfected in thee when to do nothing else
shall delight thee, when “death shall be swallowed up in victory,” <span
id="fr_2196"></span>[2197](#fn_2196.md) when there shall be no itching of
lust, when there shall be no struggling with flesh and blood, when there
shall be the palm of victory, the triumph over the enemy; then shall
there be perfect righteousness. At present we are still fighting: if we
fight we are in the lists; <span id="fr_2197"></span>[2198](#fn_2197.md) we
smite and are smitten; but who shall conquer, remains to be seen. And
that man conquers, who even when he smites presumes not on his own
strength, but relies upon God that cheers him on. The devil is alone
when he fights against us. If we are with God, we overcome the devil:
for if thou fight alone with the devil, thou wilt be overcome. He is a
skillful enemy: how may palms has he won! Consider to what he has cast
us down! That we are born mortal, comes of this, that he in the first
place cast down from Paradise our very original. What then is to be
done, seeing he is so well practised? Let the Almighty be invoked to
thine aid against the devices of the devil. Let Him dwell in thee, who
cannot be overcome, and thou shalt securely overcome him who is wont to
overcome. But to overcome whom? Those in whom God dwelleth not. For,
that ye may know it, brethren; Adam being in Paradise despised the
commandment of God, and lifted up the neck, as if he desired to be his
own master, and were loath to be subject to the will of God: so he fell
from that immortality, from that blessedness. But there was a certain
man, a man now well skilled, though a mortal born, who even as he sat on
the dunghill, putrifying with worms, overcame the devil: yea, Adam
himself then overcame: even he, in Job; because Job was of his race. So
then, Adam, overcome in Paradise, overcame on the dunghill. Being in
Paradise, he gave ear to the persuasion of the woman which the devil had
put into her: but being on the dunghill he said to Eve, “Thou hast
spoken as one of the foolish women.” <span
id="fr_2198"></span>[2199](#fn_2198.md) There he lent an ear, here he gave
an answer: when he was glad, he listened, when he was scourged, he
overcame. Therefore, see what follows, my brethren, in the Epistle:
because this is what it would have us lay to heart, that we may overcome
the devil indeed, but not of ourselves. “If ye know that He is
righteous,” saith it, “know ye that every one that doeth righteousness
is born of Him:” of God, of Christ. And in that he hath said, “Is born
of Him,” he cheers us on. Already therefore, in that we are born of Him,
we are perfect.

<span id="iv.vii-p22"></span>4. Hear. “Behold what manner of love the
Father hath given us, that we should be called sons of God, and be <span
id="fr_2199"></span>[2200](#fn_2199) (such.md).” <span
id="fr_2200"></span>[2201](#fn_2200.md) For whoso are called sons, and are
not sons, what profiteth them the name where the thing is not? How many
are called physicians, who know not how to heal! how many are called
watchers, who sleep all night long! So, many are called Christians, and
yet in deeds are not found such; because they are not this which they
are called, that is, in life, in manners, in faith, in hope, in charity.
But what have ye heard here, brethren? “Behold, what manner of love the
Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called, and should be,
the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it hath not
known Him, us also the world knoweth not.” <span
id="fr_2201"></span>[2202](#fn_2201.md) There is a whole world Christian,
and a whole world ungodly; because throughout the whole world there are
ungodly, and throughout the whole world there are godly: those know not
these. In what sense, think we, do they not know them? They deride them
that live good lives. Mark well and <span id="page_484">p. 484</span>
<span id="iv.vii-Page_484"></span>see: for haply there are such also
among you. Each one of you who now lives godly, who despises worldly
things, who does not choose to go to spectacles, who does not choose to
make himself drunken as it were by solemn custom, yea, what is worse,
under countenance of holy days to make himself unclean: the man who does
not choose to do these things, how is he derided by those who do
them! <span id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202.md) Would he be scoffed at
if he were known? But why is he not known? “The world knoweth Him not.”
Who is “the world”? Those inhabiters of the world. Just as we say, “a
house;” meaning, its inhabitants. These things have been said to you
again and again, and we forbear to repeat them to your disgust. By this
time, when ye hear the word “world,” in a bad signification, ye know
that ye must understand it to mean only lovers of the world because
through love they inhabit, and by inhabiting have become entitled to the
name. Therefore the world hath not known us, because it hath not known
Him. He walked here Himself, the Lord Jesus Christ in the flesh; He was
God, He was latent in weakness. <span
id="fr_2203"></span>[2204](#fn_2203.md) And wherefore was He not known?
Because He reproved all sins in men. They, through loving the delights
of sins, did not acknowledge the God: through loving that which the
fever prompted, they did wrong to the Physician.

<span id="iv.vii-p29"></span>5. For us then, what are we? Already we are
begotten of Him; but because we are such in hope, he saith, “Beloved,
now are we sons of God.” Now already? Then what is it we look for, if
already we are sons of God? “And not yet,” saith he, “is it manifested
what <span id="fr_2204"></span>[2205](#fn_2204.md) we shall be.” But what
else shall we be than sons of God? Hear what follows: “We know that,
when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as
He is.” Understand, my beloved. It is a great matter: “We know that,
when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He
is.” In the first place mark, what is called “Is.” Ye know what it is
that is so called. That which is called “Is,” and not only is called but
is so, is unchangeable: It ever remaineth, It cannot be changed, It is
in no part corruptible: It hath neither proficiency, for It is perfect;
nor hath deficiency, for It is eternal. And what is this? “In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God.” <span id="fr_2205"></span>[2206](#fn_2205.md) And what is this? “Who
being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with
God.” <span id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206.md) To see Christ in this
sort, Christ in the form of God, Word of God, Only-Begotten of the
Father, equal with the Father, is to the bad impossible. But in regard
that the Word was made flesh, the bad also shall have power to see Him:
because in the day of judgment the bad also will see Him; for He shall
so come to judge, as He came to be judged. In the selfsame form, a man,
but yet God: for “cursed is every one that putteth his trust in man.”
 <span id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207.md) A man, He came to be judged,
a man, He will come to judge. And if He shall not be seen, what is this
that is written, “They shall look on Him whom they pierced?” <span
id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208.md) For of the ungodly it is said, that
they shall see and be confounded. How shall the ungodly not see, when He
shall set some on the right hand, others on the left? To those on the
right hand He will say, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, receive the
kingdom:” <span id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209.md) to those on the
left He will say, “Go into everlasting fire.” They will see but the form
of a servant, the form of God they will not see. Why? because they were
ungodly; and the Lord Himself saith, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for
they shall see God.” <span id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210.md)
Therefore, we are to see a certain vision, my brethren, “which neither
eye hath seen, nor ear hath heard, nor hath entered into the heart of
man:” <span id="fr_2211"></span>[2212](#fn_2211.md) a certain vision, a
vision surpassing all earthly beautifulness, of gold, of silver, of
groves and fields; the beautifulness of sea and air, the beautifulness
of sun and moon, the beautifulness of the stars, the beautifulness of
angels: surpassing all things: because from it are all things beautiful.

<span id="iv.vii-p38"></span>6. What then shall “we” be, when we shall
see this? What is promised to us? “We shall be like Him, for we shall
see Him as He is.” The tongue hath done what it could, hath sounded the
words: let the rest be thought by the heart. For what hath even John
himself said in comparison of That which Is, or what can be said by us
men, who are so far from being equal to his merits? Return we therefore
to that unction of Him, return we to that unction which inwardly
teacheth that which we cannot speak: and because ye cannot at present
see, let your part and duty be in desire. The whole life of a good
Christian is an holy desire. <span id="fr_2212"></span>[2213](#fn_2212.md)
Now <span id="page_485">p. 485</span> <span
id="iv.vii-Page_485"></span>what thou longest for, thou dost not yet
see: howbeit by longing, thou art made capable, so that when that is
come which thou mayest see, thou shall be filled. For just as, if thou
wouldest fill a bag, <span id="fr_2213"></span>[2214](#fn_2213.md) and
knowest how great the thing is that shall be given, thou stretchest the
opening of the sack or the skin, or whatever else it be; thou knowest
how much thou wouldest put in, and seest that the bag is narrow; by
stretching thou makest it capable of holding more: so God, by deferring
our hope, stretches our desire; by the desiring, stretches the mind; by
stretching, makes it more capacious. Let us desire therefore, my
brethren, for we shall be filled. See Paul widening, as it were, <span
id="fr_2214"></span>[2215](#fn_2214.md) his bosom, that it may be able to
receive that which is to come. He saith, namely, “Not that I have
already received, or am already perfect: brethren, I deem not myself to
have apprehended.” <span id="fr_2215"></span>[2216](#fn_2215.md) Then what
art thou doing in this life, if thou have not yet apprehended? “But this
one thing \[I do\]; forgetting the things that are behind, reaching
forth to the things that are before, <span
id="fr_2216"></span>[2217](#fn_2216.md) upon the strain I follow on unto
the prize of the high calling.” He says he reaches forth, or stretches
himself, and says that he follows “upon the strain.” He felt himself too
little to take in that “which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
hath entered into the heart of man.” <span
id="fr_2217"></span>[2218](#fn_2217.md) This is our life, that by longing
we should be exercised. But holy longing exercises us just so much as we
prune off our longings from the love of the world. We have already said,
“Empty out that which is to be filled.” With good thou art to be filled:
pour out the bad. Suppose that God would fill thee with honey: if thou
art full of vinegar, where wilt thou put the honey? That which the
vessel bore in it must be poured out: the vessel itself must be
cleansed; must be cleansed, albeit with labor, albeit with hard rubbing,
that it may become fit for that thing, whatever it be. Let us say honey,
say gold, say wine; whatever we say it is, being that which cannot be
said, whatever we would fain say, It is called—God. And when we say
“God,” what have we said? Is that one syllable the whole of that we look
for? So then, whatever we have had power to say is beneath Him: let us
stretch ourselves unto Him, that when He shall come, He may fill us. For
“we shall be like Him; because we shall see Him as He is.”

<span id="iv.vii-p45"></span>7. “And every one that hath this hope in
Him.” Ye see how he hath set us our place, in “hope.” Ye see how the
Apostle Paul agreeth with his fellow-apostle, “By hope we are saved. But
hope that is seen, is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he hope
for? For if what we see not, we hope for, by patience we wait for
it.” <span id="fr_2218"></span>[2219](#fn_2218.md) This very patience
exerciseth desire. Continue thou, for He continueth: and persevere thou
in walking, that thou mayest reach the goal: for that to which thou
tendest will not remove. See: “And every one that hath this hope in Him,
purifieth <span id="fr_2219"></span>[2220](#fn_2219.md) himself even as He
is pure.” <span id="fr_2220"></span>[2221](#fn_2220.md) See how he has not
taken away free-will, in that he saith, “purifieth himself.” Who
purifieth us but God? Yea, but God doth not purify thee if thou be
unwilling. Therefore, in that thou joinest thy will to God, in that thou
purifiest thyself. Thou purifiest thyself, not by thyself, but by Him
who cometh to inhabit thee. Still, because thou doest somewhat therein
by the will, therefore is somewhat attributed to thee. But it is
attributed to thee only to the end thou shouldest say, as in the Psalm,
“Be thou my helper, forsake me not.” <span
id="fr_2221"></span>[2222](#fn_2221.md) If thou sayest, “Be thou my
helper,” thou doest somewhat: for if thou be doing nothing, how should
He be said to “help” thee?

<span id="iv.vii-p50"></span>8. “Every one that doeth sin, doeth also
iniquity.” <span id="fr_2222"></span>[2223](#fn_2222.md) Let no man say,
Sin is one thing, iniquity another: let no man say, I am a sinful man,
but not <span id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223.md) a doer of iniquity.
For, “Every one that doeth sin, doeth also iniquity. Sin is iniquity.”
Well then, what are we to do concerning sins and iniquities? Hear what
He saith: “And ye know that He was manifested to take away sin; and sin
in Him is not.” <span id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224.md) He, in Whom
sin is not, the same is come to take away sin. For were there sin in
Him, it must be taken away from Him, not He take it away Himself.
“Whosoever abideth in Him, sinneth not.” <span
id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225.md) In so far as he abideth in Him, in
so far sinneth not. “Whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known
Him.” A great question this: “Whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him,
neither known Him.” No marvel. We have not seen Him, but are to see;
have not known Him, but are to know: we believe on One we have not
known. Or haply, by faith we have known, and by actual beholding <span
id="fr_2226"></span>[2227](#fn_2226.md) have not yet known? But then in
faith we have both seen and known. For if faith doth not yet see, why
are we said to have been enlightened? There is an enlightening by faith,
and an enlightening by sight. At present, while we are on pilgrimage,
“we walk by faith, not by sight,” <span
id="fr_2227"></span>[2228](#fn_2227.md) <span id="page_486">p. 486</span>
<span id="iv.vii-Page_486"></span>or, actually beholding. Therefore also
our righteousness is “by faith, not by sight.” Our righteousness shall
be perfect, when we shall see by actual beholding. <span
id="fr_2228"></span>[2229](#fn_2228.md) Only, in the meanwhile, let us not
leave that righteousness which is of faith, since “the just doth live by
faith,” <span id="fr_2229"></span>[2230](#fn_2229.md) as saith the apostle.
“Whosoever abideth in Him, sinneth not.” For, “whosoever sinneth, hath
not seen Him, neither known Him.” That man who sins, believes not: but
if a man believes, so far as pertains to his faith, he sinneth not.

<span id="iv.vii-p59"></span>9. “Little children, let no man seduce you.
He that doeth righteousness is righteous, as He is righteous.” <span
id="fr_2230"></span>[2231](#fn_2230.md) What, on hearing that we are
“righteous as He is righteous,” are we to think ourselves equal with
God? Ye must know what means that “as:” thus he said a while ago,
“Purifieth himself even as He is pure.” Then is our purity like and
equal to the purity of God, and our righteousness to God’s
righteousness? Who can say this? But the word “as,” is not always wont
to be used in the sense of equality. As, for example, if, having seen
this large church,  <span id="fr_2231"></span>[2232](#fn_2231.md) a person
should wish to build a smaller church, but with the same relative
dimensions: as, for example, if this be one measure in width and two
measures in length, he too should build his church one measure in width
and two measures in length: in that case one sees that he has built it
“as” this is built. But this church has, say, a hundred cubits in
length, the other thirty: it is at once “as” this, and yet unequal. Ye
see that this “as” is not always referred to parity and equality. For
example, see what a difference there is between the face of a man and
its image from a mirror: there is a face in the image, a face in the
body: the image exists in imitation, the body in reality. And what do we
say? Why, “as” there are eyes here, so also there; “as” ears here, so
ears also there. The thing is different, but the “as” is said of the
resemblance. Well then, we also have in us the image of God; but not
that which the Son equal with the Father hath: yet except we also,
according to our measure, were “as” He, we should in no respect be said
to be like Him. “He purifieth us,” then, “even as He is pure:” but He is
pure from eternity, we pure by faith. We are “righteous even as He is
righteous;” but He is so in His immutable perpetuity, we righteous by
believing on One we do not see, that so we may one day see Him. Even
when our righteousness shall be perfect, when we shall be equal to the
angels, not even then shall it be equalled with Him. How far then is it
from Him now, when not even then it shall be equal!

<span id="iv.vii-p62"></span>10. “He that doeth sin, is of the devil,
because the devil sinneth from the beginning.” <span
id="fr_2232"></span>[2233](#fn_2232.md) “Is of the devil:” ye know what he
means: by imitating the devil. For the devil made no man, begat no man,
created no man: but whoso imitates the devil, that person, as if
begotten of him, becomes a child of the devil; by imitating him, not
literally by being begotten of him. In what sense art thou a child of
Abraham, not that Abraham begat thee? In the same sense as the Jews, the
children of Abraham, not imitating the faith of Abraham, are become
children of the devil: of the flesh of Abraham they were begotten, and
the faith of Abraham they have not imitated. If then those who were
thence begotten were put out of the inheritance, because they did not
imitate, thou, who art not begotten of him, art made a child, and in
this way shall be a child of him by imitating him. And if thou imitate
the devil, in such wise as he became proud and impious against God, thou
wilt be a child of the devil: by imitating, not that he created thee or
begat thee.

<span id="iv.vii-p64"></span>11. “Unto this end was the Son of God
manifested.” Now then, brethren, mark! All sinners are begotten of the
devil, as sinners. Adam was made by God: but when he consented to the
devil, he was begotten of the devil; and he begat all men such as he was
himself. With lust itself we were born; even before we add our sins,
from that condemnation we have our birth. For if we are born without any
sin, wherefore this running with infants to baptism that they may be
released? Then mark well, brethren, the two birth-stocks, <span
id="fr_2233"></span>[2234](#fn_2233.md) Adam and Christ: two men are; but
one of them, a man that is man; the other, a Man that is God. By the man
that is man we are sinners; by the Man that is God we are justified.
That birth hath cast down unto death; this birth hath raised up unto
life: that birth brings with it sin; this birth setteth free from sin.
For to this end came Christ as Man, to undo <span
id="fr_2234"></span>[2235](#fn_2234.md) the sins of men. “Unto this end was
the Son of God manifested, that He may undo the works of the devil.”

<span id="iv.vii-p67"></span>12. The rest I commend to your thoughts, my
beloved, that I may not burden you. For the question we labor to solve
is even this—that we call ourselves sinners: for if any man shall say
that he is without sin, he is a liar. And in the Epistle of this same
John we have found it written, “If we say that we <span id="page_487">p.
487</span> <span id="iv.vii-Page_487"></span>have no sin, we deceive
ourselves.” <span id="fr_2235"></span>[2236](#fn_2235.md) For ye should
remember what went before: “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” And yet, on the other hand, in
what follows thou art told, “He that is begotten of God sinneth not: he
that doeth sin hath not seen Him, neither known Him.—Every one that
doeth sin is of the devil:” sin is not of God: this affrights us again.
In what sense are we begotten of God, and in what sense do we confess
ourselves sinners? Shall we say, because we are not begotten of God? And
what do these Sacraments in regard to infants? What hath John said? “He
that is begotten of God, sinneth not.” And yet again the same John hath
said, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us!” A great question it is, and an embarrassing one;
and may I have made you intent upon having it solved, my beloved.
Tomorrow, in the name of the Lord, what He will give, we will discourse
thereof.

place: *Qui vocantur et non sunt, quid prodest illis nomen*? \[The very
words of this passage.\] *Verum hic loquitur de nomine quod a Deo

rather like an expression of dissent, by Mill himself or some other.\]

of which there are no traces in the <span class="c10"><span

gloss: “therefore (because we are sons of God) the world knoweth us not.

*ambulare*, without an object.—J.H.M.\] *ambulabat* seems to require an
object to complete the sense, and the antithesis between *erat* and
