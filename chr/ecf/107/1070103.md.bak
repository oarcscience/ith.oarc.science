<span id="iii.ci-p2"></span><span id="iii.ci-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.ci-p2.2"></span>Chapter XVI. 13–15
(</span>*continued*).

<span id="iii.ci-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.ci-p3.1"></span>When</span> our Lord gave the promise of the
coming of His Holy Spirit, He said, “He shall teach you all truth,” or,
as we read in some copies, “He shall guide you into all truth. For He
shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He
speak.” On these Gospel words we have already discoursed as the Lord
enabled us; and now give your attention to those that follow. “And He
will show you,” He said, “things to come.” Over this, which is perfectly
plain, there is no need to linger; for it contains no question that
demands from us any regular exposition. But the words that He proceeds
to add, “He shall make me clearly known; <span
id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650.md) for He shall receive of mine, and
shall show it unto you,” are not to be carelessly passed over. For by
the words, “He shall make me clearly known,” we may understand, that by
shedding abroad \[God’s\] love in the hearts of believers, and making
them spiritual, He showed them how it was that the Son was equal to the
Father, whom previously they had only known according to the flesh, and
as men themselves had thought of Him only as man. Or at least that,
filled themselves through that very love with boldness, and divested of
all fear, they might proclaim Christ unto men; and so His fame be spread
abroad through the whole world. So that He said, “He shall make me
clearly known,” as if meaning, He shall free you from fear, and endow
you with a love that will so inflame your zeal in preaching me, that you
will send forth the odor, and commend the honor of, my glory throughout
the world. For what they were to do in the Holy Spirit, He said that the
Spirit Himself would also do, as is implied in the words, “For it is not
ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in
you.” <span id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651.md) The Greek word, indeed,
which is <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.ci-p5.2"></span>
δοξάσει</span>, has been rendered by the Latin interpreters in their
respective translations, *clarificabit* (“shall make clearly known”) by
one, and *glorificabit* (“shall glorify”) by another: for the idea
expressed in Greek by the one term <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ci-p5.3"></span>δόξα</span>, from which is derived the verb
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.ci-p5.4"></span> δοξάσει</span>, may
be interpreted both by *claritas* (brightness) and *gloria* (glory). For
by glory every one becomes bright, and glorious by brightness; and hence
what is signified by both words, is one and the same thing. And, as the
most famous writers of the Latin tongue in olden time have defined it,
glory is the generally diffused and accepted fame of any one accompanied
with praise. But when this happened in the world in regard to Christ, we
are not to suppose that it was the bestowing of any great thing on
Christ, but on the world. For to praise what is good is not of benefit
to that which receives, but to those who give the commendation.

<span id="iii.ci-p6"></span>2. But there is also a false glory, when the
praise given is the result of a mistake, whether in regard to things or
to persons, or to both. For men are mistaken in regard to things, when
they think that to be good which is evil; and in regard to persons, when
they think one to be good who is evil; and in regard to both, when what
is actually a vice is esteemed a virtue; and when he who is praised for
something is destitute of what he is supposed to have, whether he be
good or evil. To credit vain-glorious persons <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652.md) with the things they profess, is
surely a huge vice, and not a virtue; and yet you know how common is the
laudatory fame of such; for, as Scripture says, “The sinner is praised
in the desires of his soul, and he who practises iniquity is
blessed.” <span id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653.md) Here those who
praise are not mistaken in the persons, but in the things; for that is
evil which they believe to be good. But those who are morally corrupted
with the evil of prodigality are undoubtedly such as those who praise
them do not simply suspect, but perceive them to be. But further, if one
feign himself a just man, and be not so, but, as regards all that he
seems to do in a praiseworthy way in the sight of men, does it not for
God’s sake, that is, for the sake of true righteousness, but makes glory
from men the only glory he seeks and hankers after; while those with
whom his extolled fame is generally accepted think of him only as living
in a <span id="page_386">p. 386</span> <span
id="iii.ci-Page_386"></span>praiseworthy way for God’s sake,—they are
not mistaken in the thing, but are deceived in the person. For that
which they believe to be good, is good; but the person whom they believe
to be good, is the reverse. But if, for example, skill in magical arts
be esteemed good, and any one, so long as he is believed to have
delivered his country by those same arts whereof all the while he is
utterly ignorant, attain amongst the irreligious to that generally
accepted renown which is defined as glory, those who so praise err in
both respects; to wit, both in the thing, for they esteem that good
which is evil; and in the person, for he is not at all what they suppose
him. But when, in regard to any one who is righteous by God’s grace and
for God’s sake, in other words, truly righteous, there is on account of
that very righteousness a generally accepted fame of a laudatory kind,
then the glory is indeed a true one; and yet we are not to suppose that
thereby the righteous man is made blessed, but rather those who praise
him are to be congratulated, because they judge rightly, and love the
righteous. And how much more, then, did Christ the Lord, by His own
glory, benefit, not Himself, but those whom He also benefited by His
death?

<span id="iii.ci-p9"></span>3. But that is not a true glory which He has
among heretics, with whom, nevertheless, He appears to have a generally
accepted fame accompanied with praise. Such is no true glory, because in
both respects they are mistaken, for they both think that to be good
which is not good, and they suppose Christ to be what Christ is not. For
to say that the only-begotten Son is not equal to Him that begat, is not
good: to say that the only-begotten Son of God is man only, and not God,
is not good: to say that the flesh of the Truth is not true flesh, is
not good. Of the three doctrines which I have stated, the first is held
by the Arians, the second by the Photinians, and the third by the
Manicheans. But inasmuch as there is nothing in any of them that is
good, and Christ has nothing to do with them, in both respects they are
in the wrong; and they attach no true glory to Christ, although there
may appear to be amongst them a generally accepted fame regarding Christ
of a laudatory character. And accordingly all heretics together, whom it
would be too tedious to enumerate, who have not right views regarding
Christ, err on this account, that their views are untrue regarding both
good things and evil. The pagans, also, of whom great numbers are
lauders of Christ, are themselves also mistaken in both respects,
saying, as they do, not in accordance with the truth of God, but rather
with their own conjectures, that He was a magician. For they reproach
Christians as being destitute of skill; but Christ they laud as a
magician, and so betray what it is that they love: Christ indeed they do
not love, since what they love is that which Christ never was. And thus,
then, in both respects they are in error, for it is wicked to be a
magician; and as Christ was good, He was not a magician. Wherefore, as
we have nothing to say in this place of those who malign and blaspheme
Christ,—for it is of His glory we speak, wherewith He was glorified in
the world,—it was only in the holy Catholic Church that the Holy Spirit
glorified Him with His true glory. For elsewhere, that is, either among
heretics or certain pagans, the glory He has in the world cannot be a
true one, even where there is a generally accepted fame of Him
accompanied with praise. His true glory, therefore, in the Catholic
Church is celebrated in these words by the prophet: “Be thou exalted, O
God, above the heavens; and Thy glory above all the earth.”  <span
id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654.md) Accordingly, that after His
exaltation the Holy Spirit was to come, and to glorify Him, the sacred
psalm, and the Only-begotten Himself, promised as an event of the
future, which we see accomplished.

<span id="iii.ci-p11"></span>4. But when He says, “He shall receive of
mine, and shall show it unto you,” listen thereto with Catholic ears,
and receive it with Catholic minds. For not surely on that account, as
certain heretics have imagined, is the Holy Spirit inferior to the Son;
as if the Son received from the Father, and the Holy Spirit from the
Son, in reference to certain gradations of natures. Far be it from us to
believe this, or to say it, and from Christian hearts to think it. In
fine, He Himself straightway solved the question, and explained why He
said so. “All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore, said I,
that He shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you.” What would you
more? The Holy Spirit thus receives of the Father, of whom the Son
receives; for in this Trinity the Son is born of the Father, and from
the Father the Holy Spirit proceedeth. He, however, who is born of none,
and proceedeth from none, is the Father alone. But in what sense it is
that the only-begotten Son said, “All things that the Father hath are
mine” (for it certainly was not in the same sense as when it was said to
that son, who was not only begotten, but the elder of two, “Thou art
ever with me; and all that I have is thine),” <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655.md) will have our careful
consideration, if the Lord <span id="page_387">p. 387</span> <span
id="iii.ci-Page_387"></span>so will, in connection with the passage
where the Only-begotten saith to the Father, “And all mine are Thine,
and Thine are mine;” <span id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656.md) so that
our present discourse may be here brought to a close, as the words that
follow require a different opening for their discussion.
