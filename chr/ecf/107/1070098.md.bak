<span id="iii.xcvi-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.xcvi-p1.1"></span>Tractate XCV.</span>

<span id="iii.xcvi-p2"></span><span id="iii.xcvi-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.xcvi-p2.2"></span>Chapter XVI. 8–11</span>.

<span id="iii.xcvi-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.xcvi-p3.1"></span>The</span> Lord, when promising that He would
send the Holy Spirit, said, “When He is come, He will reprove the world
of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.” What does it mean? Is it
that the Lord Jesus Christ did not reprove the world of sin, when He
said, “If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but
now they have no cloak for their sin”? And that no one may take it to
his head to say that this applied <span id="page_369">p. 369</span>
<span id="iii.xcvi-Page_369"></span>properly to the Jews, and not to the
world, did He not say in another place, “If ye were of the world, the
world would love his own”? <span id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md)
Did He not reprove it of righteousness, when He said, “O righteous
Father, the world hath not known Thee”? <span
id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539.md) And did He not reprove it of
judgment when He declared that He would say to those on the left hand,
“Depart ye into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels”? <span id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540.md) And many other
passages are to be found in the holy evangel, where Christ reproveth the
world of these things. Why is it, then, He attributeth this to the Holy
Spirit, as if it were His proper prerogative? Is it that, because Christ
spake only among the nation of the Jews, He does not appear to have
reproved the world, inasmuch as one may be understood to be reproved who
actually hears the reprover; while the Holy Spirit, who was in His
disciples when scattered throughout the whole world, is to be understood
as having reproved not one nation, but the world? For mark what He said
to them when about to ascend into heaven: “It is not for you to know the
times or the moments, which the Father hath put in His own power. But ye
shall receive the power of the Holy Spirit, that cometh upon you: and ye
shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in
Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” <span
id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541.md) Surely this is to reprove the
world. But would any one venture to say that the Holy Spirit reproveth
the world through the disciples of Christ, and that Christ Himself doth
not, when the apostle exclaims, “Would ye receive a proof of Him that
speaketh in me, namely Christ?” <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542.md) And so those, surely, whom the Holy
Spirit reproveth, Christ reproveth likewise. But in my opinion, because
there was to be shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Spirit that
love <span id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md) which casteth out the
fear, <span id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md) that might have
hindered them from venturing to reprove the world which bristled with
persecutions, therefore it was that He said, “He shall reprove the
world:” as if He would have said, He shall shed abroad love in your
hearts, and, having your fear thereby expelled, ye shall have freedom to
reprove. We have frequently said, however, that the operations of the
Trinity are inseparable; <span id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md) but
the Persons needed to be set forth one by one, that not only without
separating Them, but also without confounding Them together, we may have
a right understanding both of Their Unity and Trinity.

<span id="iii.xcvi-p12"></span>2. He next explains what He has said “of
sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.” “Of sin indeed,” He says,
“because they have believed not on me.” For this sin, as if it were the
only one, He has put before the others; because with the continuance of
this one, all others are retained, and in the removal of this, the
others are remitted. “But of righteousness,” He adds, “because I go to
the Father, and ye shall see me no more.” And here we have to consider
in the first place, if any one is rightly reproved of sin, how he may
also be rightly reproved of righteousness. For if a sinner ought to be
reproved just because he is a sinner, will any one imagine that a
righteous man is also to be reproved because he is righteous? Surely
not. For if at any time a righteous man also is reproved, he is rightly
reproved on this account, that, according to Scripture, “There is not a
just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.” And accordingly,
when a righteous man is reproved, he is reproved of sin, and not of
righteousness. Since in that divine utterance also, where we read, “Be
not made righteous over-much,” <span
id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546.md) there is notice taken, not of the
righteousness of the wise man, but of the pride of the presumptuous. The
man, therefore, that becomes “righteous over-much,” by that very excess
becomes unrighteous. For he makes himself righteous over-much who says
that he has no sin, or who imagines that he is made righteous, not by
the grace of God, but by the sufficiency of his own will: nor is he
righteous through living righteously, but is rather self-inflated with
the imagination of being what he is not. By what means, then, is the
world to be reproved of righteousness, if not by the righteousness of
believers? Accordingly, it is convinced of sin, because it believeth not
on Christ; and it is convinced of the righteousness of those who do
believe. For the very comparison with believers is itself a reproving of
unbelievers. And this the exposition itself sufficiently indicates. For
in wishing to open up what He has said, He adds, “Of righteousness,
because I go to the Father, and ye shall see me no more.” He does not
say, And they shall see me no more; that is, those of whom He had said,
“because they have believed not on me.” Of them He spake, when
expounding what He denominated sin, in the words, “because they have
believed not on me;” but when expounding what He called righteousness,
whereof the world is convicted, He turned to those to whom He was
speaking, and said, “because I go to the Father, and ye shall see me no
more.” Wherefore it <span id="page_370">p. 370</span> <span
id="iii.xcvi-Page_370"></span>is of its own sins, but of others’
righteousness, that the world is convicted, just as darkness is reproved
by the light: “For all things,” says the apostle, “that are reproved,
are made manifest by the light.” <span
id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547.md) For the magnitude of the evil
chargeable on those who do not believe, may be made apparent not only by
itself, but also by the goodness of those who do believe. And since the
cry of unbelievers usually is, How can we believe what we do not see? so
the righteousness of unbelievers just required this very definition,
“Because I go to the Father, and ye shall see me no more.” For blessed
are they who see not, and yet do believe. <span
id="fr_1548"></span>[1549](#fn_1548.md) For of those also who saw Christ,
the faith in Him that met with commendation was not that they believed
what they saw, namely, the Son of man; but that they believed what they
did not see, namely, the Son of God. But after His servant-form was
itself also withdrawn from their view, then in every respect was the
word truly fulfilled, “The just liveth by faith.” <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[1550](#fn_1549.md) For “faith,” according to the
definition in the Epistle to the Hebrews, “is the confidence of those
that hope, <span id="fr_1550"></span>[1551](#fn_1550.md) the conviction of
things that are not seen.”

<span id="iii.xcvi-p18"></span>3. But how are we to understand, “Ye
shall see me no more”? For He saith not, I go to the Father, and ye
shall not see me, so as to be understood as referring to the interval of
time when He would not be seen, whether short or long, but at all events
terminable; but in saying, “Ye shall see me no more,” as if a truth
announced beforehand that they would never see Christ in all time
coming. Is this the righteousness we speak of, never to see Christ, and
yet to believe on Him; seeing that the faith whereby the just liveth is
commended on the very ground of believing that the Christ whom it seeth
not meanwhile, it shall see some day? Once more, in reference to this
righteousness, are we to say that the Apostle Paul was not righteous
when confessing that He had seen Christ after His ascension into
heaven, <span id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551.md) which was undoubtedly
the time of which He had already said, “Ye shall see me no more”? Was
Stephen, that hero of surpassing renown, not righteous in the spirit of
this righteousness, who, when they were stoning him, exclaimed, “Behold,
I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand
of God”? <span id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552.md) What, then, is meant
by “I go to the Father, and ye shall see me no more,” but just this, As
I am while with you now? For at that time He was still mortal in the
likeness of sinful flesh. <span id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553.md) He
could suffer hunger and thirst, be wearied, and sleep; and this Christ,
that is, Christ in such a condition, they were no more to see after He
had passed from this world to the Father; and such, also, is the
righteousness of faith, whereof the apostle says, “Though we have known
Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more.” <span
id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md) This, then, He says, will be your
righteousness whereof the world shall be reproved, “because I go to the
Father, and ye shall see me no more:” seeing that ye shall believe in me
as in one whom ye shall not see; and when ye shall see me as I shall be
then, ye shall not see me as I am while with you meanwhile; ye shall not
see me in my humility, but in my exaltation; nor in my mortality, but in
my eternity; nor at the bar, but on the throne of judgment: and by this
faith of yours, in other words, your righteousness, the Holy Spirit will
reprove an unbelieving world.

<span id="iii.xcvi-p23"></span>4. He will also reprove it “of judgment,
because the prince of this world is judged.” Who is this, save he of
whom He saith in another place, “Behold, the prince of the world cometh,
and shall find nothing in me;” <span
id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555.md) that is, nothing within his
jurisdiction, nothing belonging to him; in fact, no sin at all? For
thereby is the devil the prince of the world. For it is not of the
heavens and of the earth, and of all that is in them, that the devil is
prince, in the sense in which the world is to be understood, when it is
said, “And the world was made by Him;” but the devil is prince of that
world, whereof in the same passage He immediately afterwards subjoins
the words, “And the world knew Him not;” <span
id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556.md) that is, unbelieving men, wherewith
the world through its utmost extent is filled: among whom the believing
world groaneth, which He, who made the world, chose out of the world;
and of whom He saith Himself, “The Son of man came not to judge the
world, but that the world through Him might be saved.” <span
id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md) He is the judge by whom the world
is condemned, the helper whereby the world is saved: for just as a tree
is full of foliage and fruit, or a field of chaff and wheat, so is the
world full of believers and unbelievers. Therefore the prince of this
world, that is, the prince of the darkness thereof, or of unbelievers,
out of whose hands that world is rescued, to which it is said, “Ye were
at one time darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord:”  <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558.md) the prince of this world, of whom
He elsewhere saith, “Now is the prince of this world cast out,” <span
id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559.md) is assuredly judged, inas <span
id="page_371">p. 371</span> <span id="iii.xcvi-Page_371"></span>much as
he is irrevocably destined to the judgment of everlasting fire. And so
of this judgment, by which the prince of the world is judged, is the
world reproved by the Holy Spirit; for it is judged along with its
prince, whom it imitates in its own pride and impiety. “For if God,” in
the words of the Apostle Peter, “spared not the angels that sinned, but
thrust them into prisons of infernal darkness, and gave them up to be
reserved for punishment in the judgment,” <span
id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560.md) how is the world otherwise than
reproved of this judgment by the Holy Spirit, when it is in the Holy
Spirit that the apostle so speaketh? Let men, therefore, believe in
Christ, that they be not convicted of the sin of their own unbelief,
whereby all sins are retained: let them make their way into the number
of believers, that they be not convicted of the righteousness of those,
whom, as justified, they fail to imitate: let them beware of that future
judgment, that they be not judged with the prince of the world, whom,
judged as he is, they continue to imitate. For the unbending pride of
mortals can have no thought of being spared itself, as it is thus called
to think with terror of the punishment that overtook the pride of
angels.
