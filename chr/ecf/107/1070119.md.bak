id="iii.cxvii-p1.1"></span>Tractate CXVI.</span>

<span id="iii.cxvii-p2"></span><span id="iii.cxvii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.cxvii-p2.2"></span>Chapter XIX. 1–16</span>.

<span id="iii.cxvii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.cxvii-p3.1"></span>On</span> the Jews crying out that they did
not wish Jesus to be released unto them at the passover, but Barabbas
the robber; not the Saviour, but the murderer; not the Giver of life,
but the destroyer,—“then Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him.” We must
believe that Pilate acted thus for no other reason than that the Jews,
glutted with the injuries done to Him, might consider themselves
satisfied, and desist from madly pursuing Him even unto death. With a
similar intention was it that, as governor, he also permitted his cohort
to do what follows, or even perhaps ordered them, although the
evangelist is silent on the subject. For he tells us what the soldiers
did thereafter, but not that Pilate ordered it. “And the soldiers,” he
says, “platted a crown of thorns, and put it on His head, and they
clothed Him with a purple robe. And they came to Him and said, Hail,
King of the Jews! And they smote Him with their hands.” Thus were
fulfilled the very things which Christ had foretold of Himself; thus
were the martyrs moulded for the endurance of all that their persecutors
should be pleased to inflict; thus, by concealing for a time the terror
of His power, He commended to us the prior imitation of His patience;
thus the kingdom which was not of this world overcame that proud world,
not by the ferocity of fighting, but by the humility of suffering; and
thus the grain of corn that was yet to be multiplied was sown amid the
horrors of shame, that it might come to fruition amid the wonders of
glory.

<span id="iii.cxvii-p4"></span>2. “Pilate went forth again, and saith
unto them, Behold, I bring him forth, that ye may know that I find no
fault in him. Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns and the
purple robe. And he saith unto them, Behold the man!” Hence it is
apparent that these things were done by the soldiers not without
Pilate’s knowledge, whether it was that he ordered them or only
permitted them, namely, for the reason we have stated above, that His
enemies might all the more willingly drink in the sight of such derisive
treatment, and cease to thirst further for His blood. Jesus goes forth
to them wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, not resplendent
in kingly power, but laden with reproach; and the words are addressed to
them, Behold the man! If you hate your king, spare him now when you see
him sunk so low; he has been scourged, crowned with thorns, clothed with
the garments of derision, jeered at with the bitterest insults, struck
with the open hand; his ignominy is at the boiling point, let your
ill-will sink to zero. But there is no such cooling on the part of the
latter, but rather a further increase of heat and vehemence.

<span id="iii.cxvii-p5"></span>3. “When the chief priests, therefore,
and <span id="page_426">p. 426</span> <span
id="iii.cxvii-Page_426"></span>attendants saw Him, they cried out,
saying, Crucify, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them Take ye him and
crucify him; for I find no fault in him. The Jews answered him, We have
a law, and by the law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of
God.” Behold another and still greater ground of hatred. The former,
indeed, seemed but a small matter, as that shown towards the usurpation,
by an unlawful act of daring, of the royal power; and yet of neither did
Jesus falsely claim possession, but each of them is truly His as both
the only-begotten Son of God, and by Him appointed King upon His holy
hill of Zion; and both might He now have shown to be His, were it not
that in proportion to the greatness of His power, He preferred to
manifest the corresponding greatness of His patience.

<span id="iii.cxvii-p6"></span>4. “When Pilate, therefore, heard that
saying, he was the more afraid; and entered again into the judgment
hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no
answer.” It is found, in comparing the narratives of all the
evangelists, that this silence on the part of our Lord Jesus Christ took
place more than once, both before the chief priests and before Herod, to
whom, as Luke intimates, Pilate had sent Him for a hearing, and before
Pilate himself;  <span id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850.md) so that it
was not in vain that the prophecy regarding Him had preceded, “As the
lamb before its shearer was dumb, so He opened not His mouth,” <span
id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851.md) especially on those occasions when
He answered not His questioners. For although He frequently replied to
questions addressed to Him, yet because of those in regard to which He
declined making any reply, the metaphor of the lamb is supplied, in
order that in His silence He might be accounted not as guilty, but
innocent. When, therefore, He was passing through the process of
judgment, wherever He opened not His mouth it was in the character of a
lamb that He did so; that is, not as one with an evil conscience who was
convicted of his sins, but as one who in His meekness was sacrificed for
the sins of others.

<span id="iii.cxvii-p9"></span>5. “Then saith Pilate unto Him, Speakest
thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee,
and have power to release thee? Jesus answered: Thou wouldest have no
power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he
that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.” Here, you see, He
replied; and yet wherever He replied not, it is not as one who is
criminal or cunning, but as a lamb; that is, in simplicity and innocence
He opened not His mouth. Accordingly, where He made no answer, He was
silent as a sheep; where He answered, He taught as the Shepherd. Let us
therefore set ourselves to learn what He said, what He taught also by
the apostle, that “there is no power but of God;” <span
id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md) and that he is a greater sinner who
maliciously delivereth up to the power the innocent to be slain, than
the power itself, if it slay him through fear of another power that is
greater still. Of such a sort, indeed, was the power which God had given
to Pilate, that he should also be under the power of Cæsar. Wherefore
“thou wouldest have,” He says, “no power against me,” that is, even the
little measure thou really hast, “except” this very measure, whatever
its amount, “were given thee from above.” But knowing as I do its
amount, for it is not so great as to render thee altogether independent,
“therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.” He,
indeed, delivered me to thy power at the bidding of envy, whilst thou
art to exercise thy power upon me through the impulse of fear. And yet
not even through the impulse of fear ought one man to slay another,
especially the innocent; nevertheless to do so by an officious zeal is a
much greater evil than under the constraint of fear. And therefore the
truth-speaking Teacher saith not, “He that delivered me to thee,” he
only hath sin, as if the other had none; but He saith, “hath the greater
sin,” letting him understand that he himself was not exempt from blame.
For that of the latter is not reduced to nothing because the other is
greater.

<span id="iii.cxvii-p11"></span>6. “Hence Pilate sought to release Him.”
What is to be understood by the word here used, “hence,” <span
id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md) as if he had not been seeking to do
so before? Read what precedes, and thou wilt find that he had already
for some time been seeking to release Jesus. By the original word, <span
id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854.md) therefore, we are to understand,
*on this account*, that is, *for this reason*, that he might not
contract sin by slaying an innocent man who had been delivered into his
hands, even though his sin would be less than that of the Jews, who
delivered Him to him to be put to death. “From thence,” <span
id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md) therefore, that is, for this
reason, that he might not commit such a sin, “he sought” not now for the
first time, but from the beginning, “to release Him.”

<span id="iii.cxvii-p15"></span>7. “But the Jews cried out, saying, If
thou let this man go, thou art not Cæsar’s <span id="page_427">p.
427</span> <span id="iii.cxvii-Page_427"></span>friend: whosoever maketh
himself a king, speaketh against Cæsar.” They thought to inspire Pilate
with greater fear by terrifying him about Cæsar, in order that he might
put Christ to death, than formerly when they said, “We have the law, and
by the law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.” It
was not their law, indeed, that impelled him through fear to the deed of
murder, but rather it was his fear of the Son of God that held him back
from the crime. But now he could not set Cæsar, who was the author of
his own power, at nought, in the same way as the law of another nation.

<span id="iii.cxvii-p16"></span>8. As yet, however, the evangelist
proceeds to say: “But when Pilate heard these sayings, he brought Jesus
forth, and sat down before the tribunal, in a place that is called the
Pavement, <span id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) but in the Hebrew,
Gabbatha. And it was the preparation <span
id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) of the passover, and about the
sixth hour.” The question, at what hour the Lord was crucified, because
of the testimony supplied by another evangelist, who says, “And it was
the third hour, and they crucified Him,” <span
id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) we shall consider as we can, if the
Lord please, when we are come to the passage itself where His
crucifixion is recorded. <span id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md) When
Pilate, therefore, had sat down before the tribunal, “he saith unto the
Jews, Behold your king! But they cried out, Away with him, away with
him, crucify him. Pilate said unto them, Shall I crucify your king?” As
yet he tries to overcome the terror with which they had inspired him
about Cæsar, by seeking to break them from their purpose on the ground
of the ignominy it brought on themselves, with the words, “Shall I
crucify your king?” when he failed to soften them on the ground of the
ignominy done to Christ; but by and by he is overcome by fear.

<span id="iii.cxvii-p21"></span>9. For “the chief priests answered, We
have no king but Cæsar. Then delivered he Him therefore unto them to be
crucified.” For he would have every appearance of acting against Cæsar
if, on their declaration that they had no king but Cæsar, he were
wishing to impose on them another king by releasing without punishment
one whom for these very attempts they had delivered unto him to be put
to death. “Therefore he delivered Him unto them to be crucified.” But
was it, then, anything different that he had previously desired when he
said, “Take ye him, and crucify him;” or even earlier still, “Take ye
him, and judge him according to your law?” And why did they show so
great reluctance, when they said, “It is not lawful for us to put any
man to death,” <span id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md) and were in
every way urgent to have Him slain not by themselves, but by the
governor, and therefore refused to receive Him for the purpose of
putting Him to death, if now for the same purpose they actually do
receive Him? Or if such be not the case, why was it said, “Then
delivered he Him therefore unto them to be crucified?” Or is it of any
importance? Plainly it is. For it was not said, “Then delivered he Him
therefore unto them” that they might crucify Him, but “that He might be
crucified,” that is, that He might be crucified by the judicial sentence
and power of the governor. But it is for this reason that the evangelist
has said that He was delivered to them, that he might show that they
were implicated in the crime from which they tried to hold themselves
aloof; for Pilate would have done no such thing, save to implement what
he perceived to be their fixed desire. The words, however, that follow,
“And they took Jesus, and led Him away,” may now refer to the soldiers,
the attendants of the governor. For it is more clearly stated
afterwards, “When the soldiers therefore had crucified Him,” <span
id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md) although the evangelist properly
does so even when he attributes the whole to the Jews, for they it was
that received what they had with the utmost greediness demanded, and
they it was that did all that they compelled to be done. But the events
that follow must be made the subject of consideration in another
discourse.
