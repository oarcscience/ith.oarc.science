id="iii.lxxxi-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXXX.</span>

<span id="iii.lxxxi-p2"></span><span id="iii.lxxxi-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lxxxi-p2.2"></span>Chapter XV. 1–3</span>.

<span id="iii.lxxxi-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxxxi-p3.1"></span>This</span> passage of the Gospel, brethren,
where the Lord calls Himself the vine, and His disciples the branches,
declares in so many words that the Mediator between God and men, the man
Christ Jesus, <span id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377) is the head of
the Church, and that we are His members. For as the vine and its
branches are of one nature, therefore, His own nature as God being
different from ours, He became man, that in Him human nature might be
the vine, and we who also are men might become branches thereof. What
mean, then, the words, “I am the true vine”? Was it to the literal vine,
from which that metaphor was drawn, that <span id="page_344">p.
344</span> <span id="iii.lxxxi-Page_344"></span>He intended to point
them by the addition of “true”? For it is by similitude, and not by any
personal propriety, that He is thus called a vine; just as He is also
termed a sheep, a lamb, a lion, a rock, a corner-stone, and other names
of a like kind, which are themselves rather the *true* ones, from which
these are drawn as similitudes, not as realities. But when He says, “I
am the true vine,” it is to distinguish Himself, doubtless, from that
\[vine\] to which the words are addressed: “How art thou turned into
sourness,  <span id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378) as a strange
vine?” <span id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379) For how could that be
a true vine which was expected to bring forth grapes and brought forth
thorns? <span id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380)

<span id="iii.lxxxi-p8"></span>2. “I am,” He says, “the true vine, and
my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit,
He taketh away; and every one that beareth fruit, He purgeth it, that it
may bring forth more fruit.” Are, then, the husbandman and the vine one?
Christ is the vine in the same sense as when He said, “The Father is
greater than I;” <span id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381) but in that
sense wherein He said, “I and my Father are one,” He is also the
husbandman. And yet not such a one as those, whose whole service is
confined to external labor; but such, that He also supplies the increase
from within. “For neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that
watereth; but God that giveth the increase.” But Christ is certainly
God, for the Word was God; and so He and the Father are one: and if the
Word was made flesh,—that which He was not before,—He nevertheless still
remains what He was. And still more, after saying of the Father, as of
the husbandman, that He taketh away the fruitless branches, and pruneth
the fruitful, that they may bring forth more fruit, He straightway
points to Himself as also the purger of the branches, when He says, “Now
ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.” Here, you
see, He is also the pruner of the branches—a work which belongs to the
husbandman, and not to the vine; and more than that, He maketh the
branches His workmen. For although they give not the increase, they
afford some help; but not of themselves: “For without me,” He says, “ye
can do nothing.” And listen, also, to their own confession: “What, then,
is Apollos, and what is Paul? but ministers by whom ye believed, even as
the Lord gave to every man. I have planted, Apollos watered.” And this,
too, “as the Lord gave to every man;” and so not of themselves. In that,
however, which follows, “but God gave the increase,” <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382) He works not by them, but by
Himself; for work like that exceeds the lowly capacity of man,
transcends the lofty powers of angels, and rests solely and entirely in
the hands of the Triune Husbandman. “Now ye are clean,” that is, clean,
and yet still further to be cleansed. For, had they not been clean, they
could not have borne fruit; and yet every one that beareth fruit is
purged by the husbandman, that he may bring forth more fruit. He bears
fruit because he is clean; and to bear more, he is cleansed still
further. For who in this life is so clean as not to be in need of still
further and further cleansing? seeing that, “if we say that we have no
sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us; but if we confess
our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse
us from all unrighteousness;” to cleanse in very deed the clean, that
is, the fruitful, that they may be so much the more fruitful, as they
have been made the cleaner.

<span id="iii.lxxxi-p11"></span>3. “Now ye are clean through the word
which I have spoken unto you. Why does He not say, Ye are clean through
the baptism wherewith ye have been washed, but “through the word which I
have spoken unto you,” save only that in the water also it is the word
that cleanseth? Take away the word, and the water is neither more nor
less than water. The word is added to the element, and there results the
Sacrament, as if itself also a kind of visible word. For He had said
also to the same effect, when washing the disciples’ feet, “He that is
washed needeth not, save to wash his feet, but is clean every
whit.” <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383) And whence has water
so great an efficacy, as in touching the body to cleanse the soul, save
by the operation of the word; and that not because it is uttered, but
because it is believed? For even in the word itself the passing sound is
one thing, the abiding efficacy another. “This is the word of faith
which we preach,” says the apostle, “that if thou shalt confess with thy
mouth that Jesus is the Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God
hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart
man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made
unto salvation.” <span id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384) Accordingly,
we read in the Acts of the Apostles, “Purifying their hearts by
faith;” <span id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385) and, says the blessed
Peter in his epistle, “Even as <span id="page_345">p. 345</span> <span
id="iii.lxxxi-Page_345"></span>baptism doth also now save us, not the
putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386) of a good conscience.” “This is the
word of faith which we preach,” whereby baptism, doubtless, is also
consecrated, in order to its possession of the power to cleanse. For
Christ, who is the vine with us, and the husbandman with the Father,
“loved the Church, and gave Himself for it.” And then read the apostle,
and see what he adds: “That He might sanctify it, cleansing it with the
washing of water by the word.” <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387) The cleansing, therefore, would on
no account be attributed to the fleeting and perishable element, were it
not for that which is added, “by the word.” This word of faith possesses
such virtue in the Church of God, that through the medium of him who in
faith presents, and blesses, and sprinkles it, He cleanseth even the
tiny infant, although itself unable as yet with the heart to believe
unto righteousness, and to make confession with the mouth unto
salvation. All this is done by means of the word, whereof the Lord
saith, “Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.”
